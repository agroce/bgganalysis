I can see this working in a pub (if you can keep the cards from getting wet).  I can even see that it would have worked on a real pirate ship.  It's quite a lot of fun, but there's not really a lot going on.  There are tactics, but I don't think that these are very deep.  Still, I would play this most times.

Seems like a nice game but quite vicious and generally ends up with rivalries forming over having your pieces stolen at inopportune times, then retaliating for no real reason other than to exct revenge since its not a serious game. So in summary a fun experience but doesn't seem a very interesting as a game.

This is a very light hearted pirate game that plays really well only when played as a light filler.  The game play is simple, but offers up some options for good strategy.  Lots of second guessing what your opponents will do.  Has a potential for too much take-that against one player. [GTI: AGSL]

Bidding game which meshes its ideas well.  Plays quickly but I didn't particularly warm to the game.  I think it is probably the pirate theme which is not a favorite.

This is used to be a exquiste expansion for Rum & Pirates from Mr. Stefan Feld. This game lasts 5 rounds, too! And it fits thematic and graphic well to the Big Alea Game of 2006. So i decided to fusion them. 
At day they sail out to capture some ships, so they also mixing the crew members as well. And after completing the crews they engage the merchant-ships, loot some candleholder & cutlass and divide the booty.The pirates fight at night for the best places to sleep, after a shoping evening, treasure map exchange and some strong drinks in the prefered local bar. 
So the game starts for the 1st round with 5 men (colored wooden disks) at the sea. After 3 merchants were plundered, the mixed crew stacks, return to the city-harbor. Each player have to pay out your crew stayed at home. Each man receives 1 Sterling, then you can exchange your remained sea-sterlings to town-dublons (exchange rate: 8 for 1 dublon). 
After another rumbeling evening and struggle for the best places to sleep, all players set sail for 2nd plunder with their 5 well-rested Buccaneers, the other crew mates are still to drunk for a new raid!

4/24/06 - I might play this with less than the full compliment but it is definitely best with 5. This game has a memory component coupled with maximizing your return on boarding ships while paying out very little to your crew. Ahh to be a pirate captain stabbing your crew in the back. But keep your first mate happy and throw him a bone when you board the ships that have two treasures. Fun, quick game and I understand the SdJ nomination - it is family fun for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Tedious, boring game. Memory is an important element here, which already makes the game less appealing to me, but the biggest problem is how haphazard the gameplay is. I may be an idiot, but I just don't see any strategy. 

Everyone kind of puts their pieces on others, hoping that someone else will choose their stack next turn. Boarding is anticlimactic, and no one really knows who is winning until the end (and then can't figure out what exactly the winner did better than the other players).

RATING: 6
Although I was initally taken with Buccaneer due to its innate cleverness, I've recently been forced to dock my rating. It's not so much that the game is bad - I think it's a really clever take on an auction game, and Dorra is about the only one other than Knizia who can even do good auction games reliably (not that he's in Knizia's league). The problem is just one of length - Buccaneer reliably takes an hour when it wants to be 30 minutes.  I think Buccaneer would be just fine if played with younger or family gamers, but hobby gamers seem prone to way overthinking this one, dragging it out well past its expiration date.

It is deeper than it first seems.  Rules were vague in exactly how the game starts, but once we worked through it everyone had fun. I watched other people play the game and admit I was dumbfounded as to what in the world was going on, but after playing it am amazed at how simple the game is mechanically, but how difficult to figure out.  One of the few games where the more players drastically improves the game.

This one is built to play quick.  The only problem is that it doesn't...it drags along with AP, basically over nothing, because the amount of control you have is minimal.  I think the AP is due to the fact that on your turn, 85% of the time, there is no great move.  Usually there is not even a good move.  It seems that there are alot of even play moves, or ones that hurt, and people try to find any slight advantage.  Usually, I found myself looking at moves to help players who were behind just to balance the game from those who had an early lead, rather than finding a way to help myself.  With the table randomness, there was very little you could do to assure yourself of doing something to better your position.  If it played as fast as For Sale, I would say ok, but this one was way too long.

This is a light game with a decent flair (and a great theme).  Plays quickly, and the rules are pretty straight forward - move a pirate, or take a ship.  The strategy, on the other hand, will take some time to learn.  But a fun, light pirate game nonetheless.

RATING: 5
Played twice with 4 and 5 players.  The components are lovely. The rules are simple. The mechanics are fresh and the game itself feels very unique. The theme works well with the mechanics. 

With increasing numbers of players it just gets really chaotic. You have little control over your own score. There ARE things you can do to make it more likely that you score, but in the end it seems like its just a game of figuring out who is in the lead and crank on them (make it hard for them to score). Generally, whoever captains a boat gets a large advantage and its up to other players to allow someone to keep a stack sufficient to be the captain on a later turn. 

I think maybe this game would work really well with 3p. I'd like to try it again with that number.  The chaos is decreased and you get a higher density of actions in the game. I could see how your choices then actually make a difference, whereas in a 5p game its really pretty random who wins. 

Overall, I didn't really enjoy playing this one because I didn't feel I had control over my fate. I really wanted to like it, and will give it another shot, but I doubt it gets much better.

This didn't do much for me. It may or may not have something to do with the fact that I had play 10 hours of games prior to being taught this, and was a bit tired. Still, the one thing I'm pretty sure of is that I don't really like memory in games. Some would argue that "it's not that important" to remember the exact values of the tokens in a ship stack. The problem is, it can make the difference between making a few bucks verses losing a few bucks. I also don't like the rule that you can't pass if you have a legal move. Your moves can be "taken away" by others taking your tokens, so you can't plan on how many turns you're going to get before you're going to have to claim a boat. I just felt a general sense of not enough control. But that was only with one play. I'd be willing to play again, but wouldn't request it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The subject of this game is nice, but gameplay is a bit weird. You want low-numbered pirates in stacks you control and then cover them with a high-numbered pirate of your own, but people are usually way too clever for this to happen uncontestedly. It becomes a bit of a muddled memory game at that point which in my limited experience has a tendency to get in the way of the game itself, although it has some interesting game-of-chicken mechanics. I also noticed that the chits are not that important; they make up only about 15% of your total score. That might be sufficient to win the game, but in general the only viable strategy is 'entering a ship with the lowest required number of pirates, most of which are under your command'. 

Despite numerous lengthy conversations with the people I played with, we were not able to come up with good strategic ideas. My partners did stress time and time again that 'there was a lot in this game', but I have a slightly nagging feeling this is slang for 'we're not sure what to make of it yet'. I might sell this game off one day, as there are better games in my collection which scratch the same itch.

Two plays, and whilst play improves I'm still concerned that it could be fairly random as you lose control of bits.  Endgame seemed a bit strange as people took stacks to stop people being able to take a ship.

There was something going on here but I didn't quite connect with the mechanism. But a lot depends upon other players choices and I'm happy to play this again, perhaps with 5 instead of 3 players.

This is difficult to do and really depends on fellow players. That means that, in some groups, your destiny is not really in your hands. However, when everybody plays well, the game must be a lot more tactical and interesting.

Buccaneer is a decent game with a little memory aspect and some interesting mechanics. However it has the complexity of what should be a 15-20 minute filler and it takes closer to 45 or even an hour.

Fun game with surprisingly many choices. Of course it's still a filler but a satysfying one - the luck of the ship cards doesn't determine the winner. It's how you play that makes your score.

Simple rules, nice bits and streamlined gameplay. It won't any win any major award but it's definitely worth trying.

Now that I have played this again I think my original assessment still stands: good, not bad, not great.  It makes for a nice little change of pace and there is a little bit of thought to it.  It doesn't jump out enough for me to want to own it especially since I own too many games as it is.  I will happily play it again and see if my opinion improves over time.

rating after one play - fun chaotic filler though our first game took a bit longer than typical filler.  played a 4 player game.  it's hard to remain captain of a crew as everyone is stealing each others stacks of pirates.  it feels like there is more to think about than with typical filler, but with the volatility of the play, it's probably best not to think too hard about this one.

Light groupthink filler. Some kingmaker-y impulses throughout. Never really feel too "satisfied" when winning nor disappointed when losing, because even though it feels like there's choices, there's not a huge need for strategy or tactics. Glad to have played it but would rather play other games when I have 20-30 minutes to kill.

RATING: N/A
I'm not going to rate this, as I'd give it a 3 on the way scores are done here - which it doesn't deserve. I'd say it's probably a 5 or 6. The reason I won't rate it is because it just rubbed me up the wrong way so badly, but the others I was playing with seemed to enjoy themselves.

The theme is pasted on - you at no point feel piratey. It's a memory game; I'm not a fan of those. And it's a puzzler too - again, not really my thing. And that's it. Even though it was short I was bored quickly and wanted it to stop after about 10 minutes. I won't play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After one play, I'm not sure that I understand the strategy.  I just can't value ships, because I don't know how much the future ships will be worth.  This is potentially a memory game -- those who remember what values of pirates are in each stack, and who can track what ships are coming up, would have a big advantage.

I wouldn't be against playing this game again, but it doesn't do a lot for me.  I don't care to track the contents of each pirate stack, and while there is clearly some skill to deciding which stacks are likely to board ships, it requires a bit of social intelligence I lack.  The area-majority scoring of the special items isn't one of my favorite mechanics either.

Not a bad game, but not really my type.  Plays quickly though.

My only problem with this game is that if all of the other players hire your pirates, you can have turns where you end up doing absolutely nothing!

I love the recruiting of your crews, and the memory element... there's just something here that keeps the game from being a lot of fun... and I can't pin it down.

Until that 'first impression' goes away, I', only giving the game a '6'.

I went to the high seas and I all I got was this lousy candelabra.

A 3 player game sometimes felt like the old street hustle where you have 3 shells and try and work out which one has the pea under it by following the movement of the shells - on the street you never win but on the high seas it seems the most agressive pirate does.  I was seriously non-plussed about the game and feel I may have to be press ganged into this next time, the mechanics were fine but for some reason  which I am unable to articulate it didn't capture my imagination (maybe Pirate-fatigue). After Buccaneer I feel life on the high seas as a pirate is not for me.

RATING: 4
After ~10 plays.  What I don't like: there doesn't seem to be any room for big, game changing moments.  The game is a "one inch at a time" affair, and it's missing grand sweep.  This would be a deal-breaker for most games, but somehow, it works for this game, which is both soothing and short.  What I like: the rules are a breeze and the act of moving stacks around has a very satisfying, tactile aspect.  Also, though many people call this game light, and it surely is in terms of the simplicity of the rules, and the fun to be had stacking pirates, it is not really light.  This game could be studied hard core.  There's a whole lot going on that is not necessarily obvious to begin with.  

After more plays: this is a deeply opaque game to me.  What on earth is going on?  I have no idea, but I strongly suspect that this is going to turn into a negotiation game, since most of the time you want to convince opponents to put particular pirates of yours into their stacks.  I haven't tried it, since one of the people that I play this with hates negotiation.  In any case, I see many accusations of chaos/randomness in the other comments here; I'm convinced that this is really just lack of understanding.  Dorra is like a senior-level Jedi when it comes to hiding deep stuff in unassuming wrappers, and I think this game is going to end up another example of this.

After a few more plays.  The opacity of this game, coupled with the incremental feel of gameplay, finally did this game in for me.  Now I'm just bored.

A decent filler type game with some interesting decisions between taking over a "stack" (it's Dorra after all) or a ship.

Each player has 5 disks, with pirate values from 2,3,4,5 and a "?" value. Three ships are flipped up. Players either put out one of their disks, put a disk on top of a current stack of disks to take control of the stack, or board a ship with a stack they control.  When boarding a ship, the top disk gets their choice of treasure, second disk gets what is left. The loot is printed on the card, and all other disks earn their owner money equal to value in money. The trick is that the captain (person with disk on top), must pay out the money from the loot on the ship, and if it is not enough, from their own pocket! The ? value depends on the ship being boarded.  At the end, treasure is converted to money, for those who own the majority in those treasures. It's a quick, fun and light game.

It's one of those games where you'll do well only if others let you do well - ie you only get to score if the other players leave a score pile in front of you by the time it's your turn again. Didn't find anything interesting, engaging or fun unfortunately. Basically it's keep piling your chips on stacks until the stacks are deployed to ships, and then score the chips for the ships.

RATING: 8
This game is much more then meets the eye. You wouldn't guess by the way it looks that it might actually make you use your brains. YOu need to do some basic calculations to figure whether assaulting a ship is or not worthwhile, since you need to pay the whole crew, and that is where the game actually shines. The crew you use to assault the ship is a combinations of your pirate(s) and some of the other players' pirates. So you need to pay other players, and if you don't earn enough with an assoult you don't go out only empty-handed, but you also need to pay the other players out of your own pocket. The problem is that the different ships can only be assaulted by crews of specific sizes, and if not careful you end up with a crew far greater then a ship requires and that's when you lose big time, you also need to remember what pirates are in your crew, since every player has 5 different pirates and each one of those costs a different amount... you will have you head spinning around very soon... And still this game is very fast paced, you play it in little time, players have a great laugh, the components are very nice and it is a smalle sized QueenGames format. In all a very fun game and a satisfying addition to my collection, I recomend it to anyone who enjoys a light but not brainless, fast-paced game.

Very nice, dig the crew-creating mechanism. 20 mins to play, easy to teach. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
You board ships with a collection of crew members, some belonging to you and some to other players. By doing so you gain money and possibly a treasure by being the captain of that crew. On your turn, you can either board a ship with a current stack (crew) or place a stack of one or more in which you are on top, onto another stack of one or more, forming a new larger crew. Timing has a huge impact and you cannot always be the captain and gain the treasure (which leads to more gold), so simply try and be included in each ship boarding. No need to play ahead, just hope for the best and include your more powerful pieces in stacks.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a cute little game, but it didn't really seem to have much substance.  I guess if you were really into it, you could add up the values of various stacks (assuming you memorized their contents) and be able to figure out what's worth it and what's not.  Doesn't seem like it's worth the effort, though.  Short of that, it's hard to devise any sort of working strategy, because the game changes so much from one turn to the next.

A great little game - readily accepted by beginners. One can explain the rules in less than 5 minutes and the game itself plays in about half an hour even with the full set of 5 players. 

The mechanics are very enjoyable - some set collection, some bidding and some backstabbing. I don't know of another game that is quite like this one.

After the first play, my player group immediately wanted to play it again, which, considering the choice of games available to us, says quite a lot. :)

I am very happy I bough this game.

Requires much more thought, than it appears at first glance, a deceptively simple game.
 
Can you get your high value pirates into other players stacks - and have their lower value ones in your. 

With the ships having different payouts, but requiring a minimum number of pirates to "capture", gives you a nice optimization problem as you try to balance what you get from the ship with what you have to pay to the other players.

A clever little game with a nice theme that works well, despite being so thinly spread over the game. The core mechanic, which is stacking your pirate discs on top of each other and thus making it possible to attack ships and still being able to see who is part of the crew in the first place is really what this game is all about. Good, keen to play more

I'm not sure about the rest, but the game was fun. It takes about 2 minutes of explaining the game (end scoring mainly) and everyone can have fun. Reminded me of when I played Dvonn in the past, only because of the stacking. Causing a Mutiny was great fun. It will definitely have some same-o-thing problems, but as a filler once in a while it will work great. Worst boarding we had - 25 point ship and the captain lost 3 dollars. It was hillarious!

RATING: 5
Simple mechanic, but difficult calculation of values. Each turn you're doing one of two things. 1. Placing your single or stack of pirates onto other pirates or stacks of pirates to increase the power of your pirate ship under your captaincy. 2. Launching a pirate raid on one of the available target ships and dividing up the booty between you and your crew (the other players), based upon their value between 1-6. Most money at the end wins. Most treasure tiles in four categories gets a value between 6-15.

It takes about half an hour to play and it's okay. Lacks some sort of spark. Maybe it's just too simplistic for my taste and with too much calculation? Can't quite put my finger on why it doesn't grab me.

A very interesting game with a pirate theme.  It took a little while for me to figure out how it worked.

Kellemes átvezető játék. Hajókat kell kirabolni egymástól összegyűjtött kalózokkal, emiatt nagy az interaktivitás a játékban. Jól kitalált, jól működő mechanizmusa van. Viszont az, hogy kitől mikor veszünk el nem éppen kiegyensúlyozott dolog, így figyelmetlenebb játékos kerülhet teljesen kiszolgáltatott helyzetbe is.

This is a cute tactical exercise.  I'm not sure how much strategy there is to the game, but I found the experience to be quite a bit of fun.  Mostly I found this game to revolve around trying to get in on the most deals by allowing others to close out with your stacks.  Not a whole lot here, but the decisions that you do make yield entertaining consequences.

tentative rating based on just 1 play.  This plays easily in a lunch, so it will see more plays as the year goes by.  It is fun, and deep enough that we don't have a clear strat yet, which is pretty cool in such a simple game.  May be a little mathy since stacks are hidden info, but you can, at least sometimes, figure out what's in them by seeing what's still showing--that could be trouble for the AP prone.

This does however, win the prize for best thematic relation in a short simple game!  Amazing--hire and captain pirates, share the booty, raid ships, gather booty, it's all there!

Played this again last night and for the first time got the rule about all three ship cards have to be captured before three new ship cards come out.  This changes things!

People tried to time being ready to buy when a new crop would become available, and it made the interplay more interesting.  [My German edition is called Seerauber.]

Buccaneer is game that I needed half a dozen plays to appreciate. If I hadn't bought it by chance, I doubt that I would have perservered past the initial few games. The problem is that developing a stratgegy is not that easy to begin with and it all seems a bit to random and a lot more effort than it's worth. However, once it all fits into place it has quite a neat bidding mechanism, plays a lot quicker and it has had many plays recently. I've upped my rating to 6.5 for the time being and after another ten games I'll review whether I deem it to be a 7 or 6.

Initial review after 3 games: 5
Compared to For Sale, it's 5 times the effort for a fifth of the Fun. Nice components though.

This is quite a good light game.  The theme's fun and the pieces are very nice.  Outcome is a little bit random but you're at least teased into believing that you might have had some influence on it.  30 minute length is about right.

Played 3  times.  Good little pirate game about storming law abiding ships at port with group of scurvy dogs, divvying up the treasure and saying Argh!.  Argh saying is optional.  A bit of chaos, a bit of strategy and a bunch of fun mixed together.  The neat mechanic is that each pirate needs to be paid according to his rank.  So if you take a stack of pirates to board a ship, you could end up paying more to the other players than the booty on the ship.  2006/07/06

tl;dr: enjoyable family game

This is by no means a special or deep game, but it does accomplish what it sets out to do: offer enjoyable, family friendly Pirate struggles. The most fun comes from figuring out when to add your pirates to a stack and when to create a new stack.
The treasures can be pretty powerful, but it is also possible to win without ever being the captain or scoring points fore the treasure tiles. That's pretty cool, because most games like this usually only have 1 path to victory.
So I enjoy playing this game, and it accomplishes it's goal. But that goal, we have to recognize, is not all that lofty. Still. Good fun with the right group.

Another one of these Queen games that looks friendly with its cartoony art, but has a reasonable potential for viciousness. There's lots of noise and the game is so fast, it becomes (intentionally, I think) hard to track the tiles.

Eh. A disappointing Dorra design that slaps a pirate theme on dull game mechanics to no avail.

Buccaneer is so light and fast that it's hard to complain.  Although there's a simple trick to playing it, a larger strategy isn't needed to have a series of enjoyable and interesting decisions.  Buccaneer has good production values and it's great for all ages.

I'm a sucker for the pirate theme...although the theme comes through somewhat weak in this game. It's an alright light game to fill some time.

Buccaneer (or Seerauber which is the German version that I played) is a sharp little game. You start with numbered discs and you either build a crew (by putting your disc on someone else's disc or their stack of discs) or takeover a ship (by committing a stack of your discs to a ship that requires that many discs or fewer). There are three ships out each round, with variable amounts of money, and you have to pay out that amount to your crew based on their numbers. So you'll be giving away some of the bounty to whoever has discs in your stack. You pay out other players first and make up the difference from your private stack. Each player also has one "?" disc which varies in worth according to which ship it is used to take over. There's also bonus treasures for the first (and possibly second) disc in a stack.

You keep playing a round until all the ships are taken, then three new ones come out. The game last five rounds (or 15 ships). The nasty bit is that as your crew gets committed to stacks, you could end up in a situation where you are left with a big stack of discs and ships that payout a small amount, which would mean you'll lose money. But the alternative, creating a mega-stack of discs may only be pushing the problem further down the line and making it worse to boot.

Interesting game.  Open exchanges drive access to items and victory.  The theme is done adequately. Everybody seems to have fun with this.  I'll play it when suggested. Kind of cool stacking mechanic to gain adequate strength to take over a ship. We've played quite a bit of this and I hope to continue.

RATING: 6
Original game with simple enough rules to be played by my 8 year old son. The risk taking aspect is nicely done - it is good to get a big pile of pirates in front of you, but you will still need a worthwile ship to enter or you will have to pay more in salary than you can possible earn. Makes for some pretty nasty game opportunities. Components are great, even though the artwork is pretty unimaginative.

1st impression: Interesting new mechanic (for me, at least). Feels quite random despite the almost perfect infomation - I suspect the main mechanic is actually negotiation and alliances rather than more obvious chip-stacking.

My first and only play was entertaining, but there just doesn't seem to be enough there to sustain interest with repeat plays. I feel that the game would get monotonous very quickly. Unique and interesting concept, but a one trick pony for sure.

The mechanisms of the game intrigue me enough to give it my standard "I like it" 6, but I can see the rating going up with future plays.  The randomness of the card draws can make some plans worthless if a card you need is taken, but isn't replaced with a comparable card.  Still, it leaves room for strategy.

I think, it is pretty underrated game. It is light to explain, but has more depth I think, you can choose different strategies. We play with our 8 years old daughter and it is one of our favourites, we truly like it. I would even love to play it with my husband in case it could be played two. In case you have kids, I would highly recommend it, it is good fun with family.

Overlooked gem plays with wooden discs and takes advantage in game play that you can only see face of top disk but can see side colour of other discs in the stack.

Similar concept to card game loot but components of this game definitely make it more interesting than cards.

To take one of the ship cards, you have to have a stack of pirate chips, the minimum number needed for each ship being shown on the card. On your turn, you can take one of your chips, or one of your stacks, and put it on top of one chip or stack of another player, and are then the proud owner of the entire stack. Trouble is, you can't SPEND the stack on a ship until your next turn, by which time somebody else may have taken it away from you by the same process.

Another game I'm not quite sure what to make of.  I like the pirate theme but maybe it wasn't "piratey" enough.  Plays quickly and some strategy, lightly fun, but not enough to wow me.  Stack, stack, stack, score.  Stack, stack, stack, score.  Should at least play one more time.  If that doesn't work, maybe we'll add a little booze to the mix.

The game seems to be all about timing, which unfortunately is dependent on what others choose to do rather than your own smart choices.

I've also learned that most pirate-wannabees have a better memory than I do.

Worth a play, even so.

Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). A rather enjoyable game, even if there isn't necessarily much control. Still, it works quite well, if you are ready to accept some randomness.

it(Trade Interest: medium) it's pretty chaotic, and is definitely better with more people.  The whole things also depends on remembering which pirates are in which stack.  fun, in a quick and lite sort of way.  i don't feel much like a pirate when playing.

Plays fairly quick with very little strategic depth besides to acquire low value pirates from your opponents for the stack(s) you eventually want to board with.  What I would do late in the game is to make sure you are at least the first mate in larger stack(s) so that you will always receive a booty.  The other thing I noticed is almost no one ever calls mutiny, maybe people just plain forgot about the option to.

Interesting game disguised as a kid's game - but it's pure math! The trackable "hidden" information bugs me a bit in this one. If you count all the pirates played and always calculate when you get a reward for still "investing" this one becomes a brain-burner but obvious to play.

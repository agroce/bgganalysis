Best dexterity game I own, and I love dexterity games.  This one has charm and theme and tons of variety.  Superb!

Cute concept, but difficulty didn't seem to scale well. 'Easy' routes were absurdly easy, and more difficult routes required the mastery of just one or two discrete tricks. Once you could do the trick, it was easy. If you couldn't, it was impossible.

Looks nice on the table.

Super unique dexterity game, with challenges that really range for easy to super difficult. A keeper for sure, and my daughter loves it.

This is the kind of dexterity game I always wanted to have. Easy enough to play with the Kids(5&7) and still challenging and fun with my gaming Group!

it's a game with a bunch of dexterity mini-games using courses made from wooden blocks... how could you not like this game?

I don't really care for the board and owl part of the game, but the dexterity part is a lot of fun. For this reason, although I haven't tried the coop game yet, I expect I'll enjoy it more than the competitive version.

As expected, the coop game was a lot of fun. I really enjoy this game!

A very cute and unique scenario-based dexterity game.  

Players construct scenarios out of blocks, and then must navigate an adventurer and/or bear through the blocks using a hook that loops onto an eyelet on the adventurer and bear pawns.  Sometimes you'll just need to move around without knocking things over, other times you might have to use the adventurer to shove things to certain locations, etc.

The scenarios range from very easy and not very interesting, all the way to extremely hard and really cool, so there's difficulty levels for everyone.

My only hesitation is that there may be a novelty to it that wears out once you play it more and have explored the various scenarios, but it's definitely a fun game out of the box!

A very entertaining dexterity mini game smorgasbord. Really fun for everyone that has played it. Scoring seems odd for the actual game, but that is not really the fun of the game

Beautiful components that starts off too easy, but recently got the expansion for this and I should really spend some time playing it.

How much fun can you have with some blocks of wood, sticks, a piece of string and a disc? A lot is the answer. This cleverly thought out dexterity game of building obstacle courses and then trying to move pieces over or through them is great entertainment. And for those who find it too easy (unlikely) there are even harder challenges.

Dexterity puzzles are fun but scoring seems to be arbitrary. May change rating if I find we were scoring incorrectly.

Dex game that is a hard one to locate. Set up the challenge and complete said challenge to get owl points! First one up the mountain wins! It is super cute game and if you are bad at balancing and being steady - it might be a hard game for you. I would gladly play this one again. I think it runs long for what it is but I can see why people would want to acquire it! IMO not worth $125 going rate.

Nice material. Good idea. As I started to try the solo trip, my childs (5 and 8) stopped me for joining the game. Looking at the game makes you wanting to play it. If you manage a card you take the next. If you fail you want to try again, again, again...

A dexterity game about mountain climbing, with nice wooden bits - a kids' game really IMO. A bit too simple and unchallenging to be entertaining for any length of time, though the ability to play either competitive or co-op is a big plus.

I like what it's trying to do, but (as is too often the case with projects like this) not much attention seems to have been paid to anything except the core of the game. Everyone found the random points and the weird rules - e.g., why does exactly one player have to pay points to switch the route after each new route? - uninspiring, and you just spend too long watching other people manipulate the pieces.

I suspect it really shines as a solitaire game.

I'm someone who loves the idea of dexterity games, but more often than not I'm disappointed with the reality. Blocky Mountains was the exception. A little fearful about replayability, but I paid for a lot of extras so I think there's a lot of gameplay in this box of blocks. Seriously, one of the best dexterity games I've ever played

Excellent, suspenseful, risk-taking dexterity game. It looks so easy… until you try it. This game is so fun! Even the Level 1 cards start to get challenging. Level 1A routes are pretty much training levels, but even 1B get tricky. Some of 1C require a steady hand — or two independent steady hands!

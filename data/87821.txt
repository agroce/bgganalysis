Very simple (just make sure you're using the 2.0 version of the rulebook) but a lot of great things going on with this game.  Definite "Euro" feel with the cubes, but an enjoyable experience.  Mileage varies on a few of the Fortune Cards, brings it down about .5 for me.  Like it very much!

I was definitely disappointed with this game.  I really like Revolution by the same designer.  For me, there just wasn't enough that was novel here.  The experience seemed rather lifeless.  What about this game is unique or particularly fun?

Also, there were a few rules issues.  What is an "occupied space"?  A place where there's a building or pawn?  A place where there's presently a pawn?  Or, wherever there was a pawn during the current round (this is a significant issue, since players before you may remove their pawns from the board before you take your turn)?

RATING: 5
This is a decent game. The theme may have Biblical roots, but it's not a religious game in any way, shape or form. It's easy, breezy, forgiving worker placement, with some interesting and varied elements and potential strategies. You can plan ahead and try to out-think your opponents, or play more casually and just go for the obvious points (and focus your mind at crucial junctures in the game). 

A couple of issues: first, the market seems as if it will be relatively idle until the last turn of the game; it might be worth it to sell an extra gold or two, but not wood or food, for example. The priest might be overpowered; perhaps 15 points at game end would work better than 20?

Also, the components are on the cheap side; the turn order, scoring and building markers are the tiniest I've ever seen. Finally, the board could be slightly larger so it would fit inside the box properly and not slide around.

Great worker placement, euro style game, though it's by no means one you can usually break out at church gatherings, because it IS a Euro and will take some thoughtful folks to understand how to play (and play well). 

Was the best of the "Christian" games so far, though. Now eclipsed by Kings of Israel.

An engaging and interesting worker placement game with enough different twists to set it apart from the crowd.

 There are various ways to get points; buying and selling in the market, constructing the temple, building buildings, acquiring fortune cards and controlling the High Priest among others. The strategies dictated to acquire the victory points are different every game depending on the buildings available and the paths chosen by your opponents. Don't underestimate the fortune cards! 

  The theme is mostly pasted on; although the art does invoke the time period. It was the excellent design and interactive gameplay that really struck a chord with me and left me excited to bring this one to the table again.

 On a minor point, some of the components leave something to be desired. The buildings, for example, are ridiculously tiny. There was an upgrade kit that was made available by the publisher that fixed this issue, but unfortunately, it is no longer available.

Very good worker placement, engine-building game with higher-than-average player interaction. Everything is nicely integrated and makes sense. There are different strategies and ways to win the game. I don't like that the game can end pretty fast, on 3 different conditions, that is. It should have been a little longer. It's a shame that this game only got such a small-time publisher. The "artwork" is not so great and leaves an unfinished impression. The rulebook needs clarification.

Worker placement, resource gathering and building for VPs in the same vein as Pillars of the Earth, all integrated very well with the theme of building Solomon's Temple and vying for control of the High Priest.

There are several very nice twists on worker placement in this game. I very much like how the available spaces on the board change (becoming inaccessible to some, merged to others) as a result of player action.

There's something about the way that buildings come out (no ability to see what's coming) that rubs me a little wrong when combined with: (a) the way turn order changes; (b) the difficulty in accumulating sufficient resources to be guaranteed a build if not building first or second; and (c) the critical nature of buildings (VPs, a private action, and a reserved action space on the board from which you can build roads). Perhaps if the next N buildings to be available were public information? Not sure.

(Also, in certain circumstances there's active incentive for players to create infinite loops in the market so they can stay in just in case an opponent sells something of use to them. Easily avoidable via either "can't buy what you already sold" and/or "can't sell what you've already bought", though.)

Enjoy this game, but I am not sure about the market. Based on personal experience, a player who is willing to "play the market" (which is contrary to the spirit of the game, IMHO) will win more often than lose. My rating would be higher if it weren't for this shortcoming. I would like to try a variant that addresses this, perhaps where goods are sold at market for 1/2 price or where the price drops more precipitously.

Impressive worker placement game, interesting turn order mechanism, and refreshing and good theme.  Very good game, a step above Stone Age in weight perhaps.  See my pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/766112

The original rules are sketchy in a couple of places, but are easy to learn, and the FAQ should address all questions:

There's also an [filepage=77065]updated rules manual[/filepage] which clarifies things nicely.

Also owned: 
[thing=116599][/thing]
[thing=142983][/thing]

Seems best with 3-4 players with just the base game.  A print-on-demand expansion is available for 2-3 player games, and especially makes the 2 player game very good: [gameid=142983]

Also try this variant (now official) for 2-3 player games: [thread=749479][/thread]

[imageid=1919923 medium inline]

Some lingering concerns: turn order determines winner, as a result of impoverished resources and limited building choices for player who is last?

I got off to a rocky start with KoS as I found the rulebook to be poorly implemented, and in one critical case, the wording on the board differs from the wording in the rules. Our first two plays were lackluster, and with the poor rules and lackluster components, the game seemed like a Kickstarter failure. After clearing up some rules in the forums, I'm happy to find that the correct implementation of them makes the game much better (hey, imagine that).  

KoS offers an interesting and interactive take on the worker placement genre with a lot of tempting decisions and ways to squirm your way into finding points. You place workers in either resource or action spaces. After all players have placed, you resolve those spaces player by player a la Stone Age. The decisions are quite interesting as far as placement in resource spaces or actions spaces, capped by the three super bonus spaces that offer big payoffs but you have to place all your remaining workers there when you take it. 

The game seems a bit rough around the edges and that it could've used some more development. For example, the market is frequently ignored till later in the game, the buildings don't seem to have enough variety, and the fortune cards are wildly imbalanced. I might recommend taking out the interactive ones as they are so much more powerful vs the "get 1 resource or VP" cards. All in all, it's a reasonably good medium weight w-p game.

Edit: I ended up getting rid of the game as part of an initiative to only keep games I'm very excited about. KoS didn't rise to that level for the reasons stated in the last paragraph.

Apart from the rulebook quite forgetting to tell us many of the actual rules (easily fixed by FAQ) it is a very good worker placement games.  There are some clever ideas for changing the nature of the game as the economy develops and managing the demand for workers.  However it is very hard to claw back a player who gets a good early lead.  Has some good insight into the historical situation of Solomon's Israel too.

Kingdom of Solomon is a solid but rather ordinary worker placement game. Send your minions out to harvest resources, and use those resources to score points or improve your engine for later turns.

There is only one thing that sets it slightly apart from most of the competition but I'm not convinced that it does so in a good way. The thief action space allows directly targeting certain players, and since some resources are rather rare losing a cube this way can be huge. The fortune cards include equally or even more devastating options. If you always wanted a worker placement game with a little more direct interaction this may be it. If you didn't you can probably find better options elsewhere.

A fairly rudimentary worker placement. Players race to construct buildings in order to take control of the most important resource regions. Players who fall behind in this race attempt to take control of the high priest who can commandeer another player's resource region.
In the mean time, constant games of chicken occur between committing to particular resources for limited building options and the literal powerful chicken spaces that require all remaining workers to be placed upon them.

Unfortunately the game is fairly static even with different buildings drawn each game as resource regions are of such fixed value (namely: control of Aram and Amalek are important to maximize Gold potentiality).
The high priest also provides very little consolation to a losing player, as they will have poured many resources in attempting to control it but gains practically nothing when another player wins that race.

The history of the Israeli people is rich, dramatic, tragic and fascinating.  Not only does it make for scintillating study, but it seems ideal as the subject for board games.  Sadly, most of the few attempts made at producing a board game using this theme have been an attempt to appeal to a religious-minded market, which is not in itself a bad thing.  However, the games have generally been woeful.  

Fortunately, Kingdom of Solomon by designer Philip duBarry and publisher Minion Games is an exception.  Set in Israel in the time of King Solomon, the game challenges players to collect resources, which they will use to construct various buildings, including the legendary Temple of Solomon.  It is a clever worker-placement game that requires proper timing and the ability to beat your opponents to coveted locations.  There is nothing startlingly new here, but everything blends together well to create a challenging and tense game.

Kingdom of Solomon doesn’t break much new ground within the worker-placement genre.  For the most part, what is here has been done before in other games.  Still, it does combine the various mechanisms and elements quite well and in an underutilized setting.  There is a palpable tenseness to the proceedings, particularly during the placement phase.  A player has so much he wants to accomplish on his turn, yet waiting too long to secure a coveted location could well cause that space to be claimed by an opponent.  Yet, unlike in other games, losing a coveted space is rarely disastrous.  There are other viable options.  It is how well a player performs with those options that will likely spell the difference between victory and defeat.

An uncomplicated worker placement game with simpler options than usual for the genre. There are no accumulating piles of resources to tempt you from your intended course of action as in Agricola or Le Havre for instance. Some question over whether the buildings represent 'value for money' when you can convert your cubes to vp at a better rate in the marketplace. I don't normally do well at this type of game, but found this quite approachable, an illustration of the simplicity on offer.

Interacción por encima de la media. CONS: Ser el Sumo Sacerdote parece descompensado (efecto "el rico se hace más rico"). Todas las cartas parecen normales menos una claramente descompensadora.

This is a quality game that is much like Caylus so far as style of game, but better in my opinion. I have both Caylus and Kingdom of Solomon. ((( Correction I use to have Caylus, and I have off loaded Caylus because my friends and myself have found this so much better )))

If people who rate both Caylus and Kingdom of Solomon rate Caylus as higher, then it is probably the dislike of the Bible theme. The lower rating, however, may also be due to the graphics. 

It only loses out in that mainly strategy game players will get into the game.

However, if a non-Christian has any notion that the Kingdom of Solomon is within the Bible it may inherently bring up the idea that, "if  I do not believe I am not heading in the right direction". Many do not like this type of conviction. For some non-Christian people this conviction is a part of all Biblically themed games, even if they do not need to know anything about the Bible as in Kingdom of Solomon. However, the Bible theme does not have any noticeable effect on game play. 

My friends and I really enjoy the game and accept the Christian theme without any difficulties. This game deserves a much higher rating than the average Geek rating imho, at least as high as Caylus.

RATING: 5
Typical small publisher effort with lots of enthusiasm, a few new ideas, original details and a noticeable lack of polish and need for additional development. On top, it's a distinguishably American approach to the Euro genre of worker placement.
Mainly two elements annoy me:
1. The lack of balance 
If you do your math correctly, it's often best not to get caught in the main part of the game to construct buildings or the Temple of Solomon and instead just gather as much resources and fortune cards as possible to convert them directly to VPs via the market. I doubt that the various buildings are priced comparably to their potential power and the value of placement spots or fortune cards varies wildly as well which is fine if you know the game but has the potential to throw some players off rails.
2. Ameritrashy elements of targeted direct interaction
KoS is very calculation heavy. It doesn't fit that the most efficient player will be subject to direct targetting (resource theft etc.) levelling out almost any good play. 
But as mentioned above, there are some positive aspects as well. It's a good idea that there are some very powerful spots that can be chosen by placing all remaining pawns at once introducing a "game of chicken". The graphics are unique, I really like the style and theme is almost tangible.
In sum, KoS is probably a recommendable game for crossover gamers but for classic German gamers like me it's average at best.

A perfectly cromulent game, which is a shame. I like the historical/religious theme, but the artwork is boring and the game play is generic, derivative and lacking excitement.

Looks cheap, but there's a decent game in there. Thanks to fortune cards it's a bit random and the functioning of the high priest and the market are a bit lacking. There's a slight feeling that the game is a mixture of really nice mechanisms, but suffers from some rough edges.

This is a game where once you start falling behind, it's hard to keep up. And I fell behind badly. At the end, it just turned into seeing if I could help the second player beat the runaway lead of the first player. Runaway leaders and lack of chance to catch up...not a great experience. It might be a better game on replay assuming the one card that granted one player the ability to run away with a lead doesn't come up early, but I still felt a little soured on this one. I'd give it another shot though.

The rating is for 3-p games. The game with two players is not as good, the Market phase is not as useful, since there are resources enough for the two players.
In all my games the player with the High Priest lost, so this is not an unbalanced game in my experience.
Nice medium euro, well themed. Rulebook could improve.

Not-bad worker placement game with at least one nifty idea: spaces where you place all your remaining workers, ending your turn. Wait long enough and you can get them for cheaper, but if you wait too long, someone may beat you to them. I also liked the roads with allow you to grab from other spaces as well, but also allowed that other space to grab from you. Beyond that the game is not bad, and plays at a pretty good clip, but it's about the same weight and style as Lords of Waterdeep, and frankly I'd just rather play that.

Timing is a big deal in this title. You need to try and determine how badly you want something or if its OK to give an opponent a chance to snatch it away from you. Usually it's not OK and there's not much you can do about it.

Worker placement meets building activation and all in a relatively short run time. The game is just sufficiently different from other games and faster for me to choose to play it again. Due to the rapid build towards a finish, there is little time to build up a point scoring engine which is a good thing if you are looking for a quick game.
I am looking forward to my next game.

Solid worker placement game with a good length-to-depth ratio.  Occasionally you will have absurd situations in the market phase where nobody wants to drop out and the same cubes keep getting shuffled around.  The "all of your remaining workers" action spaces are an excellent idea that add considerable pressure to what looks like a fairly ho-hum game at first glance.

This is just another worker placement game, but it had a twist that makes me want to try it again. I liked the Fortune Card, Turn Order, and Tribute spaces that you have to spend ALL your remaining workers on. This made it a fun game of chicken how long you could last. The rules were so/so, but quick to get into, however I did spend quite a bit of time on BGG during the game looking for clarifications.

RATING: 5
There is a nice idea here but the game is seriously underdeveloped and unbalanced.

The event card deck isn't very convincing: One card is a total game-breaker, and the rest of the cards could use some balancing as well. In its current form, the game is heavily tipped in favor of excessive and lucky card drawing.

The market seems underutilized. In our game, its main use was just dumping the excess resources when the game was about to end.

The building cards look like they are from a finished product but the game board looks like a cheap, unthematic prototype with all the generic textboxes. There's not enough room for the cards on the board, either. The color scheme is also bad: For example, the orange cubes are shown as red on the board and cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is either a very balanced game or a very unbalanced one; and, yes, I know all the arguments for saying that they are one and the same thing. I like the explosion of game pace that results from the buildings and regions; something you don't usually get in worker placement, but the thief action space and fortune cards are big spoilers. I can't shake the conviction that going for an early stone strategy is just too powerful.

Sure, it's another worker placement to earn cubes which are used to buy things, but this does a lot of things right. I really like the tension around how long to stay in, as they first guys to pull out of the placement round get big bonuses - do you risk placing one more guy or pull out now? There's some limited interaction with cube stealing, enough to make the spot useful and potentially make a difference, but not enough to be break it. There are fortune cards you can draw as a make-up if you didn't get into the places (and get the cubes) you wanted. Convert cubes into buildings - these earn VPs but also provide a new action space for your personal use, which frees the board up. Only the board is getting tighter because spaces start merging when people build roads between them - a lovely balance. And it comes in at the right time-frame as well for this genre. All in all, a very decent game.

I don't know why people laud this game for having a religious theme; the theme seemed totally tacked-on to me.  This is your typical turn-cubes-into-victory-points game.  This can be done either by buildings (which also give you special abilities), by building the temple, or by selling them in the market (where people can buy them for points too).  Getting cubes was achieved by a worker placement mechanism; clever play will let you get more cubes with your workers.  That's about it, folks.  While I don't see anything that bad about the game, it was very dry and didn't really have anything special.

RATING: 5
I hate to pick on the superficial, but it's an ugly production with extremely poor information design -- lots of text tiny print around the board. The components sans "upgrade pack" are unnecessarily skimpy, too.

Mechanically it works somewhat better: purchasing buildings also locks spaces on the board to that player's use, and multiple spaces can be connected by roads to double-up on placement effects. There's also a cute market mechanism reminiscent of Glen More. The dual use of money as points works well.

There's no theme to speak of, however, and there are just so many different spaces for workers that nothing feels particularly tight -- except for turn order, which is critical for building. There's a massive advantage to becoming high prist first, and the fate cards, while powerful, can be irritatingly random.

Ugly and clumsy, then, with a few interesting ideas. At least it plays fast.

Worker placement game set in ancient Israel. On each turn you have to decide where to place your pawns on the board, either onto areas on the map resulting in you obtaining that region's resources, or onto various action spaces that introduce options such as claiming first place in the turn order, drawing fortune cards (which randomly provide you with resources or victory points), or directly obtaining five victory points etc. Once this is done you can use your resources to construct buildings in regions and thereafter roads connecting regions to increase their size and resource yield. This is followed by the construction of parts of the temple, again using resources and this leads to victory points or the option to attempt to become the high priest, which allows you place your pawns in areas already claimed by other players making the game much easier. There are a lot of strategic decisions facing players on each turn and the main one revolves around directly going for victory points or attempting to control areas on the map thus making the game easier as it progresses. The mechanisms come together reasonably well in 'KoS' and for a worker placement game it actually feels quite fresh, although there are several games out there that do this sort of thing better e.g. 'Le Havre', 'Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar', 'Antiquity' etc.

Wife lost brutally and now it is for trade :(

Smooth, smooth, smooth... I have never picked up a game of this depth and started playing in such a short amount of time.  I find this a deeply enjoyable game on many levels.  It's one of the smoothest worker placement games I've seen.  It has rich historical and religious themes and the cards are beautifully illustrated.  It's the best Biblically based game I have played and I have looked for years.  It was very very easy to learn.  I found the rulebook fluid and uncomplicated.  The only downside was the artwork.  Come on, put pupils in the eyes.  And the board is dreadfully dull and uninspired.  Otherwise, my wife and I have found this very enjoyable for an hour's game.

This is a fairly unknown worker placement game that happens to possess a Biblical theme. Unlike most games with such themes, the mechanics and gameplay in Kingdom of Solomon are extremely well done and make for an engaging and satisfying gaming experience. Kingdoms of Solomon was fortunate enough to receive the Ender treatment. You can find his excellent review [geekurl=/thread/766112/enders-comprehensive-pictorial-overview-successful]here[/geekurl]. He does the game far more justice than I ever could.

I identify primarily as a Eurogamer who enjoys games predicated on optimization, efficiency, and strategic planning, and this game is a ton of fun for me. If you enjoy other worker placement euro games such as Glen More, Viticulture, The Manhattan Project, Myrmes, Coal Baron, El Gaucho, or Rialto, you will enjoy this one as well. I have played all of the above titles and rank them all 8 or higher on the BGG scale. A detailed session report outlining my first experience with Kingdoms of Solomon can be found [geekurl=/play/details/17276625]here[/geekurl].

The gameplay integrates with the theme extremely well. At the 2P count, the back-and-forth cat and mouse aspect makes for some quite enjoyable tension. Indeed, with two players the game feels quite like a chess match, albeit with a much more enjoyable theme and flavor. Some of the mechanisms remind me a bit of Settlers of Catan, such as laying claim to resource spaces which generate resources, constructing roads to form regions, and the High Priest ability, which reminded me in some ways of the Robber Baron. However, KoS provides a far superior experience to any I have had with Settlers, as the random element of resource generation inherent to Settlers was absent, making this a far more strategic experience. Indeed, the game feels both refined and elegant. 

The rulebook is quite concise, and, with the exception of a few questions regarding the High Priest ability and road construction, it addressed every question we had during gameplay. With 4P, I think the experience would be a bit more chaotic, as resources would be harder to come by, resource shortages would likely be common, and choice buildings would likely be difficult to construct. 

It appears that there should actually be 16 Temple tokens rather than 10. Per [geekurl=/thread/696211/temple-gets-tweaked]this thread[/geekurl], [geekurl=/thread/716690/temple-tokens-10-or-16]this thread[/geekurl], and [geekurl=/thread/794932/kingdom-solomon-upgrade-kit-are-additional-high-pr]this thread[/geekurl], the Temple initially consisted of only 10 blocks, but was increased to 16 at the last minute. Unfortunately, the component sheet of Temple tokens was not increased to match. A component upgrade kit with additional Temple tokens has been made available by the publisher, Minion Games.

This game hit all the right notes for me. There is an interesting resource allocation/claiming territory mechanism and a lot of interesting actions to distract/confuse you. Deciding when to go for the uber-actions and forgo anything else for the round is a really interesting question.

Every round there will be buildings available to build which cost different resources, give different VPs, and have different special abilities.  Buildings let you place a marker on a spot on the board, making it unavailable to other players.

Take turns allocating pawns on the board, which has a variety of resource generating spaces, some clearly better than others.  

Some special spots on the board grant special abilities, steal a resource from another player, produce an extra resource that you already are getting, convert a resource to something else, take 5 VPs, or take a wild card which could grant a couple of resources or VPs.

There are also uber-special spots... Get three wild cards, take one of every resource, or change the turn order which gives more VPs the further behind in turn order you are. But these spots require you to commit all your remaining pawns.

The decision of when do you claim the uber-spot is a hard one.  You'll want to do other things, but wait too long and someone else gets them.

After pawn allocation you collect resources and then there is a market where cubes can be bought and sold for VPs.  But if the market is empty you can't buy and if the market is full you can't sell.  So it's tricky to know when it's better to sell a good for high VPs but let someone else have the resource he needs to build a building.  

Additionally you can build roads which improve resource gathering for some spots or the temple which gives VPs or you can forgo the VPs to try and be one high priest which gives the right to occupy 1 of your enemies' resource spots, and 20 points if you can hold the office at game end.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/87821/kingdom-of-solomon]Kingdom of Solomon[/url] is a solid work placement that plays fast, has a good range of tatical and strategic decisions, all wrapped up in a playtime of about 1 hour.

The game has a mixture of work placement and area control (when you take an area, only you can pu workers there, well, you and the High Priest, so isn't like there will be dispute for the area once it is taken). The resources are then used for three things: to build roads (that connect areas - so with only one worker, you can get the resources of both areas), to build the temple (this can earn victory points or tokens - the player with the most tokens is the High Priest, that worth points in the end game and also allows the player to use areas of other players) or to buy/build buildings, that are worth points and also became a bonus area for you to put your workers (no one else can use your buildings).

As with any good work placement, timming the place to put the workers is key: there are a few really good spots, but if you put a worker there, it is the last one you will put in that round. So you want to go there, but not to soon. This creates a nice level of tension in the game.

As I said before, it plays in about one hour, being on the light-medium side of work placements.

King Solomon presided over a golden age of peace and prosperity in ancient Israel. During this time Solomon instituted an unprecedented building program. As one of Solomon's chief governors, you must procure materials and oversee construction of buildings and roads across the land for the glory of Solomon. You will also help to construct the Temple, one of the wonders of the ancient world.

Kingdom of Solomon is a worker-placement game with a few new twists and turns. Do you claim a resource space, an action space or throw in all your remaining pawns to grab a powerful Bonus Space? Will you spend your resources to extend Solomon's kingdom, take some points in the Market or add to the Temple? These and many other choices await you in this highly interactive game.

Worker placement in Ancient Israel to build the Kingdom of Solomon and a grand temple. Build your own buildings to claim soul benefit.

This is an interesting game that has resonance with [thing=18602][/thing] (opportunistically scarf up cubes to build buildings to create more opportunities for yourself and/or others).

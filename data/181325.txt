Simple number line game with some clever twists.  Heinz did a great job of adding some innovation into something that would be routine otherwise.  I like it a lot!  And now I have to find a copy...

「１９」のような天地逆にしても「６１」として使えるルールがオシャレなルールだなと思った。個人的な戦略パターンとして、裏面タイルの位置替えはゲーム終盤のここぞという時だけにしたほうが勝率良い気がする。基本は祈りながら取り敢えず引く！

This feels like a game from a different time; the type of game that your parents might have played with another couple for an evening. The game didn't really matter, it melted into the background and play became automatic, while the players could catch up and enjoy each other's company.

It feels a little like Mahjong, or Rummikub, though not nearly as thinky. Games are short, the winner almost doesn't matter, but you still feel highs and lows while you play. And when it's over, just push all the tiles into the middle, mix them up, and play again.

I can totally understand why Schmidt would publish this into their Classic Line. Though it's a new game, it feels like a new classic, and belongs in the same ling as Dog and others.

There is not a lot here for hardcore hobbyists, but it's an entertaining game that's incredibly easy to teach and has that "just one more game" quality.

Nice riff on Rack-O.  Quick filler that will work well to close game nights - like Finito currently does for us.

Want to try a pnp with my copy of 6 nimmt. The tiles are awfully cute though! Much easier to line up on a table too.

The interesting decisions don't come until near the end of the game when you're wondering whether it's worth it to spend a turn reserving a space in your row instead of drawing a tile. The mechanism of putting numbers in order has been done better by 20 Express and Qwinto and some other games.

Quick, easy to learn, good filler. But too luck based...

Very cool little filler with a bit depth, preferred towards Rummikub!

Played it with [thing=432][/thing] cards. 

I would like to give it a 7, it's quite a good filler...until the end game. I didn't notice that the rule-set is actually broken: that players can constantly swap face-down cards, expecting some others flipping new cards that do not fit, and the game is never ending, which, is actually the optimal strategy in most cases near the end game. This one rotten apple spoils the whole barrel.

Wish someone find a way to fix this. I am searching for a good fix, and if that is found, I would rate this higher.

There are a lot of Rack-O variants around, but this one is my favorite. The rules and components are extremely simple, but it moves very quickly and is fun to play. Is this really measurably better than the others? Maybe. There is still a ton of luck of the draw, but I think this one gets the balance right with short play time, nice components and overall fun factor.

A great game for any card playing family. I want to get this just for non-gamers. Place 17 face-down tiles in a horizontal line, draw 5 and then seed them in your 17 face-down tiles in the best fashion that will allow you to complete a 1-100 continuous ascending order. On your turn draw a tile and place it if you can or put it back in the middle. A different take on rummy for me. Still, luck of the tile drawing effects this one for certain and I can see most games just ending on that aspect.

I didn't expect much, but it turned out to be an enjoyable filler. Simple, quick, and intuitive.

Now we are talking! A BIG hit in my regular game group and an excellent choice for family table as well. Just a great example of simple design were there are only couple of rules, but still enough of game and skill play included (so it isn't totally luckfest). Great quality components too! Definitely keeper and one of those games, which you want to play couple of rounds straightaway - and that's something unusual  - at least in our group. I would even say, that Completto has even chance to win 'best family game' award if it just gets a wider audience around the world.

처음엔 혼자하면서 운이 좀 있어야하는 게임으로 생각했으나
나온 숫자, 위치별 가능 확률, 순번에 의한 Open 조정 등 견재 및 전략적 방법을 다양하게 사용할 수 있는 게임이다. 
이런 퍼즐 류를 좋아하는 편이다.

Delightfully simple. A rummy variant, and I've always enjoyed rummy games. Mellow, non-offensive, yet exciting enough. 

Suggest.

Essentially an improved Racko, with a little bit more control and a little bit more risk management. It's just enough to make the game feel fresh. Perfect for playing as a filler or as a social activity. Breezy and fun. A likely SdJ nominee?

A race to get 22 numbered tiles in ascending order. Taking a tile from the pool to replace one of your face down tiles or (occasionally) moving one of your face down tiles to a better spot. A few nice twists like some values being valid either way up (eg 81 or 18) + having an extra turn if you place next to an adjacent number. 

Luck of the draw plays a great part, of course, but paying attention to what's already been placed does give you the chance to mitigate the luck.

Looking for a few more easy for early groups. This looks up my alley since I like Racko.

Arrange number blocks in ascending order. You can estimate how likely some numbers are, but in the end it's mostly luck of the draw.

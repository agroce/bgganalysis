The next level of Kimble. The mechanic, trying to guess the number of grains inside the cone by listening the sound it makes, is, if nothing else, at least something rare.

A guess-the-metal balls in the cup game (along the lines of Igloo Pop). I am terrible at these games and have gotten completely decimated in my 2 games of this. I do appreciate the concept and there is more strategy in this one than in Igloo Pop.

RATING: 4
Fairly boring game of guessing how many beans are hidden in a shaker.  The best guessers will a greater number of spaces on the race track, and probably over-take the worst guessers (sending them back to start).  The game is not utter garbage... it's just a lot of guessing, which is not my idea of a good time.

Harder to tell which one has 2 and which has 12 than you'd think.  A game that is sure to attract attention from those not playing.  They are guaranteed to want to try too.

I prefer Igloo Pop, for an auditory betting game.

Zapp Zerapp, like most all the Zoch games, is a beautiful production. The kids liked it. But I think some of the theme is a little cumbersome and dissonant with the game play. Igloo Pop seems to just work a bit better and play faster.  However, I plan to own and keep both games.

RATING: 5
The is primarily a game for kids. Roll and move, but with an innovative mechanic in which players shake small containers to determine how many pellets are inside. The player whose guess is the closest to the number rolled on two dice, without going over, moves first. Landing on a space with another player allows the active player to banish him. The player that gets all three of her pawns to the end wins. I'm not really interested in playing it again, unless it's with children. My rating takes this into account.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this game a lot, which is odd since I'm not a fan of igloo pop.  The game needs a couple tweaks to reach its perfection, but the fact that you can still make progress while not being the closest is a big improvement.  Thanks Secret Santas 2008!!

delightfully funny game.  Reminiscent of Parchisi, but not so boring.  Parchisi:  roll, move, roll, move, maybe send someone back home.  Zapp Zerapp:  roll, shake lots of Madness Kegs, laugh, move or swear (depending on your keg).  I enjoyed it, and can easily see this as a wonderful, light, late night sort of game.  My husband hated it, he lost because his kegs were consistently one over the mark.

RATING: 7.1
A kids game that is a bit like Parcheesi but with an innovative movement and capture mechanism based upon the no. of lead weights in a sealed container. You shake it and guess. The game works for adults too and this game was shortlisted for Spiel des Jahres (2001) for the Children's category. (loaned to sheila regan)

Parcheesi, but you have to listen to your pawns.  I appreciate using an unusual sense for a board game, I just wish the rest of the game were better.

RATING: 5
This is a luck/guessing race game where the players shake some black plastic capsules to guess as to how many pieces are in the capsule. It's more complicated than that, but I'll refer you to the BGG for a full description. It seemed to be a good kid's game, but to light for our crowd. It might make a decent party game, particularly if alcohol is involved.

While I think the "equal or lower" condition is superior to Igloo Pop's "equal", something went wrong with the implementation of the board element. Progress is repeatedly undone and the whole thing gets tiresome very quickly. To be avoided unless you really like the shaking element.

Nice kids/family game. Ludo with a great unique "aural push your luck" twist. Not sure if this would stay fun if played often, though.
(Based on just one play.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game, wonderful for introducing people to boardgames. High silliness/giggling factor, though. Also, you need to glue in the saltshakers' lids, otherwise the pellets from inside are prone to fly off in all directions after a particularly vigorous shake.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent kids game which is also enjoyable for adults. Basically a Pachisi variant with a very nice twist. Movement is determined by selecting a small container holding a number of little balls and having that number match as closely as possible, but not exceed the result of a dice roll. The sound and weigth assessment of the different containers is a very neat and fun element!

Played a two player game with basic rules.
Not ideally but I can form a decent idea.
Made me think a lot of Igloo Pop. This is definately more suited for kids. If you play safe you can still move. And no elimination.
I like Igloo pop more because it is more frantic, but in time I see myself switching ratings between those two games.
There is certainly more depth to this game.

The gamerules,play and excellent components transform  a boring game [gameid=2136] a fun game to play.

RATING: 6
Silly and fun. Different from Igloo Pop on several fronts; there are some actual decisions/tactics in selecting which shaker to take on each round. In some circumstances, you can knowingly decide to bust or to aim low depending on the cirumstances on the board. However the game can last much longer than Igloo Pop, and in fact has a very indeterminate end game condition. I really like the idea, but it could have been applied to something other than a game of "sorry".

It takes Igloo Pop and turns it into a race game rather than a points game, your result being determined by your ability to best hear how many little balls there are in a shaker. Kinda fun for the family for a bit, but the mechanism wears out its welcome halfway through the game.

Interesting take on Parcheesi here - like the process of determining movement.  Our four player game was just the right length, coming to an end just as the game was about to start dragging.  The fact that all the players are involved in every turn is also a plus.  I've rated this with the idea that it is a game to play with adults and children -- for that crowd I think it's a great fit.

Well executed integration of listening with other game mechanics.  I like this better than other listening-based games, like igloo pop.

The game takes too long for what it is, bit that is easily fixed by playing to 1 instead of 3.

Ghastly game of Sorry where you only get to move if you can guess the weight of a salt cellar, the order of movement depends on your weight guessing skills, and you send an opponent home by passing them as well as landing on them. Apparently we played with a number of incorrect rules (you [i]can[/i] banish by landing on the same space; you [i]cannot[/i] banish when moving out of your home), and I suspect these exaggerated the frustrations. Maybe I‚Äôll try it again. [i]Maybe[/i].

Zoch dex games are great.  This is the next step.  It combines Sorry/Trouble/Parcheesi with a non-analytic skill (guessing count by weight or sound).  A great hooking device for non-gamers.

Although this game suffers from repetition, it really has some good depth to the shaking strategy (more so than Igloo Pop). This is true because the numbers also determine play order and the board is such that sometimes you want to move first (to distance yourself) and sometimes you want to move last (because the unit you want to capture isn't on the board yet).  Quite subtle...

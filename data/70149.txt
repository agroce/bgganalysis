O&L reminds me of Le Havre and Roads & Boats; it has a spatial component in terms of settlements (where as Le Havre only had the resource conversion) but it's abstracted away most of the logistics found in R&B. Roads & Boats takes me about 3.5 hrs and I find it takes about an hour too long, where as this routinely takes me around 3 and I have no issue with the length... Second, it has a more shallow resource conversion chain than R&B (going from logs to stocks takes around 8 buildings plus movements) where as O&L's complicated chains take around 4 or 5 actions/buildings.

Design-wise, it checks a lot of boxes that I like; wide decisions that I wrestle with (especially late game where there are upwards of 30 possible things I could do each turn). Opportunistic resource conversion and action taking, and some long term spatial planning with the settlements. If it had a randomized setup for buildings (e.g. a new expansion that you dealt in half of each game) then it would be a solid. The lack of a fixed end 8 rounds after D in 2p mode is sort of perplexing though and one of the few variants I employ if I have to play it 2p (although, I almost never do).

It also has a bunch of things that I actively dislike about euro games. It's a static setup/play, it doesn't have a lot of interaction (in fact, I've won games basically ignoring most of what other players are doing and instead only ensuring they can't buy the buildings I'm after), and while it is a sandbox of sorts, there are really only a couple patterns for building your settlements in and playing the game sometimes is just a matter of working on the margins of actions and the resource conversions (which are a minority of the point totals). This is true after 5-10 plays and everyone understands how the resources will convert and buildings are scored. It has a fiddly setup (like Bohnanza) where you change what's in the game and how the game is sort of played based on the player count.

I do think it's Uwe's best game, and I still think it's a 9, but it might be my weakest 9.

update: Almost 30 games in, I find I still really enjoy the game, and I think part of it is due to the spatial resource conversion element. One would think I would favor Roads & Boats more for that very reason, but I find R&B to be a fiddly puzzle, not necessarily a *game.* Neuland didn't do what I wanted, and Le Havre doesn't have the spatial piece. This sort of wins by default in that regard.

A combination of Le Havre, Farmers of the Moor, and new but very Rosenberg-like gameplay.

This game is essentially a worker placement point-grab fest, where you use your workers on your own board area, which you can develop and build up in a somewhat different manner each game.  Actions consist of: 1) grab resources by placing a worker in a building, 2) build a building, 3) grab resources (wood or peat) by clearing your forests or swamps on your play area.  Money can be used to purchase additional landscape tiles as a free action, and it can also be used to hire another player's workers to make them place in their own buildings to generate the resources for you, which can lead to some interesting blocking situations.  There are few ways to score points: 1) building settlements, which are built using food and energy and score points based on their connectivity to other buildings and settlements, 2) built buildings, which provide points, potential settlement points, and special abilities, 3) building wonders, which are like build point buildings with no special function, and 4) accumulating resources that have point values (such as whiskey, gold, etc.).  Unlike most of Rosenberg's games, there is no stress of a "harvest", however you do need to keep up with the neighbours building settlements otherwise you will likely be out the game with respect to points.

The game plays 1-4 players; I've played it 2 and 3 and it scales well, but its a long game and I can't see playing with 4 players.  There do not seem to be any replayability issues whatsoever despite what many BGGers are complaining about; that said, the game does seem like its ripe for expansions and I would certainly welcome expansions.  This is definitely a gamer's game, in line with Rosenberg's other big box games, and its probably his second or third best design for me.

Interesting. I need to get a session where all of the rules are right, but this has so many interesting decisions to make that it's hard to know which one is the best at the moment.

More plays will reveal more nuance, of this I'm sure. Right now, it's a very enjoyable game -- which should only get better over time.

3 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: Very long term strategic. I enjoy the resource wheel because it has a bit of push-your-luck to obtain that one extra resource from the wheel, hoping no one takes that wood! Nice spacial puzzle when placing settlements. Good game arc as resource demands change through the phases.

DISLIKE: Chit intensive. Low interaction, but the resource wheel is enough. Brain intensive, so some AP. First time players will not know all the card combos. Some strategies don't change from game to game, therefore if an optimal path is found, the game could get repetitive.

OVERALL: Similar to Le Havre, good game, but can be long. It's a lesser known title than the other Uwe Rosenberg titles. There are two sets of scenarios to keep the game fresh. I still prefer Le Havre, but will play this anytime.

RATING: 6
Based on one solo play.  Need to play it again to get a clearer opinion.

UPDATE : Played again 3p.  Agree with my original rating. It's another good design from Uwe.  Perhaps too many resource types and wide open options to score points.  Repeated plays are needed to have any chance to get a good score.

I doubt this one will stay in my collection. I think Le Harve is the best for me in this space of games. Ora has alot of fiddly parts to it somehow. And the cards just sprawl all over - making it incredibly difficult to see what your opponents are doing. I think if one loves Agricola and Le Harve and wants more of the same, then this is a winner. For me, I'll just stick with the other two.

RATING: 8.9
Muy buen juego de gestión de recursos, y de gestionar construcción de territorio con cartas de edificios, que hacen combo o transforman los recursos. La idea de la rueda es MARAVILLOSA y facilita y agiliza el juego. El detalle de poder pagar a otro monje por hacerle una acción suya le da un toque un poco más interactivo. Probado a 4 y a 2, escala muy bien. En mi opinión, en plan gestión de recursos, siguiendo la línea del autor, este juego supera al Agrícola, (si bien es cierto que el agrícola tiene una variedad brutal con los mazos de profesiones y adquisiciones)

RATING: 5
Basically this game suffers from the same bad design features that you normally encounter in Alea games, i.e., you need binoculars to see the cards. This is really annoying and creates an unnecessary steep learning curve.

I also felt that this time Mr. Rosenberg has gone over the top with the number of individual resources. In Le Havre you could still keep track of things but in Ora&Labora it felt just impossible at the first play.

Yes, I will play the game but won't buy it myself at this point. Ora&Labora just doesn't offer enough new ideas after Le Havre/Agricola.

The increased complexity of Le Havre, without the theme of Le Havre, which I always suspected would put J off. This, though, being similar to Agricola, may hit the spot. Plays great w/ two, from what I've read, and highly variable. Can't wait to play (but where to scratch out four hours...?).

RATING: 9.8
My favorite of the Rosenberg harvest series that I have played.  Certainly feels like a reimplementation of [I]Le Havre[/I] and, in my estimation, an improvement.  Glad to have purchased the 2015 reprint of this that comes with the upgraded [read: not substandard] components.

Very similar to [I]Le Havre[/I] with collecting resources on offer (which accumulate every round that they are not taken) and building buildings to convert/optimize those resources, but with the added twist that the buildings are being built on an [I]Agricola: Farmers of the Moor[/I] landscape (that is expandable to include mountains/coast/water, etc.), so a lot of planning goes into what types of terrain the buildings can be built on, how those buildings are arranged around settlements that are built at defined intervals, whilst maintaining flexibility to build the central religious (cloister) buildings (which have an orthogonal adjacency requirement).  The mechanism for placing workers and taking those workers back adds some very interesting decisions and tension (can't take them back until they are all placed, and one of them, the prior, has a special bonus that he can immediately be used to activate a building when it is built IF he is available), which is a nice change from the pressure of just trying to meet regular feeding requirements.

I don't agree with the criticisms of the game that focus on its lack of variable setup.  The buildings in the game come out in predefined groups, but this is not all that dissimilar from [I]Le Havre[/I] where one typically sees the Clay Mound, or the Cokery, or the Ironworks enter the game at roughly the same stages in the vast majority of games (true, [I]Le Havre[/I] does include a limited number of "Special Buildings" that change from game to game, but I've never seen a winning strategy built around them, partially because there are only one or two optimal paths to take in [I]Le Havre[/I]).  With both the Ireland and France variants in [I]Ora et Labora[/I] plus the seemingly much more varied paths to victory, plus the interesting scoring opportunities based on dwelling values, I think there is enough opportunity for different-feeling games--though it is true that unimaginative gamers may get trapped into doing the exact same thing every single game, if only because it is theoretically possible to do so.  

Theoretically the lack of variable setup means the solo game is "solvable," though I've found this one a harder nut to crack than say, solo [i]Caverna[/i].  Multiple players change up the dynamic enough that I'm not overly worried about multiplayer games falling into the trap of feeling overly similar.

unplayed - have heard good reviews but a lot of comparisons to Le Havre (which I think is broken because there is really only one viable strategy amongst the dozen or so options) and Merkator (which was nice enough but seemed too long with not really much to think about because the available contracts could change so easily),  hopefully this doesn't suffer the same fate.

I liked that there was no Agricola like food mechanism that would take half of time. This gave more free hands. Rondel system was convinient. I think this could be best with 2 players. After that playtime increases and also you can't keep track what others have as well.

+ Interesting and open-ended about how you choose to pursue your strategy; Very satisfying as you watch your parcel of land expand and become more profitable.

1st play: Uwe's missing link between Agricola/Le Havre and newer games like Glass Road and Caverna.  The system is a bit rougher here and there are an absurd amount of resource types to convert. The theme and presentation is solid and there is a ton of variety. Huge puzzle to decode, and with no people to struggle to feed you can focus on the wide open victory paths.

2nd play: I really enjoyed the 2nd play of this.  I started making harder resources (whiskey) and using other people's buildings a bit. I could see needing a few plays to really learn the buildings. The wheel makes between round upkeep a breeze, and is a stark contrast to the caver and refill phase. Glad I acquired this one, too bad there probably won't ever be an expansion for it.

Cool design with lots of interesting decisions for building up your territory for points and special actions. The resource wheel is neat and offers a unique and useful method of gauging resource availability over time.

One of the most annoying pitfalls is the poorly produced physical components (thin and cheap). The player aid is especially crucial to the design with its spreadsheet of necessary strategic information--but the graphic design is a mess. It looks like a huge excel spreadsheet with tiny font on a cheap piece of paper. I would easily rate OeL a bit higher if they could manage to produce it with reasonable quality.

Feels like work - problem is - without being paid. The theme would be interesting for me, but there are so many numbers, cards, chits (450..), symbols, too much for a stupid person like me. At least I learned that Agricola, Euphrat & Tigris require more wits than I got and I'll refuse such games from now on.
Of course I don't dare rating this game. I just hope Puerto Rico and Power Grid aren't as complicated b/c I'd really like to try them out.

I'm not too much a fan of Loyang, and I haven't bothered (so far) with Merkator, but this really was a great game. It did feel quite a bit like Le Havre, with just a touch of Farmers in the Moor. I think the work contracts are an interesting, if light, bit of interaction (though hiring an opponent's prior can ruin their plans). There is indeed a very wide decision space, including with landscapes and layout and everything else. It's also pretty satisfying to see your monastery at the end of a session.

I do still wish there were some variability. Not that the game needs it ... as I said the decision space is pretty huge ... but because it would potentially create interesting and different dynamics. As in, in certain sessions certain resources and buildings will be in particular demand. This is similar to the building arrangements in Le Havre. The wharf will come out at a different time each session, but you know when it will come out. Early wharf games will play very differently than late wharf games (or other buildings, but notably the wharf can affect the game dynamic most dramatically). I do find this sort of variability really refreshing.

I can understand that perhaps Uwe has tuned the game very specifically to this fixed setup and I think I'll like it just fine as it is. Do I like it more than Le Havre? Potentially. I can understand that people feel it's too similar to Le Havre, and I get some of that feeling myself. They play in maybe about the same time and have very similar game dynamics, but I could see playing either one. Le Havre feels much more rich with resources. Ora & Labora isn't tight, but doesn't blow up like Le Havre.

Do I like it better than Agricola? The setup in O&E is cumbersome, but not Agricola cumbersome. Really, Agricola's still great, though, with great great tension and great variability in the cards and such. All three are 10s, and I'm always up to play, if we have the time.

A fascinating game with tons of depth and a huge action tree. Takes and streamlines the best mechanisms of Agricola and specially Le Havre and adds a whole new dimension to these games by way of the spatial management of each player's town. In essence, it's an incredibly well crafted economic game: you'll be managing an economy from its humble, farming beginnings as it grows into a monster machine of churning out expensive crafts.

Those who are anguished by the perspective of feeding will also enjoy the fact that the 'feed' phases are cleverly disguised as another opportunity to grow (very profitably), and that you can plan on how much food/energy you will need well in advance.

This is a classic game and, for my tastes, the absolute best Uwe has to offer. A masterpiece.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Another great eurogame from Mr Rosenberg. The game feels a lot like Le Havre because of the many (10+) different resources that you can collect and later transform to another 10+ products. The rules are very simple and the 'meat' of this game is in the buildings. There are many of them each with unique abilities.

So what's new in Ora et Labora??

First of all I like that you now have your own land spaces where you can build things. The whole 'where to put each building in order to maximize the bonus points' problem feels like a small puzzle to me and I like solving puzzles. I also like the visual image of my monastery growing slowly turn after turn.  
The worker placement mechanic is also upgraded with each player having 3 workers one of them with a cool ability to imediately go and activate the building that you just bought. Also you can mess with other players by using their meeples on their buildings.
Oh and the big wheel that keeps track of the resources is simply genious!

The only negative is that the cards are small but to be honest it was neccasary in order to keep the playing area in logical dimensions.

I do want to play this more in theory, but not sure yet how often I will return to it. I like the jigsaw puzzle element of placing the Settlements. As in Le Havre in early plays, there's so much one can do it's hard to choose. HOWEVER-- the components are not good at all, e.g. the flimsy reference sheets, the tiny cards, the wheel that's hard to pull apart, and the tiles that were hard to punch! And the end condition in the 2p game seems odd. I also think it is quite long for what it is. Despite the many good aspects to the design, I somehow never find myself wanting to play it.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
If you like resource conversion, spatial reasoning, and worker placement, I have a hard time considering any game as an exemplar superior to Ora et Labora. Managing a mountain of lovely Klemens Franz-illustrated chits, start with a minuscule plot of land, three monks, and a few resources, then buy buildings, acquire real estate, pay off your opponents, harvest grapes, brew beer, create monastic relics, construct castles, shipping conglomerates, villages, wineries, palaces, and cloisters. 

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
The scale and scope. First off, this game will take up a TON of your table, which can be a negative for some. However, I consider the large scale to dovetail well with the large scope of the game, in which from very meager beginnings, you grow your player area not into a simple farmyard with some stables and fields, but a whole freaking diocese. I'm talking mountain ranges, coastlines, foothills, bogs, and forests, all populated with your buildings, settlements, and cloister. When I finish a game of Ora et Labora, I look over all that which I've created, and just gawk at it. It's huge. It tells such a great story. It feels like an accomplishment. In the same way, starting with a few sheep, a piece of wood, and a brick ends up eventually converting to monastic wonders, high-grade ironwork, illustrated libra, fine wine, and a whole host of other top-tier goods. 

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
There is a lot to keep track of, primarily the huge swath of chits you acquire which represent your goods. Not only do you need to order them sensibly to note how much you have of each type, but they are double-sided, meaning you can inadvertently mess up what you have with a nudge or flip.

Update: Another play - it's likely this will match with Agricola in my ratings.

Like Le Havre and Agricola it initially seems like there's an overwhelming amount of stuff going on, but again the key is looking for the few most lucrative connections and  developments then getting to them before your opponents. 

I like it better than Le Havre, not quite as much as Agricola, although there's potential my rating may change for the better (and possibly for the worse, but that feels less likely).

This game would be a 10 and maybe even top Agricola in the list of Uwe's big hits if it wasn't for the very scripted feel of each match.  This game begs for some kind of starting variables or mid-game mix ups.  We've tried a few variants but none are quite right.  It actually makes me mad because otherwise this is just an amazing game.

RATING: 7
This is a nice acquire resources and "buildings with cool effects," game with lots of different resources that can be upgraded/improved, and a multitude of engines that lead to victory points available for exploration and multiple plays.  

The worker placement aspect is relatively modest with some interesting, though seemingly small, twists that we only began to explore in our first game.  Am I sensing the possibility of cleverly timed screwage possibilities, or was it just my gaming imagination?

Like virtually every Uwe game, this game is thematically strong, and imbued with a loving devotion to thematic details.  Buildings "do" what their thematic place in the real world would suggest they do.  

Considering the recent profusion of, ahem, certain Feldian style games where the mechanics associated with buildings, resources, or spaces on the game board have essentially no inherent connection to the theme, or the the inherent thematic meaning of these items within the game, it may be time to give Uwe extra praise for his highly thematic designs, and buildings.

The game play is very resemblant of Le Havre. It revolves around using building most efficiently and gathering ressources at the right time. Some might say it actually is Le Havre without the feeding phase and with a ressource-rondel instead of ressource-spaces. In any case a great game! This could easily reach the top 20 of BGG.

Esta vez Uwe ha pinchado en hueso... al menos conmigo.

La vuelta de tuerca a su temática y mecánica habituales ha sido completamente fallida.

El rondel no aporta nada interesante, si cabe lo hace más farragoso todo. 

El setup realmente un dolor de muelas a la hora de buscar la combinación de partida corta/larga con el país y con el número de jugadores en tres manuales diferentes... saber que reglas aplican a esa combinación y cuales no hace que se te quiten las ganas de jugar antes de empezar.

La interacción entre jugadores es limitadísima, más que en ningún otro título suyo.

Los materiales son mediocres.

Tener todas las cartas de cada etapa disponibles a la vez, el ingente número de recursos diferentes y abrir la posibilidad de utilizar incluso edificios de tus oponentes no ayuda a tener un juego precisamente ágil. Más bien lo contrario... un absoluto despropósito.

Resulta repetitivo turno tras turno, intentando recolectar decenas de puntos y quemándote el cerebro intentando pensar cuál puede ser la mejor estrategia entre los cientos de combinaciones posibles...

Por mucho que trate de reinventar agrícola, no creo que le salga ninguno tan bueno como el primero.

Played 4P long game, 2P short game x2, and 3P long game.  Try as I may, I can't come up with a Eurogame that comes close on the 2P experience.  Agricola is my all-time favorite board game, and I only kinda like Le Havre.  I feel like this is a mature and FOTM-influenced Le Havre.  Didn't insta-buy a copy because of the well-known production issues, which I hope are resolved with a reprint.  With 25 turns, even a couple of minutes per turn per player can make this run extremely long with 3P and 4P.  I don't even mind it taking forever, but I do mind downtime.  Will check out the 3P and 4P short games.  Update: played a couple 2P games back-to-back and a bit of the shine wore off.  Ireland was a bit too forgiving for both of us, France had some serious point loops (wine for districts, then score districts) which made it so that only one player wanted to end the game while the other caught up.  And I'm growing a bit more concerned about the static starting positions.  Still, picked up the second printing and got a perfect copy.  And I'm still very happy to play it 2P.

Agricola has randomness in the distribution of occupation cards and minor improvements. This game does not have that randomness but has a seemingly endless possibility for combinations and strategy.

Another great design from Rosenberg, I love the theme of monks building up their diocese, the rondel for resources and upgrades works well to open the game up, and the actions are simple yet conceal a lot of depth. Assembling your player's region is fun with the additional boards, and the whole thing has a sense of elegance about it. The only issue is reversing those rondel dials for different player counts with an actual screwdriver, but that's minor and I'd advise when you open your box to place them both on the player count sides you'll most often use. Box includes both Irish and French play variants, so you can get a lot of longevity out of this edition.

RATING: 8
First impression was very positive, unlike the last couple of games from Uwe Rosenberg: good theme, interesting buildings, a good innovation in the product wheel, multiple and varied paths to play through the game, and it flowed pretty well (under two and a half hours for a first play with three, one a newbie and the other two inexperienced). In part it still featured the typical pressure on food through the settlements, but in a much more positive and subtle way; you can really play the game for fun, without the stress you're under in Agricola and Le Havre. I'm curious to see how it plays with two, and I have the feeling I'll end up preferring this over Le Havre.

Initial rating, based on playing once. There's a lot I like about this game, but wow, is it ever AP-inducing. Also really hard to keep an overview of which all buildings your opponents have. On the positive side, it seems to be balanced quite well, and my fear during playing for the first time, of wonders being necessary for winning, proved to be unfounded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Now with the updated 2015 printing, this game has components that match the high quality of gameplay. Like many Uwe Rosenberg's game, players are converting goods multiple times in order to score VP. But to do this, players use their workers (3 per player) to build/use buildings. But there is a catch, players only get their workers back if they place all of them. And one worker (the prior) can be used automatically when building a building. Thus, players attempt to place their workers efficiently by having them all placed before the end-of-the-round and only placing buildings when the prior is available. 

Compared to other Uwe Rosenberg's game, this game doesn't feel as confrontational/mean as Agricola. And because of the rondel mechanism, which gradually increases the number of basic goods/money per round, there always seems something worthwhile to grab. But this game isn't solitaire. Players are able to hire other players' workers and use their builders. And like most worker placement games, if a building is occupied, you can't use it. Thus, players have to contend not only with the race element (grabbing resources) but the prospect of other players' disruptive actions. 

There is more to this game. For instance, there is an abstract scoring element with how buildings are scored at the end of the game. But basically, if you like euro-games and you like resource conversion/management, this is a game you should strongly look at.

Amit előzetesen tudtam: A 2011-es esseniek közül a top3 játék, és amit sokat hallottam: Agricolába oltott Le Havre.

Ehhez képest szerintem ez tisztán a Le Havre továbbfejlesztése, de olyannyira nagy az átfedés (2/3-os kb.), hogy a pofátlanság határait súrolja szerintem, hogy más néven adták ki (simán lehetett volna Le Havre korongváltozat mondjuk...). Bár amennyi Steam-klónt kiadnak, ahhoz képest ez semmi, de akkor is: kétoldalas nyersanyaglapkák, az épületek mechanikája, de még a grafikai megoldások is (kaja jelölése) gátlástalanul az elődből merít: mentségére szolgál, hogy magától lopott a szerző:)

A játék egyébként szerintem jobb, mint a Le havre, de nem adok rá jobb pontszámot, a sok hasonlóság miatt. Miben jobb: kevésbé van elbonyolítva, kevésbé erőltetett, mint néhány dolog az elődjénél. Mondjam azt, hogy ez populárisabb? A korongon szinte minden infó rajta van, nincs szükség a nagy játéktáblára. Az épületek leépítési mechanizmusa még változatosabbá teszi az egészet. Az a fajta játék, ahol mindig mindenkinek jut valami, még ha bosszankodunk is azon, ha valaki elviszi az orrunk elől (vagy használja) a kiszemelt épületet. Mindig lehet menekülő út, alternatív megoldás, nehéz elképzelni, hogy nyerő stratégia lenne a játékban. A perjel nagyon tetszett, nemcsak a neve miatt. Hasonlóan az előd(ök)höz, itt is max. sejteni lehet, hogy ki áll jól, a végén érhetik meglepetések az embert.
Amit még kiemelnék, a két külön játékmód: ír/francia. Teljesen más épületek, némileg eltérő nyersanyagok.

A szabály bár nem rövid, nem is bonyolult szerintem. A játék szinte nyelvfüggetlen, ne riasszon senkit az angol, de még a német se! Játékidő szűk 3 óra volt nekünk 4 fővel. A minőséggel kapcsolatban voltak kritikák, de ha jól láttam ez orvosolva lett...

This makes a great solo puzzle. It will grow stale as a solo game after perhaps 10 plays, unless I develop a rules tweak.

The game is decent enough but it feels like the game is very one dimensional strategy wise.  It is just build build build buildings and it doesn't matter which kind.  Because of this the game just feels very flat and uninteresting.  Sure there is some clever play of when to use your opponents buildings to force them to use their prior but that's it.  The game has too many components detracts from the game as well.  I find it very fiddly because of that. With all that said, I would still play it.

I am afraid the strategy resembles very much le havre. Mechanics borrow a lot from farmers of the moor and le havre. However it is a very good resource management game, but I cannot advise le havre owners to buy it.

One of Uwe's playtesters made a comment about having played a game he felt was similar to Le Havre, but on steroids. That very comment was erroneously attached to Merkator before its release, and contributed heavily towards the crowds disappointment about that game.
Now, the game that was the rightful destination of that comment has come out. It is Ora et Labora.
And the thing that playtester said is SO TRUE: Uwe is finally back on track, with another masterpiece!

Ora et Labora has many things in common with Le Havre: very diversified paths to victory points, increasingly-powerful buildings becoming available during the game, the buildings being usable by every player, but at a cost when they belong to someone else.

There's lots of differences, also: no need to feed one's own people, no loans, a meaningful puzzle aspect in laying out the buildings (not to mention "the wheel": it can save many precious minutes of playtime!). I can't see a reason for not having both Le Havre and Ora et Labora inside the collection!

This is a game that will not storm BGG like Agricola and Le Havre did 4 years ago, but it is undeniably a game of the same caliber (I suspect it is the better one of the three) because the board game scene is more varied and frenzied now, and Ora et Labora is less innovative than games such as Eclipse.

But, after just three plays, I feel the need to play it again to explore its intricacies, and begin to master it. Let's go pray and work!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First Impression: This game relies heavily on the resource conversion mechanism. There's also a spatial awareness requirement to the game, as placing buildings beside other buildings create synnergies which score VPs. I particularly enjoy the simple decision of taking a resource that you require or a large accumulation of resources that may not be immediately useful to you. Also, the ability to use other people's buildings adds a level of interaction. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Game in the tradition of Agricola and Le Havre, but it's complexity is bigger and so harder to play. Lots of time is passing by with looking at cards of other players. No bad game for two players, but too long for more. Still a relief after Merkator

Die Kritik ist kurz: Lookout Games ist mittlerweile – spätestens seit Agricola – aus seinem Dornröschenschlaf erwacht. Die Spielertableaus sind von erbarmungswürdiger Dünne. Die Kartenqualität gegenüber den Agricola-Anfängen hat sich sehr gebessert, das wäre auch für die Spielertableaus sehr wünschenswert gewesen. Derart dünne Papptableaus sind für einen deutschen, etablierten Verlag nicht mehr zeitgemäß und stören durch ihre Wölbung teilweise auch im Spiel selbst. Auch fällt im Spiel auf, dass entweder die hölzernen, schön anzuschauenden Rohstoffmarker im Schnitt zu groß geraten sind, oder das Ertragsrad zu klein dafür ausfiel. Ansonsten ist Ora et Labora ein gelungenes Spiel und eine absolute Empfehlung für Freunde solcher Spiele.

Yet another strong title from Mr Rosenberg. I have played At the gates of Loyang, Le Havre , Caverna ,Agricola and this now. 
My preference:

1) Agricola 9/10
2) Le Havre 9/10
3) At the Gates of loyang 9/10
4) Caverna
5) Ora & Labora

Still have the beast, a feast for Odin to hit the table.

Ora & Labora is a juicy goods conversion game with an insane multitude of options. 

Although the top 3 are rated 9/10, Agricola is definitely at the top of the pile IMHO

The big box Uwe game that introduced the resource wheel mechanism that he used for a few games. Lots of cool stuff here. The spatial element with adding Buildings is cool as is how you can upgrade resources. However, I would only play this with 2 as you really need to see a lot of information (all of the other players buildings since you can also use them) and it does run pretty long. It also happens to be my gaming BFF Brian's #1 game, so now I have to hold onto it.

It's a good game.  I like the spatial element that Le Havre doesn't have.  I'm not sure I'll seek out playing it again, but since it will be played quite a bit around here I'll probably get the chance anyway.

a good game, fun and challenging, but nothing to do with his "parents." Agricola and Le Havre are and will always be masterpieces. Ora et Labora is a good game, and there is a big difference
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Cold as steel in a winter’s night, Ora et labora is a «multiplayer solitaire» like many other eurogames are: interaction between players is kept to a minimum and, to prevent them from getting too close, not even trades are allowed. Actually the game’s focus is just on collecting different kinds of resources, too many of them: luckily a nice parking disc comes in handy and helps keep track of the different amounts available throughout the game.

As one would expect of any eurogame, everything here works fine: it is more of a cold mathematical operation than an involving experience though, so one really has to love this kind of games to wish to play Ora et labora; everyone else will quickly find himself going adrift and struggling in a chilly ocean of resource collection and management.

In all honesty I can’t rate Ora et labora any higher.

On a side note, I couldn’t help but notice (and like) the in-game joke on a wood card showing a blue-dressed dancing man resembling Tom Bombadil as depicted by Tim Hildebrand in a renowned drawing of the 70’s. Really a nice touch.

RATING: 5.5
Typical game of Uwe Rosenberg, in the same universe of Agricola, La Havre, Caverna and others. There are around 20 different resources. There are many buildings. You have to use X building to create Y resource. Then another building to make from Y resource Z material. Then another building to make points from Z material. And etc. It also takes half an hour to prepare all the staff for the play. 
If you know Agricola, Inland Port, or other games and then check this one, you say oh no, again?...

Initial impressions
-----------------------

Fun euro game, however I did have a couple of issues with it.  One, I do not like how all the cards are used in every game.  This might not be an issue long term, since this game rewards players for doing something different than everyone else.  I have only played the short game, but even that felt a little long (yes it was with all new players).  I did like the mechanisms, and found the game to be fun.  Something I am definitely interested in playing more.

Really looking forward to this one - it has the beauty of Agricola with (hopefully!) less of the frustrating blocking that I loathe so much about that latter game.

Can't wait for English publication.

EDIT: It has arrived, and after 1 play was everything I expected. Unlike Agricola, it is very open-ended, and you are not punished for stepping outside the 'normal' route to victory. There are also none of the stupid cards that make every game unpredictable and unbalanced.

Interaction is quite high, and very subtle. In fact, of all the games I've played that are criticised as 'multiplayer solitaire', I'd say this one deserves the label least. You constantly have to watch your opponents' tableaux, and remain aware of what buildings and resources they have, and which ones they are going for.

I really enjoyed my play of this one last night, it might be the Uwe game I actually enjoy...

EDIT2: after four plays, 2x2p, 1x3p and 1x4p, I can say this:

There is a lot more depth to this game than Agricola, and that's saying something. The decision tree is wonderfully open and flexible. there are subtle differences between different parts of different resource trees (IE, the difference between getting one whiskey/beer with the lighthouse, and multiple if you've got enough grain with the brewery/malthouse). Al of this makes Agricola's basic game look bland by comparison, and even the with the cards looks less complex than basic Ireland Ora.

I'm really enjoying discovering the multiple paths to victory - it all seems phenomenally well-balanced, specialising in one thing (say, wonders vs. settlements) produces VERY tight games, and it feels like the trick is efficiencies, not that one strategy is weaker. Part of playing this game is about making sure you have maximised ingredients so resource conversion is quick. This might mean the game is "solvable" but with the variety of available buldings in different versions of the game I doubt it'll be a worry. I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.

I really hope this one, like Agricola, has a bunch of expansions.

2014: Only played once, when I got it. We jumped into a four-player full game (me, Jordan, K, Braden). We were totally over our heads and had to call it early.

I know that I want to like it, but it was so brain-burny and I don't know when I 'll try again.

This is a tough one to put a label on. I really like the way it plays a lot. Looking at the gameplay alone, it's probably my second favorite Rosenberg game behind Le Havre. However, it's a little too long to get many plays and the two player game has a pretty wonky ending that I'm not sure that I'm a fan of. Hard to nail this one down.

Uwe is back with what may be his best title yet!!! Ora et Labora adds a very challenging card placement mechanic to the insane "resource mash" from Le Havre. The wheel cleans the game up a bit and makes the round upkeep much more manageable then Uwe's previous titles. I think this may be the hardest game I've played.

Indeed very similar to Le Havre, so I find it thoroughly fascinating, especially as this theme is a little more fun :) Quite overwhelming the first time through with how much is going on and possible but also interesting. It does get knocked down a notch for being horrendously fiddily. This is normal in many games but between all the pieces, the order to set up and especially the tiny cards and print text on the cards (that you have to see around the table on other's tableaus) it deserves it

I've only played once so far but it compares very favorably to Agricola and Le Havre in difficulty, length, and good, delicious choices to make throughout. I do like the aspect that the food pressure is gone. That allows me to focus on my building strategy which sometimes is forced to be sidetracked in the other games. Was very well recieved by everyone and I'm excited to play this again soon. Oh, last thing...forget all the component issues everyone is griping about. The components are just fine the way they are. Fantastic game more than makes up for any qualms one might have for less than stellar components.

Very good resource conversion game type - but it is too long for my taste (almost 3 hours for two players). Also, it is very difficult to plan and execute selected strategy because of many many goods tokens and overwhelming number of builings in play. If it is not enough You have to fully control what is Your opponent doing. In my opinion it is too much for one box.

Le Havre meets Agricola, sort of. Ewe does it again. A lot of familiar elements: collecting resources, managing real-estate, building stuff, action-selection, all to basically create a VP engine. While familiar in some respects, Ewe has rearranged the elements to work in some unique ways making the game very much its own thing.

This game comes with oodles of bits and there is a lot of set-up required - maybe almost a little too much - the layout makes keeping track of what is available out there to "use" (other player's buildings) more difficult than in Le Havre. 

I enjoyed it well enough but it didn't strike me as a "must have," given I have the other two already and they haven't yet lost their charm. I'm surprised at how quickly and how high it jumped up on the Geek List. I don't think it is as good as either of its "uncles."

Ora & Labora, seems to be the better game with 2 or 3 players, because with 4 monks at the table, you can easily loose the overview over the action places. I lightly prefer still Le Havre for not so experienced players (it´s easier to hold all options in mind). I had an information overflow in my 1st game of OetL, cause i cannot really remember all of my 3 co-players buildings in the further rounds of the game. ....but the ressource wheel is a perfect 10!

Del creador de Agricola o Le HAvre, es un juego en que cada jugador tiene que gestionar su diócesis construyendo edificios, utilizandolos para transformar unos recursos en otros y ampliando su dominio. El juego tiene muchos recursos diferentes, pero su gestión durante el juego se lleva a cabo de una forma muy cómoda gracias a un inteligente rondel que va haciendo que la cantidad disponible de un recurso se vaya incrementado a medida que avanza la partida (si nadie lo toma claro).

En cuanto a mecánicas, me ha recordado mucho a Le Havre, por aquello de transformar unos recursos en otros. También toma del agricola la importancia de la ubicación de los edificios (las colonias puntuan segun lo que tengan alrededor). Me ha parecido muy entretenido y en todo momento tienes multiples formas de conseguir lo que quieres.. y tienes que escoger la que te reporta mayores ganancias. Además, también puedes utilizar los trabajadores de la diócesis de otros jugadores (les contratas).

En fin. Un juegazo como la copa de un pino. No es apto para no jugones. Con Gema ni me lo planteo... pero cualquier jugón creo que quedará encantado con el juego.

Me lo regaló Marc por mi cumpleaños, en Julio 2013. Ya se había ido a Bélgica, de modo que me cogió por completo  de sorpresa. Junto al Troyes, son los dos juegos más valorados de mi colección. Además de por el juego en sí, por que me los regaló un gran tipo.

Con gran dolor de mi corazón, lo vendí el 7/5/2015 a anguss, a través de la bsk. No tenía muchas posibilidades de jugarlo y andaba corto de cash, y tenía que hacer caja para pagar las CLBSK2015 (lo que me costó un disgusto con Gema) y tuve que poner unos cuantos títulos en venta. Lo vendí por 42€ con kiala incluido. Un regalo. 
Cuadno esté en mejores situaciones, me gustaría volver a conseguirle... más que por el juego en sí,que me gusta mucho, por los recuerdos que me trae.

Another great Rosenberg. Didn't like as much as Agricola, Caverna, or Le Havre- mainly because the sense of progression you get in those games as you build your engine is more fulfilling. Still, I could see this rising on replays. I did like the rondel mechanic, the three-pawns worker mechanic, and being able to spend money to use another player's pawns. definitely a better first-play than Glass Road for me, and overall very enjoyable.

Why did I wait so long to play this game? Having played Agricola and Le Havre, I thought this would be a similar experience. There are commonalities, but there is enough new goodness here to merit owning all three titles. Streamlined and gripping - this one seems lighter than other Rosenburg titles until you make it a few rounds in, at which point your brain will be overwhelmed at the seamless depth the game offers. This is a game that recreates much of what I love about Agricola without the text heavy cards.

Yes, all the comparisons to Le Havre are valid. I don't know that I want Le Havre to be on steroids.

Just way too many actions to choose from. Can anyone really keep track of the 25 action cards on each opponent's player board? Not unless you want every player to take 20 minutes per turn. And then 2.5 hours later, everyone breaks out their calculators and the score is 249 to 247. Is that really a meaningful win?

Update, traded it away after 3 plays. Don't see myself revisiting this when Le Havre is better and not nearly as over-wrought.

Surprisingly, this game was almost exactly how I thought it would be -- pretty good.

It's a mix of agricola and le havre, with a clever rondel wheel thingy that streamlines good production.  The buildings work in interesting ways, and there appear to be tons of different potential strategies.

After a single 2 player game, I'm left wanting to 
play again, which is pretty rare these days!

Update after a 4 player game:  a little too chaotic with 4, like le havre.   I think that 3 player will be where this one shines.

Certainly need more plays, but this game gets an initial 8, with lots of potential upside.

Two things keep me from returning to this game:

- the shoddy components
- the building cards which really need to be memorized in order to play.   Unfortunately we play it so irregularly that we need to relearn all of those card combinations each time we play.

RATING: 8
I was hoping that O&L would be the Rosenberg-lovers Rosenberg game, or at least, my favorite of his designs.  All the elements are there: conversion mania, open information, many paths to victory, none of which seem overbearing.  Yes, I certainly love games that revolve around converting things efficiently, and this offers plenty of conversions, and with nothing hidden, it should scratch that efficiency itch... very efficiently.

Sadly, though, the game falls short.  It is still a great game by one standard: I am immersed throughout.  Playing it is fun.  The problem, though, is that the conversion trees for this thing are too complex, with too many variables to mentally juggle.  Yes, the different paths to victory (buildings, settlements, and chits) seem balanced, but are they?  How can anyone tell - without investing days doing computations?  This is my main problem.  All the openness of the game leads to opacity, not clarity.  You have no standard by which to judge how good your performance was.  Certainly, at the end of the game, you recognize you could have done better, or been more efficient... but where?  

The problem is that you are constantly juggling short, mid, and long-term strategies, without knowing which one is the most efficient use of your time during that particular turn.  You can feel it out, intuit it, to some degree, but at the end of the game, you have that Power Grid feeling.  Oh, I won by 10 points?  Well, I must have done something right - but understanding what is pretty much impossible.  Without learning, every game becomes a set of semi-random initial choices (well, I'll start out concentrating on money this game) that continually butterfly out.  You try to surf the tactical wave as best you can, but that's about as good as it gets.  Yes, there are many turns where you could do a cost/benefit analysis of the best way to proceed for that particular turn, or even two, three, or four turns into the future... but a two player game is probably 35-40 turns long!  So the whole thing feels consistently opaque, consistently "new" every time.  There is always more you could analyze, but at a certain point, why bother?  This is not my full-time job.

Compared with Agricola and Le Havre, it lacks tension.  I don't mind, because as I said, I'm continually immersed, and I also find that some of the tension in those other games is false.  (In Le Havre, you can get along without feeding, and in Agricola, once you know the game enough, there are many categories you can consistently max out).  At any rate, it has more the feel of Loyang, but at least in Loyang the opacity is due to the hidden aspects of the game - the card draft, for instance.  So overall, Loyang gets the edge.  I'd like to be able to understand how to play better, but other than some intuitions that accumulate, I don't see how.

A very good game, even better than Agricola, IMO. Everyone talks about the production wheel as being the novel element here, but the real difference from Le Havre/Agricola is the spatial mechanic of scoring points based on where you place your buildings. This is why I like the game, because you really feel like you are building a colony, clearing forests and draining swamps, expanding the cloisters and attaching a network of towns and villages on a map. The insane number of different goods also leads to more complex chains of production in a way that surpasses Rosenberg's other games. I'd love to see an expansion.

The drawback of Ora et Labora is the small card size. I don't think the cards could have been produced any bigger though- you'd need too much play area and players would still be struggling to read the cards because they would be placed necessarily far away. It's a shame because the variety of options are good and the mechanics are slick.

Play 3 was the two-player game, and my feelings were much more positive than the first two plays with 4. I think the smaller game space is more comprehensible. Like Le Havre, you need to be focused on efficiency and high-value items, i.e., Wonders. So figure out how you're going to get them.

Like all the late-model Rosenberg games, it's won on pacing, knowing the pulse of the game, when to "cash in" a big efficiency play, and how much of any given resource you're really going to need. The pulse of Ora et Labora is, I think, harder to find than Le Havre or Agricola which are pretty straightforward. Not sure what that means.

The endgame for the 2-player game isn't great. You can actually be in a position, I think, where the game can get badly drawn out - there are multiple buildings still available to be built, but they're low-value and both players are doing better by cranking their engines, and the player who stops cranking to do the last low-value build will lose. Not sure. Too bad it doesn't have a fixed endpoint.
---
Couple plays in, I think it's too much - too many options, too flat a development tree. I wanted to like it, but I think it's just too overwhelming.
---
Hmm. On the one hand, I definitely don't get the "Le Havre+" vibe that some speak of. Yes, it's Rosenberg doing his thing, the thing he's been doing since Agricola, and if you expect him to be striking out in new directions, he's not. But he's a designer who likes his tropes, and there was no reason to expect he would. To me, Ora et Labora feels, mechanically, like a good theme-and-variations on what he's been doing successfully for a while now. You know what you're going to get, but it's changed up and the tensions are different than they are in his previous games.

What I'm less enthralled about is that the narrative tension seems be much less deftly handled here than in his previous games. Both Agricola and Le Havre nicely build, with constrained options at first that open up over time and aren't overwhelming. Ora et Labora hits you with great huge whacks of complexity at irregular intervals, then leaves you alone for a while, and it's very hard to digest or get any sense of. Also, unlike all his other games, Ora et Labora has no variability - it's all on the table from turn 1, and doesn't change from game to game. OK, but it makes it feel crushing for new players and for your first time out.

I think there is good stuff here, but I wish the game had the same attention to narrative that made Agricola so compelling. I also with it were a bit shorter but had more focussed play.

I'd suggest your first time out, you probably want to play with 2 or 3. With 4, it's a very complicated game, and can easily run long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think the description of a merge between Agricola and Le Havre is pretty apt here.  I'm a pretty big fan of Agricola, and not so hot on Le Havre, and I liked this game some where in the middle.

The goal in Ora is to build buildings, which you can then utilize to make goods and convert goods into other goods, eventually using them to build more buildings/score points.  You can also use other players' buildings for a fee, so you're not dead in the water if someone builds a building that was central to your strategy!

Overall, a good game in the "make stuff and convert it into other stuff to convert into points" genre.  If you think that sort of game is too dry, this game isn't for you. but if you like this sort of optimization game, it's a good one!

Another of Uwe Rosenberg's big resource-conversion Euros! I really enjoyed the spatial puzzle of placing your buildings and settlements in the proper environments and maximizing adjacency points. The resource wheel was also a really neat idea and I liked that it wasn't as punishing as some of his other games. The game did suffer from resource overload though. There were just too many resources and trying to find the right chits was just slowing the game down too much on our first play. I also wish there were a bit more variability form game to game as far as buildings go. Regardless, a very good Rosenberg that fans of brainy Euros will definitely enjoy!

Damn! I absolutely LOVE Agricola and Le Havre (and even Loyang), so I had extremely high expectations for this game. That's always dangerous because you risk being let down, and that was exactly what happened to me when playing this game.

I think my rating will increase when I play this game more as I think it's very important to know the buildings in the game and how to convert goods! In our first game we kind of didn't really know what to focus on. It wasn't as bad in our second game (both games the long, Ireland version) as we had a clue of which buildings would come up and do what and which goods could be converted to which goods etc., but ultimately I would just much rather play Agricola or Le Havre, which actually plays faster than this game.

I did like the wheel mechanic and the spatial element and how to place your buildings to get most dwelling points - it's just, I think there are better games out there which can be played in a shorter time frame and doesn't require you to know how all the buildings/goods interact before your first game (perhaps it's a bit rough, but that's what I feel).

As a big fan of Agricola and Le Havre, I was very much anticipating playing this one - and it delivers. Arguably the best game of the bunch.

While it doesn't have the stress of the harvest, it does have a "harvest" in a certain sense. Getting the best settlement cards can really up your score, and not having enough food and energy will hinder that. All the strategy of harvest with no stress - genius move by Uwe.

This has a very good chance of being my favorite game.

Not sure on this one yet as we only played the short game.  It seems like you get tons and tons of chits, but actually turning those chits into points is the challenge.  There is a lot to take in for one play, so I'm curious to play again.

Rated 7 after one play. So, admittedly, I was not terribly excited to try this one. I generally like games that have harsh systems or that force choices instead of offering a wide open playground with dizzying ranges of choices. Le Havre falls into that latter category, and so when Ora et Labora was described to me as similar, right down to the ability to use other people's buildings, I figured it wasn't for me.

This was better than I expected, and better than Le Havre. For whatever reason, this seems to have a better theme, but it preserves that resource conversion/improvement that I like about Le Havre. The placement of buildings is interesting. One play is not enough to assess, but count me as interested in a 2nd play.

Update: I kept thinking about that first game, and actually picked this up via a trade. Now the goal will be to get some more plays of this title.

Update: So, tried this as a solo game (487 points, Ireland). Not bad... great way to learn the buildings and the waves of resource conversion and scoring options, which is probably the biggest barrier to entry. I might try this with the France side, but that's probably the only solo playing I'll do with this game.

Update: 496 solo points with France. Close, but no cigar (or baguette).

Update: 501 solo with Ireland, and that probably wraps up any solo play.

Update: two more plays now, and I'm bumping this up to an 8. I keep wanting to play this game, even though I'm not terribly good at it! A couple observations... the sheer diversity of resources keeps this a challenge, but when you couple that with the placement of settlements, this will really make your brain melt. The game really tells a nice story from start to finish, so the game's length is totally justified. I don't know about other groups, but we're banging out a game in about two hours.

Update: ... and I've now played this game a dozen or so times. Every play reveals something new to me, and I grow fonder of this game with each play. This is truly a keeper.

I'm getting syndicalism in my old age but this didn't strike me as offering anything. New or doing anything with particular elegance. It compares poorly to le havre without the elegance or the competitiveness of its contemporary. Perhaps repeat plays will redeem it, but at this stage it lacks a little ...... Fun.

My word, where to begin...? Pretty much pure crunch, in every manner, and very complex - most certainly not for neophytes of the hobby or those after a light-hearted session. Not my favourite of Rosenburg's harvest games... but I can appreciate the solid underlying mechanics. I have seeen many call it a sandbox game... and while it does put me in mind of a medieval Sim City - hundreds of ways to score, it is still limited in only offering a few desired goals. Plus, in-keeping with this idea, it is nice to see a range of artwork on the forest/peat bog terrain cards - something that would be easy to skimp on...

Could have done with several more buildings for the beach, water, hill, and mountain territories, as there are so very few included - but it looks like no add-on is forthcoming.

One thing I think could be changed is randomising the buildings that can be built on each round, rather than having them all available all the time - add a little luck and strategy into a game that otherwise has very little. And without them, the sandbox aspect does become somewhat of a tedious grind... which is a true shame.

Really nice game with 2 scenarios included.  I could see more scenarios added for expansion but the game is great as it is.  The game included several cool game mechanics : Rondell, Worker placement, Tile placement, Ressources management.  The only bad thing would be the game is not so great at 2 players and can only go up to 4.  The pace of the game is relatively fast for a Euro game, I like this one a lot.

Looking forward to trying this. The component clutter is obscene (almost as bad as FFG's fare) but the resource- tracking boards in the files section obviate that wonderfully. (Thank you!) Theme: check, slow building growth of community and engine: check. Lack of variable set-up is unfortunate but hopefully waddball's Flanders and Normandy set cards will help alleviate that some.

RATING: 6
When I played Le Havre, I was profoundly bored by it.  The mechanics were fine (actually, it was so long ago that I don't remember how it plays anymore), but I felt incredibly bogged down by just having a ridiculous number of items to pay attention to.

Ora & Labora is similar, but with many more interesting mechanics to keep me from feeling worn out before the final rounds.  Primarily, I felt the method of obtaining basic materials a la nifty wheel was an interesting way of re-packaging things like Puerto Rico's "add a buck" method of incentivising unused actions, and the yellow cards and village bonus cards (as well as additional game boards) made building placement a much more important and fun aspect of the game.

The pawn usage also added a clever method of control to the board as well - do we tie up opponents' boards to keep them from using their actions, or do we fill our own to keep our priory available for those powerful free actions?  Is it worth paying out a coin (or two) for those other actions, or will our own serve well enough?

But, overall, the thing that dragged it down was the same thing as Le Havre, albeit to a lesser extent: I don't want to have to look at everybody's board (and often, every single card).

My real problem with games like this is that it's too easy to lead me, not even really to AP, but just to time wasting because I'll likely want to see every card - I can skim the cards and risk missing one or misunderstanding the benefits, or I can spend the time required to read every single one available to me.  I have to balance my desire to not feel like I'm wasting a lot of time with my desire to not feel like I may have just made an obvious oversight.  Both of these tend to lead to unfortunate experiences, but at least I don't have a lot of these choices to make until a lot later in the game (which, if I recall correctly, was not the case in Le Havre).  I'll play this again if it comes up, but will not suggest it.

Resource conversion overload, with limited variability and a spacial element that feels underdeveloped. A solid design from Rosenberg, but not as compelling as Agricola or Le Havre in my opinion. I do dislike the 2-sided tokens and the hobbit cards that you cannot clearly read from across the table. Last nail on the coffin was Fields of Arle that does whatever O&L is supposed to do much better, albeit for 2 players only (for the moment..).

Dislikes: Definitely a learning curve here. Prone to some analysis paralysis.

My favorite of Uwe Rosenberg's "harvest" style of games.  Definitely prefer this over Agricola, but Le Havre runs a close second to this game.  But I think this game wins out over Le Havre in terms of the variety of strategies (mind you, based on limited plays of Ora et Labora).  

Enjoyable, if possibly somewhat tiring at the same time.

I like the setting and theme, although it doesn't fullfill the "monastic experience" as Agricola does with the "farming experience".

The game is obviously very deep, almost too deep, and this prevents new players from enjoying the (false) illusion that they know what they are doing.

My great personal concern are the red "do nothing but score" buildings that add nothing to the theme and prevents a more general use of building combos. The settlements are just plain boring but provided most of the points in my games so far.

Two games in:
Didn't live up to my unrealistic expectations. Not a bad game, but still prefer Le Havre. The O&L wheel is a nifty idea, but in practice doesn't really improve the game to me. In fact it seems easier to add a couple resources every turn than to count out a large number of resources when you take them. And it's easier to make mistakes when taking large numbers. I liked the extreme simplicity of taking resources being your turn. In O&L now you have to use a worker even when doing that. It's not a big deal, but still. But more importantly, I miss the pacing of Le Havre, the burden of feeding your people every round, the multiple ways of doing it, the nuances of loans, of building sequencing, of special buildings. I don't like that there is no random setup in O&L. The spacial aspects in O&L don't seem to make up the difference for what I miss from LH. Sure, where you put stuff matters, but it's a bit puzzly, where you just arrange things for the most vp. Where you put them doesn't affect gameplay at all.

Le Havre without piles of bits.I enjoyed my play and would prefer this over Le Harve with more than two players. Played once with three and each of us used different paths to victory. Game play was faster than Le Havre but does not have the variation of Agricola or Le Havre because the cards in a three player are always the same. If I could only own one of the three and only play with adults then I'd pick this one. I can Agricola with an eight year old (she loves the sheeples), but not this one so I won't buy it, but someone I know should.

There's lots going on with this game, but I even after 4 plays I feel like I don't have a clue, and I won my last game.

I think it may be a game of doing your best on 2-4 moves of outlook, and seizing tactical choices when they manifest.

If you have played any of the Euro-Anno pc games such as 1602, 1503, 1701 or Anno2070 this board game is similar.

Ora Labora is a unique game design with neat game mechanics.  Player options seem boundless which can seemingly overwhelm some players.  I'm not crazy about the card quality as some of the small cards spin around (this game could of had better quality control with nicer game components).  The game is a real thinkers, heavy euro style game.  All in all, I believe there is great potential for replayability over the years and I look forward to playing this more as I only have 3 games under my belt as of the end of September 2013.  This game has made my list of top 50 euro style games of all time.

Fiddly but very well thought out and easily - once you play it - to understand economical game.

It is not my kind of game, but I can see the potential, because you build and get something, build more, get some more, etc.... This can be very addictive.

The interaction-level is not its greatest strength, for you try to build your engine - but the rule to use the buildings of your fellow gamers maybe the thing to counter my first impression of this side of the game.

Not sure what I think of this - it feels like Uwe Rosenberg concentrate, a game similar in style to his earlier titles but a higher-proof draught. It may be too much of that style for me, or possibly I simply feel like I've played that sort of game enough, but I'm not strongly drawn to play again.

(That said, I quite like the layout / spatial element.)

Wow, that's all I can say after playing this. It's a resource management galore, on steroids. It reminds me of The Settlers (PC game, not Catan), and I really love that game where you can process goods from grain to flour to bread to food for worker to build other buildings, and other resources that have their own path. There's almost nothing that I dislike about this game (the player boards is okay, not bad)

The only gripe is the name, or to some extent, the theme. I don't see why it needs to be about clergymen, since you could retheme it into normal medieval village trying to grow and I would dig it better. During my first time playing I keep wondering where is the "religion" theme in this game, and at the end it's none.

Two plays: 2 player game and 4 player game.  

Good: The rondel is unbelievably awesome.  Simply a great upkeep management tool. Also, the spatial component of the game gives it more depth and flavor than Le Havre.  

Bad: Too long.  AP is not as long in 2-player, but in 4-player (where you only have 1 action a turn) the AP becomes pretty brutal because the choices are simply overwhelming at times.  Player interaction is very sparse. It's also hard to see other people's buildings.  And as for the buildings, memorizing them and when they come out will help you do well.    

Conclusion: Better than Le Havre in every way. It's less cutthroat than Agricola.  So Ora > Agricola > Le Havre.

Take bits of agricola and le havre and mix them into a game that drags and doesn't really engage the players.

A game that didn't need to be made, IMO.

It seems certain predictable (i.e. boring) patterns will emerge in every game (e.g building settlements in checkerboard patterns)

Much prefer Agricola where you are pushed into a different path every game by the occupations/minor improvements.

Nothing really new here, but succeed in mixing the best of both games. Streamlined, yet plenty of options. There is less pressure to pay with food or energy than in the above games, but if you save some foods or energy you can convert them into big points.

Not necessary if you own both aforementioned games. But better value than any Agricola variants.

Each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings – little enterprises that will gain resources and profit.

I like the illustrations and the cloister-setting plus the fact that this is two games in one (France and Ireland version).

Not quite as good as Le Havre, but still shares enough stuff to make it comparable. I don't care for the spatial part of this game. In Agricola, where you place your farm stuff isn't of much consequence. Not so in this game, as it can mean a lot of lost points if you don't do it perfectly. While not as bad as that in Princes of Florence or Antiquity, it is enough to make me like the game less because of it.

From the same designer as Agricola and Le Havre, this game shares many features and mechanics of those games. (And also the Agricola expansion Farmers of the Moors.)

While this is certainly a great game and everything about it works well together, it does seem like it was a bit too much of a safe bet. It all feels very familiar... like he was maybe pandering to those clamoring for Agricola 2.0.

Update: The differences in this game are starting to stand out more to me. I still wish it didn't feel so derivative... but for the moment, I'm no longer considering trading it. (I had been thinking that it's so similar to Agricola and Le Havre, why have all three? ...)

Decent euro, and pretty much fires [i]Agricola[/i] for this type of game. Not that I was planning on playing Agricola again any time soon.

The ability to use other people's cards, including some screwage by forcing their workers to be used, is a bonus. The downside is that it can result in some serious AP with so many choices available.

RATING: 8
Ora et Labora clearly is an update of Le Havre. Le Havre's set-up is partially random. Although the randomness is minimal, it is sufficient to vary the play from game to game. Ora et Labora includes no randomness, so variable play is produced by inundating the players with buildings and goods, by including two variants (Ireland and France), and by introducing a placement puzzle.

I guess the idea is that figuring out how to coordinate the goods, buildings, and placements will create a decision tree so large that play never will become scripted. Could be, but that approach also makes the game directionless. In Le Havre, the goal is clear, namely, build up a cache of steel going into the final turn. In OetL, it's not at all clear what you should be doing.

Fun, but a notch below Le Havre, in my view, and longer, too, believe it or not.

Since I do enjoy Agricola and Le Havre, I was looking really forward to Ora et Labora. Now that I've played it twice, my enthusiasm has faded a bit. I still think that Ora et Labora is a fine game that I'll hopefully play again, but all in all this game has just too much of everything for my taste. 

There are a ton of different buildings you can build so after a while, the options become overwhelming. It's like you can combine the actions of all of your deck's cards in Warhammer Invasion at once. On top of it, you have the spatial element that you have to manage. This is coupled with a long playtime and and a lot of downtime. I guess, all this things can be overcome with more experience, but I fear that Ora et Labora is just too long and feels too much like work in the early stages for my gaming group. So sadly, I don't think that we'll become experienced enough to reach a new level of enjoyment. But nevertheless, if you do like heavy euro games, give this one a try. I guess I'll stick to Agricola and Le Havre as they feel more streamlined.

On a sidenote: Somehow I like the resource piling in Le Havre better than the resource wheel. You just grab the pile and your done. No counting. But that's just my personal preference.

Takes LeHavre's resource management, and adds in Agricola's player mat building mechanics.   It's an evolution of both games, but I'm not sure it surpasses either of them.   I like them all equally, and this is a fine addition to Uwe's legacy of great games.

I wanted to play again before rating, because I think there may be a decent game here.  Unfortunately, having to track everyone else's boards, the current card market, the card with all the future markets' cards, and the resource rondel is just a bit of information overload for me.  I had the same problem with Le Havre, and I was likewise turned off.  I think if I got to the point when I knew what was coming up, or at least vaguely, then my rating could go up.  But that's a high hurdle to get over when there are fantastic games out there that don't require that kind of buy-in.

I get torn on games like this.  I had a fun time playing it, because I enjoy the people that were playing with me.  But this is not my favorite type of game.  It has so many options, that the winner is often the person willing to take up more of the other player's time by looking at more of the available options.   In this case, it was me, and I still never looked at more than half of my options on any given turn.  You'd have to play with a clock for this game to make any sense.  Seriously, by the end of the game, you will have over 50 valid options on your turn.  And that's only if you are thinking about the current turn, and NOT planning ahead to the next turn.

Normally this type of game gets a 3 from me, because it is very unlikely that I would ever play again.  But I had fun, and I know one of the other players wants to play again, so it is likely that I will play it with them.

Reminds me a lot of Le Havre.  Buildings come out which you can build. Only one person can use each building.  It's still different enough to offer a new experience.  Those who like luck in there games should stay away from this  one.  Like Le Havre, the only luck in this game is determining who goes first.

Looking forward to another play.

Players are monks in medieval France or Ireland (two variants to play).  Players take actions to use a building, clear land, or build a building.  Clearing land gives you wood or peat; using building gets you other resources, or turns resources into more advanced stuff; building buildings gives you victory points and cheap access to that building's function.  Every few turns, game play is interrupted to allow player's to build a settlement - a building that does nothing but earn victory points for lucrative adjacent buildings at the end of the game.  Big, long game of producing stuff, and churning it through the buildings into other stuff.  If you are a Rosenberg big game fan, you'll lap it up.  I'm a Rosenberg "take it or leave it" guy, and I'm not so convinced.  It feels like the other big games he's done, with a few tweaks and new artwork.  On the plus side, there are solo and fast play variants.  Good for a few plays, then off to the marketplace, I suspect.

As many have already commented, it's a lot like Le Havre, but just a bigger more complicated sandbox with extra ways to score.  It's far from a Le Havre killer I'm afraid to say.  The added complexity doesn't make up for the sharper learning curve.  Additionally I feel like every game is much the same as the previous.  There are different directions and strategies to explore, but the same buildings in the same order each time just doesn't do a lot to bring me back to the table after exploring the basic strategies.

RATING: 9
A flawed gem.

There are some serious UI issues.   It is almost impossible to see what buildings my neighbors have even when sitting right next to them.   The cards are just too small.  Even 25% bigger would have helped.   Or maybe the icons on the cards could have been done better.   The magazine paper reference sheets, the postcard-thin player boards and extensions...  it all feels very cheap for a $70 retail game.   The wood bits and central dial are very nice, on the other hand.  Too bad the whole package wasn't executed to that level.

Speaking of the dial...   it removes SOME fiddlyness from the game, but certainly not all of it.   There are dozens of chits, and you will be adding them to the bank or withdrawing them in reams at a time throughout the game.   So, still plenty of fiddle here.  Don't be fooled by the clever dial.

But the game itself...   wow!  It is one of those games that keeps you thinking about it nonstop, even days after playing.   The amount of options towards the end becomes staggering, so you won't want to play with AP-prone people or it could become excrutiating.   It seems like a game that is best left to gut instinct and some careful planning without excessive over-calculation.

Gets better with every play, as the UI issues tend to fade away and everyone becomes familiar with the cards.  Zero luck.   No downtime, as you are always thinking and planning ahead when it isn't your turn.   Shines in both 2 and 3-player modes.

My 3rd favorite of the whole Uwe series.  Ora has a few twists that make it stand out over the similar titles.  It has the same qualities as Le Havre of being able to use other players' buildings, but there aren't quite as many to worry about.  It also feels to me like the resource types and conversions are easier to manage, but that may just be my imagination.  The real difference is that instead of being forced to pay set amounts of food, you're encouraged to build scoring structures (which just happen to cost lots of food).  You can get away with lower-value 'harvests', but this will have a negative impact on your score.  
At the same time, you're trying to build up a network of buildings into which these scoring structures will fit, like atoms in a crystal lattice.  This positional puzzle is good fun, and there are some other wrinkles, like trying to match terrain types, buy & clear land, keep your monastery contiguous, and so on.  About my only complaint is that there are some of the terrain types that aren't really useful, since there's only a single building that can go there (ex. the houseboat on the water or the castle in the mountains).

A colourful, strategic gem of a game to play. Nothing is ever out of reach for all players and every path you decide to take is usually a good option. Plenty of choices, plenty of interaction, but at times completely overwhelming. The teaching time may not be worth the effort, as every card needs to be understood and utilized at all times, regardless if it's available for purchase or owned by a player.

60-90m, best with 2-3 players. 5+ plays.

RATING: 8
Ora et Labora is basically a re-imaginging of Le Havre but it does have elements of Agricola in there as well.  How do they compare?

Things I prefer in OeL when compared with Agricola:

-Equal distribution of workers with no chance of having more having more than anyone else.
-No forced strategy diversification that can result in negative points for failure
-No forced feeding phase that can result in negative points for failure

Things I liked about Agricola that OeL incorporates:

-Having forests and peat take up spaces on individual player boards

Things I prefer in OeL when compared with Le Havre:

-I don't find any given resource becomes useless in OeL, even in the late game.
-I like that it's harder to block players off from specific building use.  If someone squats a worker on their own building in Le Havre (ie Wharf) there's nothing you can do about it until they move.
-No mandatory feeding phase [b]every damn round[/b].  That being said, failing to feed and taking a loan wasn't as bad as the begging card in Agricola.

Things I liked about Le Havre that OeL incorporates:

-Agricola does have resource conversion but it's to a much lesser extent than Le Havre.  Thankfully OeL is closer to Le Havre in this respect.
-It could be argued that LH's energy and OeL's fuel are the same kind of resource.  Agricola's fuel is a bit different than energy, but OeL acquires fuel the same way: through peat on your board.  Well, some buildings as well.
-I like that LH let's you focus on whatever strategy you want without penalty unlike Agricola and OeL continues in the same vein
-I like that OeL stayed similar to Le Havre in that you are creating buildings and using them to mostly do resource conversion and that you're able to use opponents buildings at a cost.

"Ok, so you complain about the Feeding phases of Agricola and Le Havre, but not the Settlement phase Ora et Labora? You do realize you probably won't win if you don't settle!"

While that is true you should probably settle every phase you have an opportunity to do so to have a decent shot at winning, it's still less constraining in OeL compared to Gric and LH.  Why?  OeL gives you multiple settlements with different costs.  So when a settlement phase comes up it's not like in Agricola "oh damn I have to get food or I lose" or Le Havre "I have to have this much money/food or start taking loans."  OeL is more like, "ok, so a settlement phase is coming up, I need a minimum of X to play this small settlement but if I can attain these resources I could get this higher cost one out."  It's a completely different feeling.  OeL's seems the lease stressful, LH is closer to OeL and Agricola's is just stressful.

So, what sets Ora et Labora apart?

-The spatial element of your buildings dwelling values in relationship to your settlements, your cloister buildings having to be adjacent to one another, and what kind of land requirements are needed to be able to place certain kinds of buildings/settlements.  When thinking spatially, you'll need to purchase additional land as well as clear spots of forest and peat to be able to open up places for your buildings and settlements.  The order and choices in which you do all of these spatial issues in conjunction with the the ongoing resource game makes this a deliciously heavy game.

-The resource wheel.  I'm not going into detail about this but the way it makes everything in the game flow compared to Gric and LH, [i]this is innovation[/i].

-Resources as stated earlier don't generally tend to become useless.  Up until LH and gric, you had: food, building resources, money, and energy.  Not only does OeL pull this off stunningly, you can now convert resources into various resources that are worth varying amounts of VP.  If that wasn't enough, depending on what types of VP resources you have, you can possibly convert them into a Mega VP tile called a Wonder.

-If all that wasn't enough, you can play the game two different ways: Ireland and France.  Each one has different buildings and resources available within it along some commonalities between each of the two versions.

This is excellent.

Another microturn game from Ewe. At this point, I think I would put this title a little behind Le Havre, but we'll see. OeL may be no longer than Le Havre, but I felt the length a little more than the other titles. One aspect I noticed on the first play that I really appreciated was the importance of basic goods in the late game. One never thinks about fish late in Le Havre, but I was thinking about peat and sheep late in the game. The goods dial is a great way to reduce the fiddly aspect seen in LH. 

I'm getting a little burned out on the microturn goods maximize formula. A little part of me hopes OeL stops the churn of these games, but a bigger part of me knows it won't stop here.

Call me an old fogey but I remember when eurogames were simple and elegant like Modern Art and Ra. Agricola and Le Havre may be more complicated compared to those classics but Ora et Labora takes the cake on complexity. 

It's not a terrible game - the base Uwe engine is there and it still works but in Ora, it's easy to be overwhelmed by all the possibilities. And it all kicks off right from the beginning - no easing in or what have you. Players must juggle not just their economic/VP engine but also manage "tile-placement" of their buildings. It's all a little bit much.

Also, with four players, the game is really long - as long as a mid-complexity wargame, which for a euro is too ridiculous.

RATING: 7
I had very high hopes going into this game since I am a big fan of Uwe Rosenberg.  I was elated when I saw the components and really liked the press your luck feel of the wheel mechanic. There are a ton of resources which lends the game to making multiple paths to victory if you try to focus on a few specialty areas- and that's great and interesting and fun.  But, what didn't do it for me was the puzzley nature of arranging your cloister to maximize points. now I thought this was going to be a peripheral kind of thing, but I quickly found out in my first at and everyone thereafter that building placement is a very significant part of the game. So arranging your board and building in certain areas and saving money to buy your multiplier cards is hugely important and will dictate a lot of your actions.  The game rewards repeated plays because knowing those core cards and how they will multiply your victory points is HUGE.  But it felt like an annoying puzzle that you had to regularly adapt.  I would've liked more variety In the core buildings, as well.  Perhaps something more asymmetrical? Anyway, it's a solid game, but not one Im a huge fan of... I'll stick with caverna and Le Havre!

Although the game doesn't last too long [4h first time], in the actual play I had a feeling it could end exactly in its half. No real dynamics in here, just steady pace of doing same and same things all over again.

What I disliked most: it is hard to estimate the situation on table, with every player's boards filled with several structures, every single one with 2-3 important data. Simplicity of Agricola was way moar cool!

What is important is: the game works really fine! It is a great 'let's make victory point building machines' game. I just didn't like the feeling of it.

RATING: 7
This is a huge resource conversion puzzle chopped up into tiny bits, and your job is to reassemble a better picture than your opponents. The conceit here is the forced contract innovation to the worker placement whereby you can use an opponent’s piece to visit a building for you (for a fee, of course). The challenge is in identifying an efficient conversion path via player buildings. They may be your buildings or they may belong to other players, but you need to identify that path and make it work just a little better than your opponents. In a shift from Agricola, there’s an optional Settlement phase instead of an obligatory feeding phase.

RATING: 10
Rated a 9 after one play (2P "short" version). Initial thoughts: Like Le Havre without the tension and any one obvious optimal strategy). Lots of complexity and replayability. I give it a 9, which is right between my ratings for Le Havre (8.5) and Agricola (the only game I've given a 10 rating). Its strengths are also its flaws: so many different ways to score points and so much balance makes it difficult to choose a strategy with any confidence, and creates the conditions for some serious analysis paralysis, especially in the endgame.  That said, after my first play, I wanted to play again right away to try to do things differently.  Which I will do tonight, I hope.

This is a clever combination of Agricola and Le Havre.  The resource wheel in particular is an excellent mechanism.  However, the graphic design is not as effective and in general the game is more work than either of its two parents.  I can't see the cards from across the table.  After just one play I'm not convinced it's anything I want to play again, especially given the graphic challenges.

Great game at first with lots of resource conversion paths and ways to points and lots of meaty choices. But, after game 7 I had to drop the score from 8 to 7 as it is starting to feel repititious. And ultimately it seems that despite all of the options, the big points come mostly from those 30 point end game conversions. We will see how well this continues to hold up.

RATING: 6
[2016 March 02; 5 plays; 6/10]
My first play of this blew my mind. It was a full-length solo play and lasted something like 3 hours, all the while, I loved the ability to take my time and fully analyze the perfectly track-able information. Mind you that I had only played a small amount of games at this time, but it immediately shot into my top 5. Now, 4 plays later of the 2 and 3 player short games, I'm bored.

Uniquely, it has a huge pool of resources (some >20 resources), uses a rondel for simple upkeep, has no randomness, and some of the coolest sandbox elements in a board game I've seen (expanding land ownership and city-building for additional work placement spots). Points are made by constructing buildings in your monastic landscape, and then using those buildings to gain and convert resources. The buildings players use typically produce a unique set of resources, or they do some unique resource conversion, and players can pay one another to use their landscape's buildings.

All of this is rather boring for a 3 hour game though! The competition is indirect, non-destructive, and largely non-aggressive. The primary exercise is to perform min-max calculations of resource conversion, where complications occur when another player blocks you, but there are so many paths to victory that it's (a) difficult to predict the path your opponent is attempting to take (in comparison to games with less choices) and (b) when one does block an opponent, there are still plenty of other, rather viable choices. I find this ultimately boring!

Rating based on one play.  I found this much more 'forgiving" than Le Havre and Agricola (no food in winter / interest on loans) and much more enjoyable as a result.  Three player game and we all enjoyed it and want to play more.   Given that I played this the week after Keyflower (which I own) then I won't be rushing out to buy Ora et Labora.  Usual problem with these multiplayer-solitaire games of seeing what everyone else has and can thus exploit.

[b]Wonderful, complex goods-exchange game with low-stress. No variable setup, which could hurt game after 20+ plays. The basics of the game are more fun than Le Havre, but Le Havre's variability is attractive.

I traded this away only because a friend still owns it, and I still own Le Havre. I got good value in the math trade.[/b]


JUNE 2014 - After two dozen games of Le Havre (which possesses a very similar central mechanic, and is designed by the same person) and after doing tons of research before trading for Ora & Labora, I am stoked to be playing this Ora.

For my tastes, Ora is the better game of the two - with setting and artwork I prefer, and a wide open strategic tree. Le Havre has a small advantage with the variable set-up, and yet the game still plays out quite samey to me, with several main branches to race for VPs (build and ship). I LOVE that Ora takes away feeding, ships, and shipping, and replaces it with acquiring various land plots, spatial placement, and more goods to pursue victory with. 

My gut feeling: I will get at least 20 good plays out of this, keep it in my collection for a couple years, and never rate it lower than a 9.

Since it looks like there will never be an expansion for this, I'm in the process of designing one (an Upper Canada variant with westward expansion, native contact, etc.). Feel free to drop me a line if you're interested in helping me test/develop it.

July 2014: Finally got a 3er going, and it was a blast. Including teaching two new players, we were done in less than 2h30m. The end game is MUCH different in 3p games: you must be much more focused near game-end, and have fewer overall game actions. Makes the end-game of the 2p short version seem clunky and almost broken (a player with a good engine near game end won't end the 2p game in order to generate more points).

9th play: 9. OCT/14. I think that's my last play of 2p. It's a good game, but just doesn't shine with 2, in my opinion. Best with 3p. I wish I could mash the variability of Le Havre with the spatial placement and no-feeding-necessary of Ora & Labora. I would have the 2nd best game of all time on my hands.

10th play: 9. Oct/14. First time on France board, and really starting to understand the importance of focus for point generation. Building is always good, but generating points... Gotta get'er done. Taught Dewald, who also enjoyed it.

I wish Ora & Labora were a completely different game, which it isn't--it has strong elements of Le Havre, and to a lesser degree, Agricola.  Le Havre has similar bits, conversions of resources, and building.  In Agricola resources build up and then someone gets to them before you do.  Despite the similarities, this plays very differently, and I like the play. 

Pros:  Replay-ability with two different countries to play and short and advanced games.  I like the scoring of the settlements, and the various avenues to gaining points.  

Cons:  It is fiddly, even more than Le Havre.   The boards of of poor quality--thin cardboard, not the heavy boards in Agricola.  Like Le Havre, lots of two-sided chips--one side with an item, the other side with the item upgraded.  But unlike Le Havre, the two sides are of completely different colors and we all were continually getting misled and mixing the chips up. 

Uwe Rosenberg is making some very strong games.  My order of ranking for the series:
Gates of Loyang
Le Havre
Ora & Labora
Agricola

(I am also a great fan of his Merkator.)

RATING: 7
Nice game. Setup stays the same for every game, but game changes dramatically.
I feel the most important way of scoring points is through settlements; it's a thing you can't take up lightly; but there are many strategies to get resources to get settlements.
Timing is very important.
I have yet to understand if paying for a work contract is useful or not (and if it is for the other end of the contract!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Massive game that feels a lot like Le Havre, with even more resource types and so many different ways to score.

It's a pseudo worker placement that involves timing more than priority; the ability to place opponents' workers is interesting and no doubt much more important than we understood.

There's a constant feeling that everything coming out is so much better. The positive settlement phase replaces the negative pressure of feeding but is still just as critical to score.

Once again it's probably best with 3p, and if you intend to replay the game repeatedly.

The inclusion of Ireland/France is mindblowing.

It's early and I've only played it two player, normal game. The gameplay feels like swinging in the dark, not sure if you're hitting anything. Things feel easy to get, not the brutal feedback of agricolas starving family. However, I do really like it and think it will feel tighter when I learn what a good score is and can provide tension with my own expectations. So far the regular two player ending has not been a problem and greed to get the buildings ends things just fine.  Like Loyang and Agricola, the well done theme and friendly artwork have a strong pull for me.  Although I do miss the presence of any humans in the artwork, which give games like agricola, loyang and St. Petersburg so much charm. Ora is played from a higher view, that's all. 

I'm excited to explore this game!

I would like to play three player but not four. I prefer deeper euros with fewer players to avoid AP and downtime.

I was very excited to try Ora et Labora as Le Havre is in my list of top 10 games, and I heard that this might even be better.  Now that I’ve played this “upgrade”, I’m not sure if I’d call it better, but it’s certainly right up there.   I like having 3 workers to place instead of just the one, and the goods selection wheel is genius.  I also appreciate the addition of the spatial element that the village cards bring, and the idea of having to pay extra to get enough room to play certain types of cards. There are a lot of cards to get familiar with, and many, many ways to score points – so much so that it’s almost overwhelming to try and figure out how all of the various resources work together.  But once a player is able to map out many of the potential routes to victory, it does work together very well.

Essen 2011 (1 game experience):  Agricola will probably always be my most favorite game ever. THerefore I have high hopes for each new Rosenberg release. However, so far I have always been disappointed. Like Le Havre you have to know the possible production chains of the different buildings in order to master the game. Therefore: as a beginner amongst others who already know the game you are totally screwed, and as a non-frequent player of the game, you probably won't remember the possible chains any more, so your learning curve almost starts from scratch again.

RATING: 6
In a way, Ora et Labora is merely a friendlier version of Le Havre. Players collect resources which they then use to construct buildings which then provide additional action choices and/or points. The similarities don't top at superficial thematic elements, though. There are resource "stacks" that grow until somebody grabs them, at fixed intervals you need additional food and/or fuel to extend your village, and you can pay your fellow players to use one of their buildings.

Simply said, if you already have Le Havre you probably don't need Ora et Labora. So what makes Ora et Labora "more friendly?" For one, it is shorter than its ancestor, though probably not by much. It also feels a little more forgiving because the feeding phase is kind of optional. If you have (and pay) the resources you gain an additional extension to your village, if you don't nothing happens. This effect is mostly psychological, and it's there simply because there is no punishment other than not scoring additional points.

Finally, even though the tiny building cards make it more difficult than it needs to be for new players, Ora et Labora has less variability. There is always the same set of buildings entering play at the exact same time (well, the game actually includes two different sets of buildings, but that's beside the point) so after a game or two they should be familiar and there is nothing to dramatically alter the game balance like some of the special buildings in Le Havre do.

The best Euro I've played so far. No randomness in the game at all. The only concern I have with it is that after repeated plays (over 50, or even 100) it might turn into chess - everyone will know what the optimal moves are. Will have to wait and see (probably for a long time :) )

Best Rosenberg that I personally played so far.
The component issues reported from the early editions are non existent with the lookout 2nd edition: Thick cardboard tiles, better (metal) wheel pin, player aids on thin cardboard - no flimsy stuff in the bo

This game is basically Le Havre with a positioning puzzle and a crapload of extra buildings, almost all of which get constructed, and in which it is really necessary to keep track of who has what building positioned where. Considering that the cards are so small, and that large numbers of chits (with two different sides) are strewn over the table, it is hard to see what your opponents are doing, or actually who is doing well. To me, this game is a paradigm for the "modern" game in which the designer supplies the players with hundreds of options and dozens of ways to score points, without much rhyme or reason, and then says: "you make your own fun with this mess." The mediocre design combined with the deplorable physical attributes make this one of the worst games I ever played. Definitely at the bottom of the Rosenberg-style games.

I've always been a fan of what Rosenberg has done with board games, especially the Harvest series of games. OeL is another one of those "gain resources; trade them for better resources; trade those better resources for points." While Le Havre and Loyang have felt distinctively different from Agricola (while still containing that Harvest nugget) both Caverna and OeL are amalgams (with OeL owing more to Le Havre than Agric). It's a solid game, with a good rondel mechanic to keep things tracked. Nice, expandy board, familiar conversion system, and little differences here and there. This isn't distinct enough from Le Havre that I think it's broken new ground; both Caverna and this one feel like Rosenberg has tried to make amends with aspects of his former games that he wished to improve on after publication. That being said, none of his originals feel outdated, nor do his fresh ones feel revolutionary. Rosenberg keeps doing his thing, and I'm fine with that, though I do wish for a new direction at some point.

This is a fairly complex game but a lot of fun to play. There's tons of paperwork in the game, but once you figure out what they're for it's very well organized. The game play itself is a puzzle when playing solo (which I have played) and if you can score 500 points you win. My first game was only 255 which was a horrible score, but getting there was just a whole lot of fun. You have so many choices for placing your pawns and taking your actions that you could go into analysis paralysis which is easy for me to do. It will have some replay value as solo for quite a few games since the building cards are two sided (giving you an Irish and French variant), but since the cards always come out the same initially I suspect it would have limitations once you figure the best route to the score. I wouldn't be surprised if someone has written down a list of moves to get there, but I'd hate to ruin the fun by looking that up, and it would be boring for me to sit down and optimize via the building book and all that. I'd rather just set up the game, and play from what I know and see how it goes for the fun of it. Whether I win or lose playing solo with this game makes a little difference, but isn't as important as playing it for fun. It is a complex box of delights for sure.

Mit første spil med Ora et Labora bekræfter mig i at Uwe Rosenberg har præsteret endnu en gang at lave et solidt spil. Jeg har ikke dyrket nogle af hans tidligere spil, men syntes ikke man kan komme udenom kvaliteterne i dem. Ora et Labora har på mange måder større potentiale for at blive en favorit hos mig end f.eks. Agricola, da de hemmelige kort ikke er en mekanisme, der tiltaler mig. Da vi endvidere formåede at spille spillet på den minimale tid, der var anslået allerede i vort første spil, er det et spil, der let vil kunne finde frem til bordet, når der er rum til et rigtigt spil på en hverdagsaften. Et spil med stort potentiale, der sagtens kan ende med en bedre vurdering end den jeg i første omgang vil tildele den.

Played first game last night, three players, "wine and bread" version.

First impression - wow!  It's like two of my favorite games, Le Havre and Agricola, had a beautiful child. ;-)

The resource dial works much better than Le Havre's ever-growing piles of tokens, and unlike Le Havre, you need to keep getting *some* basic materials up through the end of the game.

I both love, and find incredibly frustrating, the bushiness of the decision tree.  Lots of ways to go, but you always feel like maybe there was something better.

The only down side, for a first game, was not really having a good idea of what all the buildings did, and constantly looking over other players mats to see what options were available.

All in all, a great game.

Somewhat complex and fiddly game that isn't particularly intuitive, especially scoring.  Not a game I'm inclined to write off either.  Should appeal to fans of other Uwe Rosen games.  Conflict is very indirect, and you need to get familiar with many cards and their ordering, similar to Le Harve.

Very complex but incredibly fun.  Can be a tad too long, especially in 2 player game.  AP abounds, but you are often so focussed on your next move that you don't notice the zombie standing next to you.
Actually plays faster with 3-4 people than 2.  4 player game is fantastic, the one action and pass approach makes it move quickly so there isn't a ton of waiting, in fact I almost wish I had more time between actions because there are so many options and micro strategies that i am rarely ready when it's my time to play again.  Definitely need to laminate the player aids and get a box for all the billions of pieces.
Might be my favorite game right now.

Somewhere between Agricola and Le Havre, but closer to Le Havre, lays this excellent resource management game. If your colection is small and you already have Le Havre, may be Ora et Labora could wait a bit, but if it is big, or you love resource management games, this new design is one of the best picks yo could make. Ora et Labora is a trully superb game. The resource well makes it easier to handle, with less housekeeping than other Rosemberg´s games. Game mechanics are wise, well done and rewards good playing. I also think it is a good game for newbies but at the same time it demmands wise playing in order to achieve victory.  gentlemen, the best Uwe is back.

I think of Ora et Labora as "Improved Le Havre." It has a superior technology for allocating the available resources. It has an enjoyable spatial element that is missing in Le Havre. It has more interesting timing decisions because of the three pawns, and because of the need to clear land. It is a harder game to master than Le Havre. And finally and most importantly, it has a broader array of strategies and tactics to pursue.

In Le Havre, there were a variety of ways to approach the early game. But by the latter half of the game, they all will have evolved into a nearly identical endgame. Ora et Labora gives the players many more options than Le Havre, and this remains true all the way to the end of the game. For this reason, Ora et Labora seems to offer more variety from game to game. You would think it should offer less variety, since the setup is exactly the same every time, while Le Havre features some minor but important randomness in the setup. But that hasn't been my experience. The wealth of viable options in Ora et Labora creates different patterns and different challenges each time.

Like many of the other games from Rosenberg (particularly Agricola and Le Havre) this is about resource management with a lot of different ones present. The action selection system present in this game has many things in common with Le Havre, where you take a resource, use an action or build a building. However, the game does not seem to be as focused on one strategy (in Le Havre it is setting up for shipping large amount of quality goods at the end).

As I have rated Le Havre a perfect 10 and I do think this has even more to offer I cannot rate this any lower. Since my game group isn’t that interested in playing resource management games (with the exception of civilization games) I do not expect to play this one a lot, but I will certainly try to push for it.

Another hit from Uwe. The resource dial is a great way of dealing with accumulating resources and the wide variety of buildings and ways to score points mean that this game has a lot of options each turn. I wonder if it could get scripted at the beginning of the game but even if it does I think it would diverge fairly quickly after the first few rounds.

A caveat for the 2 player game: It can potentially never end. The game ends once there is only one building left to build. If one player (or both) is stupid and blocks themselves from being able to build cloister buildings then the game can carry on indefinitely.

Requires regular play to remember all the combos you can do. It's a good game, not as good as Agricola, but good nonetheless.
I got it brand new at a store for 40$ in my own language too, and I think I made a good investment (I don't think it's worth 60$ ++ though).

The game is deep enough to give you a high level of replayability (each game is different or different enough to get the feeling of not playing the same game as the last), and the decisions you take in the game will affect the outcome of the game for you. Not only for scoring, but placement of tiles and combos.

A game that must have been play-tested for hundreds of times, so well it is made.

I recommend this game to people who likes to build things and not having people coming their side and destroying their stuff.

A good thumb up!

This game is okay. I was a bit disapointed by the quality of the player boards and the included play-aids. They make no sense without laminating.
I played both, the long 2 player and the 3 player game. The 3 player game felt a bit 'cropped'. As soon as things began to work out, the game is over. I always have a feeling of an abrupt ending.
There's not so much player interaction, feels a bit like a solitaire.

Less obviously brutal than Agricola, but probably on par with Le Havre. I like the tech tree mechanic of sorts, where certain buildings definitely work with certain future buildings. It rewards several plays, especially because the flavor between Ireland and France varies, with France being a little more fiddly due to the extra good tile (grapes) yet somewhat more forgiving.
It is punishing in a sense-- you don't take loans or begging cards for not having food, but not building a settlement is really bad. But that sort o "reward" mentality is more palatable to many players.
I've yet to get a good grasp of the strategy, though I think I'm getting better at realizing the benefits of forcing others to place their workers rather than going pseudo-solitaire. 

Man, I just want to play this RIGHT NOW

RATING: 7
To me, this is a huge step from boring "Agricola". The game lets the player do whatever they want, without punishing them. I like that the whole game is a single board, since everyone can use any board, not just your own.

The only real downside to me, is the use of 18-22 (depending on the side you play) resources, which is just ridiculous! I'm very sure that one could half them and still get the very same feeling out of the game, maybe even more tense due to it.

But well, it is as it is and as it is, I won't put it into my shelf, even though I would play it again for sure.

The game has a lot in common with Le Havre.  Le Havre just takes too long for our group's taste, and I think this will end up falling in the same boat.  With experience, however, the game's play time could be shaved considerably.  The game becomes less cohesive as it goes along, with all the action spaces becoming spread out. Having to keep track of all the resources becomes a chore.  Quite well-designed, but just not up to par with Agricola and Caverna.  A bit too messy and sprawling.

A lighter version of agricola with some of the same ideas.  It is a resource management timing game where you are building an economic engine to create victory points through variable cards that come up for purchase.  The record keeping on the resources is taken care of with the wheel you see in photos of the game, which is a lot less fiddly than adding pieces to the piles in agricola.  

It has the same "grab it while the stack is tall" system for obtaining resources that you saw in agricola.  Its combined with a ton of variable cards which you add to the basic rooms to create a VP economy (hopefully).  My first game I managed to get a mill and a brewery.  A few lucky high wheat turns later and I was cranking out tons of beer which I used to finance a lot of expensive purchases later, even though I never really took a card that transformed the beer into victory points, I still came in a close second place by just using the beer to buy all kinds of different victory point related stuff that was available like settlements.  Another player built a building that turned fuel into victory points and a peat roaster that turned peat into coal.  That was a nice engine for him but he ended up building a wonder late that I think was a waste of his resources.  Overall this part of the game was very fun and very interesting to me.  It reminds me a lot of the fun part of agricola, only without nearly as many of the "how do I do X" moments.

It also unfortunately has almost no interaction, which was my biggest gripe about agricola and is my biggest gripe about this game.  You compete somewhat for the cards in the marketplace, but there isn't really much of an effect on any other player's position.  This criticism of the game should be taken with a grain of salt, because we did not take advantage of the fact that you can use other people's workers.  We were so caught up in other things no one did it.

I'm also not in love with the fact that card placement in your tableau makes for so many points, when it doesn't really feel like that is part of the economic engine building that is the strength of the game.  I suspect that little gripe was the result of only playing once and that in future games, I will understand whats going on with the strategic placement of the cards a little better and enjoy it more.

This is a bad game for me, because there are so many cards to learn about that my brain ends up getting lost in the forest of possibilities.  It's worse than Le Havre and even Caylus in that respect -- each building breaks the rules in a different way, and costs a different set of resources, so there are way too many things to consider.  It's even worse given that you can use other players' buildings for one gold.  That makes it impossible to play simultaneously -- you have to wait until the previous player has decided what building they will use (or whether they will use your last pawn so that you can't use it at all, which can really wreak havoc on your plans).

I also dislike the fact that a winning score is about 200 points -- it's hard for me to grasp scores that big.

I think this is a game without randomness, much like Caylus... but I don't think that's a good thing.

If you like Rosenberg's heavier gamer offerings, this should appeal to you. Me, I often find them just a tad bit on the complex side for my taste. There's a lot to take in here, and it all seems balanced at first blush, so your choices are myriad. There are several ways to score, and at least 8 types of goods that you'll have to use as currency for buildings, settlements, and other goods and VP items. Finding the combos and coming up with a decent engine will require some analysis.

The big wheel is the central mechanism, and it works very well in the good old Puerto Rico way-- choices which are left unselected become more and more valuable until someone can no longer resist. Like similar mechanics in games past, it's a very clever way to add tension to a game. Should you get that pile of stone now or wait a turn for a bigger pile, taking the risk of someone else grabbing it first? I wonder if a simpler, more elegant game could be made from this one basic idea. Hmm...

As for the rest of the game, buy up lots of special action buildings, put your workers on them, collect resources to trade for other resources, to build more buildings and special scoring areas, and so on. You can also take opponents' actions and waste their workers for a pittance... this can really hose their plans, and was the weakest part of the game for me. I'm sure it was added as a nod to player interaction, but I felt the game would have been fine leaving players to run their own little engines without outside interference. Still, it's a little bit friendlier than Agricola... despite its food and fuel gathering, there is no punitive phase where you must pay up or face consequences. There are special building phases you'll want to be ready for, but they aren't nearly as common and not building every time won't kill your game.

Overall, not a bad game, but I would have been happy with a much more paired down design. The wheel mechanism is great, but really just a new face on an old idea, and the rest of it we've seen elsewhere. For those players that want to plumb its depths, I suspect Ora & Labora may have quite a bit of replayability. As for me, I'll play it on occasion until it loses its luster around here, which I suspect won't take long.

This is a very impressive game, which take Rosenberg's (2) biggest triumphs, blends the best flavours, and comes up with a pleasant confection indeed.

Ora & Labora (O&L) has the tableau building and rural themes of Agricola, but the (slightly) kinder goods accumulation and availability of Le Havre, and has a feel of constructive building more like the latter game on a 1st impression.

Like Agricola and Le Havre it has very specific cards to better suit play for various numbers of gamers, well-written and complete rules (though sometimes a little hard to find specific rules, they were generally clear enough for me to recall having read a rule... now where was it again?), and nice graphics which delineate the play.  It has user-specific builds, timing issues, and resource collection vs. other critical action conflicts.

O&L does not have a mandatory chow call, which I think is a nice change.  The theme of medieval life still carries though pretty well.

The boards/sheets are flimsier than in previous games, but it also packs better into the box, and seems lighter than predecessor games with more "cardboard/wood goodness".

On the whole, the game play was very satisfying.  Like Agricola and Le Havre on the 1st play I made many rules mistakes, but generally caught them by the end of the game.

I think the play flowed quite well, and had a "kinder, gentler" feel which suited the monks' non-agressive/acquisitive stance.

It was hard to give an initial rating, but I LIKED this game more than Agricola or Le Havre; I had to rate it better than either, so it starts at an 8 on a 1st play, with room to slide or to climb from there.

I definitely look forward to more plays of this, soon!

This game offers a very good combination of spatial development and process management. Most victory points will usually be made with the buildings and settlement tiles in your fief. Especially the settlements, scoring only horizontally and vertically adjacent buildings, need careful planning. As a third layer, one also needs to focus on ressources and production chains for goods and victory point tiles. Due to the latter ORA ET LABORA is similar to LE HAVRE, due to the first it feels related to AGRICOLA. A combination I like a lot. Playing time easily exceeds 2 hours but is worth every minute spent if you are looking for cleverly interwoven development and ressource management mechanisms.

Although you mainly plan your own development, interaction with other players is nicely integrated not only with timing issues for ressource collection and aquisitions of buildings. One can also pay other players to use one of their pawns in one of their buildings for one's own benefit. Neat little needle-picks here.

Very much a game in the designer's usual mould, and one I avoided playing for as long as possible as I'm no fan of Le Havre. Like Agricola every possible option is thrown on to the cards with little regard for coherent combos. This game is purely an exercise in action efficiency, you're tempted by the bigger piles of resources, you build what you can afford, but it's only marginally less efficient to use another player's building than your own, so who cares what you build? I really feel that Euros are a design dead end now. I'm losing patience with get this, convert to that, build the other and that's strictly what's on offer here.

RATING: 8
I like it! It's quite similar to Le Havre, but I think it's more streamlined.  There's often a point in the middle of Le Havre when I am not sure what direction I should be going and don't have a good view of the game as a whole. I don't know if O&L really solves that problem, but I don't feel it as much, and it's a little easier to create generative loops. It's still a little tricky to keep track of all the powers, especially with the tiny little cards, but I really dig the powers, and the spatial aspect of the game is cool, as is the ability to control the size of a player's plot.  Fun.  (3 plays)

ºAdquisición de recursos, situación y utilización de edificios y asentamientos y colocación de trabajadores ambientados en los monasterios europeos de la edad media.

Si Le Havre se hubera casado con Agricola: Bosques y Cenagales, este hubiera sido su hijo, porque se parece a ambos y, en algunos aspectos pule y mejora detalles de su diseño haciendo un juego más abierto y con muchísimas opciones. Genialidades a destacar: el rondel para la distribución de recursos (elimina la farragosa tarea de reponerlos), la variable de la "situación espacial" de los edificios que constuyes (ahora además de pensar qué construyes hay que tener en cuenta en dónde lo haces), los recursos no se vuelven inútiles conforme avanza la partida (estoy pensando en la arcilla de LH y en la madera de Agricola) y además tiene dos escenarios: Irlanda y Francia. Nada de azar, exceptuando el sorteo para determinar el jugador inicial (no sé si esto es bueno o malo... podría resultar en que a veces jugaras la misma partida una y otra vez) CONS: Tiende al A/P y las cartas (parte fundamental del juego) son extraordinariamente pequeñas. Y su precio. Caro. De. Narices.

Resources managment, planning the placement of buildings and how to use them, worker placement with a setting about medieval monastery of Europe.

If Le Havre had married Farmers of the Moor, Ora et Labora would have been be their son because is similar to both. It polish some aspects of their desings doing a more open-ending game with a lot of options. Outstandings detalis about it desing are: the rondel (wheel) to manage resources in the board (it eliminates the knotty task of resource replacement), adds the spatial situation when you build (now you´ve more things to do, not only what to build but where you ´ll constuct it). Goods are not useless at the final game (yes; I´m thinking on Le Havre´s clay and Agricola´s wood). Finally, it also includes two different scenarios: Ireland and France.

There´s no luck except the first player draw, but I don´t know if this is good or bad, becouse it could happen you´ll play several identical games. CONS AP+, extremely little cards. Price. Real expensive game.

The most similar game from the Rosenberg's portfolio would be Le Havre.

It's generally good if you need several plays to get a good control over the game.  But here it almost crosses the line.  After 10+ plays I _still_ have a feeling that I need to play OeL at least once week to be any good at it...
There are so many possibilities and things to do here that prioritization, setting and following a strict path are extremely hard.  Fully conscious play is difficult.  Usually you want to do too much.

To sum up: Rosenberg in good, old shape, but don't expect anything revolutionary here.  Rondel is merely a technical solution and spacing of buildings / using opponents' workers are nice, but not ground breaking concepts.

Rating will go up ONLY if I achieve better control over my play.

Still, all above remarks aside, Agricola and Le Havre seem better...

--

3-player mode is significantly better than 4-player one.  More actions (you can achieve more) and more control. 
 And don't try 2-player mode.

Like most Rosenberg games I'm getting most of my enjoyment by doing cool/fun stuff, but the key difference is in this one I felt like I was being rewarded for doing the things I already wanted to be doing. The mechanics themselves are pretty straightforward and nothing too special but they do a good job of evoking the theme. My one concern is that the 3 and 4 player experience seems different enough that I have no idea how much I'd like it just based on how much I liked it at 2.

I like this slightly better than Le Havre--there's more of a feel of purpose--while I am trying max out VPs, I do feel like I'm building up my religious order (or whatever the precise term is.) 

The mechanisms are smooth and well thought-out. Neat buildings and components. I like expanding the countryside and planning out where to put things.

But, like Le Havre, the combination of never-ending turning-things-into-other-things along with having to be aware of everyone ELSE's board is just too much to be truly enjoyable.
 
Game is prone to AP as it progresses.

RATING: 6
It was a good experience for once, but I have no intention of replaying it until I know all the buildings. It was hard enough to learn all the goods.

It is typical that you have some wine at the end of the game and you walk around the table to find a good building somewhere else to use.

It would quickly become an analysis paralysis game if you'd want to play it well.

RATING: 7
After a couple of 2-player games: Fun game, resource conversion overload.  Slightly unsatisfying endgame after final buildings come out and the game suddenly shifts to VP generation rather than engine building.

Strangely reminiscent of Homesteaders (resources, buildings that appear in stages), minus the exciting auctions. :)

So far a satisfactory gaming experience, time will tell whether the game has any longevity.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (May 2015)

Uwe Rosenberg is one of my favorite game designers, so I always expect a lot from his games. Happily, Ora et Labora is a very good gamer's game :).

The game comes with lots and lots of components, sadly, many of them were damaged when I punched them. Also the player boards are very flimsy. I'm thinking about laminating them. 

The rules were easier than I expected but the decisions in the game are far from obvious due to the sheer number of buildings. Each building has a cost and an effect but you also have to take into account where to build it (strong spatial element) and the type of terrain in which you can build it. It it's great :D.

Ora et Labora comes with excellent (and vital) player aids. 

The resource wheel is very well done and does an excellent work tracking the resources and the game rounds. I think this was the first game in which Rosenberg used it but I already played other games with it (Le Havre: The Inland Port and Glass Road).

It comes with two variants (France and Ireland) that have different resources and cards. Very neat. So far I can't really compare them because I have only played Ireland. 

I was worried that the static setup could lead to a low replay value, but my gut feeling is telling me each game will be different. The are just too many options with the buildings.

I'm indifferent towards the theme, but I have to say many buildings feel very thematic. 

On the bad side, I think the cards are too small so you can't see them clearly across the table. Also, it came with lots of manuals (I think four?) and as I read the rules almost exclusively on the iPad I couldn't find all of them. However, this is a very minor dislike.

It was very expensive for me, but this week I heard about an upcoming reprint. 

Bottom line, Ora et Labora is a very good resource conversion game. Very reminiscent of both Le Havre (resource conversion) and Le Havre: The Inland Port, but much more closer to the latter. It has a lot of potential and I want to play it again soon.

One of 2011`s favorites.

RATING: 10
Ora et Labora is largely a reimagining of Le Havre.  That’s not a bad thing.  Le Havre is a great game.

The game flow is similar.  Each player gets one action per turn, with the start player getting a second action.  Since each player is start player an equal number of times there are an equal number of actions per player, with each player getting a fair chance at the greater basic item offers.

Even though the game flows similarly there are major differences which make Ora et Labora more than simply another version of the same game.  Players build buildings on their own game board, and the spatial arrangement is important.  One of the major sources of victory points at game end is settlement value.  Each building has both an intrinsic building value and a settlement value; the settlement value only scores if the building is next to a settlement.  Some buildings are more desirable to have near settlements - vineyards are pleasant to be next to and have high settlement values, but no one wants to be near the slaughterhouse.

The goods conversions are more streamlined; Ora et Labora eliminates the Shipping Line from Le Havre, instead making several goods intrinsically worth points. Another aspect different from Le Havre is the workers.  While in Le Havre each player has one worker who moves from building to building, in Ora the players have 2-3 workers who work only their buildings.  Opponents can donate coins to get other players’ workers to work opponents’ buildings for them - or later in the game, they can ply the opposing monks with whiskey or wine instead.  When at the beginning of a turn all workers are spent, they return to the player’s supply for future use.  In addition the prior is a special worker who can activate a building immediately after it has been built; it is important to make the most of these bonus actions.

Where Ora really distinguishes itself is the spatial aspect.  Settlements serve as the upkeep of the game; the penalty for not having enough food and fuel is to miss out on these important VP opportunities.  Arranging one’s buildings optimally can be an engrossing puzzle for the first few games, irrespective of what other players are doing.

Adding to replayability is that there are two different building sets and slightly different goods, corresponding to France and Ireland themes.  The game has obvious expansion possibilities in new goods tiles and building cards for different country themes - though I did like Agricola Farmers of the Moor it’s nice to see that this game can be expanded without an additional layer of rules complexity.

Ora et Labora might be the equal or even superior of Uwe Rosenberg’s two top 10 entries Agricola and Le Havre.   I plan on playing 20+ times to find out.

Considering how much I paid... the components are a disappointment.  Thin stock sheets, sub-par counters, warp-prone boards, and cardboard wheels that have to be taken apart every time you play with different numbers of players (a real pain in the ass!).

However, once you get past the cheapness of the components... there is a pretty good game here.

After playing through the solo game a few times, my rating has gone up from 7 to 9.  I have yet to play with more players, but if the experience is half as strong as the solo play, I think I'm going to love it.  This game may make it to a '10' rating yet...

RATING: 8.5
An evolution of Le Havre which is no bad thing. The resource dial is great and makes the game far less fiddly plus the addition of the spatial element is a nice touch. Personally I don't think the lack of a random setup is a problem but the size of the cards is. Constantly having to peer closely at each one (both yours but especially those of other players) adds to the AP. And don't get me started on the quality of some of the components. For a game that's steeply priced I expect it to be better. Let's hope this is a one-off for Lookout games and not a worrying trend. That's just nit-picking though. This is a great game and a worthy sibling to both Agricola and Le Havre.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Wow. Incredibly elegant, large decision space, and I adore the theme. It's a shortened version of Le Havre with the fuel and food and spatial element from Farmers of the Moor with some new twists and a vastly improved resource incrementation method. This is a real winner. I'll probably do a review after some additional plays. Thanks Uwe!

UPDATE 2:  After a few more plays, OK is where I'm staying on Ora.  The component size and quality is a distraction, especially since players are obliged to constantly be checking out what everyone else at the table has.  Ora isn't a bad games, but there are plenty of games in my collection I'd rather play.

UPDATE:  After a few plays OEL is OK.  I want to get more games in before assigning a rating, but while I like the game to some degree, I don't think it's as good as Agricola.

The component size and quality still drives me crazy.  I also miss the variability of the Agricola Occupations/Minor Improvements.  I do like the ability to use opponent's buildings in OEL.


First impression:  cheap crummy components.  Numerous resource tiles ripped as they were cut out with an exacto knife.  The resource wheel even ripped a little when I popped out the tiny hole in the middle. The cards are very small. This is the same company that put out Agricola?

RATING: 6
Good game for sure, but I think I may be burning out on Uwe games (after Agricola, Bohnanza, Glass Road, Fields of Arle, All Creatures Big and Small, Le Havre, Le Havre Inland Port, and Patchwork). The spatial aspect is interesting, and I enjoyed both the solo and 2-player games. I want to try this with 3 and 4 players soon. 

I fear this game lacks both tension and variety, and the theme does not do much for me (which is ironic since I usually love Uwe's themes, and this one is not that different than Agricola or Fields of Arle). For some reason I cannot quite identify, I do not find myself desiring to play this game. I feel like the choices are just not difficult or interesting, and in a game of this length, I really want to be challenged.

Possibly my favorite Rosenberg game all about collecting converting resources. There are so many buildings, especially in a 4 player game, that the choices seem overwhelming.  The amount of options provides a lot of appeal though, and as they come out of the course of the game it provides a nice arc.  The spatial aspect adds another layer of interesting decisions.

So many chits, on first sight this game looks like a war game :p. The dial mechanism is interesting and brings some tension into the game. Twenty different resources and ways to convert them felt convoluted. I liked the deterministic nature of this game, however all the combined buildings and action to choose from; especially in the end game, felt very heavy...dare I say: too much? That might get better with repeated plays, but the lengthiness of this game tempers the urge to sit down and play this optimisation challenge again.

In Le Havre, the goods were delivered by ships, and they increased until they were bought.  This does not work at all for forests which should growing.  How is it that the amount of wood MY forest produces suddenly decreases if the player before me chops THEIR forest down?  That is stupid.  Other than that, Ora et Labora is a less tight version of Le Havre.  I like Le Havre better, because (a) the silly spacial thing is not there, (b) the cards and text size are not so small.

The game is very fiddly and will take repeated plays to get to a point where strategy actually occurs. I'm not sure that the game is fun (at all) enough to justify the required plays (and long play time).

Also - for the cost the components are terrible.

Also - 3 hours bent over tiny cards, trying to optimise your resource conversions... just not a good game.

Ora et Labora is the true third part of the harvest trilogy. There are two notable differences to Agricola/Le Havre. First, there's no single random element (no cards). Second, due to the clever turn wheel there's no need to refill all resources every turn. Still, it's a three hour game. 
The biggest problem of Ora et Labora is it's late birth. While I enjoyed it as much as Le Havre, it's basically more of the same and I'm not playing enough Agricola or Le Havre to warrant a purchase. In fact, Ora et Labora brought me to downgrading Le Havre to a 7 as I've recognized that due to their length and lots of competition in their niche I never will play these games enough to get the full potential out of them and on an occasional play too much is lost to rate them higher.

Surprised this is so popular. I love the production wheel as a new mechanic, but trying to figure out what the most efficient set of actions that can generate me the most points for my N actions while hosing my neighbor out of points and still managing my settlements for optimal points seems overwhelming. I like heavy games, but this game makes me really appreciate Agricola, which gives very fixed point rewards for goals (1 grain? 1 point. 4 grain? 2 points). Here, everything is worth points and the possibilities are overwhelming. Very subject to AP.

Played it twice and it is officially on my "never need to play that again" list. I don't need to play a 3-4 hour game whose main outcome is a bunch of well-optimized settlements. Counter to the opinions of most, this game feels to me like a lot of throwing mechanics at the wall and seeing what sticks as opposed to a refinement of his previous gamer games. I really don't find the mechanic of your workers staying on the board until you start your turn with all of them on the board. Considering how far in advance you have to plan your actions the potential "take that" aspect of somebody else making you play your monk somewhere other than the place that you have been working many turns toward is simply a failure in terms of creating a cohesive game.

A very positive first impression, hoping my opinion improves with further play.

I like the resource wheel and the underlying game feels very much like the Rosenberg predecessors which I have also enjoyed.

Still wondering if this is different enough to warrant playing over Le Havre, and just like Le Havre, playing time is a definite minus.  I can see the play time coming down a little bit, but probably not enough to make it one that we play all the time.  I'd like to see it at under an hour and a half.  At more than two hours I'm not so willing.

A game in the vein of Agricola and Le Havre, mechanically perhaps closer to latter and thematically to the first. It is friendlier than the aforementioned games because of the lack of the feeding phase and although you still compete to get the buildings and can use others' buildings there is a slight feeling of multiplayer solitaire. Probably needs new country expansions in the long run to keep it interesting.

Excellent resource transformation game. The tile placement makes it different from other heavy Uwe's in that position really matters for both the agglomerations and the terrain types. That being said, it is still too familiar to Le Havre for my taste, and I prefer the latter.

Alcoholic monks play at shuffling commodities around the port of Le Havre, except it's really a bit of countryside with a spatial element (for the locations, not the commodities). The game feels less intuitive and more fussy, at least to a newcomer. The need to coordinate your building placements and available resources for each settlement phase (really an inverted feeding phase) as well as for the final building opportunities means that good play involves planning and re-planning your boards and actions early, often and very carefully. My first game was plagued by false options, lack of overview and beginner mistakes, so further play is needed for proper evaluation. I suppose some of the elements that felt awkward, like keeping track of available options on other player boards, quickly get better with experience.

After one play, anyway, this is not really my thing. I might play it occasionally in the future, but I doubt I'll buy it unless I have a real change of heart.

Here's the deal. This game suffers not from a lack of player aids, but from a lack of the right kind of player aids.

Imagine a game where a red cube and a blue cube combine to make a purple cube. You need purple cubes to win. Great! You've just played Fresco.

Now imagine a game where you have fish that you've caught and you have to flip to the Smoked Herring side in order to eat them. Great! You've just played Le Havre.

Now imagine you have seven or eight goods, they can all get flipped (one without even taking an action... just don't flip it back) but in order to do so you have to combine good A with good B, sometimes with good E to get good F or to get 30 victory points. You can also combine good A with good D to get good G (which is really good E, flipped). And so on. Congratulations! You've played Ora et Labora.

This isn't a linear set of conversions, it's a web. The web doesn't appear as such on the player aid. For numbskulls such as myself, Ora et Labora is just way too unintuitive. It feels like at the end of the day, you could just be trading up cubes in a long chain from red through green, yellow, purple, puce, mauve, burnt umber, and tangerine all the way through to the holy grail of beige. The sequence can double back on itself and there's nothing as self evident as live fish -> smoked herring or clay -> brick.

I really enjoyed the building placement aspect, which I gamed carefully enough to fall just four points short of the ultimate victor. It didn't take a whole lot. Mostly I just grabbed goods when there were plenty, bought expensive buildings, and made a long chain of settlements. That was straightforward. But the production end of the game - which is where you score the really serious veeps - completely lost me somewhere between peat and whisky.

It's fussy, and yet open-ended. And while open-endedness is usually something I admire in a game, in Ora, there are so many options that it's really hard to know what to do. This might resolve itself over several plays, but given the complexity of the web and its interactions with the dozens of buildings involved, I'm not sure I have it in me to invest the time. 

The game comes with two very different games in the box - you can play with France or with Ireland, and how cool is that? Expansions could add even more - you could spend a bunch of grain to grab a handful of buildings that only you could build, or you could build a thieves' guild that allows you to snatch stone from a neighbor. I mean, the possibilities are endless. But they could involve even less intuitive relationships, in which case, no thanks.

Just plain fun.  The time really flies when my wife and I played it for the first time.  I was worried that this would take a long time to play, similar to Le Havre.  So much to think about, that it almost makes you wish there was more downtime when its not your time to plan what to do.  I am a little worried about re-playability with the same setup every game, but there is just so much to do, so many paths.

Might just make it up to my second favourite owned game soon.  I just need to play it some more.

For some reason this one doesn't work for me. I played 2p only (the short version with less cards,) so this might be it, but I don't think so. For one, there is really only one way to place the cards you buy so as to earn maximum points, and you discover this very quickly, so the "build your own landscape" aspect ends-up always the same from game to game. Then there is the Beer problem. Making Beer looks like fun, with so many cards involved with Beer, except that it is impossible to make more than a few barrels as it requires way too many resources and steps - and forget making lots of Whiskey. Wine is much easier to make but of course it's not worth much. And scoring is so complicated, you need a pocket calculator. I'm surprised this is ranked so high...

Fun game.  I like it and really want to play it again.  I see the similarities to Le Havre but this game seems a bit sloppier.  Although I might just prefer the theme of this one over Le Havre's, I think Le Havre is the better game.

Unfortunately, this game doesn’t improve on the one logistical complaint I have with Le Havre (the difficulty in reading/seeing the buildings of other players).  In Le Havre I can mitigate this by having a central common building display area with colored markers to indicate who owns the building.  This fix is impossible in Ora because the spatial positioning of buildings on each separate player board is critical to game play.

The resource wheel is a neat mechanism.  It's duplicated (twice) in the upcoming Glass Road from the same designer.

This game takes just as long to play as Le Havre.  Anyone thinking this was going to be more of the same but with a shorter play time will be disappointed.

Finally, there has been some debate about the component quality.  I only recognized this with the thickness of the player boards and extensions.  Yes they are thin and it would be nicer if they were thicker.  However, it is not really noticed during game play.

Overall, I like this game and definitely want to play it more.  But I think Le Havre is better, followed by Ora, with Agricola a distant third.  But for now, I'll forgo purchasing it (due to the spatial concern) until I can try Glass Road and Caverna (okay, done; if I could find this at a decent price I would buy it).

Excellent game, it offers fun in planning & developing your board, and provides lots of in-game atmosphere, as well as strategy along with tactics. 

It also manages to be quite accessible in use, though I held off reading the rules myself until I had the opportunity to be taught the game by someone with previous experience, something I now regret.

Guess I should get around to trying out Le Havre now, as Uwe really delivered with Ora et Labora :)

My favourite euro. Beats Le Havre and Power Grid, because I love its theme, very well implemented, and its gameplay. It's not as tense as the other two, so the games are a lot more fun. There are so many choices in every turn that you have plenty of scope to try new things in every game without being severely punished for that.
Love it.

Slots somewhere between Agricola and Le Havre for this kind of worker placement resource optimization exercise.

I find this one more "pleasant" (read - less cutthroat feeling) than either, and certainly it seems more like you're trying to score lots of points rather than avoid lots of penalties - an incentive I tend not to like.

Quite good. At the moment, if given the choice between the three, I would take Ora et Labora.

For me this is tough to rate after one game.
Basicly it is resource worker placement conversion games with some tqbleau building You trade resources for buildings and these buildings give you resources 

Now I think it is a 7 . Both friends I have played this with think highly of it.
I give it a bit more because of the tableau building.

I am not sure if this is 4 player game.
The three player game was perfect. We all had 33 actions. In the four player game this will be 25 unless I missed something.
Scores were high but not so far apart. I had 234, 208 and 203.
My tableau building won me the game.  I had a 68 point difference with the player who scored the second highest.
There are a ton of points to be made in resource conversion into VP . I only scored 16 points there. The best was 54 but there was one building were the sum of the resources was 40 after conversion.

To round of my thoughts this is an excellent game in the genre but if you own a few you probably own enough.

Haven't made my mind up fully yet, but first impressions aren;t great. At the moment it is another resource management game (which is what I love) but lacks the solidness of Agricola or the clear directionality of Le Havre. It does not help that it comes with poor quality components which have ruined a game which could have been a contender. The biggest problem with the game is the player boards which are thin card and warp (mine were already warped when I opened the box for the first time!!!) making balancing cards on them irritatingly awkward. My advice is await a reprint with thicker boards and buy/stick with Agricola.

Played once, 4p.  Hmmm...  Did not really live up to my (admittedly high) expectations.  I think there may be one layer too many of things going on.  Too many resources, too many ways to exchange resources, too many ways to convert to victory points, and too many different buildings to keep track of.  It is also possible to completely screw somebody accidentally (forcing them to use their last worker, leaving them with nothing remotely useful to do, essentially giving them a big victory point hit) - not sure what the point of that is.  At this point, Le Havre is still the preferred game, but I LOVE the resource wheel mechanism.  I think the game is maybe a bit too fiddly, and scaling back the fiddliness but keeping the resource wheel would make for a great game.

A long (3h+) deep euro in the purest Rosenberg tradition.  Mechanically it feels a lot like Le Havre without the feeding & ship, but with slightly more meaningful player interactions and a lot more viable options at any given point.  That makes for a more open, slightly more forgiving play which isn't a bad thing for a game this long.  The flow is fairly good and it scales a touch better than Le Havre (which I only ever really play with 3 nowadays).  On the surface, it's also reminiscent of Agricola with the building grids on the player mat, but that's a fairly weak relationship.  All in all it's a solid entry is a genre that's already fairly crowded.  Fans of the designer will want to own this one too.  Like its siblings, this game has a lot to offer to the right crowd with sufficient time to invest (which is easier said than done).

Your first game is likely to be as long and painful as your first game of Le Havre...especially if everyone is new.  The cards are small and one can easily just get caught up in doing what is in front of you (which is ideal if the machine is generating points).  I liked the resource rondel which really keeps the resource accounting more simple as to what is available to select.  Mind you, you will still have a ton of chits in front of you to try and bend into points in some fashion.  For once, it was also nice not to have to worry about feeding your people ALTHOUGH you still want to acquire a fair amount of food to build the better settlements if possible.  I also liked the aspect that there are two variants as there is a French variant and an Irish variant where a couple resources change and the buildings act differently.  The player aids were effective but I wasn't impressed in the quality of the paper used - might need to laminate those.  I also would have preferred cardboard terrain as the cardstock tends to warp a little.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another strong meaty Euro game from Uwe Rosenberg.  I enjoy not having the pressure of feeding because it allows for a more free-form approach to the purchasing of buildings that form useful combinations with one another.  There seem to be many ways to direct one's efforts and earn VPs.  I have used a fairly balanced strategy so far, gaining Vps from high point buildings, setlements and resources/wonders but could see focusing more on one or two elements in the future.

I should start by saying that I really dislike Agricola. Le Havre I like a little better, but the agonizing microsteps of every single action drive me insane. As a result, I wasn't expecting too much from Ora et Labora, since it seemed to be much of the same.

Turns out, it pretty much is. It's a little better in that the basic resources actually are basic resources and not pre-resources you need to convert into actual resources to get anything done. But there's still the same bizarreness that if someone chops down trees before I do, I get fewer of them. 

I'm still not a fan of this stuff, but if I had to play one of the three, I guess it would be this one? It's really not an appealing choice to make.

After our first play, not sure what to make of it yet. Want to play again.

Our way of approaching any game is to let the game surprise you the first play. No looking through cards before the game. This hampers strategic play, but makes the first game exploratory along the lines of "What does this button do".

I'm not sure whether I like the abundance of choices. I felt AP crawling up my leg. It seems there are several ways to play this. Either tactical (my innate preference) or strategic. Tactical here means just wait and see what is left to do and rate choices in terms of efficiency. strategic means calculating the actions left to you until the next village building fase. I think being able to switch between tactical and strategic is key here.

Strategic placement plays a big role. And that is an interesting addition to the Agricola-like harvest theme. 
Having to buy land to build on, also very nice.

This is probably a game for which I have to be in the right mood. Sometimes I'm just too tired/lazy to think strategically.

Surprisingly accessible with easy setup and execution. Gameplay moves quickly because players have several reasonable buildings/actions available and rarely get stymied.  The oft frowned-upon feeding mechanic is presented in Ora as a bonus round that feels less punitive than Agricola or Le Havre. One negative is that it can feel a bit scripted.

Uwe Rosenberg game where you gather resources to build buildings which provide special abilities.  Building placement is very important as it provides substantial end of game scores.  The game has a number of economic paths to victory.  Monastery buildings provide special abilities that give you benefits in game.  

You can also use other players buildings by paying a gold or or wine or beer.  

Overall, the spatial element is very interesting and adds an interesting dimension to game play.  

I view this as and excellent game and put it right up with Le Havre, At the Gates of Loyang and Caverna. Agricola is in its own amazing class of greatness.

After six plays (all with the Ireland variant), I was still feeling my way round this game.  With multiple ways to score and so many paths to take to score goods and so many ways to arrange buildings and settlements to get the best scores from them, it's overwhelming.  I'm only starting to devise some strategies and am playing each turn with more in mind of an overall strategy than just grabbing/activating something that looks good for that turn and that turn alone.  For some reason, it reminds me a bit of [b][thing=66362][/thing][/b] due to theme, the spacial element and the goods conversion, but it is so much heavier a game.

A solid effort from Uwe Rosenberg, but not as good as Agricola or Le Havre. Technically, there are far more strategic pathways to take in this game, and the incremental improvement over Le Havre with the inclusion of the resource wheel, plus the return of tile placement from Agricola should all make for a great game, but something's missing. It could be that there are so many ways to convert different resources that it never really feels like you get an efficient engine going... the final turns of Ora et Labora seem to lack the feeling of things finally falling into place that made Agricola and Le Havre so satisfying. Of course, that could just be my inexperience with the game talking; time will tell.

The rondel is a great way to take care of resources and I love building up my little town.  Also like the choice of playing France or Ireland.  Will probably become a perfect 10 with more plays!

I don't know what to think of this game. There is a mountain of resource chits coming at you and you can build dozens of buildings, most of which convert a resource (or combination thereof) into another resource (or combination thereof).

I will probably like Ora et Labora better after a few more sessions, when I have learned some of the basic building functionality and combos.
Nice that you can earn so many extra points from placing your buildings in a certain pattern, this is another advantage for OeL.

First session was a little bit confusing and the question is if I will give OeL the attention for many more sessions?

Also, building new builings seems to pay off better in VP´s than using buildings ability to generate VP. Could be that I didn´t saw any good combos, but that was the general impression I got after playing the first session.

2er and 1er's only, so far.

Utterly static set-up that has so far prevented solo-gamers from embracing this lovely game.

Using a twist from a scenario from The Colonists, this might work:  keep turn order for two opponents and place their workers on newly bought buildings.

EDIT:  I join the chorus of wondering why Mr. Rosenberg didn't create more country settings for this.  This game is so far in the rear-view mirror that it's likely never going to happen.

I appreciate a few things about this game.  I think the wheel is a pretty good idea.  (Might be kind of cool to see Le Havre redone with this wheel so you wouldn't have to stock everything up all the time.)  But I don't know, it's just a bit too much to process for me.  Love Agricola.  Enjoy Le Havre.  But this one kind of feels like elements from some of his previous games were unnecessarily mixed and complicated for this one.  I appreciate the design, and understand why some people like it, but it's just too much for me - too many buildings, too many resources (which) turn into too many other resources, too many options to choose from.

And I liked the theme a lot, It's more appealing for me than Agricola's theme.

[b]Components.[/b] Some of my chits ripped, boards too thin, cards smaller than I'd like.
[b]Rulebook(s).[/b] They needed a simpler way to explain this game.  I was totally turned off by this and had to watch a video on BGG to learn how to play!  Rulebook focuses on 3-4 players, which is frustrating when you almost always play with two.
[b]Complexity.[/b]  More options per turn than Agricola, and the complexity increases over the course of the game (this could be a pro depending on what you like in your games).


I've only played a couple games, but I've had fun with this so far and think it's actually a very good game.  It's so complex, though, that I don't think I'll get to play it as often as I like (my husband doesn't like the expanding complexity).

[i]Sold, as Le Havre does a better job at everything this game tries to do.  Also it has bigger cards![/i]

Have only played the 2 player game so far, but I absolutely love it.  Lots of things to be aware of, and so many things to plan for with very restrictive worker placement means you can barely do half the things you want to do but have to rationalise with the resources available.

With so much going on the game can take a while when players really think about their moves.  Shorter versions take a while too. It means that it doesn't get played as much as I would like, but whenever we do play it it's enthralling.

RATING: 8
Holy cow! How many things can a game introduce at the same time for you to decide on?? If one is used to the nihilistic attitude of Agricola, this game will be the kinder big brother. Tons of decisions to make. Actually there are so many, it is hard to tell which ones are the good ones. A pretty decent game, though it could be daunting to new gamers.

RATING: 8
Construct and use buildings to gain and convert a wide range of resources (initially building materials, then food and fuel for settlements, then victory points). The official solo game is straight puzzle (no luck at all), but introducing a dummy player means having to adjust strategy as you go. Too long and complex to persuade others to join me.

RATING: N/A
fairly easy game to explain (except for maybe the settlements); take your action to essentially do one of three things (play a clergyman, cut peat/trees or build a building).
However, each building built (by each player) adds another potential action space to the game for all players, so by the end, the choices were a little overwhelming on the first play.  I still really enjoyed and looking forward to trying it again

RATING: 6.5
Very heavy, hard to learn and hard to master, but very thematic and interesting game. Uwe does what he does best, brings stories to victorypoint euros. Production wheel is cool but it's still incredibly fiddly game. There's more freedom and slightly more immersive theme than in Le Havre. Static setup is a shame, but I don't think it's a game that's meant to be played often. Great components and clear rulebook.

2-Player Comment:
* Like most Uwe games, Ora et Labora is great with two.

RATING: 5
Production circle is very innovative and I like it. The game has much in common with Le Havre, is a little bit simpler, but still very heavy - for gamers only. I am not a fun of games of that kind. However the theme of Le Havre suits me much better than this. It is another kind of sophisticated solitaire with almost none interaction between players, which I've tried after Essen 2011 fair hits: Dungeon Petz and Last Will. Enough for me.

I'm not fluent in French, but I believe that translated this game is called [i]Long and Boring[/i].

This is another game that I won by not fully understanding how to pull off combinations with the cards, giving up and pursuing a simplistic single-minded strategy (getting the red cards with the arrows).

There are some similarities between Ora et Labora and Puerto Rico and I'm not a big fan of either game.  I'm clearly in the minority on this one.

Massive goods conversion machines (uh, buildings). Build, build, build. Most buildings were only used when they were built. You need to build because it is an ending condition. otherwise the game will never end. It took us three hours, should come down to two, when the players are familiar with the buildings and their complicated conversion abilities. Interesting game, lots of room to improve my game, not sure if I will be eager to invest the time to really get good at this game. After all it is pretty solitary, not my primary type of game.

This is the ultimate engine-building cube converter and comes with a very intimidating chart of every building that can be built and there are a ton of them. Once you get going though it starts making sense -- I wouldn't call it easy but it's certainly manageable. Just get a good night's sleep before playing.

I really like the worker placement mechanics in this game and especially the resource wheel. Cool game, not sure I'd want to play it all the time though. Also, it's not just multi-player solitaire as you'll definitely want to [i]try[/i] to keep track of what your opponents plans may be. They can place in your buildings and of course build things that you've been saving up for.

I'd like to explore Ora Et Labora more. It's seems among Rosenberg's most sprawling games with a real sense of growth over the course of play. I also greatly enjoy the spacial element. This is clearly the beginning of Rosenberg's less punishing and more open series of games, and I find the flavor of those to be fascinating in their own more contemplative way.

My biggest concern with this game is the static setup, but that may not truly be an issue until after several more plays.

RATING: 7
Feels more open than Le Havre, which always feels like shipping steel is the one optimal strategy. Gone are the feeding requirements - no upkeep in this game. That's an aspect I greatly miss, it exerts pressure. Instead there are settlement phases where you have the opportunity to place special buildings for bonus points. If you miss out on this, you fall behind. There are some complaints of the euro points grab where there are VP everywhere, which is valid. The interaction is minor, but it's there and it can be important as you can force your opponent to use their workers.

All in all, it's an optimization game and a fine one.

After playing Agricola I really appreciate the freedom and lack of punishment in this game. Rather than focusing on collecting food to feed your family you may choose your own path to victory, of which there are many.

Wow, only one play, but wow - both my wife and I really enjoyed this to the point where we discussed the game in great detail the next day and (even better) she may be willing to lift the boardgame purchase embargo.

I like how this game plays and how it looks - great production values. When I saw the resource pieces were double sided I was worried that this would be something like Le Havre, which I find to be fiddly. In practice this was not the case and I could keep track of what was what pretty easily; as could Mrs Fish who has not yet had the pleasure of playing Le Havre.

The dial that determines resource availability is very good and forces some really interesting decisions on the players and the 'need to feed' is not a pronounced as either Le Havre or Agricola both of which are pretty good change-ups.

So, nothing to dislike about this one so far and, did I mention, Mrs Fish likes it so should I purchase it (Cancon, probably) then it will get a fair bit of table time.

This is not as tight as Agricola or Le Havre, so it feels much more relaxed.  There is no stress of having to feed people. What's more, being blocked from an expected action doesn't lead to that crushing feeling of failure that you can get in Agricola or Le Havre; there is always an expansive array of options at your disposal.  Every turn feels overwhelming and fascinating.

However, the game doesn't have a great arc:  even though my tableau grows, I don't actually feel the sense of growth that you get in Le Havre (where you ship for 100+ points in the final rounds).   In the final rounds of Ora et Labora, one action can get you a Wonder or 3 relics (representing a lot of points), but you doesn't *feel* like a dramatic change over what you accomplish in the first rounds.

I enjoy Agricola and Le Havre but burned out on playing them so much, so I am very glad Uwe Rosenberg created a similar type of game to entertain me for hours.

I really like the tweaks to the Le Havre system to streamline game play.  There is still a lot of information on each building card so it will take several plays before I feel comfortable with a strategy.

So far I've been playing the short multi-player version and that continues to take 2-3 hours so we aren't quite ready to tackle the standard game just yet.

2nd Gameplay with 4 players. 5 hours of Game play. Great Game. I want to play again before give my score. 
3rd game. The game is awesome. Best one of 2011 and the best of Uwe. With newbies it will be a nono. If you get to know the game ( and you get it really fast) new players will have a hard time against more experienced players.

I'd play it again, but I think Le Havre is better. It uses the wheel to track goods quantities instead of the sometimes massive piles of chits, which is nice, but also the variation is taken out since all of the buildings show up in the same order each game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
A game of efficiency. Like Le Havre, you are presented with 10+ types of goods to build things, make food and transform them to goods with better value. The turn structure is similar - you take goods or use/build a building. 

One key difference between OeL and Le Havre is the addition of spatial placement in OeL, which adds a little complexity. On the flip side, the placement of settlement is effectly a feeding round as it grants points to players that are prepared. (as opposed to deducting points for not able to prepare enough foods)

Despite the randomized special building in Le Havre, it seems that there's a little more variety in OeL, as there are more routes to victories.

With two games almost identical, Le Havre seems to be more elegant and streamlined than OeL. Still, Both games are fantastic!

The problem is that you quickly lose the complete picture of options.

Its a solid game, I just preferLe Havre to this, and other game types to this.

Fun brewing beer though.

In France/Ireland, players fell trees or cut peat, build buildings, or send their clergymen to work in buildings. The central mechanism is a wheel that turns every round, and players gather their resources depending where the good is located on the wheel. The player mat has some peat and trees that have to be removed before buildings can be placed (much like Farmers of the Moor). 

Everytime the wheel passes a settlement phase, players build a settlement, which score points for adjacent buildings. Otherwise, VPs, are scored for buildings and goods (like Le Havre).

There are a large number of buildings and decisons so it is hard to find the optimal path. I enjoy trying to solve these sorts of problems and look forward to more plays. Rating likely to rise after more plays.

Another great from Uwe Rosenberg. I love the production chains reminiscent of the old 'Settlers' computer games. The spatial element in this one is great and combined with the bigger variety in scoring meant that it worked really well for me, somewhat surprisingly given that I didn't like 'Le Havre'.

I love how much is going on in this game despite the simplicity of the basic mechanics. There's never a time when there's nothing to do, just better and worse or different. That said, there are sooo many cards, and with the wrong crowd I could see this bogging down terribly with AP. The decision space does explode in the second half of the game.

Masterpiece, perfect game.

It is better than Agricola and Le Havre in many ways: less fiddly, a significant spatial element, no random components (a very strong plus for me), deep choices with many paths to victories, etc., etc...

A tough, long game; perhaps the pinnacle of difficulty in the euro genre? Makes Agricola seem like a walk in the park and Le Havre Candyland. Delightful mechanics, both playing and scoring, make for hours well spent. As usual with the Rosenberg big box games, there's a learning curve in buildings/resources.

Too many buildings to remember, too many options to consider. We played a three player game in about three hours, that is not overly long, but I tried not to think much, since I did not know all my options; with experience the game would be longer, not shorter because of AP.
It is a clear descendent of le havre. In comparison I consider the wheel the only improvement; the special buildings instead of feeding and the even greater  multitude of options in my opinion detract from the game's value. There is already more than enough variety of buildings to build or send a worker to in le havre to induce AP, ora et labora more than doubles that.

Swiftly moving engine building, with a huge number of seemingly balanced combo options. Felt quite procedural, though, and did not leave me with a need for replaying.

Has some really weird component choices. Also, serious issues with badly miscut counter sheets, so I would recommend opening the box and checking the contents before leaving the FLGS where you bought the game.

Tackle boxes obligatory.

RATING: 9
If you love Agricola or Le Havre, most likely you'll love Ora et Labora as well. The complexity is a little bit above Le Havre. But there is no dealing with debt or hunger though, makes the game felt "less pressuring". 

If you love Glen More, this game might be suitable for you. Ora et Labora is almost similar to Glen More, complete with whiskey, and even more, with beer and wine! 

And, if you love Homesteaders, then this game might be for you too. Ora et Labora is almost similar to Homesteaders but without the bidding mechanic. Collecting resources from buildings, building building-combo, and building high-VP-building are the main activities in both games. 

I rated it lower than Agricola, because Agricola can be played faster, and the playing strategy is easier to explain to newbies.

Bel gioco (se vi piacciono i tedesconi), per carità, ma se avete già giocato ad Agricola e a Le Havre probabilmente rimarrete delusi perché Ora et Labora regala veramente poco di più: la rondella che ultimamente va di moda. Gli appezzamenti di terreno solo gli stessi di Agricola mentre le risorse che servono per fare carte/edificio e che hanno lato A e lato B sono le stesse di Le Havre. Il tutto viene arricchito da un'ambientazione impalpabile. Malgrado tutto però penso che ci rigiocherò presto perché è un titolo che merita di essere approfondito; combo e pianificazione sono alla base della vittoria.

RATING: 8.5
Fixing the central mechanic from Le Havre, replacing it with a functional rondel and an excellent on/off worker placement system, Ora is definitely a step up on one of its ancestors. It is, however, a lot more thinky than Agricola, and a great deal more tactical than Loyang. It can drag in the hands of slow players.

I'm pretty much won over by it, but perhaps only for now.

A good game, but perhaps overly complicated by the myriad of different available resources. I feel like it could have been narrowed down to fewer of them, as to avoid some of the inevitable analysis paralysis that a game like this causes.

The resource wheel is a very good idea, which makes managing the value of the different resources a breeze. Unfortunately the overall quality of the components is not quite good, and all the expansion boards end up being bent one way or another, since they are so thing.

Given how much of a brain burner it can ben, I'm not sure I would rather play this one, instead of other german titles, but it is a good game nonetheless.

This now supplants Le Havre as my favorite Rosenberg game. It is less game-y than both Agricola and Le Havre, which I don't mind these days.  I really enjoy the different ways that points can be scored, either through buildings or settlements or through various goods paths.  With a few plays under my belt, the player interaction is more apparent and interesting.  I instantly liked this game and have enjoyed every play so far.

A great 'early Uwe' game. Interesting mechanics, indirect meddling with your partner's plans. The only thing I do not like about the 2 player version is the absence of a fixed end. Because of that the game can easily drag for quite some time and overstay its welcome. Other than that, excellent. If you like Agricola + Le Havre, I would recommend at least giving it a shot.

[b]Ora et Labora[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8/10 -> [b]10[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]Ora has become one of my son's favorite Uwe games, so it's managed to hit the table quite a bit in the last year given how long it takes to play. A year ago I said I enjoyed Ora more than Le Havre due to the spatial aspect of placing buildings, which I still think is a great mechanic, but I've since reacquired Le Havre and come to the conclusion that it may be my favorite Uwe game at this moment. I can definitely say, without hesitation, that Ora et Labora and Le Havre offer different play experiences and I'm glad to have both in my collection. If I want to play something punishing and tense I'll play Le Havre and if I want a more laid back experience I'll choose Ora et Labora. 

Like all of Uwe's games, Ora plays great with 2 and while it has an involved set up the game flows smoothly once you're playing. My son and I can usually wrap up a game in 90 minutes. Confrontation is low although you are competing to build the same buildings, but similar to Le Havre you can pay to use someone else's building. Another change from Le Havre is your worker pool has two workers and one abott. The abbott is a great addition because when you build a building you can immediately send him to the building to activate it; this sets up the opportunity to create some very productive turns. 

All in all Ora et Labora is yet another Uwe game I love and would easily recommend to folks that enjoy a meaty resource management/conversion game that offers a unique spatial aspect to the game and some very different ways to score points [i](i.e. settlements vs. wonders)[/i]. With the recent reprint Ora et Labora is now easy to find and definitely worth checking out.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]This was the last of Uwe's heavier games I'd yet to play. After two plays it probably lands in my top three Uwe games (alongside Agricola and At the Gates of Loyang, bumping out Glass Road). Ora shares many similarities to Le Havre (think lots of goods chits that can be flipped over to upgrade them). I enjoy Ora a lot more because of the spacial aspect to the building layout on your board can lead to a lot of end game points if you plan ahead properly. It was also interesting to see how Uwe took the resource wheel of Ora and re-implemented/streamlined it in Glass Road. 

I played with 2 and 3 players and it played equally well at both counts. This will definitely see double digit plays over the next year, I'm glad I finally decided to add this one to our collection. Most months Ora et Labora would have been my game of the month, but GoL was that good.[/i]

Rating 9 after one 2p game.

Excellent game with a ton of options and paths to follow. Those carping on lack of replayability are probably getting ahead of themselves - I don't think there's a single "killer" strategy that will always work, and the timing issues of how to get such a strategy to work given that the buildings you need will likely be spread across several players will probably be enough to neuter it even if it does exist.

The potential for expansion of the system is just as wide as with Agricola or Le Havre, the only difference is that you might have to wait for another card set to come out for a while. But until then, I can easily see investing a few dozen plays into both the French and Irish versions, at which point any reasonable person would have to admit they got their money's worth.

Lovely game, my first "euro" purchase in many, many years. I wanted a game that hit on some of the "best" euro ideas of the past few years and this one showed up on several lists. Good purchase, expensive for what you get IMO. Feels more like a ... $50ish purchase, not a $70. Although, given the fact there are "Ireland" and "France" versions, it's practically like getting two games in one box. I don't regret spending the $70.

This game feels like a lot of other games when I play it. Mostly it feels to me like the Settlers card game, in three dimensions while spun up on speed. You're attaching locations to locations, juggling a dozen different resources, chasing VPs along several tracks (goods, locations and settlements). The economies lock together in baroque ways, and I think the game only gets strategic once all your players know wtf is even in the locations deck.

The complete lack of randomness feels scary but I've never had two games play the same. The rondel mechanic is wonderful -- my first rondel game! Very clever. 

Things I'm not loving so far:

* Really hard to read everyone's locations. This is probably eased a lot when everyone knows the locations. Until then, it's tedious while players go through and systematically review everyone's playmat every turn.

* Huge space suck on the table. This game takes more space than Mage Knight to play!

* Hard to eyeball peoples' current scores. Might be a feature and not a bug. Still deciding.

Anyway, I'm very glad to have gotten my old Euro bug scratched with this game. Got this and Dungeon Lords (and Mage Knight) in about the same time, and while they all have very Euro mechanics, this one feels the most stuffy/NPR. Feel like I should be eating cheese and complaining about America when I play this.

One of those games like Le Havre and Homesteaders where you do better if you study the buildings, know what's coming up and therefore know what resources you need to have to build those buildings exactly when they appear. And then either have a pre-planned strategy, or have studied the game enough to be able to develop and implement a cohesive strategy along the way, on how you're going to convert resources into major points using your buildings' powers. Which all seems like too much work to me to really-really enjoy the game. None-the-less, it's obviously a fine piece of design, providing numerous paths to explore on how to convert resources into VPs. And if that's the type of thing that gets your boat floated, you'll no doubt enjoy this.

awesome awesome awesome.  a heavy euro game.  if you like le havre, you will probably like this too.  it is not the same, but the feeling is similar - engine building / goods conversion / the awesome move you want so badly to make seems like seems so close that you can almost grab it.....almost.  maybe you just need one more round.  just one more.....

Although I am late to the party, I think this has become one of my new favorite games. It scales well with 2-4 players and feels expansive. I know many people on BGG use the term "sandbox game" with derision but I love the expansiveness of this game. Given the almost limitless options available to you, even with the same cards showing up every game, I view the "sandbox" aspect not as a criticism but as a compliment. A game that will definitely be a mainstay on my gaming table for the foreseeable future.

Update 2/16: Just introduced this game to three new players and they loved it. It was a little long (about three hours but one newbie was very AP) but very little downtime.

RATING: 6.5
After one session: undecided. The game has a lot of detail in small printing. You'll need several sessions to get to know the cards. 

The game looses score due to the poor quality: thin boards that bend. Cards that bend and don't lay still on the table due to that. The rickety roundel that you are supposed to flip sides on depending on number of players, but difficult to loosen the plastic knob. 

Played a few more times, but the rating stands sofar.

Ora et Labora is an improved version of Le Havre.  The game removes Le Havre's economic backbone--coins are still present, but the game really revolves around collecting the right resources, of which coins are one of many.  Feeding is replaced by optionally building settlements; these can be paid for with a variety of different resources, and score big at the end of the game.  Resource collection is replaced with a less-fiddly resource wheel, and imbalance of player turns has been eliminated.  Buildings now actually have a physical location, which both restricts their ability to be built as well as affects their end-game scoring.  The result is a deep game that offers a number of paths to victory--something that Le Havre promised but never seemed to quite deliver upon.

I noticed this game was made by the creators of Agricola, and since several friends already owned Agricola, I thought I would get this one instead. Instead of a farm, here you are building a monastery. It has a similar mechanic, with workers taking actions and goods stacking up when they are not taken. However, it feels less intuitive than Agricola, with a lot of small pieces and details on the cards adding to a slightly 'messy' feel. Still a perfectly good game in its own right, but doesn't compare all that favourably to its cousin.

[color=red]Soloable Game[/color]

[color=blue]Playtime: ~90-150 minutes. Depends on the new players as well as player count. Averages about 2 hours.[/color]

Comment: Not sure how I feel about this game. There is a lot I love about it, but some that I feel could be done better. It's a different beast than Agricola and La Havre. There is no pressure for having food/energy although having more of both of those at certain times can give you more points. The biggest complaint I have against this game is that there is zero randomness. You could play 2 exactly the same games if you wanted. This leads me to believe that you may run into group think with this game faster than Agricola or La Havre.

[b]Update[/b]: Alright, when playing with the actual rules, this game is freaking brilliant. We were playing mostly correctly before, but stone came out a full rotation too early and we had screwed up the settlement phase by actually being able to build the building you were handed in that round. Holy hell does that game become much more intense and awesome. I still do feel like it might become slightly scripted, but not having stone early on really changes the whole dynamic of the game.

[b]Update 2:[/b] After finally getting to play this 4 player, I have to say it was great. I still think 3 is the optimal number, but 4 players was much more difficult and the resources were a lot harder to come by. Different buildings, players fighting over things, it was glorious. A bit hard to keep track of everything since the cards are so small, but I liked it a lot. I'm not as fond of the 2 player ending condition as I find it can just drag a bit and you're forced to buy buildings that may be suboptimal just to stop your opponent from doing things. It just feels...lackluster. I enjoy it, but not nearly as much as I do with a higher player count.

[color=green]Optimal Player Count: 3 > 4 >> 2
Works well with all player counts.[/color]

Includes the upgraded player and landscape tiles. They're thick cardboard instead of the thin cardstock they had before.

Hideous rulebook, I can't mobilize myself into reading this again for a refresher of the rules. The urge to play it again is not strong enough.

Traded away at Alphaspel.

Hm, "Ora" gave a pretty good first impression. It was my first game of a Uwe Rosenberg-design as well. But although I had a pleasant time, I still felt slightly underwhelmed.

So, um, exactly how many times do you have to play this game before it starts to feel tense? There are many (too many?) ways to score your precious vp:s. If you can't do this and that just do that and this this round. Rack em up, one way or another - the points will come. 

Of course - one can optimize. Get more points next time, when you are exporing new combos. But when the game generates ridiculous amounts of points for each player at the end, playing good will be more of a "maximizing your points"-thing than "beating your opponents". Many Euros are unfairly accused of being a multiplayer solitarie, but Ora et Labora truly is one.

That beeing said, I actually enjoyed my first game with my wife. The kids saw a film. We where playing and chatting a bit. Drinking some belgian beer. More plays will show exactly what the game brought to that pleasant time.

Oh, one more thing - I really liked the production wheel!

Pretty much exactly the same thing as Le Havre, and I say that without cynicism. Virtually the only difference is a minor mechanical one that he probably thought of while Le Havre was being shipped and said, "Damn, wish I'd put that in there! Well, might as well just make a new game now." There is an element of spacial positioning, but it's just another layer on top of the cake of sameness, and with the same gameplay as Le Havre comes the same shortcomings: too many options for player turns, too much resource recycling, and too much having to stand up and hump the table so you can see exactly what buildings everybody else has so you can decide what you want to do. He may have (slightly) improved resource handling, but dissemination of player information has still completely eluded his grasp.

Rating of 6 might improve, but this game is so convoluted and suffers from some really poor production. Specifically, I found I wanted to use the buildings belonging to other players, but to even be aware of what those are, I had to attempt to read tiny cards across the table. I'm probably being unfair, and I'm pretty confident my rating would improve, but for now I'd much rather have a game of Agricola than this.

Liked the first 90% a lot.  The end of our two-player long games bogged down a bit though. This might be a player problem  rather than a game problem. Not as good as Le Havre for me, but my partner liked it more.

Still, a fantastic game.

Very heavy game. Which I a find a minus point in this game is that you don't have a clear overview of the remaining buildings (cost + function), like you have in Le Havre. That there are buildings and you can use those of your opponents by paying them is the only similarity with Le Havre. This game feels totally different (which is good). I like the mechanism with the 'rondel' to get resources. But this is definitly a game you just wanna play with hardcore gamers as there are probably tons of combo's and layers you can only find out after a couple of plays. Steap learning curve.

A very solid Rosenberg game.

Even though the game is exactly the same during set-up, minor decisions quickly change the resource availability of the game (much like Caylus). 
The added area-management aspect really adds a quirky kind of tension. 

Unfortunately, acquiring relics seems like a "suckers' play", and capitalizing on either all yellow buildings, or mountainside abuse seem to be the clear paths to victory.

Still, though-- a solid resource euro, with the elegant touch of the rondel mechanic.

RATING: 8.5
Extremely solid. I rate it less than Agricola, because I feel the game has been somewhat "solved", having played it as many times as I have.

That isn't to say there isn't a great deal of replay-ability-- because there is. But the game almost always (for me) turns into 1 of 2 or 3 strategies. For all the hype of there being -so many- decisions, they tend to boil down quickly.

Still, though, I'll play this over Le Havre any time; it's an excellent, "non-scarcity" kind of game.

Interesting mix between Agricola and Le Havre, with some new additions. Really like the building placement part of the game, should you clear this forest (which might not be the best action at the time) to make room for a high scoring building in a great spot, or should you place that building somewhere where it will score significantly less (but save the forest clearing action). Comes with a French and an Irish variant with significantly different buildings that should allow for a high degree of replayability.

RATING: 8
Whew! This is a complicated one. So many resources that you can turn into other resources in order to turn them into yet other resources to turn them into points... It gets easier after more plays, when you can mentally put all those resources in their separate categories and have some understanding of what they're for and how many you need. It's also easier if you play it two-player, or the three-player short game, as only the basic building will be used, and those have pretty clear uses. The buildings for more players will do things like change energy into money, and it isn't at all obvious whether money is of more use than energy. And having to remember that you have the option of changing your energy into money is a lot more mentally taxing than remembering that you can change malt into beer or cattle into meat.

There's so much to consider before you can take the simple action of picking up a card and placing it on your mat. Do I have the resources to build it? Can I use it immediately? Do I have the resources to use it? Do I have a use for the resources it gives me? Is is worth enough points? Do I have a free space to build it, and if I have multiple, what's the best one? So maybe you want one of the other 10 or so buildings on offer, where you have to ask yourself the same questions...

The beauty of this game is its plethora of strategies, that seem really well balanced. I played Ora & Labora against myself a few times to get a better understanding of how the game worked. Since they only difference between the players was their strategy, I was also interested to find if any one was dominant. The scores were 201/202/206 in my three-player short game, and 352/353 in my two-player game. That's a small sample size, sure, but to me it shows that you really can take many different paths playing Ora, and a difference in scores will be mainly due to skill, and not because of taking a better path.

That makes Ora a very interesting game. The setup and the buildings used are always the same, but there's a lot to explore. Normally, I'm really not a fan of games with multiple paths to victory and multiple ways to score points, as they often feel like playing a spreadsheet instead of other players, but I'll make an exception for Ora. Timing, availability of resources, competition with your fellow players for buildings... a lot of things make you reconsider what you're doing many times during the course of a game. That makes playing it very engaging, and seeing how it all unfolds a really interesting experience.

Doesn't disappoint. Improves upon Le Havre, wherein the loan-fuelled coal-to-coke-to shipping line strategy is dominant. This is a real sandbox game which, though light on interaction, is incredibly engaging for the number of fantastic options the game presents you with. Like most Uwe games, your actions are your most precious resource, meaning the game can be prone to slight AP. The spatial element is simple but genius, adding another dimension to your engine game. The worker rhythm is another enjoyable mechanic, giving even more importance to proper timing. The game is so deep and complex, I'm convinced only a computer could play it perfectly, and I have no worries about replayability.

While the roundel is a good design feature that reduces the fiddliness of managing piles of resources, this is otherwise too similar to Farmers of the Moor and Le Havre to be justified in my collection.

This is a very good game that is similar to Le Havre in building and use of buildings and similar to Farmers of the Moor Agricola expansion in having to clear moor and forest for resources and creation of development spaces.

There is a short version and long version for the 2, 3 and 4 player games, plus a solo game.  Each can be played with either the French cards or the Irish cards.

For your first game, you need to play the short version.  Although the game mechanics are straight forward, there is a lot of complexity in deciding which buildings to build and what to produce.  Your first short 1 hour game is likely to take 3 hours or more.

An excellent mind taxing game. (Not for people who like simple games.)

I played this once 2 weeks ago.  I remember liking it, even though failing grandly.

+nice theme
+various viable strategies which are fun to create
+nice rondel with available resources

-low replayability
-learning curve is hard and boring (one whole game is a necessary sacrifice)

This game has a lot of planning ahead with a strong, take what you need/want vs take what is very good, element. Placing buildings and terrains is crutial and adds another great aspect to the game. Nice tokens and good theme are a strong part of this game as well.

First game is a nightmare though. Its impossible to plan ahead when you don't know any of like 50 building, 20 resources and witout a clue about placing everything on a table. I strongly suggest a short version for this. Another con is in my opinion replayability below average. There is just a few good strategies on each side (french and irish) and after a few games most of them are exploied, which leaves you with only polishing them, since there is practicaly no way of blocking another player for more than one turn. Buying a crutial building for a strategy is not crutial at all, since you always can buy your way into other player's buildings. 

Overall this is a good game, but it may quickly grow dust on itself after you've played it a lot.

Of Rosenberg's harvest games I like O&L most. It is an excellent Euro and a real brainburner. In my view the pinnacle of resource/good conversion games.

In comparison to Agricola this is less mean/cutthroat since worker placement is watered down: There is not a common pool of actions, which only the first worker can take and there are a lot more options/buildings, and you can pay other players to use their buildings. But you still have this "should I take 4 clay now or could I wait for 1 round more?". Also you have always the same number of workers, which I like a lot (in Agricola the player being able to get more workers early has a big advantage).
 
[-]The way the games play out offer also more variety than Agricola.[/-][i](I have played Agricola a few times since writing this review and enjoyed Agricola much more. This comment is not true anmyore)[/i] I also like the spatial element of the game, which is more of a nice addition than the central element. The artwork is nice and it adds some fun, when you see your cloister growing. Evem though the cardboard of the player boards is thin, it has a good quality and does not affect gameplay negatively. The cards are a bit tiny, but if they were bigger you would not be able to play this game on a normal table; with reference sheets the small cards are no problem.

So my general pattern with Rosenberg's designs is that I don't enjoy them that much on my first play and then like them more on subsequent plays. So this could easily go up from a 6, though I'm not sure why I would choose this ahead of Agricola or Le Havre. Maybe if I play by accident some time?

wow a lot going on in the game for a first time solo play.  As it was my first play it was a bit of a tactical game however, a longer strategy after knowing the cards would probably be the better way to play this game. You need a lot of space and flexibility of space for this game.  Overall, though a great puzzle game that a most pure resource management. this can create AP but that's what type of game this is.  One down side for me it took 3 and a half hour to play solo for my first play thus it will be tough to get this to the table for me.   Merkator somewhat scratches the same itch as this game although I would consider this a heavier game by far.  However, it really reminds me of Roads & Boats  where you are trying to find a strategy to almost solve the resource management problem yet for me fall short as I think roads and boats has more depth and replay ability.  I think eventually some will consider this game solvable and this  might be possible because there is not any thing that is variable with the game start other that the 2 different scenarios.  I expect expansions for this game to keep those hardcore players happy as they did with Le Harve.

I have now played my first game of this (the short three/four player variant). I was impressed by the way the rules were laid out, the intuitive nature of the cards (and the booklet of plain English versions to make sure you knew exactly what each card did). The game seemed less fiddly than Le Havre and yet had a more sophisticated development than Le Havre. Over-all I really enjoyed it. Players take it in turns to take one action, which is mostly a worker placement to activate a building. These generate or convert resources. The basic resources which feed into this are controlled by a rondel, which means that the longer a resources is not gathered the more resources are gained. Then resources are converted to new resources, which can be further converted. Resources can be converted to increase their victory points values or they can then be spent to construct buildings and settlements for more victory points.

RATING: 8
Good game, very "thinky" - and with no random elements nor even any variation in setup (except for choosing to play the Ireland or France variant - I've only played twice, both with France), but surely still more than replayable enough due to the immense variety of options available to each player every turn. Not one of my top games to suggest right now, but I'd rarely turn this down - and, more than most games we own, this one will take many plays to become competent in. But, as I said, it's only been played twice since we got it (Christmas 2012), and as more and more new games come out, this one inevitably keeps slipping down the list of ones I want to play. But an excellent game nonetheless, one which I really should try to play more.

After an initial play of this, I feel there is an absolutely awesome game in there hiding behind a brain blending amount of things to keep track of and do (especially in a 4 player game). It's gaming overload; an AP player's nightmare. To me, this is verging on the type of game I'd prefer to play on a computer as opposed to on a table.

RATING: 7.5
I'm not sure I agree with the current hype machine on this game. It's a tough game, but that doesn't automatically make it good. So far, I enjoy Agricola, Le Havre and possibly even Loyang more.

I only have one game in, but it lacks tension and it produces building overload. So many buildings come out at once it's a bit much. I'm sure it gets better with repeated plays, but I won't have repeated plays when everyone experiences building overload. I may try it with 3 instead of 4 to see how it goes because I think there are less buildings then. The buildings worked with Le Havre because you only had 3 choices at a time. In Ora, there are times where 10 new buildings enter the market on a single turn.

RATING: 6
a bit too computational since the game is entirely deterministic.

I think I mostly object to flipping fiddly tokens over a lot to find the ones you need.  The game should be one I like, but it rubs me the wrong way.

--Feb2012-- Very enthusiastic about receiving my own copy.  I really enjoyed the first time out - despite being somewhat overwhelmed by the options and micro-instructions.  Yet somehow, the game state was pretty sensible at any point.  I'd be delighted to play again, I think.
--Jan2013-- Yet on repeated play the bloom is off for me:  I'm finding that the game (that is, the decisions regarding strategy and tactics) are overwhelmed by the operational mechanics to the degree that I'm not able to "see the matrix" well enough to make good decisions.  I prefer games with less clutter and greater clarity.  Even _Le Havre_ (not a paragon of either!) is better for me.

RATING: 5
Good game, but very limited replayability due to the limited tiles.  Although, people who like games where they know exactly what will come up every time they play  may love it.
This stagnancy also gives players who have played before a much more than ordinary advantage over players who have not played before.  Some variability that all players would have to unexpectedly react to might have helped this game enormously.

A longer game than I care to play, for the most part. But you get a lot for your time, and so that balances it. The theme-as-metaphor is particularly strong: the resource conversions make sense, and maybe even tell a larger theme-as-narrative story. My middle son put Ora into his top ten after just two plays, and said this is the sort of game that you don't care so much winning or losing--you play for the experience of it. I think this is astute, but for this reason and others I think this is not a game for everyone. For me it will likely be a game I enjoy playing...once or twice a year.

An extended design for the Harvest Triology of Uwe Rosenburg, my favorite designer. The mechanics follow the line of the previous three: place worker to occupy buildings, flip-overs of tokens, food and energy etc. The luck factor is the least of the four, as the buildings are displayed one in a time and the settlements pop out in fixed order. Everything is under control except your opponents' strategies. I especially like the setting where six basic goods are almost of the same value.

Another incredible game from Uwe Rosenberg. This could be called a mix of Agricola and Le Havre. After playing once there seems to be a bit too many options on what to do. Currently I prefer Le Havres tightness on producing and spending food. Ora et Labora seems a bit easier on that matter but has a lot more to optimize which might prove cumbersome for whoever who is prone to analysis paralysis.

Very solid, well-designed Euro. It's fun, deep, and tense. Though, two problems stop it reaching the same heights as Le Havre did for me: First, it might possibly have a problem with determinism, especially as a two-player game in the early stages, but I think all games will eventually branch out - which will offset this. Second: it takes hours, longer than Le Havre and Agricola. 

There's enough depth and a solid enough basis to mean even with these problems, I think I'll get my money's worth out of this game - and it's definitely closer to Le Havre than Agricola (which is great for me - as I prefer Le Havre).

I'd say it's a game that should eventually be in every collection, but probably should come after Le Havre.

Although I play mainly heavier euros, Ora et Labora proved too much for me. You absolutely can't play it intuitively, scoring points as you pursue a chosen strategy - you have to constantly calculate the gains from every possible move. I don't like games which make me feel like an accountant, so I'd much rather play Agricola.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Enjoyed my play of this. Probably wouldn't suggets it, but would be happy to play if it was brought to the table. Does possibly seem (as with Mr Feld's games) that there might be so many different ways to score points that everything will work out nearly equally well - until players get experience with the system. A little less fiddly than Agricola, and with the swinginess of the cards removed, is how I feel about it. If we didn't already own Agricola and instead wound up with this, I think we'd be quite happy with it. So for me solid, worthwhile, but ultimately doesn't quite set me on fire.

Thinking about this reminds me that the not-so-much-loved Mercator has the enormous benefit of simplicity/quick game time. 

I am a fan of Uwe, but not really a follower (and STILL not played Le Havre...)

A lot more plays and the decision making process is still as difficult as ever.
I have never played Le Havre, only Agricola, so I can only compare with the latter.
The potential downside of this game is the AP aspect that could drag the game on into tedious exercise for those who like quick play. 
So many choices to make right from the first turn, made much more difficult by the option to use other players' cards. I was getting a bit tired of resource buying games but this has rekindled a desire for all that wood, clay, peat, wheat, etc.
I like the rondel that increases the value of goods and the pre-set settlement phases when you really must build.
Definitely one of those games you will have to play a lot to get to grips with - and it still provides a huge challenge each time

Only negative is the cards are so small. I understand they need to be to fit onto the table!

This seems like a well designed game, it just felt like there were too many resources for me to keep track of what I needed. I suspect that this one could grow on me as I learn the game better, and develop a better sense of what is coming up and what to value when.

This is the zenith of the small economy games that Rosenberg has recently specialized in. I can't imagine this being superseded - it literally contains precisely as many rules, commodities, cards and combos as the cognitive space can handle! Then again - perhaps there are too many commodities. :)

Like all of his games, the economy is very very tight. However, this game excels because it is a bit more difficult to know how to traverse the market - conversions are not as clean as they have been in the past and many times require planning five or six or ten turns in advance. The worst feeling in this game is when you blow a ton of resources on a settlement or a VP cash out, only to realize that you now need to start over. While Agricola is just brutal - O&L is more of an exhilarating race. And while Le Havre is a swift race through a streamlined trade route - this game is a more adventurous one with many sharp turns and diversions.

This is a true masterpiece in its class - I can say confidently after six plays.

I can appreciate what this game is trying to do, and I would definitely play it again, but I don't need to own it.  I have Le Havre and Agricola and that is probably enough Uwe for me.  I love the wheel mechanic.  Much cleaner than in Le Havre.  My gut is that gameplay can probably get a bit samey.  Just like Le Havre, too many players leads to WAY too many choices of buildings to use.

Based on 1.33 plays (in the first one it was 2ppl and the owner had to leave). Like Agricola but way better - more interactive, many more tradeoffs and options, no stupid card randomness - oh look, I have just the right occupations/improvements so I have a 7-tile stone house! Worker purchase mechanic is just very nice (you don't get locked out of things but you pay and don't cycle your workers as fast), there are lots and lots of tactical decisions and lots and lots of long-term thinking required, or your stuff won't work as well; prone to analysis paralysis. My only full game was super competitive and interesting. Need a couple more plays to see if it will be my new favorite game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
Much closer to Le Harve than Agricola.  More deterministic than Le Harve since the buildings always come out in blocks and any building in that block can then be built vs the special buildings + semi random ordering of the buildings in Le Harve.  

Over all I enjoy playing Le Harve is a little more, but Ora et Labora does have a lot of differences from Le Harve and so playing it rather than Le Harve is certainly enjoyable.  Excepting the lack of randomization during the setup phase of the game, overall the economy works better than Le Harve and is more balanced with more paths to victory.

Hopefully an expansion adds some way to randomize buildings or some other feature which makes each game a bit different to add make it more re-playable over time.

The game itself is very good, but lack of any randomization and the subpar component quality knock my rating of it down a bit.

Played once with 3P. Ora et Labora is a title which can be justifiably compared to [thing=35677][/thing], both being long, low-luck (or in OeL's case, luck-free) resource conversion games. And I'll reiterate it here; these kind of games, while solidly designed, are not quite to my taste. However, OeL has plenty of unique features of its own, compelling or otherwise.

[b]YAY![/b] Ora et Labora can be played relatively quick, clocking in at 2hrs for a 3P game. Due to the swapping out of the frequent, compulsory feeding phases in Le Havre for the less frequent settlement building phase, OeL [i]feels[/i] a bit more forgiving. Despite the resource dial not being central to how the game plays (unlike in [thing=143693][/thing]), it's a pretty clean mechanism.

[b]HMMM...[/b] The spatial aspect in constructing buildings is an interesting distraction, but it also makes scanning opponents' randomly scattered buildings a rather tedious task. Players familiar with the game shouldn't find this a big issue though.

[b]BOO![/b] The variety of resources borders on being overwhelming, and the resource network doesn't feel as tight as Le Havre's.

For now, I am more enthusiastic playing OeL largely due to its more manageable playing time. It's also interesting to see the evolution of concepts in Uwe Rosenberg's games, especially in how Glass Road would end up borrowing the topographic elements in OeL.

[1 play] Better than Le Havre, but both are inferior to the rich theme and smooth play of Agricola. Ora took a very long time to play, but I did enjoy myself. The journey of figuring out the system and exploring the vast universe of possibilities was quite interesting. I like the artwork and found it far more thematic than Le Havre.

I am interested to try this again, but I fear the length of the game would be even more daunting with 4 players (especially if any were new to the game.)

Sadly, it seems to rather combine the bad aspects of Le Havre and Agricola (i.e., the fiddliness and huge amount of different resources of Le Havre and the weird action blocking mechanism and city building from Agricola) rather than the good ones. I might be willing to give it another try, but I'm far from being convinced of that game.

My favorite, so far, of Uwe's worker placement games - It has a good amount of replayability (though not as much as Agricola), can get tight (though not so much as farmers of the moor) and it lets you explore strategies, just not as much as caverna. Somehow, though, it strikes a perfect balance for me. Throw in the resource wheel, I love it.

I'm probably being harsh on this, but even after five plays I have not yet sorted out what, strategically, I am supposed to be doing.  I think it's a combination of the cards being too small to see easily what is going on, and the paths to improve goods being quite complex in many cases.  I will try it again, and suspect its rating will increase as I get more familiar with it.  So far, though, it is a disappointment after the elegance of Agricola and Le Havre.

Sin azar, con fichas de recursos, tableros-paisajes, peones, cartas de edificios, rondel etc. 
Demasiados recursos, creo recordar 14 con anverso/reverso desigual, demasiados tipos de edificios, demasiadas formas de puntuar; en suma resulta abrumador.
Puedes jugar en los tableros ajenos activando un peón ajeno en edificio ajeno, con lo cual estás obligado a estar pendiente también de los tableros de los otros jugadores; ellos pueden hacer lo mismo contigo y debes levantarte a menudo para "fisgar" los tableros ajenos. 
Muy proclive al parálisis, recomendable jugar con cronómetro o en caso contrario tomarse un Valium.
Puede ser idóneo para personas con un CI de 130 o superior, o para los de un CI 100 con más paciencia que un Santo.
Objetivamente no es mal juego, pero no es para mi.

No chance, tabbed resource-landscapes boards, pawns, building cards, rondel, etc.
Too many resources, I remember 14 front / back uneven, too many types of buildings, too many ways to score. Is overwhelming.
You can play on the boards outside activating a foreign laborer in building outside, which you are required to also be mindful of the boards of the other players. They can do the same to you and you often wake up to "snoop" the outside boards.
Very prone to paralysis, recommended to play which chronometer or else take a Valium.
It can be suitable for people with an IQ of 130 or higher, or for an IQ 100 with more patience than a Saint.
Is not objectively bad game, but it's not for me.

Majdnem játék nélkül vágtam bele a megvételébe, de jól döntöttem, hogy előtte csak leültem vele játszani. Sok mindent tudtam róla, hogy Le Havre, Agricola keverék ugyanazzal a szerzővel és hogy nagyon sokan dicsérik. Nos a játék tényleg nagy koppintása főleg a Le Havre-nak, de teljesen más a fő pontszerző mechanizmusa. Ugyanis itt nemcsak a minél jobb épületek beszerzése az egyik fontos feladat, hanem ezek minél jobb lehelyezése a táblánkra. Ezt még megspékeli, hogy vannak olyan falukártyák, amik adott időpontban építhetők csak és ezek csak az eddigi épületeinkből tudnak újabb pontokat kihozni a melléépítésükkel, semmi másra nem jók. A termékszerzési mechanizmus annyiban módosult, hogy egy körön vándorolnak a megszerezhető nyersanyagok, amelyekből megszerezhető mindig nő, ahogy a következő kör kezdődik, majd nullázódik, ha valaki azt termeli. Ez nagyon tetszett, ötletes, jól működő mechanizmus. Ötletes a fa és vályog megszerzésének különlegessége. Ezeket adott lapkánk eldobásával lehet szerezni. De a fő pontszerző rész nem jött be. A Le Havre-ban pont az tetszett, hogy a sok nyersanyagból, hogyan tudom a legjobb átdolgozással a legtöbb kész terméket előállítani, majd ezekből eladni és újabb épületeket venni. Itt is megvan ez a mechanizmus, de nagyon megbolondítja, pontosabban felülírja ezt az építkezés pontossága. Sokkal inkább azon van a hangsúly, hogy hogy tudja valaki a legjobb módon lehelyezni az épületeit, semmit az gazdálkodáson. Nem rossz játék az Ora, de egyrészt erős nyúlás az elődből és véleményem szerint nem is olyan jó, emiatt az épületlehelyezési fontosság miatt. Viszont rövidebb az elődnél. Én ettől függetlenül maradok a Le Havre mellett.

[2012-09-27]
Mint nemrég kiderült számomra a fa és vályog megszerzés mechanizmusa már 2009-ben az Agricola kiegészítőjében szerepelt Uwe mestertől, szóval ez sem újdonság a játékban.

[2012-10-22]
Második játékra is pontosan ugyanaz a véleményem mint elsőre, annyit hozzátéve, hogy nem is rövidebb a Le Havre-nál a teljes Ora, szóval még ez sem húz felé.

Very clever design.  Lots of fun engines to create.  Sadly this game also suffers from stupid amounts of downtime, an extreme game length and the classic problem that I have with many games: If I spend 5 more minutes looking at your boards to see what you can do then I will be closer to winning.  Those 5 minutes compound, yet why play this game for 3+ hours unless you are playing to win.  You could play Die Macher with less effort in a similar play time.

Still, when things start rolling it is fun.  Far better than the grind and repetition of Loyang, and IMO comes out vastly superior to Le Harvre as it doesn't waste energy on having you trying to feed people.  Still, it is no 'Gric.

After just finishing my 4th play of this game, I find it is coming together for me now.

Like other Rosenberg games you are using actions to take basic resources, using actions to convert basic resources into advanced resources and then using actions to convert advance resources into points. I like the resource wheel and the feeling of growth in this, but it's a table hog and it can be a little overwhelming to decide what to do on your turn when there are literally several dozen options on your turns. I like it better than At the Gates of Loyang but nowhere near as much as Le Havre. Although this is quiet different feeling from Le Havre.

After the first play, it's much like Le Havre, with some sweet resource management and building, but with some nice twists in placing cards on a board and having some positional scoring which is also important.

However, I would like to have a complete play under my belt before moving it to a 9.

1 play, 4er

Wow, great game! Feels a lot like Le Havre, which I love, but with enough differences to still be worthwhile owning both. Some differences:
- The wheel is a clever way to replace the goods system of Le Havre (although here, every good becomes more plentiful with every turn of the wheel instead of just specific goods); less fiddly, less cumbersome
- Only the start player has 2 turns per round.
- Everyone has 3 workers, 1 of which is special and may be placed on a building immediately when you build it.
- Players mostly use their own buildings
- There's a positional/spatial element, with each player expanding their own territory, creating space to build, and with building position having potentially huge effects on the player's VPs.
- Buildings come out in 4 steps, but a large number become available all at once in each step ... makes it REALLY tough to learn the game!
- No food requirement each turn; sort of -- in order to build the high-VP building (settlement) when the chance (only 5 times in game) comes around, you need to have collected enough food in the previous turns

Acquire colored cubes.  Trade them in for different colored cubes.  Make sure you know what cards are coming up that help turn those colors into more valuable colors.  Oh yeah, the cards are difficult to read too.  Make sure the whole experience takes a couple hours so it seems "meaty."  UGH!!!

This game has a lot of good going for it.  I love the resource wheel, it is an innovative, fun, and easy way to handle resource collection and game management.  Absolutely brilliant!  I'm a big fan of worker placement games in general and I love some of the unique ideas in this game, such as the work contract mechanic.  I also, as weird as this sounds, just really like games where the strategy is based on turning stuff into other stuff (my friend calls it Transformer Syndrome).  Not sure why, I know it's weird, but I enjoy it and Ora et Labora is the holy grail for that mechanic.

It also helps that there appears to be multiple paths to  victory you can strive for in this game.  In my first play I only won by 12 points and my strategy was focused on buying the most valuable buildings in the game, many of which I never intended to use while the second place player focused mainly on collecting valuable resources with victory point values.  Two completely different paths to victory and a very small score margin, give or take a turn and I could have lost by a handful of points.

This also creates a game that comes with a lot of replay value out-of-box.  Not on the level of my favorite game, Agricola, but with so many paths to victory you can play a different way every time.  There's a decent variety of buildings that scales from 2-4 players and two completely different settings (France and Ireland) with different buildings and resources.

With all that I know I should love this game but it has some annoying parts that hindered my enjoyment of the game.

First, the masses are right, the quality of the components sucks.  Anybody who says different is fighting an uphill battle to defend this game which as I've said above has a lot of good going for it but the components suck.  Flimsy paper instead of cardboard for the plots is awful.  They curl in the humidity and are too flimsy to handle conveniently.  They slide around the table when building your monastic society and simply look trashy for a game with this kind of pedigree.  The cards are of equally low quality, the pegs for the wheels are not properly sized, and the chits are not properly punched.  I've had worse quality components in other great games and I don't hold it too much against the game but it is a huge disappointment, especially the paper used for the plots.  The other, even worse, gripe I have about this game is the huge amount of cleanup time.  Not only are there millions of chits to pick up and separate into containers (some sort of Plano or otherwise storage solution is REQUIRED  -- it's a grave oversight that the game does not come with some sort of solution of its own -- unless you like rifling through a ton of tiny square double-sided chits every game), but sorting all the cards (which are also double-sided for the two game settings) and plots (which need to be sorted by value) takes a long time and if you don't do it properly you just move the time taken to the next game's setup time.  But I mostly ignore this downside because for the game to exist in its form this is a necessary evil.

It also doesn't help this game's chances that I have other great, and a LOT less fiddly, games that fill the same kind of role.

It seems, at first sight/play that Uwe nailed it again. He made a very clever game although very similar to Le Havre. It has the same feeling with a few minor changes. Well, not so minor if we consider that food doesn't have to be payed every turn nor the buildings seem so needed than in the previous. Actually, I don't think I like the fact that players don't use the buildings that much. After my first play I also got the impression that buildings (the construction, not the usage) give too many points. It seems that it doesn't matter that much what buildings are you constructing as long as you do construct them during all game.
I need more plays to rate it properly but the first feeling was ok.

Having forsworn to not buy another Rosenberg game blind after Loyang and Merkator this one sounds much more akin to the holy two, 'Gric and Le Havre. Number one on wish list. Looks like its going to be a £55 RRPs game in the Uk unfortunately

Rules closer to Le havre than 'gric. Looks right up my alley

------------------------------------------------------

Now arrived and its looking good, apart from the player aids which might as well have been printed on toilet paper, instant lamination.

I have only dabbled in a solitaire 2 player run out. With the removal of feeding and addition of a VP generating phase, the spatial planning and the cool WP/Contract mechanic this could be Le Havre + - however, that is my worry. I already have found myself thinking 'Why do i need to learn a whole new set of good conversions whilst i am still happy to play Le Havre?'. The answer maybe that this is better, I suspect the first few games are going to require breaking down Le Havre hard wiring and relearning.

-----------------------------------------------------

After a three player game I can dispel Le Havre worries - this is fantastic, a synthesised and smoothed Le Havre with a splash of Farmers of the Moor. Maybe for its age its not a great, epoch making,  game, in the same way 'Gric/Le Havre dominated and defined 2007 and 2008 for me.

The possibilities in terms of balancing good, buildings and settlements seem  like they might take dozens  of plays to explore. Ownership of buildings seems less important than Le havre, and there are no 'commanding heights' the buildings feel painfully balanced with no no-brainers as to choice. The same with the goods, the importance of the basic goods through out the game feels like a real improvement on Le Havre. My one play did not explore the possibilities of blocking and Prior abuse which i hope is there. One thing I like about Le havre is the competition for the key buildings - the compensation in Ora is the variety in paths to points. 2011 has been a bloody good year for games.

--------------------------------------

Funny after 2 plays I still think this is a great game. however one that, in 2011, feels a little like a side track - its goods conversion par excellence however its does not feel as good now as Le Havre did in 2008, despite it possibly being a better game. If there were only room for this or Le Havre in my collection it would be Le Havre - I like the semi random set up and the battles for the strategic buildings that ensue. Moreover the fact there is, almost, an uninterrupted line to the final conversions means that duffers like me don't have a hope as the brightest will almost always win :)

--------------------

Very odd - lots of opportunities to play but very little desire to compared to Le Havre. 

4th game, unfortunately, confirmed my indifference. 2p it feels far less interactive than Agricola or Le Havre, very little competition for key resources or actions. The myriad paths to victory don't engage me.  This is a game I admire much more than I enjoy. 

Its weird but I prefer piles of resources - maybe just the way I think but a big pile is more attractive to take than a number on a dial

Goods conversions into goods conversions into goods conversions into goods. You would think it would be fiddly, but it isn't. The resource wheel is brilliant and streamlines what could otherwise be a chore. *coughcoughAgricolacough*

Seems more streamlined than Le Havre; still loses points with me because there are so many different cards to remember and see from the other side of the table. Almost certainly the best stuff-to-stuff-to-points conversion game I've played.

Rating went down once I decided I don't really enjoy stuff-to-stuff conversion games.

My interest in further plays has since been even further diminished by the existence of Keyflower, which feels somewhat similar but has a more interesting method of acquiring and activating buildings.

Some theme play.  Fairly easy to learn and play.  Will take a play or two to touch on strategies.  Plays very similar to Agricola, but with a couple of different mechanics.  Game can drag with AP players.  Game components are good - colorful cardstock playing mats, thick chits, wood playing pieces, somewhat durable cards with fair artwork.  Rulebook in color and seemed easy to follow.  Game time about 3 hours which is long for what this game has to offer.

Very similar to Uwe's previous game Le Havre. 
Improvements to that title: the player boards and the spatial impact of your buildings. 
Worse than Le Havre: Even more cards at your opponent's and now they are even smaller and even less readable!
It is probably a good idea to play this a couple of times solitaire to get to know the different buildings before trying the next multi-player approach.

My favourite Uwe game, but that is a lot like my favourite car accident.

With 2 players, we learnt (I was taught) and played the game in about 90 minutes and we finished just before I started to get bored of it. I don't know that I'd want to play it with 3 or 4. 

The cards are relatively well laid out though the VPs should ideally be somewhere else away from the cost for ease of end game scoring.

Also, I'm consistently annoyed when I'm sitting across from someone and I need to be aware of what their tiny, teeny, little, minuscule cards do. This game makes me have to lean over and read them (much like Arkham Horror style cards). I dislike that.

Uwe finally gets it right. OeL doesn't dump random cards on you to seal your fate like Agricola, nor is it impossible to have a fair (same number of turns) game like Le Havre. It does seem overly complex with way too many different commodities--and the summary sheets are daft, having half the information for each version on each side (face plant)--but it's pretty clear and playable. By far my favorite of the three.

I'm still not sure all this complexity makes for a better game, and not just a very hard to learn game.

If you like Le Havre, you'll probably love this. I think I enjoyed it better than Le Havre. It is a worker placement game and an engine game (ie build a building to build goods then build another building that turns those goods into better goods for scoring or whatever) and yet it is a good blending of the two with an interesting mechanism (the rondel) for "adding goods" to the game.

I'm a big fan of Le Havre and Agricola, so I was pretty pumped up to try this. Sadly, it's a step backward. It's certainly challenging, but felt more like work than fun. It also takes my least favorite part of Le Havre - using buildings that other people have constructed - and makes it even more fiddly by putting them on a personal player board. Now all the "What have you built? What does it do?" questions can't even be solved by facing the cards toward other players. Really annoying. I need to play this more to see if it grows on me, but my first play left me a bit flat.

The game achieves a nice stretch between a game where you build something up and always get more/have more options and a game where nevertheless you feel like you never nearly get to do enough.

3 hours for a 2-player game? Yeah,right! Maybe with 2 players that know the game by heart. All these resources/wares,all these buildings that do something different with them - this game is totally overwhelming. Especially during the first session. This is the brainburner that all others take classes at. It makes my head hurt, but it makes it hurt in a good way. 

On a side note: I think it plays quite different from Le Havre. While it shares some elements or shows the same traits concering engine-building, there's some nice touches added. Like making space for new buildings (or settlements) by cutting wood, getting turf or "exploring new areas, increased interactivity due to the commissioned works and the settlements which have a unique kind of scoring. I really wouldn't know how one could see this as less interactive than Le Havre or Agricola. 
All that makes it different enough to justify a place in my collection (of course it's fun enough for that too)

Talk about an intimidating set of rules!!! We played the Ireland set for our first game, as we much more enjoy beer and whiskey than we do wine.  
Once the mechanics were nailed down, the game really fell into place, especially if you've played other games like Agricola before.  
We played as a two player and it was a fairly long game, I can only imagine how much more difficult this game will become with additional players taking resources.  We still need to do a little more digging into the rules and make sure everything was 100% but overall, I really enjoyed the mechanics and available options in this game.  It's definitely NOT a light game at all.  
A huge amount of strategy goes (or should go) into every decision.

After one play I am even more impressed with this game than I was following the reviews. It is very well put together, the integration of the rondel for turns and resources is ingenious and the buildings have quite a bit of variety. I am not sure about replayability as there are a limited number of unique buildings, but time will tell. This is definately one of the best games I've played. Unfortunately, teaching it to others will be quite difficult.

Quite a good game, but I don't know how often I would play it over other Uwe games.  I'd primarily play it 2P since it is quite solitaire, long and requires you to be able to track everyone's buildings for optimal play.  Because of all these things it doesn't seem to be great with more players and with 2 players I might be better of playing Fields of Arle for a similar game.

Pros: Good pacing, great personal space management, working theme, tough decisions. It's like a more manageble and fun le havre with a better theme.

It's one of mr.Rosenberg's games that I really enjoy.

I like Agricola and really like Le Havre, so it is no surprise that I have also enjoyed my first few plays of Rosenberg's latest offering in this vein. I don't have enough plays yet to fully evaluate this very complex system, but I have some early thoughts. The open system that allows you to play with various production paths to score points is much more comparable to Le Havre than to Agricola, which requires you to do very specific things (and a bit of everything).  And there does not appear to be something approaching the importance of Le Havre's coal/coke/iron/steel production chain (although something may emerge for us with more experience). 

Other thoughts: I like the variable feeding associated with village building more than the forced, set feeding amounts of the other games -- more player flexibility to play around with the system. I haven't tried France yet but am intrigued by two different sets of buildings and resources to experiment with. 

It is still too early to say, but I very well might end up liking this even more than Rosenberg's other gems. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Better than Le Havre and not quite as good as Agricola to me. Excellent game loads of fun. Highly recommended. 

Uwe again deserves props for focusing on how to scale the game to different number of players as this one does so perfectly. 

UPDATE: After several years of playing this game off and on I have decided to lower this a point to a 9 instead of a 10 based really on my comment above. It' not quite as good as Agricola. 'Gric is still a solid 10 for me and I do believe it always will be and this game is a lot of fun, I don't mean to say it's not, and it is it's own distinctive game. So while it is gold there is just a tiny bit of tarnish on it and so the rating I gave it I feel should reflect that, and now at 9...does. 

[ImageID=554376]
UPDATE. According to my rules of this thumb image yes the game works with 2 players and if playing the short game does so quite well, but I'd suggest not playing the long game, but NOT because it's long. Rather because it's too many cards and too may resources. The tightness of the game is gone.

I had the same feeling playing this as I did while playing Le Havre. The table is way too busy, it takes much too long to play, choices and AP increase as the game progresses,which increases the agony for those whose decisions were suboptimal as there is no catch-up mechanism. The process of building your kingdom is fun, but this is way too much of a good thing.

There are many common things with Le Havre, but worth to have both games. Personally I prefer Ora et Labora. It is a faster game, it is simpler to play, it does not have the hidden trap of feeding your people that dominates any strategy that you choose and eventually makes the game a race to build the big ships at the end. Ora et labora is like Le Havre, but it is a straight forward race to build the right buildings at the right places and generate the most points. It is a more open game with respect to what is possible to do and achieve more points than the opponents. Le Havre for players that know how to play the game is more a scripted exercise on getting/using the right buildings that will allow you to feed your people and build the big ships at the end. You cannot deviate from this path if you want to win. Ora et Labora does not have a path. It is more open and many different strategies can be pursued. You need to focus on some objective eventually, but you choose what objective and when you commit yourself in it!

In the same vein as Agricola and Le Havre.  If you love those games, which I do, this is more of the same, with just enough different to be new and interesting. I finally decided the only way I'm going to get to play is to bring my own copy.

There is a communal pool of buildings you can build.  Buildings can give you points in one of two ways, either outright, or by being next to a settlement.  Sometimes a building is better at one or the other, or even takes away points.  Buildings allow you to do special things, but your neighbors can also hire you to activate a building for them.  You have three workers, one of which can trigger a building you just built, but if he's not available, no such luck.  Resources keep accumulating every round until someone takes them.  Five times during the game you'll build a settlement, which is the main use of food and energy, which give bonus points themselves and additionally can give even more points if you put them next to some great buildings.  There are a lot of buildings that improve your resources into better food, energy, points, or just give you special goods.  

It helps in this game to figure out a chain of actions that will get you from what you have to some way to get a lot of points.  There are a ton of buildings so this may take you a while to get down.  Building placement is important and can get you a lot of points (my particular weakness with this game).  

The game has a tone of resources and buildings, so it's pretty fiddly and complicated, but it's an incredible game nonetheless.

A better Le Havre. What makes Ora et Labora better? The spatial composition required in the game. I like it, oh so much.

The resource turning (A to B to C) isn't really my cup of tea. I don't hate it, but it feels fiddly.

An efficiency game without randomness. You need to know the buildings and settlements very well to score high. I suspect that once that's happened there isn't much replayability.

not like Agricola or Le Havre, but like them;  you build whole communities in this one; you can expand your personal board; you can use other players workers to do your work for a cost; food is not as hard to come by;  there are a lot of pieces to this game; there are a lot of cards that need reading; getting an efficient engine going to score the most points at the end of the game is what this is all about - food less so (though it still exists);  somehow this was more pleasant than the other two games in its flow

A solid, very well designed heavy euro. Analysis paralysis is a real problem as you can use any building on the board, including your opponents - expect lots of people craning their necks across the table to look at your tableau. For this reason it seems best with two players. 

2015-08-25

Not played since 2013, it's impossible to get this to a table, since it's too long to be played at a general meetup, but not long enough to make a date for it (ie Virgin Queen, Eclipse, etc) ... maybe the the Tuesday meetup might be interested in it... if not then it's time to trade. For 2p games I prefer more direct interaction.

This is closer to Le Havre than Agricola but let down by a few design issues - mostly that the conversion chains are needlessly more obtuse and there's no variance at all.

The spatial building aspect could be interesting if it wasn't so shallow, and the 2 player end game rule is a mess.

RATING: 7
The thing I like most about this game is the neat resource rondel mechanic - it's well implemented and pretty fun.

I really don't like that you have to keep track of everything everyone is doing to play well - since you can use other player's buildings it becomes really difficult to track your options.  Furthmore, even when you have a ton of options, often times none of those options are actually that exciting, which makes the game a bit less fun as well.

Overall I feel it has a cool resource mechanic combined with a bunch of mediocrity and it runs way too long.

An interesting Uwe Rosenberg game.  Less stressful than Agricola, but almost more mathy.  I enjoy the interaction between opponents, lots of using each others buildings while benefiting them.  I also really enjoy the spacial element of orienting things on your board.  

Only thing holding it back is it's a bit too much for me.  It's walking the line of complexity where it feels a bit too stressful, more mental math than I find enjoyable where I'd rather have a game with breathing room for trash talking and open discussion.  Obviously this is a personal preference, it's a very solid game.

Oh, also docked point for the fiddliness of a million and one chits.

Rosenberg is hit or miss for me. After one play, this seems like a hit.  This is the Euro built out to its theoretical maximum.  There are several currencies, each of which is turned into different currencies, which are worth victory points, but can be used in other ways to earn more victory points.  Throw in a dash of building a tableau and a twist on worker placement, and this hits all the important tickboxes of Euro.  It hangs together pretty solidly.  The buildings seem appropriate, the commodities seem natural despite the huge number, and there's enough interesting thematic twists to keep it from feeling like a generic cube-pusher.

I'm a big Le Havre fan, and this game felt very similar to me. Probably too similar in fact, I don't feel the need to buy this since I already own LH. Essentially, it's Le Havre with a spatial element, as buildings have to be built in certain spots in your personal area, and you have to buy more land to expand. The resource dial is a an excellent innovation, much less fiddly.

This game eliminates the need to feed your people/workers which is refreshing. Still a WP game but the turns are expanded in some instances so you can do more things in a two player game. You can also build your own engine and expand your board (with restrictions on the pieces, which makes it an interesting puzzle). Overall, a game that builds on Le Havre in terms of complexity and sophistication...remains to be seen in terms of fun.

RATING: 5
Played twice. In theory, Ora et Labora might be the most compelling of Rosenberg's games to date: the spatial element is more involved, the worker placement has an interesting added layer, and the resource wheel cleverly reduces the moving of chits around. In practice, however, I have found Ora way more difficult to get into than any of his previous efforts. 

Like Le Havre, the rules are relatively simple- the complexity of the game arises from the several dozen unique buildings and their functions. The difference is that in Le Havre the buildings are extremely intuitive, e.g. at the bakehouse you turn grain into bread, at the shipping line you ship goods, etc. In Ora, the buildings seldom make any thematic sense. A typical building in Ora lets you turn 1 sheep and 1 barley into 2 books and a statue. WTF? What's worse is that the production chains in Ora are so much more convoluted than in Le Havre (or Agricola, for that matter). 

When explaining Le Havre, I can point to a few of the pivotal buildings: wharf, brickworks, shipping line, in order to give an idea of the game's narrative arc. In Ora there is no overarching narrative (that I can tell) but rather a myriad of smaller production chains that culminate in piecemeal VP awards. The result is that playing Ora as a beginner feels largely aimless; knowing what to do presupposes an in depth understanding of all the different buildings, many of which won't even appear until the later stages of the game. 

I'm all for opaque games, but Ora isn't opaque so much as  just dense. The "depth" of Ora is more akin to the depth of ASL than to that of GO. For lovers of CCGs and other exercises in combinatorial masturbation, Ora will likely hit a sweet spot. I can tolerate this aspect in games, but it isn't the reason I play them. I've had a blast with Agricola and Le Havre, but I'm not sure whether I have it in me to get past the learning curve of Ora in order to reach the part I enjoy where the focus is on interactive game play rather than parsing the system. Maybe I'm just irrevocably burned out on this type of game.

Fun but hard to get to the table. Lots of ways to victory and I enjoyed playing the game though. Very creative and I like the resource conversion. It did not feel stressful, just fun albeit long. I also got a huge kick out of it since I am a seminarian and played it with two other seminarian friends studying for the Catholic priesthood. However, I think I'm going to trade it since it lacks any real tension and is too long.

I think I am comfortable with saying this is probably Uwe's best effort so far. It does a nice job of balancing predictability with lots of options to keep each playthrough feeling fresh. It's the usual soup of course, gathering resources with workers, then converting them into better resources and eventually cashing them out as points. While no new ground is really turned here, what has been added is spatial planning. Unlike previous Uwe games, where you build each new building in relation to your other buildings matters. Uwe first started toying with this in the Farmers of the Moor expansion for Agricola and it really blossoms here.It's a small thing, but it adds so much to the game.

There are also two different scenarios in the box, one focusing on French monasteries and one focusing on the Irish. It's a fun little touch, with the two having slightly different tech trees and resources. It also screams for expansion, so hopefully, they get a little expansion happy like they did with Agricola.

Revisiting this after a few years away. The spatial aspect could be more interesting: add a little pickup/deliver aspect, or something beyond this minimalist jigsaw, but it can create tricky priorities to juggle.

The lack of a clear strategic line makes it more than just Le Havre 2.0; the original seems better on most counts, but I'm burned on coal/coke/shipping. Really wish there was a fixed endgame for 2p, as the need to count out the scores and the inputs/outputs is tedious. Just a really strange and unnecessary choice.

Clearly this relies on the butterfly effect for variation, and it mostly succeeds (Uwe's puzzles are fascinating), but another card set would be very welcome. Or one where you flip half of them over at random, etc. So I made one: [filepage=148632][/filepage].

[i]I'm bumping the rating from 7 to 8 (details below).[/i]

It's a good, well-designed game - no doubt about that. I love many aspects of it, but...

I appreciate what Uwe tried to do here (it's a very clever resource conversion/spatial puzzle), but it is just too long and overwhelming. You have to memorize the whole production chain and know the future decks inside out to play efficiently and have a long-term plan of any sort. Also, at some point the game gets out of control, there's too many action spaces and possibilities -  planning your strategy around that is extremely hard. 

Still, I see a lot of potential in this game. Maybe it gets less overwhelming after repeated plays. I definitely need to play it again (maybe I'll even grab myself a copy and do some extensive testing).

/update: Bought my own copy. I kept thinking about this game and this is very unusual for me. There's definitely something about it that makes me want to play it more. 

//another update: I played it again, this time with 4 players. It's even more overwhelming that way, but... something just clicked. I don't know why, but I started to really enjoy the thought process behind every decision made in this game. I'm really glad I gave it another shot, there's a whole plethora of strategies only waiting to be discovered. Usually I don't like sandbox games, but Ora et Labora has that special something. It's my second favourite Uwe Rosenberg's design right now (after Agricola).

Le Harve with gold knobs on. Needs quite a bit of table room. So many ways to use collect and the use resources and then more ways to convert to points. Replayability is excellent as can play France or Ireland.  Maybe quite a lot downtime with more players. That said, if you have the time to play then do. Possibly one of my faves.

This has grown on me with each play as I've figured out how the economic engine works. Works well with 2, 3 and 4; the rondel system is brilliant, and the variety of ways to victory means it has quite a big exploration space. It may play out at some point but for now it's in that space of feeling known (so not daunting) but still full of interesting interactions I haven't yet explored.
03/10/'17: A note about the solo game: it is too big and also deterministic - all buildings are used and the goal is to get to 500 points, which is just too much. It took me about 3 hours and because there is no luck there is an optimal approach out there which will take many games to figure out. With the games being so long it just felt a lot like busywork. I like the multiplayer as your choices are far more limited and other player actions affect what you are able to do on your turn (and vice versa), but the solo game is not for me.

Agricola's designer improves on his landmark game.  This game is more fun than Agricola because it's less frustrating.  In Agricola, your plans are easily thwarted by other players taking the available actions, and there usually aren't a lot of good alternatives.  Other players still block actions by taking them in Ora Et Labora, but in O&L there are so many good alternatives you never feel like you are wasting a turn.

Slightly better than Le Havre because of lots of paths to victory. The resource wheel is another improvement over Le Havre. The best advice is that you should ask other players if they have a building that uses the resources that you want to use. Trying to read across the table is impossible.

One play of the France version and one with Ireland.  Feels like Le Havre with the clunky parts (like feeding every turn) thrown out, and a wider array of choices.  I like it better than Le Havre.  

Components are a little annoying in that it's quite difficult to make out opponents' buildings from across the table (with 20/20 vision).  I did like the rondel as a solution to tracking the number of the various resources that were available.  And the component quality other than the cards was great.

I think that this game is an excellent representative of this style of game, and other than the components, I don't see how I would make it better.  That said, I don't think that this style of "get basic resources which you turn into this to turn into that to get victory points" is really my kind of game.  Probably too much cold calculation without enough randomness to keep the AP at bay.

In Le Havre, which I like very much, there are many paths to victory, but not so many that I cannot analyze them. In Ora I cannot analyze all option and then make decisions within a known tree of options, so it seems to always be game exploration.

I seem to like games with many option, but somewhat more limited choices so that good analysis can be performed, such as Imperial, or Scepter of Zavendor, or Le Havre.

plays pretty well... a tad complicated on the resource production front.  the resource wheel is a well thought out and craft way to increase the resource values.  the sheer amount of buildings and possibilities creates a lot of downtime as people think about their turn.  a good game.

The lack of randomness in game setup and during play reduces replayability in the longer term. Otherwise, the main game mechanic rewards careful planning and can be fulfilling. The quality of the board is not good, as it is very thin and prone to warping/bending. The cards are rather small and having to check every player's buildings as well as those available for construction slows the game down.

Agricola + Le Havre - (some old stuff) + (some new stuff) = Ora et Labora... really enjoyed the puzzle of figuring out which buildings to buy, which to use and what the best layout will be for scoring... another great Uwe!

I'm a bit underwhelmed with games such as Ora et Labora, and its older sibling Le Havre, where all your options feel like good choices. There's no stress, nor fretting over difficult decisions. Instead everyone has a multitude of great options available and the game feels a bit too light-hearted to me. You just seem to stumble over points in Ora et Labora, and never feel stressed about obtaining the food and little energy needed for your next settlement. I prefer the stress of the Harvest phase in Agricola any day!

Ora et Labora should nonetheless see frequent play if I know my gaming buddies well enough, but when it's my turn to pick I will rather play something else. That said, I look forward to another 3-4 plays before cementing my final opinion.

Good game, not a huge amount of player interaction, boards & rules could have been on thicker card/paper, but still enjoyable to play.

Great game. The components are a little disappointing, but not terrible. This may be a 10 or may be a 9, time will have to tell. Currently I have absolutely no problem playing it and don't foresee that changing in the future. If I had to choose between this and Agricola, I'd be pretty torn. They do fulfill different niches though.

I dig it.  Timing your supplies for the settlement phase is a nice challenge.  Nobody's fighting you for that settlement you want to build, because everyone has the same ones available; however, that means everyone's potentially scrabbling for the same resources and actions to make them happen.  Very cool.

After 1 Play: A little better than Le Havre, but not much.  Still too little interaction for a game of this length, but the differentiation of players is much better as the game goes on (it's much more important who builds a particular building, not just whether it's built).

No sé quién lo dijo ya, pero el juego es pura glotonería para los que nos gusta las mecánicas de construir, producir y manufacturar cosas, ganar dinero y crecer sobre un tablero -  En éste, cuando el tablero se te queda pequeño te compras otro, y otro, y otro más...  Aquí sólo hay prosperidad y números en verde para todos. Nada de primas de riesgo ni caras tristes. 

Tras leer las impresiones de otros foreros sobre el OeL, fue decepcionante oír las feroces críticas con respecto a su calidad precio, su extrema semejanza a sus papás, y en particular a sus delgados y combados tableros. Admito que lo compré con la mala conciencia de ir a adquirir un seudónimo del Le Havre con unos componentes endebles y caros... 

Pero chicos, qué queréis que os diga. No estoy de acuerdo con vosotros.

Para empezar no hay barquitos, hay asentamientos. Ya sé que a muchos el tema les resbala - lo que me parece estupendo, cada uno que se lo pase bien como quiera y pueda- pero para los que les guste meterse en el asunto les puedo garantizar que van a descubrir un color nuevo, igualmente tornasolado y lleno de candor como nos tienen acostumbrados las ilutraciones de Klemens Franz. En cuanto a la función de dichos asentamientos, se juegan desde la propia mano y el rol que desempeñan en el juego no tiene ninguna relación con la de exportar productos u obtener comida de la del Le Havre. Construimos asentamientos donde mejor puedan aprovechar los edificios que hayamos construido en un entorno.

En el OeL la adquisición de edificios es mucho más abierta para los jugadores, sin tener que localizar y trazar una ruta para conseguir tal o cuál carta entre las pilas de oferta del Le Havre. Todo está al alcance de todos. Las limitaciones están dadas por el tipo de terreno despejado que tenemos disponible en nuestros tableros. Es labor nuestra estudiar bien su topografía y las jugadas que podemos trazar en sus espacios relacionando cartas, asentamientos y guardando recursos de madera y turba para el futuro.

Todo esto es nuevo, no lo tiene el Le Havre - Ojalá-.

Aquí ves donde está el molino, la cantera, el huerto,.... Hay costa, llano, colinas,... Pero si al final te queda un Belén capitalista chulísimo. Con sus bosques, sus ciénagas. Cuando todo se queda pequeño abres nuevos horizontes añadiéndo más pintura al cuadro: Por aquí más playa, que se oigan a las gaviotas, que entre el Sol. Este bosque no lo quito, que queda de miedo al lado del palacio. ¡Ya está en la oferta de construcciones el castillo! ¡Vamos a hacerle hueco entre las montañas!Y cuando colocas los asentamientos empieza el jolgorio: Chabolas, mercaderes, artistas,...
                       
En el Le Havre no existe ese sentido del espacio. Es algo que he estado buscando desde hace tiempo; un juego económico de construcción donde puedas disponer físicamente los edificios en un entorno. Lo ansiaba encontrar en el Urban Sprawl pero las criticas que se vertieron sobre él en el foro me hicieron ponerlo en cuarentena - Aunque sospecho que no se ha jugado lo suficiente como para merecer lo que se dijo de él. Tal vez algún día le dé una oportunidad-.

No nos obsesionemos por catalogar y juzgar sus mecánicas para saber en qué cajón abandonarlo, de que padre y qué madre ha salido. Entiendo que los que sólo miran su funcionamiento puedan verse superados por las reminiscencias que les pueda llevar al Le Havre. Aquí es donde podemos hablar del tema de la producción y la manufacturación de productos. Y qué si se parece al Le Havre. 

Pero caballeros, si el juego lo ha concebido el mismo autor qué problema hay en que recoja un elemento tan dinámico, y sobretodo, tan divertido como ese para ofrérnoslo en el OeL. No ha sido un cortar y pegar. Está perfectamente bien integrado con el juego espacial de las cartas en el tablero. El sistema no ha perdido ni una hoja al tranplantarlo al lenguaje del OeL. Y aún así presenta su genuino aroma: Las cadenas de producción parecen más cortas que las del Le Havre pero el espectro es mucho más amplio y rico por la vasta variedad de productos que ofrece el juego. 

Me quedo sin hablar de la fantástica adición del rondel de Uwe. Pura elegancia, como apuntaba nuestro amigo Gelete. Muy fresco, con la sencillez de todo lo genial.

El OeL se aprende en un plis viéndolo funcionar.

Cuando hay que pasar la ronda se mueve el dial del rondel un paso y ¡Volilà! por arte de magia todos los recursos en juego ven multiplicado su número.  Fin del misterio.

Las cartas indican lo que has de gastar para llevarlas a tu terreno y también el efecto que puedes jugar si colocas uno de tus clérigos sobre ellas. Facilísimo. 

Las parcelas de campos muestran claramente su precio y los tipos de terreno que contienen. Nada más.

Lo que constituye la verdadera curva de aprendizaje - y no es nada pronunciada - es el desconocer qué cartas tomar de la oferta al comenzar. Pero eso forma parte del placer de comprar un juego con cartas e ir conociendo sus usos y combinaciones poco a poco.
              
No es nada difícil enfrentarse al OeL. En nada te ves envuelto en la vorágine del culto al ladrillo, partiendo de una granjucha y un mohoso monasterio perdido en un descampado, pasando por ir cortando bosques con una inconsciencia e insensibilidad pasmosas, a levantar edificios infringiendo todas las leyes de costas y añadir servicios para sacar el máximo provecho de la gente que viene a instalarse a tus tierras. Acojonante lo que acabo de escribir ¡Se trata de construir tu propio Benidorm!

Finalmente, queda por tratar el tema de la calidad de los componentes. Ey, las fichas de los recursos son fantásticas - y su diseño, delicioso -, y hay montones de ellas.  El rondel tiene un grosor importante. Bueno, sólo hay un pasador, pero sólo vamos a usar uno por partida. Tal vez eso deteriore y afloje a la larga el giro del dial pero eso significará que lo habréis jugado mucho y su precio habrá sido bien amortizado. 

Sí, sí, los tableros son finos. Y los míos estaban combados, pero nada que no solucione una buena sesión de estiramientos cartulinescos antes de empezar a jugar - ¿Soy el único que les hace estiramientos a los tableros? -. Cuando has llenado media mesa de cartas te olvidas de esas pequeñeces. Sólo ves un monasterio y toda la riqueza que atesora a su alrededor. Lo has hecho tú solito. Podría haber sido mejor si tu oponente no hubiera emborrachado a tu prior con ese vino barato para que trabajase para él. Pero bueno, son gajes de eso de Orar y laborar.

No identifico OeL con Le Havre. No los identifico más entre sí ni tienen más razones para sentirse como postizas variaciones de un sistema que las que podría tener para referirme por ejemplo al Path of Glory respecto al HIS - o a cualquier otro juego de guerra que junte cartas, counters y mapas como For the People, etc... -. ¿Y qué si se parecen? Más razones para quererlos todos ¿Dónde está esa ley en el cielo que dice que está feo que se parezcan en cosas?

A nivel personal, el único fallo que le veo es que al no tener ni un gramo de azar, las cartas se conocen y están marcadas por letras por orden de aparición, no se barajan -¡Un juego con cartas que no se barajan!   -y porque la disposición del tablero con sus bosques es idéntica para todos, temo que la rejugabilidad del modo solitario se resienta.

It turns out that I'll probably play this one solo more than anything else, and it also turns out that I quite enjoy playing it solo.  There's nothing random about solitary play; it's all a puzzle to be solved.  That's good; I like that.  My highest solo score at this time (Mar2013) is 368, so it'll be some time before I unlock the puzzle and break 500 points.

乌玫瑰山的第四部关于建设和交换收益的作品。和前几部有明显的区别，食物需求不再是负担，玩家可以将思路尽量放在拿分方面。虽然游戏设计了2种不同模式，但是耐玩性方面因为每次开局及过程设置都一样，比起前作农场主和勒阿弗尔来说耐玩度稍有降低。

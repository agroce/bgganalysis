This dominion and chess marriage seems a bit gimmicky... but it works. The game manages to maintain the tactical puzzle of abstract games and adds deck-building, with all its intricacies, into it. Furthermore, neither the deck-building or abstract element feels more important... a thoughtful balance is key at winning the game. And because of the mechanical nature of the game, luck feels quite limited. The end result is something brain-burning, novel, easy to teach, and fluid to play.

Simply put, I like this game quite a bit and could see my rating of it increasing. If I had to complain, the production quality isn't quite at the level of other publisher and situations may arise where the game drags on (just like in Chess). But other than that, the design is quite impressive and I can't wait until my next game.

What you probably already know: It's the deck-building of Dominion merged with Chess.
What you may have heard: It works surprisingly well!

Both these are true.  I'm not a huge chess fan, despite it being a very good game.  There is something about chess that makes me uncomfortable.  It comes with a lot of  baggage.  As a battle of wits, I always feel dumb when I lose.  

For The Crown still feels very Chess-like.  I mean.  It's pretty much Chess.  But the deck-building elements plus a few other significant tweaks to the game system are really cool.  There are a lot of clever bits of timing to consider since you can almost never move a piece and deploy a new piece to the board in the same turn (In case you were unaware - each side begins with only their king on the board, and can bring new pieces in through card play).

possible downsides is that sometime the deck-building can distract from the battle on the board, making the experience feel somewhat disconnected.  There were a few times in my first play where I just wanted to do the pieces on the board stuff and the card-play felt like just a distraction.  Especially in the later phase of the game when both sides had plenty of pieces already out and in play.

Length of play will certainly dependent on how easy-breezy or super serious you are.  I had trouble getting out of the mind-set that usually accompanies my chess game - which left me staring at the board for extended periods of time.  So my first game went 3 hours.

RATING: 9.5
Although IÂ´m not very good in it, I really like chess. But I never was too interested in learning all the opening theory, it always felt too scripted for me. I prefer the middle and especially the end game in chess. Now, For the Crown starts with the endgame and moves to the middle game. And, if you like chess, it is so much fun! I really enjoy this one very much.

Based on my initial play:

If you love chess like I do, you will definitely want to take a look at this game. Although I am not a big fan of Dominion, I found the deckbuilding part intricate and challenging. The process of how you deploy your pieces, bring them into play, build up your deck to buy them and perform certain actions brings a new dimension into chess. I don't know if some of the "super pieces" are balanced or if some of the actions provided by the cards are too strong, but they seem to be fine and add a different flavor and aspect to the game of chess. That will take a few more plays to determine.

 What I do know is that while I was playing, I was having fun, I was engaged and I immediately felt that it would take a bit of a learning curve to pan out the tactics and strategies offered by the mechanics of the game. I don't know if the novelty will wear out, but being enamored with chess I doubt it.

Edit: 2nd game was tight and tense. Upped the rating by .25

This works way better than such a mashup has any right to - the tension between deck improvement and board control is fantastic, the escalation from a single King to a customized army is a great-feeling arc, and the monkeywrenches the cards throw into standard chess abilities are enough to keep you on your toes but not so chaotic as, eg, Knightmare Chess. (Plus, you know what your opponent has bought, so you can try to plan around it.)

Downsides:
 * Between players of roughly equal skill, midgame can be a very long slog. I close the store (no more card acquisition) after 5 or 6 piles are depleted - it's not always even relevant, but it prevents the extremely long games that I've seen turn some players off of playing again.
 * Having extra Sovereign units available does really interesting things to play... but can also extend the game a fair bit. I may start using those cards again now that I've hit upon the "close the store" trick, but will do so cautiously.
 * The tokens are laser-cut, which is nicely accurate but leaves soot on all the  edges. Plan on spending half an hour cleaning them off after punching the game, or every play will result in dirty, smudgy fingers.

RATING: 7
Brilliant love child of Dominion and Chess. I actually like playing the game more than the rating would indicate, but I've docked points due to:

Time -- Some games can go very long and can be tiresome. I use a chess clock at 45 min./player to fix this.

Blitzing -- If you can keep putting the opponent's Sovereign (that's King) in check (particularly early in the game), it can be difficult for the opponent to get pieces onto the board. There are some cards that can mitigate this. Not certain if this is a real issue or due to poor play, but I have to rate this based on my experience.

This is a very clever game that combines Chess with deckbuilding.  I'm not sure it's for me---after trying it, I thought "the designer did some really ingenious things" but not "Let's set it up again and play again."  But some people will really like it.

This is a great design that I have no desire to play. If you like chess at all, you must try this. I despise chess, so this annoyed me in all the same ways that chess does--but I thoroughly enjoyed the deckbuilding aspect before the chess frustration set in.

RATING: 8
The melding of Chess and Dominion has somehow created something greater than the sum of the parts -- such a simple idea creates such interesting ripples. The card play opens up the Chess play right up, and the chess board provides real pressure in terms of the card play breaking into a probabilistic game of economy-to-VP turn point (e.g., because it has a chess board, you can't even forget the pawns -- the threat of promotion to any available unit that game is simply too big). There are opportunities to make additional and/or non-conventional moves with traditional units, as well as all new units which are differential permutations of classic units -- but what you can do and can buy has a lot to do with what you draw. There's no hand-holding in this game, and it's all-the-more beautiful for it -- the game encourages and rewards risky plays. I think my rating will go up if I can sustain more plays -- I'm looking forward to seeing how games develop with other sets of cards on the table.

Literally "Chess meets Dominion." If you don't care for either, I don't expect this game will change your mind. However, if you do enjoy them, this game is an absolute gem! Now if only I can find someone to play it with...

So far with the initial games I've played with someone, one player sees the deck-builder aspect so they start to fill their deck with a ton of money cards. Which is great, but unlike Dominion, won't win you the game.

This game has committed double homicide....
RIP Dominion
RIP Chess

 I know it was modeled after(to the point of nearly copying some cards)Dominion, which I am lukewarm about, but this game is miles and miles better. FTC has taken two themeless games and given them a point....I am building a deck of cards for the PURPOSE of building an army and defeating my enemy.  There is real strategy in which cards to buy and why, there are real tactical decisions on when to use them and when to train them into units.It is a perfect balance of building your engine and keeping the pressure on your opponent.  Aggressive play is a must...

Although the idea is kinda lame and the production is horrible, the game is actually quite fun.


There's a lot of strategies that seem viable, although most of the strategical aspects of the game are found in the deckbuilding part, whereas the tactical aspect is found in board position.

Game also seems a tad long, at around 90-120 mins.

RATING: 6
The combination of deckbuilding and chess works. For the Crown manages to incorporate the two different challenges of both games. Building an efficient deck is a prerequisite for having a good force of 'chess' pieces on the board and being able to move them according to their potential. Setting up a strong position and strategically planning ahead your movement is the true challenge for any non-chess player.

While blending both elements successfully and offering deep gameplay, For the Crown is too much for me. As in Chess, games can evolve in long slow games if both players are skilled or degenerate in the opposite, a complete blowout. Getting skilled at this game is almost like getting good at chess. Given my limited enthusiasm for both origins of For the Crown, I'd rather play something less elaborated with a less steep learning curve.

Shockingly well-done.

First play-through went a bit long (2 hours or so) but I imagine it shortens with experience.

Felt truly like Dominion meets Chess, so if you like both of those games you'll almost certainly like this one.

The game provides you with a lot of interesting tactics to win with...

Only complaint is the quality of the components (for some reason the copy we played smelled like bacon).

Second play-through: felt like it lacked replay value... getting a 2nd King seems essential to winning.  In the end, power overcomes strategy.

Perhaps with more familiarity we could shorten play time a bit but so far it's clocking in at around three hours which is simply unacceptable: it's just too slow to develop, repetitive, and ultimately exhausting. A shame, because I really admire the audacious chess/deck builder hybrid nature of the game and am fairly pleased with its physical quality. Ultimately I'd much rather play [i]The Duke[/i], which satisfies the same itch in a considerably shorter time frame. [2 plays; sold]

So many parts of the this game are executed so well.  The game is full of beautifully emergent dilemmas and tough trade-offs.  The cards are very well balanced with only a few easily-excluded exceptions.  It is a fantastic game, and by far my highest rated 2 player game (which I rarely get to play).

My only criticism is that the mid-game can drag a bit, which is easily fixed by having the "store close" when 4 (or maybe 5) stacks have run out.  At that point, just play with the cards you've got.  That keeps the game moving at a good pace, and doesn't seem to interfere with the existing balance and tension.

It also may be important to remove or tone down Guard -- it's not broken, but it encourages standoffs.

Abstract, which is not my cup of tea normally. However, the mix with Dominion deck-building seems a great twist. 

I don't like Dominion because it is all about deck building which suddenly turns into a dreadful VP grabbing. I don't like Chess because of the long buildup and it is always very, very long.

This keeps the deck building, but swaps out the VP grabbing into a more involved game of asymmetric Chess. Playtime does worry me a bit, but I can see this becoming a classic that I can break out to ANYONE that suggest a game of Chess.

Without a doubt one of the most genius games I have ever played. I believe that the deck building mechanic meshes with the chessboard and units in a very interesting fashion. I was once an avid chess player (if not that skilled), and after playing For the Crown, I don't think I'll ever go back to "standard" chess, because the decisions in FTC are much more compelling and definitely a lot less scripted than the mountains of theory that accompany chess. I hope that more expansions come out in the future, but the base game already has an immense amount of replayability. Perhaps the only downside may come from players taking too long on their turn, which will without a doubt happen on the first game or so. Fantastic overall, and truly one of the gems of my collection!

[b]Finally[/b], I have played this.  It strangely reminds me of the feeling of playing Baby Pac-Man: You play one game (the deckbuilding) that more or less drives the other (the tactical).  What really matters is the maneuvering on the board, but the deckbuilding provides units, gives them movement advantages, protection, etc. and really adds layers to the decision-making.  Better still, each card has two effects between which you must choose, and with extremely few exceptions (to be found in expansions), training a unit in order to make it available in your barracks to deploy later means trashing the training card.  Sure, sure, makes sense, can't just keep training the same type of unit, but you also throw away a potent action or order or treasure effect with it, and the former two tend to pertain to that class of unit.  So many decisions!  Yay!

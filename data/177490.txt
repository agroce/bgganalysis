A very interesting take on worker placement, similar in a strange way to Tokaido (last player always plays next), but my group did not seems to enjoy it too much. The game is fun and competitive, it could have better balance and it could definitely use better graphics.

There is an interesting mechanism at the heart of the game, that is kind of a twist on the get there quickly and get better stuff and have to wait. But the board seeding is random, so that might not be the case. The amount of text reading required is annoying and there is some petty take-that type stuff going on. Oof, I didn't enjoy playing this one.

2015-10-18 : The problem with this game is that there are virtually no choices to be made in it. You need tools, so you get them, then you go for the buildings that give you the most points. Pretty bog-standard but with the nice twist that actions also cost a variable amount of time - nothing new, but nicely done. That's the good part.

But what I don't understand is why in 2015 the graphics and layout of a game can still be so lousy. A and B in Gothic script, virtually indistinguishable from across the table - really guys ? Same with the red tools. And then the icons for the building effects .. ugh - too small again. Listen you graphic designers : if you do layout and graphics with your nose near a 21 inch screen, bloody well remember people playing the game will be 2 feet removed from it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A reasonably interesting filler with a time mechanism. Each turn the player at the top of the NOW track takes their turn and moves their disc into the future and takes an action. But then they have to wait till their future spot becomes NOW again for that worker(s) to activate. 

Sometimes you can use your workers separately for different actions and sometimes you have to pool them together to reach a higher lever tile (a 1-lvl worker can take a level 1 tile, 2-lvl worker can take level 2, and your 1- and 2-lvl workers can pool to take a level 3 tile, etc.).

The point of it all is to first take requisite tools and then take tiles (that you can reach and have the matching tools for) for VPs. The game starts with 30 tiles and they don't refresh; when they're gone, the game simply ends. 

It was OK, nothing to hate but nothing to yearn to play again. There are many other fillers I'd rather play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating after only one play by the correct rules, so judge accordingly.

Like many Cwali games (Logistico, Sun, Sea, and Sand) there is virtually no luck after the initial setup, which is interesting in its own way.

I find the time management aspect of this game to be very intriguing, and the turns tend to go by very quickly.  There are 30 tiles, and 6 tools per player.  So a typical game is about 30 turns plus about 10 turns per player (you can lose and regain tools, and pregnancy consumes a turn or two in a typical game).  The winner will be the person who can spot the best compromise between gathering tools and building tiles that suit the tools taken so far, while reacting to her opponents as they attempt the same thing.

The variability comes from the setup; only 30 of the 36 tiles are in any given game (in my limited experience, most or all tiles in play get built in a game), the tools are randomly distributed, and of course the buildings themselves are randomly distributed.

There are a few "take that" tiles that harm all of your opponents at once.  If that bugs you, just leave them out of the mix.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Samara is easy to explain and nice to play. The timetrack is fun aspect of the game and there a some nice tactictal choices to make when you decide which worker(s) you want to use.

I would have loved to see some synergy between the different tiles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent game where you first have to collect tools to later build buildings. Both the gathering tools and the building cost workforce (number of workers needed to perform the action) and time (number of months your workers cannot be re-used after performing the action). In the end the prestige-points of the buildings determine the winner.

A bit strange that 'easy' buildings (like a hut or haystack, which require no special tools but give no advantages) give more prestige than 'complex' buildings (like the university, which requires several specialized tools and gives permanent advantages to its owner), but this balances the game perfectly. As a random set of 30 buildings, each with its own (dis)advantages, is used and spread across the board at random, each game plays (a bit) differently.

Initial rating after two back-to-back 3P games.  I like that the puzzle element of it, but it was not so much that I felt the need to optimize every play.  A key decision is how much time to invest in gaining a useful set of tools versus building the buildings you are already equipped for.

Expansion #1 is highly recommended.  The secret goals give a bit of direction to your play.

Has a similar problem to many auction games-- if you start the game knowing how to evaluate the tiles, you can find bargains and run away with it. The combination of dry Euro planning and occasional anti-player screwage also made it feel a little like punishment to me.

Ingenious mechanic, nice production, just too many of the wrong ingredients.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another light and easy game from Cwali that offers something different. This time it's all about the time-track and how it changes the normal worker placement mechanic.

The game is completely straight foward, but there are still some thing to consider, which kept the game away from being downright boring. Yeah, there isn't much to it, as you only take equipment to build buildings, but it can be somewhat cutthroat which keeps the game going.

Nothing really special here, but a fun light family game.

Rated this game based on a play of a prepress copy at Ducosim (gaming convention). Gameplay feels very smooth and provides plenty of interesting decisions, especially when u take the game duration into consideration. The time mechanic feels clever and elevates the game above a run-of-the-mill euro. It gracefully gives players a nice balancing choice between time needed to get more turns and what they want to pickup from the playing board. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. For me the game was a pleasant surprise and from now on; I surely would like to play it again, without any hesitations.

RATING: 5
Played with two. I think there are particular problems at that number. If one player ends up choosing to take a tile further out, the other player can really take advantage and gobble up intervening tiles one month at a time. This really limits your choice and flexibility. Needs more players to break this up. 

In some ways, I feel like this is a neat mechanic in search of game. There just isn't enough variation in game play to keep me wanting to come back. And even though the way it is presented may feel new, it actually feels more like another way of implementing the Neuland/Thebes action mechanic, where the player last on the time track takes the next move. What Samara adds to the time mechanic is worker strength. Tiles require a strength of 1-4 to take, and so there are ways to group your workers or enhance your workers to meet the strength requirement. Despite selling the "time" aspect of the game pretty hard, the strength aspect is what feels more fresh and original to  me. A little reminiscent of Stone Age, but implemented differently enough to stand on its own.

Cool ideas that need to have more implication than simply "which tiles am I allowed to take".

The expansions certainly mix things up a bit and I did purchase the kickstarter. That being said, I'm uncertain if this one will have longevity in my collection. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Can't decide if I will kickstart this one or not. I enjoyed my first play and think the time track is quite an interesting mechanic, but I'm not certain there is enough variety in the buildings to keep this game fresh. With only 36 buildings, of which 30 are used, that doesn't provide a ton of variety. The game is typical Cwali game with a simple rule set that frees you up to consider your action choices without worrying about fiddliness, etc.

The time track is certainly unique, and it makes for some important timing decisions.  Besides that, the game is mainly focusing on getting tools, and then grabbing the most profitable buildings.  But again, the focus is manipulating the time track.

RATING: 5.8
Preliminary rating, based on 2-player games:

The time-track mechanism is great. The first expansion with the special buildings is an automatic include: it gives a bit more challenge. Haven't tried the 2nd expansion yet.

The mediocre rating is based on the end-game: when all the tools are out and all the big-points buildings are gone, it's just a matter of 'administration' and trying to get as much low-point buildings as possible.

Right now it feels like a very light family game with a little bit of interaction. Maybe there should be some more competition between (2) players. I guess the end-game gets shorter with more players, so I still need to try it with more players.

Played a prototype of this game. Details have changed, but it was far enough finished to give it a tentative rating. I found it a very smart game. Simple rules, but plenty of choices and decisions to be made. The way the timetrack is implemented here is unique, as far as I know. You have multiple workers going at the time track, it makes the timetrack from say, Tinner's trail look simple and one dimensional. I am looking forward to play the finished game.

I quite liked the way this game uses time as a resource players had to manage as they send their workers out hither and yon to get stuff and build things. My one play was with five players and I found that the lack of any form of balancing mechanism for the fourth and fifth player really detracted from the enjoyment as the first few players got the pick of the easily gettable stuff that didn't take much time to acquire while those at the sewer end of player order had to spend longer to get their engine set up. Might play again but wouldn't seek it out.

RATING: 6.5
Samara has a clever mechanism of collecting building tiles based on two axes: time and strength (number of workers). The buildings give VPs and some other benefits.
The game moves along swiftly and smoothly until the closing stages when there are just a few buildings left. At this point players can spend a lot of moves just to get a building or pass and leave the remaining player(s) to sweep up the VPs. WHY? Why after such a great game does it end so clunkily? If the game ended immediately there were only 4 tiles left, then I would have given this a much higher rating.
I will happily play it again but with a house rule to bring the game to a swift conclusion.

The childish art and the far-fetched theme speaks against Samara. Behind this, however, is a game with a rather unique time/space mechanism. For each month on the time track, there is a column of tiles. The further on the time track you move your worker, the longer you have to wait to act again, and the more workers you gather on the same month, the higher tiles in the column you may take. There is also an engine aspect to the game, as you may acquire workers and tools to further your strategy. Somehow it feels like the mechanic could have been used to something more interesting but it's still a challenging puzzle where the players keep getting in each others' way.

I bought this on a whim when I ordered from the Funagain sale. I heard a lot of good things at LT and wanted to see for myself. Played a few times and can't say I enjoyed it all that much with 2p. it was fine, the expansion bits might add a better race to the game. In the 4p game there is so much to account for and you really have to plan accordingly if you want to get what you are aiming for. I really like the KS addons for the end goal cards- it really gives a focus and that is a nice addition.

Samara has all of the right parts to be a good game, but the gsmeplay ends up being a little basic and Straight-forward.

The time track mechanic has a lot of potential.

Perfect information game that still has some good player interaction and timing aspects, although the take-that systems felt a bit out-of-place.
It felt fairly elegant, and the random tile-placement should mean that games will be significantly different depending upon which rows various buildings appear, although I would be concerned that there may be a runaway leader problem.

RATING: 6
1 play

The board is a random collection of buildings. Skill tokens are also placed on several spaces. Players each start the game with 2(3?) workers but may recruit more later. The worker furthest back (and leftmost) on the time track goes next: advance to a different row on the track, and take a relevant action on the matching board row (acquire a skill, build a building). Once built, buildings may give you a _wide_ variety of powers or cause in-game/end-game effects/VP. The time track has a few twists, too:
- you have multiple workers who may be spread over the track
- the track is in 2 halves (6 months each), which cycle in a way that makes the June/July transition kind of a weird one (i.e., have a baby in the shortest time if you do it in June?)

You have to balance getting the skills you need with acquiring the VP-generating buildings (while guarding against the attack powers). The game is quick (too quick for me) -- you likely do NOT need every skill! Like many Euros, you need to find the right time to transition between mostly skill-gaining to mostly VP-gaining.

Pretty good, but I prefer:
- longer games
- less take-that
- a bit of in-game randomness (this one is all in the setup).

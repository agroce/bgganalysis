Cute little game with lots of randomness but some neat mechanics to mitigate the luck of the draw. That being said, you might go an entire game without seeing the card you need once, so the luck factor is still very much there. I do like the game for its shortness, its quick set-up, and its extreme portability (at half the size of even most tiny card games). I just wouldn't want to play this all the time.

What a shame. A small action point allowance system in a portable package. But in practice repetitive, boring, and without genuine tension. Just move, take a card, move, put down a card, perhaps rummage about in a deck to look for a [i]good[/i] card which gives you a nice bonus or something, change walking direction to annoy the other players, grab fuel, and move again some more, ad finitum. This would have been so much better had there been some genuine choices to pursue in the game... But alas, it was not to be. Broke off the attempt half way through and have not looked back since.

It's so small! And it makes a cute little layout. And you feel like you're accomplishing something, even with the restrictions of only 4 little actions per turn, and three little cards in your hand. The recycling action is especially fun.  Be sure to get the rocket tip bonuses and high-value fuel to do well, I think. I don't know for sure - I've done poorly in all five games I've played. It doesn't have much interaction, so may do well as a "beat your old score" solitaire.

A great, portable little game. The first time I played this with my 6-year-old, he had the ability to go both directions and I didn't, and without blinking he spent a point to turn the arrow around to frustrate the movement he saw I was about to make. Fantastic. 
Update: This game has aged very well. It's a great little game, and I foresee it staying in our collection indefinitely.

What a super little game packed into this 3 1/2" x 3 1/2" box.

There is luck with which cards come up but it is offset by a delightful screw-you ability.  When rockets are completed, points are earned and perhaps special abilities.

Rules are easy to learn, play is 20 mins, and the game is colorful and attractive.

It is a great game to pack in the suitcase but not to play on the plane or car because the layout takes needs room. 

This is most similar to Asara, which I also like.

A little filler that carries its biggest virtue right on the box: a very small footprint. The game is okay for 20 minutes, I guess, but even in that short time it tends to get a little repetitive. It's not like players have a lot of choices of what to do with their actions.

It really does fit in your pocket! The portability of this game is great. One can take it almost anywhere, and it is short enough that one could play it on a work break, for example.

The game is fun too. You build rockets, and race to get the most valuable fuel tokens for a launch. There is a simple action point mechanic that works fairly well.

A nice, quick filler.

A great little filler that is easy to teach and learn, with a good amount of luck, but some fun decisions to make.  I enjoy the rocket-building theme, as thin as it is, as well as the quick play time.

I am a little bit concerned about the power of certain actions.  The recycling in particular seems very powerful, as do some of the rocket tips.  But in our game, the winner made do without both of those actions, so it looks like the luck of the card draw can mitigate those factors.  But for a short little filler I think it is pleasingly fun.

A nice fun little filler game. There are better ones in my collection, but watching the rockets go up on the table is quite an enjoyable experience. A 6, because well...it is a filler, not really a deep game, and while I will play it again, any more than about 2 plays in a row and it would drive me crazy. Still, high recommendation. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice filler, using action points to move around a circular track, activating the track spaces and building rockets with what you pick up. There are a few piles of cards to pick up rocket pieces up from (ie cards showing base, tip and fuselage in different colours), then specific spaces where you're allowed to build (ie place in your tableau) cards in a specific colour, building from a base up. Other spaces allow you to search decks, claim bonus points for completed rockets and reverse turn direction. There's some really nice decisions to make each turn, the major restrictions being you must move always in the one direction (as per the direction space) and your hand size is three. Leading to the challenge of whether to suck up doing a circuit to get a nice card you need (assuming it'll still be there) or whether to do blind draw type moves in the hope it'll be more efficient. There's also the tradeoff of whether to do lots of rockets or just a few big rockets, as only the fuselages score. As you can see, lots of nice decisions smacked into a filler type timeframe. There's lots of luck as well (eg what's on top of each pile when it comes to your turn), but managing around that luck is the fun and given the timeframe, entirely reasonable.

For a small footprint filler, there is a lot of game in this box. I would loosely interpret this game as the 15 minute version of "Asara". Use your 4 actions to take rocket parts, build the parts, take fuel, reverse movement direction or switch cards. Take the best parts before everyone else...but wait to long to build them and you might lose out on the best fuel to launch them. There's a fair dose of strategy with a dash of luck mixed into this game and the artwork has a sort of "retro-steampunk" feel to it. Highly recommended as a filler, if you can pick it up for a few dollars.

[Asmodée 2009 edition] {Space; set-collection, action-point; scalable} Pocket Rockets is a handy travel game. It is fast-paced and fun. Player interaction is quite good.  Nothing special but it is an ok game given its price and size. Decisions are not very simple - players have to adjust their tactics according to the rockets being built by opponents.  It is a nice game.

The production quality is ok.  Colorful cards with good illustration. The Fuel Tokens should have number on it to indicate the marks.  Each fuselage should have icons / numbers to show that it is worth 2 victory points.

Pros: Compact and easy to travel with.
Great steampunk theme and artwork.
A decent amount of strategy.

Cons: Limited card variety.
Confusing to teach.

Conclusion: Pockets Rockets is a simple and breezey game that appeals to what I look for the most: Compact, fast, some good strategy.  It's a great game to travel with although it needs to be played with 3-4 people.  A nice pickup.

Small box, small cards, great game, plus sexual innuendo. Recycling make take a bit of time, but other than that the game moves smoothly. Plenty of decisions to make with a small ruleset and limited options. Plays different with 2,3 or 4. I like 3 best currently.

I'm really surprised that this game doesn't get more interest than it does. It's an Antione Bauza game for starters. Not to mention it's actually quite a fun little filler game. Tiny box, and bam there's a game in there. Thing is this came out before the recent buzz of "micro games" otherwise it'd probably be HUGE.

The game plays perfectly fine from 2 to 4 players. Nothing really changes except maybe the direction doesn't change quite a much before you next turn. Neat game design, and I think this one should get more notice than it does.

Pocket Rockets is a quick filler game about building rockets.  It feels a lot like Asara to me.  I enjoyed this game... but I wanted more!  The way this game is set up it encourages building a lot of ships over building longer ships.  I'd love if the game lasted just a tad longer to give the longer-ship strategy a little bit more potential.  It's not a bad game, but it tickles an itch that it doesn't quite satisfy.

Although I LOVE the portability of this game (the box is really, really tiny), and I definitely like the theme and the simple rules, I hate to admit that it lacks excitement with two. The first couple of rounds, messing about with the conveyor belt is good fun, but after that recycling through the cards hoping to get the right missile parts gets a bit tedious. With two, the chance that you will both get an equal amount of fuel tokens is considerable, so in the end it is just a matter of who makes the largest missile and who gets the most of the +1 missile tops (both a matter of drawing the right cards at the right time). Rating will probably change after I got the chance to play this with more players.

This really impressed me. At less than $10 it's basically a must buy, as there's quite a bit of game here. The idea is simple, but there are just enough little mechanics to make the experience fun. Highly recommended (obviously, since I ordered this after my first play).

It is a nice little game. But if one player has the good luck to get one of the better bonus cards early in the game it quickly gets unbalanced.

Entretenido y fácil de jugar, no se le puede pedir más a un juego con un formato tan pequeño. Ideal tanto a dos como hasta 4 jugadores no muy jugones.

I ended up with a copy of this as a math trade sweetener but never worked up the ambition to get it played (too many fillers too little time).  Traded away to a good home where I'm sure it will actually see the table.

Gyors, pörgős, vicces kis kártyajáték. A rakéták építése jó móka, tökéletes levezetés lehet egy hosszabb társasest után.

My favorite thing about this game is that it feels like a big experience in a tiny box. The game is largely about timing and hand management. It plays quickly, and best with 2 or 3 players. If you enjoy little card games that are off the beaten path (I'm thinking R-Eco, Famiglia, Sobek), then you should give this one a try.

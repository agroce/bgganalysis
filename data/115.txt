RATING: 1
One of the worst gaming experiences - negotiating with strangers made for a bad play.  I've played in cutthroat situations but the power structure/alliances were unbalanced.  Might consider another try some day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played with 5 and had a pretty good time--there were some questions on timing that the rules didn't really seem to address.  I'd definitely like to try it again with 6--it seemed that there were some unfortunate instances where a player was left with no permanent board members and unable to steal any back.

While I like this game, I have to be in the right mood for it.  The card play is what kills me.  If you don't have the right cards, it's hard to do anything.  If you're guys get stolen, you could be basically out of the game while some good deals are going on.  Want to like it more, but don't.

RATING: 7
This is the first negotiation game I've played. So far I've had 2 games with the Penn Gamers and they've been a hoot! I can definitely see that with some people the game could bomb, but if you have a vocal group of players who like to wheel-and-deal, talk crap to each other and hold grudges, then this game is amazing! I haven't laughed so much during a game in a long time.

RATING: 8
Finally found the game for people who want to play Monopoly. This has some roll & move (although it's far less stressful here), it has cards, and most importantly it has negotiation, deal-making, and backstabbing. All this in a short game that plays in under an hour, if that long. The viciousness leads to moments of pure hilarity as two 'I'm The Boss' cards by one player get stopped only for him to play a third...  this might not be the single best game on the planet, but it's the only negotiation game I've played that really gives me the feel of the classic Monopoly without being a tortuous experience.

RATING: 6.5
If I'm in the mood for a negotiation game then this one is very good, very take that in each deal but because it relies on negotiation anyway the random factor of the cards balances out. You then just have to worry about the random factor of people :) Not my idea of a strategy game but good fun for a laugh every now and then.

Rating after one play.  Not sure about this one yet--will need to try it again.  I fear it suffers from everything I hate in Munchkin: so much screwage that you cannot even plan your moves.  You're only as good as the number of countering cards you have and how recent the last big battle was.

RATING: 5
This is definitely a group-game. Some groups this game wouldn't work, but in the group we played with it was fun. Lots of take that, very random. But the negotiating was fun and there were a couple of funny moments.

On the next play I could see this moving down to a 6, depending on how the experience goes, some of the mechanics, you can tell, are dated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
One of those games that opens out when you weren't expecting it.  At first the rules look underweight, but they provide just enough to let the wheeling and dealing get nasty.  A decent game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Every player acts as a character in the game and tries to complete tasks or jobs in the game that requires some other characters in the game.  As you require their help, they can negotiate to get a fair cut for helping in the task.

Special cards can help to replace the work of the characters while other cards can also cancel the these effects.

Good points: Suits a group of rowdy players who likes to argue and negotiate.

Bad points: The game is a little like monopoly which lets players throw dice and moves onto different spaces.  Towards the end of the game, as tasks diminishes, it gets harder to land on uncompleted tasks like monopoly which gets harder to land on unbought property which can be irritating as all tasks must be complete before the game ends.

Personally I really do not like this game as I would just let the task close no matter how much other players would like to have.  I found it pointless to negotiate and the game boring.  However I see others recommend and enjoyed the game, I think it is just that the game is not for me and decided to give it a 5.

RATING: 7
All too realistic portrayal of corporate greed.
One person (The Boss) proposes a deal. They can then be ousted from power, renegotiated into oblivion or get cut out entirely.

It's all table talk, bickering and shouting with a tonne of luck.

It is, therefore, great fun.

If the right group of people play the game then it can be a completely chaotic and hilarious game. Love the tremendous amount of player interaction and the fluidity of the game.

Did have one horrendous session where a group of players simply traded amongst themselves no matter what trades you offered them, simply because they wanted to get it done as quickly as possible.

An intense, backstabbing, negotiation game.  You have to play this one with no grudges or you will be left behind.  The player who backstabs (and when gets backstabbed recovers the quickest) will win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Pros
- Negotiation is fun
- Dealmaking and lying to thwart each other
- Money is in card form
- Money is hidden information 

Cons
- "on vacation" cards and "investor" cards look nearly identical and do different things so players often confuse them 
- Need 5-6 players for it to work best 
- You spend a couple turns negotiating then a couple turns just grabbing cards. It ruins the flow of the game. 

Sold/Traded because:
- brought out too much frustration than fun
- too chaotic for a negotiation game

Very fun negotiation game.  With the right group, this will be a blast!  It took my group an initial game to get into the mood of this.

RATING: 9
Oooooh fun.  

Make sure the game is right for your crowd, though.  Some people could really NOT enjoy this one, if they hold a grudge or need deep strategic gameplay.  This game is best played "off the cuff", wheeling and dealing, full-speed ahead.  And when it is, you'll have a great time.

When this was pulled off the shelf and the game store owner said "Let's play this", I went "sure.".  He said, "nice attitude there."  Whoops.  (it was the new "I'm the Boss" version, and he had not played it either)

Two rounds into the game I'm thinking, oh man, this has "screw you buddy" written all over these cards.  This is MY kind of game!  Another "MUST. HAVE. GAME. NOW." to add to the collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A highly interactive game of deal making.  Masses of take that cards make it quite chaotic.  Elements of timing, hand management and negotiation mitigate the chaos.  Good fun with the right group in the right mood. The Face 2 Face production is very good looking.

RATING: 6
Very much a negotiation game. If you've burned people in the past and they don't trust you now (i.e. you are me) it's nigh impossible to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Some good ideas in this, but in the two games I played I felt that it was a case of building up cards, firing them off, and seeing what was left when the dust settled. Pretty random-- although lots of skill in choosing the timing to use cards, I've no doubt. Not really for me-- but probably edging towards 6/10 for 4p and down to 4/10 for 6p. Generally I'd rather play something else.

Acquired 2/4/07

You really have to be a negotiator and a shark in this game. In a 4 player game we played the winner had twice as much money as the second place player. The winner was also the one who started the most deals and became the boss on one or two others. You also have to be involved in as many deals as possible. It's too hard to accumulate the cards you need to do deals on your own (and defend them), the game ends by the time you can get close to having the right set of cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fantastic negotiation game.  Features a very simple and clean ruleset, making it easy for people to understand whats going on and how to play various cards.  The components leave a bit to be desired (pretty plain and packed in an oversized box).  Plays best with its full accompaniment, especially when people play mean.

RATING: 9
I really like this one, but I must say, it hasn&#039;t hit the table in a long time.  Even so, worst case scenario, I might knock it down to an 8.  It&#039;s not for everyone, but what makes this negotiation game shine is that no deal carries over into the next one... so there&#039;s essentially no backstabbing.  Yeah, there might be some cutthroat card play, but then you make that deal and move on, no hard feelings.  At least, that how it works when I play it:)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating based on two plays.  

I was really impressed with this.  It was an aggressive negotiation game, but no one seemed to take it personally when they got screwed out of a deal.

I think the card play system was a key here.  Most of the screwing over happened because someone had the right card to sabotage a deal and not because someone was playing favorites or because someone got lied to.

The card system offers lots of light but interesting choices.  You have to weigh when the card is worth playing and when it's worth keeping as a threat.

it can be an interesting framework for player interaction, but the game itself doesn't seem to have much staying power.  i'd still play it again and enjoy it, but i'm left waiting for a light, short game that is heavy on negotiation.  unfortunately, bohnanza isn't it for me.  i'm actually leaning toward light take-that stuff along the lines of mag-blast to scratch that itch since i posted these comments.

This is a classic Sackson style family game.  There are definite "take-that" elements to the game, but these are not really too hard to accept as there are enough counter-actions available to offer some defensive options.  The game is all about negotiations and they can be brutal.  It is this aspect that makes the game hit or miss.  Fun and game duration will depend entirely on who is playing.  With a group of likeable souls, its a fun banter.  With Trumps playing for "real" money, its torture.  [GTI Code: TGSL]

RATING: 7
Definitely not for the analytical types.  I was surprised by really enjoying this as I'm typically not a negotiation mechanic lover.  The downside is that it's extremely tactical and you can't do a lot of planning.  I'm looking forward to a second play to see if this was just a fluke.

A solid 8 if not higher. Just plain fun to play, often eliciting "Let's play it again" reactions from new gamers. The board design is terrible though IMO. Not sure why Face2Face stuck so closely to the original board design as it's not very functional. They could have easily reduced the image, increased the font size and included the colors required in each deal.

Basically a social game!  Totally random.  You travel along the board ala Monopoly by rolling a 6 sided die.  In my first game, I won by a landslide, but I also drew a bunch of Stop and I'm the Boss Cards.  The second time I played, I drew perhaps 1 Stop card and no I'm the Boss cards.  For some reason I lost.

Wicked negotiation game. Backstabbingly good. Can't backstab without also having allies. Seems to reward holding on to cards longer. Build up deals by making friends slowly then backstab late in a deal and late in the game. Act when others have low numbers of cards to ensure no counters to your plans. Don't be afraid to call a deal instead of taking cards. It's good to be the boss.

Played once w/ 5.  Has promise, but needs a few more playings to shine. Needs players who are willing to be mean.  Our game kind of played itself - each player playing what they could each deal - and we chugged along to the end, said "meh", and put it away.

Update: Traded away.  I just didn't see my usual crowd enjoying this.

Cool negation game where players try to make perfect deals with each other. Is chaotic because of the continuous interrupts by the cards played by those who are left out from the deals but this interaction makes the game fun. Not too serious but in this case is doesn't bother me at all.

RATING: 5
Played twice.  I proved to be lousy at this.  Our first play we all ran out of cards, but the second time we were more careful and took some time off to draw cards if the deal we landed on seemed bad for us.  I'm not sure what to make of this game - I'd like to try it again, because whatever strategy I was pursuing most emphatically did NOT work.

I do feel like the game suffers from some pacing problems, particularly at the beginning when everyone is stocking up on cards, and at the end when only a few deals are left.  Also, sometimes the negotiations just plain stall, and other times people try to jump in after the deal is concluded.  It's probably inescapable in a free-form game like this, but it's really not my style.

Upped from a 6 to a 7 after a couple more plays.  There's a lot more to this game than I first thought, and I really like the natural tension between trying to get SOMETHING as a secondary participant and not allowing the Boss to get too much... makes it a good study of greed, and it's lots of fun with the right group of people.  Probably wouldn't work with people who are not used to getting shafted by other people.

Negotiation game?  More like a simultaneous whack-em yelling match game.  He who yells the loudest and plays the most cards wins.  That said, it was fun to play but I couldn't play this very often and I've decided to take this off my wish/want list.  First game to ever really piss me off.  Second play was better but I'd rather play a real negotiation game.

What a great game of backstabbing, deal making and outright scallywagging.  With a crowd of people you're familiar with, or just a crowd who is willing to be cutthroat, this game gets and A+.  You've got to be quick, but yet, you've also got to stall just the right amount of time in order for a deal to go your way.  You can cut deals when you've got a full hand of cards, you can cut deals when you have none.  You just have to know how to work the negotiation and your opponents.

This is a real sweet game that can run you through a full compliment of emotions in under 5 seconds.  Great fun.

First off, this game needs at least 5. 4 and below is a no go.

Okay, so there's a huge luck of the draw factor where you lack power if you lack cards (or the right cards), but damn if this isn't a fun time. This game is purely a vehicle for tabletalk and boisterousness.

I'm generally not a fan of "take that!" mechanics, but they absolutely work in a light negotiation game like this. In this game when someone slaps down a card defiantly, forcing you to re-think what you thought was an assured victory... it's met with chorus of cheers, jeers, gasps, and laughs from the table, instead of an annoyed sigh from the Dicked and silence from the other players. And of course, there's always a chance that you could talk your way back to the top....

RATING: 7
Wild action negotiating game.  As in all games, let your taste be your guide.

The mechanic is clever, reminding me of children squabling over a piece of pie.  "You can slice it any way you like as long as you all agree on who gets which slice."  In this game, everyone gets a turn with "the knife".

To me, it could work as a 6 player party game.  It's a good game that reveals a little bit of everyone's personality and character.  People who are easily offended, or who are poor sports should avoid this game because, the level of self-promotion and self-interest required to play this may be beyond some people's comfort level.

RATING: 5.5
Sid Sackson is probably one of the fathers of modern boardgaming and the creator of classics such as Acquire, Can’t Stop and Sleuth. However, I’m generally not a big fan of his games (except for Sleuth); I think they show their age and that they aren’t too exciting to play. To me, “I’m the Boss” is just like his other games – it’s not particularly bad, but also definitely not exciting and does have some problems with luck (the card draws).

However, I must admit that my first playthrough itself was fun enough as I played with a good group that got into the game with backstabbing and such, and I like this feature in this particular game as it feels harmless because the game forces you into it. In my first play, I was the boss in the last round, but one of the others played an “I’m the Boss”-card and the other three made a deal and prevented me from getting a lot of money – which was actually quite cool! 

Obviously I would have played a “Stop” card, but I only drew a few during the game, and I actually only got a “ItB” card once during the entire game! This leads me to one of the drawbacks, the luck of the draw, which can be a problem. However, the game isn’t too long, and most of the cards are usable under different circumstances. Still, you are likely not going to win if you don’t get good cards, no matter how good a talker you are!
- because yes, you really are going to talk a lot! This is, after all, basically a negotiation game. This also means that I suspect it is going to be even better with 5 or maybe even 6 players as there will be more negotiations (but maybe the game will outstay its welcome).

The last thing I want to add is that, by design, it seems as if the game rewards you to sit back a little and not be the very first to help, because then you might lose your cards entirely due to travel cards or other cards being played against you… So the best time to act is right before the deal is made and then obstruct. Also, I liked that you can threaten the other players by saying that you want some shares or you will blow up the entire deal.

This is a terrific family game.  Reminds me of playing Masterpiece when I was a kid, except that this is a lot more fun.  And there are plenty of opportunities for tactical play -- like waiting for a player or two to spend their cards, then offering a deal that's generous to the other players so that nobody who can stop it will want to.

More hidden strategy than is immediately apparent, and it's an up-tempo good time.  Underneath, there is a fascinating tactical and strategic game, but the game plays off of people's susceptibility to temptation and to groupthink.  Very replayable because it's driven so much by -- yes, I'm going to say it -- player interaction.  Strong "let's play it again" reaction on my end.

Cutthroat negotiation game, not for the sensitive.  These types of games turn me off somewhat, due to the occasional arbitrary nature of the decison-making it requires.

RATING: 6
Received in a math trade for Power Grid.

Let's start a rating with a 7 after one play. Every negotiation game needs a "driver" or mechanic that motivates the wheeling and dealing. With I'm the Boss, that driver is not as strong as it is in other games. The driving of the deal is largely in the hands of "the boss" for the turn. A timid boss = weak trading.

But, what this game offers that some other negotiation games do not is the crazy disruption of all the cards that steal or send off "relatives," swap who's the boss, etc. That offers a unique feel to the game. 

I'm the Boss may not be my personal favorite negotiation game, but it's very easy to teach, and it's a potential gateway. Our first group was very polite, and I'd love to see how this works when people really get in the spirit of the game.

Update: eventually traded this away in a math trade. Maybe I should have given this another shot, but I've got enough negotiation games that this never really got my attention, and it just sat on the shelf. Chinatown, Bohnanza, and Genoa are all superior games, and they cover relative light gamers to serious gamers. I guess this game was just redundant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game as long as you do not take it seriously.  Lots of deal making and breaking.  Lots of chances to screw over your opponents and get screwed over in return.  To me, this game is more about the experience.  If you only play games to win I doubt this is the game for you.  My rating for this is based on a game for a cahnge of pace from the serious analytical games.

RATING: 7
Brilliant real time game of wheeling and dealing. You can't be shy when you are playing this game. I'm the Boss is a loud mouth scamp that puts a smile on almost everyone's face.

Utterly cutthroat negotiation game which remains equally well balanced and interesting when played by, err, more genteel and friendly players.  That said the game suffers on two counts: 1) Far too many players treat it as a random "Take That!" festival, and 2) Far too few players realise that the core of the game is a delicate balance of hand management and negotiation-cum-bluffing..

Negotiation games can be great fun with the right group. Here, Sid Sackson has crafted a very fun, quick-playing little game with just the right amount of deal-making and back-stabbing to really be enjoyable. If it was 2 hours long, it would wear out its welcome. But in a 45 minute or less game, I'm the Boss remains fresh and fun.

RATING: 7
For a 60 minute game, I'm The Boss packs in quite a lot of haggling, negotiation, and plain old villainy.  Making the deals seems sort of flighty and arbitrary at first but when it comes together, it's very satisfying.  Judicious use of "take that" style cards gives them game a spark missing from some negotiation games.  The play length is perfect, but the variable ending is kind of a let-down.

A negotiation game that is wildly chaotic and simply not that much fun. The "take that" card system feels decidedly at odds with the design's dealmaking core, and makes it difficult to bring any leverage into a discussion. Combined with the random end determination, the game devolves into the distinctly unpleasant experience of backing into any and all deals possible, if you're allowed, and usually for scraps.

RATING: 6
Components: The Face2Face edition suffers from numerous flaws that impair gameplay.

1. The investor, clan, and travel cards are all too similar looking. At a minimum the clan cards could have a photo of the named relative, rather than of the investor. But ideally there would be a different border for both the clan and travel cards to distinguish them from the investor cards, and from each other. The investor cards could even be larger and on thicker cardstock, since they rarely change hands and don't need to be thoroughly shuffled.

2. The purple and lavender investors (G and D) are too similarly colored.

3. The photos on the various spaces of the board occupy too much of the real estate, and the important information (especially the names of the qualifying investors) is too difficult to read from across the table, especially in the gray boxes. These elements should be much larger.

4. The 'swipe' cards should have a background other than yellow (which is too similar to one of the investors).

5. We need more $2M bills, and fewer $10M bills.

6. The rules are poorly arranged, with critical pieces of information lost among paragraphs of text. Sidebars would be helpful.

Experience: Great fun. With six players, the chances to obtain cards are few, so the value of these cards is high. Early in the game when shares are cheap it makes sense to draw cards. But the value of cards also depends on how many are in circulation. Gaining a second investor at a key moment when noone is capable of stealing them back can be of enormous benefit, as everyone wants to be the boss when big deals go down (and therefore fewer cards enter circulation). At the beginning of the game we undersell each other to the point where participants are typically only earning $1M per deal; later in the game, when competition isn't as stiff and more is at stake, the true price gouging begins.

Combine a 'take that' card game with a basic negotiation framework, and you get KKK.  This was perhaps my first 'white elephant' let down.  After hearing all those people who thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, I found a copy after much searching, only to be disappointed upon playing.  Don't get me wrong, it's a decent game.  But it's not the end-all, be-all of games like some would have you believe.  Plus, like most barebones negotation games, the group playing makes ALL the difference in the world.

Light, quick, deal-making with lots of reversals of fortune giving rise to improvised solutions.

This game is a fast-paced negotiating game.  There are all kind of cards to change the parameters of the deal. So just when the deal is just about to get done, something is thrown in to make the process begin again.  Fun, but not for the faint of heart.  Best strategy is to let everyone exhaust their cards, then step in and use your cards to maximum benefit.  Negotiation-turtling strategy!

RATING: 3
Overrated negotitation game. Players on their turn try to close "deals" by bring the required investors into the deal and earn the cash pot.  The investors are controlled by the players, but a deck of cards allows anyone to interfere with the current deal, totally breaking down any form of structure the game pretends to have.  The result is a chaotic mess. There are much better negotiation games out there - Chinatown for starters.

A good pure negotiation game with the right group. A party atmosphere, some uninhibited players, and perhaps some alcohol could take this one a long way. I wouldn't play it with less than 5, and 6 would be best. If you play with less, I feel that more cards should be distributed to encourage more interaction.

RATING: 10
I've had some of my best group gaming experiences ever with this game.  An added layer of complexity is that you need to do well without appearing to do too well.  The shrewdest deal maker often finds themselves boxed out by the end of the game! I like to play so that the ONLY thing that can be bargained for is investor use.  Other cards must be played so as to maximize the value of your investors.  Also, subcontracts made for each investor are binding and cannot be altered unless the boss is changed or an investor is sent away.  This keeps the game moving along and the negotiations fierce.   

Update May 2011
So I have tried Intrigue, Mall of Horror, Lifeboats, and Chinatown and still find this to be my favorite pure negotiation game.  I love the way your cards give you hidden leverage in the negotiations, a factor missing in these other games.

Update December 2014
As the years pass, my appreciation for Sackson's games only increases.  His designs are pure, focused, and bring the spark that makes them FUN.  My kids are now 7 and 9, and we just played it with them for the first time.  They played very well, the game was close, and we had an awesome time together.  Thank you Mr. Sackson!
  
Rating raised to a 10.  I'm finding so many former favorites diminished in my eyes when I pull them down lately, but this one holds up and is unmatched in the genre.

RATING: 6
A combination of pure negotiation and "Take That!" card play.   Therein lies both its brilliance and it's fatal flaw.   Things are already so wide open that the card play detracts from the experience.   Perhaps if the ratio of cards was scaled a little bit differently.    The game is clever in that it forces certain players to be involved in the deals, which tends to break down any long-standing alliances and make everything about wheeling and dealing "in the moment".   I would play again, but I'm pretty sure I don't love it (or this type of game).

This game can be very fun if you're able to make deals, but your ability to do that seems to hinge more on the cards in your hand rather than your negotiating skills. Therefore, the game kinda reduces down to the luck of the draw which can be very frustrating.

Great interactive, boisterous, and loud game.  The back and forth card play can get ridiculously fun sometimes.  Has a few repetitive boring periods where players are just restocking their hands with cards.  Fun game for six, where everyone is always involved (unless your hand of cards is greatly reduced).  Card timing issues can be a little annoying at times.  Whether strategy has any real role in this game, it is hard to say, but it doesn’t really matter for this type of game—it’s too loud to allow much thinking anyway.

RATING: 7.5
Played once with 4, 5, and 6 respectively. Of those, best with 6, by far. Each player lost takes away quite a bit. I suspect that it'd be similar with 3, even though all of the permanent investors are out to start with. So, with 6, I give it an 8, maybe higher. With 4, it gets a 5. With 5, probably a 6.5. It really does make that much difference.

Losing its luster with a few more plays. It really needs people who get it to play well, and I'm not yet sure how to convey what "it" is, yet.

brilliant cut-throat negotiation game -- lots of screwage and savage inter-play, this game is not for the faint-hearted -- it is everyone for themselves, there are no friends nor co-operation in this game -- chaos, free-for-all , and definitely not for the shy -- this game will make anyone come out of their shell -- not the way to break in a first timer at the table -- tons and tons of fun with the right group -- this game encourages one to step on toes; elbow others out of the way; takeover deals; and cure shyness -- a brilliant winner of chaos -- one of my favourites

This is probably my favorite pure negotiation game. I'm the Boss shines with six players and plays well with five, although I don't think I would suggest any fewer than that. How well you do in this game depends on one thing: how much money you can bluff, threaten, negotiate, bargain, or wheedle out of the other players. You have to know when to aggressively push yourself into a deal, and when to save your strength for a better position. You have to mentally keep track of how much the other players have earned while keeping yourself in the running, but you can't take too much in one go or no one will be willing to negotiate with you on the next turn. And if you can pull off a large deal by yourself, it's supremely satisfying. 

I'm the Boss isn't for quiet people. You have to keep the pressure on everyone without overextending your own position. Hang on to your investor, grab a small piece of a deal if you can (and a large piece if you're able), and backstab carefully. It's raucous fun!

The only potential downside is that groupthink can take over a game. If there are six players and five of them decide not to negotiate with the sixth, it's really hard to stay in contention. 

Strategy tip: I've found that people remember large payouts of a single deal far more easily than smaller payouts spread over many deals. Don't grab $15 million for yourself early on; you might not be able to recover. But if you can be involved in every deal made, even if it's only for a couple of million, you stand a good chance of winning at the end.

Also, undercutting is good. But remember that every time you go lower, you're giving more of a share to someone else. Sometimes it's better to take a stand than let someone walk away with a big chunk of the pot, especially as the game nears completion.

RATING: 8
Classic negotiation game, appeals also to non-gamers.

Negotiation games don't get much better than I'm the Boss! If you have five or six players who can handle some free-for-all negotiation without getting hurt feelings and who aren't afraid to raise their voices and get into spirit of some wild wheeling and dealing, this classic from Sid Sackson will create a rollicking and fun experience like few other games can provide.

Full review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/820694

Rule tips:
- Many people play with a house-rule that prohibits threats/extortion, also for a more speedy game, see [thread=126187]this thread[/thread] for discussion (also [thread=19040]this thread[/thread]).
- always give players an opportunity to respond with cards, including when concluding a deal (count it out slowly)
- the current player need not have an investor or clan member to get money from brokering a deal
- you can only negotiate to get money from the current deal, not directly from another player
- you may only negotiate after the current player says "Let's make a deal", and may not try to entice or influence him before hand
- no influence cards may be played before the current player says "Let's make a deal"
- if you are negotiating based on a clan card in your hand, you must place it face up on the table until the deal is done

Variants to consider:
- can only negotiate if you have an investor/clan member; no threats/extortion
- turn order after playing "I'm the Boss" card still reverse to original next player

RATING: 3
While this started off engaging and exciting, I ended up very disappointed with the experience and would be hard-pressed to try this one again. This is the type of game that I say "collapses under its own weight" in that what makes it fun ends up making it burdensome. We'd often negotiate for several minutes but then when the deal was finalized, someone would say, "Oh, I don't like the sounds of that, let's [quash it/take it over/send someone on a plane and introduce a new character, etc]". At first this was crazy-fun amusing(!) but it got tiring for me quickly. Perhaps there should be a "speak now or hold your peace" around the table in order. After constantly having deals worked out, quashed, restarted, quashed, etc. I grew tired of the whole experience.  

The cherry on that parfait was when one player was able to consummate two deals entirely by himself and make an absurd amount of money (15 and 16M). We all felt the game was effectively over and called it there two hours into the game. I'd need some kind of modification to the negotiation process if I were to try this again.

RATING: 6
A can-be-raucous negotiating game that can be co-operative to totally cut-throat.  I like it that everyone starts equally with no advantage with who goes first or last; I like it that when a negotiation begins, there are no turns--everyone participates in the deal whenever they wish, to break, promote, and/or comprise the deal; I like it that the deals are kept relatively simple--you are allowed to negotiate with cash only--I think this makes it more of a gateway game since it doesn't get too complicated.  The problem is, I just don't like games of negotiation all that much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An hour of laughter and non-stop mayhem.  Players negotiate amongst themselves who will be part of the deals that are made.  The positions keep changing as the cards shift the investors from one player to the others.  Hand management is key so as to avoid a late game solo deal which will most likely be a clincher.  Lots of fun!

I dig this game, it's good chaotic fun.  Perhaps with more plays it might rise...I wouldn't just drop-dead play this game all the time, but I would like to play it on a semi-regular basis.  The free-form wheeling and dealing may just put some people off, especially as the game veers into "party game" noise levels.  If you're not good at negotiation or if your people skills suck, you're going to get hammered by this.  It kind of makes me wonder why the game is rated over 7 on BGG when the typical user here hates loud games with lots of player interaction.  Maybe it's a "well, this is a *designer* game" thing.  Anyway...look forward to playing it again.

This is Sackson's classic negotiation game. It's a little more fumbly than Quo Vadis (which I think is one of the purest negotiation games) but it still is interesting to make negotiations while still trying to come out on top while avoiding making another player too rich.  The math part and splitting dividends after negotiations can slow down the game, but not too bad.  The card play free-for-all feels a bit dated but actually works fine in this game. Overall, not my favourite negotiation game but one that deserves a place on the shelf of any negotiation game fan.

An absolute riot with 5-6 players and booze (score based on this setup as it's our usual gaming situation)Possibly the most fun we've had gaming for a while. A streamlined game focussed purely on negotiation and interruption. Its quick to play, which is both a positive and a negative. 
Has taken over Bohnanza as our game-of-choice.
Not recommended for those who take themselves too seriously. Only worth a 7/10 for less than 5 players

Insane & constantly changing negotiation game, but you really need the right group for this, who are sometimes difficult to find. It can be a little bit too much with all the changes with the cards taking place and all of the 'interruption' of play. Rather play Chinatown.

This game is a blast.  Especially when played with people who love to wheel and deal.  The game is just light enough to feel like it's almost all browbeating/dealing/undercutting with a game facilitating but not dominating.  Definitely best if played fairly fast.

The first round of our first game didn't bode well, as it dragged, with players whining that they needed time to evaluate their cards..  After that, though, it was a quick, exciting game.  Just don't take it too seriously.

RATING: 6
I never expected to like this game, since haggling games and "Take That!" games often fall flat for me - and Kohle, Kies & Knete has both of those in spades.  But with the right group of players, this is an entertaining game.  We treat it as chaotic, freewheeling fun rather than as an intense, hardcore negotiation game.  Be warned that the game really only works if players are unwilling or unable to track everyone's score.  When you know who is ahead and by how much, the game completely falls apart.  That's not a problem in our group, but it needs to be mentioned.

I love holding out on an "im the boss" card for 15 minutes while players build up deals, throw down cards, screw each other over and then when everyone's hands are depleted and its like the 15th attempt at the same deal ...and they are all worn and weary from the backstabbing ...and they think the deal is finally going to go through ....and then at the very last second of "going going gone" part, I say ..."whoa whoa whoa fellas ....as it turns out ....IM THE BOSS" and throw my card in and start the dealmaking all over again. You can't buy fun like that ....well I guess you can ...its about 22 dollars!!!!

The game's all about negotiation and a few player-initiated random turns of events.  You'll like this game about as much as you'd expect to like a game of non-stop negotiation.  I'm still not sure about it; on one hand, the luck involved in the cards you draw adds fun variability to the game... on the other hand, powerful cards seem pretty unbalancing, and it can take a while to recover from something bad happening to you.

Players assume the role of wealthy investors bent on closing lucrative deals.  To do this, however, they will usually need partners -- which requires splitting the profits.  Determining the details of the split is the difficult part, and generally results in heated negotiations and attempts by other players to muscle-in on the deal.  The caption on the box provides an accurate description of the game:  "An Exciting Game of Deal Making, Negotiation and Cutthroat Bargaining!"

I’m the Boss is not for the faint-of-heart or easily offended.  Deals are offered and withdrawn at a rapid pace.  At one point a player may be part of an investment team, only to be cut-out when another player makes a better offer, or sends his investor on an unanticipated vacation.  At one moment you can be an ally with the Boss, but at the next moment being tossed aside and ignored.  Folks with thin-skins would be best advised to avoid this game.  All others, however, will likely rejoice at the exhilarating pace, and thrill to the excitement of attempting to forge a deal.  If you enjoy cutthroat negotiation, bargaining and deal making, then you will find no better game to get your adrenaline flowing.  Sid Sackson has truly endowed us with a masterpiece.

I agree with the assessment that its more of an activity than a game.  We had a lot of fun, and the free-wheeling negotiation is truly a blast, but a few little niggling flaws cause some problems that prevent it from reaching its full potential.

First, you do need like 6 people.  Might work with 5 but the 3-6 thing is a bit of a joke.  Next, it can be very frustrating when you work out a deal over the course of ten minutes THEN someone throws down a card.  I'm thinking next time we play we will hand out the money for the deal early, so the boss can arrange it to keep track of the splits in case someone drops a card.  Its frustrating if you are playing this half drunk (the best way) and people throw down a few cards and suddenly the boss can't remember his deal. 

This is a classic and a great pure negotiation game but not something I'd want to play every week!

I'm the Boss! is extremely fun, despite some of the complaints I have about it. In the end, it is fantastic and almost assuredly will put a smile on your face (at least while you have a few investors in front of you).

We play with the variant where players without investors draw 4 and others draw less depending on how many investors they have. Having played a bit more now, I also think that "Boss" cards shouldn't affect turn order, so we play with that variant too. This is mainly because you can have a tremendous amount of down time if you lose your investor, which is exacerbated if your turn is skipped too.

Some of the more advanced deals can get a little bit mathy if several players are involved. I don't think this is too much of an issue except when it includes players acting as boss who are shy or not decent negotiators (which despite it being the name of the game, I find it unfortunate how some players will let deals be dictated to them!). I'm the Boss gives enough even with weak negotiators for everyone to have fun though, especially with the cards. In the edition I have, I wish there were iconography or colors on the board for the optional investors.  

Everyone I've introduced this game to has wanted to play again and again.


Update: Although I still think I'm the Boss is really fun, in my opinion it requires a house rule with 5 and especially 6 players to make it work for everyone involved. Basically, I think players with no primary investors should draw a card or two every round they don't have a primary investor. We haven't tried this particular rule yet, but have found that even drawing more cards on your turn when you don't have an investor at high player counts isn't enough, since you may not have enough turns to rebuild (you are done in a six player game if you lose your investor and don't have an immediate triple). I lowered my score to 7.

Extra update: Typically we play with the typical rule of draw 3, but that you may not steal from someone who only has one investor. At 6 players, I'd play that no player may begin the next turn with no primary investors if they are stolen from. Frankly, I'd house rule a little differently, but my group  is into this, so I'll take it. Almost everyone I know who has played it has loved it, even non-gamers. I've seen some editions I like better than mine, which make it more clear who is able to negotiate. Anyway, I will keep I'm the Boss! forever because it is truly a game that can be loved by gamers and non-gamers equally, and it doesn't require a steep learning curve for the two groups to be on equal footing.


However, I want to stress that I wholeheartedly recommend this game for any group; it is amazingly fun and short enough to play multiple times. 4 players is probably the best player count.

A hard-nuts negotiation game.  It's like... [i]Traders of Genoa[/i] & [i]Acquire[/i]'s crack-baby all grown up and having an ADD-fueled bipolar blowout in the boardroom.  You will hear naughty words.  Coming out of your own mouth.

UPDATE:  This is now referred to as the "I'm Not Your Friend Anymore Game".

UP-UPDATE:  Someone mean requested this at the last gamesday as a joke—knowing full well how much we all feared its power to upset and rile.  Turns out that if you come into it resolved not to take anything personally the game really shines.  It ends up being the "thinking man's [gameid=140]".  I'm glad to see the game redeemed and back in the rotation.

I didn't like this game. This doesn't mean the game is by any means bad, it means I don't like the gameplay which is, especially in the negotiations, very chaotic.

I regard this as a family game, not a gamer's game.  Only just, though!  It is very good fun, but quite random because of the modifier cards.  You could play without these cards, but actually it is the cards that give it a lot of fun too!  Plenty of social interaction in the form of making "deals", and always the chance that your mother-in-law will beat you.  But, hey, if you have a problem with that then you're missing the point of this type of game!

Now that I understand this, I believe it is one of the easier games to introduce to new players. The rules are pretty simple, and it's easy to remember what you can do every turn.

Really, the entire game hinges on getting into as many deals as possible, and screwing the people you think are getting into more. It is a little confusing to know when a deal is official, so we've started shaking hands to remove all doubt.

1st played 10/17/07. Taught in ~10min, played in ~1hr w/ 5 players. This negotiation game is about making the best deals to end up with the most $ at game's end. When later deals (max 16) are completed, you roll a die to see if the game ends. Gameboard has 16 deals which require a certain specific # of investors & rewards a certain amount of shares (deal is worth shares * $ from deal draw pile). The player who lands on the space decide if he wants to "boss" the deal or draw 3 cards (max of 15). As the boss, you decide which players (if any) you will use. Each player convinces the boss to use their investors (for $) to get a piece of the pie. If you have all of the investors in your hand, then you can do the deal yourself. Deck consists cards of: investors (6 types), travel (takes investors out of competition [most specific investor, some anyone]), boss (changes boss to card-player), recruitment (steal an investor from someone; requires 3 of this cards) & stop (cancels any action). If the deal is not made (no willing participants or none available), then simply no money is collected and then it's the next player turn. When a deal is made, that space is skipped. I'd recommend giving it a gameplay, however I wouldn't recommend purchase.

I think you need 5 or 6 players for a good game but I have played with 3 and it was OK.  With 6 it took a few turns for everybody to burn their cards (that stopped or hindered a deal) so that deals could finally be made.

RATING: 7
Finally, a negotiation game done right...I'm The Boss! is stripped down to the core of the haggling mechanic but leaves enough behind to prevent abuse of the system.  Other players can't easliy lock you out of deals, so that whole "getting kicked out of the running by other players just because they want to" fiddliness is gone (the biggest problem with negotiation games in my opinion).  The deals are also different enough to the point that everyone will get some action no matter how certain people want the game to go.  I like the cards as well, since none seem particularly non-useful.  All in all, this is how negotiation games should be designed.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2014)

Fun negotiation game. Very easy to teach and it plays very quickly making it perfect for the family and non-gamers. I had fun playing the game, but the negotiation window is very narrow, so you can’t negotiate very much, that is for me I´m the boss isn’t almost a negotiation game. It also has lots of chaos and uncontrollable luck in the way of cards, however as the game is so frantic and fast, this is a plus here. Also lots of luck in the game endings, but I also enjoyed it there. Had the game playtime be longer I would hate it. 

Best with 6 players. Not much of a strategy here, most friends always attack the perceived leader and won’t negotiate with him.

It has lots of “take that” and "attack the leader“ moments, I don’t enjoy those as I used to but it is still fun in this game. I’m not sure about the replayability factor of the game. 

Bottom line, I loud, silly game that I would play from time to time. As I said before I don’t feel this isn’t a negotiation game so I would play many others before this one in that regard, however the fun factor is present in I´m the Boss. There is a remote possibility I will buy the game.

with the right group an unmitigated success...with the wrong group (shy, introverted, um...shouldn't be gaming type) a complete waste.

This game is heavily group dependent, but it's a classic you should give a go to at least more than once in your life. 

Sackson was the inventor of the Euro feel in my mind. He was onto something.

Played once, I think we got the rules wrong, we didn't know what it meant to "take over the deal" i.e. take over the deal as-is, or do all the cards go back into peoples' hands and it starts all over, or what?  Need to get this game and really read/learn the rules.  Negotiation games are a lot of fun.

2 plays and I really don't like the amount of chaos that occurs through the card play. The player initiating a deal really has no idea whether or not he will be involved in the deal at all. So it seems that the active player is really just triggering card play and once the dust settles those players with the necessary families can negotiate.

A fun negotiation game, though not as frenetic or loud as I anticipated.  The card distribution can make a big difference, but as long as the game moves quickly, it doesn't bother me.  Even the take that cards don't really matter all that much.  I'm not sure how much skill there is to the negotiations, it seems like it's best to hold back as long as you can as the share prices increase.

RATING: 6
Pure negotiating and trick game. If you like screwing your friends, this is the right game. Easy to grasp, but have to be [b]tricky and aggressive[/b]. Pick your battles! Fun with the right people.

Can get very frustrating if you aren't in the running and don't have any cards. After a few plays, seems to rely on [b]mostly luck [/b](getting I'm the boss and the sacred STOP cards) [b]and probability [/b](holding the most cards).

Not good enough incentive to start a negotiation. 9.9/10 times it's a better idea to draw 3 cards instead of opening the deal. Because of this, the game feels dry.

A player who starts the action normally ends up being the loser. That itself is a [b]very backwards mechanic[/b]. Still, it's a game that's simple enough so everyone can play tricks and get into the spirit of the game.

RATING: 4
I've played my fair share of negotiation games. Depending on the group you play with, some can be quite good and others quite bad. This game has a flaw that makes it fail with most groups -- too many options. When holding 12 cards, players can keep arguing for a long time because every time someone makes a deal, someone else can threaten with cards, which in turn causes someone else to start threatening... and it never ends. Until one player gets too tired of the whole shebang and just gives in (not because they want to, but because they are tired).

Its a very unsatisfying feeling, having to give up on a negotiation because it just never seems to end, and you just want the game to move forward. The freeform idea was good, but the execution was terrible.

A great party game with lots of bluffing, backstabbing and unexpected turns. Lots of laughters! Thoroughly entertaining. You are trying to complete a deal you open up and to do this you need alliances. Who do you take in and how much money you give to them? But you can never be sure no one will steal the deal in front of your nose.
Cards give you power, but you also want to make as many many deals as possible.
Nothing deep, but still lots of fun.

After hearing the rules the game felt somewhat random. While playing I found out that this is actually quite a tight set of mechanisms with a nice theme included. The playing is fun when the balance of dealing is constantly turning around through cardplay. Negotiating could also be fun here, because you're usually negotiating with more than 1 player and your negotiation partners could suddenly completely change. I also liked the cardset, because it's almost impossible to draw useless cards like you do in most games that have some cards in them. Only if you happen to not draw a 3rd recruit card you're unlucky. The components are also quite nice, so this is quite likeable.

The negotiations in this game are fun but it is not terribly strategic and there will be a lot of attacking of the leader which means that anyone who shows themselves to be too skilled a negotiator on the cheap early deals will likely be shut out of the late valuable ones. I don't like this sort of perverse incentive. This does however work as a party game with just enough strategy to keep me wanting to play occasionally.

Everyone I have played with loves this game.  My wife liked it and she doesn't like many of my games. The right or wrong group can enhance or detract from the experience.

Update: This can be enjoyable but it's more a party game than a gamer's game. You really just have to enjoy the experience rather than trying to win or it will frustrate you.  The dominant personality will run away with, as is the case with a lot of negotiation games.  People are so interested in getting in on a deal they will take just about any offer, at any price.  Traded away because I didn't want to have to play it if it was requested...

(BASED ON A 6 PLAYER GAME)Not bad at all, as long as you have the following: (a.) 6 players (b.) several hours (negotiation time is extremely variable) (c.) friends who realize "it's just a game"The strategy is mostly psychological, convincing people to cut you into deals or short change other players.  Is reverse psychology good enough, or do you have to threaten?  Can you guilt trip someone for sacrifices you made to keep the deal in play?Deals will change quickly as negotiations fall through with the play of a card or a needed investor backing out.  The cards are extremely powerful, so don't waste them on small deals...resist the urge...save it for the big deals, and become the boss to score big; otherwise you'll end up with a small hand with few options when they count.Grab some beer and some friends for late night chaotic fun.

RATING: N/A
Classic negotiation game in which players take turns being "The Boss" arranging deals between specific players on how best to divide piles of money. Players can sabotage or kill deals they're not happy with.

Rarely is a game stripped down to its bare essense as cleanly as I'm the Boss! is. Up to fifteen deals can be made over the course of the game, and a player who is part of a successful deal will receive a certain amount of money.

How much money? Well, that depends on whatever deal is made among the players involved, as negotiated by that round's boss. Complicating matters quite a bit, however, each player has a hand of action cards that can be used to derail negotiations, insert themselves into a deal, take over the role of boss, and otherwise muck with the smooth flow of deal-making that other players had hoped to achieve. Nertz to them! If you want to make a deal, you gotta cut me a share!

It's a fast simple negociation game. The only thing I don't like is that you always lack of cards. Maybe if you could basically at least draw 1 card each turn and then if you skip your turn you draw 2 or 3 cards, it would be much better.

RATING: 8
It's a blast with six and a favorite in the 6-player party game category.  Very good with 5 players but I probably would play something else with 4 or less.  I think I prefer it with player's turns not switching after a deal is done so you would need to keep track of the active/start player (before a deal is open and closed).  In other words, player turn order would continue clockwise, unless if you were just the Boss, your turn skips to the next player on your left.

This can be a very fun game with the right crowd.  The first time I played we didn't have a hand limit and people could only conclude all deals after waiting for everyone to play their cards.  It became an exercise in hoarding cards, hand management and patience (there was no incentive to play any cards before the last possible minute).  Using the correct rules, this game becomes a fun, chaotic negotiation game.

As is, I consider the game broken and unplayable.  The Permanent Investors make it so that it's always in your interest to offer to accept the LOWEST amount possible as long as you are included in a deal, because you don't lose anything and at least you're getting some money instead of none.  I think if you took away the Permanent Investors and reworked some other ideas you could have a nice game.

Played a friend's copy a few times and really had a good time playing. Negotiation games are not normally my thing but the chaos factor of the free for all and the ability to sit out and jump in to spoil the deal even if you don't think you'll make anything on it is pure genius.

You've got to be in the right mood for this one. Getting repeatedly chopped out of deals and being short on cards can make for a very long game indeed.

Great negotiation game IF you have the right mix of people.  Can be very, very confusing to teach during first few turns and through first couple of negotiations. For a game w/such simple rules, it can really be complicated to figure out how to make proper deals.  Only highly rated if playing w/a group that likes to smack-talk.

I'm the Boss! is an economic, deal making game for 3-6 players.  In it, players represent wealthy investor clans who are required to take part in the deals to get them done.  This happens through negotiation, and card play.

The person whose turn it is, is the current boss.  They have the option of trying to get the current deal done, if it hasn't already happened, roll the die to move the marker around the board to get to the next deal, or take three cards.

If they take option one, or two then they attempt to get the clans indicated on the space to come together in agreement.  What they are trying to come to terms on is how to divide the money that the deal will bring them.  If they take the cards, then their turn ends and passes to the next player.

What complicates the deal making process is card play.  Some cards allow players to represent the same clans as other players.  This means two or more people can compete for their place in the deal.  Some cards allow players to outright take clan representation away from others.  Some cards boot players out of a deal.  The "I'm the Boss" card wrests control of the deal from the current boss, and gives it to the one who just played it.  Finally, "stop" cards countermand any of the aforementioned cards from taking effect.  Any player can play any of these cards at any time while the deal is being negotiated.

The result of all this negotiation coupled with card play is pure chaos!  And this is what will determine whether you'll like the game or not.  If you like to plan your strategy,  execute it, and watch it come to fruition, then you won't like "I'm the Boss".  If you like random things happening that you have very little, if any control over.  If you get a kick out of the unexpected, then you'll probably enjoy this game quite a bit.

I like this game!  I laughed throughout as the wackiness unfolded around me.  Unfortunately, for some that same wackiness was tedious, and annoying.

Extremely fun and enjoyable game! Had an awesome session. No downtime as everyone can be involved at any point of the game. One of the best purchase in recent time.

RATING: 5
A highly group dependent game. If played light-heartedly and kept moving can be fun. But there is a huge amount of chaos and take that in the game. Part of the problem is that there is very little structure to the deal making. Potentially everybody could be involved in the deal, and what everybody brings to the table is essentially equivalent to everybody else. This makes it hard to evaluate competing offers and contributes mightily to the chaos.

This game is business at its finest: negotiation, bribery, extortion, and sabotage. My wife and I have played this several times and had varying success. One couple we played with took things a bit personal when deals were being struck or destroyed and the game was called on account of "marital strain". We dared to play this with another couple and we really enjoyed the game and nobody walked away with hurt feelings. Really not a friendly game, but it IS a fun game if everybody can acknowledge that it is NOT going to make you feel "warm and fuzzy" inside.

This game made me feel inept and ignored.  I couldn't get a word in edgewise and when a player was FORCED to work with me, I ended up either having to take a crappy cut or backing out of the deal entirely.  In a six-player game where the other five players had in the neighborhood of 50 and 60 mill, I had a measly 6 million.  I don't mind losing if I had fun in the process...as I felt like a idiot child who was underfoot on Take Your Daughter to Work Day, I'll just rate it an "Ick."

The boardgaming world really needs more fast-paced, fun, six-player games like I'm the Boss.  We played this several times during the holidays and gamers and non-gamers were equally involved.  I've read some reviews that I'm the Boss is just too choatic.  Well, the chaotic negotiations is what makes this game fun to play.   Any attempt to take the game more seriously would destroy the spirit of the game.   After a couple of playings, we decided that the Boss must say "Going once, going twice, the deal is done" to give other players a last chance to play cards before the Boss closes negotiations.

This is likely a low rating, for I do so love negotiation games, but I had just played Knizia's Quo Vadis for the first time before playing *this* for the first time, and ItB was a bit chatic in comparison. There feels like there should be an ounce more control, but I think we all started to see at the end of the second game how deals could be finessed a bit better.  More plays will tell.

I think this negotiation game tends to be much more card-driven than I wished. If you have good card you can just take all the other players off the negotiation and make the best deal. It's still a funny game.

主題:1
標題"我是大老闆"，但遊戲內容我覺得玩家比較像是肩客，遊走各大公司間，負責金錢利益的分配與拉攏各公司的高級主管，玩起來很有台灣政商勾結的味道
，若遊戲能加入台灣政商勾結的惡搞事件，或者是把遊戲中的各公司換成台灣企業，相信對台灣玩家會更有吸引力及投入感!

美術:0.3
圖板很大，實在不需要那麼大，卡片美術普通，但最令我詬病的是每家公司的大老闆，股東全部長一樣的臉，真是偷懶的美工，起碼每一家公司的不同股東及老闆最好是有自已專屬的臉部特色。而且事件卡的美術也不漂亮，只能以陽春形容，美術評價不高!

規則:0.5
基本上就是嘴砲遊戲，遊戲規則不容易真正界定出明顯的對或錯，總會讓人覺得這樣玩是不是也可以的感覺，總之就是說明書寫的不是很清楚、明白。農家樂我都還只看說明說就學會如何玩!這一款我看完說明說帶大家玩一遍，還是有不了解的地方!不過因為是嘴砲遊戲所以就不需要太苛責了!

設置:1
圖板設置沒有太大的困擾，配件不多，好擺設。

路線:0.5
雖然是嘴砲遊戲，玩起來很吃人緣，不過還是可以歸納一些簡單的遊戲策略，像是"削價競爭"、"破局威脅"、""遠期支票、"策略聯盟"、只是玩這遊戲的心態很重要，到底是要玩策略，著重利益交換與談判技巧、在乎輸贏，還是玩嘴砲、歡樂，只是看朋友出糗。這樣玩起來的遊戲體驗就真的不一樣了!

互動:1
互動就是本遊戲的精華，本遊戲就是互動再互動，假如你只想悶著頭玩遊戲，那還是不要玩這款遊戲!推薦給愛嘴砲談判的人!

個人:0.8
其實這款我很想以模擬真正商場上的爾虞我詐的策略來玩看看，看看大家在真正的金錢交易遊戲下會露出甚麼人性的險惡(大概有三個方法1.玩錢2.在乎遊戲輸贏3.找相同口味的咖)，不過遇到的桌咖，只能以歡樂取向的派對遊戲來玩，有點可惜了!

朋友:0.6
玩過都覺得有趣，不過有些不愛嘴砲的人，或許還無法抓住遊戲的重點!

想玩:0.7
本遊戲的機制真的只有談判再談判，要找到對的咖一起來，不容易，找到人時還有許多好遊戲等著玩，這款只好再往後排隊，但本人內心還是想要玩看看。

收藏:0.4
有閒錢，可以買一套玩玩看，不然還是去桌遊店玩就好了!不過要是你想要訓練小朋友的談派技巧，或許這是一款不錯的教具!

總分:6.8
講評:算是羅馬共和的歡樂版，不過對於喜歡玩歡樂一點的玩家，還是玩我是大老闆就好了!尤其當打出"我是大老闆"那張卡時，大聲喊出來，還是很有爽快的感覺。

RATING: 5
A "negotiation" game with chaotic factors determining who can propose deals and thus earn money. I'm not too fond of it, since the negotiations were very chaotic, with bosses changing, trading partners changing. As a game of perception on who's winning, it can be unfair on who thinks who is winning. We played it 3 times, and it has not been played for a couple of years. It's hard to play as a strategy game, perhaps you build up your hand and try to win the big deals. As an observer game, it's kind of fun to see the cards played fast and furious. I think a couple of people in our gaming group really enjoyed it, but I wasn't too thrilled.

RATING: 6
I'm The Boss! suffers from a terrible instruction manual. It is lacking in pictures that would show game-play so much better than the explanations given. Deal-making is so unstructured that first-time players will wind up consulting the manual constantly to find out what isn't allowed, come up with nothing, shrug, say "I guess", and carry on. This makes early deals seem too simple as players inventiveness will take awhile to get fired up.

Strategies are not apparent from the get-go and the game would likely benefit from an experienced player teaching a group of novices, just so he/she can troll early deals to get the others into the spirit.

Its important to note that ItB! is a mean-spirited game at heart. The Action cards are all designed to cut other players out of profiting from the deals in one way or another. This may be a turn-off for many people.

RATING: 3.5
So much to dislike -- the roll & move mechanic; that odd thing where you are choosing which dynastic heirs to bring onto deals, yet each heir corresponds to an opponent; the whole sideshow with the cards -- because all games could use some more Fluxx... Given that it was made in the early 90's, it seems like it could have influenced the development of later, better games -- Modern Art, Sherwood Forest, Chinatown. It's a top 600 game, so I wonder if the high ratings are old ratings, or reflect Sackson loyalism.

Rowdy negotiation game, with luck of the draw, and high screwage factor. Needs the right crowd to play. Enjoyable once in a while if played fast. the player who can withold his best cards the longest or the one who keeps drawing good cards tends to win.

This game is hilarious with the right group of people.  You need people that like to make deals, and aren't afraid to ruin a deal for reasons of spite.  This was a HUGE hit when played with non-gamers.  Just be ready for a bit of yelling, accusations and finger-pointing. 

Final note:  There is a bit of a game-y exploit to be found.  If you sucker others into pouring resources into the first deal(s) you can collude with one other player to drive deals through unopposed before the others can reload their "dirt" cards.  Players should be aware of this tactic and not overcommit too often.

RATING: 10
Sid Sackson's last masterpiece is a chaotic, rambunctious backstabbing orgy where players MUST close a certain amount of deals and earn the most out of them. The mechanics are (again) as polished as they can be: the fact that the die only influences the deal to attempt, and the multiple possibilities to get on the other players' nerves mean that luck isn't a serious influence on the game (unless the nastiest player gets all the "I'm the Boss" cards at once). 

Both its limited length of about an hour (for players not too sneaky, that is) and its intensity with everyone shouting and throwing cards simultaneously make I'm the Boss pretty much the apex of negotiation games. Such a game can't work with every crowd, but oh when it does...

Simple rules. Amazing gameplay! Everyone gets emotional in this negotiation game. But unlike Risk, the game never gets out of hand. Skills needed for this game are unusual in the board game world. I love that the game only takes about 45 minutes to play. My 2nd favorite Sid Sackson game after my all-time favorite, Acquire (the only 2 Sid Sackson games I've tried...so far :P  ).

Extremely chaotic bartering game, where you do your best to get a piece of the deals.  I enjoy this one a lot, but we've had bouts of frustration because one person felt there was too much chaos.  We put in a couple rules for structure (including a count to 3 last chance to play cards to wreck a deal), and that cleaned it up a bit.

Embarrased to say that the strategy required to win this game is beyond my abilities. My rating of the game reflects my desire to play again (which is slight) rather than the actual design or mechanics or game play. Just too many negotiation strategies for easy play, and agonizing decision on when to open a deal. A minor semantics complaint: The text (on the board itself) that listed the combinations of investors was hard to read from a distance. This game is just not my style. For some reason I like Diplomacy much more than this one.

The English title is, I'm the Boss.
A completely random and extremely chaotic ‘negotiation’ game.  I feel it is overrated, perhaps because of Sid Sackson's name. I do like Sid Sackson (Focus, Acquire, Sleuth,) but I'm very disappointed with this game. It's total chaos. More than half the playing cards are designed to throw the game off its normal flow.  If you take this game seriously, you will be very disappointed, otherwise for an hour’s worth of a crazy wild ride it can be fun.

Egy igazi "funy" játék, amit kár, hogy csak hatan lehet játszani!
Nagyon hasonlít a Monopolyra, de annál sokkal szórakoztatóbb! A lényeg, hogy megy körbe-körbe a bábu a táblán, ahol megáll, ott meg lehet vásárolni.
Az aktuális játékosnak lehet ajánlatokat tenni a szükséges részvényekre, amikre mások rá tudnak licitálni, illetve másokat tudnak "elreptetni". És ezen kívül ki tudják játszani az "I'm the Boss" kártyájukat, amikkel ők válnak főnökké, azaz velük kell megegyezni a többieknek.

RATING: 4
Didn't get me. There's not much incentive to negotiate while the shares are small, which leads to a "build up hand until someone cracks and starts making deals" opening that is tedious. I also dislike arbitrary screwage, which this game has in spades. However, it's short, and doesn't require a lot of thinking, which can be nice on occasion.

RATING: 8
Easily the most fun negotiation game I've played, because it's so freeform and it doesn't (with the groups I've played with) suffer from the problem of people feeling hard done by. There are some clever design decisions, like having the powerful recruitment effect require three cards rather than one (compare to the overpowered "Deal Breaker" card in the Monopoly Deal Card Game). I like the randomised suspense-building endgame too, though there does seem to be a slight problem of the person who gets the last deal having the best shot of winning. But really, this game takes a few minutes to explain, is (unusually) great with six players, doesn't outstay its welcome and is a huge amount of fun. It's with good reason that it's become a firm LoB favourite.

An awful negotiation game. 
There really isn't anything to negotiate - except to cause the perceived leader to fall back.

Game design as simple and effective as it gets, relying purely on negotiation and communication. It reminds a bit of Dragon's Gold (which has been released later I know). The only criticism I have is that I think the colour coding, the different cards and the board could have been more efficient and less confusing when it comes to supplying the necessary information. 

EDIT (5 Plays): The more I play it the less I enjoy it. I still think the premise is good and with the right people, it can be a good laugh but sometimes I feel that there is next to no control over what happens and it all depends on random card draws. I would not mind that if it was not for the possibility to eliminate players by recruiting their investors, which is always a sure fire premature loss and that is utterly frustrating for the players. 

Also, I do not like the idea that you are able to divide the money (instead of shares) too, because it makes the game less cutthroat.

Had high hopes for this one but is just has not been properly thought through by Sackson.

RATING: 7
Only played this twice. You’re enjoyment of the game is very dependent on your gaming group. The first time I played this (with people I didn’t know very well), I found that everyone else was playing *too* strategically, which resulted a lackluster endgame – almost everyone was able to hoard cards near the end of the game. The second time I played this (with people I did know well), I realized how easy it was to hoard cards so I took a different strategy by trying to make a deal almost every time my turn came up. I lost miserably, made preposterous deals (and laughed until I almost peed), but at least I was able to reduce the chaos factor. Still, this game is more about chaos than deal making. So this game, to me, is more for the laughs than for the competition.

UPDATE: Upped from 6 to 7. Better than Traders of Genoa, but you really can't compare that game to this one. This is chaotic, loud fluff with just a bit more strategy and depth than Pit.

I wish they published this game as a card game instead. The board is almost superfluous.

"I'm the Boss" is boardgame perfection.  I have a friend who hates boardgames...always has to be outdoors, always has to be doing outside activities or watching or playing sports.  He is always is talking "smack" about sports...but in a fun,energetic way. A very fun, popular guy.  I had one opportunity to get him to play boardgames on a bet I won.   I knew it had to be good.  So I picked this one.  He loved it.  And so did everyone one else.  It was an absolute riot.

An interesting game of high-energy negotiations.  The actual execution seems highly dependent on well-matched bargaining styles.  In my opinion, players need to be willing to kill the deal rather than take a small piece of the pie, otherwise the game goes too quickly, lacks a dynamic nature, and heavily favors the deal initiator.

When you're the boss, it feels like you're in the pit of a stock market.  In trying to put together a multi-player deal, you will go through agreements, renegotiations, power shifts, last-second snafus.  Once a deal is opened for negotiation, everything happens in real-time: cards rashly being thrown down, people pleading for you to take pity, yelling because you backed out of an agreement, or threatening blackmail.  It's like trying to shut a door that has many hidden hinges at strange angles, suddenly folding at the wrong moment.  But the strength of the design holds chaos at bay: no matter how strange a direction the deal on the table takes, the resources you need to close it are almost always available.  A fun game that I would categorize as terribly vicious if it weren't so light and breezy.  A game I would categorize as trivially light and breezy if it weren't for the strong, wire-thin backbone to it.

After about 4 plays of this game I am bumping this to an 8. This just hits the sweet spot for our group. Lot's of negotiation, take that, and alliance... all in about 60 minutes playing time. I have enjoyed each of my plays of this game and look forward to each new play.

After even more plays, this game creeps up to a 9 for me. As a negotiation game, this one hits the top for me and my group. We have become shrewd investors and can't wait to play this when it comes out. 
Even more plays, and this game shines. Never a dull moment.

A standard Sid Sackson game - this one was only slightly well-designed, but so blastedly aggressive, it makes me uncomfortable to play.  I did well at it, but only because I realized early on that the best way to do well is to make any amount of money you can on every deal you can get into.  There was a bit of stochastic luck in the draw, which determines whether you can get into the deals or not.  I hate the fact that you can keep arbitrating deals until everyone is "happy", which means almost nobody is!  Yuck!

I wanted to like this negotiation game, but dammit if my group didn't ruin it.  No one ever wanted to do anything than a fair split.  Even when you had the leverage to make slightly lopsided deals and it was in other players' interests to take those deals, my group would never agree to anything other than a fair split, removing any negotiation from this "negotiation game."  I wish there was some mechanism to prevent this from happening (as other negotiation games have), but there wasn't.

very accessible Interactive Euro 

This game is so hard to teach in a conventional manner...it just makes no sense when you lay it out logically. The poster child for 'let's just start and learn as we go'--once the yelling starts and the throwing cards down on the board and dismissive handwaves and finger jabbing begins, it all becomes clear. Too clear, for many! You'll always get people who wished they had never sat down for this one.

I get so high off of all of the yelling and dealmaking that I stop caring who wins almost immediately. I'm just in it for the thrill of the deal! This of course will piss off certain players--which is when I inexplicably reduce their shares! NO! NOW YOU PAY ME HALF OF YOUR PROFIT TO ENTER THIS DEAL!

so much fun I sometimes feel guilty...I never get to yell ultimatums at people like this. Sackson, my man--thank you.

A total blast! This one generates a lot of laughter with the right group. I've found this to scale really well between 3 players and any higher number. I wish that this was the family game I had grown up with, instead of Monotony. Also, this game has *never* failed for me as a gateway game - even though the fun-factor is somewhat crowd dependent. I can see the success of I'm the Boss as a gateway game depending upon whether or not the players enjoy negotiating with one another, as it is a game of almost pure negotiation.

I'm the Boss is a game that is not mood-dependent for me, although I realize it probably would be for most people. I'll play it just about anytime, and don't expect that will ever change. There are games that I like better, games which I feel are just objectively superior, but I'm not always in the "mood" to play them. If I'm the Boss played well with 2 and were a little more intellectual, it would get a 10 from me.

Since I love auctioning, bidding, negotiating and money-making games, I thought this would be right up my alley but alas, that was not to be.

So, sure, I like Pit and all, but this takes the madness of Pit and kinda turns it into a game. No, this isn't really deep, it's chaotic, loud, and to many people, obnoxious. But, if you are in the mood it's a blast. My ultra left wing near-communist friend wins this almost everytime, then hangs his head in shame. He succumbed to Capitalist Mania! Of course, it might be winning more because the rest of us are trying to screw each other over.

  The jury is still out on this one. The new F2F edition fails to clarify certain issues, like whether it is permissible to "deal" with something other than money, for example. Could you offer "X' amount of money and one of your Influence Cards to a potential investment partner? Could you offer your "partner" a percentage increase in earnings in a subesequent deal? Could you offer to clean their windows for a month? Also some confusion about Influence Cards and exactly when they're  played.

RATING: 6.8
A fun and entertaining negotiation game.  I highly recommend that you don't give up on it after your first play - it can seem to drag a little bit as people try to figure out when they can play the different cards.  Once everyone knows what they are doing, the deal negotiations are fast, furious and fun!  Lots of player interaction (especially wronkage), so this is a fabulous one with a higher-energy group.

UPDATE: Dropping this to a 7, since I'm not always up for playing this one.  Of course, completely getting shut out in my last game might have something to do with getting a bit soured on it. :)

UPDATE #2: While doing better this time, still can't say that I'm in love with this one, although it is a fun and fast one.

I'm the Boss!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'm the Boss! is easily my favourite negotiation game, and one of the few games that plays well 6p. With the right group, it's short simple uproarious fun. The freewheeling and dealing has a way of revealing the personalities of other players, which is fascinating whatever the group, but can lead to dramatically different experiences. It can get awkward with sore losers. More than most negotiation games, I'm the Boss! smooths out the rough edges, ameliorating the risk of hurt feelings, but it does not eliminate them. 

It's a Sid Sackson design, so the rules are light and intuitive and digestible by anyone. High strategy it isn't. But there's exactly the right amount of chaos in the cards for a game of its type, and the variable end-game trigger is brilliant.

A Sid Sackson negotiation game?  I thought that would be pure gold.  Unfortunately, it has way too much luck, with your best laid plans constantly being zapped, plus it's a prime example of the problem with some negotiation games: the most dominant personalities take over, the games become random kingmaking exercises, and you're left with a sour taste and there can even be hurt feelings.  Not my idea of a good time!

I really enjoy this game.  It features simple rules, a decent playing time, and lots of fun gamer interaction.  Some people criticize this game saying it is too mean-spirited because of the high "take that" factor, but I think that is taking the game too seriously.  I don't mind any game where somebody can mess with me if doing so directly benefits them.  I mean, I would do the same thing in their position so how can I blame them?  Also it's easy to return the favor in short order, so no worries.  Overall, this is a great game that is tons of fun if you have the right people playing, but I would be very hesitant to play it with less than 4.

[F2F 04 edition] {Business, gateway; negotiation, roll-and-move, utility cards; optimal 6p} I'm the Boss is a decent family game. It has loads of fun and player interaction. Everyone is very involved. It's only good with 6p and I won't play it with fewer than 6p. Besides, it's usually better to play with a mixed group, rather than a group of gamers or boys.

I don't care for strategies, tactics or intrigues in this game. I feel happy as long as I can speak and influence others :laugh:

I'm the Boss has two minor problems: 1. it only blasts with a correct group of players; it doesn't work well with a mean group; 2. the replayability is low for a same group of people.

One of Sackson's best! A scream.

Update (5/28/07): I'm lowering it to a '7' because it's not aging well for me. Seems like the game has more to do with the cards you hold in your hand at any given time than your negotiation skills. It's still fun, and I'll play it. But it no longer shares the esteem earned by games like Chinatown, Intrige, or Traders of Genoa.

RATING: 5
This game is fun, but it's not really much of a game.  Random-end games where you can choose to use up all your resources and hope for a certain die roll to win, and otherwise you probably won't...What's the point?  I like the FUN in the game, but not the way victory is determined.  Maybe if you just went to the last deal each time I'd like it, or maybe if you could pay a certain amount to end the game after each deal (starting high and gradually decreasing).

This is exclusively a negotiation game. You attempt to gain money through negotiating deals with other players for shares. Most money wins.
There are cards in the game that help garner deals and there are also cards that help you steal other players cards. There is plenty of opportunity for 'screwage'.
The upshot of all this is, if you like negotiation games then you will probably like this one, but if you don't stay well clear. I'm ambivalent about this type of mechanic so I'm the Boss only receives a 5/10 from me.

After a second play, I've improved my rating to a 6/10, there is some tactics to be used as well in this.

Some games are incredibly fun while others tend to drag as people stockpile cards.  Suffers from the standard maladies of chaotic games:  tons of luck, kingmaker issues, etc.  Also, can get ugly.  All that said, it is great for keeping everyone involved and allows for terrific negotiations.  

Edit:  Down a point after a dozen or so playings.  There should be a card limit.   Maybe there is and I missed it in the rules.

I'm very impressed.  Every Sid Sackson game I've played has so far been a winner.  The person who taught me the game described it as "Pit crossed with Diplomacy."  I wound up doing much better than I thought I would my first game.  You have to love a game that allows players to make demands like, "Pay me four million or I'll ensure that the deal does not go through."

An excellent game with the right crowd. The game really is all about "the deal," that give and take, the cardplay and the sudden decisions that allow a deal to close and shares to be given out. I think this game heads to a "9" with the right crowd, but if everyone at the table isn't into it, I'd give the game a pass.

Great fun, but this decreases noticeably for me after 4 or so plays. Maybe I'll leave this for a year or so before coming back to it.

Tuns of screwage, but the game is fast enough that there's no time to hold vendettas.

Update: Having not played it for 10 months and then coming back to it, it is a lot of fun again. There are a few people it doesn't work for, but exclude them and it is a fun, fast (if not really very balanced) hour that causes a lot of laughs and a lot of swearing.

Rating up from 6.8 to 7.3.

Wow. This game totally surprised me. I was not expecting the game to be as fun as it is. Total chaos, but in a very fun way. Negotiate a deal for 10 minutes, reach agreement and then somebody steals the deal with an I'm the Boss card and then more negotiation goes on. This plays really well, especially with outgoing people. Even there is one or two reserved players in the game, the outgoing folks can bring them out of their shell and involved. Really fun game. The luck of the draw is involved for sure, but the point of the game is to have fun.

RATING: 8
Sid Sackson games are always lean, and I'm the Boss contains just enough frippery to make the thing work perfectly.  I'm the Boss is a noisy dealmaking game with more structure than Chinatown or Genoa.  At certain moments, this switches from a negotiation game to a trick-taking game, and the result is less satisfying but more accessible.  The board is unnecessarily hard to read, but otherwise it's a lot of fun.

RATING: 9
I know that this game is not a typical Euro game.  It was first published in Germany, by a classic American designer, so who knows what you should call it.

I call it the game that saved gaming for me.  I had become so disenchanted with the whole genre.  It had gotten to the point where all I wanted to play was Combat Commander, which is not so bad.  But I had seriously lost most interest in anything remotely Euro.  And then I played I'm the Boss.  

And even though it is not a traditional Euro, or maybe it isn't even a Euro at all, it made me want to play again.  It defines what I love in a game--interaction.  The entire game is based on interaction, deal making, cutting in on deals, hijacking other peoples' plans.  It is a decent design, but it is what the game makes people do that I love.  It makes people talk, yell, mumble, cackle.  And to add to all of this, it is a lot of fun to play.

Winner.

This game is highly dependent on who you play with. My rating is based my experiences with the 'right' kind of crowd. What is the right crowd? That's tough to say. I guess it's a group that doesn't take itself too seriously and isn't afraid to speak up. With more serious/shy types it can flounder and drag. Fortunately, either way it comes to a conclusion in no more than an hour. This and Acquire are Sid Sackson's masterworks.

Game is clean and really stripped down, something you'd expect from a Sackson classic. Theme fits really well with the mechanics and the essence of the game is basically negotiations. This game is not fun when folks are low on energy or when this is the last game of the night. You need a certain amount of back-stabbing and dealing breaking for the game to shine. Don't play with sensitive folks or couples who would carry the quarrel outside of the game. The duration of the game is just right. 10-15 deals is perfect. Any longer and the game will drag. Overall, this no-shrill no-fuss game is good only with certain types of people and even then on certain days only.

After the first play, all of the players spend their turns drawing cards so that on the rare chance that someone tries to make a deal, it will lose. The game desperately needs a different way for the cards to be gathered.

Also, metagaming is rampant and kills the game.

If these two things could be fixed, it would be a fantastic game.

This is a favorite of the local game group, due to their penchant for over-reacting in the spirit of the game and getting into borderline shouting matches over which deal a player should make. I can see the fun in that, but for the most part my plays were a little ho-hum. I think the issue for me is that the deals are almost completely arbitrary, with very little information to evaluate them with. The "I'm the Boss" cards sort of intensify this effect, allowing someone else to essentially evaluate and make the decisions for you.

There are ways to counteract some of the game's more chaotic features, but more often than not you get ambushed anyway. I find it all too luck driven for my personal taste, especially when games like Chinatown exist and do a much better job of conveying the same type of theme.

Very entertaining negotiation game of orchestrating deals.  One of the best "first impressions" I've had from a game in awhile.  Update 9/11/17: I had to downgrade my rating from 8 to 7.  That first game was amazingly fun, but subsequent games haven't been as good.  I think 5p might be the perfect amount of players: 4p is not enough, and 6p is just too chaotic.  This is one of those games that needs the right group to get full enjoyment from it.

Zany, chaotic fun.  I can see how the amount of pleasure is inversely proportional to the amount of serious thought put into each deal.  So it must be played quickly, without (too much) recrimination.  Fragile, then, but enjoyable (esp. in a family setting).

This game just did not do anything for me.  I liked it at first, but then it just boiled down to who had what cards.  If you had more stop cards than the other players had cards to stop you, more power to you.

Crazy no-holds barred negotiation game.  Probably not much fun if you lose your "main person" though.  Needs a pretty high-energy group to shine though.

Excellent.  A game I really don't like. I cannot believe how bad I thought (I know others like it but...)this game was. To make it worse is it in a big box - how many boxes of Fluxx can you fit in there.  I am still in a state of shock.  So glad I have played it though cos I don't have to play it again.  I won't either. I'm glad we all like different games - I'd hate to like this one.

Fairly cutthroat negotiation game that requires the participation of certain players... but you can force that participation by stealing their proxy. If players are into it, it can be fun.

Fun and noisy game heavily based on the special cards in your hand. Sometimes it's better to hold back your Stop and Trip cards on a better deal, and let others waste their good cards.

A negotiation game with endless interruptions?  Ugh.  God, do I hate this game.

Everything that is brilliant about other negotiation games (Intrigue, e.g.) - breakable promises, the reliance on others for victory, temporary alliances, etc. - is missing here. 

And as much as I dislike this Sackson "classic", it gets ten times worse when people even come close to taking it seriously:

"You're all ganging up on me!"

"You won't let me play cards!"

"I can't win!"

Sweet lord - someone kill me.

I must like negotiation games. I laugh all the way through this one. I try to get in deals that I have no part of. (Evidently, that is illegal so I will not do it anymore.) Great if you can leave the game play at the table and not carry bad feelings back into real life.

Normally I don't like "Take That" games, and this has a lot of it with cards flying around the table. But something about the game comes out a little better than that. I've only played the "I'm the Boss" version.

RATING: 7
Nice negotiation game with lots of "take that" cardplay. Can get a bit overwhelming with freewheeling and dealmaking going on. The boss can force the action at a pace some players can't compete with, feeling left out of the gameplay. But still, easy to learn and plays quickly.

I've admittedly only played this once, but I didn't find the experience of negotiation within the framework of this game particularly appealing.  I should probably try it again before passing permanent judgement.

The theme doesn't interest me at all, but it does encourage a lot of backstabbing, cutthroat deals and it doesn't feel too intense at all.  Even though I enjoyed it the two times I played it, I just don't feel compelled to play it again.

I like this game. Negoiation heavy. Can be bad for people though who don't feel they are part of the game or deal though. But that's business I guess. Very happy to have this as part of my collection.

Coax, goad, or threaten your opponents into making deals happen the way you want them to happen.  Fierce but fun chaos ensues!  This is a type of game whose enjoyment potential is heavily dependent on my mood.

After 1 Play: This really felt like an old-fashioned game.  There doesn't seem to be enough incentive to take the cards, which results in rather dull gameplay.

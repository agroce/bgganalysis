RATING: N/A
Good setting, nice components, reasonably enjoyable. There is attacky fun here for many players. It's a game full of chance and direct conflict, with plenty of scope for kingmaking, but it does provoke laughter constantly throughout, as you endure diarrhoea, bear attacks, sunstroke, tiredness and hunger. Player elimination is a feature which won't suit some. It feels like it throws out all the game design lessons of the last twenty years and plays like a teenage boy's fantasy game... which is actually exactly how it started out according to the design history in the rulebook. 

Traded for Black Friday. Ultimately, there was nothing clever enough in the design of Wilderness to make me return for a second play, and it wasn't a hit with my fellow gamers either.

Nice game but u might get disappointed if ur expecting a heavy gamer's game. What u get here is a very good family game with a good theme and a lot of randomness. Big + for it being able to modifying it very easily, making it possible to play a shorter or longer version, depending on how much time u have to spare.

I had high hopes for this game given the theme, but in the end this has barely anything to do with real survival skills and is made up mostly of luck--dice rolls and card draws control the majority of the action.  There is a slight bit of resource management in the action points and energy consumption, but with very few available actions, no inventory of any kind, and almost all actions beginning or ending in die rolls or card draws, you have a game devoid of almost any skill and very little fun.

With simple rules and straightforward gameplay, this creates good tension and the feeling of limited resources. You need to hit the leaders with the bad event cards. Otherwise the game ends up as a rather random race.

A lovingly crafted original. Survival feels like such a neglected theme. And the game does a great job of evoking the feeling of trying to survive in the wilderness. The variety of conditions that can occur each day is well done, and the mechanics feel right. The likelihood of a successful hunt, getting lost trying to move at night, contracting illnesses, fighting off animals, and getting more hungry, thirsty and tired while doing it all feel perfect. Random cards often ruin games like this, but I thought they were well balanced and added enough player interaction (read screwage) to heighten the tension and keep everyone in it. An experience game, but unique and well worth owning.

Origineel spel waarin de spelers proberen te overleven in de wildernis. Ze moeten proberen het dorp te bereiken aan de overkant van de kaart. Ze krijgen honger en dorst, waardoor de vermoeidheid extra hard toeslaat. Geregeld rusten, en proberen te eten en drinken is de boodschap. Maar het weer is je niet altijd goed gezind, en er liggen wilde dieren op de loer. De kaarten waarmee je jezelf kan helpen of je medespelers een loer draaien, zorgen voor animo.

You have been robbed and left for dead in the middle of nowhere. Without proper clothes or equipment, you must reach the civilized village before you die from hunger, thirst or exhaustion. But there are wild animals lurking, mountains blocking the way, and a wide variety of unpleasant diseases waiting to invade your body. When you think it cannot possibly get any worse, you feel a taunting raindrop on your cheek. Race to the nearest civilized village – but the village is not near, and the way there is not paved. You will have to find water, search for food, avoid wolves, bears and snakes, endure sicknesses and keep your strength up to be able to get there.

Player elimination is this games downfall in my view.  It is very difficult to come back from a bad animal attack.  Suggest playing the game in its shortened 4 tile format to stop it dragging.

Nice game. Hard, it's no family game, dying with your pawn is not fun, but in a experienced group really good. 
Sure, there is a lot of luck included, on the cards drawn, on the dice rolls, but that's life.
And outcome depends as well on, how hard the players are playing..., together, next or against...

RATING: 6
Pretty easy game and due to random layout worth playing again. Assets like animals, weather and sickness cards are nice and beneficial for the game. The Event Cards have a slightly too heavy impact, because you start with already 3 of them on your hand. If you do not play them (which can easily be because you do not need them from the start) you end up with lots of cards that actually decide the outcome and the speed of the game. We are figuring out whether to start with fewer if not any Event Cards, apart from the weather card amount advice.

Spännande att se ett försök att göra ett spel där både spelet och motspelarna ger motstånd.
Jag har just studerat Knizias Lord of the Rings, där man samarbetar mot spelet, och har själv velat göra ett spel med en mix av liknande mekanismer som där, men med mer fokus på motspelarna och i kamp mot dem.
Det här kändes dock lite för turartat (även om jag välförtjänt slogs ut pga av dåligt spel).
Det senare (att man kan slås ut) är kanske också lite av ett problem, även om det ju tematiskt sett är helt rätt.

OOPS! I WROTE IN SWEDISH BY MISTAKE!

Wilderness always offers blood, sweat and tears... and a lot of laughter. A fantastic game for large groups of gamers and non-gamers alike. It is practically always requested on my gaming nights.
To succeed, you have to make careful plans, but also be prepared for when the plans fail. Every game is different because of the modular game board, day cards and event cards. Some games most players die, while other times noone dies.
Great game!

Just bought this game out of curiosity and loving the theme. Will play it during my next game session and hope to have tons of enjoyment. It's simple and it only took me 30 minutes to finish reading the rule book and another 15 minutes to read it the second time. Now i am gear up to play it and see how it goes. It is not a cheap game but the game looks promising so far. My only grip is the meeple that is used to represent the characters and animals, which comes with stickers. Being a miniature fan, i prefer at least a nice miniature, judging from the price which is not cheap at all. Will post an update after our first play.

[Update: after one play, i find the game was simple and fun to learn and play. In three players game, two characters died half way through, mainly due to animal attack, and yes, they are nasty. Overall, a very enjoyable family and party game with some in build twist for surprises.

Second update: after two plays, the game seems to appeal to more mature players though not conclusive. My nieces who are age between 13-16 don't really enjoy the "cruelty" aspect of the game and not getting use to the "screw other players" mechanism. However, my third game with my usual gaming group was a blast! It packs with lots of twists especially from the event and weather cards and it is a fun game mainly as a filler before or in between heavy games to us.]

Great game. Although it has player elimination we use house rules to fix this if someone dies. The artwork isn't the best I've seen, but it works! The game and the theme are like one. When you play you feel that you are in the wilderness fighting to survive! Totally Awesome!

Note: The rulebook says you can play 2-8 players and in theory you can. But in reality 6 players is the maximum you'll want to be.

I truly enjoy this game and have played it several times with many different friends and I keep recomending it. 

It is generally easy to learn and to relate to. It is well thought through and balanced. The artwork is awesome and it looks very professional. Some people find it difficult to see the difference between "energy" and "exhaustion" but once learned the game is a breeze. It is very easy for everyone to create tactics and strategies since the needs and means for survival is within us all.

I really like Wilderness and recommend it highly. It plays smoothly and isn’t too taxing on the brain so it can be used as an entry game for new gamers. It is a good family game with children age 10+ I think. The rules are straightforward with just enough depth for me. Its not overly detailed with too many choices, yet there is enough to challenge you. The replayability is huge. It is a competitive game which allows for aggression if you want to take that approach but you don’t have to.

A lot of thought has gone into the design and good attention in the presentation as the terrain is artistically clear and appealing to the eye. The components are of a high standard. It won’t take you too long to get up and playing although there is a bit of down time to set up, though not a lot. The replayability is a strong plus to this game. No two games will be the same as there are plenty of variables.

A warning: There can be player elimination if you press your luck too much but it is unlikely if you balance your choices and decisions as to how and when you play it conservative and when you push yourself. You can choose when you play nice, and when you stick it to the other players. And its a race of survival. Of course some players may not survive. Also, there are a good mix of meaningful decisions to make but you shouldn’t get bogged down by analysis paralysis. This game is played for fun, not to make your head explode. Excellent!

There is a fair amount of luck but this is tempered by your choice as to how you use your action points. I would say that there is a nice balance. To be honest, you would need a lot of luck to survive in a situation like this and the luck element, to me, adds to the fun.

Absolutely, my type of game. If you like light-medium complexity and good thematic adventure and if the thought of a race game with survival being key interests you, you will really enjoy Wilderness.

Survival travelling game in which the theme is very well brought out in the game detail.
The event cards work either as an improvement for the player holding the card or an knock back for another player(s). This allows the game to turn to an "attack the leader" style game which when coupled with player elimination may be too much for some. Personally I do not enjoy player elimination games, unless the games are very quick indeed, which leaves me not seeking further plays of this game.

Wilderness is a survival/race gem, featuring solid game design, quick gameplay, and an engrossing atmosphere.

My girlfriend and I played our first game of Wilderness tonight and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Well, I did, right up until the point where I kicked the bucket. Starvation brought me to my knees four hexes from the finish line after getting lost trying to find food. Died a sad, lonely death in an unknown forest. Nearly cried. Girlfriend was ecstatic (can see Wilderness at the table often).

Our initial thoughts during unboxing were that whilst the artwork is fitting and adds to the theme, Wilderness would greatly benefit with a reskin, better components, a more logical rulebook, and nicer box cover artwork (currently a little bland). However, looks aren't everything, and after 30 mins of playtime I didn't really feel like this all mattered too much. The imagery is passable (certainly not an eyesore), and the gameplay more than makes up for any graphical shortcomings.

The unpredictable nature (pun intended) of Wilderness is a treat; the event cards, the sickness cards, the way the animals move and attack, the weather (damn you Weather Gods), and terrain/hidden map... It all makes for an incredibly thematic experience, one that I highly recommend if you can look past the production values.

I'm coming for you Village!

RATING: 3.5
After first couple of tries: I didn't know much about the game when I tried it for the first time. Didn't even know it's a racing game. Interesting racing games are difficult to create, and this isn't one of the best. 

Theme is great, and implementataion of the theme is good. 
Artwork is a bit sketchy, but choices of colors are exellent. 

There are quite a few layout mistakes, here are the ones I've found sofar: 
On the board where hunting is explained the number "1" is almost invisible because it's printed ontop of the pictures spearhead. 
Some of the cards with exactly the same wording have different line wraping. 
There are some strange grammar and language on some cards. 

What about the actual game then? Well, it's a racing game with movment and action cards. Quite simple base mechanics. 

Since the cards are very strong the game is very random and strategy is difficult to apply. Many cards are used to counter certain situations that you might never encounter. This is somewhat balanced with two choices of actions on each card though. That in combination with the fact that you only get a few new cards during the game sets the possibilities for different players very unfair from the start of the game with no or little chance to turn your luck. 

The animals are too strong when they show up near a player, and doesn't affect the players at all when they are a few hexes behind. When you end up alone with an animal and without any cards to escape you will eventually die if you don't have enough energy to move two squares, and you seldom do after an animal attack. The animals gives more exhaustion than sleep recovers, so there is no escape. 

Since the cards have two actions each there would have been more variation if every card had unique combinations of actions even if some actions appears on more than one card. As it is now some cards have exact duplicates. 

The neatest part of the game is the thirst/hunger/exhaustion mechanics, they work well and are logical. There were some mistakes done with moving the exhaustion, the player board should say that you should add one exhaustion to the sum from thirst/hunger. That the marker hides the numbers is also a mistake. The markers are a bit small and thus difficult to pick up. Maybe cubes would have been better. 

The game is also eliminating players. That is something that many modern gamers don't like. It's no fun sitting watching while the others finish the game waiting for the next game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It is good, scales nicely for player numbers (although, with some opponents, two player mode will guarantee no survivors) and a choice between using cards to help yourself or hinder others reduces any runaway leader problem plus avoids too many players being eliminated before the last few turns.
I did consider buying it in 2011 when the price for the prototype would have made my Essen baggage a lot easier to pack but was happy to get it in 2012 for the retail price.

Wilderness is not perfect, but I'm giving it a 10 because it has managed to combine just about everything I enjoy into one game. I would play it any time, happily.  It has a lot of things you can adjust about it.  It's not slick, but it is simply a fun game and really great for families.  Also, when I ran into a problem the Fryx brothers were right there to answer it and my missing spinner part is being sent by them personally.  Great game, great company!

Theme:  My favorite themes revolve around survival and nature.  There's even wild animals that can kill players!

Race:  I love racing games, but can't seem to find one to suit my time needs.  This one has adjustable play length.  Perfect!

2-8 Players:  This can play well even with 2 players.  I'm not sure about 8, but the range of players is excellent.

Simple Rules:  The rules are not convoluted.  They're easy to remember and make sense with the theme.

Artwork:  I'm sorry, but for those complaining about the artwork, it's really rather evocative of the atmosphere.  In fact, with no knowledge of what people have said, my wife said, "I enjoy the art work.  It helps me get into the game."  The box is really beautiful and, hey, it's a great color of green.

I think it's great.  And most importantly, my wife loves it!

RATING: 5
A survival/racing game on a modular hex board; you're constantly fighting against thirst, hunger and most importantly exhaustion, and the possibility of not making it out alive is very real after one or two strategic blunders, or taking a calculated risk and then simply being unlucky.

Theme is good and the game has some interesting ideas and it does build up the pressure nicely, but the gaming experience as a whole feels a little bit too old-fashioned and generally leaves a lot to be desired.

This game is ok, and is fun to play to an extent , except for the fact you can be eliminated and then have to watch the rest of the game. And it is possible to get elimanted fairly easily if someone decides to move an animal to attck you and you lose heavily.

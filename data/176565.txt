RATING: 5
Quick abstract/card-drafting game where the playing board is made entirely of cards, which are worth VP and give you an action. In order to to pick up those cards, players must play cards in order to move their ninjas around the playing board. But if a player is unable to move, they are eliminated from the game. Thus, the game is about juggling your ninjas around while balancing the need for VP and the need for maneuverability. 

My biggest criticism is that I prefer the game with more than less. With 2-players, there simply isn't enough going on between turns to keep the gameplay dynamic and interesting. But with 4-players, the game manages to create tension with moderately brain-burning decisions. Overall, it's an elegant and intriguing design built around a very simple ruleset.

Ninja Camp is by no means a perfect game, but it is a heck of a lot of fun, and a great value for a small box game. My only complaint is the size of the board. It is 2ft. by 3ft. when fully set up. I feel like 2x2 tiles would have been a much better fit for this game.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
Seems a lot like "Hey, thats my fish" with special powers.  Pretty fun for a short filler, and does offer enough choices due to having to balance some of the good abilities vs getting more points.  Not something I would request to play often, but is fun and would be willing to play every so often.

This is another kickstarter creation, so lower your expectations accordingly... 

Not a whole lot to say about this one, its pretty much 'Hey That's My Fish' with variable movement and special powers. Not a bad game, but I find it more fiddly to setup then HTMF so I'm not really sure when its going to get played. A word of warning... Its very easy to get yourself trapped in this game, so be careful or you can find yourself waiting a long time for the game to end.

Had a bad first impression of the game but overall it is an okay game. I find it goes on a little long and my natural expectation for a game with "ninja" in the title is that it would be exciting - which it isn't. The theme really could be anything here - like a supermarket challenge where you compete to get items before another player.

RATING: 8
This is a great game that plays reasonably quickly.  Ninja Camp is somewhat akin to Hey That's My Fish in that you are positioning multiple pawns on a grid of elements (card/tiles) that are removed as the pawns move, reducing the available play area.  However, the cards you pick up affect both your score and how you may move your pawns on future turns.   The variety of moves provides several interesting options but few enough to run through them quickly when teaching new players.  Usually, I play a couple games with new players since it's quick enough and they usually have a decent grasp (grapple?) after one quick playthrough.  Ninja Camp has replaced the other game with the lame name.  Plus highkicking purple ninja meeples!!!

Very fun strategic game for the whole family. I haven't played 2 games of this that ever felt the same, since the random board, random/chosen racial ability, and the "activites & badges" mini-expansion always keep things very fresh.

Bought for the boy to bring to day care. Similar to Pingvinas/Hey That's My Fish, but with more tactical decisions due to card play. I'm terrible at this game, but it's not bad. Takes up a lot of table space for a card game though, so be warned.

RATING: 9
This is probably my favorite game from Action Phase.  I was really fortunate to get the chance to play test it early on and throughout a few different revisions.  The game was always good, but final version is really superb.  The choices you have to make during the game to prepare you for the end of the game when you know you'll have less places to move are all really interesting.  I played it several times at Gen Con and never got worn out. 

Also the stretch goal meeples (particularly the purple one!) are really awesome.

FUN: very simple rules, yet deep strategic and tactical gameplay. Funny theme and artwork.

UNIQUE: it's not very unique as it is very reminiscant of Hey, That's My Fish and Sugar Gliders, but the addition of abilities to the points you pick up, is very clever.

NEGATIVES: there's a huge amount of possible moves at the beginning and it becomes less while playing. Usually you want your game to ramp up the other way.

At it's heart this is an abstract strategy game where players have to plan their moves carefully and way in advance. However the lighthearted theme and presentation ease the barrier to entry, as this is actually a pretty simple game to get to grips with.

An enjoyable card game where the cards are movement cards placed in a grid. You play a movement card to move one of your ninjas, picking up whichever card they leave. Your aim is to gather as many points as possible as well as managing to stay on the board as long as possible. The higher valued cards have more limited movement possibilities, the lower valued cards are more flexible. If you cannot move, you have to pass and not move for the rest of the game. Don't let the tiny box fool you, this game takes up plenty of table space.

I got to play this prior to Gencon, and thought it was really clever. The two things that stood out to me were 1) easy to learn/teach (very important to me), and 2) it has as much "thinkiness" as you want. It's easy to imagine having a few beers and just taking your turn without paying a lot of attention, but it's also easy to see myself trying to really concentrate on which cards my opponents have, which they've played, and which are still in their hand while strategizing my play. It really is that flexible I think. My kids could learn it, but my gamer friends would enjoy it (on a different level) too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun to play, quick game-play can have kids suffer from some AP, but that's good for learning.  Main issue is the length of setup on a table.  It almost requires use of a non-slip surface when setting up and playing.

The Ninja Meeples are awesome!  The cards feel good and are of good stock.  

I would imagine playing with 4 players would get hectic in a hurry and the game would be much shorter in time than with just 2.

RATING: 7
A neat little game that is very reminiscent of "Hey! That's My Fish!" without feeling derivative at all.
Ninja Camp is definitely the deeper game though. If you know what you're doing, you can totally take someone out of the game very quickly. Depending on where walls come out and what cards get taken, it's very easy to isolate someone from being able to move at all. I feel like this aspect is both the game's best quality and most noticeable weakness. For a game that's advertised to families, it shouldn't be so easy to lock someone out of available moves. At the same time, I appreciate this level of depth in a game of this nature. You can help avoid this by telling people to not focus in on one type of card. I also really like that Ambush cards are worth so many points, but are almost never useful unless your opponent(s) aren't paying attention.

This was an interesting game that reminded me a bit of battle sheep or hey that's my fish. I think I prefer HTMF of the three for its theme and elegance and pure abstractness, but I still like the kungfu-panda esque theme of this one and of battle sheep's fun fighting sheep theme.

For this one, I think it probably has more replay than HTMF because of the variety of cards, but I find HTMF more strategic and plannable. This one is a bit more tactical than I like - turn by turn, you can plan and make pretty good choices and maybe see 1-3 turns ahead, but there's no way to envision an endgame given how dynamic the board state is and how different cards interact.

But I like that you don't know who is in the lead, and i like that it plays fast and is replayable with its cards and character cards.

The box cover of the kicking monkey should have have shown the monkey roundhouse kicking a penguin because this game completely fires Hey, That's My Fish!. This delivers a similar experience, but the addition of the card dictated movement adds a lot of strategy and interesting decisions. The decision between getting high point cards or very useable movement cards is an interesting one and getting the balance right is a challenge. This game is easy to teach and quick to play, but the gameplay has some depth to it as well.

I'd say this is a slightly more complex version of Hey That's My Fish. Unfortunately the added complexity (card ability) doesn't add much depth to the gameplay. It is also unfortunate that the default movement direction is reduced to 4 sides. I'd rather play Hey That's My Fish.

RATING: 7
A nice filler. You lay out an array of the cards, and place your three ninjas. Each turn you move one of your ninjas according to a card you discard from your hand, picking up the card he moved from. When the board is all traps and walls, players pass and end the game. Score is all the cards you've collected, played or not.

A small hand management movement game that feels original and has a cute theme, but only really works with 2 players, and there are far better 2 player games out there.

It's just like Hey That's My Fish!, but where the tiles you pick up dictate the types of moves you can make. Worth a try, nothing earth-shattering.

I'm sure tons of others have made this comment but this game plays pretty much exactly like Hey That's My Fish but with special abilities and action cards....in my book that makes this the superior game and I got rid of my copy of Hey! as a result.

HTMF with "powers".  each card (ice floe) you leave is a card in your hand that is also a movement.  you play a card/movement from your hand next turn, dictating how you move.  

cards = points too.  low value sseem to be better moves.

Interest game where the "board" gets smaller and smaller as you play your cards.  Doesn't seem to have much strategy at first, but as the game gets closer to ending, you will be staring at the board for the perfect move.

My kids love this game.  I think it is their favorite.  One of the top 3 for sure.  Fun, simple and full of decisions.

Rating based on one play and discussion at GenCon 2015. Game is really good! Hey that's my fish ++. The abilities are good but not oppressive and the game play is fast. I was very pleasantly surprised. The theme is silly but it works out overall.

Aspiring animal Ninja wannabes go to camp in hopes that a fighting style will be named after them. Simple gateway abstract strategy deck builder game with hand management. Seed a grid of action cards that score points when played. Play an action card from your hand and complete the corresponding action by moving your tokens around the grid while avoiding traps and obstacles. Pickup the card from your start position to add to your hand simultaneously reducing available safe squares on the grid. First player to be trapped without a move triggers the end scoring. Occasionally you will forget which card you started from.

Decent and quick strategy filler game. Always feels just right for what it is.

Saw in action at Gen Con. I can't imagine a worse way to spend my time. Needlessly fiddly, bad artwork and theme (a terrible children's cartoon from five years ago had the same idea), long setup, too much table space, and from a company whose other games were also mediocre to terrible. I wouldn't back this in a billion years.

Very enjoyable filler. This is basically a gamer version of Hey! That's My Fish! with unique player powers, more interesting gameplay, and quicker setup. Bye bye little penguins.

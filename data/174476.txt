On 4p game, my coplayers really didn't enjoy it, as it ended with 'who first catch the other 2 players identity' - he has so much point advantage above others... And all of us were hiding. Too much police, too little space, blocking each other.

Light deduction filler in which you are trying to kill off your targets while not giving away your identity. Has some nice concepts, but it seems mostly guess and check at some point in the game. Still can be entertaining.

KS Version

When played in 1 against 1, you will has a wonderful experience: It is "kind of easy" to remember all the suspects and try to guess your opponent's hitman and/or targets. And guessing these things is enjoyable. It creates a sort of "battle of brains" :)

But once you play this game with 3 or 4, there is a sort of chaos created and that awesome feeling disappears.
Instead, what you get is a "hunt for the very first hitman who killed its target". It is not bad, but it feels different and I prefer the "battle of brains" feeling over a game of hunt.

Did not click with me..seems long with a single strategy to kill as many of your targets as fast as possible and then start accusing (even blindly) to get the assassins of your adversaries..pass.

Book keeping is tedious in the game to determine who can be the possible killer and target. A wrong book keeping will end up causing the game to be 'unfair' and have to be restarted. Good idea, bad execution.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
I knew going in this wasn't going to be my kind of game, but I am always willing to give a game a shot one time, pretty much no matter what it is.  Felt like the game really didn't have many choices, and while it was kind of interesting trying to hide who you really were, all your plans will most likely just get screwed up before your next turn.  I also found the police very difficult to see, which made it really easy to screw up the whole game.

Cute game that makes you think a bit and speaks to the detective in me - can take a lot longer than ten minutes though - especially if played with strategic players.

This game takes out different gamestyles in different gamegroups and it wasn't a hit in mine given it quickly became very aggressive hunts on any player who did their job. With focus more on finding who was guilty and less on doing what your character was supposed to do it wasn't as great of a game and was left unplayed in the shelf with less and less wish for it to be played again. So I decided to rid myself of the expansion (didn't add so much and it was kickstarter exclusive so I thought I'd find someone who wanted it) but I got a great offer for the full package and decided to take it.

Small deduction filler. Not exactly my type of game but it offers a lot of gameplay for that short amount of time.
Every turn you have to choose two from a bunch of different available actions in order to kill your targets while hiding your own identity.

10' to kill is a deduction game marinated in chess.
What i mean about that is that in 10' to kill you are a hitman who no one knows about, you who has a contract on three targets that runs around in a city that only you know about. But in that city there is several other player controlled hitmen that you dont know that also have three target that only they know about and every time a character is killed the police appears and everybody runs off. Each player controlled hitman has 2 actions on her turn.

* move character/police to anywhere on the board. 
* assassinate (only one time on your turn) 
* Investigate (with the police) 

We will take these action on at the time.

Moving is straight forward, you take any character on the board (hitman, civilan, police) and move anywhere on the board. 

Assassinate is where you kill a character, you can kill with a knife (on the same tile) with a pistol (on an adjecent tile) or with a sniper (on a straigh line from the sniper nest anywhere on the board). 
This is the action that most people do something wrong but you cannot say that you did wrong until the end of the game since you dont want to reveal who YOUR hitman is. 
Targets gives you 1 point, Other Hitmen 3 points, Civs -1 and police officers -1334 points. 

Investigate is where you take a police and ask another player "is this you hitman?" and if it is, you get points and if you are wrong to bad you just lost one action. 

It is easy enough to understand but deep enough to master. 

Did i mention that all the characters are cute animals? 

Really fun filler fast to set up and fast to learn.

Un filler gracioso en que tenemos que matar sin que nos descubran. A su vez tenemos que deducir quienes son los asesinos de los otros jugadores. No es fácil buscarse una coartada adecuada ni esquivar a la policía pero aún así se encuentran buenas ocasiones para matar a nuestros objetivos.

RATING: 9
Interesting deduction game.  We break it out as a quick filler.  

A few type-o's in the instructions and weird French to English translation in a few spots.  For example the apostrophe in France apparently means "minutes" hence 10' means "10 minutes".  The US, the apostrophe looks weird right after a number and doesn't mean anything.  

Also, there is one game mechanic that feels off...you need to kill three targets.  For a least one player, two can come pretty quick.  The game ends when that player gets three.  At the point it is very difficult to find them and then still allow time for you to win.  

Still, a good game, and I am glad to have it in my collection.

Si vous êtes passé au local dernièrement, vous avez vu qu'on avait une nouvelle expo sur l'illustratrice Pauline Detraz. Toute la partie du bas est justement sur 10 minuts to Kill, illustré par Pauline. Vous incarnez un tueur à gage (secret) et vous allez devoir éliminer vos contrats, sans vous faire remarquer. Pour plus de précision, je vous suggère de lire l'exceeellleennnttttt article sur ludovox : "Journal d'un tueur à gage" fait sur ce jeu (Ok, c'est moi qui l'ai rédigé, alors je me fais mousser un peu :) ). En jouant, n’hésitez pas à regarder les tuiles quartiers avec un peu d'attention, vous pourrez trouver quelques surprises ...

Note : Vous avez pu voir au local une nouvelle affiche représentant notre élan (du groupe ELAN). C'est une illustration originale de Pauline faite pour la triche et représentant notre élan en personnage de "10 minuts to kill".

Pour 2 à 4 Ryo Saeba (ceux qui liront mon article comprendront :) ) pour des parties de un peu plus de 10 minutes quand même (disons plutôt 15-20, mais "15-20 minuts to kill", c'est naze, comme nom de jeu :) )

RATING: 4
Neat theme, but this deduction game suffers from first/early player advantage. Going first allows you to make maximum use of the game board setup and your first of three kills is often without much risk compared to players who go later who have to deal with the positioning of the police characters and potential bunching of characters. Removing characters on shared spaces seems to be a valid way to hide in a crowd but eliminated or other players can easily drop a police character to stop kill actions while gun and sniper spots only work to hide if there are multiple valid source spaces to a valid target space. Bluffing possibility seems sub par since wasting actions is bad and killing the wrong things can be penalizing.

10 to Kill is quick deduction game where you are trying to kill specific targets, other player's hit men, and avoid bystanders. Simultaneously, you'll be trying to keep the identity of your own hit man a secret. On your turn, you will do two actions. This will ideally be moving a character and killing a character, but sometimes is just moving two. You can kill via gun, sniper rifle, and knife. As you kill people, the cops will show up and make killing a little harder to do. In addition, you can try to capture other people's hit men. I kind of made me feel a little like a multiplayer game of Mr. Jack. I say this because when you kill someone, there are only so many people that could have killed that character based on the parameters of the various weapons. I like that there is no player elimination, even when your hit man has been killed or captured. All that said, there are many other filler games that I would prefer to play over this one.

INITIAL IMPRESSION 

An interesting deduction game. The different ways to kill are cool and you have to take a lot of things into consideration as to not give yourself away. Gameplay takes closer to 20 mins

The game is easy to mess up, which is probably why they say to state where the kill could have came from. I wish the police stood out a little more at a glance and I wish their was a better player AID card to assist people since this a light game, there is a high chance of having new players.

In close to 10 minutes, you will assassinate your targets while pitting the blame on others to keep your identity a secret. The deduction is fluid, as a quickly paced game. It takes a few plays, however, to fully understand the eligible kills. It is easy to make an illegal kill at first. This is unfortunate because it will likely take you out of the game. It is quick, easy to set up, but only somewhat rewarding. To shorten the game length, the deduction isn't quite as solid as other games, so your decisions feel a bit less impactful than I'd like. I do though, like this as an opener to game night.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2015)

Before playing 10' to Kill, I didn’t even have heard of it, but it is a fun deduction game.

The art is cool and the game components are also nice. The rules are easy to teach and it plays very fast so you don’t mind the luck of the game (the variable setup).

I particularly like the fact that you have to try to accomplish your kills while at the same time you are trying to make it hard for your opponents to know your identity. It also has a memory element I love.

Bottom line, 10' to Kill is fun and quick! I would definitively play it again and perhaps it can go up in my personal ratings. The best feature is its short playtime.

Ich bin so schlecht in dem Spiel. Eine Person killen und dann waren da natürlich 4 Personen vom Gegner als Verdächtige dabei, die der gleich ausschliessen kann... Was soll man machen?
Ein Deduktionsspiel mit einfachen Regeln. Es sind 10 Personen auf 10 Plättchen in der Mitte. Jeder bekommt verdeckt einen dieser Personen als "Killer" zugelost und zusätzlich 3 "Opfer".
In einem Zug darf man 1 Person (egal welche, auch nicht die eigenen) bewegen und danach darf man eine Person killen (entweder gegnerischer Killer oder einen seiner Opfer), aber nur, wenn sein eigener Killer auch schießen darf oder sich auf dem gleichen Feld wie das Opfer befindet, aber nicht wenn ein Polizist in der Nähe ist..
Die Regeln, wann darf mein Killer schiessen und wann nicht muss man 1. verstehen und 2. im Spiel sehr genau aufpassen. Wenn man es falsch macht ist das Opfer doch nicht gestorben und man hat ne Menge von sich preisgegeben...

A different game, which covers a niche in every board game collection.

PROS
- It just plays differently from other games
- Very interesting when you want to change a bit between other games, or when you are trying to show something new
- It can be perfectly played by casual gamers

CONS
- It is VERY easy to cheat without noticing during the first games, completely ruining them
- Requires a fair amount of memory, which can be frustrating for some people

This is a fun game that is probably even better than I think because I've not played all the expansions yet.  Love the suspense as everyones hitman is out to make kills quickly but not so quickly so they reveal themselves.  

My two complaints are that: 1) it takes awhile to set up the first round as the cutouts need to be put on stands.  This was meant to be a quick game and it's hard to get in the mood when setup takes longer than gameplay.  2) the cutouts are small and can only be seen from two sides which causes a lot of confusion for a 4 player game and players are sitting on 4 sides.

Although the theme is obviously killing each other it is a very lighthearted and fun game to play. The player's inference capability is tested as well as meticulous planning skills.

On top the wonderful artwork makes 10' to kill an overall enjoyable experience.

10' to scratch the deduction itch. Had a game where all my targets were in my LOS and everyone had partial infos on who I was so I won easily and another where of 6 possible suspects, 4 were known to the next player (his killer and all his targets) so he busted me out right away. Setup is random and deterministic, game can end in a minute or drag eternally if no one dares to kill.

First game left me without rating. I dont know if this is good or not. The first game (3) was not terrible exiting, but I dont know if it was us trying it out, or using the 2-police-rule or if the game is simply not for us. We also had trouble to memorize which characters were actually suspects - would the game improve with a clue-like cheat sheet? Or would it be "too serious" with that? Dont know man, dont know...

Work perfectly from 2 to 4 players. Enjoyable, Short multiple games. Perfect as well for beginner and confirmed seeking a little in between 2 big games

This French hidden-character deduction game plays quickly (as the title suggests - it plays in about 10 minutes). The design of this Kickstarter is unnecessarily quirky (I can only imagine that they have gone for humanoid animal figures in an attempt at sanitising the assassination theme) but that doesn't detract from this being a quick, enjoyable, easy-to-play game. This game is almost certainly best with 4 (or 5, if played with the expansions); rules say it plays with fewer, but it clearly won't play as well with just two.

RATING: 6.8
A lightweight but interesting game of trying to achieve hidden goals without giving your identity on the board away.
The logic puzzle that develops out of reading the signal of other player's actions from the noise of their cover ups is surprisingly engaging!
I didn't think I'd like this as much as I did.

Light deduction/stealth game. Requires players to have a good handle on the rules for eliminating their targets to avoid mistakes. Surprisingly easy to give your ID away if clumsy so I think careful play would be rewarded. As a short filler game, perfectly acceptable if unremarkable.

Edit - careful play turns it overlong. Rating reduced

I was disappointed by this - was expected a bit more fun deduction, but actually it was remarkably easy to work out the possibilities each time, and reduce them fairly rapidly.

Visually clogged, strange palette of colors and overall disagreeable aesthetic, To play well, you need to try and remember every possibility for every player in a quickly shifting situation, which is impossible or very annoying with 4. Everyone keeps forgetting rules, which are not intuitive, and all of this is terrible for a casual game. Several better games of deduction exist, this is the worst I have ever played.

RATING: N/A
Very, very fast and fun game. Beware, though, your first few games, someone WILL make a mistake. The game is fast enough that if it does happen, whatever, play another one.

Taught it to some people that generally don't play games and we ended up playing four times back-to-back. They loved it, asked to bring it with me when we go to visit them.

Light deduction filler. There are sixteen unique characters spread over a map of 16 tiles; each player is secretly assigned one as a hitman and three as targets. A turn consists of two actions, either to move any character to any other location, declare an assassination or to attempt an arrest with a policeman. Only a player's hitman can kill, and it must be either on the same tile (knife), adjacent (pistol) or have a sniper's vantage point on the same row/column. Guns can't be used on the same tile as any other character; neither guns nor knives can be used adjacent to the police. 

Obviously, the goal is to mask your own murders while manipulating the board to be unfavourable to opponents.

Mechanically it works quite well but I'm inclined to think that the point structure offers the wrong incentives. For example, a player earns 2 points if their hitman is left alive/free but only 1 point per target killed, so it's not the worst idea in the world to kill no-one and simply attempt arrests on other players. Likewise, killing an opponent's hitman is worth 3 points, so it's reasonable to decide that a wild guess for 3 points is the optimal choice. There are also advantages to both first player (first turn has a much easier board) and last (may be able to kill without repercussions).

All that said, it's a 10-15 minute filler, and not a big problem if played in the intended bloodthirsty spirit. I enjoy it as-is.

10' to Kill has some interesting ideas in it, but honestly, there's nothing in here that I don't already get in Rumble in the Dungeon, except in this you can relatively easily deduce who another player is within 1 or 2 kills. Also, it can easily drag on for a lot longer than needed.

Fun, little deduction game with a somewhat unique theme. Definitely don't play it 2 player as it slows down to become a chess game.

10' to kill is an easy filler. Lucky guess early in the game can still let you be a contender through hunting down the other. Lucky guess early in the game can finish the game just as easily. With two players it becomes a bit chessy, with more than four players it becomes chaos.

This is really a fun game,  lots of variable set up, good with all counts.  Yes there is a luck factor with initial set, but can play a lot of different ways based on how it unfolds,  and although you may think that very rarely does the first player win,  especially if you slow play around them.   Fun fun good game!!

This game is so much fun in such a small box.  It's pretty quick to teach and very accessible.  The one challenge is that it is very easy when learning to make mistakes and it is either very telling or can win you the game on "accident". Takes a good amount of self policing.

I think this is great - 5 players is too many though.


I actually think it's difficult to be deductive, but nonetheless is fun to play.  One of the better 'filler games' out there, for sure.

ok game, original concept but it fails in regard of it's title: it does not play in 10' (unless everyone just acts at random and don't pay attention...)

[+] any time you act you narrow the possibilities for your opponents to kill/catch you, but...
[-] ...if you act carrefully, the game takes much more than 10'

Though it is sometimes hard to identify crucial figures among the crowded board, deduction quickly becomes easier as characters are killed off. 
The art is brilliant, and the game plays quickly (though it takes more than 10 minutes).

I loved this little deduction game, components are good, and rules are quite simple, even though, you spend more time explaining than playing. It depends too much on the people you play with; I​ guessed the sniper of other players not by deduction but the player's face, behaviour.

Yaquinto original is a classic. Excalibur's reprint is a poor substitute.

RATING: 6
Somewhat disapointing. The infantry rules are too simple compared with the AFV rules. The low rates of fire (one shot actually represents several shells) seems too abstract given the heavy detail in other respects (what is the angle of fire, which target location is hit, what is the armor thickness of a particular location, etc.). The generic scenarios are very bland. Still, the game does a lot of things right. It's easy to see why it appeals to fans of tactical armored combat.

LOVE the Panzer/88/Armor system. I prefer plotted movement over the marker system in MBT/IDF and the newest iteration of Panzer. Modified MBT/IDF to use Panzer command sheets.

This was the apogee of miniatures armor versus armor in a boardgame format, at least for World War II.  We'll see what the GMT version does for the system; right now, all looks pretty positive.  The Yaquinto version was outstanding--moveable hills, woods, and buildings ensured the board could vary in more than just geomorphic ways.  Infantry certainly certainly took a distant back seat to the clash of tanks and anti-tank guns, but the clashes were dramatic and fun.  Hard for me to go back after playing ASL armor system, but with the right opponent and situation, I'd do it!

88, Panzer and Armor...my first real wargame system. I still like to play these after 20 some years.

Q: How much of your rating is nostalgia based?

A: I think that "very little" is the correct answer. Yes, it was a good time in my life when I was playing alot of this but I still enjoy it very much today.

Q: If not nostalgia then why do you like it so?

A: I have always enjoyed the concept of armored vehicle warfare ever since I was pushing around little green tanks and men on the living room floor. Yeah, I still do that but I meant in a nongame related way.

This series focuses on armored conflict in detail. The rest of the WWII battlefield components are present, however, they are either abstracted a bit or streamlined to keep the armor as the lead element.

I love the detail of this system, and the plotted moves add an element of fog-of-war that prevents the perfect moves that result from IGO-UGO rulesets.

The very detailed shot resolution system is a bit more complicated than it needs to be, but I guess I just like the chrome.

Another strength is the vast amount of equipment covered by the three titles in this system, and huge replayability due to the modular maps and terrain tiles.

The downside of all this is that I seem to like the game more than anyone I know, so I rarely get to play it.

collection includes Armor and 88, essentially the same game with different maps and different units.

A bit dry, more of a miniature's system than boardgame.

Panzer was everything we wanted the expanded Squad Leader system to be but wasn't - armor-oriented, with detailed unit characteristics, quick-playing, and with a super-flexible terrain system. Virtually every aspect of tactical WWII combat is covered in 24 pages of easy-to-understand rules. Those frustrated with Squad Leader/ASL should take a hard look at Panzer, along with its sister games '88' and Armor.

A wargame title that every wargamer wants...!  Panzer!

This could be said of ASL of tanks - tactical WW2 system and modular approach.  This is an in-depth study of the actual tanks' capabilities in the battleground with the tanks' datacards.  I look into the sequence of play and find it simple enough.  The initiative phase guarantees no two game would be the same in a particular scenario.  The advanced phases are not that complex on the description of the sequence of play and they seem to make sense.  The sequential nature of a turn and fire before movement both simplify the system without the sometimes confusing reactionay fire as found in ASL.  I definitely want to see more from this game, classic since 1979, a time before I got into wargaming.

Just bought the Yaquinto version, in fantastic condition for $29 on eBay. I actually owned one of the 'sister' games to this, as a kid - '88'. Based on my experience with 88, and my memory of the game play... what this game system does (tank battles) it does well. Very detail oriented game play, but not to the point that it really bogged down the game play. My brother and I always preferred the idea of owning 'Panzer', but never had the opportunity. All those heavy tanks! By comparison, '88' features much lighter and earlier tanks and vehicles. I can't wait to try playing Panzer with my brother.

RATING: 6.5
The game play in this single-vehicle / squad scale Eastern Front game is strongly reminiscent of that in tactical naval games such as Battleship Captain and Great War at Sea.  Fire involves table look-ups to determine hit/miss, then hit location, then armor penetration, then damage.  Jutland with tanks.  The pre-plotted simultaneous movement is also more typical of the tactical naval genre then of land combat games.  The combat look-ups are fast, logical and enlightening.  The pre-plotted movement, however, really limits you to small battles, say a platoon or two of armored vehicles and at most a company of infantry.  Combat is fairly lethal though, so the game soon speeds up.  

I didn't care much for the maps, nor the fact that they didn't fit in the box and so came out warped.  This wasn't a problem though since scenario creation is easy and the game can be played on any reasonably scaled maps.  I should have read up on the various editions and gotten one of the designer-approved ones.  That would have eliminated the map and font issues that bugged me.  In the end, I used the maps from Panzerblitz with good results.

I suspect the somewhat simplified GMT update will play faster and retain much of the feel.

The Basic tank/armour Rules are great.  The Advanced Rules fall flat - while many of the Advanced Rules are good, the infantry seem like an afterthought and have to be fixed.  If the infantry rules actually worked, I'd give this game an 8 or even a 9.  As it stands, I gave away my copy. Why play this when you can play ATS or ASL?

I really like the original edition better than the GMT edition. Plotted movement, geomorphic boards, simultaneous movement, it gives you a real miniatures feel to the game. The only thing is that the infantry rules are lacking.  ATS does this far better and the armor is cleaner with the right amount of detail.  Lowered rating since playing ATS and no longer play Panzer.

I asked for this for my Birthday one year when I saw it at Dufferin Game Room.  Little did I know.  This is an overly complex war game.  I never played it, or even punched out the chits.  I'd actually forgotten about it until I found it in a pile of my old stuff my mom was throwing away.
Anyone want it?

Second game of an ongoing series, concerning air combat in WW II called "FIGHTING WINGS"...
It's coming with a training scenario to get newbies into the system! 
Just look for the others:

I think of AS! as the Fighting Wings Rules version 1.1, with Over the Reich being version 1.0 and Whistling Death being v2.0. All scenarios and aircraft data cards found herein are compatible with the rules found in Whistling Death.

Finally got a chance to play this other than solo, at a recent Wargame convention. Excellent historical accuracy and very immersive. However, as it is more of a simulation than a 'game''; many fighter duels end in a draw. We did Spit 1 vs. ME109E. I won a 'moral' victory as I got a shot off (rolled poorly, so no damage). Otherwise we just flew against each other. Excellent simulation. Great game if you have the patience and interest. Oh yeah. It's also pretty hard game to learn.

How can anyone say no to Spitfires? The ruleset is more mature than Over the Reich, but vertical movement rules would finally be fixed in Whistling Death.

RATING: 7
My first game with the Fighting Wings QuickStart rules is luring me in. It's a lot simpler than it looks when you read the rules for the first time, and the main complexity comes from having to envision the 3D movement and energy changes.

I'm very impressed with how the game copes with the 3D aspect; very effective indeed.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Be sure to start out using the free Quick-Start rules.

Some of the comments along the lines of "unnecessarily complicated" are born of ignorance. Air combat IS complicated. If you just want a fun game with an airplane theme, AS! and the rest of the Fighting Wings games are not for you. If you actually want to LEARN something about the factors that make one fighter better than another, you need something with at least the detail of AS!

That said, while AS! makes great strides in its representation of three-dimensional movement, it does so in a very math-heavy way. The rules become a mass of exceptions and special rules, leaving it difficult to make even a simple move without an error. There are more elegant designs on the horizon, derived from the Birds of Prey 3D engine.

If you love WWII air combat, your collection is not complete without this game. I hate the mass of exceptions and special rules, but I love (LOVE!) the period flavor and the chrome. Beautiful counters as well.

This and the other games in the FIGHTING WINGS series of World War II combat games are the ASL of the air-to-air combat genre (and air-to-ground combat is pretty good too).  Like ASL, it may be too complicated for some.  Others will want to play flight simulators on PCs, especially networked with other players, instead of this.  But this series positively shines and is great fun for clubs and multi-player sessions, provided players are willing to put in the work to learn the system and practice flying their aircraft (to say nothing of fighting it!).

initial rating, more planes and counters for the whistling death ruleset.

rating is a recent downgrade of all complicated air combat games.  I have had an epiphany that for all the mental overhead, they just aren't that fun to play and it is too difficult to find opponents.  Many of the games just end up being indecisive turn-fests, or won by a lucky shot/initiative die-roll.

Second opus of FW serie, a good game but the spitfire is REALY BETTER THAN the 109, so if you want to learn the rules, try to take other aircrafts for your first fight. Compatible with OTR and WD.

I designed it in mid 1990s, my second WW2 effort after jet games.  Great attention to detail on aircraft relative performance and firepower.  The system meant to one-up and improve state of art over BL's Air Force system. I used sequential moves other nuances.  Flight mechanics have some rough edges compared to latest generation of this system.  I give myself a B+ for effort, minor improvements in system over first release Over the Reich.  Note that data cards and scenarios remain compatible with newest edition rules found in Whistling Death.

I greatly enjoy the FW series of games. I only rate this slightly lower then Whistling Death for the older rules therein.
I enjoy the early war scenarios (and planes here) most of all of the games.
Would love to see more early scenarios and the missions updated to the WD level

A game in the Fighting Wings series.  Latest series rules are in Whistling Death, no living rules on-line.

The Fighting Wings games are very detailed, and thus, very complex simulations of aerial combat in WWII.  It takes a lot of time to manevuer aircraft into position to attack, and that doesn't happen very often.  It takes hours to simulate a few seconds of real time.

Game finally acquired due to futile resistance of special sales from the publisher as a result of Buffalo Wing being well received by ATO magazine subscribers.  Detailed flight combats.  Realism, yes.  Heard good things about this series games.  They are good in simulating the aerodynamics in a 3D environment.  Sometimes they could be abstract though.  Depends on your taste, this one could be a make or break.  For flight combat grognard, for sure.

Air Superiority goes Propeller and WW2. This later game focuses on the early war, with the battle of britain and french campaign. 

If you want to play the Fighting Wings series of games, make sure you get the latest edition of the rules (Whistling Death), vertical maneuvering isn't the same without it.

Essentially identical to Over the Reich except for the inclusion of early-war RAF and Luftwaffe aircraft.  Personally, I was disappointed that no French or Polish a/c were included in the mix, but the fact I was able to game dogfights from the Battle of Britain (a favorite historical period of mine) made up for it.

I've played this game system (Fighting Wings) more over its lifetime than anything else.  I love the granularity in distinguishing aircraft and that the game does a good job of giving a feel for the tactics and flying within the confines of a fun game.

There are a ton of aircraft data cards and scenarios.  A huge amount of play value.

Because they're all the same system (though the base system has been refined over the years, I play all of them with the latest rules and there is full backward compatibility in the games), I have the same comments for Over the Reich, Achtung Spitfire! and Whistling Death.

Excellent simulation of WWII aerial combat. Rules are difficult to master due to the amount of details. Should be played with a more recent version of the rules (Whistling Death or Wings of the Motherland). Too bad Clash or arms doesn't sell an upgrade package.

Fighting Wings is a fun system, it seems complicated at first, but once you get the hang of the sheets it's not too tough.  You need to plan ahead and think like a real pilot, and know the limitations of your aircraft. Looking forward to the Eastern Front module.

Just learning these complex rules. It's very difficult finding someone/anyone who wants to work through learning this enticing game. I find these are the rules I will be using, foregoing the hyper-complex 2.0 rules found in Whistling Death.

With approximately equal A/C, initiative is all important. Lose it and move so that a neutral position is assured. Gain it and move into a more advantaged position.


(OK, I'm trying to give WD another go.)

I enjoy this one with the early war planes. Just get Whistling Death for the current version of the rules. (I'd rate this one a 10 if it had the WD rules).

Great game and system. System has since been improved further with Whistling Death, but still excellent nonetheless. Lots of replayability thanks to large number of scenarios and tactical grid to set up your own scenarios. Also, JD, has clearly put an immense amount of effort and love into this system as evidenced by the massive amount of technical detail included.
Always happy to play scenarios from this system.

Used with the Whistling Death ruleset, this game is AMAZING!  The Fighting Wings series  is easily the best air combat game I have ever played.  The Quick start rules will get you started quick, although I recommend playing in a PBeM first since the experienced moderators can help you out with questions concerning the initially difficult to grasp rules.  But once it clicks...oh man!  I am hooked on this.

RATING: N/A
Tried to learn solo but didn't get too far.  Now I am learning the system under the expert eye of the designer J D Webster via the Fighting Wings Group on Yahoo (a highly recommended approach).  
This system appeals to me as I can see on the map where I would like to get my aircraft and then its a case of "flying" as close as I can get.  Turns get much faster with practise allowing you to concentrate on the bigger picture.  Aircraft differences make for real world tactics.  Looking forward to trying the operational game (a whole mission from take-off to landing).

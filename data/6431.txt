Finally getting an extended run on this. Still using the basic game rules - I have a feeling this will rise when I get to the advanced scenarios. Excellent feel, rules that aren't difficult to comprehend, but to know how to play the game, and playing the game well are 2 different things!

I playtested an early version of this game. One of the better Nato vs Pact games. I really like the map, but the counters are average fare. I would have preferred silhouettes on my tank and AFV units. I had a lot of fun playing this one.

Good reviews on this NATO vs WARSAW PACT game. Russians come in a frightening array of pinks, oranges and yellows. Has a nuclear option along the lines of...roll d6..on a 1, you win, 2-6 you lose.

War game from West End Games golden period. 

Like the Tank Leader series from the same company, it focuses on the C3 aspects of the battlefield instead of hardware. Very interested in trying this out in the near future.

RATING: 6
Detailed game covering an attack on West German and American mechanized forces in the Schweinfurt area by the 8th Guards Army. A surprising amount of chrome is packed into the game and almost every battle features the ground, artillery, air, and EW assets.

I've played twice and much of the time you're trying to engage the heaviest enemy forces with as much artillery and air support as you can muster while keep contact with the enemy using the smallest possible units.

Command points are spent to maneuver units and engage in battles. This is critical as one can't do everything one wants to do. And once a force "shatters" it will be all you can do to keep them moving to form a new line of defense.

Even with experience, it will take 45-60 minutes to get through a full turn, so be prepared to sock away a full day or a long weekend of gaming to get through the full campaign game.

I just read the standard rules. Individually, the rules are simple, but add up to some serious mechanical complexity, and that's before you add in the advanced rules.

Played this back in the late 80s when I was very much into
contemporary (then) military operations as a senior Captain and then Major in Armor in the US Army.  It is the finest commercial simulation of contemporary operational combat operations I have ever encountered.  Not only that, but a cracking good game, too--I played lots of simulations in the Army, but those were NOT fun.

RATING: 8
One of the best games in demonstrating the complexities of operational-level warfare in NATO's defense of West Germany in the 1980s.  It may be too much for many players.  High levels of fog of war, very different command and control situations for both sides, electronic warfare, and much more.  Few other games model the military challenges at this scale; of those that do (FIFTH CORPS, HOF GAP), this one is overall the best.

This is an excellent wwiii game from west end.  The game centers around the doctrinal differences between Warsaw Pact and NATO forces.  Excellent command-control rules force players to plan carefully because once the two forces come to blows, things can spiral out of control.  I also like the way the air war is played out.  It's abstracted more than in Tac Air (similar game, similar scale) which speeds up game play considerably, but it's not so abstract that the players don't need to plan for and defend against air strikes.  Overall, this is a great game!

RATING: 8
I found the system to by intuitive and easy to understand. The empahisis is on limited intelligence and C2 factors. The game play is very realistic and tense, both sides are in the game, with constant decisions etc. I agree that that the air part needs more work. For example the killer american helios can hunt down and kill most of the Soviet artillery early in the game.

I don't have much to add to the comments from the honourable member from north London.  The rotary-wing assets do break a couple scenarios, but you can patch that easily enough with some house rules.  The charms far outweight the shortfalls - one of a handful of games of the era that continue to shine to this day.

I really want to like it, but the rules are extremely cumbersome. You are in danger of committing a mistake virtually any time you want to do something, even if it is a simple movement. The result was that both of my opponents with whom I tried to play gave up already after the first turn. 

Maybe there is someone who knows the rules really well and would like to give it a try pbm?

Air & Armor has many traits you will find familiar, but the many tweaks do impart a flavor unique to this game. In particular, I like the hidden strengths of the battalions and the overall fluidity of the engagements. Also, there are many scenarios adding to replayability. And I like most things 'Pact vs NATO. Admittedly, the map is a bit of an eyesore, though very functional. You can get this cheap, and well worth it!

Have only just browsed the rules; but it looks really interesting.

The variable (and secret) unit strength it a very interesting bit, but seems fiddly. Might the same effect be accomplished by the use of home made blocks?

Seems to do a great job at simulating C3I issues and the difference in doctrine in the war that never was.

Air & Armor (mostly armor) focuses on the NATO / Warsaw Pact command and control differences and their impact on corps-sized battles.  It distinguishes between Assault (little movement, but lots of support), Hasty Attack (more movement, less support) and Movement (road movement, no attacks) missions.  Air, gunship, and artillery support and strikes are also featured, but air support is by no means as dominant as the name suggests.  The terse rules of exceptional clarity are backed up with carefully crafted examples and well thought out player aid folders.  The game comes in two forms: Standard, which is basically WW III in a WW II eastern front environment (no air, helos, chemical or electronic warfare); and Advanced which is definitely WW III.  The Advanced game isn't that much more complex than the Standard game, but the modern technology lends it a whole different feel.  Scenarios play out about like one would expect from reading about the era.  Defensive fire is brutal, so artillery and gunship support can make a big difference in the success of an attack.  Numbers alone will win you a battle, but not the game, as the attacker frequently suffers greater losses than the defender, even in high odds attacks.  The bloody CRT is in keeping with the lethality of modern combat.

Despite the roughly battalion sized pieces (actually task forces / kampf groups) combat is fire based rather than odds based, in keeping with the game's grand tactical rather than operational flavor.  Defense strength does impact losses, but the effect based on armor and concealment of individual units not defensive fire power, again a grand tactical rather than operational approach.  The overall use of terrain is simple, but more sophisticated than in many grand tactical games. 

The pieces are great, with extensive use of color coding to denote the command hierarchy and use/unused status.  The map is likewise beautiful and easy on they eyes.  The otherwise great player aid charts come as pullouts in the center of the rules booklets.  They would hold up better if copied to card stock. The same is true of the three plain paper displays.

Solo play works well.  This is a game you can really learn from.

A stern and unforgiving game system that knows what it wants from its players and does not suffer fools gladly. It's an impressive design, if all a little joyless. The limited intelligence mechanics are surprisingly generic given the extent to which the designer's notes tout them as the heart and soul of the game.

Excellent game system, really unlike anything out there that I've played at the operational level.  If anything, some of the game mechanics remind me of Columbia Games EastFront (!).  Any wargamer interested in a portrayal of modern warfare (circa 1980's) should at least try the system.

The rules cover a wide range of elements (Electronic Warfare, Air Support, Helos, Airmobile Units, Chemical Warfare, Combat Engineering, Fog of War, and so on), but the systems and procedures remain very playable.  Much better (both as a game and simulation) than contemporary and current wargame designs that cover the same topic that I'm aware of.

Outstanding - highly recommended operational level WW3 game.  Components are simple, but very solid.  Map is well done, counters are NATO icons covering US, Soviet, East & West German, and Canadian forces, and the rules are well laid out and understandable.  Unit strength is managed by strength chits (a counter could represent 1 company or an entire battalion) which adds nicely to the fog of war.  Command and control is managed by a # of command points assigned to Headquarters units - the differential being that NATO has brigade and divisional HQs while the WP has only divisional HQs (main and forward HQs) giving NATO a slight advantage in action and most importantly, reaction.  Additionally WP units must decide what mission (assault, movement, hasty assault, reserve) they will undertake for the turn prior to the turn starting (each mission has unique capabilities assigned to it).  Terrain also plays an important role - more so than just DRM modifiers - as it increases the defensive ability of units and / or reduces the firepower of units firing from and into restrictive terrain.  Overall the system will punish a player who attacks without trying to use movement to uncover the enemy or defend without reserves.  I recommend using the Advanced Rules which are pretty simple to understand and use, and definitely add to the realism of the game.  My only complaint (and it's a matter of personal opinion) is that US infantry units appear defensively weak compared to other NATO and WP units of relative strength / equipment.

RATING: 10
A superb game. A real designer's design, full of insight and neat touches. A&A is one of those many-layered rarities in which you learn a new subtlety each time you play it. The fog of war works well and the units are nicely delineated, with tanks severely disadvantaged in close terrain and infantry useful in urban and forested areas. Armoured cavalry functions according to doctrine, and Engineers become vital assets rather than cheap infantry support. If there's a complaint it's that the air part of Air & Armor is poorly done. The US has overrated AH-64s that can be massed to smash enemy formations. If the helo rules could be given an overhaul to reflect realistic availability and doctrine, the game would be a perfect '10'. (UPDATE: I have overhauled the helo rules and have a house rules module I am working the nits out of. This improves my game rating from '9' to '10'.)

Well.. you have to play it to appreciate how clean, balanced and enjoyable this game is.  A very well thought out C&C method.  And the game appears 'realistic' without undue complexity.  Low counter density, slightly fiddly with step counters and the need to 'flip' for activitation, but small fry compared to other games, eg ASL.  Two levels of play; Advanced adds EMC, Gas, etc. Most of important ENJOYABLE.

RATING: 6
The system is very sharp for a relatively old game. The emphasis is away from combat detail and more on the different command-control doctrines and some limited intelligence. The first scenario is about proper positioning to channel enemy moves; I would prefer something a little meatier. I am not much of a fan of hex-and-counter anymore, but Air & Armor is not like other girls. My "To Play" pile is very tall, but I might circle back to this one sooner than later.

RATING: 9
This is probably the best WWIII game ever done. It's a superb system. My only real complaint is that it's not very extensible beyond the specific forces and situations portrayed. But as a self-contained game, it truly is the best thing out there for what it's trying to accomplish.

I finally found a copy of this one cheap at a local auction and am really excited about getting it to the table. A&A is a fascinating design - all the usual wargame mechanics (combat, movement, terrain, etc.) are simplified and subordinated to a very subtle and detailed system for command and control. I dabbled a bit with the first scenario solo just to learn the rules, but there's way too much hidden information in this one to pass any judgment based on solo play.

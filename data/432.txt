As a party game the rating is 8. As a general game rating is 6. Overall rating is 7.

A fine game. Plays well. Requires some choices. But depends on luck as well. An excellent filler but nothing more to me.

You need at least 3 players to make this game work, but it is a very good (and easy!) card game to play. It is non-threatening to non-gamers, but it can be mean as you understand good and bad plays. There's certainly strategy in how you play out your hand of cards. Over all, fine game for everyone!

Fun and light for all audiences. Plays well with all numbers of players.

2016-04-11
The best thing about 6 nimmt! is that it comes in a small package, can be taught in 3 minutes and scales well to different number of players. 

I think that the sweetspot regarding control vs. fun is with 4-6 players. With more players the game is still very fun but the increased amount of chaos makes players' own choices less relevant. You can still do rather well by playing cards at random, although not always. 

With 2-3 players the game is still playable, but I think that there is not enough tension since there might be huge gaps in numbers which are in play. For me the best part of the game is in agonising whether you could play that 5th card onto a row or not. But the game is still playable.

6 nimmt! is a good game regardless of the player numbers. It does not offer a code to crack or very deep analyses, only fun.

A good, fun card game which reminded me slightly of Hearts in that you try not to win points and try to put those points on others if you can.  

The rules are simple and it makes a great starter or end to a night of gaming.  

Just how much control there is over tactical play I am not sure about.  There are certainly tactics, but I think the element of luck is large, too.  There is certainly not as much control in planning how you play your hand as there is in Hearts, and it is more difficult to target a player as what happens on the lines of 6 can be much more random than each trick in Hearts.

Great little game for up to 10 players, but I've never played with more than 6 and it's fun, a bit chaotic, but a somewhat manageable (if that is possible:)) chaos . You play cards that fit on one of the 4 bases/lines, if yours is the sixth card you take the line leaving your card behind to form a new base. the person with the most card points at he end. LOSES! Great fun.

This is a popular game, but at least my edition had some unclear rules and poor graphic design choices that detracted from the game. I'd be willing to play with a different group -- one that knows exactly how to interpret the ambiguous rule. I'd also rather play with a different edition of the game; one where the graphic design advances the game play instead of whatever it was trying to accomplish on this edition.

My family loves this game, and in my mind, it's always been light, fun, filler.  However, I tried the advanced rules (removing cards depending on the number of players so that all cards are in play), and things started to click.  I like it a lot more now.  Sure, it's still a fairly random game, but using the limited deck adds several more tactical and strategic options to the table.  I will have to play it this way more often.

such a great group card game. Great for winding down a night. The best players tend to always win, but the chaos always keeps things interesting. Greatly enjoy the joker variant (it is included in the deal every time, and sits in front of whomever has it. Its worth -10 points as long as you have at least one trick, otherwise it's worth +10 points. When you take a trick, pass it to the person on your left).

Played for 1st time, game of 5 rounds with 6 players. Easy-to-grasp concept, playable with a bigger group, not too much luck involved I guess, gives the player control over his turn. Sure, a lot of high cards arent favorable, but even then you can do your best to avoid the minus points. Mental maths is always a good thing. I like that you can roughly forsee where your next card will be.

With 4-6 players I'd prefer Citadels though.

I'm always surprised by good or bad reactions to this game.  I haven't put my finger on what makes a non-gamer like or dislike it.  Very decent.  Good utility game for demoing other number-based card games too.  Played it recently after a long delay, forgot about how quick and playable it was.  Should be more of a go-to filler for me.  Four rows, higher numbers than the board get placed to the closest match, lower numbers than the board eat a row, score pips against you, play to 72.  Simple!

RATING: 7
A fun, very light game. It almost feels like a party game, but the variant can be played for a rather tactical game.

UPDATE: The tactical option doesn't make a good tactical game. However, the party game is much better than what I initially thought!

UPDATE: The chaos is still great, but there are better games for 7-10 players. Down to a 7.

{2P: 6, 3P: 6, 4P: 7, 5P: 8, 6P: 8, 7P: 8, 8P: 7, 9P: 7, 10P: 6}

[i]6 Nimmt![/i] is another game which I originally learned on [url=http://www.brettspielwelt.de/?nation=en]BSW[/url], and had played many times before acquiring a copy (other such games include [i][thing=15512]Diamant[/thing][/i], [i][thing=17240]Verflixxt![/thing][/i], and [i][thing=15818]Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck[/thing][/i]).  As such, I was sentimentally attached to the bulls from the German version of the game, as well as saying "Moooo!" whenever a player has to take a row of cards.  More on that in a bit.

The game is very straightforward: each player starts with 10 cards in her hand.  The goal of each hand is to play all of your cards without taking any points in the process.  There are four rows of cards laid out on the table, in ascending order.  Each row can have up to five cards in it.  If the card you want to play will be the sixth card in the row, then you have to take the previous five cards and say "Moooo!" (it's not an actual rule, but you should do so anyway).  Each of those cards you just took has a number of bull icons on it.  Your card is then played as the first in a new row.  Your score for the round is the total number of bull icons on the cards you collected.

The rules are simple enough, and tell you how to arrange the cards.  The frustrating part about this game is when you think you can squeeze a card in under the limit for a particular row, but when everyone reveals their cards, that row fills up before your card is played and you end up having to say "Moooo!"  The game is exhilarating when you've resigned yourself to clearing a row in order to play a low card from your hand, and then another player plays a lower one.

With more players, the likelihood that these events occur with greater frequency increases: every card is in play.  The game becomes chaotic, as rows will almost certainly shift before all the cards are played.  With just a couple of players, the game becomes more strategic, but also less certain: very few cards will be in play.  Can you fill a row to the brim, or does your opponent have a card that she can sneak in ahead of you?  I find that while the game accommodates a wide number of players, its sweet spot is in the 5 - 7 player range.

[i]6 Nimmt![/i] is a compact game which travels well.  I specifically sought out the [i]Jubiläumsedition[/i] for its tin, although its rarity makes me reluctant to actually play the game.  It can scale if needed, and is easily taught.  That makes it a platoon player which can support just about any collection.  Moooo!

Its an anti-trick variant card game and I really don't like many card games.

Second play and I just cant see a game with any meaningful decisions. It just seems to be a huge lottery. Rating reduced to 4. I really don't want to play again.

Ten years later and I find myself at a table looking for an end of evening filler. This appears and I have forgotten all about it except I seem to have played it before. Suddenly the memories of the chaos come flooding back. Some people are dealt extremely dire cards, some get useful combos. It is a frustrating random experience that I am compelled to crank down from a 4 to a rating of 2. I really don't want to ever play this again.

When I first played it 2 player, I absolutely did not understand the nuances, and still don't.  When played with 3 or more, the game TOTALLY changes into something wildly fun!

Yes, this is sort of a cheat as I used to own the Slide 5 version of this and played it multiple times before trading it away. However, BGG has it listed separately so I will count it that way. We played 7 player with only Flo & I knowing the game. Everyone caught on pretty quick with one of the newbies (Ilene) winning after 5 rounds. The chaos factor obviously goes up with more players, but so does the fun factor. There lots of ooohs and ahhs as someone would get lucky and not take cards when they thought they would. Expect to see many more plays of this going forward as Flo is a big fan of this one.

Very portable, and it's easy to get plenty of people involved, since it's such a simple yet tense game!

These days it's been supplanted by Coloretto.

With only 3-4 players it is way too predictable and there's not much fun.
Need many players to start giving some challenge.

Good game for family and people who usually don't play board games.

RATING: 6
This is a fun, very light card game which handles a large number of players.  It's a guessing game which combines tactical decisions with a good bit of gut instinct.  I'd imagine with a large number of plays you could be significantly better than a new player, but it's not terribly deep.  Should be fun for young and old players alike.

I like this. You've gotta play to the middle, the third and fourth cards, but fear the fifth and sixth. Don't be afraid to play low card and take a small row.

Last time I played this, everything just clicked. I finally "get" it. I think.

RATING: 6
This game of simultaneous decision-making is crazy fun.  I like trying to read my opponents' minds and guessing their plans.  It gets more random with more players, but that just makes it more enjoyable for me.  It's always interesting trying to predict if another player will play lower than you, so that you can force them to take the points, allowing you to get away with taking none.  It's definitely a game where the best-laid plans will fall apart.

Some players will really not enjoy the unpredictability of the game, because knowing what will happen is very hard, but this is not intended to be some deep game.  In fact some people might get stuck with so many cards that they will complain about the game being too luck-driven and the players have no control.  However we have played with a random player in the mix and that player always performs much worse than a selective player.  So there is a strategy somewhere in this game, it's just not that obvious and not 100% effective.

There's some strategy, but (especially in 8-10 player games) in the end this game is more about watching what happens after each turn than it is about winning. It tends to amuse large groups, and it plays in a predictable amount of time, but there's just not that much there underneath everybody's amused groans of "my hand sucks."

RATING: 6
There is some very basic strategy here of risk vs reward but this is a little too random for me; and not a fun random like Diamant.  It's main appeal is that it's playable with a lot of people, easy to explain, and plays quickly.  Beyond fitting that niche the game itself isn't that fun.  The problem is, there is a lot of competition for games that fit that niche, and I just have so many games that I'd rather play instead of it.

The worst thing about this game is trying to get people to play it for the first time...from there on in,it's all gravy. The simultaneous play keeps things going quickly, and the uncertainty factor keeps the tension high. Strangely addictive, and very approachable for noobs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Okay game. Luck dependent, but on the bright side, skill still play a part. Luck increases with number of players.

Limited strategies - keep a balanced hand with low and high value cards and using them appropriately. 

- Low cards come handy when volunteering to take a row of cards, while high card is handy in sabotaging your opponents. 
- Sometimes one has to play a high card for his subsequent card to be a "low" card when a particular row is almost full. 
- On other occasions, it is important to play continuously numbered cards. 
- Important to time when to play a "similar-number" card, and sometimes to gamble and play a "higher-number" card.

Same game as Slide 5 (which I own).  While I didn't like Slide 5 but enjoyed my plays of Category 5, I can see that it has everything to do with the group.  With players who are into it, it can be a bit more tense as everyone tries to set up for success (and avoid taking rows).  Not great, but decent.

I played this game once at a convention with 8 people.  I hated it.  I like light games, but this was practically a no game.  Only about 1 in 8 turns does it even matter what card you play.  The other 7 in 8, you might as well pull a card randomly from your hand and toss it out there.  Boooooring.

Simple and good fun, with a great press-your-luck element. Plays quickly.  Works with 2, but clearly better with more.  For 2 (or 3), the variant that doesn't recycle the cards left on the table when the players play their 10th card works quite well.

Extremely chaotic, especially with more than 3 players. There is a strategy which improves your chances to the point where you can beat a newbie the first couple of games. However, among players who have mastered the basics, even the best player needs a fair slice of luck to do well.

RATING: 6
One of the oldest and most known fillers that are still played today, 6 nimmt (or Category 5, as the English title goes) is a great party game: since players put their chosen card into play simultaneously, each turn’s outcome is unpredictable overall, even though some assumptions can be made in order to play more safely. A nice and light game overall.

Fun game, great for practically any-sized group.  Very hard to nail down a winning strategy, which makes you want to play again and again.  Before you find a strategy, though, it feels pretty random, so give it a few plays before making up your mind about it.

I could actually use this as a test to see how fun a player is to game with.  If I meet someone who says they HATE this game (and I have only met one so far, a hard-core gamer), that tells me I won't enjoy playing any games with this person and will find another table.

RATING: 7
This is a great light game. At first it seems that it's very luck dependent until you see that the same one or two people keep winning the rounds. After a while you start to know what cards to play when and it's always fun to see other players take the row of huge points right before you do so that you then end up not getting any (which is a good thing in this game). This is a great filler that can be played with just one round or as long as you want. Very easy to teach and just enough strategy to keep things interesting throughout.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very accessible game.  Doesn't offer a lot for strategy, but it works well with non-gamers.  Too chaotic for my tastes.  Check out Hornochsen or Tanz der Hornochsen for more strategic versions of this game.

Finally tried the PROFI variant after 24 plays of base game.  It's an interesting variant.  At times it is very chaotic, but with the TACTIC variant used at the same time it wasn't too bad.  Most chaotic point is when someone undercuts you by a small margin, taking "your spot", and then your card gets sent somewhere totally unexpected.

A clever card game which does not take too long to play.

You don't really know what's coming next, so trying to second guess your opponents play can help, although you all get random cards and there are a bunch of cards missing each round, which adds a lot of risk!

A decent livener...

This is a quite simple card game, and I was sceptical initially. However, this is a surprisingly entertaining game with hidden depths. As in all (?) card games, luck is a factor, but much less significant than it may seem at first. Splendid replaybility and very addictive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a game that plays very differently depending on player count and what cards are intended.  

It plays with up to 10 players and cards from 1 to 104.  If played with all of the cards (regardless of the player count), this is lighthearted "fun".  I personally detested it this way and rated it either a 3 or a 2, I can't recall.  

OTOH, you can only include cards equal to 4 + 10 * (# of players), e.g., with 3 players, use 34 cards (1:34), with 4 players, use 44 (1:44).  I've also played a 2-player variant where 24 cards drawn from 1:30 are used.  Played this way, I quite like it, particular with 2 - 4 (5?) players.  It's still lighthearted fun, but there's some control over the chaos.  Played this way, I rate it an 8 and consider it one of Kramer's best games.

Good fun when in the mood, one of the few non-party games my mum has enjoyed too, which makes it a welcome addition to my collection at Christmas time. Fun filler for gamers and a fun demonstration of the hobby to newcomers.

De este juego me costó cogerle el truco (hasta no hacer una partida completa siguiendo fielmente las normas), pero para jugar con un grupo de 4 o 5 es entretenido. Unas cartas, un poco de caos y ya tenemos listo un filler para jugar. Es un juego de acción simultánea y ver cuanto estás dispuesto a arriesgar.

Mensa Club's most favorurite game, 6 Nimmt! is an excellent example of how a mathematical game could be engaging and well structured. Rules requires a little to get used to, but when all the players get acquinted with the game the real fun comes out. Really good.

1/18/05 - 6 times played. Super fun and a great filler and not as light as some may say. Everyone participates simultaneously - sometimes your card selection is obvious and a no-brainer. It's the times when you are too far away from current numbers showing which brings tension to the gameplay. Everyone we have played this with...love it!

RATING: 8
Challenging! Not sure I have figure out a strategy but it provides plenty of tension and a quick game. Seems to be a bit Lost Cities-like in that there is seldom a great move available but often "I hope this card isn't too bad". I know one player to claims to "know the strategy" but it is still a mystery to me.

RATING: 8
Easy to play, very easy to teach.  Strategy to this game is something of a monster...  more power to those that always win this one.  Good times, pretty dry though.  Most groups can't stand more than a few games of this.  Solid filler.

RATING: 6
A good game that plays up to 10.  It's fairly simple (but people still get confused on where to place their card…"least difference").  I'm not sure how much control you really have though.  Still…it's fun.

We have only played this with two players so far and it is a blast. Lots of tactics with two, and I'm sure it would be a great game, and different with more. I have played this multiplayer a fair maoutn now and it is equally fun with more, though less tactical.

RATING: 7.5
I own the German version, "6 nimmt!".

This game might be the ultimate filler.  Simple to teach, easy to play.  A hand takes 10 seconds, and each one offers a strategic decision.  And nearly every hand offers a big surprise that gets people shouting.  Delightful!  

That said, it's light enough that it's certainly possible to overplay it.  Also, games can drag on a bit if the scores are pretty evenly distributed.  For that reason, we now house rule it to "exactly 3 rounds" instead of "play until someone hits 66 points".  The game usually ends in 3-4 rounds anyway, and the game really starts to drag in that 4th round.

A classic and very different from nearly anything else - a good example of the width of Kramer's work.  Great wee game for provoking that 'oh no' feeling pretty much every round.  Scope for some clever play if you only use the first (4 + 10 X the number of players) cards variant. Sold only because of the 'fonty' box and because you can easily play this with the cards from Hornochsen. Played again for the first time in ages and it's still fresh as a daisy - rating up another notch; anything still as good 20 years on deserves it.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Good light-weight game that is easy to teach, fast to set-up, fast to play and that can accommodate a lot of players, even casual players.
++ BONUS: We can easily play the cooperative card game The Game with a 6 nimmt! deck, by using the 1 and 2 and the 101 and 102 cards as the starting stacks and the 103 and 104 cards within sleeves that are marked with an upward arrow and a downward arrow on the backside (to act as a remainder for the player of the increasing and decreasing stacks).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Too lightweight for the two of us, but it's still a good family "party game" that we enjoy from time to time with non-gamer friends.
-- Not a good 2-players game, so I cannot play this game often at home with my wife (although she would probably ask for something else anyway).

I'm having a difficult time determining if the level of strategy for this game is higher or lower than what it first appears to be.  It seems that playing intelligently will often put you in the running for a win, but you can't always count on that.

I haven't played using the variant number of cards based on number of players, but I imagine that could turn this light breezy filler into a hardcore memory mangler.

RATING: 6
Good for wasting a little time, but nothing too exciting  Fun when I'm in the mood to play, though.

I'm generally not a huge fan of simultaneous selection, but Category 5 (6 Nimmt) is light enough where the tense moment of the card flip is really what makes this entire game.  It also makes (almost) no play a 100% sure thing.

Interesting little card game that changes dramatically depending on the number of players.  It can get a bit heady but it's a rules light game.  Seems much to explore.  

At the same time, it's of course an abstract card game meaning it's not my regular cup of tea.  I don't think this is one I will be pulling out often, but I'm glad to have it on my shelf to provide something different than the norm.

This game imparts a fantastic sense of dread when the stakes are high, the columns are quite full, and I just know, I mean, I just know, I'm going to be picking up something. Choosing the poisonous card from my hand... it's rough.

On the other hand, I always enjoy laying down a card and hoping against odds that someone played something lower than me and will pick up instead. While I am filled with dread, it is because there is that hope. I don't fully resign myself to the bad outcome, I can always hope that someone is in bigger trouble than me.

There's also a great schadenfreude thrill watching others pick up. Particularly when you pick up that tiny pile that someone thought they were going to safely play on and they are forced now to pick up a huge column with plenty of juicy points in it.

Now, often when we think of emotional roller-coaster, we think of a luck fuelled game. There is certainly luck to this game. It's a card game. However, there is a strong element of hand evaluation, and how you should play out your cards, in order to get a specific end game hand. With what a good end game hand looks like varying by player count. The other influence on your decision as to which card to play is your evaluation of your fellow players.. Are the other players cowards? If yes, you might be able to sneak in a card that risks netting you big points. If they are risk takers, then you might be able to safely play on top of them once one of them takes the big column.

That being said, this is not a game for two to ten players. More like from four to eight. Too few, and picking up columns happens far too rarely. And picking up columns and the fear of, are what make the game fun. Too many and one's ability to predict the impact of the choices of the other players diminishes to the point where playing cowardly is the only way to go. It diminishes the range of viable options, and often, the results of one's decisions will feel like luck, not good play.

RATING: 7
This was one of the quintessential fillers when I got into the hobby, though it seems like it's fallen by the wayside a bit lately. That makes me a little sad. I played this for the first time in years recently and was almost surprised at how well it holds up.

This game is just brimming with tension and drama. More than even most dice games. Sure, the tension mostly comes in the form of hoping you get lucky... or, rather, hoping you don't get UNlucky, but since the game is played over multiple rounds it actually ends up feeling pretty fair. This might be one of the best pure "Here is your hand, try to make the best of it and hope it all pans out" games in existence.

There's also a ton of fun player psychology stuff that comes up, which is remarkable for something that isn't a bluffing game. The whole game revolves around trying to get other players to make moves that set yourself up for safe plays and again, yeah, a lot of this is based on luck of the draw for everyone at the table but damn if it isn't engaging.

It's probably a little long for a "filler" these days, which maybe explains its disappearance from the gaming radar, but if I'm in the mood for a 20-30 minute light game, I've got no qualms with busting this one out. It's just plain fun.

And on a final note... I don't know who they were thought they were fooling with 2-10 players. Any more than 4 and this game is just miserably chaotic. 2-4 is perfect: there's some semblance of control but really, you're always in danger.

Great "starter" card game. 

Fast, fun, and always keeps you guessing.

One way to spice up the game is to include all 104 cards in play instead of taking the amount of cards equal to how many are playing (i.e. 4 players = only play with cards 44 and lower, just use all cards and set deck aside after everyone has received their cards. This will keep rows flowing.

Somehow I just cannot grasp the simple strategy of this game! I've played it with player counts varying from 2-5 players, and most worked quite well. I would image it would be even more chaotic with more players, but also more fun than the rather "math-y" game it is with 2 players where you can outthink and outsmart the other player by clever play. However, unfortunately I’m not the one to do so… It’s a decent little filler, but it’s not one I’m excited to play although I wouldn’t mind if everybody else wanted to (but only for a couple of rounds - never to a player gets 66 points, because the game outstays its welcome by then!)
I'm only keeping this game because I can play "The Game" with the cards numbered 2-99.

Despite my 'low' rating, I really like this game.

Conceptually, I'm amazed this game was ever invented--where did the idea come from? Enjoyable, chaotic fun. I keep trying to call it "6th Takes" instead of "Take 6" to help newbies pick up the game and be more faithful in translation, but it isn't working. What is working is the Terminal City play variant which is a MUST as it streamlines the mechanics and game length.

I played "Category 5", which includes more (negative) points for certain cards (sort of like stronger hurricanes).  Better than playing "go fish" or "crazy eights".  An easy pickup game.  

I actually find the oringal form, "6 Nimmt" to be more restrictive and not as fun. (and only slightly different)

The later version, "Slide 5" is a poor reprint with lousy graphics and unprotected light paper stock.

This game is somewhat random but a fun occasional filler that leads to much complaining, of a good nature--one would hope.  ("What, I ended up taking that stack with *this* card??

Good game, usually willing to play.  It is a fun diversion.  Very simple to learn and great for non-gamers and all ages.  Anyone serious about finding a winning strategy will be driven to madness.  Some hands seem so obvious what you need to do to get rid of your cards without picking up any pile.  The next hand, you seem to be picking them all up. Some I have played with find this frustrating.  You just can't put your finger on how to succeed every hand.  Oh, and, as a negative,  the cards are really cheap feeling.

This is a pretty fun, quick and tense filler. There isn't a whole lot of game here, but if you have 5 minutes to kill the rules are extremely short. I don't know if I'd pursue owning this game, but if someone pulled it out, I'd be willing to play.

Update: My enjoyment of card games is limited. After my last playing of 6 Nimmt, it just felt like the game was outlasting its welcome (for me). I don't really look forward to playing this one more, unless someone really wants to.

RATING: 3
The legendary Kramer filler...and, as filler goes, sub-mediocre. The game is a pile of blind action selection that almost has bidding like aspects because the card number also determines the order they will be resolved in. With the defined number set in the game (i.e.: 1-34 for a 3 man game) and a smaller number of hands on deck the randomness generated is actually decently controllable because it is fairly easy to track important cards. With more players or with the standard randomly generated deck the chaos is through the roof and it is almost impossible to play with any degree of foresight.

This is filler, and it is very, very light with few meaningful decisions in the sense that you can actually make an informed choice. Most damning to me is the fact that it's not compelling in the way that a Diamant, a Fairy Tale, a For Sale, or a High Society is and it takes a good 20-25 minutes to play, in which time it starts to wear out its welcome. Way too basic and random.

Played this once with 7 people and there was not much in the way of strategy. However with less people it MAY be less chaotic. Also in its favor is it can be played with from 2 to 10 people but unless I had more than 6 people I don't see this being played. I'd rather bring out Koalition which is a much better game for 4-10 people.

Bumping my rating up from 7.5 in Nov 2010 due to the fact that since then, not only has it grown on me but I feel like London on Board misses something when it's not played at the end of a night.

Some thought about what to play each turn, but really the fun is the tension of working out what everyone else is likely to play, and trying to judge your move right. I always have fun playing this and my family love it, too. This and Wizard are probably my favourite card games right now.

Was somewhat fun, but ultimately fails because it is exceedingly hard to predict what your opponents will play. Seasoned card counters have the advantage. It is quintessential filler material, and because it must compete against many other games of this type, I have neither seen nor heard from it since I played it a few years ago. 

[b]Update[/b] I was given this title as a gift, and if you are after a bit of light-spirited fun without too much thought, it remains an acceptable choice. But engaging this game is not, and winning does not feel as an achievement.

I can't believe I've never played any of Kramer's Nimmt series, as the style is right up my alley.  It's a simple card game with a touch of skill, but a heavy dose of second-guessing your opponents.

Players secretly select a card, hoping it will be land close to a card in an existing row.  But if your card ends up as the 6th in a row, you have to take the lot, and score points for each symbol appearing on them.

A simple concept and great fun.  If the hurricane theme is unsettling, other editions will suit you just fine.

Quick, easy to learn, and fun. There is a fair amount of control and tactical positioning with four or less players.

I've had this game since it was 6 Nimmt and have always enjoyed playing it. We do not play the rule where everyone does a simultaneous reveal of cards. That causes a bit too much randomness in the game. Each player if allowed to play one card on their turn and then the turn proceeds. That makes this a game of hand management and guessing what others have. Played correctly, you can force the person about two to you left to pick up more than their fair share of cards. So, if you like to read people during card games and guess their distribution of cards (I'm talking to all you Bridge and Poker players out there), go get this game and be devious.

Molt recomanable com a 'filler' per grups de fins a 10 persones.

I like trick taking games, but 6 nimmt is certainly not amongst my favorites. I want to have control of my actions in a trick taking game and not get pounded because someone else played a card they didn’t even want to play. It’s not terrible, just doesn’t work for me.

First Impression: It pulls the same strings as &quot;Tightrope&quot; but the mechanics are somewhat different.  It&#039;s a pretty high stress game, if you don&#039;t have a &quot;safe&quot; move you often feel like you&#039;re betting on what the others will do.  I lost pretty badly but I enjoyed it :)

A great way to start or end the night as people come and go.
Seems to work well using 5 piles for more than 6 players.
Played once with 9, but not great - with so many cards revealed, you don't get the instant groan when someone realises they're about to take a pile.

Can also play

RATING: 6
I only became aware of this game when the iOS version was released, played a few hands, and then immediately imported a copy of 6 nimmt. I had high hopes for it to be in regular rotation with Tichu, but it just doesn't hold up for me. The play is too quick, the strategy too shallow, and the cards could be better designed to be read more easily from both sides. It also became repetitive very quickly, exacerbated by the inevitable "you, now you, ok you, now you, and you" as one person referees play order after revealing our cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Addictive and versatile game. One of the few euros that a large group will enjoy. Luck figures significantly with lots of players. However, reduce the number of players, remove a few cards, and the game can become very analytical.

Holy moly do I hate this game.  I'd love to say it was total blind luck but that wouldn't explain how I come in last place every. single. time.  I routinely hit 66 before any other player breaks double digits.  How is that even possible?  More a personal insult than a game, really.  Infuriating.  I'm a poor sport, sure, but this game could piss off the pope.

Fast and fun game for up to ten players. Players simultaneously play cards from their hand onto the table and reveal them. The cards are arranged in sequential order onto four tableaus. If one tableau hits six cards, the owning player takes the tableau. You are trying to avoid taking cards. The lowest score when someone hits 66 points wins the game. Excellent filler.

Light filler that feels in the same range of press-your-luck as No Thanks, but maybe not quite as good.   The main problem here is that you don't have any clue what cards your opponents will select, and the sequencing of those cards makes a huge difference.  So, you just pick a card and hope for the best.   The main idea of adding cards to rows until they fill up and then you are forced to take them (which you don't want to do) is workable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable as a large-group filler or family game. Hardcore gamers may get annoyed at the amount of luck and seeming chaos, but it really is a statistical push-your-luck game that is quite fun if approached from a lighter perspective.

RATING: 8
Simple game with quite a bit of luck, but there is some room for simple strategy and tactics. For example, you may consider laying down a card with a number lower than all the rows so you can preemptively take the row with the least bull horns. It's more fun than it has a right to be.

RATING: 7
Have only played a couple of times and not yet with more than four players. This game doesn't yet appeal to me more than other card games that can be played with a standard deck like Hearts or Spades. Need to play with more than four still.

RATING: 5
Definitely better with 5 players over 3 players. I enjoy the simplicity and length of the game, and I like that there seems to be some strategy to explore, but endgame tension doesn't necessarily last for every player. If you grab a giant stack of points, you can be pretty sure you're going to lose no matter what you do, because there just aren't enough points left for everyone to get more than you.

10 cards from each players hand are played into 4 piles on the table. Four random cards seed those piles and the cards played from there on need to be played on the pile with the closest lower number. The rub is all players reveal the card they chose to play at the same time. In sequential order they are added to the right pile. The sixth card played to a pile is forced to pick up the other five. The randomness of a four player game is a bit much, but it's really funny to watch someone take a pile when it had seemed practically empty a turn before.

6 Nimmt is an extremely easy game to play and teach.  Everybody has a hand of cards, you choose one to play and see what happens.  Beyond that there is very little downtime because everything is done simultaneously.  I really appreciate games that do this because in this age of telecommunications some people will pick at thier phones with the slightest bit of downtime.  Is this a game based entirely on luck?  I don't necessarily think so, but it is still quite light.  I think one of the major draws of this game other than ease of teaching is that it does accommodate a large number of players. You should also consider that with 55 tokens of some sort you would be able to play No Thanks using a portion of your 6 Nimmt deck.

One of the great classic games for geeks everywhere, only second to all time favourite "Bluff" (a.k.a. "Liar's Dice"). Although a purely abstract card game this creates a lot of "turn angst" and is more fun than you'd expect, but also not devoid of card management strategy. Underrated on the geek, but a game that you can play again and again without being bored. Kramer has used the basic concepts of this game in other games, sometimes more succesful, sometimes less, but the original remains ultimately playable.

[5 plays] This is a pretty good game, but I've become a little soured on it by playing too much with people who weren't into it.  For a while we kept falling back on this because it's quick, easy to learn, and accommodates a large group.  But when you get people who are bored and playing randomly, it's lame.  Under better circumstances, though, I liked it, and I like the hurricane theme added to the Category 5 version.

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) 6 Nimmt! version: A fun, easy-to-learn card filler with a decent amount of second-guessing going on. For a game with a similar feel, I would prefer [GAMEID=5782], as there is more thought and overt player interaction involved, but for a fast filler with up to ten people, this is a solid pick.

"6 Nimmt" (= 6 Takes) is a light but fun card game for larger groups, very popular as a filler game among gamers.  Now marketed in English with a hurricane theme under the title "Category 5".  What makes it enjoyable (and light!) is that all players must simultaneously select the cards they are going to play.

Easy to teach with a heavy dose of luck makes this a good "grandparents game". Can I spend time thinking about probablilities in an attempt to make an optimal decision? Sure. But you may just see that foiled by someone playing randomly.  Of course, that will sound terrible to some, but I find the double think and chaos mixes well with a fairly linear progression of the card rows to make for an entertaining 20 minutes.  

We just play hand-to-hand without calculating scores according to the rules.  The gameplay is interesting despite the scoring mechanism, not because of it.

Sadly my edition doesn't have the pro rules written in but where the card goes to the closest number, be it higher or low is king.  Very tactical and enjoyable!

For me the game has a nice balance of luck and strategy. I always wonder if there's a best way to play out your cards, or if it's all down to how the other players play theirs. It is a game that plays very quickly and serves very well to either warm up ourselves for the evening, or for a play in between two largers games, or for a game (or two) to end the evening.

This game works very well for "non gamers" and for large numbers of players, though it has a lot more chaos and luck if you play with 10.  But with lower player counts, the better player will win substantially more than the weaker player.

You can just deal cards out and play the first two plays randomly to demonstrate how the game goes, and pretty soon people will pick it up.

This was the surprise hit of 2016. It is simple to play, and simple to explain, and well-liked among everyone, even those who don't play many games.

I had played this before but didn't find a copy until Mayfair released their version.

Wonderful filler, or fast paced game for when you have a lot people over and need to keep them entertained.  Love that it goes up to 10 people.

It's fun, simple, moves quickly, can be fun for dummies because of this, but also fun for smarties because there's plenty of strategy involved.

I think I bought this game on the strenght  of the recommendations I saw here on BGG.  I am happy to say that the praise was well deserved as we discovered a rich game with a lot going for it.  I feel a player as perhaps more control over his fate when there are fewer players but this has all the trappings of a classic we'll play time and again.

After a few plays where we misunderstood a rule, we have now decided that our wrong interpretation is actually more fun to play.  Here's what we do: when the cards are revealed, we can only add cards to the *end* of a queue, not in between the already present cards.  It makes for some pretty brutal situations' especially with the last rows, but we're having fun this way.  Let me know what you think.

6 Nimmt! 誰是牛頭王 2-10(5)
This game is a timeless classic, and one of most accessible game I own - from friends to parents, elderly to small children, the rule is so simple and intuitive. It is also one of most flexible to accommodate a diverse range of player count; a card game works excellent with high player count is an rare commodity in my view, even with 3 players this game still holds the tension quite well. The gameplay design is not entirely brainless, but packs some tactical play mindset for player to discover. Luck of draw is the only negative about it, but hey, that's where the FUN is!

I have Six Nimmt, and love this filler.  The fact that it scales from 2 to 10 and the way it scales makes it the most elegant game I own.  I admire this simple design.

This will always be in my collection.

Aunque el juego se acorta a 2 al haber menos cartas, no es el mejor número para jugarlo. Se disfruta muchísimo más con 5 jugadores, sobretodo porque el factor “NO SE TE OCURRA PONER ESA CARTA AHÍ MALDITO” es mucho más habitual.

Es un juego ideal para llevártelo de viaje: ocupa poquísimo, no necesitas mucho espacio para jugarlo y te lo pasarás de maravilla. Mejor con grupos grandes, ya que con 2 notas que te falta algo. Un juego imprescindible en cualquier ludoteca.

Finally got this version (from a BGG user in Canada) and dumped "Slide 5".  Far better artwork than "Slide 5" and much easier to play.  I still prefer the artwork for "6 Nimmt", but now I can play either that or "Category 5", rather than being stuck with the inferior "Slide 5".  Played two games so far with Mr. Billington (9-10-2011 and today, 9-17-2011), but still prefer the "6 Nimmt" cards (and still waiting for those to arrive in the mail from the German Amazon seller).  Playing *with* Rule #2, rather than without it, I think is more fun.  Not sure if Mr. Billington agrees, though.  Very close game today (9-24-2011) - my score 73, Mr. Billington's score 77.  Played another game of this today (1-28-2012) with Mr. Billington and he won, 60-something to my 80-something.  Before that game, we played another one (same day) and we had to scrap it, because it'd been long enough that we'd both forgotten how to play it.  When we re-learned how to play it correctly (going through the rules more thoroughly), suddenly everything fell into place again.  Something to be said for played a game over and over again (frequently if possible) to keep game rules accurate in the players' minds.  Played another game of this today (4-7-2012) and Mr. Billington won, 70 (him) to 91 (me).  Found another rule we'd forgotten:  If the card you want to play is less than ALL the top card on each of the four piles, you get to choose ANY pile to pick up, not just the one it would've normally been placed on.  There was another rule we'd forgotten, but I'll try to remember to type it up here after our next game.  Abbreviated game of this (only one hand) with Noelle today (7-8-2012).  I won, but who knows who would've had the best score after an entire game?

A nice feeling of tension was created with having to play a card that wouldn't grab you extra cards in the end, but it was certainly more random than I was expecting and there's much better games that create the exact same feeling with a little more ability to control and plan.

RATING: 6.5
I havn't played it for years becuase I lost the game but after reading the rules (in web) and playing it twice in BSW it's all came back to me. The game is very fun and the more players the better. Very light and suggested for parties and for large families. I personally prefer deeper games though so this is only a 6.5.

Na żywo głównie gram na 2 osoby i jest ok, ale zdecydowanie lepsza na 6-8, więcej to już chaos. Na 6-8 osób rozwija taktyczne skrzydła i pozwala na ten dreszczyk emocji a la "mam nadzieję, że nikt nie ma karty o 1 niższej niż ja". Więcej zabawy w małej grze niż mogłoby się pozornie wydawać.

Fun game - seems pretty random with a large group as your strategizing can't account for everyone's actions and seems to only have a marginal effect on the actual outcome.  You could probably play fairly randomly and finish somewhere in the middle of the pack in most games.

Guess work, group think and probability all combine to make a fastpaced filler that isn't mindless.  6 Nimmt! provides tense decisions in a quick amount of time, and like other good fillers it always leaves you thinking you can do better with just one more go. However, it just doesn't appeal, or hold the attention in the same way other filler type card games do.

I've gone through three phases with this now-classic game:

1. I really like this... let's play it a lot!
2. I'm burned out on this... I traded it away.
3. It's the best game in existence for 9-10 players... I got a copy of the Jubilee edition.

Over time, I've come to appreciate the charms of Take 6/6 Nimmt... but Tanz der Hornochsen (the boardgame version) is a much better game.

I only enjoy it with large groups (6 or more).  It's totally chaotic, but a lot of fun.  With smaller numbers there just isn't much of a game.  I would much rather play its offspring, Hornochsen.  Mom and her friends dig it, though, so it was a great Christmas gift to give.

RATING: 6
A Racko-esque type of game where most of the strategy is in deciding the odds of your next card fitting in between a range of valid numbers.  In this game you don't want to be the player that plays the sixth card in one of four cotinuously updating numerical sequences (if you do then your card starts anew sequence and you score the points for the cards in the sequence that you completed.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of our favourite filler games that comes out towards the end of most sessions. Plays extremely well with 6 or 7 players as it is almost impossible for someone not to end up taking some cards. For 4 or 5 players it breaks down a bit since it is easy for some lines to lock out and the sudden death element tobe lost. Fabulous fun though.

RATING: 9
a.k.a. "Category 5" and before that, "Take 6"  A fun card game, with just a smidgen of math -- closer to like counting, really.  Every time I introduce someone to this, they remain skeptical through the explanation of the rules, but at the end of the first, second, third games want to play another.

I started out 2 player with 24 cards -- a fine variation.  

The theme is gratuitous:  you can choose to learn some hurricane trivia, or you can choose to ignore it.

A nice quick game that keeps everyone involved in the action.  Satisfying for a broad range of groups and personalities, including strategy gamers, social/party gamers, and families.  As with many games, it has a strategic feel with a small number of players (4 or fewer) and a chaotic feel with bigger groups.  I like it best with the strategic variant in which the deck is pared down so that every card is in play.

It's really fun! It reminds me of the second half of For Sale, where you have a hand of cards which you have to play and you're trying to outguess every other player to get the best result. The main difference is you're trying not to win any cards.
It reminds me of Coloretto as well, but the scoring is a lot more intuitive and the game can take a lot more players.
I can certainly see why it's so popular and I wish it will stay around for long.

I think any sense of control is illusory, but that's probably okay. 6 Nimmt! is really about trying to avoid a disaster only to set yourself up for something far worse.

But for a filler with gamer friends, I would much rather play Geschenkt, For Sale or High Society

Fun game, fast. Light rule set. You must paly a card. the 6th card takes the row of cards. you accumulate bull heads (I think they look like ticks myself). Fewest bulls wins! With 2 players there is a lot of thought as you have a lot of control. With 7 7 players it is random quick fun to watch people try and avoid taking the stacks.

[Initial Impression: 5]
Okay for a light card game. Difficult to have much of a strategy, given that so many of the cards will not be in anyone's hand on any given round. If your cards happen to be very clumped in value for a round, you'll have a tough time of it. There is some opportunity for trying to determine the most counter-intuitive move so as to take advantage of the simultaneous play mechanic.

An odd game in that it is a hand management game that plays a crowd. It's fairly chaotic although there is some slight strategy in dealing with group-think. It's fun, but after a hand I'm usually ready for something else

Upgraded my rating to an 8, because the new special cards add a nice twist to a game I had hardly played any more.

My old comment for the original version (rating: 7):

An excellent game: Easy to learn, with a lot of Schadenfreude around; playable with kids and adults alike. I have played it a little too often to give it a higher rating, but if you haven't tried it, go for it. It isn't quite as good as Land unter (Turn the Tide), but even simpler.

[b]After 3 plays:[/b]  I don't feel qualified to rate this...  the game hasn't opened it's "magic box" to me just yet.

It seems *fun enough* but every time I'm left with a "is that all there is?" feeling.

[b]After 4 plays:[/b]  After sitting down to play this again over bowls of tortilla soup and Thai veggie stew I get the impression it's more of an activity than a game over which you can exert much control.  Tick the "throwing cards with friends and family" box.

Truly *fun enough* but waaay too random to take seriously or bother burning brain cells over.

I certainly enjoy playing this game with my family. As has been suggested, it is best playing the game with larger numbers of people because it adds to the fun. But in that case it is much more difficult to strategise.
The game invariably induces lively banter and groans when you get hit with a bad round of penalty cards.

Considero que hay un cierto control (a veces hasta un gran control) en cada jugada. Es un juego de psicología, gestión de la mano y control de riesgo.

Algo estresante en las primeras partidas (pierdes y no sabes muy bien por qué. Mínimo a partir de 4 jugadores.

I have several card games for large groups: this, Werewolf, Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg, and Saboteur. This one gets a lot of play because of how much easier it is to explain and because you can choose how long it will last. Just raise or lower the ending point requirements. I'm rating it an 8 because, despite the brilliant yet simple mechanics, there just isn't quite enough depth for me to go higher, as given the chance I would like something with a little more oomph to it.

The theme on the German version makes no dadgum sense. Why would you want the least cattle? Still, I love the goofy graphics of the 6 Nimmt.

While this may be an entertaining romp for a big group, the scoring and mechanics (plus the game being nothing more than a bunch of cards with numbers on them) categorically prevent me from giving this anything higher than a five.  I don't see much of a theme either, but then again my German is degrading from poor to worse rather rapidly.  I wouldn't turn down a game most of the time, but my enjoyment factor wouldn't be anywhere near thru the roof when playing.

Update:  With more players (or perhaps all together) this game has a heavy dose of random that becomes outright annoying with continued play.  My last game was frustrating and pointless as cards wiped away and filled up with no logical pattern.  It seemed like the best strategy was to just pick a middle-to-high value card and throw it down without much thought.  -Stupid and a waste of time.

Fun and simple card game, in which you are doing everything you can to not take any cards as the first person to 66 points loses!

With 5 players there was some strategy involved, but it was clear that with many more people it would basically be impossible to play with any tactics as the board changes as peoples cards are resolved (all while your choice is locked in place) so I wouldn't recommend it for 6-7+ players.  Great fun with 5 though, and incredibly simple to pick up and play.

Who doesn't like games about hurricanes?  Quick game where you want to spend about half an hour or so.  

The game plays differently with the number of players you have.  With a small number of players (3-4), it becomes a guess gaming of what you think of the others will play and answer accordingly.  With a lot of players (6-8), the game is chaotic enough that you can play randomly and score nearly the same as you would if you were planning your moves.

Solid simultaneous play numbers game with variants to make it more or less skill-based depending on exactly what variant you play and how many play.  As usual more people equals more chaos and fewer people seems to= more skill based.  I think I'm missing something as my wife consistently whomps me.  (UPDATE:  My wife is just good.  She dominated everyone else in both 4 and 5 player games as well)

RATING: 6
This is actually a fast and fun little filler game that won Gamer's Game of the Year????? Okay so it didn't deserve that I'm sure but wow apparently it scales 2-10 (I still need to be verify the validity of this as it might be no good past 6) and it has a little decision making albeit really not much meat here and there are certainly much better card games out there.  

Kramer likes blind action selection and he also likes a little chaos, both go together and they show up here but with lower player numbers strategy can be employed effectively. There is some strategy here but I wouldn't call it a strategy game, pretty light weight really but good playing should win over any luck in the game which did seem to be only a little with less players.  It is a guessing game of sorts or more like anticipation of your opponents is an important part of play as is calculating which card to play when and planning the best you can with what you got.

Straight forward, yet difficult, but simple. :)  Some people think that it is all luck, but you have to know when to push out that high card and when to go low.

This is a nice cardgame with a little  strategy but as you add more players it can become a throw out a card and hope for the best situation.Also it can support 2-10 players which is nice also.If you want the same type of game but with more strategy try hornoschen.

A fantastic filler game, 6 Nimmt! or 6 Takes! or Category 5 or whatever one wants to call it is nice mix of mechanics involving luck-pushing and psychology. I compare it to a souped-up version of No Thanks! with a slightly longer running time and a bit more accounting.

RATING: 7.5
A cool little game reminiscent of the kind of games you play with a standard deck of cards, but with a little more to it. There's not many games that go up to 10 players and still work (not as good but still fun) so I keep it for that and it's portability.

EDIT: This game has kept coming back to the table and several of my group now say it's their favourite game. We even play for money now and then. Upgraded score to 7.5

RATING: 7
Great filler card game that plays differently with different numbers.  With lower numbers it is much more predictable while with the higher numbers rows could go from empty to full (and then some) in one round.  I've introduced this quite successfully as a lunch-time game at work, where we've played with 3 to 8 players.  Lots of fun with plenty of laughter and howls of frustration.

Does what it does about as well as can be done. Scales from 2 to 10 extremely well, takes very little time to teach and encourages strategic thought whilst still being accessible for almost anyone. It's also very good fun and very affordable, you can't ask for much more.

Horrible. Why is this so highly rated? The decisions are obvious (90% of the time your best bet is to play the lowest card in your hand). The options are highly limited (often there is only one or two rows available for placement). And luck plays a huge role. The reviews for this (or really 6 Nimmt) sounded so good... what a dissapointment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another quick game that can play up to ten players. Easily learned but a mostly random (I think, lately I've been able to win on a consistent basis but I'm not sure if it's skill or not) game - especially with a lot of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Boring at 2 because the lanes take so long to fill up, and haven't tried it at 3, but at 4-6 it's an amazing blind bidding game.

I usually just play one round of 10 cards for each player, instead of playing to 66 points as stated in the official rules. It's faster, and that's how the Android app plays, so I'm used to it.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (January 2011)

This is a good game from Mr. Kramer. I really liked it. I own the Slide 5 version but I prefer this one because the art is better as well as the card stock quality.

(In theory) it plays equally fast if you have 2 or 10 players as the game is simultaneous. You can explain it very quickly, but the game has a surprising depth, also it is very fun to play. I don’t know anyone who hasn’t liked this game. I prefer to play it with 5 or 6 players, with more I feel the game has more luck than I want to but either way the game is FUN.

Bottom line, a good card game that I always bring to my gaming sessions, as it can accommodate a large number of players it sees a lot of play. This is not

The game almost plays itself... I've won by randomly playing cards from my hand!  A much better way to play would be for players to play cards in clockwise order around the table, with the first player changing each round... at least then you'd have a strategic element.  Highly overrated!

Any game that can be won by just randomly picking cards is close to being broken.

Not my favourite card game, but I'll play when it's offered.

Played a few 2-player games, I hope I'm "missing something."  I feel like the first 5 cards in my hand (after the first hand is complete) have meaning, and then the last 5 thereafter don't, as it seemed that one just played their highest card and hoped the other player had a lower one (meaning; they play a lower card so it goes first, it clears the row, then my card goes behind it alright).

Someone clue me in, I didn't see any strategy guides of tips on the game to help me out (maybe I'm reading a rule wrong, or the game just doesn't work well with 2?).

2015-12-08 - I've only played this one time so far, but I really enjoyed it. It's pretty light, and feels a lot like a reverse trick taking game, like Black Spy. I'm not sure how much is luck and how much is skilled play yet, but I'll enjoying playing it more to find out.

It always surprises me when I play an older game that I had never heard anything about, and find it to be absolutely amazing.  6 nimmt! has been around for more than 20 years and I've only just found out about it.  It's really excellent.  It's all about hand management and speculation.  Everything seems easy enough at the beginning, but soon enough, your opponents' card plays completely changes your hand and just when you think you might have the game in the bag, you'll wind up picking up 30 points.  And you don't want points.  Awesome classic card game.

Good gamer will beat any beginner with very, very few exceptions before you reach 66 points.

Wonderful game of outthinking your opponents.  First, figure out what your safest play is.  Then figure out what your opponents think their safest play should be, and what your safest play should be given that information.  Of course, they will also figure that out, so take that into account.  Fun game, especially on BSW, where you get mooed at when you take any oxen.  Plays differently, but well, for all numbers of players (8 is probably best).  A bit repetitive though.

[>5 Plays] This is one of my favorite filler games. It's a little hard to teach the game to new players, but after a few rounds they usually pick it up. The lack of control can be frustrating to some, so don't play it with anyone who's going to take it too seriously. When played in the right spirit, that frustration is half the fun.

Juego muy divertido.

104 cartas, cada una con un único número 1 a 104, con un valor de puntuación negativa. Tienes que jugar tus cartas tratando de no recuperarlas, pero a veces no es posible y hay que saber cómo jugar para obtener el valor más bajo posible de puntuación negativa.

Su mecánica de juego es bastante simple. Hay 4 filas con un número de salida en ellas. Las cartas se jugarán simultáneamente y, empezando por la más baja, van directamente a una fila en la que que haya una carta con un valor inferior a la carta jugada y que la diferencia entre los dos sea la mínima de las 4 filas. El jugador que ponga la sexta  carta en una fila se lleva las cinco que hubieran allí.

Eso es todo, bastante simple, pero muy disfrutable.

Very funny game.

104 cards, each one with a single number from 1 to 104 and with a negative scoring value. You play your cards trying not to get them back but sometimes it is not possible and you have to know how to play them to get the lowest negative scoring value possible.

Its playing mechanics is quite simple. There are 4 rows with a starting number on them. Cards are played simultaneously and, starting for the lowest one, they go directly to a row where the existing card has a lower value than the played card and the difference between those two is the minimum one of the 4 rows. The player who puts the sixth card in a row gets the existing five cards on it.

That's it, quite simple but enjoyable.[/color]

I've enjoyed playing this and it has been a success with some students I've taught it to.  I enjoy playing it but I'm still haven't decided if the gameplay is totally random or not.  I'm sure you have a little control over your destiny, but it feels so chaotic.  I always like the simultaneous action selection though.  Having played with 10 players (the max), I think I prefer it with 4 or 5.

A wonderful large group card game. Very much a filler game, though could be played for numerous rounds to fill out an hour. It can be played with no randomness of cards to enable more strategic card play, suffers a tiny bit from groupthink bu has some nice decisions to be made. There is some luck of the draw, mitigated by the large number of players and cards in a hand.

Also excellent as a two player game.

Another of these elegant German card games, specifically simultaneous card selection reminiscent of Turn the Tide. If it has a problem I think it's the part where a player playing a low card selects a row to take, with all other cards visible. This open calculation - and potentially choosing a player to target - seems at odds with the rest of the game.

Thrifted on 19/12 2015 and 3/5 2016.

"6 Nimmt".  Though it does have a heaping helping of randomness, the beauty of the game is the exquisite agony of trying to avoid taking those bad, bad points!  Anticipation of pain is the name of the game.  

Despite some chaos (more than "some" with 5+ players), there is definitely strategy, yet for about 25 games I could barely articulate any strategy tips.  Now, after about 100 games, I have my strategies, I'm not learning anything new, so my rating drops from its high of 10.  But still a great game!!

[LUP 17-Jun-2006]Finally broke open the tin and it has got a lot of play since, from four to eight players so far.  We have found that the end game with exactly five players can penalise whoever has the lowest cards, but that could be just our playing style.  A big hit with the lunchtime crowd at work.  So much so that we had to get another deck from Germany.  Thanks to Phil & Don this is now finally avialable in Australia

Category 5 version.

I don't think I would want to play this one with fewer than 5 players. Just not enough cards hitting the table to be interesting. But from 5 on up, I think this game gets better the more players you add in.

Can really be a good end-of-the-evening game when the brain is fried, or a nice icebreaker game if you've got some non-gamers to ease in.

This is a light filler card game which can be played with beginner to intermediate board gamers. Although it is light, it still requires bit of strategic mindset. However, by no mean it will cause too much pressure on players. I think this would be a good choice as casual board game evenings.

:star::star::star::star::star::star::star::star::nostar::nostar: (35 plays November 2017)
Between advanced players, this game can be quite difficult to win which makes it very thrilling to play. It requires card counting ability to calculate probability correct. Nonetheless, this is a fine card game that can let any level of board gamers can enjoy the evening. Only thing I don't like about this game is the theme of the cards. I don't know the behind story of the cow heads. I think Slide 5 or Category 5 are way more cooler than this.

To be fair, I played this just a few times and it was a limited version of the game; just one hand of 10 cards each.  However, possible owing to the required sorting feature of the game - all of the cards have an index value - it seemed to be a trivial thing to properly set the pace for the winning hand.  Sort of like a "MinMax" algorithm for a computer game - a bit dry to implement during game play but useful to achieve victory with players unaware of that fact.

I have most often played this as a 2- and 3-player, and have had fun every time we've played. Because I often play the same opponent, I have been lazy and not worked on more than 1 strategy. If she ever figures out my basic gameplan, I'll be sunk, but, so far, it is one of the 1st games where I have been able to independently devise and execute a strategy and see it work. Except for when a 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. opponent is added- then I am hopeless.

Expected this to be a lot of luck and rather bland, but I was pleasantly surprised. There was a lot of tactical calculation in trying to predict what others might be thinking of playing, to keep yourself safe. And if you're really sneaky, you could be shooting to keep the numbers on the stacks close to each other, making it far harder for people to avoid taking a row. Very nice card game, with easy rules and broad appeal.

Either way, it's fun -- it's just a dramatically different game.

RATING: 6.5
Its greatest asset is that it can be played with 2-10 players, though I imagine the 2 player game to be infinitely drab. The problem is that the more players you have, the more volatile it becomes. Some might say that only adds to the tension, which is what makes the game interesting in the first place. It's very good filler. End of story. Plus, if you get bored, grab a handful of chips and play Geschenkt.

While it has very simple rules, there is clearly some depth to the game, at least for a small number of players.  Chance influences the game heavily, but there are definite tactics and strategies available.

I think I've mostly played the game slightly incorrectly but I think the difference has pretty minimal impact.  The game has certainly seen less play though.

RATING: 7.2
A fast-paced card game that's very easy to learn (English instructions are easily found here at BGG) but with a decent amount of depth of strategy.  There's some luck of the draw involved, but similar to Red 7, it's very much about timing, hand management, and predicting what your opponent is going to do.  It's simple to get started but has lots of replay value once you start figuring the strategic elements of the game.

Theme is super-basic and unimportant; the play's the thing.  With two people, it can take a while to play, so you should considering lowering the point threshold or agreeing to a limited number of hands.  Otherwise a fun, quick, interesting, and portable game.

I rate the English version, Category 5, slightly higher than Tag 6 because the graphic designer made the cards easier to read upside down, a definite necessity for SOMEONE at the table when you play.

Fantastic!  Easy to travel with (small tin).  Easy to explain, but very difficult to play extremely well.  The "problem space" is really vast.  I played with 3 people, and it made for a very fun and reasonably strategic game.  It supports up to 10 players, which would be outright chaos, I'd imagine.  At that point, it would be tough to use much strategy, and you'd have a fuzzy sense (at best) of "this card is safer than this other card).

This is the standard opener/filler game at Westside Gamers, and I've come to really respect its flexibility.

A good filler game where you get 10 cards and select simultaneously.  You resolve in number order and put them on a row where it can go next after the highest number in the row.   If you are the sixth card you take all the cards and leave the one you played.  Each card has cattle symbols that increase your score.  The lowest score wins.  

Fun filler but there is little strategy to the game despite what others say.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Better than Uno for a pastime game--and, yes, this is faint praise.  I would note that you can play No Thanks! (a much better game than Category 5, IMO) with the cards and some poker chips or pennies or whatever.  I seem to be in the minority in feeling that this game lacks meaningful decisions.  I'm even in the minority within my own game preferences in that I like games like this one--somehow just not this one.  I'd give it another try and maybe it would click.

UPDATE:  Played it a time or two on Boardgamearena.com and it seems much better.  Will have to try it again as I think it will be good for 5-6 players where No Thanks! is a stretch or not good.

6 nimmit! is a quick game with lots of luck and a bit of strategy. Avoiding taking cards can be difficult depending on the draw, but it's always fun to trick others by picking up a row early or boosting a low number with a much higher card. The extra 10 cards are interesting, making it easy to pick up a row at any time, but will pretty much decide the winner of the game if a player is lucky enough to get more of them.

[Re-themed "6 Nimmt!"; my comment is the same.]
With 2-4 players it is an interesting game of decisions.
With 5+ players it is a sort of party game (I like it much more with 4 players).
Simple rules and no dead time (everyone chooses the card to play at the same time).
Fast paced. Quick.

So far, we have only played this a couple of times. Our first impressions were favorable. The way the game "backs you into a corner" as you get more cards played is very interesting. 

The shuffling instructions are not very clear. We never cleared the table - taking additional cards off the deck after each round of 10 moves - shuffling only when the deck was spent. I think the game pace would be too slow if the table were cleared and he cards shuffled after each round. 

I suspect that the rating will increase a bit when we get some more familiarity with the pace of the game.

This game is a blast.  It's best with a full table (or at least 4) because when you lay your card down, the more chance for the board to change the more fun the games seems to be.  I'm someone who love to see others' plans get foiled and with a full table, it happens a lot.  Of course, I have to play the role and be dramatically frustrated when my plans are foiled as well.  This game is a great filler.

Fantastisches Spiel, funktioniert als lustiger Absacker ebenso wie in der Taktikvariante als lupenreines Strategiespiel. Da Wolfgang Kramer auf seiner Homepage noch weitere interessante Varianten anbietet, ist dieses Spiel noch lange nicht ausgereizt. Einfacher Einstieg, unglaubliche Spieltiefe.

I've usually played this with 2 to 4 players and using the optional rule to limit the cards to 1 to 24, 34 or 44.

Although, of course, luck plays a part so too does card-counting,  knowing your  opponents and playing the percentages. 

Quick and fun and (rarer than either) I tend to win it more often than I lose.

This was one of the first card games, I actually liked. It can easily be played with people that have no gaming experience at all and yet, cleverness is needed to win this game. Because your result during the game is highly dependent on what cards other players secretly choose, this game guarantees a lot of fun and laughter.

I have the "Category 5" version.  Fun little card game played in rounds.  Goal is to come out with the lowest score in as many rounds as possible, and ultimately at the end of the game.  Fits in the same family as Poison, Coloretto, and No Thanks.  It's great that the instructions came with a few variants to alter the game if your group so desires.  You can turn it into a game where you can be a little more certain what cards your opponent(s) have yet to play.  It probably has a bit more depth that the other games I listed.

A quick filler. Has some interesting variants if you wish for more complex options, but the base game is still quite fun. I've rarely played to a full 100 points as I tend to use this one as a opening or closing game for a night with new players that are not gamers. Just to show how different games can be without getting into complex rules.

There are better multi-player card games out there. This one might as well be played random, the chaos is high, and usually I do not mind that but there is little control over anything here and not enough take that to be any fun.

Oddly, it doesn't bother me here that random seems to be a somewhat viable strategy.

2-10p, 45 m.  Highly rated blind-bidding/simultaneus action game from W. Kramer.  Great way to cleanse the pallet after a heavier game.  Local game store wouldn't order it for  me, so I had to order online.
I have the "Category 5" English edition (a good name for a computer networking geek like me) which seems quite nice: sturdy linen-finish cards.  My only complaint is the tuck-box--I prefer 2-part card boxes with lift-off lids.

Did not think I would like this game but a buddy showed it to me and I came to really like it. Simple card game that can be played passively or competitively. Not a ton of strategy going on, but knowing when to play the right card and anticipating what others might play does open the game up to some interesting choices.

Just picked this up, and my wife and I have really enjoyed it as a 2-player game.  It fits nicely when we only have a short time to play the game, and so far the scores have been pretty pretty close and we've each won some games.  I'd like to try this with a few more people -- seems like it would be rather different with 5-6.

This is pretty much our go-to filler at the beginning of a session while we wait for everyone to turn up. We don't always play to the 100 point game end, often just a couple of hands; nevertheless, a really good game with more depth to it than might first be thought. I most certainly have not yet figured it out yet (not sure I ever will)

RATING: 7.5
Very fun medium to large group game. Strategy, estimation, and probability are more useful tactics with fewer players. The game becomes ever more chaotic with each additional player.

With higher player counts people are collecting piles (negative points) nearly every card play.

It's fun (in a weird, mean way) to mess with the game's natural flow. Cards always align in increasing number order and if you time certain plays right, you can effectively "cap" off rows with large number cards. This turns 6 nimmt into a contest of trying to avoid picking up piles (with low cards) because so few cards can add onto them. It's fun to successfully "draft" behind someone forced into grabbing a bad row.

This is a trick taking card game that whoever puts sixth card in a row will take the entire row except the sixth card. Taking cards means negative point and generally makes it harder to win the game.

This is a great filler indeed. My wife and sister-in-law started with like whatever but then at the end we are all became very serious about the game which was a very sweet brain teasing moment. There isn't much of strategical decision making point but it could go really tense if players are all agree to. Definitely more to play.

It was a very easy to learn and quick to play game. My wife and sister-in-law literally learnt this game within a minute and we were able to start enjoying it. It is very interesting trick taking mechanic that I need to understand what other players would draw what cards. Definitely a good filler.

I've gotten a lot of mileage out of this one. I like how you can play it with large numbers of people (though note: the more people you play it with, the less that you can play the odds to get into a certain spot). It's fun when you think you're going to take a row and suddenly you realize someone else has to go before you do.

Just another boring card game with a little bit of strategy, but nothing special.

My strongest memory of this game is playing the wrong card from my hand--that is, I had the perfect card but grabbed a different one--at one point. Another guy looked at me and said, "That was an...interesting play." By which he meant, "You're a dumbass." But he's a nice guy so found a more civilized way to say it.

Come to think of it, I'm not sure it was even this game. It could have been some other boring card game. That's how memorable the damn thing is.

It's a cute, quick filler which I would certainly play again but it really has little depth and some control issues (so you're really playing your hand against the odds of what others can/will play).  UPDATE: rating moved up a point as I'm starting to see some significant hand-management decisions.

I'm rating this as a "game system" like a poker deck for it's ability to play many games, not just itself.  I've heard the regular game (which I haven't played) is good fun for a group of friends or family though.

Deck of cards numbered 1-104 (just one card of each number).

RATING: 6
Quite entertaining! The decisions are simple but there is suspense in the reveal, joy/angst in seeing who takes the points, some screw-you tactics in low card row choice, and fun conversation in sharing the reasoning behind card choice. I'd like to do more comparison between the full-deck rules vs. the 4 + 10 x #players variant.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played once, with seven people.  A relatively quick game that's easy to explain, whose sole selling point (in my mind) is that it's a quick game that's easy to explain.  The game is based around playing cards, which get added to sets of cards on the table; once a set gets to a pre-determined size, the next player to add a card must take the entire set (and thus lose points).  The gameplay was a bit chaotic, as cards are played simultaneously but actions resolved in numerical order, meaning the board can change drastically before your card is placed.  

Like Timbuktu, it seems as though players want to play this game quickly, meaning that you don't have enough time to analyze the tactical situation in front of you before playing.   Additionally, and possibly worst of all, even though the game is entirely dependent on reading the card numbers quickly, it's surprisingly easy to mis-read the numbers (69/96, 86/68, 23/32, etc.) or just not notice an important card on the table.

[Update after a second play: The group I played with for a second time took much more time to plan their card choices, making the game _much_ more enjoyable.  By having even just 30 seconds more time I could start to balance the risks of each card, and make a much more informed decision.  I also had enough time to read the cards on the table.  My rating has thus been increased from a 6 to a 7.]

Really solid game. I definitely like how I can play it with board game veterans and novices alike. It can be a bit frustrating to play with people who don't care for it and feel there's no strategy to bluffing numbers but that's more on the players than the game. It does take a bit of time to play a game to completion though, which knocks down the score a bit.

Decent light game. Don't really feel the need to play this, there are better games in this category, especially as I very rarely need a game for the larger groups where 6 Nimmt shines.

Easy for smaller children, good fun for grown-ups. Tactical variant (but I deal the cards randomly, the picking of cards is boring) is recommended for smaller number of players (say three or four). 

Indifferent.

AKA 6 Nimmt! 

You start w/ 10 cards and play down 1 secretly. You then play the card down on one of 4 rows and if you're the 6th card, you take the previous 5 and place the new one.

That's it!

Sounds good!

Great filler card game that only gets better as the number of players approaches 6-10.

Rules are uber simple and the amount of control is something like 30%. But this game is about fun...fun in large groups. One of the best filler card games out there I think in a social context.

RATING: 7
6 Nimmt! is a very easy to learn game. The rules are very simple and the game plays at a good fast pace. This is what I would call an "extended filler" type of game as it takes a bit longer than the average simple filler. There is some strategy and some tactical elements to the game as the cards played by others are constantly dictating what cards you need to play in order to avoid taking points. The more players the more chaotic and seemingly random the game can feel as so much changes from hand to hand. With 2 players the game takes on a bit more of a purely tactical feel as you can predict somewhat better what are the optimal moves... to a point anyway. Even with 2 players the landscape can change in a hurry mucking with well made plans but that's the point of a tactical card game like this. I don't know if this game will rise much higher than a 7 or so for me as it's pretty basic but in the same train of thought.. there is enough here and the game plays quickly and easily with really any number of players that it won't drop far either. Basically a very solid filler style card game well suited for social and family gaming and one of the better light card games I own.

Don't get the hype.  After just a few plays, you realize the the actual options you have at any given time are so few that  the game begins to feel like nothing more than sorting out your cards into 2-3 possible piles, all of which you know ahead of time and which is always the same.  Which cards to play and where is the same every game, so it gets really boring really fast.

Fun light game, playable by many people. Play cards in 6 available rows, which bound the allowable values. If you are the 6th card in a row, pick up other 5 cards in your hands, some of which have penalty points (pictured as "bullheads"). First player to 66 bullheads ends the game, lowest score wins. Fun, reminds of a bit of Land Unter where you try to guess the range of cards opponents are playing. All you can do is estimate, play the card and hope! Over a series of hands, presumably the smartest/best estimator should emerge.

There are other variants as well with the bullcards: You can voluntarily pick up a row with at least 3 cards to earn a bull. Each bull allows you to play multiple cards on one stack. After you pick up, two new cards are revealed, escalating the pace of the game.

Para menos de cuatro jugadores recomiendo jugarlo con filas más cortas (quien ponga la quinta carta, en lugar de la sexta, se lleva la fila). Tampoco lo recomiendo para más de seis jugadores, ya que se vuelve demasiado aleatorio y casi imposible calcular nada. Para 4-6 jugadores es tremendamente divertido, donde incluso los no jugones más reacios se quedarán enganchados partida tras partida.

One of my favourite card games/fillers. I have yet to encounter a person who would not like to play it again after one session. Works well with 2-7 people (a bit chaotic with 8-10 though (but fun!). With fewer players (2-3) we usually play the "advanced version". I love the tension and anticipation created by the simultaneous card-turning. After 100s of plays it's becoming clearer that there's much less randomness (and more strategy) than many a seasoned player would like you to believe...

There's never a safe play in this chaotic, but fun, card game. It's best asset is that it works well with just about any number of players. **UPDATE** This was a game I played early in my exposure to Euros - hance my initial enthusuasm over its cleverness. As I played it more and sampled many more card games, I came to see how random this game really is. It can still be fun if played from a "let's see who gets hosed the most and laugh about it" perspective, but there's really not a lot of competitive game there, at least using the standard rules. Maybe there's a variant we could try that might make this more strategic, and thus, more worthwhile to play.

Takes a relatively long time for something that's supposed to be a filler - I think it's just too long for a filler and too light to be a full-fledged game. However, strategy is evident - people who play randomly obviously have to get extremely lucky to actually get anything working - while people who play their cards wisely and practice hand management go ahead. Still, it's too much of the same. It's still a decent game.

December 21st, 2007: Raised from 6 to 6.75. Honestly, it's a pretty fun game. With experienced players, the cards play pretty quickly, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.

The strategic content is very easy to grasp, but then there's also some intuition component and the luck factor that produce very fun situations.

RATING: 9
A simple mechanism: four rows of cards need to get filled up to a length of five with cards of increasing value; a card must be laid after the last card in a row that has the closest value to it. The sixth card on that row gets the poor player all the cards (the ticks on their tops are minus points). Now the twist: all players lay their cards at the same time, so they don't actually know in what order they'll fill the rows.

While 6 nimmt! looks like the typical easygoing game to take on a trip it soon reveals to be a rather sneaky creature for the healthy amount of luck it has - there's obvious risk in the moves, and the same cards that can save a round for you will condemn you the next one. The more players, the less predictable the game is (four players are probably the best configuration).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Gioco di carte molto semplice, un tantino casuale ma comunque apprezzabile. Lo scopo è quello di liberarsi di tutte le carte in mano ma senza prendere le carte in gioco, operazione non così semplice specie se si gioca con molti giocatori. Simultaneamente si giocherà una carta e, a seconda delle carte già in gioco, la si incolonnerà alle carte già in gioco. Se la carta giocata è la sesta della propria fila si dovrà prendere in mano tutta la fila tranne la carta appena giocata. Gioco dalla spiegazione immediata che ogni tanto si può anche proporre specie a gruppi numerosi. Il gioco secondo me perde di brio diminuendo il numero di giocatori.

Fast-paced, fun, card filler. What's not to like?

What I DON'T like (at least in my 6 nimmt edition), is the silly styling which means the numbers are often read upside-down, plus the fact that the deck is much too large for 4-5 players. There are a couple of good tacked-on variants to deal with the latter.

[i]This was a very fun filler, card game that plays well with larger groups (we had 6 players). The game play was simple, but decisions were not. Good card play will easily mitigate the luck of the draw in this game. I'm curious how it'd play at lower counts, but I could see playing this with our extended family during the holidays.[/i]

Fun, fun, and more fun. This game is also a great math exercise for the younger player. With 3 adult players, the game lasts only a short 10-15 minutes and can you can attempt to develop a bit of a strategy. A very solid 9!

RATING: 7
It's a good filler. It feels chaotic/incomprehensible at first. After a few game you get a handle on the strategy, but with an unlucky draw you are still screwed. Thankfully it is only a 10 minute game. 

It is best played just a single time as a filler, rather than 3 or 4 or 5 times until someone reaches 66 points as per the rules.

I actually have "Category 5", which is the same game in English, with a superfluous hurricane theme.  When we were trying to play this game for the first time, we found it too complex to be fun (we had to keep stopping to read the rules, and we played slowly).  Also, it seems translatable to a (couple) standard decks of cards, so I wasn't sure it was worth the money.  We were very disappointed.  I recommend playing with an experienced player, because when somebody with a lot of practice dealt for me, it went much faster and we actually had fun.  My rating of this game doubled at that point.

RATING: 9
Masterful trick-taking game that bends your mind in interesting ways. As with any card game, it's hard to employ any strategy because everything is so random and you can't foretell what your opponents will play, but this game was fun to play after a heavy engine-building Euro. While not as brain-burning as Arboretum, 6 Nimmt! still engages everyone and provides a nice cooldown for a day of gaming.

RATING: 5
Simultaneous revelation, where you’re guessing what other people might play so as to avoid placing the 6th card in a row. It works fine as a semi-random, semi-mindless filler if you have just 10 minutes up your sleeve, but there doesn't seem a lot of other point, and I'd never want to play rounds and rounds. The problem is that the primary sensation it generates is woe, and there’s no counterbalance of joy when you guess right - the max you get is a sense of relief. So it’s rare to come away from the game feeling happy that you’ve played.

Card game where the main mechanic is trying to guess which of your cards is best to play by guessing what number card your opponents will play. There's not a lot of information to inform your decisions, so it's quite luck-based in the end. (There is some strategy around hand-management; i.e., which cards to play now and which to keep.)

The main strength of this numerical card game is that it can accommodate up to ten people without causing a whole lot of extra downtime (since everyone plays simultaneously).  Unlike a lot of huge-player game, you feel like you have some control over what's going on, too, though admittedly that is lessened toward the higher end.  Good fun without a lot of commitment.

Simple, quick and generally luck based. I can't believe I hadn't gotten this to the table sooner. I need more plays of it, but it's a brilliant filler, especially if you do the half/half variant and just play through the deck once.

Edit: Upon further plays, this game is less luck based than it first lets on. It's still criticized in our group as being luck based and random, yet somehow I tend to win a good percentage of the time. Go figure.

Nice game, bit too random but still you get the satisfaction when you succeed in guessing what cards your opponents will play.

Game allows very good range of amount of players: 2-10 and the amount of players doesn't affect much the time needed to play the game as every one is playing his cards in the same moment. Unfortunately the more the players the more random the game becomes to be.

Some long-term vs. short-term decision-making disguised as a "what do I do right now?" set of choices.  Much more chaotic with 6 or more, though you can hedge your bets with more people.  A little too long to be a filler, though it can always be played for only one round. Not to be taken too seriously.  If all players are of equal skill, luck becomes the determining factor.  On a bad note, if someone's an obvious leader, there's no way to target him to bring him back to the pack as in most other games.

Not sure how this plays will more (up to 10!) people, and am looking forward to trying it.

Suffers in comparison with its "cousin" Hornochsen. If we have 6 or fewer players, we'd rather play that. Still, "Category 5" (the version I own) gains points for accomodating a large number of players and the theme is all too relevant here in Florida.

After playing a lot of other filler card games, I'm bumping my rating up to an 8. This is the best. It's light and easy, but has more than enough tactical and strategic decisions (as long as you play it with 5 or less people) to keep it interesting. It's just random enough; clever play, paying attention and smart hand management are rewarded, yet everyone has a chance to win. Fast and fun; highly recommended!

RATING: 6
Update: Well nearly 20 years later and I'm now finding the game play repetitive when played to 66 pts., despite the tension and fun it creates. I think Montgolfiere for families and For Sale for more skill are a better choice nowadays.

6Nimmt was my second taste of German games back in '96, so I've played many times over the years, but in the last session I found out the reason for the bull theme. You are often ruminating what card to play, going ermmmm, and bellowing when it all goes bad!!!! Very subtle. Anyway, I dig grass, sorry digress, this is a good game providing  tension, many a close phew, and fun when someone picks up those previous five cards. There can be some deliberate targeting when someone assesses which row to take, which may cause alittle negativity. One of the few quick paced cardgames for 5-6 players; any more than that and I find determining who goes first etc. becomes longwinded.

This is a highly entertaining card game with simple rules but tricky play. It is neither a trick taking game nor a climbing one. It is not much of a game of strategy or tactics, rather requires some situational analysis and deduction. Although there is some level of control, there is enough randomness that at least in a few hands during the game you get stuck with unwanted card piles through no fault of your own. But it is decent for a filler and accomodates up to 10 players.

A good end-of-the-night card game which will take up to an impressive 10 players. It's also much, much better when you get the rules right, unlike the first time I played! We were playing that lowest card goes first, and then round clockwise, instead of ascending number order.

6 Nimmt! is a great game to end a gaming session with.  This game has a good combination of stategy, tactics and psychology.

The standard game ends with someone scoring more than 66, but the devilishly long game ends with someone scoring 666 or more!  So 6 Nimmt! with the devils horns (or oxen horns) on the cards is the better version to play with.  (Particularly appropriate when you have to take 6 cards with a high penalty point score!)

But BGG need to separate out Category 5 which should be combined with Slide 5.

RATING: 7.5
My favorite filler game! It takes a couple of turns for everyone to see how the card ordering works. After that, the game plays fast and is pretty simple. Despite its length, the game does have plenty of depth. There's definitely some strategy involved as to when to play each card.

In principle this is an easy game but to play it well is a different story. I still have no idea what is a good way of playing.
There five rows of cards. You have to place a card at the row what is the highest value and lower than your card. If you place the card as sixth in that row you have to take the first five cards to your penalty pile.

Simple to play, hard to oversee.

RATING: 7
Fun, fast bluffing game.  This game is good with two players but truly amazing with 6.  I recommend using the variant where only the first 10n+4 cards are used where n is the number of players.

I love the hurricane trivia.  More games should throw in educational information especially if it doesn't detract from game play.

Hurricane naming conventions are such that future hurricane names are planned in advance.  Because of this, planned hurricane names like Rita (which now have greater historical significance) are included innocously as "future" hurricanes as they had not occured yet when the game was printed.  For me it's thought provoking and makes for a much more satisfying gaming experience than a game solely intended to be "fun".

March 2013: Downgrade from 6 to 4. Although it's really easy to teach and newbies grasp it quickly, it is really, really dry. To me, it's only fun to screw someone over if I know exactly whom I'm screwing over!

May 2010: I insist on playing with the variant in which the number of cards equals the number of players times 10 plus 4. That means every card in play will either be on the table or in a player's hand. This makes it much more entertaining since you can be more confident that someone will be screwed.

6 Nimmt is one of the best card games ever.  Dead simple, get anyone up and going in 30 seconds, yet with a surprising bit of strategy (and psychology) involved.  Fast and easy enough to please the light gamers in our group, yet meaty enough for the more serious folks.

As with most card games there is some luck factor, but here it's just enough to keep the playing field even.  A very nice filler game, that really should be back in print.

I played randomly the first hand and lost big, saw the strategy to use, and wiped everyone out for the rest of the game.  I like a game that gives you a lot of choices, the more the better, and this game is definitely NOT it: you get 10 choices finally narrowing down to 1 (i.e. no choice) as the hand progresses.  As far as controlling your actions in the game, it sorta feels like you're caught in a hurricane, and you can get hit pretty much at random.  It's an ok diversion, I suppose, but not my type of game.

Very Clever quick card game!  Played with different groups (gamers & non-gamers alike) and found it easy to teach and everyone liked it, even when they were losing.  No one is bored since everyone plays their card at the same time!  AKA no down time!  Something that is quite rare.  Some say that it is taunted with to much luck, but that can be reduced if you prefer by giving each player a higher hand limit.  But even with the luck it has enough tactical strategy to get your head thinking some.  Highly recommend as a good filler game or for playing with non-gamers.

This game is fine. It was fairly random though. There might be some more depth to the decisions and planning that can be done to come out ahead. However, it's still mostly just guesswork trying to figure out what your opponents might play and luck in what cards you're dealt. There are too many other games that I'd pick to play over it. The only thing going for it is that it has an app version that I might stumble upon when I'm looking for variety.

playing randomly is a competitive strategy.  This is a problem.

I know the statistics for online play show that experts have a higher win rate.  That does not preclude the possibility that the game is still way too random.  Consider Burgun's example of dice chess -- play chess, then roll a die and reverse the win on a 6.  That game has a strong correlation to skill, but it is still a bad game.  6 nimmt appears to be more random than dice chess...too much even for a fast game, in my book.

update after more online plays:  what little meaningful choice there is, appear to be entirely tactical and not very deep.  And the best play will still backfire a lot.  Some call this chaos.  I call it unsatisfying.  And I DO like chaos in short games.

Also, the opening hand you are dealt is a good predictor of ultimate victory.  That is bad form even in a random game.

I have the German version (6 nimmt!), but my family refuses to play. They say the card design is ugly and annoying.

Update Dec 2013: We use this deck for No Thanks, so I've found a reasonable use for it.

Biztos vagyok benne, hogy az immár 20 éves kártyajáték '94-ben megelőzte a korát. Roppant egyszerű, gyakorlatilag 4 pontból álló szabállyal bíró, számlapokat tartalmazó kártyajáték. Tematikája sajnos nincs, ennek ellenére valami megmagyarázhatatlan varázsa van, ami miatt az ember mindig szívesen játszana még egy partit.
Nem kifejezetten rövid, sokszor azért erősen agyalós játék (főleg 2-n). Megfejthetetlen, hogy a szerencse, vagy a másik gondolatának kitalálása dominálja-e jobban a játékot.

Good chaotic fun.  I think it *feels* like there's more strategy than there really is, because you're so at the mercy of other players' choices.  But that's okay for a game like this; the chaos feels right for some reason. The unpredictability increases with the number of players.

RATING: 4
Blind-bidding games either use the whole deck to give you tedious card-counting or use a partial deck to make you play only within a range of #s and hope for the best. 6 nimmt is the latter. Really, you could probably do better in this game if you rule out the definite bad cards, then randomly play one from the rest. Chaotic, with each additional player adding another source of chaos and twisting the game (since it's always the 6th card that takes the row, no matter how many).

Turn the Tide is better, and I don't even like TtT. At least with TtT you could study risk-taking tendencies. This one is chaotic both with the risk they take, the row they go for, and the row others go for.

I have found that I have quite enjoyed this game.  In general, I find games with blind decisions less than optimal.  However, in this game, it seems to work.  There is a lot of psychological guess-work when trying to determine what you should play.  It took me a couple of games before I started to develop a feel for how it goes.  Another interesting twist is that the game changes dramatically with differing numbers of players, particularly once you get six playing.  Since it's purchase, it has become one of my wife's favorite card games to introduce to other people.  We've had a lot of fun with this one.  Updated 12/15/06 (8)

RATING: 3.5
It a great game for a weird niche: gamer's quick party game for in between the other games. I don't think I need to buy it, as with friends usually some more creative game will take its place (Dixit, Werewolves). And for adrenalish rush wake up Jungle Speed is better. 

Rating goes down. Too random to make sense, too gamey to be a party game. I found I'd rather leave early than play this as a session's closer. Have 15 minutes and a group of 5+ players? - play Resistance. Have fewer players - play No Thanks. 

Rating goes up - there is some double think if you play with people capable of what those two words imply (namely thinking). Which I haven't. If people who what they're doing, it's better.

A light card game in which cards are played simultaneously each turn. Each card is then assigned to the row ending with the value closest to it. If a player's card causes a row to exceed 5 cards, then he or she is forced to take the whole row as a penalty. 

Despite the chaotic outlook, keeping track of played cards and careful hand management can mitigate luck in games with low player counts. However, it becomes more volatile and party-game like with more players. It's alright for a simultaneous selection game, but at lower player counts I'd rather be playing [thing=1403][/thing] instead.

I just picked up the Category 5 version of 6 Nimmt! abd I have to say that this was an extremely fun, fast party card game. I played with only 4, but I cannot wait to play with more.

RATING: 6
A fast, light filler. Pretty chaotic as number of players goes up, but still fun. Especially nice playing on BSW where it automatically puts the cards in the right places. For a more strategic variant, play only with cards 1 - (10n+4) ('tactic' on BSW). For something a little different, either requiring more thought to predict or just making the game even more chaotic (and fun!), play to the left OR right of cards, whichever is closest ('profi' on BSW)!

--- Summary ---
Card are numbered 1-104. Deal 10 to each player, then 4 face up to the table. Players choose a card and reveal simultaneously, then play in ascending order. Must place their card to the right of the card they are closest but not UNDER. If it's the 6th card, they take the first 5; the 6th becomes the new start card for the row. If the played card is lower than the last card of each row, choose a row to take - the low card replaces that row. After 10 cards, tally points (# of cowheads shown on cards taken). Shuffle and repeat till someone gets 66+ pts: lowest pts wins!

6/10

RATING: 5
This is an extremely simple card game.  The deck is numbered 1-104 and each card is worth a varying number of negative points.  Each player's goal is to collect as few cards, and therefore negative points, as possible.

This is done by laying out 5 rows of a maximum of 5 cards.  Each player secretly plays a card each turn that needs to go at the end of a row with the least amount of difference between the last card of that row and the played card.  If a card is played that is lower than any last card in a row they have to take a row of cards.  They also have to take a row if they add the 6th card to that row.

There is a tiny bit of strategy to this.  A lot of it is actually guessing which cards your opponents are going to play and how you can play around that to get cards out of your hand without taking them.  However, even more so than that, this game is all about complete luck of the draw...or deal as it were.  How well you do is based on how good of a hand you are dealt at the start of the game.  Dealt a 1?  Well, you automatically have to take at least 1 point this game, too bad.

There is an alternate variant where you draft the cards but that sounds even less interesting than the normal rules.  I know I like similar games like Love Letter and Cabo but those actually have a lot of charm to them.  This is literally a deck of numbers with cow heads on them, nothing to really win me over at all.

This is a filler game where you are trying to get rid of cards, but if you place the 6th in the row, you must keep the whole row. This game was too random for me at the higher player counts as there are just so many cards being placed at once. The plus to this filler game is that there is minimal downtime and can accommodate higher player counts.

One of the best simple card games for a group, in which you try to avoid getting any cards.  The theme is that you are all bulls avoiding getting branded, and whoever gets the least brandings wins.  So many times I've narrowly avoided getting "burned" by avoiding placing the 6th card in a row.

RATING: 6.5
[Pando 'Category 5' 2004 edition] {Filler; reverse-set-collection, simultaneous action; scalable} {6 basic rules, 7 with 2n\+4 variants} C5 is an exciting light-weight card game. Recommended for large party (in addition to werewolves, and saboteur). 6N has loads of player interaction and fun - players are yelling when they are forced to take cards! :) It is tactical for 2-5 players and is chaotic for 6 players. (Typo can be considered if one wants similar play with word rather than number, but Typo is slower and more static.)

Variant setup (2n\+4) shall be used to make C5 more tactical; it's just too chaotic when all cards are used in a small group.

The theme is tenuous: the hurricanes add little meaning to the game. C5 has cards from 1 to 104, which is very useful for prototyping and testing.

[Revision] Hornochsen can be considered if one wants serious game. I still prefer 6 Nimmt! because 6N is more fun. In addition, there are other better choices than Hornoschsen, in the aspect of strategic card games.

I'll save my full comments for Slide 5, since that's the version I own, but I'll just quickly say that I prefer the snazzy-and-nonsensical bull-head motif of 6 Nimmt! to the blander skiing theme for Slide 5.

Bought this to replace Slide 5 as I like the theme better.
This is not so much a game as an activity. The luck factor is insane even if you count cards. Playing with a suitably reduced deck fixes this but even then the card distribution can hose you. I still enjoy playing it but it's not a game where I try to win.

i love this game & never have a hard time getting people to play. only once was it not fun, but we were all in a very bad mood already, too bad. otherwise it's a blast. i'm still trying to work out the strategy for this. when i win, i know what i did right, when i lose, i have no clue. good light game for all people types (so far).

A perfect closer to any gaming night. We tend to play one hand and score a number of times over rather than playing to the recommended 66 which can mean that a run of bad cards will kill you, but great fun nonetheless.

Update: I've now played this 75 times and can honestly say that I love it. It's a wonderful joy teaching it to people (once they get the rule about placing lower value cards).

Up from 7.5 to 8.2 and then up again to 9.

Eh.  It's fun as a filler game, and it has a sort of "That that!" metric which leaves people sometimes crying in anguish as they are the one that has to take an entire row.  That said, there's a huge amount of luck involved, so while it's great as a starter (or finisher), there's little, if any, meat.

Revised November 2015 from 6 to 7 - it's still a filler game, but it's gotten a lot of play lately, and I'm seeing greater strategy in it.  It would go higher if one's score isn't often dependent on luck of the deal.  Unlike some other card games, there's no way to force out someone or strategize if someone else just got a better deal than you.

I enjoy this card game a lot, but playing with 10P throws all tactics out of the window and it then becomes a sheer luck/drinking game. 

Also played with as few as 2P, which yeah, is tactical, but not as fun since it takes too long for the rows to fill up. 

Therefore I think the perfect number to play 6 nimmt! is 4-6P.

This comes across as kind of a mindless game, and even the direction sheet says something along the lines of, "Think if you want to, but it's really not necessary."  However, it always provides some light-hearted laughter as one person eats the majority of the points, and it takes up to ten people, so it is a good game to own.

I'm surprised at how much I liked this game, and how addictive it is. It feels random but at the same time I've seen players excel at it by a large margin. The tension of trying to stay alive and also set your opponents up for failure is really engaging and fun, and its a bit of push your luck/card counting/number counting game but one that's highly interactive and can be quite mean. But the 'take that' aspect is kind of indirect; it isn't 'haha, I played this super mean card on you that I happened to draw' but rather outbluffing and setting up pitfalls for all of your opponents.

Category 5 version (which my in-laws in hurricane-ravaged Florida thought was a little tasteless). This game is easy to explain, easy to set up and pretty fun to play as a short filler. There is very little skill involved, but if you can figure out what types of numbers are likely going to be played, you can give yourself a little better odds for winning. Best played with 4-6 players. Any less and people are not forced to take many cards. Any more and it is almost entirely a luck-fest on who ends up taking cards.

It's a decent, quick, filler game.  A lot of chaos with a large number of players.  There is a lot of luck involved, but a good tactical player who can recognize when it is the right time to take a hit to avoid a bigger hit or long sequence of smaller hits will tend to win more games than a "duck and cover" player who always tries to avoid taking points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Overall the game is successful at what it is trying to accomplish: a light filler that can be explained in a couple of minutes and played by anyone.

Sometimes I feel like I'm making smart moves by playing a high card at the right time to stick somebody else with a whole row of points, but a lot of times it feels like I just have to play what I've got and hope for the best.

It's fun to play and I wouldn't turn it down, but I just don't know how often I'll play it over similar card games (Linko, Coloretto, Potato Man, Parade).

Numbers game that can be a lot of fun if you don't mind the lack of theme.

Randomness can also be ratcheted up or down by changing the number of cards available to the group.

About [thing=432][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=432][/thing] is an entertaining card game, from Wolfgang Kramer (El Grande, Tikal, etc), in which the goal is to take as few as possible points. Is all about hand management, considering not only the card you want to play, but also what the other players might.

Unlike some of its kind, [thing=432][/thing] seems to work in different ways:
- Up to 3 players: more control, some fun;
- From 4 to 6 players: less control, great deal of fun;
- From 7 to 10 players: enough chaos to kill a bull.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
In every round players are required to pick a card from their hand and put it in a row, accordingly to the closest number of it already at the table - so, if I pick the 37 card and in the table there is a 34 in a row and a 41 in other, I would put the 36 next to the 34, for instance. If the card chosen has a lower value than the last card in all the rows, the player choses one row and take all the cards in it, then adds her own card there, to start a new row.

If the card stacks nicely in the row, while it isn't the 6th in that row, is all good. But if it is the 6th you will take all the cards in the row, except your own just used.

Everyone reveals the card chosen at the same time, and play goes from the lower numbered card to the highest, which can mean that, a row you thought you would add the fourth card in, well, someone added one there first now you are the one adding the sixth card and must take all the other cards in the row! This is also valid in the other way around, as you might thought you are bound to take a row of cards, but someone took it first, and now your cards enters without risk in a row.

Cards have bull icons that go from 1 to 7, and these counts as points at the end of the round (when all cards in the hands are used). Points are tallied and if no one reaches the limit (usually 66 or 100, depending on the amount of time players want to play), play continues. If someone did reach or passed the limit, the game is over, and the player that took the least amount of points is the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which card to play considering the numbers on the rows.

I could add "also considering the cards the other players might play", but this would not be true, except when playing with 10 people, in later rounds if you have enough memory to remember dozens of played cards, in order to count cards, and you still could be wrong, as at least 4 cards will be out of the round (but you could argue to reveal them after dealing the cards). In other words: no. You just can't really know what the others might play, but at least picking one is easier this way, as there is little reason to AP a given choice.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to learn and to play;
- With the simultaneous selection, regardless of the number of players, there is almost zero downtime;
- Accommodates up to 10 players;
- With the 104 cards that the game comes with, is possible to play several other card games;
- Playing time (limit) can be set by the players.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Luck plays a big role and can decide the winner;
- All other bad things derive from the luck factor: risk taking without information (you can pick a card with low chance of risk and ended up screwed, and vice-versa), which makes the game almost be a press-your-luck type;
- Player decisions, though they have weight and matter, are limited by the unknown and the chaotic nature of [thing=432][/thing].

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Just 'chilling. [thing=432][/thing] is an extended filler, one played without worries or even too much thought. You can play while chatting, drinking and not all that concentrated in what is going on - just giving a good look on the cards at the table and picking one from your hand that might work well.

It all works very nicely, and although there is plenty of luck built in the gameplay, [thing=432][/thing] is very light and fun, especially when playing with a high number of players (as there is almost no downtime with the simultaneous choice).

While [thing=432][/thing] might not work with some people, it is more likely to go well with many more. It can appeal to people from different ages and skill levels, going from weekends at grandma's to veteran gaming groups.

I like [thing=432][/thing] and it goes well recommended.

Egy filler game, mely könnyen kitörhet ebből a kategóriából, ha a játékostárs(ak) vevő(k) rá. 
2 játékossal igazi szellemi csata. Figyeljük a másik kijátszott lapjait és ez alapján próbáljuk csőbe húzni. Persze ha feltevésünk téves, - mely szerint azt gondolom, hogy a másik azt gondolja, hogy én azt gondolom...,- akkor könnyen öngólt rúghatunk.
3 játékostól kezdve egyre jobban megy át parti játék kategóriába. Ekkor már sokkal kiszámíthatatlanabb az egész, ilyenkor már gyakorlatilag csak arra érdemes játszani, hogy ne leghátul végezzünk. A játékosszámmal együtt a szerencse szerepe egyre nő, de ezzel a szórakoztató hatása is.

Behåller för att det är en enkel filler som är lätt att förklara och en av mina systrars favoritspel. Och att det går spela många, upp till 10 vilket dock är kaos.

6 Nimmt! is a good game for 3-6 players, that plays quite differently at each of these numbers.  There's a lot more skill, and a lot less chaos, in this game than you might be tempted to believe...

Beyond 6, the game is too chaotic, even for me.

Watch your opponents' body language.

This game is what it is, a filler. The more players, the more chaotic it gets. I like this as a filler but it seems really random and out of control at times. I don't get the sense of being able to control my own choices. Often times, it boils down to just luck. However, this is one of the few games that takes 8 players. So a must keep

I give it a thumbs up, but certainly not my first choice as a filler.

RATING: 7.5
6 Nimmt is a very good, light, chaotic game.  Some of the best features are that the simultaneous card play keeps it fast, the shifting values of the columns keeps you on your toes, and there is still room for some sneaky play.  It makes a top notch filler game.

phantastic quick filler game. You don't have too much influence in this but it is exactly the amount you need to feel like gambling. 
I absolutely love this game, one of my favourite filler games.
You try to lay your cards down at rows and try to not be the one that lays down the sixth card on any row. If you do so, you collect all six cards and get minus points according to the cards you took (bullheads on them)

Easy to teach filler. Cards are played simultaneously and arranged according to number on 4 rows. The player adding the 6th card to a row must collect it along with all of the negative "bull head" points on those cards. Game ends after the hand in which a player busts with 66 points - the player with the lowest score wins (similar to "hearts"). There's a good level of chaos but players that understand the tactics will tend to do better.

This game went pretty quickly from insane fun to insane frustration.  I find myself locked in a love/hate battle now.  It can be so much fun trying to guess the results and watching the chaos that ensues from the reveal... but too often it seems that you're just a victim of the deal.  Get a lot of low and high cards and nothing in the middle and you're pretty much stuck helplessly watching your pile of cards pile up.  Other times it can be an absolute roller coaster of fun.

Updated after the 8th (and 9th) play, the game is good and now it felt that I had much better understanding of what to do.

Thirteenth play, this is a nice filler, not to be taken too seriously. Good game for newbies, too.

Anyway, even playing randomly, you will probably do OK and may not loose." - but if you think this game is just pure luck, I am happy to kick your arse any time.

There are some games that I hate because of the chaos, and then there are other games that I love because of the chaos.  This game falls into the latter category.  I don't think this game is meant to be played strategically, or seriously (though there are certainly tactics that will help you win), but even if you do play that way, I think you'll enjoy the game.  If not for Geschenkt, this would probably hit the table a lot more.

Nice card game. I played quite many times with wrong rules so my take on this might be little twisted.

There are 104 cards numbered from 1 to 104. Every card has at least 1 small flag on it, which will score against you. The deck is shuffled and players are dealt 10 cards each. 4 more are dealt up on the table to form the start of 4 rows.
When each player has chosen a card from their hand, these are revealed and put on the ends of the rows according to simple rules.

As the rows get longer, a row with 5 cards in it is full. If your card is to be the 6th, you pick up the 5 cards in the row, and your 6th card goes to the front to restart the row. The cards you pick up do not go into your hand, but sit in front of you to score against you at the end of the round. Play rounds until someone hits 74 (the minimum speed of a hurricane) and the lowest score wins.

Card game with somewhat classic status. Simultaneous play, and cards are placed in numerical order. If you place sixth card on a line, you get bull's heads as penalty.

RATING: 7
While throwing down a numbered card at random and then organizing it in numerical order with your opponent's played cards sounds like the furthest thing from an interesting game, there is much more to 6 nimmt! than meets the eye. It's not nearly as random as it seems and a good player can spring traps on unwary opponents.

Don't get me wrong, there is still quite a bit of luck involved, but it feels more like pushing your luck than it does just having things happen to you. The only downside is you have to be careful to put everything in the right place when slotting high-value cards, as botching the math will really throw things off kilter. So as long as you have a compulsive organizer in your group, you shouldn't have too much to worry about.

I'll be adding this to my "nightcap" game hall of fame.

RATING: 8
Any explanation of this game to newbies brings a look of anxiety to their face -- which numbers go where? and what kind of strategy is possible? -- but by the end of  the first round, they usually catch on to the ebb and flow of the rows. Yes, some players do well by playing randomly off the top of their decks, but over time such "tactics" usually fail.

RATING: 7
I’ve only played this one once, but I like the general flow of the game and the decisions you have to make. There’s some luck here, but it’s short enough to not matter much and the tension of flipping cards to see who played close enough without being the sixth in line is pretty fun. I feel like this one will be great to bring on family trips.

Recommended.

RATING: 7
Light, enjoyable game which I would put in the same category as "No Thanks" in terms of the "feel" and "flow" of the game.  Easy to learn, some degree of luck due to the randomness of cards, but also fluctuating tactics are required as varying cards come into play.

Such a simple abstract game, but deep enough for strategies to emerge, and those strategies have to change with various player counts. Lots of tactical play too.

Too much randomness. First part of trying to make the optimal play and predicting what players will play and forcing them to not perfect position is ok. But then with taking the rows and gathering "bulls" is too chaotic. I would prefer if you would have to play till you run out of cards (and win) and that you can use the cards that you had to take.

Fun Filler.  Interesting to non-gamers.  There actually is some strategy, but its supposed to be just fun.  It generally succeeds at that if you let it. It's not really as random as people seem to think.  If they can't at least somewhat see what the odds are and what the best play is at the time (besides a random pick from their hand), then I can't see how they are not having some serious problems in other games.  I think they just don't like being screwed by their neighbor. But screwing the other players is the only allure of this game, really.

I love this game as a filler, although we sometimes play it for hours :). It's surprisingly simple and easy to learn, but much more deep once you play it. It's more tactical and anticipating your opponent with few players and more random and fun with a lot of players (bordering to insane with 5+ people). Cool that you can play it with so many people. And it's still quick too! Unique!

Although i haven't tried it yet, you can also play with #players x 10 + the 4 open ones and remove the rest (highest cards), so you know all the cards are in the game, to make it more tactical.

A fun game about numbers that's easy to teach and quick to learn. It has an element of sabotage in it, as well as hand management. To do well, players have to take small losses now to prevent bigger losses later when dealt a bad hand and push all the way when dealt a good hand.

Artwork is simple and game component quality in the form of cards is average. Excellent for the family and for new gamers.

- Chaotic at high player counts

Low strategy due to how random the cards can come out.  However, I do enjoy the chaotic nature of the game.  Fun with a good crowd of people.

For such a simple game, there was a surprising level of strategy. There's a lot of luck in what cards get dealt to you and what doesn't come out of the deck. Given what you have, there are some good decisions to make, but it's light enough that you can't really get upset if you lose.

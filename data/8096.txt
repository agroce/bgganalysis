Rating after one play.  Starting positions trapped all three of my vehicles in the corner of the board.  Never fully rebounded from that.  May give it another try.  Oh yeah, one of the board segments ripped right in half upon straightening...

Traded away.  Not a bad game, but I don't see myself pulling it out again.

The more I play it, the more I like it. You have to balance speed with long-term planning in order to maximize profit.  Add the tension of "will they deliver to my destination before I get there?" and you've got a real winner.

{1 play • 2 player} There are better puzzle-y games, there are better solitaire-y games, and there are better delivery games, but there's only one puzzle-y, solitaire-y, delivery game! It was interesting... but I'm not sure it was fun.  No, not true, I did enjoy it, but I  have no great desire to play again, especially as anything other than a 2-player.

It seemed to me that this is a game where it's more important to set yourself up for the later rounds than to score points early.  It's hard for me to plan that far ahead in my first game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Blah! Didn't grab me. Too much math to go nowhere... literally. It seemed that most of us struggled to stay at the break even point. A few key deliveries in the final 2 rounds resulted in two players with about 15 points (essentially 1 late-game delivery) more than the break-even score. It was especially painful to watch the cube that you wanted get picked up by an opponent because unlike the crayon rail games (where unlimited goods can be had), the territories in Logistico have only one "good" to give. Suddenly your transporter (whatever kind) is left in the void looking foolish (and it probably cost a lot to get to that point)! (1 play, 5 players)  ** Probably better with fewer players. **

RATING: 7.5
This game is great - and tough!  The random nature of the setup here, coupled with the limited ability to move where you'd like has made an overall strategy elusive to us so far.  This is pick-up-and-deliver at its most masochistic.  Because holding goods on vehicles costs, and because moving costs even more, moving goods early is often a losing proposition.  It's possible to get DEEP in a hole in this game, but it is also possible to climb back out - maybe not all the way, but close.  With only a few plays under our belt, my feeling is that you need to be patient, and wait until later turns to deliver... then again, a canny opponent will take advantage of that, and grab stuff first.  If you like logistics games, this is a must-have (duh!).

I like pick-up and deliver games quite a bit, and this is another good one in the genre.  Very simple, but very brain burning trying to figure out the cheapest and most efficient ways to make all of the deliveries.  Getting your three different vehicles in sync is quite a challenge once the initial easy shipments are gone!

Prone to analysis paralysis. Bland graphics. Struck me more like an abstract game, than one about the logistics industry. Being the last player is too great a penalty. I'm disappointed. Doubt this one will get too many plays in our group. I certainly don't want to.

RATING: 8
This game requires alot of coordination.  You really have to think ahead (both for future moves, and for later phases of the current move).  It's very important to make efficient use of all 3 of your vehicles, and passing goods amongst them.  Two of the colors (of wooden bits) are browns, which are very difficult to tell apart.  We play 2-player.  I like the way the pieces put themselves away over the course of play!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While a perfect information game, not a compleat information game in that the deal of bonus cards is both random and private to each player until they are claimed.  Rating may rise to 9 on further plays.  Faint possibility of rising to a 9.5.  Do NOT teach with more than 3 players.  3 players is also fairly clearly the sweet spot for the game due to multiplayer chaos problems.  Exercises some of the same muscles as Age of Steam in terms of route planning and visualisation, but remains a very different and otherwise unrelated game.  Tough, unforgiving, heavily rewards forward planning and risk assessment.  Unlike Age of Steam, is forgiving of first move errors.  Expect some downtime, especially in the mid-game.  Adopt an approach by which players can work out their moves without losing track of where the bits were, or what the costs are.  This sort of explorative move determination can speed and simplify the game. 

Hint: Get your boat away from your truck, and use your boat to collect items which you shuttle to your truck for delivery with the plane.  Think of the three transports as a sort of sweeping arm which moves across the board, one end picking up, the other end delivering.  Work on building a queue of deliveries in such a way that the reward for intercepting that queue exceed's other's costs.  Selective defense of cubes by storing them on your transports will likely be needed.  Be careful here in calculating cost deltas.

Despite the early warnings from reviewers, I've only had one game in which a player ended the game with less points than they started with.  In fact final scores seem to be growing.  We've had several games with scores well over 100, and even games where all players ended the game with 100+.

Logistico is so dry! This ordinarily doesn't bother me (and 'dryness' is sometimes a bonus), but this time it didn't quite work.

Players in Logistico are competing to deliver colored cubes from Point A to Point B, with the primary limiting factor that there are only four potential Point Bs for any given Point A, and this number can and will diminish rapidly.  The structure of the game is such that increasingly complex operations (read: more action points) are available to players as the game goes on.  This makes some intuitive sense, as 'easy' deliveries are most likely to be available at the beginning of the game, and more difficult operations won't be required until later.

In practice, what happens is easy deliveries are more-or-less no-brainers.  Even if one wanted to try more complex operations, the functional action point allowance is so small in the early going that one will have a very difficult time doing so.  Then, in the second half of the game, any good A has maybe only two (or sometimes one) potential destinations.  Getting that good there requires some fancy logistical footwork, but the game really just sits there, dead, as each player counts the steps and determines his best short-term move.  At no point did I feel I made any really interesting decisions--I just manually pruned the decision tree until there was only one choice left.

All this, plus the absurd turn-order rules (simply put, there are none).  The designer pleads his case in the forums here, claiming that the person going last has an advantage because he can 'react' to what other people are doing.  What?!?!  When you go last in Logistico, the only 'reactions' to someone else's move are happiness that nobody took your cube, or sadness that somebody did.  Those 'reactions' aren't really adequate compensation for being at a persistent disadvantage.

Despite my issues with the game, I'm actually kind of fond of it and am eager to play it more.  I like logistical puzzles, even though I can be bad at them.  Logistico has enough going for it (namely, a really slick set of transport rules) that I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.  To wit: It's entirely possible that better players can find room within the strict action point system to allow for more complex maneuvers, opening up the game a little and adding a strategic layer to the game that I do believe is there.  I just can't see it yet.

I found this to be a great game. As it turns out we learned another game the same night. Hansa which as it turns out has some similarities. They are both pick up and delivery games for points or cash. I found logistico to be the deeper game by a fair margin. To me its also the better game by a fair margin. In logistico you have to look 2 or 3 turns ahead 4 if you can manage it. It also has a most interesting thing I don't believe I've seen before which is a sliding scale of costs per action point used 1=1 2=2 3=4 4=6 5=9 6=12 7=16 8=20. This makes it possible to perform up to 8 actions with one unit ( You only have 3 a boat a plane and a truck.) However the costs become prohibitively expensive. You start out with 40 points/gold/cash and for the first half of the game due to greed most people were actually losing money. The final scores were 67, 62, 49. and less than 40 which I thought was utterly fascinating. You have to watch your spending very carefully and avoid the temptation to rush ahead of someone trying to scoop them on a delivery only to lose money. Played this again and while it was still interesting it isn't as fascinating once you figure out the best playing style. Traded for Price of Freedom.

Production: Attractive board, functional despite the irregular shapes of the territories.  Nice wooden cubes and transports.  Sub-standard mission cards.  Play: Clever mechanism by which a player must use one's points to gain more points, thus forcing players to maximize their profits through careful coordination between their transports.  True to its name, this game rewards careful, though perhaps conservative calculation.  Each game's fresh setup creates an interesting network of scoring opportunities. (2 1 3) (4 plays)

Pick up and deliver, each player using a plane, boat, and truck. Goods are strewn out among five different islands, with demand randomly spread across those same islands. Use your three forms of transportation (all with different movement capabilities) to deliver goods. Goods delivered earn a player $, but movement (essentially actions) cost an increasing amount of money the more one takes in a given turn. Want to make a big delivery?--then pay big for it. Otherwise, slow down and take two or more turns to complete it. The catch is ending a turn with goods on your ships costs you money as well. No problem, you think, I'll just drop it off in this region and pick it up again on my next turn. Did I mention this game is cutthroat? Yeah, well, another player will swoop in, drive in, or boat in and steal that good from you. Only, it's not stealing, because it never was yours to begin with. 

The other interesting part of the game is that the payout for delivering goods gradually increases as the game progresses. True to its Euro characteristics, this is balanced, because all the good, efficient deliveries are snatched up early in the game, leaving the shitty ones left at the end--so they had *better* pay out big. 

Nice wooden components and pleasing to look at. Can be a bit AP inducing with certain players. Beware!

An excellent game of pick up and deliver the goods.  It is best with two players, and three players is the maximum that the game still remains playable.

Players own a truck, boat and plane, and must use them as cost effectively as possible to deliver goods to destinations for profitable payoffs.  Goods cubes and demand disks are scattered over an archipelago at the beginning of the game.  Players load the goods onto their transporters, move them to the demand chips, and collect a payoff.  However, loading, moving, and even storing goods between turns costs money, so doing it quickly helps.  The payoffs accelerate nicely throughout the game, allowing for some catch-up plays.  Very elegant game.

I don't like the random card deal - some people wind up with a better deal than others. If someone starts out near a destination early on, you may be stuck with a mostly-useless card. Otherwise, a neat game. Hard to wrap my head around. Setting up for a big last few turns is really important.

Very challenging game. Very challenging. Did I say very challenging? Steep learning curve before you figure out how to make your boat, plane and truck work together. Although abstract, the challenging nature of the game draws you into it. Too bad the game has a major drawback: the random distribution of the vehicles, the goods and delivery points and the special delivery locations can highly benefit or thoroughly hose a player without recourse.

Not exciting. There is something here, but not much beyond a good pick-up & deliver game. The fact that the first player doesn't change is a weakness. I think that rotating or auctioning or any mechanism to move turn order would make a significant improvement. Gamers will like Logistico, it works, but it's not a family game. Nice bits. Odd to choose 2 browns when red/orange weren't used.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game with interesting challenges that has several available strategies.  I think one rule that can easily be overlooked but shouldn't is the fact that you can keep cubes on your vehicules for the next turn.  The downside is the cost, but since the 3 cost is actually just one more than if you had unloaded and reloaded it the turn before, this is not a major cost.  Especially if you had moved a long path before.  The increasing costs for transport and the scaling of the prices for delivery makes for a good puzzle to solve.  Definitely not a game to play with AP prone opponents, but interesting enough to want to replay right away.

RATING: 8
Logistico is pick-up-and-deliver in its raw form. There is supply, there is demand, and you need to use your boat, plane, and truck to bring both together. Operating those vehicles costs money, though, and you always need to keep an eye on profitability.

In some ways the game is similar to Age of Steam. You need to map out your deliveries in advance and carefully position your vehicles. Snatching cubes from unsuspecting opponents is more common since the more free-form movement makes it harder to protect cubes. Since the supply cubes, once used up, do not regenerate making sure you still have long-term delivery options also works very differently, and early errors are not punished as harshly.

Earlier design from Cornel van Moorsel. It shows its age but I believe the design can be improved with cleaner mechanisms. I really like how the different methods of transportation work and how the hold different amounts of cargo. The thing I dislike the most is that the turn order never changes and the first player has an advantage. As I said I appreciate the many clever aspects this game offers but it can be improved to reach greatness.

One of the players ended up with less points than she started with, and that can surely be frustrating.

Can't see this being much fun with four or five players (too much chaos for a game that's all about careful planning and precise calculation), but with two it's a nice little nut to crack.  The amount of information to analyze in the initial board layout is overwhelming, so the early game consists mostly of tactical moves for small gains (or sometimes losses).  Once the goods on the board thin out a bit, it's possible to look further ahead and make some strategic decisions about where to position your truck and boat for the big payoffs in the latter half of the game.

This game deserves credits for being so different from so many others, yet based on a simple design. The brain-burning aspect didn't seem so overwhelming, as I managed not to pressure myself to "always look for the optimal move". The game aided me in this regard by always providing many alternative courses of action, and by limiting the amount of "screwage" that other players could do. The game might not be "great" compared to many others out there, but I could play this any time when I look for something more creative than a puzzle to devote my time on.

Based on 2 plays with 5 players and all 5 were new to the game. With 5 the starting position of the boat and the truck is a to0 big of a luckfactor. Second game we altered the rules, by playing the turnorder à la Puerto Rico and idea's coming up like, starting position determined by the players self à la Catan (but which vehicle first, the boat or the truck? The plain isn't bothersome of a starting-position-problem). Maybe the posibility of loading the truck on the plain. Maybe letting the map not being an archipel but a globe, so ships can "leave" on an edge and "enter" on the other side of the map. As you can see i have my doubts about the rules. The idea of the game is great, in practice (at least with 5 players) it doesn't.

Played it first time yesterday with three. I did enjoy it - at least the way I played it. Not as much of analysis - rather from the belly. I lost horrible. So it was interesting to play, but there are some factors I dislike: the random placement of goods, demands and vehicles can be imho a way to decisively. At least in our games I started as third and on an uninteresting island with no quick wins and was arrear from the beginning to the end. And finally I dislike randomless analysis games. Although I did like the basic mechanics - sounds odd?

A fun little pickup and deliver game, without the overhead of building the infrastructure first (as in Age of Steam etc.). The plane is probably the least useful mode of transport, but you can leave it idle without penalty if you want to. Some luck in the initial early deliveries, but it's the late deliveries that decide the game. A good example of gaming minimalism.

Logistico is a transportation game. A player who delivers more effectively is going to be a winner. The game successfully shows transportation system. According to the delivery situation, the distribution costs will be reduced or increased. The game rule is very clear and the game progress is also simple. Logistico removed all of inconvenient details without pick-up and deliver mechanics. In my opinion, this game is a very good introduction of pick-up and delivery game. By the way, the game is only dealing with transportation, so that Logistico provides tasteless feeling during playing game. The game is good, but it was not my taste.

Lack of turn order destroys those late in the turn order in a 5 player game.  They just are always one step behind.

Airplane is useless in all but the first player's very first turn, assuming there is an easy pickup delivery with the plane.  In a 5 player game, beyond the afore mentioned first player easy delivery, only one time was a plane moved to coordinate a delivery.  I'd call that a big waste.

I won, and didn't really feel that fullfilled.  I won because I got 2 of my special deliveries, and that was it alone.

Very interesting pick-up-and-delivery game; seems to reward repeated plays to get a feel for optimizing routes and coordination between ships, planes, and trucks. I have a couple of quibbles with the starting set-up, however. I dislike the fact that players have no control over where their pieces begin the game. It is quite possible to have a starting position that places you at a significant disadvantage. While this does not doom a player to failure, it certainly requires him/her to be much more efficient in the mid-game to have any chance of victory. The random setup also makes delivering to your bonus sites much more of a crapshoot. Depending upon the distribution of goods and demand markers, and your initial setup, you may not have the chance to score the bonus before the demand marker is removed by a opponent.

I like this game the more I play it. Planning your deliveries and pick-ups is crucial. As is having an idea of what you want to do once you begin to drop of your goods. After about a dozen plays I haven't seen a seat advantage. But I have seen a skill advantage. It's all about making the most on each delivery(faster isn't always better).

Logistico is not a difficult game to describe. You take a set of color coded goods cubes and demand discs, and randomly distribute them on the board. Each player gets a ship, a plane, and a truck. You try to make efficient deliveries. The more actions you spend, the less money you make. If you cannot complete a delivery in one turn, you pay a small penalty for your undelivered goods. Each player also has a few cards that give them extra incentives for a few specific deliveries. 

This game feels like a conceptual overview for "pick-up and deliver." Not bad. Not very exciting or engaging either. I like the plane/truck/boat pieces. Otherwise I'd probably give a 5 just for general blandness. Could be interesting to fans of the genre. 

Update: I've thought about it more, and I have to agree with Jason Matthews, who says that "the fun part, intermodal transport, is not how you win." I would modify it slightly to say that the fun part feels far too constrained.

Is it "pickup and deliver" heaven?  Well, yes to some degree, but that's not
all a good thing.  What it provides is a thoughtful and elegant simulation,
but at the cost of delivering something suitably "gamerly".  Mike expected
I'd like the game - that it's "my type of game" (I especially like economic
games), and it is.  However, so much has transpired in the world of gaming,
that I more readily see its faults.  Each turn seems more like "problem
solving" than like "gaming".  "Hmmm.  Where are my vehicles?  How much will
it cost to move them to suitable places for complete deliveries, and at what
point does the marginal cost exceed the marginal revenue?"

Strong 7/10 with tendency towards 8 after first play. Having a job involving logistics this game hits the sweet spot. Finding the right long-term route and optimizing the deliveries tactically is a challenge I enjoy. Too bad that it will be to dry for the taste of most players. Playing with 4 or even 5 players will make planning more and more obsolete though. I wouldn't play it with 5 players. The disadvantage of being later in turn order should get some compensation.

I really like the mechanics and the deducing of deliveries using all three of your vehicles.  However, there's several things I'm not keen about, and if the game isn't broken then it has a steep learning curve and doesn't seem fun for me to play.  It's too much analysis paralysis for me and thus I'd much prefer to play any of the various varieties of Age of Steam.....

This is one very tight game money wise.  I will have to investigate further to figure out how to end up with more money than what I started the game for future plays.  The concept of the game is interesting in trying to blend the use of three different vehicles to facilitate deliveries of goods.  Plays very well with two players - I'd rate the game an 8 with two.

Very dry and mathematical. The gameplay is good though. My biggest complain is the lack of polished of the component : why not have a name per country (like they used in Ticket to Ride).

With a title that aptly foreshadows its uncompromising focus on getting stuff from here to there, foregoing any story, background or chainsaw-wielding road warriors, Logistico manages both to boil down the traveling salesman problem to a neat, elegant game and to add a lovably new aspect to it: the aeroplane. While your boat and truck can trundle anywhere, they are painfully slow, so you need to boost them with the continent-hopping plane that, alas, can only go to airports. Ideally, your slow vehicles collect and deliver on a single continent each and use the plane to exchange their product. Almost like life ... I love it when a game can squeeze the endless complexities of the real world into a tiny and simple model that nevertheless manages to reward the same kind of patterns and decisions that would be optimal in reality.

With a fixed amount of produce and demand on the map and ever-escalating rewards for getting one to the other, the game has a nice dynamic where the early, easy routes pay less well and the few and difficult connections that are left at the end reap huge rewards. All in all, very recommended if event cards or MGs on your truck are not a necessity for you.

I believe this would be much better without the random bonus cards (or if the bonus was the same no matter which round of play it was collected on), since there is very little control over the targets still being in place later in the game.  It just added too much randomness for me.

A thinky little logistics game.  The production quality isn't great, but there is good depth to this.  You will always be trying to find the most efficient way to move goods.  The rule that you get more points for deliveries later in the game is brilliant, as it levels out the luck of initial placement.

I like several of this van Moorsel fellow's games, especially [i]Factory Fun[/i] and [i]Streetsoccer[/i], with [i]Logistico[/i] running a not so distant third. First of all, it works nicely as a solo puzzle, always a nice bonus (see Nick Danger's variant). The two-player game is an exercise in simultaneous-solitaire for the most part, but quite fun. With three, the players start stepping on each other's toes, a good thing, making the game more of a race for choice goods and delivery locations. This becomes more extreme with four players, perhaps to the game's detriment: it's harder to plan and execute those clever combination moves involving two or even all three of your vehicles, which make the game so enjoyable. Five players? Yikes! [22 plays]

Dry strategic game where players try to minimize cost and maximize profit. You move goods to customers by ship, plane, and truck that cost to use. At the end of the turn, you pay for goods in transit. Not a bad game, but not super interesting, albeit a nice mental challenge.

Low player interaction without confrontation.

RATING: 6.5
Slight abstract game where players make deliveries of goods with boats, trains and planes. Payoffs for goods are increasing as the game goes on, and actions cost more as you do more per turn. The slight abstract, low interaction of it may have left me and the gaming group lukewarm but it is okay. We talked about the advantage of the player order (first players appear to have an advantage as following players could get left with their refuse). Opinion only based on one play, however.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
3p game of [thing=8096][/thing], new to all players.

There's clearly at LEAST the seed of a really good game here.  Abstract map starts with a good cube and a demand marker (4 each of 9 colors for each) on all locations.  Players each own a boat, an airplane, and a truck that they use to try to move cubes to matching demand markers.  Goods and demand disappear from the game permanently as deliveries are made, and are never restocked.

Players pay more the more each transporter moves, and pay extra if they hold on to goods between turns.  Payoffs for deliveries get better as the game progresses.  Most money wins.  A lot of the cost-benefit is in the sweet spot of decisions being nontrivial.  

Players start with $40 apiece, and our final scores were IIRC 93-65-39.  I eventually won, and it seems that I was the first to get into a groove of using the boat to load the plane and the plane to drop on the truck and the truck to make deliveries.

A perceived oddity of the system is that the start player remains the same for the entire game.  In this first play, that really seemed to parlay into an advantage.  As it happens, the scores map to turn order.  It's quite possible that while this is asymmetric, it is not unbalanced, but it's unlikely my group will play this enough to learn to autobalance it through play.

My 5 rating is more of a no opinion right now as we didn't complete a full game of this yet. Others have mentioned that it takes several games before you actually "get it" so I will respect that. I will say, though, that this may not be the game for me (or my group). My color-blindness was assaulted by the terrible color selections that were made for the discs and cubes, and the downtime while someone calculates every possible move (not only for this turn but for 10 turns down the road) will be sure to drive me insane. I also don't see much chance for clever play - as I said, though, I am sure that my unfamiliarity with the game is to blame... at least I'm hoping. More to come as I try and convince my group to play this again... ***UPDATE*** I was right... now that I "get" the game I don't like it. The first hurdle of fighting the colors is bad enough, but to really do well, you need to analyze your move carefully - something I don't enjoy and I'm not willing to do. Now, I always try and make the best move I can, but I like to play games instinctively. Any more than 20 or 30 seconds per move strikes me as overly analytical. I also don't count cards in games. I have the ability to do these things but if I'm going to put this much effort into something, I better be reaping a financial return at the end! Sorry but I'll take a pass on Logistico.

RATING: 6
A complicated puzzle of a pick up and deliver game. Since it's so hard to make a profit, you often want to spend one turn positioning your units, then make a shipment in one turn, so you don't have to carry the goods for multiple turns. It's very dependent on where you start and how the goods tokens are arranged. It's good if you can have the plane just ferry items between your boat and truck, to complete shipments quickly.

Overall, an interesting, well designed game.  One complaint that sometimes comes up is thatit seems like you need one more truck to make the airplane work properly.

Played several times.  I like it a lot, but it's a real brain workout.  Especially in the beginning, where the possible choices are almost overwhelming.  I think I prefer to play with an 'optimally randomized' setup, where we try to keep the colours distributed evenly across the board - keeps the game a little more symmetric and punishes a poor start position less.

Also: NEVER, EVER play this game with 5.  It simply doesn't work.  2 or 3 players and this is an outstanding game.  4 and it's chaotic but fun, 5 and it's awful - simply too much randomness to let you do any planning; you have to wait for your turn and hope there's something left to do that won't cripple you.

I love pick up and deliver games - crayon rails, roads & boats, age of steam. And this brings another a nice twist on the genre to the table. Do the easy deliveries first. Then start thinking long term where you want your boat and truck to be a few turns on as the easy deliveries disappear. Then have your boat, plane and truck all work in unison, gradually migrating around the countryside delivering. Oh, and watch out for being scooped by the competition. Which reminds me, after the first play, we instantly moved to having the start player rotate each turn. As most turns end after a delivery has been made (extra actions get more expensive, and you don't want to hold onto cubes due to holding costs), it seems grossly unfair that the start player remains unchanged, so they'll always be the one every turn who gets to out-scoop everyone else on pickups first next turn - the poor old player going last would have to incur holding costs each turn so as not to get out-scooped. Anyway, easily fixed. I've enjoyed. Not sure I want to play with more than 3 players (downtime, too much scooping), and I'm not sure whether this one might dry up after a while (see notes on little cubes at top), but I like it.

RATING: 6
What I like:
- Creative pickup-and-deliver game
- Several counter-intuitive aspects are intriguing
- 4p learning game only took 60 minutes

What I don't like:
- It's a bit thinkier than I normally like
- Might be prone to AP, especially with no randomness after setup
- The bonus cards are on crappy stock, but at least you don't handle them much
- It felt like we were barely breaking even most of the first game

I enjoy most pickup-and-deliver games, but this one isn't my favorite. The storage costs and almost triangular action costs, combined with steadily increasing payoffs for delivery create many situations where you have to forget what you may have learned in other games.

The art on the board is nice. I wish they wouldn't have used light brown and dark brown as 2 of the goods colors.

We all came away from our first game thinking about what we would do differently when we play again.

RATING: 7
Quite good. Subsequent plays will reveal if its got legs.  A 2p didnt seem like it had enough competition, but on the other hand some of those deliveries were really tough and expensive.  A lot more complex than I gave it at first blush.

A good game for the Lucky Lab pub night. Relatively small footprint/fairly easy explanation/sleeved cards means the game is fairly rugged.  Might be a good mediumish-gateway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on one play: As a five player game, this game has some problems. The start player never changes and the starting positions are drawn at random, leading to a lot of luck of first placement and turn order. Also, since there are a lot of players, it never makes it to the bottom few rounds where your longer deliveries, that took you several turns to do, pay off. Should be better with less players, but still, not the most interesting game.

Another great one from cwali! 

Simple rules (3 or 4 pages), good components and brain burning depth. You really have to use your brain to plan your moves and coordinate your deliveries properly. 

There's a definite learning curve and things can be a bit tough to the first timers. It's also quite abstract and dry as the desert wind, so it can scare away some players. 

But for those who don't mind the dryness and have the determination to overcome the learning curve, it's really a cool brain burner!

RATING: 4
Simple idea but as a game this one is worthless.
I hate the idea that first everybody move their ferry, then boat and finally truck. This limitation really handicappes the game!
Usually the player who had the best place at first will win and the last player in turn order will lose. This is the basic rule I discovered...
Well, it's not totally like that, but that's how it felt.

Increasing profit is a nice reason to delay some deliveries. It's too expensive to go from a continent to another with truck - which is your primary way of getting things into their destinations. The airplane is totally useless after the first two-three rounds.

At the end, nobody really wanted to do anything because everything was so far away, so they'd get no profit of delivering the goods.
Logistics are a good genre, but this game ashames that whole genre.

Played 1.5 games with a friend. It is sure a brain burner game. Every move need to consider a lot and calculate the profit since the income has changed in each turn.

October 2016: Downgrade from 7 to 6. Played at 5 again and was a much, much better experience. But this game is really showing its age. I love the logistical puzzle the game offers on each turn. But considering the downtime in this game, I think the game should actually have *more* mechanisms thrown at it like current Euros (from the mid-2000s!) as the logistical puzzles get a bit samey after awhile.

May 2008: There's something really, really weird with the five player game. For this many players, I think you have to move very little (i.e. don't make any deliveries) early in the game so that all those long haul deliveries will make you a profit. If I'm right (and manage to get my gaming group to play another game -- which I think is unlikely because of the bad first impression this game gets with five players) the rating of this one might drop; I don't like having to do barely nothing during any of my turns.

Still, I love the concept of the game! It's rare to see Euros in which you get to move pieces around.

Transportations with everything but the trains (boats, trucks, and planes).  Lots of interesting, difficult, and tight decisions.  However, it seems like initial random chance (starting location and turn order) and direction of conflict (direct competition or lack thereof) have a bigger factor than all strategic and tactical decisions.  Even with 3, there seems little real chance of true logistic coordination.  Still, it has a lot of potential.

Even though you know the order (Boats, Planes, Trucks) it is alway tough to keep things in line especially whey you want to move your trucks first.  I really think that those that figure out the best way to overload you boats and planes efficiently is going to cream all other contenders.  Sadly, I have a hard time timing everything.  

Regardless, this is a nice compelling system.  My only complaint about the game is the turn order.  I know the game author swears that the last place player has an advantage, I just don't see it.  We play where the player in last gets to start.

1 play, 3er, all new.

Ugh! So dry, so boring! It is pick-up-and-deliver, with nothing to make it more interesting. And are the planes good for anything? After all that I had heard, I'd expected more -- need to try it again with experienced players to see how it is supposed to be played well!

Have only played once with two, but it is very dry and has enough downtime even with just two.  It is like a puzzle in a sense, which can be interesting.  However, performing intense calculations for such an extended time without a satisfying payoff can grow a bit tiresome after a while, plus it lends itself to the dreaded "analysis paralysis."  To be fair, I may enjoy it more upon further playings, although I won't be the one suggesting it hit the table.  Update:  played with five and liked it slightly better, maybe because there's more time to plan out your move while your opponents play.

It's a bit too dry and mechanical and also the board and the components don't help players at all. It still has some nice, simple and clever ideas. I like it.

Ack, this is a game? Setting Robo Rally aside, this was one of the worst gaming experiences of my life. I wonder whether we did something wrong, as it seemed so utterly pointless to me. Again, Corné van Moorsel tries to blend several mechanics together in a game. Most of his efforts are near misses with the occasional hit, but this isn't even close. A puzzle exercise, and a very boring one. I would need some serious bribing to play this again.

Early rating after just one play.  I liked it!  In our three-player game, the start player and the third player lost by about 50 points to the second player.  So obviously there&#039;s a big second-player advantage.  :0)

No player-turn rotation kills this game!  Plus, the game is not even playable with 4-5 players.  Elevate to 7 rating with 3 players and turn rotation.

Pretty much classic example of a game with one brilliant mechanic but somewhere along the way in development not enough stuff was added to make the game live up to this. Theres a tedious opening game which not only feels non intuitive because you lose money on deliveries but it just doesnt seem thematic to pick up these easy deliveries and start cleaning up spaces. The costs of moving the boat, truck and plane are apparently the same and probably much development should have been done to make this more interesting, strategic and thematic. The idea of having the same person going first as well as the same order of vehicles also violate so many game designs concepts...why the hell not let each player go first? That seems obvious, and more fair and even more challenging. Its just a madness decision which must have something to do with the designer feeling the game would break. That seems to be it in a nutshell. Ditto with the ever increasing profit margins, the hidden goals, etc. I cant wait to play it again though as the concept of boat, air and land is fascinating. I wish the game was more thinky and more fair like Container...ugh not disappointed just fascinated by what this game should be....9/27/16

Played only once in three. It seems to be a game that require a kind of strategy to let you enjoy. If you play in a way probably you don't like it and maybe my case. It left me confused with all these colors and a doubt about pick & delivery frequency. In all the game I didn't see a boat with more than two goods. May be in the future I'll change my comment... may be.

A really neat pick up and deliver game that would likely play quicker the more people that are playing.  Pure strategy, and a little bit of brain burn.  I would avoid it with AP prone people though, as it could turn into a long game, and needlessly so.

This is a very nice game with nice components. A lot of tough decisions and strategies. But it is not for casual gamers. If your level is "Settlers of Catan", this is not a game for you. If you like games like "Hansa", then you will like this one. It takes a couple of games to figure out certain mechanisms, and probably this is the appeal to play it one more time and optimize your strategy.

Hard game. In a 3p solo game only one player made a (small!) profit despite me never consciously making any deliveries that would not be profitable. There is not even loan interest here to blame.

The early game random setup is very hard to quickly study and make plans for, reminiscent of AoS. It gets easier as deliveries start sucking both supply and demand off the board.

As a multiplayer game this leaves something to be desired. The interaction takes the form of occasionally taking on a delivery that perhaps another player had already been preparing to take on themselves. For me it is just too much to be expected to both parse the situation on the map and also prepare for what other players might decide to do.

So, I think this could be better as a solitaire experience. However, in that case, I wonder if the randomness of the initial setup is high enough that one can't get a very consistent measure of one's skill via one's end score. Really unsure about that.

Despite the chaos, I found a lot to like in this game.  Like Age of Steam, the gameplay develops out of the way the connections are made, and who can get to them first.  It requires a lot of math, and I can see this causing a lot of problems for players who are prone to AP or min-maxing.

Played once (with 4 players). A game based on interesting ideas, but which seems to suffer from some drawbacks in the way they are put to use. Playing first is an advantage, the secret cards add some unpleasant randomness, and the initial starting positions can be terribly unbalanced. However, the game itself plays quite well (despite possible analysis-paralysis problems) and is shorter as I would have expected.

Fascinating. My head is mind is still melt down after the first playing. I sucked but the game did not. I had no idea whatsoever how to make profitable moves but I liked the pieces and mechanics anyway.

Nettes Strategiespiel, aber ich glaubeich würde es nicht oft genug spielen, so dass es nur die Note 6 bekommt. Mit Basketball hat es nur in sofern etwas zu tun, dass man ein team aus 5 Leuten hat. Man hätte das ganze auch mit Handball, Eishockey, etc aufziehen können. Aber schlecht ist es deshalb nicht.

RATING: 5
+ Kinda like fantasy basketball in a board game.
- But without any hidden information; Just boils down to a bland auction game.


Why it's previously-owned:
There are many other games that include auctions, but have much more going for them.  This game is really too much of a one-trick pony (and that one trick isn't elegant in the way that Ra is).
I gave this game away to a friend who seemed to enjoy it a lot the couple times we played.  When we want an auction game, we pull out Strasbourg instead.

RATING: 7
Nice, simple sports management game built around a series of auctions.  Hardcore sports sim fans will miss the plethora of player stats or any real feel of the sport itself; it could be converted to five-a-side football with only cosmetic changes.  

Nonetheless Basketboss has some clever mechanics, it plays nicely, and there are some tense auctions. It also presents alternative strategies around timing, money and the use of specialists like the Coach and the Agent.

In this game you are the manager of a basketbal team. Or at least that's what they want you to feel. In reality the theme is very much pasted on. In essence the game boils down to a single bidding phase every turn. The rest of the game is just bookkeeping. Still it is a low level complexity game which could interest basketbal fans. I think it's just a nice family game which I will enjoy for a while.

Seems the game has more staying power than I originally thought. It does not hit the table that often. But it has been receiving steady plays for over 2 years now. And when it does hit the table we always have fun.

Sports management is a unique theme for sure, and I like the way this game somewhat emulates the mechanisms of Hollywood Blockbuster. The silly names of the players are hilarious, and help with the funny theme. I also enjoy the balancing act of trying to get players who play well and players who earn money for your team. Where the game falls apart for me is the fact that they dropped the ball (pun intended) on the theme. The "season" is simply the best group of players wins, and that's it. It literally lasts less than 5 seconds, and this seems so wrong to me. Obviously I don't want a game where you play out 82 basketball games one by one, but the way this game handles it just feels so anticlimactic. "Last player is drafted? OK, you win the season, you come in second, and I’m third." Blah! Perhaps it is just the promise of the theme and what I personally expect from a game with that type of thematic setup. Aside from that the mechanisms are really interesting and the added helpers that players can grab each turn throw in a nice twist to the game. Now that my expectations have been adjusted I'm sure I can manage to enjoy this game, but for a first play this was a significant letdown.

Considerably better than I expected from reading the rules.  I don't tend to be a fan of auction-heavy games, but this one has enough options that it's still enjoyable.

RATING: 6
A pretty decent super filler auction game.  Players are building teams of players, whose awesomeness varies from season to season.  If you add a rookie to your team, he might suck for the first couple seasons and bring it on later in his career, while a season veteran may only have a couple great seasons in him before he becomes a drain on your team.

You basically just bid on players each turn, with trophies awarded for the strongest team each turn.  So, you have to try winning the current season while also planning future talent for later seasons.  There are a few other special things that add to the fun, such as injuries and the ability to hire an agent, bribe a ref, hire a coach, etc, each granting you a temporary ability.

Overall, a good game if you like a well-themed and fairly quick auction game.

Picked it up at Essen on Thursday, just finished playing a 5-player game on Friday.

I'd call it a nicely designed family game.
Funny and colourful components, all within the realm of the basketballworld.
The core of the game is bidding for players who will make your team better instantly or within a few years. They also give you income so you have to make sure you get the balance in your team straight to win some big cups over the 6 seasons.

RATING: 8
I'm not generally a fan of sports games.  However, Basketboss is an exception.  I like the strategic element of building a team and managing it over six seasons.  There's a lot more strategy than one might suspect at first glance.  You're balancing money (which is very tight) against the different types (colors/positions) of player, and their annual expected production.  The hiring of "experts" (trainer, agent, referee, banker) are an effective, but not intrusive catch-up mechanism.

I find it hard to get this one to the table with our group, but when I do, it's always a good time.

John Weber roped me into this one. The theme had two strikes against it right off the bat. It's a moderately interesting Euro, but the last round pretty much decides everything since that is effectively scored twice. I won the game I played but didn't enjoy it much.

Surprisingly short and tight, it's slightly fiddly for what it is, but enjoyable. More of asset management than sports sim, the game has elements that don't relate to theme (the colour diversity) and clumsy rules, but it still a good gamers' game. Will play again, but not high on my list.

BasketBoss is a light pure bidding game. You draft players for your team in order to win the championship. Players, of course, have different strengths, and also (deterministically) develop those over time (some get better, others get worse, yet others are just wildly inconsistent). At the end of a season the strongest team wins the cup, and thus victory points.

There is really nothing wrong with the game but the competition as far as light auction games go is rather fierce, and there are better offers on the market for this position.

A fairly simple game in execution, but so much fun if you like the idea of being a GM trying to get the best players possible without breaking the budget.  Simple auctions with a few little twists, including each player getting a special ability each turn (or a 1 pt "participation" medal).  The growth and decline of your players is clever and fun to manage.  The game moves at a steady clip, and the auctions mean that everyone is engaged throughout.  I will never turn down a game.  THE game to play during March Madness!

BasketBoss is a quick and succinct auction game where you're bidding on free agent basketball players, and adding them to your team.  You just have a starting five, and there's a bonus point available for each position represented. So SG-SG-SG-C-C gets +2 added to its overall strength, while a more balanced PG-SG-SF-PF-C gets +5.  Some players aren't very good at first, but improve dramatically in future seasons.  Some drop off quickly, and may only have a year or two of effectiveness.  Other players are consistent from year to year.

The game reminds me somewhat of the previous Cwali game ZooSim (O Zoo le Mio), in the way that you have to master the pace of your acquisitions.  Both games allow you to win multiple auctions in a turn, and in both games your acquisitions affect your income for the next turn.  The big difference is that this is typical around the table bidding rather than the blind bidding used in ZooSim.

As a sports fan, I enjoy the basketball theme.  But any bonus point I might be tempted to give for the theme would be immediately countered by a penalty point for the game's awkward, ugly artwork.

RATING: 6.5
Almost pure auction game, with the interesting twist of items varying in value after you acquire them - that is, the basketball players get better or worse each round, in the way the game simulates their talent, consistency and aging. You win trophies each season according to the current strength of your team in relation to your opponents', and these trophies are converted into victory points at the end of the game. Possible balance issues with the special characters that are chosen each round (the agent, in particular, seems overpowered). There is not too much luck, except perhaps in blind bidding to avoid injuries, but that only occurs twice, at most. All in all, a worthwhile and clever medium-weight game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's a light bidding game.  When thinking about it for a response here, I started to think 'how would I describe it'.  Well, an image of Hollywood Blockbuster came to mind.  But, it's really not that.

So, it's just 6 rounds (maybe it was 7).

You have a round of bidding for players.

Those players do two things:

Add to the strength of your team and/or
bring money into your team

Each round you you gain trophies based on the strength of your team and then earn income off your team for the following round.

You can only have up to 5 players on your team, so you are looking to 'hire' players that improve your team.

Each player 'changes' their 'strength each year (some getting better as they mature, some losing some of their strength as they age and I think there were a couple that were inconsistent).  But, income stays the same.

One neat thing is that there are two injuries 'tiles' that come up.  When those go up for bid, it's a fist in blind bid.  All bids are spent ('on health care for the team') and the one that spends the least on their team gets an injured player for the year.

On initial play I'd rate it between a 7 and 8.  But, I've found myself actively trying to get it to the table.  I don't always do that with new games.  Also, it does have some of the same feel as HB to me and I've got that rated a 9.  So, it will probably be an 8 (maybe a 9).

What may stop it though, at the end of each round there is a 'selection' round for 'specialists' for your team.  They aren't equally powerful and the way it works is a bit wonky.  I've been meaning the research that and see if it's a translation problem.

Was curious to see how they implemented sports' management in a game, as it is a game design grail of mine.  Bland auction game with open information, with basketball barely present (finished drafting players?  Best team wins the season!)

The one interesting element is the players progression through time, with some players starting slow and getting better, some having one good season, and so on.  There might be something to build on this, but it is not in this game.

I enjoy Cwali games so I was hoping this one would be good enough to warrant a purchase at the Spiel 2009 to get the expansions to Factory Fun and Powerboats for free. But this one was a disappointment. My problem with this game is that economic auction games per se are suited to gamers but for this target group it doesn't offer enough opportunities. 
It also could have needed more development which I haven't experienced with Cwali games so far. The injuries are mostly inconsequential while the special power of the team manager is overpowered. Corné should stick with his strengths (rather abstract placement/logistics/racing games with few rules but a good brain-burning factor).

So bland and uninspired that if we hadn't been playing this with a couple of random walk-ins, I suspect we'd have stopped after a couple of rounds.

It feels like the main problem is that there aren't really that many different dimensions to the characters. Every character is basically equally useful to every player. So it's really a very simplistic auction game, with a thin sports managing theme on top.

Seems like a classic mid-weight euro, not offering anything new, but doing everything it does well.  I tend to not like sports-themed games, but here it is very abstracted and unique, since you don't see many basketball games around.

The main thing I don't like is the open money, which could be easily fixed, since it makes most of the auctions pretty obvious.  It also seemed to drag on just a touch longer than the gameplay merited, but that may have to do with inexperience with the game.

Nice auction/bidding game with a personal favorite as a setting (Sports Management/Basketball). So that's an additional bonus for me.

Having played it twice I must say that I like most of it pretty much. Not groundbraking but the basic features of teambuilding are included. The decision between "win now" and "build for the feature" is interesting, as well as finding the path of the least resistance for player (positions) and win now/team building.

Additionally the special characters (ref, agent, coach) are cool, especially the coach imo.

Normally, Cwali games are huge winners in my book but this one didn't really quite make the grade for me.  The appearance is a bit ugly in my book.

In short, the game was just more "meh" for me.

I like the artwork and clever components in Cwali games, and they fooled me into liking this game more than I should. This is a bare-bones auction game, and if you enjoy that, this is a good one. I prefer other mechanisms, so after 4 plays, this is going on the sale-pile. If you play it, make sure you get all the rules right. It´s not a complex game at all, but there are a few little rules that are easily missed the first time.

Please note the designer´s addendum here on the ´Geek: The minimum price for a player is 1 Million when using the agent.

RATING: 6
The game is based on a bidding mechanic, you bid for the best players.
Players have different strength and weakness in different seasons.
One player for each position (color) so if you get one "even-even" you will get more in long terms that if you buy a strong player that becomes weaker season after season.
To spice things up there are a couple of characters you can choose that give you special actions... there is also injuries that make you loose your star for a season if you loose the special bid...
In the end of each season the strongest team win a gold cup, second silver, third bronze.
The cups equal VP's.
In the end most VP's and last season team strenght are added up and the player with most points wins...

It's not brilliant but is a clever design.

Simple auction game. Fun and plays in a reasonable amount of time, although doesn't seem to have a lot of depth.

Basketball theme is a huge plus for me and definitely boosts my rating; if you don't care about (or actively dislike) basketball then maybe worth skipping this game.

The core is quite similar to O Zoo le Mio: A few tiles are auctioned each round, and you get money based on the tiles you own. The game on top of that is rather different; You try to maximize the power of your team, and the main thing here is that the power values of your tiles change each round.

RATING: 1.5
The bidding-part is much too important for my taste (Hoity Toity is one of the few auction-based games I can bear). Players who are into basketball will probably enjoy a few games - in fact it feels like the game was carelessly designed and the publishers thought the theme would be appealing enough to attract a few basketball fans (in this I was totally reminded of a horrible German national soccer league "manager" game from the 80s). Visually unappealing.

This is great fun! I was a little tepid about buying this game. I thought maybe it wouldn't be fun or would only be played on a rare occasion. It is a wonderful game by Cwali...the makers of Factory Fun. When I realized this, I thought what an idiot I had been for not trusting this company. This is a gem of a game, as I also think Factory Fun is. A game that's theme is fresh and new, fits perfectly with the mechanics of the game. There is such variety in choices and experiences during this game (i.e. hiring of Ref, Trainer, Bank, and the trophies your team can win. The simple artwork is awesome and humorous). A great game from a great company. 

Even if you are not a basketball fan, it doesn't matter the game is fun to play. The 2-player game is great with lots of choices, but the 5 player game maybe not quite as fun since choices will be more limited (in regards to the special characters you can hire). Needs more plays!

RATING: 6.5
This game plays very quickly and the theme is great.  The art is nice and does a nice job poking fun of some current and former nba players.  The balance is such that teams that win late are heavily favored, which new players seem to not fully realize during the first game.  I can actually see my rating moving higher for this game given more plays.  There aren't any suprising new mechanics, but everything flows well and the fun factor is high.

RATING: 7
Simple premise, bidding on players who provide a different value (0-5) in each of the coming 6 rounds / seasons. Some are consistent. Some are good now but bad later, and vice versa. New players replace 1 of the 5 players already in the team. Add up the points across 5 players you have for that round and most points wins VPs in order, Show Manager style. Bid for new players each round to hopefully further improve the team, or at least replace players who aren't so good in the coming seasons. The game is 6 rounds of 4-7 auctions, but most of these you won't be interested in so it doesn't feel that bad. As with most auctions, hope to buy value, or go low this round to save your money for future rounds. There's some special actions available at the end of each round which mixes things up a little. I found the game pretty enjoyable and while it's not a rush out and buy, I won't mind playing it in future.

Una vera sorpresa. A dispetto della grafica e dell'aspetto poco invitante, si rivela un giochino di aste molto divertente. 
Il meccanismo di calcolo dei punti della squadra (che unisce i colori-ruolo e i valori dei singoli) rende bene l'ambientazione: vale la pena schierare un campione fuori ruolo o rimanere fedeli allo schema con una squadra più debole? Azzeccata, anche grazie ai cambi di rendimento nelle stagioni, la variabilità dei giocatori acquistabili: non solo campioni e brocchi ma anche onesti giocatori danarosi, stelle a fine carriera, giovani forti ma senza una rendita, giocatori altalenanti.
Lo staff, che aggiunge pepe al gioco, è forse il più sbilanciato: l'agente è di gran lunga il più forte.
Non sarà un capolavoro, ma non mi rifiuterò mai di giocarlo se qualcuno lo propone.

QUite quick (1h) and simple auction game with a questionable theme. Although it's refreshing to have anything related to rarely-used basketball theme. The game has many tactical elements that can be ruined by your game partners. 

The lenght and the fun of playing are quite in balance. Definitely a good game.

Reminds me of Traumfabrik (without the potential of imaginative humour, though the player names are fun) with a dose of High Society and a couple of rule breaking powers thrown in. Strange that this was played on the same night as Hameln which should have been dripping with theme but mechanics didn't help, yet in Baseketboss, even though you don't play any matches, it summarises the feeling of a season well. Like basketball itself is a little repetitive and not that much fun.

RATING: 6.5
Rated after initial play. It's a standard auction game (I love auction games). The basketball angle is pretty fun. I don't like how the game's victory condition depends mainly on how good the team is in the last season.

I'd play again, but I'd stress that the victory condition depends mainly on how your team will be in season six.

Sold this one. I'd play it again, but I needed to thin my collection.

A really good auction game that has you drafting basketball players with varying abilities throughout their careers.  Really simple mechanics but has very difficult decisions.  Your long term team is very important and this can not be over looked from season to season.  Good solid game with a refreshingly under utilized theme that really works.

The aging mechanism of the players is quite nice as their abilities change as the seasons go on.  Plays quickly with an interesting theme.  I tend to like Cwali's games and this one appears to be as enjoyable as StreetSoccer and Factory Fun and could be another sneak hit for them.

A very original game both in theme and gameplay. Players try to assemble (by bidding) a set of players which Basketball team  which give an overall strength to the team. Each round awards (victory points) are awarded according to the overall strength. The game is great but the bidding does not work as well as it could and even with five players there seem to be plenty of players to choose from. This game would benefit from being a bit tighter.

So you like auctions? This game wraps them around a basketball manager theme and adds a few special characters to try and spice it up. The problem for me was that I wanted more. I wanted trades and hidden variation in performances and a larger roster and... more. I don't mind it, I just wanted... more.

One of my favorite themes for a game ever.  The theme doesn't usually add or subtract from my enjoyment of a game, but here it definitely enhances it.  The gameplay itself is relatively quick and fun, yet still features many interesting decisions typical of good Euros, so you don't have to be a sports fan or even have much knowledge of basketball in order to enjoy the game.  I love it!

A hoot. Has replaced Hollywood Blockbuster as my lite auction game of choice. The hook is the player stats - straight out of the 'Championship Manager' Pc series. Very very clever! Played twice with five - everyone enjoyed it, provoked lots of table talk. Third play with four and good buty preffered five.

With three it fell apart. The specalists are less interesting or important, the auctions less contsted, the income less important.

Must be played 4/5 player.

Méltatlanul háttérbe tolt játék. Remekül összerakott, könnyed sportjáték, ami -szvsz- ritka. Semmi görcsös erőlködés, semmi modellezési kényszer, szükségmegoldás és mégis tökéletesen visszaadja a kosárcsapatmenedzselés hangulatát. Van benne mindenféle mechanika és a végén egy zseniális összhang jön ki. Nagyon jó a felépítettség is: fordulóról, fordulóra érmeket szerzünk, de az utolsó forduló a legfontosabb, akkora jól kell időzíteni. Kiváló játék, nincs mit magyarázni.

Like Peloponnes discussed above, BasketBoss is an auction game masquerading as something else, this time as a sports game. As a huge fan of Corné van Moorsel's StreetSoccer, my interest was piqued by a new sports game by the same designer (despite the disappointment of Powerboats last year). Upon trying out BasektBoss, I realized just how little I knew about the game going in when I was surprised to find myself face to face with an auction game. The rules and turn summary are actually fairly hilarious if you're expecting a sports simulation of any kind. Phase 1 of each turn is called "Draft Players," which is all well and good, alright you're setting up your team, but then Phase 2 is "Win Trophies" and Phase 3 is "Earn Income." A word of warning for those who come after me: A basketball game this clearly is not. This is a game about bidding on players with various stats so that your team strength exceeds that of your opponents and you win trophies worth victory points. It may actually be a good auction game, but as with any auction game, I need to try it a few more times to get a good feel for it. Auction games are the type of game where its easy to learn the rules, but hard to learn the strategy and valuation of goods. I had to play Ra and Modern Art a number of times before being able to say with any degree of certainty that I greatly prefer the former over the latter, and thus BasketBoss is another auction game with an almost irrelevant theme that needs to be played more to test out the tension of the bidding and how sound the game's economy really is. That being said, the game's theme may serve a useful purpose for introducing non-gamer basketball fans to a German-style auction board game.

The English rules translation could be a bit better, but this filler+ offers a good amount of fun. The luck of the tile draw, having the money when the players you need become available is a big determinant of the winner, but the quick play time makes the amount of randomness feel about right.

Want to be the GM of a basketball "fantasy" team.  This game is for you as you compete to win 6 season titles.  Probably plays better with more players than fewer (as do many auction games).

Each player of this game is the manager of a basketball team.

Draft good new basketball players. With each of these players you see what is his expected value in next 6 seasons. And you see his best field position, his height, and how popular he is which is good for your team funds.
\13\\13\
Get assistance from a trainer, player agent, banker or even the referee to win the trophies.\13\
The TRAINER can bring your players on the level they would normally reach next season.\13\
The PLAYER AGENT helps you for getting good prices at the transfer market.\13\
The BANKER gives you a good interest.\13\
The help of the REFEREE makes your team 'stronger'.

Try to win the most valuable trophies during your manager period. That, and good perspectives for the current season, is all your team fans want!

Find this one in a new on-line shop. It was on sale and it was the last copy left. Take a quick look at the game, and decided to buy it. Never played a game designed by Corné van Moorsel before, but we heard he designed some really nice games. When we set up the game, we were attracted by the funny graphics. We expected a light game. But it is deeper then it looks. This is a game in which you have to calculate further on into the next rounds. We don’t own or play a lot of sports-themed games, but this one made us want to play others.  But first look if we can find more games designed by Corné van Moorsel.

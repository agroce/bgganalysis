Attilla the Hun gets wrapped up in the stockmarket while overruning Europe. Work that one out. About as poor an attempt to paste a theme on a Eurogame as you can imagine. And it's not even that good a game. Rating 5 - minus 1 for the theme

There's more going on here than it appears on the surface.  Quite simple rules, but I realized only too late about engaging in conflicts in order to get rid of useless cards. Neat, but let's see if it stands the test of time.

After one play.  Pretty good territorial influence game.  Pluses are that it is very easy to learn and plays fairly quickly.  Disadvantage is I can see that the game will usually end before all the peacemarkers are played - we never made it to the fourth round.  Also making the scoring track markers the same color as the people was very confusing.  Despite those criticisms however, I did enjoy it and would play again.

RATING: 7
If you think that this game is dominated by the luck of the draw and the player has no control, you have not understood the subtlety of this game.  The sequence in which you play your cards have a decisive impact because the same card scores different amounts of influence in different centuries.  (When the competition is tense, the 1st and 2nd places are often decided by a difference of a few points of influence.)  Where you place the people is also very important because you can influence the partitioning of the centuries.

Known as Attila the Stockbroker in these parts, which isn't funny unless you remember the British punk poet of that name.  I was initially very resistent due to the odd thematic combination of barbarian invasions and Acquire-like stocks.  

Rules-wise Atilla is a very straightforward game; play a card, place a matching piece in an area of the board and increase your influence in the corresponding tribe. There is luck in the card draw, but the game offers several ways to mitigate that.  Admittedly, one of those is to dump cards into a conflict you don't care about, making them quite risky and chaotic.  Four scorings are triggered by varying numbers of conflicts.  There are some nice decisions around timing (whether to trigger a scoring) and whether and how to start a conflict.  The double turn chits bother me somewhat as they can be very powerful late in the game.

The quality of the cards, board and bits is all good, though the duplication of tribe and player colours causes unnecessary confusion and the stockmarket is a bit cramped.  I rather like the dark-hued artwork.

This is a decent essentially abstract game that plays relatively quickly.  You could do a lot worse than this for sure, but it just doesn't really rise to the level of wanting to be played again for me.  Perhaps it is much better when played by two or three (we played with 5)

2002-ben bementem egy hipermarketbe, azzal az elhatározással, hogy veszek valami újfajta társasjátékot (akkor otthon csak néhány szocialista gyerekkori játékunk volt, azon kívül ismertem az activityt, monopolyt, tabut, risket, tehát azokat, amiket mindenki ismer:)). Támpontom nem volt, készlet se volt nagyon, a kevés lehetőség közül a nekem külsőre legjobban tetszőt választottam, ez volt az Attila. Az első játék csalódás volt, másodszorra viszont már ráéreztem, mi az értelme. Nem egyszerű jól játszani, bár nem is túl komplex. Területfoglalás és az egyes területek hierarchiájának befolyásolása a két fő cselekedet a játékban. Nagyon távolról a Reef encounterre emlékeztet (a hierarchia miatt), de ez sokkal ötlettelenebb. Viszont a dobozban lévő faanyag tekintetében top játékról beszélünk: 120 db egész nagy fabábú van benne (6 x 20 db). Összességében szép darab, átlagos játékmenettel.

RATING: 4
First Play: Just a bit at sea when the game started but soon picked up on the finer points after a few rounds. However the finer points seem at the mercy of the card draw. Its nice to be first and second in a few colours but if you don't draw the right cards you wont be. Yes there are some tactics to use but you wont be able to do anything clever without the right cards.

Overall feeling at game end was that the game was playing me. I don't really want to play that again.

Agreed to second play years after first before I remembered I'd played before. Second time around was worse than the first outing and absolutely reinforces the chaotic randomness of the card draw. Some players gallop into lead with a colour with 17+ points whilst others don't even draw those coloured cards. What is interesting is that players who are doing well fail to see the significand short comings and overwealming luck of the game. Rating reduced to a 4 but the card lottery renders this a game of 80% luck.

A stock game where you invest into various tribes.  This one made my head hurt.  Turns are simple but the ramifications can strech out.  A second play, i'm sure, will open up the possibilities of this one. 

The influence tracking board sucks.  I'm sure I made all sorts of mistakes with it.  I was thinking chips of the tribes colors would be a good way to do that, or cubes.

Some tense choices in this one.  Not sure how this would be with more than three...seems it could get quite chaotic.

FInd it hard to get my head around this one. It's colorful and ncie to play, but somehow the balance of power shifts in funny ways and it's got a very different feel to most teritorial games. You don't have pieces of any one color, the colored armies are just germanic hordes, and everyone can add to them, but you're all leaders competing for influence over them and whoevr has most at the turn of each century gains most. Quite intriguing.

The design if cactus though. You can't play it at all with the supplied pieces as the germanic hordes all havce a color and each player has a color, and they overlap but are not the same. And hence blue can have influence over the red tribe and red over the blue tribe, and I have't met anyone who could master this without going crazy. Easy fixed though, replace the players pieces with little beads or cubes otherwise marked (by shape of different coloirs or wahtever we use letter beads).

Played it once and came in second, I think, but didn't particularly enjoy it.  Theme seemed paper-thin, and game play wasn't strong enough for an abstract.

12/20/05 - played first game 3-player. Strategy and tactics all rolled into one game. One key to doing well at this game is to be sure you do not fall too far behind in influence on all tribes. It may be that with more players this will be impossible so you might need to be strong on a few tribes and play to frustrate the others. Need to play this more - a really good game.

Attila is an unusual game for Karl Heinz Schmiel, who is normally known for designing longer, more involved games quite outside the standard Euro canon. If anything, Attila is actually too ensconced in the style for its own good, the game is austere, almost to the point of losing all of its charm.

The concept here is simple: 6 tribes, each with corresponding cards in the deck. Players manage a hand of 6 cards. On their turn, each player plays a card, places a piece of that colour, and then gains influence in that tribe, with later round card plays creating more influence. When 5 tribe pieces end up in one area, conflict erupts, and everyone has the opportunity to play cards of the tribes present, influence is totaled, and the weak tribes get eliminated. At four points in the game, scoring results after conflict, with points being given out for total pieces of the tribe on the board, and total provinces that they have presence in for second. Total score wins at the end.

The game is surprisingly fast and light for a Schmiel. Individual turns are very fast, and the game has a decent flow of build up and then conflict. The main problem present here is the lack of control. Hand sizes are small, and as Josh Miller astutely pointed out some time ago, the late game moves are worth a lot more than the early game ones, which pairs poorly with the system with rewards later game card plays. This is, in short, a game that I think is playing me more than I am playing it. That said, it's short, tolerable in its time frame (30 mins or so with 3) and I wouldn't mind seeing it on the table again. Not as much here as I might have hoped though. I really like the scoring system, and would have liked to have seen it reused in a game system with more control over the piece placement.

I think this game is quite nice, although it can be a little static...tastes a little like El Grande, a little like Kardinal und Konig, a little like Acquire, maybe a hint of Euphrat and Tigris in the conflict resolution...  This really should have recieved more recognition because it's very attractive, fun to play, scales well for all numbers of players, and offers fairly deep strategic play for such a compact package and short playtime.  Sadly out of print but can be found as of 7/03 at at least one online retailer (the one that starts with "B", hint hint ;-) ).

A great game right up there with El Grande, Web of Power, Wallenstein and Wongar for me. If you don't have this one your missing out. Its a game you must at least try. The decisions on who to support in a battle, which tribes to influence and where to send their troops are all critical.

Attila is based on scoring points for having the most influence on a group of markers on a map. The idea of awarding points to their number and the number of areas they are in is simple and makes for a solid game. Attila plays quick once everyone manages to decouple the colours of the playing and influence markers in their minds (a never-ending source of player errors!). Unfortunately, Attila is held back because of the random card element making strategic planning very difficult, especially in the 4th era when, figuratively speaking, fortunes are made and lost. It also has a clear optimum number of players to play with, despite being advertised for between 2 and 5. (2 = follow the leader, 5 = grab what you can get, because there is too much happening between your turns.) Regrettably, it never saw much table time since the early attempts, and I eventually decided that it was time I let the game go. I hope it found a good home where it will be looked after with love and tenderness.

[b]Update[/b] A replay or two with 3 players (which I think I never managed when I still had this game myself) confirmed that my decision to sell of this game was essentially justified. The problem is mostly in the random card draw, and a tendency to create lockout problems where two players, having a lot of cards in one colour, 'conspire' of sorts to lock out the third. Really the only option is to stick close to the other players, or to mirror the pattern of a strong colour in another; the alternative of striking out on your own is simply not viable. While the game is playable under these circumstances I dislike the numbers game hidden underneath the business of gaining influence in various populations.

Another game in which the theme has absolutely nothing to do with the game play.

Eh.  Not Karl-Heinz Schmiel's finest hour, to be sure.  You need cards to get power, yet you're supposed to use those same cards to cause other people to lose points.

I'm a sucker for influence games and card-driven board games so I can't resist playing Attila. Unfortunately the player & tribe markers use the same colours (very confusing for new players) otherwise its simple to explain, but has a lot going on. Replayability's not as high as I'd like either.

A fine stock market simulation game.  Fair bit of luck with the cards you draw, but also a fair bit of control with how they are used.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable abstract stock-market type game, despite the 'blood-and-thunder' images conjoured by the title. Only played with 2 and 3 players but works just fine. Lots to think about and the players have a considerable amount of control over their fates - even when the luck is against you and you don't draw the cards you want, there are still strategems you can use them on. 

It's all about the timing of the conflicts and use of your double turn.

Also - quality components and aesthetics, except for the overlap between player colours and tribe colours which leads to confusion. I have bought 4 sets of different coloured cubes for the players to use problem solved.

Played with 4 players now as well - 3-player is the sweet spot, with four players it gets a little chaotic with how fast age ends can be sprung on you without any means to cover it.

Place different colored guys on the board, when that spot has 5, eliminate the smallest 2 colors.  Score points every so often.  Rinse, repeat.  Nothing great, nothing bad here.  The theme is paper thin. Don't expect Attila to show up and shed blood.  Some have called this game "Attila goes shopping for shoes".  This really should have been a game about shopping.  :)

A complex "simple" game, themed on the tribes migrating across Europe. Players play cards from there hand to position tribe markers on a map of Europe, and score influence points over that tribe. This placement may cause a conflict, which in turn can trigger scoring rounds. Most influence in a tribe earns victory points, which decides the game. The game plays very cleanly, but the scoring is a bit messy.

I like some aspects of it, but the random card draws seem to have too much influence. The one game I've played would have gone entirely differently if the other player had drawn a single red card when she turned in 5 cards, using her action chit to do so. Well, maybe not "entirely", but she would have won. She also hadn't drawn one for quite a bit before that. I don't think more players would improve it. 

UPDATE: Okay, I was wrong - this is much better with more players. But still not great.

This feels like a weird mix of an area control game and the stock system of Stephenson's Rocket in that you can gain influence of a particular tribe by using that tribe.  In Stephenson's Rocket you have free choice whereas in this game you can only use tribes based on cards in hand.  I thought I would really like this as player's have a lot of control on how to end rounds and the game however this was not the case.  The card draw can be killer at times and the game get's more and more volatile as the game goes on.  

What do I mean by volatile?  Well, when you play a card to get influence within a tribe, you get a number of influence equal to the round you are playing.  So the luck of the card draw becomes more pronounced as you proceed.  

Then there are the bonus tiles, one of which really bugs me.  One of the bonus tiles allows you to take a second turn.  So in the fourth round which is the final round you can use this tile to effectively gain 8 influence in a particular tribe before anyone can react.  Often times the gaining of this 8 influence can cause the end of the game.  

The last negative thing I would say about this game is that in area majority games you generally want to be first place in a given area to score the most points.  In this game, you can have the second most influence in a tribe and score as many or almost as many points as the person who has the most.

I don't really know what to say other than there are an extremely large number of area majority games out there and you can certainly find better than this one.

The color system in this game is absurdly awesome.  You need one player to devote themselves to nothing but keeping the score chart sorted (players have colors and the scoring track has colors - move red a space on yellow, move blue a space on red, etc.).  The game was fun, but I've forgotten most of it.  Need to try again!

Everybody refers to this as a stockmarket game but I'm never really sure what that means. 

You place one of six colours of tribesman on the board, sweeeping down from the North (starting from the top). Each tribesman you place gives you influence in that colour. Whenever you get  tribesmen in a territory, a conflict occurs. If the conflict starts a new era, a scoring round takes place and the amount of influence you get from each tribesman increases. 

The game is all about timing, when to trigger a scoring round and which tribes to go for influence in. The more tribesmen on the board, the more they are worth in points when you score. So it doesn't pay off to specialise too much. 

A changable game that I really like but have only got the timing right on a couple of occasions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Extremely simple game, a little lucky in the card draw, but it plays out very nicely. The production has a foolish mistake in that the 5 players tokens for influence and scoring are the same colours as the tribes. This causes pointless confusion and could have easily been avoided. Try finding your own player bits if you can.

My biggest complaint about Attila is the scoring cubes.  Why couldn't they make the scoring cubes in different colors than the playing pieces?  It's just way too confusing, even after multiple plays.

We can't get enough of this one.  Keep an eye on your neighbors as regions fill up quickly along the border, expand and don't spread yourself too thin.  It is useless to try to be in each category, try being in a majority position in 2 or 3 at the most.  When fights break out, try to wipe out those colors where you have no influence; it is a great way to diminish the other tribes' presence.

After Three Games: This one is growing on me. I&#039;ve raised it to a 7.5 after a 2-player experience today. The more I&#039;ve played it the more strategy/tactics I see. Yes, it&#039;s still fairly abstract, but game-play and tension are there. I think my initial disappointment was that I wanted it to be Attila the Hun riding out to overrun Europe (a semi-wargame). However, the cards were just colors. They could represent anything. If you can get over the fact that this is NOT a wargame, then it becomes a good game in its own right. Kind of like Clans not really being a wargame...

After One Play:This one has high quality components. I want to really like it - but although it is a very good game, it just doesn&#039;t grab me like I thought it would. Still, not bad. The bits are better than the game, however. Perhaps it is the theme. I think it is a very weak theme, bordering on the abstract.

Being a fan of ancient history, I liked the feeling of the "barbarian" peoples migrating throughout Europe and N. Africa,

however, that feeling was largely overshadowed in game play by the abstract "area control" process of placing little cubes on territories and comparing them. Also, the influence board mechanism (like that in Medici) felt dry and unsatisfying as well.

Whichever player placed cubes allowing the next player to end the age (age = game turn essentially) allowed that player a huge advantage.  It seems as long as you don't screw up too badly, you will win if you have the opportunity to end ages more than once.

For those who like area control games, this has more theme and variation than most.  Just not my cup of tea.

This isn't a bad game at all, and it did have some interesting moments, especially when you get into the swing of things.  The problem with this game is that there are a lot of good area control games and there just isn't enough to set this one apart, especially considering the competition it has.  The muddy artwork doesn't help either.  I like how the tribes descend from the North, and I like how you try have the most influence on the tribes.  Some people have complained about the colors used for the tribe pieces matching the colors of your pieces, but since none of your pieces are ever on the map, it really wasn't that much of a factor for us.  So, yeah, not a bad game, but nothing outstanding either.

Area majority & "stock" game with simple rules and quick game play. Works best at 3?

Having only played Attila a number of times on www.feuerteufel.nl, I can only speak to the online version of the game. It's a solid, light-weight euro where players make one of two moves: A) place a figure in a color corresponding to one of your cards in hand and take influence in that color; or B) place two figures in a color and do not take influence. Once an area hits five figures, regardless of color, players can play cards from hand to add to the figure color that they want to see win. The game is played over four rounds. The first round is scored when one area is full, the second round is scored when two areas are full, and so on. 

It's devishly simple and quick to play, which for this weight of game, is perfect. Earth-shattering - no. Brilliant - no. But just the right blend of tug-of-war and quick game play make it one that is worth playing if not owning. 

Although I haven't played live, I suspect there could even be a bit of non-binding negotiating in here too. Something like, "If you play a green card for me in this area, I'll play a yellow for you when that area is scored." 

Probably plays best at 4 and second best at 3.

The design choices here are likely to frustrate the master strategists among us.  There's a built-in inflation mechanism that makes later moves much, much, much more important than early moves - yet the hand size is too small to allow any meaningful planning for the later stages of the game!  Factor in the nonsensical theming and the poor color choices, and I'd say the negatives outweigh the positives.  A disappointing game from a very good designer.

I must play Attila again to really get a handle on my views. What you do in the game seemed to me to have little influence on the final score, except being the one to trigger a scoring round, triggering the end scoring is particularly rewarding. *UPDATE* next played 18 months later and coincidentally we again followed the game with Web of Power.

I like this game a lot. Elements of Medicci. New players tend to get confused by the colors of the tribes vs. their color on the scoring track.

The person in first wants to consolidate. Plays quick once color confusionis over. Less than an hour.

This was a neat area influence game that takes place in Europe, where players control the migration of Germanic tribes towards the Roman Empire. Scoring feels similar to Oasis or Princes of Machu Picchu, where it is number of your own meeples in a given area times the relative ranking of that tribe. I'd definitely want to try this again. Simple, no-nonsense Euro gaming fun. It's an '8'.

Update (07/07/12) 2 plays: I did not know the designer is of the Die Macher fame. There is an intriguing "stock market" element to the game, where players fight to manipulate the relative value of a given tribe, as well as fight to maintain 1st or 2nd place seniority for VP scoring. First place: VPs equal to the number of meeples on the board. Second place: VPs equal to number of areas occupied. Collusion among players can quickly take down a leader, by instigating conflicts in certain regions, and killing off meeples. Fast, fluid, fun, with interesting tactical and strategic considerations. Still a solid '8'.

Decent enough game, would have rated it an 8 but the begining of the game is just so damn boring (yet necessary for the rest of the game).  I like the conflict and constant change of leaders on the scoring track.  The winner is hard to determine until the end of the game.

Fast under an hour game that combines a stock market with area majority. Moving the cubes along the stock board felt fiddly because player cubes and stocks share colors. The game board has a dark wash over it which doesn't really look inviting. But its greatest letdown was the luck factor and constraints that the cards bring into play.

Subtle game of getting most influence on the tribes positioned best. It actually could be a train game. Instead of purchasing shares influence is placed with tribes and instead of laying track the tribes migrate. The first plays can leave players wondering what this is all about. In the second game it clicked for me and I started to realize the opportunities. The game is decided by timing the scorings best. Potentially best with three as with more there might not be enough influence on setting up your portfolio for the scorings. There are too many subtle games around that need more play and experienced players to live up to its potential. Attila was not good enough to make this selected circle.

RATING: 7
Conflict & Peace! On the surface this looks like a simple "area control" game, but peel back a layer and you'll find some satisfying tactical subtleties. The base game mechanic has everyone gain tribal influence at a fairly constant rate, so the trick is to make sure the tribes in which you  have influence are the tribes that are worth the most points. Proper timing of conflicts, the two-tribal-piece move, and the special action chits are what determine the winner. Manipulating conflicts is important because it alters the values of the tribes, and also can determine if a scoring round occurs. This is a good, deep game that should rank high in the pantheon of area control games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a bad game at all - offers some interesting choices in a fairly quick area majority game.  Would probably never be a favorite, but I'm surprised this one remained as low profile as it did over the years.  Probably has to do with the laughable, forgettable theme.  I really felt like a hun when playing this game.

RATING: 7.5
Feels a little more random than some games of this type, but it does seem with some calculated moves you can pull ahead by using the various special tiles.  I suspect having four or five players really is good for this game as it seems to balance it out a bit while not making it too predictable.   I might change some of my feelings of this game after a few replays.

Attila is very easy to play.  Each turn you simply play a single card, and place a meeple accordingly.  Where you place your meeple opens up a wide selection of strategic choices.  You must decide which of the six tribes you intend to compete in, weighing how your opponents are doing, both in that tribal competition, as well as how they are doing  relative to you in the game score.  

In order to pursue your plans, you must also draw the needed cards.  Therefore it is important to stay flexible, and shift your strategies according to the cards you draw.  The card draw can make your strategies fail - and this is perhaps the weak point of the game.  

There is a lot of strategy needed to play well in Attila.  At the same time, your inability to draw needed cards can foil the best strategist's well laid plans.  Ultimately, I am at peace with this, as I enjoy a substantial amount of luck in games.  However, I suspect those who prefer to have more control have swept past this game as "too random".

We gave it a few tries. It was dry and dull, with a serious color-confusion issue. Play red cards to move your blue token up the red track, etc. It feels odd to play colored pieces to the board, but to have the colors not represent you and your opponent. Maybe it is very strategic and I am just a gaming wimp. Traded it for San Juan (which we love) and En Garde (which itself has since been traded, for Pisa).

Played twice.  4 & 5 players.  I liked this game more than it deserves.  I say that because plans are tenuous at best.  You're at the mercy of the deck, which is not so bad in and of itself.  But, in our games, the person who sat to the right of a player who ended a century was at an enormous disadvantage.  You might say "setup your own scoring events!"  Easier said than done.  It is also possible, and likely, that you'll try to get into a tribe early - then get shut out of any further influence in it for a large part of the game by drawing useless cards.

A stock market type game where one seeks to be either first or second in influence in the 6 different tribes invading the Roman Empire.  Scoring occurs at the end of each of the four centuries after 1,2,3,and 4 conflicts occur according to the century.  First in influence for a tribe earns you a point for each tribe meeple on the board.  Second in influence for a tribe earns you a point for each province the tribe has a presence.  On your turn, you play a card corresponding to one of the six colors and placing a tribe meeple in a legal province and then choosing to either add another meeple of the same tribe OR add to your influence in that tribe (increase in influence jumps at increasing amounts depending on what century it is.

wow, this is about as bad as eurogames get. First lets start with the stupid design decisions... only so the colors of the armies are blue, grey, black, green, red and yellow. And I am playing Yellow, but the yellow armies are not mine. Oh but I can control yellow armies with my yellow cube... how hard would it have been to make the players colors different than the invading army colors... or heck make the players differentiated by shapes or something other than a fucking cube. Is there some unwritten code of eurogame design that say you have to use only head and shoulder meeples and cubes in a game? 

then there is the gameplay... i draw a card and play a color... i can either expand that army or try and take control of it for scoring later... so if in the later rounds i don't have cards for the armies that are way ahead well.. i sit back and lose the game nothing really can be done about it. 

There just really isn't much of a game here folks.

I found this to be an enjoyable area control game, and I felt as though there was probably a considerable amount of strategy.

It is quite a fast-moving game, in which I feel that the clever use of one's turn can have a very large effect on the game.  Combined with the fact that the tribes which one chooses to influence are determined largely by what cards you have available, there is a very interesting balance between long-term and short-term strategy.

Unfortunately it is a bit fiddly, and the colour-scheme was more confusing than necessary; as a result some of the people in my gaming group didn't enjoy it and I didn't end up playing it very often.

This game might be fine if theres no meta-gaming involved, but if you have 2 players who naturally ally they will crush everyone at the table.  Of course only one will win, but its a somewhat broken mechanic of scoring for 1st and 2nd place in the particular tribes that enables this 'buddy' play.

A light easy game to play. Players put tokens onto the board and advance their influence marker for that tribe. Conflicts occur if more than 4 tribes are in one area. Depending on the epoch, a number of conflicts trigger a soring round. Sort of in the same category as Web of Power. Fun, light strategy game. There is some strategy, but sometimes epochs end without any control on your part. Games clock in around 45 min or so.

A really nice area control game - has an interesting "stock market" mechanic to show the players differing levels of involvement (investment) in the different tribes. Pretty board. 4 and 5-p games need to be kept going at a reasonable momentum or else it can slow down.
The players control tribes of restless barbarians spreading from northern Europe across the crumbling remains of the Roman empire. There are six tribes controlled by all the players together. Each time a player chooses to migrate one of the tribes to a new area, he can gain influence with that tribe. Periodically there are scoring rounds where the most influential players are rewarded for their "investment' in each tribe.

This is a stock market game. It has nothing to do with Attila or the decline of the Roman empire. The real problem I have with this game is that the player doesn't represent anything, which means its un-engaging. I'd rather play Rheinlander or Kardinal&Konig for a game in this category.

I use the shoe salesmen theme ... how shoe store chains from Scandanavia were competing to open up stores across the Med, but a 5th in any sales region would spark an economic bust resulting in disaster for some shoe store chains before an equilibrium resulted that matched supply and demand for that region. Win by obtaining ownership in the most successful store chains. Much better fit.

It takes a play or 2 for the tricks to reveal themselves. After 4 plays, I don't feel like there's much more to learn though. Worm your way into the most successful chains as far as your cards allow you (luck plays a part) and manage the differential in scores between yourself and the leader in the final rounds rather than always maximise your own influence. And pus the chains you aren't interested in as much as you can. Still a decent game, although the gameplay doesn't change much from game to game.

Based on one play: The first thing you will note is that it is easy to confuse your player color with those of the different tribes, this should have been noted in the design.

Acquire variant, which in some ways is better than it's predecessor, but on the other hand isn't. Like Chess, spatially starts off the same, unlike the variable setup of Acquire. Where Attila succeeds is that you have more control at triggering off the scoring and the scoring is easier and not as long winded. Also manipulation of values is innovative, involving fun removal of potential scores, but as this is done secretly, no hard feelings. I'm a sucker for scoring tracks, but the downfall for Attila (for me)is that whilst the scoring is delayed means dry number crunching, which progressively gets harder as the board fills up. The certainty of the 1st and 2nd place shareholders removes the desired mystery in Acquire. Attila also has a shorter playing time and consequences of such simple card play is interesting to explore.

One of the few area influence games that I really enjoy. Works incredibly well with two players. I like how relatively easy it is to attack the areas your opponents control. Unfortunately, the mechanics are somewhat counter-intuitive, and there are a few fiddly rules; as a result, my dad doesn't care for this one.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting but chaotic mechanics: each player should be identified by a symbol instead of color, like Tigris & Euphratis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Essentially a mathematical puzzle to solve: how to maximize your points based on the cards you got (randomness) and the actions taken by other players (chaos) based on the rules (structure), combining an area-control scoring system with a partial stock-market scoring system (rewards only for having first or second place in a color).  I was dazed going into it, but quickly determined a few principles that seemed to serve me well; I won, anyway.  I tend to do reasonably well at games of this sort, with well-defined area-control systems (e.g. Mexica, Euphrat & Tigris), but I also tend to prefer games where I can role-play a more fully realized theme than this game provided, and winning has never increased my rating for a game.

I&#039;ve found Attila more enjoyable once you study the scorecard and just glance at the playing board. A little too much going on at times - forget about counting the tribal blocks, it&#039;s more important to focus on staying ahead in at least two tribes. Ridiculous theme. If I was a German tribe retreating from the Mongol hordes, I&#039;d be settling anywhere I could. I wouldn&#039;t care who was camped next door, as long as it wasn&#039;t the big A.

RATING: 8
A subtle and sadly underrated influence game.  The systems are easy to pick up, but strategies are revealed only through repeated playings. Forget the migration theme - it's essentially a stock market game, and the crux of the strategy is to manipulate the timing of the scoring. Hits a bullseye for a medium-complexity Euro with real depth.  Confusion over colours seems to have turned off many from a game that should be regarded as a classic.

I wanted to like this, but it is very dry and abstract.  An area majority game, but you have little power to manipulate what's on the board, just aid to it.  A version of a stock holding game, but more of a slow gradual investment, rather than the dynamism of spending a lot of money to jump in on (or take control of) a rising company.

This is a game that I very much want to play again.  Although I see some of the similarities to Acquire that others mention as a negative, it really is not all that much.  It seems anytime there is a situation where first and second score points, the game is going to be "like Acquire."  It really needs more than this to be "like" Acquire.  So far, my biggest beef has been the use of cards to determine  what tribe you play.  Just like in Acquire, this seems to force you play in ways you really do not want to.  Perhaps this is a balancing mechanism that more plays will bring out.  At any rate, in Union Pacific (another Acquire "clone") the use of the track cards does not have as much of an effect (if any) as the cards in this game do.  We'll see how this rating holds up.

Wait, did the red piece get moved the 5 points or did we move the blue piece then too? Back up ... What color are we on, red or blue?")

A nice little train game cleverly disguised as a influence war game, adding "conflict".  Good game suffering from a terrible game design.  Conflicting color problems galore. Move the blue two up the green track, moved the green three on the red track, and red 4 on the red track.  So needlessly confusing, It completely distracts from the game.  I had a hard time figuring out what was going on on the main board in collaboration with the influence board, so I just paid attention to the influence board and  won.  Not much to think about between turns.

Basic area-control game.  Enjoy that you can create conflict by putting the last piece in a region to tip it over the edge.  A bit difficult to create differentiation.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Wow, this is pretty good! It's an old game, with a few somewhat annoying production issues:
- tribe colors are the same as player colors, so you end up saying things like "move the yellow marker up 2 spaces on the black track" and hope they don't end up moving the black marker up 2 spaces on the yellow track!
- the player cubes don't fit easily on the influence track!

But the game play is good! Like Clans, there are several (6, here) colors of tribes. On your turn, you play a card to expand a tribe; your influence goes up in that tribe 1-4 (Turn #) points. If your expansion into a region results in 5+ pieces, there's a battle: players may spend cards to add to tribes' strengths; only the strongest tribe(s) remain, with others removed from that region; that region is now sacrosanct -- unchangeable for rest of game. Periodically (after 1-4 battles, according to Turn#) scoring occurs: Players with most/second most influence in each tribe score points (most = # meeples in play; 2nd = #regions with meeples), with ties splitting points. The player with the most points after 4 Turns wins the game.

If it weren't for the production issues, I'd hunt down a copy. As it is, I'll likely wait for a reprint.

A little bit fiddly and odd at first until you get used to it. The scoring can get a little messy if you are not careful. The main problem is that the tribe colors and player colors are the same.

A very simple area majority/influence game that plays quickly and cleanly. It's a tiny bit too dry for my tastes, and not drawing the color cards you're looking for can make or break your game, meaning luck plays a heavy role here.

Atilla is a stock market game pretending to be a war game. You have a hand of cards in five colors. You play a card in a color to put that colored bit on the board. You also get to move up the influence table in that color... 1 space during the first era, 2 spaces in the second, 3 in the third and 4 in the fourth.

Whenever five bits are in a region, it starts a war. Starting with the player who placed that bit, all players play cards, if they wish, of any colors that match bits in that region. You reveal cards simultaneously and add up the number of bits and cards of each color. Whichever color has the lowest total has all its bits removed from the region. That region is then locked and can't be changed for the rest of the game. After the first war in era 1, second in era 2, etc. there is a scoring round before advancing to the next era. The player who is highest in each color's influence track gets 1 point for every bit of that color on the board. The player who is second highest gets a point for every region those bits are in.

That's pretty much it. There's some tiles you can spend once a game to take a double turn, get two free influence in one track, or dump your hand and refill. And on your turn you can forgo taking influence to place two bits of that color.

The game is very interesting and a lot of fun. You won't be able to compete in every color. And often being second is just as good as being first in a color. It becomes quite strategic to try and figure out where you need to compete. And often your hand will force you ways that you don't necessarily care for. Playing cards to support certain colors in wars is interesting as you'll often want to support a certain color, but also want to support a color just to clear cards from your hand.

This game was better than i expected it to be. not sure of the strategy yet but there is definitely some deep strategy in there... plays fairly quick too...
190103 played my second game and bumped up the rating 1.5 it's growing on me. if i played it regularly it could play very quickly. hmmm...upon reflection...i've dropped it down a point as there are many other games i'd probably rather play. Third play and it is getting more enjoyable with further plays. I am liking it now to that of Union Pacific. And in that light, I'll bump it up in my ratings.
Have dropped it down a notch. I think the artwork is dark and a bit dreary. The tracking board is difficult to see at a glance which colour is which and with all those little cubes on it, it's a fiddle factor too...But the game itself, is still great fun! This game is right up there with acquire and union pacific, don't let the mediocre ratings fool you!

Played once. Excellent area majority game. Conflicts add an extra value comparing it to Kardinal&König. Timing is even more critical in this game.
Consider the variants I took. See my thread about these.

Very nice game, very simple yet requires some thought. And of course, the scoring track is awful and confusing.

Though simple, I still like this. Easy to understand rules. Just a bit confusing with the colors in the beginning.

6 tribus se expanden. Turno: juega 1 carta para expandir una tribu y ganar influencia de ese color. Cuando se coloque la 5a figura en una región hay conflicto: jugadores pueden usar cartas de su mano para reforzar una tribu. Solo una sobrevive y se coloca un marcador de paz. Al final de la era ganas PVx influencia segun tamaño de la tribu.

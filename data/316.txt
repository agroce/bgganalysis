This has overtaken Entrapment as my third big abstract after Chess and Go. Why didn’t this take off? There must be something wrong with it but I haven’t played it enough to even give a guess to what that might be. This game needs some serious study to really find out its limits.

I have enjoyed several plays of this abstract. The use of the dice to provide for movement allowance, interchange values, and split into more dice, or bump and push other dice creates excellent depth of play and aesthetic appeal. Would like to pick up a copy or make my own!

OK, I bought the game used because I like dice, and found the rules but couldn't make the game work.  Then, after Google, I found illustrated rules that actually did describe the game and now it makes sense.  I still don't have any idea on a strategy though.  If I could figure out strategy I might enjoy it more.  I will look here on BGG before I play again.

How this one is out-of-print I'll never understand.  The rules are fairly straightforward but the resulting complexity of possible moves and strategies are quite interesting.

This is one of my all-time favorites! After 20 years with this fine game, I'm still happy to play any time I have a willing opponent.

A suprisingly good abstract game. It reminds me a lot of the game Knockabout by Pair-of-Dice Games. The dice are the playing pieces and are never rolled -- the pips merely indicate how far the piece moves. If you find this one at a garage sale pick it up -- it's worth it. Hey, I even like the gaudy, 1986, "Miami Vice" styling of the baord....

An interesting little abstract. You have dice, but you don't roll them. The number on the top face of the die is EXACTLY how many spaces that piece moves. Those numbers can change over the course of the game and some pieces can get captured, but that's about it.

I printed out the board that was here on the Geek and I also found a copy at a thrift store.

What a great little game! It's full of dice, but there's no chance. Just a few moves into  my first play I understood how to move and could move with intent. Little by little, strategies and bad plays became clearer.  You could play this game 20 more times and still discover new things about it. Chase meets my criteria for the ideal strategy game. Plus I just love moving the dice around like pawns.

An interesting abstract that is very interactive.  To me, it's somewhat similar to playing chess with dice as limited queen pieces ping-ponging on a cylindrical board.  Moves along fast and the replayability of it intrigued me enough to want to go again after my 1st game of it.  Capturing, splitting dice and transferring energy points make for a useful blend of balancing strategies.

Just reading the rules it seems as a wonderful abstract, with exciting mechanics and plenty of strategic possibilities. In practice it isn't that much fun. With pips scattered all over it's a bit hard to see what's going on, moderately difficult to track the moves, and dice aren't that practical for pawns as one would think. It's a fine game once in a while, but it's more probable that we play some other abstract instead.

Fantastic two-player abstract that utilizes die faces are used to determine movement options.  Try to capture your opponent and make it the chamber in the center of the board that splits dice (thus growing your army).  Pieces bounce of the top and bottom of the board and the board wraps left-to-right.  Great combination of offensive and defensive tactics.

RATING: 8
"Chess-like", if Chess pieces were dice, the board had a weird topology, and your options included bumping, splitting, wrap-around, and power-ups that you don't want. But while such a bewildering array of options sounds like it would be a mess, it's not. It's captivating. Slightly on the tactical side for my taste, but very enjoyable.

I think, I really do think, this is a cool game. The biggest hurdle is learning to see the possibilities. Every player has 9 pieces, each with 6 angles of movement, including reflection and translation. Throw in bumping and splitting and things get a little crazy! I'd like to get my hands on a copy of this to see if it has legs. I like the possibilities and it stands up as a 2p abstract.

Picked up a copy--practically gifted to me by a generous stranger at bgg.con 2016.

Fantastic abstract game, boasting ingredients both refined and unusual: players fight for survival (keeping the sum of pips in their dice at 25) moving their dice (used without any luck at all, there could have been markers instead) on the surface of a cylinder (a board where the sides connect and the back and front rows are bordered by walls where dice can ricochet). With only a few more mechanisms to open up the play Chase shows at the same time richness and clarity.

Chase should have been a classic. Maybe with a tasteful reissue it can still become one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Cool concept, but game is too abstract; hence I never found any opponents...

UPDATE: Finally got someone in my group to play this. It was a fun distraction, but because the piece movement isn't ingrained (like Chess), you have to calculate all the positions the dice can move to, remembring ricochets, wrap-arounds, and bumps. With 6 directions for each piece, you have to do a lot of re-figuring each turn, whereas in chess, there's no limit to the distance pieces can travel, you don't have to count squares (or hexes). 4->6

Several interesting mechanisms, the dice splitting, rebounding, being able to push a piece, wrap around board. The way the dice show the movement and a capture forces the points to be redistributed across the remaining dice. 
All leads to a thoughtful game with a chess like feel.

RATING: 6
Wonderful idea of an abstract, especially considering its publication date.

In practice, I thought there were too many forced moves. It's also tough to catch up when you're behind. The greater the pip value of a die, the harder it is to get it to the centre of the board to "make" new pieces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game idea in itself is probably worth an 8, but it's truly an 80's game design wise. So an updated design would bump rating up. 
I found a used copy in a shop today and played 4 streaight games with the owner of the shop. Lost all four, but kept improving and the last game took almost an hour... mostly due to none of us was willing to give up and both played with only 5 die over the last 20 minutes! Nice novel mechanics and lots of depth.

A very good little game that I think most abstract players would enjoy. (At least, if they can take a board that wraps around to the right and left.)

It uses dice - as the pieces. The play revolves around capturing pieces and splitting off new ones, which will change the values showing on the dice, which also determines movement. The total number of pips on each side's dice are a constant, so you win by forcing the other player to fewer pieces than what it takes to show that many pips.

Part of a series of abstracts released by TSR in the eighties. The game board is several rows of hexes, and players line up on opposite sides. The playing pieces are dice, with the face-up side being a piece's speed, or the exact number of spaces that that die moves.

THIS is my sort of dice game. This game is heavily tactical but there are over-arching strategies that can really help solidify a win. Hard to teach new players; the ruleset is simple, but the notion of a 'wrapping board' can really blindside people for quite some time, in my experience.

Abstract strategy game. Nicely packaged. Plenty of dice but they are not rolled so no luck in this game.

Sadly forgotten abstract game that's got a lot under the hood. Someone's got to reprint this with an updated look.

Not bad at all for an abstract.  With dice.

But it's still just an abstract.

This is a really cool abstract strategy game.  It uses dice as the pieces, taking advantage of the fact that they are dice (you can transfer pips between them — although I could see playing with Primordial Soup critters, instead), played on a hex grid that's on a projection of a cylinder with bouncy ends, and a magical piece splitter in the middle, which can bring eliminated pieces back into play.  The real genius of the game is that there is conservation of pips.  When a piece is captured, the pips must be absorbed by your weakest piece, which can really mess up your defensive plans.  The only downside is that as you get close to your demise, your pieces can't maneuver very well, due to the requirement of moving their full number of pips; on the other hand, it means the end comes quickly once the decline gets so far, because you lose when you can no longer find homes for all 25 pips (i.e. you only have 4 dice left).

80s abstract game.  Cool font.  

Good strategy game.  My wife hates it so I don't get to play often as she is my primary opponent in 2 player games.

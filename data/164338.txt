A reasoanbly close attaempt to the impossible 'civ game in 2 hhours). It certainly fits the 2hr mark and although you could argue that the mechanics are of typical euro standard they do evoke the theme of building up a civilisation quite well (certainly better than the ‘spreadsheet’ looking Historia did last year). And it has a map.

LIKE: Simple rules, fast eras with minimal downtime. Interesting combos. Good tech tree that seems well balanced. The first-to-pass mechanism is clever.

DISLIKE: Graphics are dark, and some iconography is hard to discern. The game could use a few more cards for variety. Not that fun at 2 players.

OVERALL: The best part was the final era because the choices were so agonizing, and trying to guess who would pass first to end it. I find the conflict/war portion very minimal, I barely notice it. Sometimes the war element becomes highly valued as people began to eye the end-of-era scoring cards (3 plays, upgraded rating). Best at 4 players.

Civilization done right.  This is a great design which distills/abstracts many of the civ elements without losing the civ feel.  Very impressed with this.

Wow. Great game. 

A very euro feeling civ game, but there is lots to explore and you do feel the theme. Lots of tough decisions and really fun gameplay. 

I've deducted .3 because I really dislike some of the art (though in fairness the iconography is excellent).

1st Play: The art in this game is beyond abysmal, but the game itself was actually pretty decent.  At first, I wasn't interested in playing this at all, but as the night wore on, I ended up reflecting back on it, and I think I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Lots of choices, and each civ had some personality to it.

No second play here.  I'd be willing to, especially as I've heard the reprint has better art and that was my primary complaint with the game originally.  The score could very possibly go up as well.

Gioco ben costruito.Mi piace soprattutto perchè dura il giusto per assaporare un gioco di civilizzazione senza rimanere al tavolo 4 o 5 ore.Diverse strategie e un'approccio alla guerra che avviene in forma "quasi" indiretta visto che al massimo si sposta solo il pedone dell'avversario.Unica nota dolente è l'azione dell'artista che sinceramente ti fa guadagnare un punto li x li ma poi ai fini della strategia conta ben poco.L'espansione culti e culture diventa necessaria se si vuole dare un senso a questa azione .Consigliato.

As one of the video reviews said, this is the holy grail of Civ games. It's been streamlined enough that you can fit it in with other games in a single evening, and mostly teach it in a reasonable amount of time. But it's still a Civ game. The next step down, that I know of, is Pocket Imperium and that's more equivalent to chess than it is to Civilization.

Granted, there's games like Seven Wonders and (reportedly) Roll Through the Ages. From having played Seven Wonders and seen reviews of Through the Ages, I don't think I could get behind those games as Civ games any more than I could Pocket Imperium. Seven Wonders just felt like advanced Sushi Go - the "theme" had nothing to do with what I was doing. Roll Through the Ages looks to be advanced Yahtzee. I've also played Progress: Evolution of Technology, and that's just multi-player Klondike.

Throwing a Civ theme on a basic card or dice game doesn't make it a Civ game. The Golden Ages is (close enough to) a real Civilization game. It's perfectly fun, has some nice strategy, a good bit of variety (I bought the expansion and threw the art cards in, and any cards that ignored the cults+culture aspects of the expansion), and seems to go over well with a variety of players.

You must print out the card references and the art is horrible. It won't satisfy the need for a great, epic build-up and conquest of the world. But given the limitations that it is under, it's actually quite amazing.

RATING: 8.2
My favorite civilization game, I think. Hits all the things I like about civ games (tech trees, resource acquisition, feeling of progress and escalation) without the snowballing leader and harshness (and simply unfun-ness) of most military aspects. Combat here is still beneficial to the attacker, but it is very costly as well, and the loser doesn't feel that much sting, and more importantly, doesn't get particularly set back in their plans. Oh, and it also does all this in like 60 minutes?? 

Yeah, it's real good.

RATING: 8
The two hour civ game used to be something of a design grail.  Now there are many.  Generally that compression involves taking elements out: the board, conflict, exploration or a  tech tree. Luigi Ferrini keeps them all, albeit in tightly delimited forms.  That's most evident with conflict; each player is allowed to initiate no more than four battles each game - and they grow ever more costly.  The tech tree is not so much a tree as three separate branches.  What's remarkable is that despite everything appearing in condensed form, it still feels like there is plenty of decision space in Golden Ages.  It seems a thoroughly well designed and developed game.

I like the quirkily childlike artwork.  Production quality is good.  The iconography is reasonably intuitive, although the player aid with full card descriptions should be kept close at hand. My one gripe is with the tiny heads of leaders on the wonder cards.

Hmm. Interesting game. I like the way it limits attacks and there are some cool combos available. It makes me miss some of my favorite parts of Civ3 - collecting the specific resources on the map. That'd be a cool game - but that's not really what this is.

Excellent civilization game, some people might have looked past it due to the unique artwork by Alexander Roche, but I rather like that. The modular board is neat, so you don't have to adhere to our actual world, and I love that it spans such a wealth of time, from technological advancements like basic hunting and fire-building all the way to aviation and genetic engineering. Love the decision whether to keep your current Civ card or the next level, and then discard the other. Smooth area control and a number of other mechanics, and it's quite cool how they managed to pack what is usually a much more massive game into a medium weight Euro package.

Golden Ages is billed as a quick civ game, with simple rules, and on that I think it delivers.  Multiple paths to victory (I presume, I wouldn’t know).  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  We were done (inc rules) in 2 hours, once familiar this would take little over an hour.  Small amount of conflict, but this is limited.  Always many options on your turn, but limited scope for AP, and you’re always making progress, so feels good.

RATING: 7.8
A very solid, civ-style game that has been boiled down to a few essential mechanics.  It manages to give players a tech-tree and a world map and wraps it all up in a package that lasts 2 hours or less.  

Its a great feat of game-engineering that doesn't really get enough credit (perhaps due to a presentation style that hasn't exactly lit the community on fire).

It's not quite as chunky as the heavy-weights like Through The Ages, and not as accessible as 7 wonders but it deftly straddles the middle line somewhere in between the two.  Currently sitting just below an 8 in my rankings but might deserve to go higher. 

I think what holds it back is that sense of building or accomplishment that comes with other civ games.  It's not easy to look at the game and enjoy "this thing that I built".  Even 7 wonders is better at capturing this feeling for some reason.

Still I think it's a solid choice for a quick civ-style game.

Egész jópofa kis civilizációs játék, néhány ok, ami miatt talán kicsit lefelé pontoztam: az egyik a térképen való mozgások (a térkép darabjaiból egyébként a Föld térképét lehet kirakni, ez jó poén:)). Nekem ez a rész valahogy az kicsit erőltetett, kevésbé letisztult, ellenben a fejlesztési tábla nagyon pöpec, teljesen világos minden. A másik gond a kártyák kiegyensúlyozatlanságával volt, szerintem elég durva különbségek vannak teljesen azonos árú kártyák közt. A harmadik pedig a befejezés. Ha valaki kicsit jobban vezet, teljesen triviális, hogy a 4. körben (az egész játék összesen 4 körös!) 4 vagy 5 lépést hagy csak annak (3x3 pontért lefekteti a bábukat, aztán passzol), aki mondjuk úgy építette fel a civilizációját, hogy akár 20 lépésen át is kombózhatna. Nekem konkrétan olyan kombóm volt, amivel (szerintem egy kissé teszteletlen karakter jóvoltából) végelen ciklusban tudtam (volna) szerezni a pénzt (mondjuk ez önmagában is kicsit fura), de így az élen álló kénytelen volt a lehető legrövidebben befejezni, a saját akcióit is beáldozva, és ezzel agyonvágva a játékot, aminek kb. az 1/4-e így kimaradt. Szerintem ez nagyon béna a végén. Szóval egész jó lehetett volna, de van benne pár nagyon amatőr dolog, kár érte, mert a fejlesztgetős része tetszik.

Typical civilization game with all the kwown ingredients : but it plays fast and is easy to learn. It needs some more plays to find the depths. At this moment Nations seems to be more clear.

Trotz einiger Mängel ist Goldene Zeitalter insgesamt ein sehr gefälliges Spiel. Die vielen Karten sowie die dank der Kontinentplättchen stets anders aussehende Weltkarte sorgen für ausreichend Interaktion und auch dafür, dass die einzelnen Partien immer anders ablaufen. Mir hat's auch in jeder Besetzung gut gefallen, und vor allem zu zweit spiele ich immer wieder gerne eine schnelle 60-Minuten-Runde!

Introduced as a Civ-Fast, this was an accurate description. Perhaps not as random as the blind tile and card draws would indicate, there is still a tendency for chance to sit pat or slap you in the face. The blind end game goals don't really make much difference but killer combo's do have a significant impact.

A wide end game point spread and not a game I'd rush to play again.

Civilization games have a special place in my hearth. It’s something about them that is more than sum of its part. Maybe it is that Civilization games retell the greatest story ever told, the story of man. Among my favorite civ games are Through the Ages, Civilization, Sid Civ and Clash of Cultures (and 7 wonder but that’s another story). These games fix the civ fix for me, but are on the long side and highly interactive and confrontational. Modern euro game typically doesn’t give the civ fix but give a euro feel where you get to optimize to se who ends up on the top. Welcome to The Golden Ages, a Euro with civ theme. But wait, with the expansion it now gives the civ fix! 

To fix my civ fix I want to have the tools to tell my own story, with all the extra content in Cults & Culture expansion that is now possible. Before the expansion I felt that what I did was not unique. But now with the added content I can specialize in my own tech tree, play style and have a high amount of verity. My civ can now be the agriculture experts, the warmongers or the cultural. The games is now more asymmetrical and is still confrontational in a controlled manner. The gameplay feels little bit like Argent consortium another favorite of mine. There is a mix of euro mechanics and American thematic mechanics. This mix make an awesome game! The golden age is now my favorite civ game on 4-5 players! The game plays smooth and fast. Turns are intense and every decision counts. The game is close to perfect. 

Some mechanics are ingenious like how you spread your cults.  I give you so you can give me mechanics are fascinating. In this game the decision to spread my cult has historical implications that are thematic. If Civ religion spreads to your city your city will be worth more points, I get points and you get points for it. So zero sum between us. But there is a catch. My points are permanent and yours are temporary. So what this mechanic does it that it entice war. So in the act of giving a gift I also give you a curse. Beautiful!

RATING: 6
A light mid weight Euro Civ game that employs tech trees, limited combat and interesting combos. It is sort of a race game as you are trying to get your engine revving quicker than your opponents. 

Some of the aspects that I enjoyed were the different viable routes that the players can take as far as strategies are concerned and still be competitive. Also, the fact that you can pass and get money when your turn comes around again; it makes other player's decisions more tense as you don't want your opponents making money. 

I was a little turned off by how you determine player order and some of the tiny icons that need a reference manual to decipher, but it is nothing major that detracts heavily from the game. 

It plays fast for a Civ game albeit with some meat taken off the bone. Although it is streamlined, it still retains a certain appeal and you get a sense of accomplishment when you are done. 

Call me crazy, but I enjoy the artwork and the graphic design! All in all, a nice interesting game just above a gateway game that plays quickly, has some interesting decisions and has a certain charm to it.

This is the perfect combination of elegant design, lots of choices with multiple paths to VP, and balanced player interaction.  And the game pulls all of this off, yet plays so quickly that I immediately want to play it again!  The first time we played we spent almost more time talking about the game afterwards than actually playing the game! This is a very fun and memorable gaming experience.  Highly recommended!

RATING: 4
Disappointed with this, it's very dry and too euro for me. There are too many instances where theme is sacrificed.

Actions don't feel any different from age to age, so I don't feel any build up or development, depending on player actions wheat might be scored in era 1 or 4, and worth the same VP ... all a bit 'odd'. I also don't much like the idea of having all 4 leaders at the start and then deciding if you use them or keep them - that doesn't work for me thematically, call them something other than leaders at the very least (also it feels weird being Chinese in era 1 and then French in Era 2 ... what's that all about?).

I'm not totally convinced the game is balanced, or rather the combinations of some leaders/buildings/wonders etc can be over powered, which is a bit irritating as you get the 4 leaders at the start and know you're being forced down a route you'd rather not go, or that they're going to click without any clever thought from you.

I'd have preferred to just draft them at the start of each era, so you don't know in advance what they all are.

Having the end game bonuses at the start also doesn't work for me theme wise (even assuming they're in any way balanced), at least themed in the way they are. And the building the map/explore thing doesn't work for me either, I'd prefer either build it at the start (the world is fixed) or build it at the start but 'hidden' and then you explore revealing it in your turn. 

So overall, probably fine as a euro-game where you're looking to build an efficiency VP engine, but falls flat for me as a civilization game.

Not really a Civ game as much as a resource optimization Euro with light interaction. The tech tree is elegant, choices are interesting, the kitchy "old-timey" art is cool, and even if there's nothing really new here, everything still fits smoothly together. I like how actions are only limited by players themselves, with the "Golden Ages" benefits providing pressure for them to end the age. I also like how powerful some of the nations and later techs are, which somehow seem to balance each other out (more plays will put this to the test).

RATING: 7
A really solid little civ-lite game.

In Golden Ages, players take a phase building the map of the world, and then a phase doing stuff to score points from that world.  Players can occupy spaces of the map, develop their tech tree in order to better exploit the map, and build buildings and wonders that will do various things for them.

There's a lot of replayability here, as every game, players will get a different series of leader, different buildings will be available, different scoring options will be available, etc.

It's also significantly different from many of the other civ based games out there, and delivers a satisfying take on the theme in around 90 minutes.

Talk about streamlining! The Golden Ages has all the elements I enjoy in Civilization games (particularly tech trees, wonders, buildings, and map expansion), and plays so quickly and so smoothly. Sure, it isn't as deep as a true Civilization game, but figuring out the right combination of your Civilization, the available buildings and wonders, and which tech to go for can really end up singing a multitude of points, and makes you feel like you really accomplished something.

RATING: 7.5
Pros:
It’s a great lighter civilization game that plays in 60-90 minutes, so it does fill a niche as most civilization games takes at least 2-3 hours to play. The game is actually quite streamlined; you can only do a few different things which are all easily understandable, so the gameplay is elegant – but definitely not simple as you’re presented with a couple of critical choices! 

I also like the tech tree, although I would prefer slightly more techs and techs that are a little different; however, I also appreciate the tightness and cleanliness of only 16 techs. But it does mean that the replayability is at least somewhat limited, but an expansion will probably fix that.

The fact that military is not that important is a huge plus in my book – the horror example is Through the Ages, a game I do like, but a game I also HATE for the way they handle the military aspect of the game (which is way too important).

The four different leaders in the four ages is also neat – special powers/abilities is always a good thing, and you can plan your strategy around those leaders if you want. The bonus goals are also a feature I enjoy, even though some are easier to fulfill than others, especially with few players (for instance those where you need to control a certain type of resource compared to for instance the military goal card, which is actually a somewhat weird card as you might be guaranteed NOT to win it if any other player gets in combat four times).

So all in all there are many reasons why I like this game. It plays in a short amount of time and plays smoothly; there isn’t that much to do each round, but it still feels like a “real” civilization game in which there are no easy decisions! But there are also a couple of things I dislike:


Cons:
It’s a little too loose with 2; there isn’t much fighting going on, the continent consists of fewer tiles, and it seems to be too easy to develop nearly all/all technologies.

One of my major complaints with any game is the amount of luck – if there is too much luck involved I’m immediately turned off. In The Golden Ages there isn’t much luck, but one aspect is nothing but luck – the military tokens… After you’ve won a battle you get to draw a token which can be worth anything between 2 and 6 points! I’m personally going to remove the 2 and the 6 tokens just to mitigate the luck somewhat, but in general I simply hate this kind of luck of the draw which can win or lose you the game! I do understand the reasoning behind this; the designer probably wanted to have at least some of the points hidden just so the players can’t count the exact number of points each player has. But it’s still something I don’t like.

I’m not very fond of the rule stating that the game ends the turn after any one player has passed… This means that you might have a grand plan, but if just one player doesn’t have an “engine” or a big plan, you might not be able to take advantage of your own plan. I.e. if one player just uses his three meeples and then passes because e.g. he doesn’t have much money for advancing a tech or something like that, your plans can shatter… So be very careful of this! I do understand the design choice behind this, but I think it emphasizes that you need to do a lot of your actions in the third age, at least if one player seems to be behind and not capable of doing much.

A minor complaint is the graphical design choice; I personally don’t like the look of the game, and the miniature heads on the wonders was a bad choice as they are almost impossible to see.

In general I would love if there were even more wonders (so it’s not just the same four that appear in each age), more techs and more buildings. I know that this will be available in a future expansion here in 2015, and I’m looking very much forward to that!


Despite the fact that I’ve written a lot of negatives, they aren’t that crucial, and I still enjoy the game immensely due to the positives factors I described above.

The gameplay was difficult to get down at first, but the game is easier to play than it looks. Basically, It is a streamlined Civ game that plays in 90 minutes or less. Most of the cards are used in the game so there's not much diversity between games from the cards. There are many paths to score points and some difficult decisions to make.

RATING: 7
So, a civ game that plays in 1.5 hours? Well... it's a good game, but it feels more like a streamlined Euro tech game, but not so much a civ game. Still, I enjoyed my play of this game and I'd certainly play it again.

Why not a civ game? I dunno... war feels very abstracted, and in fact the board feels more like Euro area control than proper civ game. With money as the only real resource in the game, you lose a bit of that civ feel as well. Wonders and leaders have such abstracted effects that it's probably the final nail in the coffin from keeping this a proper civ game.

That's not to suggest it's a bad game! There's plenty of decisions to make in a short time frame. I did enjoy this ultimately.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely a shorter civ game compared to most and I did enjoy it but was not overly impressed by it. Now maybe that is because my first play was with the expansion and there seemed to be more going on than I anticipated. I like the idea of limited actions, but the game scales so quickly over the 4 rounds you can end up doing a lot with only the 3 workers that you have each round. I want to play again without the expansion, but I'm not sure it's one I absolutely need to own. For a civ game to me you can't beat Deus in my mind.

RATING: 4
A game whose design reminds me, in various ways, of Endeavor, Homesteaders, Keyflower, and Civilization. Civilization is obvious because of the subject matter; Endeavor because of the personal little tile tableau; and the other two because the game is too short for balanced long-term development: this is a drag race. Play at optimum efficiency straight away or lose, it's that simple.

I do not enjoy this sort of thing very much. A major part of the attractiveness of the design is in working out the various methods of tackling the drag race available to you as player, but if you don't play such a game often then... well, I guess it's just a lot of hot exhaust gasses and screaming engines for the sake of hot gas and lots of decibels. For what it's worth, I liked the gentle playing rythm which seems nicely put together; I'm not sure about curbing the attack-action though, and what is up with the randomness in the fame chits...? I suppose it serves some purpose, but I'll admit to having no clue as to why. And now that I think of it, there were a few other quirky things which had me raising my eyebrows. One is the stupid price iconography on top of wonders. Whose idea it was to have leaders the size of an ant as an indicator of whether the discount is applicable to him needs to be boxthwapped rather thoroughly. With the designer's edition of Ogre, that is. The other quirks seem to have evaporated from my mind over time, or could be attributed to not playing correctly (like for example ignoring the fact that you can only call a Golden Age the moment all your colonists are laying down). 

All in all I think it a friendly package with what appears to be a well-designed and -developed game in its class. Although I have currently no intention of playing it more (not because on its own it is bad, but because there are other titles I like more which are already pressed for table time), I'll be lenient with the rate for the time being.

[b]Update[/b] The game currently features in a x &times; y-challenge, and after the first few skirmishes I already find having to retract some of the above. For one thing there is no real way in why you can play optimally... and the reason is the other thing: the game's Achilles' heel, insufferable randomness. Randomness in how the land tiles come out, how the leaders come out, how the judge of history-cards come out, how the war chits come out, how the buildings come out. Where you feel you have some control over the first two rounds, the last two become a shameless point-grabbing exercise devoid of finesse or deliberation. You committed to a certain idea, and now have to see it through until the end, with all sorts of chaotic events preventing or perhaps aiding you in obtaining the various VPs, simply because you're incapable of changing that idea at this point in time. It sours me considerably on the whole... with a predictable lowering of my rate as a consequence. I shall be glad to be done with this title.

Notes:

Like a friend of mine said, it feels like a combo between Nations and Troyes. I do feel that leaders don't seemed balanced and can skew the game. The expansions adds some complexity to the game. One can easily get  caught up playing in your own little sandbox if one is not careful, Prudent to be observant and to watch for the opportunity to deny another player. Overall a great experience and believe with some minor adjustments can become a firm favourite.

RATING: 5
Conflict is interestingly implemented, and highly worthwhile to do at least once or twice, which makes the defense-ish powers much more worthwhile, which is good.

Some weirdness in how resources help - often it's only when acquiring them, rather than having them, which makes teching up for resources you already have oddly irrelevant at times.

Otherwise: acceptable, but didn't really grab me.

Dry civilisation game that felt too jagged for me to really sink into.  The icons are tiny and difficult to read, the tech tree is inviting in concept but samey in execution due to the cost spread, and the randomly-drawn variable-point victory tokens feel out of place in a medium-heavy euro.

Quick civilization style game over four rounds. Player created board, turn order determined by randomly dealt leaders with varying benefits. Public goals listed for all players but chosen only by first to pass means that there is a level of risk-reward in terms of passing first. Money to passed players per additional round allows for some catch up. Additional elements of area control and tech tree makes for a highly competitive game. Tight game design. Snowball effect and not forgiving play.

Art style is really bland but functional. Component quality is average.

I was pleasantly surprised by The Golden Ages. When I decided to buy it after reading some good reviews and watching Rahdo's Runthrough, I still wasn't sure if I could get it to the table more than once. Maybe it would be too much of a euro for my group, maybe I would hate the attacking. Now that I've tried it with one of my gaming buddies, the outlook is positive. The game has a lot of clever ideas. I like the quick "I go, you go" action structure, the variable round length which created some really tense situations and even the tech tree, which looked a little bland at first, allows very different play styles. Even the mid- and end-game scoring, which I feared would be to abstract for my ameritrash-loving friends, worked for both of us. During the whole game, we weren't sure who was in the lead and this really racked up the tension. Even the attacking didn't really bother me, since it didn't really destroyed my infrastructure and burned my empire to ashes.

To sum it up: I can't wait to get The Golden Ages to the table again and I guess this is also true for my gaming buddy. If I would rate the game now, it would get an 8.

Map-based Civilisation game with lots of moving parts. The Culture track (from the Cults & Culture expansion) played surprisingly loosely, adding a race element to the game requiring the management of actions that require a Colonist versus those that don't. Military/aggression is pleasingly low-key, with no necessary arms race.

Players are guiding themselves through four eras of civilization growth.  A very nice civ-lite game that firmly keeps a grip on it's Euro roots.  Clean mechanics, very well developed, plays smoothly, yet retains a nice civ feel with a technology tree, a spatial element on the board, and interesting cards (wonders, buildings and nation powers).  Sits firmly on the Nations level of civ game complexity, but this feels much cleaner and better.  Liked it a lot.

[b][FirstImpressionOn25thNOV2014][/b] I enjoy this one a lot! This is a civilization game, but it's nothing like the standard fare. This is a VERY Euro civ game, with bland artwork and super dry game. I can definitely see this is not for everyone because of what I just said.

But I enjoyed it a lot. The artwork is done by Alexander Roche's, whom his work I'm very fond of. The civ feel only touches the surface, so it's nothing too deep. The game plays in two-hours or less, plays quick IMO. 

A lot of VP sourcing, and I enjoyed this part a lot - there's just plenty of ways to get VP.


Orleans, Abraca...what?, The Golden Ages, Deus and Panamax are my favorite games so far from Spiel'14 crop.

The search for a satisfying lightish short civ game may finally have come to an end.  The Golden Ages is fast, interesting, and very well-balanced.  Conflict is present but minimal in its impact, and there is always too much to do and not enough time.  I prefer it to Nations as it plays in half the time, is less card-dependent, and just flows well like a calmly meandering river.  There maybe replayabilty issues after a few games, but given that I rarely play an individual game more than a handful of times I doubt I will hit that time.  I really enjoyed the game.  This, Deus and Castles of Mad King Ludwig are my current faves from Essen 2014.

Great area control game.  The mechanics are easy to learn, decisions are difficult, outcomes are clear.  You have to keep your eyes on what everyone is doing and decide whether you need to hang back for a bit and bide your time, or pounce and seize the moment.  And you get to make a map!

The gamplay is as good as any of the other area control heavyweights.  It seems to fall down in the presentation and artwork departments though.  It presentation marks it as a civilization game.  While it has the theme of civilization, the main thrust of the game is scoring and collecting income from controlled points on the map.  You get points for doing other things during the game, but all those other things eventually lead back to and revolve around  controlling resources.  So yeah, it's a civ game, but with a pretty sharp focus on area control.  Those looking to play a civ game might be a little thrown off, as this feels like a slightly different take on the civ theme.

The art in this game is going to turn a lot of people off.  I'm into it, but my wife said it looked like a high school art project.  For many, there will be nothing eye catching here, which means selling it to a group of gamers spoiled by Asmodee production values is going to be met with some resistance.  If you're not into the art, there's really nothing about this game that screams, "Play Me!"  There are a whole bunch of icons to figure out and the game bits have nothing special going on.  It's a rough game to pitch.

You could bill it as a 60-90 minute civ game and get some interest, but the game feels so area control when you play it that some might be dissapointed.  

It's an excellent game, but a tough sale.

2017-07-21 : first play and this instantly became my favorite Civ game. It has all the flavour - leaders, buildings, wonders, exploration, war, just the right amount of interactivity - and manages this all in a streamlined engine that allows very different strategies to compete with each other. There are some minor layout / graphics issues, but overall a very solid game.

It does feel like a Civ game to me, but a euro civ game. Combat is not the focus and it plays in a reasonable time. 4X right?

1) Explore: Each round, people take a tile and add it to the board, which displays icons. You can move your 'base of operations' in this phase. 

2) Exploit/Expand: You can move to the icons on the map to control them which is generally for money or VP purposes. Money is used to buy wonders and technology, which make you better at things or allow you to do more actions in a turn. You use your workers to do actions, though some actions don't require workers. You can use workers to acquire buildings (for non-worker actions) or to generate vp. 

3) Exterminate: You can only attack 4 times in the entire game and it becomes increasingly expensive to do so. Victory is automatic. You are rewarded for attacking with VP and the ability to take control of icons on the map.

People have asymmetrical civs and each round, you can keep your current civ or upgrade into a new one. Civs give each player a minor power and can make some wonders easier to acquire. People also have an overreaching goal that's hidden from other players that provide VP if you succeed (usually the most money, wonders, tech, etc.) There is a nice tension to the rounds because the first person to pass, chooses the scoring method for that particular round from a pool of scoring cards that are used in the game and players who pass are rewarded money while other players stay in it (like Troyes).

It all works well and good. You don't use all of the cards every game. I think the one place the game really could have used more variety is the buildings. I've only played it with 4 thus far, but people say the 2 player games works well. There is an expansion coming which I'm sure will add more variety. So far, I like it.

Reminded me a lot of Tempus. A game masquerading as a civilization builder. It is fine, but never really develops beyond a few simple choices.

While I am a fan of pictograms, this game has way too many needless ones, in an attempt to make it feel deeper than it really is.

Not a civ game and fairly flat resource management worker placer.

This is a good, shorter, civ building game.  I liked the 3 worker limit.  The artwork was a bit early-2000s euro for me, and the out of the box wonders/leaders are all used up in a couple of games, but other than that, this is a solid civ game.

Közepesen bonyolult működésű és tolerálható játékidejű civ építés. Ritka az ilyen. Cserébe azért elég absztrakt, de nagyon tetszik, hogy mennyi agyalni kombinálni való ad, viszonylag kevés akciólehetőséggel. Érdekes ötlet a kipasszolásos, pontozós mechanizmus. Ritka az olyan játék, ahol valós lehetőség az extrém rövid körök abszolválásával való előnyszerzés. Itt szerintem az, de ezt még próbálgatni kell.
Az ikonrednszere szerintem nem sikerült olyan jól, de szerencsére a szabály gyakorlatilag mindenre kitér, ami kérdéses lehet. A grafika sem az a szemet gyönyörködtető, nem az én stílusom.

The Golden Ages is a very streamlined civilization game. In a way, that is, of course, a contradiction in terms and, unsurprisingly, it shows. If you go into the game expecting an epic 4X experience, you'll come away disappointed because the game is really more of a limited engine builder with a civ paint job.

If that is the premise, however, the game works quite admirably. The random leader and goal cards being dealt have a strong influence on your game, and just making the best out of what is presented to you each turn is a large part of the game. It is far more tactical than strategic but it also plays fairly quickly and timing is often more important than raw power.

Regelschlankes Euro-Civ, das sich am Ende fischmaulartig öffnet: die letzte der vier Runden dauert gefühlt solange wie die ersten drei zusammen. Und dennoch spielt sich GA für ein Civ relativ kurz. Über eine klassische Entwicklungstafel versucht man in jeder Runde drei Meeple-Aktionen auf dem Brett gewinnbringend zu nutzen und mit Hilfe von Wundern, Gebäuden und wechselnden Völkern (!) geschickt zu verzahnen. Der Kniff: wer zuerst in der Runde passt und das namensgebende GOLDENE ZEITALTER ausruft, bestimmt die Rundenwertungskarte für alle. Überhaupt spielt Timing eine zentrale Rolle in diesem  Spiel, das seinen eigenen Stil und Rhythmus hat, der es in beiden Sektoren, Euro und Civilization, blattgoldschimmernd hervorhebt.

Nice components, nice art.  This is one of the most streamlined civilization-building games.  At first, there appears to be a lot going on, but really, you're limited in your number of actions, so you really can't do more than a handful of moves.  It keeps the game moving along and keeps it from dragging on too long.

In the "you can plan far ahead but then play very tactically" vein I am pretty sure I would rather play Keyflower.

Explaining the entire tech tree before playing was necessary but just underscores my feeling of this being a little more trouble than it's worth.

The random glory points sucks. I hate it when randomness chooses who wins. I don't like the civ cards with the abilities, I would remove that. In fact, there are lots of things I don't like in this game even though it has a certain fun to it.

It's simple, but shallow. Always the same cards and buildings over and over again. This game has a short life.

I like how you build the map. Also, unlike Patchistory, you feel like making a civilization a bit, well, much more than that other game which is like a hardcore carcassonne where no one can block you but yourself.

The Golden Age is not the best game out there, but I bet some people might get some fun out of it...

But Advance Civilization remains the king of all Civilization games. :)

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: joc de "civilitzacions" de 2h, molt eurogame. Té tecnologies, maravelles, exploració, gestió de recursos, conflicte, objectius secrets i objectius de final de partida. Es juga en 4 eras i en cada era cada jugador va executant accions intercaladament (explorar, fundar ciutats, construir, etc...). Al final de la partida es comproven els objectius i el jugador amb més punts guanya.

No m'ha deixat mala sensació, però hi han algunes coses que em tiren cap enrere... El tema de poder pasar i que guanyis or cada torn extra que els altres jugadors facin em sembla molt original. També tindre una habilitat especial cada era i poder decidir entre la nova i l'antiga m'agrada (a més, les veus totes al principi del joc, de manera que pots planificar una mica). Les cartes d'objectiu públic m'agraden i em recorden als events de la III era del TtA (tot i que aquí son visibles).

Tot i això, em dona la sensació de que el tema no està gaire aconseguit. Que un jugador pugui atacar un altre sense que aquest pugui fer res per evitar-ho no em convenç, igual que poder moure la teva capital cada torn. A més, els edificis i les maravelles son molt genérics. La gestió de recursos tampoc m'agrada massa, es tracta de "controlar" un recurs, no de "recolectarlo", de manera que només et dona el seu benefici la primera vegada que col·loques un meeple sobre ell (no se si pots entrar i sortir cada torn de la loseta per poder activar el benefici, però em semblaria ridícul...)

En definitiva, m'agradaria poder provarlo per tindre una opinió més formada, però crec que no m'agradaria tant com per tenirlo a la ludoteca (en aquest sentit em recorda al Sylla, les mecàniques m'agraden, però no el suficient).

I've played this a few times and I like it less each time.  It is too fiddly for my taste as it seems like we have to refer to the rules a lot and peruse BGG as to rules for card interactions.  I'm not a big fan of the build-a-map aspect of the game and I don't like that you can attack other players.  It always seems to take 2+ hours to play even for experienced players.  I'm willing to play this occasionally but it is not one that I want to own.

Solid game that for some reasons doesn't leave me satisfied at the end of the game as it should. Maybe because I have a feeling of going a pre-established path instead of working out my own strategy. Maybe because there's not a real territorial feeling despite having a map. Or maybe because of the dull art.

I have so mixed feelings about this game. I'd totally try it again, just not anytime soon.... but not so much later that I forget the rules.

Money is tight--it seems the only way to get more money is to settle new places on the board or to pass and hope everyone else doesn't pass. (after you pass, you collect 2 coins every time it would have been your turn). If you don't have some plan to work around not having very much money (ie: a plan to get more of it!) you are probably going to be in trouble.
Oh but you need points too to actually win. Caramba!

I am not a big fan of civilization games, and I find this light enough to be fun, and complex enough to be interesting. After the first Age you feel like you will have not enough time to start any strategy, but miracously you start building your own world, and just when you feel you can dominate it... the game ends, and you want to play again. 
I am not very fond of the graphics; I like the illustration on the cover and the cards, and I think the icons are clear enough, but something in the board and tiles looks unpolished to me (I cannot explain it better, sorry!).

Decent and smooth design with several clever ideas.
Most notably the timing of your actions is brilliantly developed: when you pass early while others still act not only you earn money when the turn comes back to you, but you also get to choose the goal which will be scored for the current era.

Still, not my type of the game (I'm not a fan of technology tracks in general and the replayability can be an issue here too).  Hence the '6' rating.

The readability of the civ discount icons on the wonders is scandalous.

Interesting game. I like how you can sort of customize your race by choosing which research lines to go down, and I like that getting attacked doesn't seem so damaging. Also I feel like this game does secret goals better than most since it seems unlikely that someone would accidentally beat you out of your secret goal unless they were playing pretty poorly, and they're usually things that you can customize your race to be best at. Also it should play pretty fast. That said it's not the most thinky or clever game, but it's a solid fun time.

Solid game; I agree with my local group that it's probably better than Historia.  It still fails to hold my attention because it's too streamlined for me.  I got more of a generic Euro than a civ game feel.  

Lesson learned, I'll try any civ-light but if it's lighter than Through the Ages level I won't go in with high expectations.

Civilization in 90 streamlined minutes. Sweet! Now first off: I dislike [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameartist/12282/alexandre-roche]Alexandre's[/url] art, but that is personal taste. The game has language independent icons, but unfortunately some functionality was lost because of iconography. Just look at the [url=http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2222495_md.jpg]two millimeter icons[/url] on the wonder cards. But don't let artwork and iconography shy you away from this game. This is a great euro game with everything a civilization game needs: leaders, wonders, buildings, technology tracks and war. It offers a great optimization puzzle. Although your leader card can steer your strategy a bit, there is still a lot of strategy to explore in this game.

RATING: 8
A casual glance at The Golden Ages would have you believe this is s civilization game. You can take on the persona of an ancient or modern civ, explore, build buildings, wonders and cities. You can develop technologies in levels of increasing cost and abilities. However, the game is more abstracted than most civ games and lacks some key features. Even though you can develop technologies, there is no tech tree with diverging paths. There is no population growth, just the same three action pawns (called colonists) all through the game. There is only one resource - money. Combat exists, but it is simply a payment leading to automatic victory up to four times in the game. This is a medium-weight euro in civ clothing. It is a good euro. Everything fits well together and it's an enjoyable play, but it's not a civ game.

The game is played over four eras. At the beginning of each era, players draw and add tiles to the the game board, expanding the area where your action pawns can activate. The squares on the board show different resources, but resources are only collected in the form of money and only to the degree that your identity, technologies, and wonders allow. With money as the only resource, most things in the game cost money to acquire - although some acquisitions are at the expense of an action. Technologies are single track, four-level advancements of increasing cost which improve action pawn movement, cube (city) placement, resource payouts, and building capacity among other benefits. You can acquire buildings for actions and wonders for money. Buildings provide additional action options and wonders provide a one-time or ongoing benefit. You can acquire points in various ways throughout the game. Most points after four eras wins.

I have a bias for spatially-oriented games. What sets this one apart for me is the map that gets assembled throughout the game. Your action pawn can drop cities as they move around, but the map mostly becomes a field of action options that becomes more flexible as you increase your movement technology. Manipulating the board space and playing with all the levers that influence it is why I like this game. It is not an inspiring or ground-breaking design by any means, but I find the game play most enjoyable.

文明發展遊戲總是令人感覺抽象，畢竟用幾個小時的時間歷經整個文明的起落是需要一點想像力，況且一個文明發展總是有許多的變數，像是富饒的土地或是軍事的威脅，不同遊戲的差異就在於對哪個部分著重一些，或是哪個部分影響較大。
The Golden Ages 黃金時代 算是不難理解的文明遊戲，我想近幾年許多作者都嘗試著把這類文明發展的題材做的更直觀更容易上手，The Golden Ages 算是不錯的佼佼者，玩家歷經四個時期，每個時期都可以選擇是否改朝換代，並拿到新統治者的獎勵，遊戲並將所有卡片功能及動作圖示化，簡單易懂，科技爬升的概念也是文明發展不可或缺的部分，在遊戲中主要用金錢來取得科技的進步，因此建立好賺錢的系統形成一個重要的策略，但卻不僅僅只是賺錢就能獲勝，玩家必須思考的是文明發展的選擇，順位的影響，建築物和奇蹟的功能加分，以及每回合選擇計分的優勢，我覺得這是這個遊戲做的很棒的平衡點~

A civ-light game with a map! It feels very much like a Euro, it's hard to hurt your opponents too much (which is a good thing in my books). It's a bit of point salad design, players are encouraged to diversify by end game scoring cards received at the start of the game. Different techs exist, but player's boards seemed pretty similar by end-game. The only real currency in the game is gold, you earn it and then spend it on VPs in various ways. The promise of variability has me excited to try it again, but I'm concerned that the game won't deliver in a meaningful way.

RATING: 8
Successful blend of civ game and euro. The game is played through four eras. At the start of the game the player gets dealt one civ card with a special ability for each era. The ability is not game-breaking but either provides a boost to efficiency if utilized or grants a one-off benefit. Players can develop their civ in four tech trees, each consisting of four consecutive technologies. The final technology in each tech tree grants a VP bonus based on the board presence. Planning for these techs is a main source for VPs. Others are wonders and the scoring cards which are open from the beginning but only one is selected per era by the player who passes first.

While explanation of the many individual techs and cards needs some time, gameplay is smooth and quick without serious downtime. On their turn, players choose one out of eight actions. Half of them need a settler (out of three per player) limiting the number of turns. There’s one aggressive action with a random reward but it fits in thematically and can in parts be prepared for. Most eurogamers should be fine with it. The tech trees combined with the special ability and the different scoring cards for the game ask for strategic planning. Player approaches will be different, replayability is a given. A good, potentially really good game.

Civlight that actually isn't that civ, but instead more of an engine building game. A lot of thought has gone into the mechanisms and the game is good. The tech tree very much reminds me of Eclipse and the overall feel with the game's not so typical graphics, style and theme then reminds me of Nations. The map system is really good and the golden age action to balance the game is somewhat lame. I very clearly prefer Nations to this.

A civilization building Euro game. For me this outshines many other civ games. It works like a well oiled machine. It just runs along smoothly and fast. At the same time it is filled with interesting choices. Military is an important element but it's also restricted enough that it cannot dominate the game. Unfortunately it looks very bland. But once you got past the looks you discover a truely great game.

This is not a civilization game, it is an euro optimization game. The theme is there just to confuse the rules, because the theme does not make sense in several cases. Despite all the beef, I liked that each round the scoring card is chosen by the player who passed first.

An entertaining game of leveraging your civilization(s) to explore and control territories, build wonders and buildings, and develop technologies to aid in the process.  Attacking is not too painful for the victim and gets more and more expensive for the attacker.  The artwork ranges from pleasantly old-fashioned (technology tiles) to not very attractive (buildings, wonders, and judgement cards).

Good game that I'd definitely like to play again.  Not sure if it will go on the to-buy list.

Wow. This piece of work. I don't know where to start.

The game looks worse than your average Martin Wallace, which says something. Components range from average to ugly, are badly designed, and are in no way intuitive in what they do. The symbols are the worst, and you pretty much need to check every single card, building, wonder, and whatnot from the rules, since they generally don't to anything remotely like the card says. Rules are poorly written, leave out ton of information and are generally very vague. Setup takes ages and it eats up more space than any normal table provides.

So, the game play. Our Via Dolorosa -experience lasted for over five hours (five players, with expansion), and after the first age I was begging we torch this abomination and play something meaningful. The worst thing aside from the rules and general mess is the ridiculous lack of balance ANYWHERE in the game. There are buildings where the players who manage to snatch them round 1 can use them to generate ~10 money on the first turn, where others are left with picking berries at 2 coins per action AND losing a worker action for that. Seems fair. Although, the game continues to spew broken things on the table every age, so it kind of balances things out. In theory, anyway. If you get the first broken things, you will have an advantage in the game which naturally pushes you towards being the starting player, and thus allowing you to cherry pick the most broken things again and again. If this happens early on, and you sit to the right of the leading player, your game is practically over. I'd recall the starting player didn't change once, and the person who kept it won, and all the remaining places were distributed in clockwise order from the starting player. Point difference between first and last was roughly 100 points.

All in all, this descend to madness was pretty close to being the worst boardgaming experience of my life, and the second game ever that I'll absolutely refuse to play ever again no matter what (Junta was the first, but that game might actually be fun for one play). I'll give additional 0,75 stars for not being technically very broken, aside from the rules and balance.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

First play was quite interesting even if it was more of an exploration of the cards and such. I'm certain we did not play well overall and we would all play quite differently next time. Some of the leaders feel quite powerful - more so than others. I was also frustrated holding an end game bonus card that fate largely dictated would never occur for me unless I worked against better strategy which was annoying. Still, this felt like a solid CIV game that plays in under 2 hours. One doesn't really get the epic feel of CIV, but there is technology, expand, explore, and exterminate (well, to a limited extent).  The conflict/exterminate piece is also a bit on the random side and I'm not sure how I feel about that - when you fight, you automatically win and draw a random chip worth 2-6 points. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Cool light-civ with an interesting tech tree and a progressively revealing map. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that you start with only three "dudes" and that's what you have for the entire game. One of the things I enjoy about civilization games is seeing my population spread through the world, and I miss that feeling in Golden Ages. It's still fun, though.

I love the look of this game, and I'm always interested in "distilled" civ games. The gameplay, however, wasn't great. One player, with a single card purchase, got into what seemed like an insurmountable lead, and there didn't seem to be any way to close the gap. I'm not a hater on randomness, but the seemingly unbalanced leaders and wonders, along with their random distribution, looks like it can really tilt the game towards one player and away from another for no good reason. (I also hate hate hate the random-chit-draw-for-victory-points mechanism here, in which the same action is randomly worth 2-6 VPs for, again, no good reason.) Most the the parts of this game aren't bad and are even clever, but as a whole it seems to fall apart. That said, knowing now how things unfold I would try it again.

RATING: 7
A very streamlined 'civilisation' game that plays fast even with all new players. The combat and tech tree is quite abstract and may not meet the expectations of normal 'civ' players. The actual problem lies with the graphic design: the icons of Wonder cards are way too small for players to see, and the functions of all powers are all difficult to recognise without frequently referencing the rules. We also played 1 rule wrong: the endgame is triggered as soon as 1 player passes and each other player would have 1 turn more, instead of all players pass.
BTW there are 2 easily forgotten rules apart from the one above, as mentioned by player Lucas Hedgren:
'1. You may not start a golden age unless all your colonists have been used.
2. In the last era, the game end is triggered when any one player starts a golden age.'

Update: Second game was with only parts of the expansion but with five players. The sweet spot may be parts of the expansion and 3-4 players. But what´s up with those oversized scoring tokens that don´t fit on the point track?

I was very keen to try this. After our first game (4-pl) I´m not sure what to think. I´d like to try it without the expansion. It probably added quite some playing time and also randomness in the order the culture cards come up. The last turn can be really anti-climactic if one player is far behind and decides to pass early. This may also result in some kingmaking.

After two plays, I feel like The Golden Ages likely has much more to offer than may be immediately apparent from its somewhat dry and austere surface. The relatively simple set of actions available to the players belies the subtle interactions that can arise between the interlocking elements of the game. In addition, I'd say there's a nice level of player interaction in the game that likely would grow as players become more experienced. Happily, you can't play this game with your head in the sand. Players must watch their opponents closely.

My favorite component of the game, though, is the cards. Players know from game start their potential path through the Civilizations they've been dealt as well as their end game scoring goal. The History's Judgement cards provide wonderful tension and competition around the scoring for each game round. I particularly like how these cards give the players some control over how and when each era is scored. In fact, I'd argue that the History's Judgement cards provide the core mechanism of the game around which everything else revolves; players who aren't at least partially playing towards these cards are likely going to struggle. 

On the negative side, I find the game strangely difficult to teach, especially given its relative simplicity. I guess I blame the wealth of icons and those subtle interactions I mentioned above. Also, the static nature of the Wonders makes me worry the game could become stale. Luckily there's already an expansion.

Ultimately an enjoyable experience that kept me thinking long after my plays. This is definitely a game I'd like to explore more.

EDIT (12/6/16): Months later and this is failed to come back out. I'd love to explore it more, especially with the expansion material, but I fear it will never see the table again.

I played this with a group that had previously played it one year ago, but not since. They were, however, supremely confident that they were across the rules.

Turns out, they weren't.

We played this to the end and it went quite well with the game demonstrating depth and aspects of interesting gameplay, but the last age seemed to go forever. The rule we got wrong was the way any player could end the game in the final age hence it just going so very, very l-o-n-g.

In the end, given that this mistake was so profound and it affected all players so significantly, we just decided to give up and not score it. As I didn't really played the game 'properly' I have elected not to score this game. 

That said, I would be up to play again, but probably wouldn't buy. I should also say, the game is done no favours by the appalling artwork.

Well, finally got a chance to play the game. Solid midweight Civ game.  Easy to teach rules, and about 2 hours to finish. I do like it, although I'm not sure its any better than Tempus, which I also own.  I enjoy both of them. Golden Ages has a bit more theme, and is more true to your typical Civ game features (i.e. wonders). Tempus requires a bit more thinking, and the battles are more interesting.  Still need to try the expansion for Golden Ages.

Meh. A Euro game masquerading as a civilization game. There are so few things to do for each action that the game almost dictates how you're going to play. Also, you have to look at the rule book rather than the cards to see what their names are. This is a major issue I have with games like this and Spyrium. It takes away from the theme considerably when they do this. I hate to say it, but this is the worst Civ game I've played in board game form to date.

I'm always looking for the Holy Grail of civilization games: a game that captures the epic feeling of games like Civilization and 7 Ages, yet play in a short time like Historia.

Nevertheless, I'll try Golden Ages if I get the chance.

Over four eras, your civilization advances. You start with 4 cards, one which can be used in the corresponding era. You can build wonders, buildings, explore and take control of territories. The era ends when someone has used all three of their meeples and they can choose a VP scoring card for the round. Each player also has a board denoting four different tracks to progress. Finally you start the game with a secret condition that if you meet will give you 8 VPs.

It's a game that plays quickly, and there are lots to consider. It's fun and very engaging. I'm looking forward to more plays.

It is very refreshing to play a full-fledged civ lite game which doesn't devolve into a light wargame just because one player wants it to.  It is not refreshing at all to play ANY kind of game that uses the atrocious victory point chit pull element, which can easily cause huge gaps in the fortunes of equally skilled players.  (To put it another way:  You launch two attacks and blindly grab a pair of 6-point tiles, while I launch two attacks and blindly grab a pair of 2-point tiles.  You now have three times as many points as I have, despite the fact that we both took the exact same actions.)  Also, the wonders are not balanced well, and some of the leaders grant one-time bonuses while others grant continuous special abilities, which can easily make the "decision" to change leaders a no-brainer.  On a good day I could be talked into playing this again, but I see nothing to admire about it.

RATING: 7
Quite a clever (and quick!) minimalistic civ game concept but has several rough edges that would have needed more tuning.

- Leaders and end game scoring cards given at the start of the game are completely random. Since the balance of the leaders does not seem very convincing, giving no options to choose from a larger selection does not sound like a good idea.

- All wonders are used in every game. Combined with the unsatisfactory turn order system and randomly distributed leaders, this means that it is way too easy to plan based on the next Era's wonders.

- Presentation of pricing information on the wonders is absolutely ridiculous and means constant double-checking of the card list. Other than that, Roche's artwork is excellent once again, and he has also improved his iconography: This time only the plus sign on the Era I wonders is a little confusing, since the '1 VP' after it is not related to the controlled resource at all.

- War VP tokens should really be "draw 2, keep 1" since the point distribution varies so wildly.

+ The end game trigger is not really a problem, since it guarantees that the fourth era lasts a minimum of four rounds. I actually quite like this method, and it is consistent with how the first three Eras force you to play efficiently.

- The Stronghold edition is baffling: They uglified the box, downgraded the player boards, and did not fix the layout of the wonder cards.

Gioco di civilizazione dove non manca quasi nulla ma si riesce a giocare in 60', in 90' le prime partite. Abbiamo evoluzione tecnologica, meraviglie, leader, espansione del territorio, guerre, alcune cose sono appena accennate ma il tutto si amalgama bene e il gioco risulta molto piacevole, oltre che strategico. Diciamo che The Golden Ages ha colto quanto si era prefissato.

RATING: 8.5
The right way to distil a multi-faceted Civ game into a manageable timeframe and box. For once, Roche's artwork is perfectly suited to the theme, and there is just about enough replayability in the variety of races available. The lack of typical Civ spreadsheetiness is a definite point in its favour.

[b]The Golden Ages[/b] was received in a math trade (2/1/15) then sold via auction 4/28/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]I haven't played many Civ games, but Golden Ages hits the sweet spot for me. Again each game you can choose a completely different approach to the game especially once you see which leaders you get. building the world as you play can drastically change how the game plays out, war is limited but can be powerful. In fact every action you take in this game is important, you can't afford to waste actions. To top it off it plays great at all player counts (2p is excellent) and it's quick (60 to 90 minutes depending on player count/experience). This is the game I most wish I got to play more, hopefully this year I'll have a chance to get it to the table more.[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Special thanks to [user=eekamouse]Joel Eddy[/user] for bringing this game to my attention during his top 10 games of 2014 video.

- I love the art and aesthetics of this game. It is a very clean/slick presentation with very clear iconography.
- This is the perfect Euro style civ building game, the rule set is quite intuitive and easy to learn.
- Perfect blend of in game and end game scoring, you are never quite sure how you are doing in the game [i](mostly due to your personal end game goal and the military vp)[/i].
- The tech tree might appear slightly generic, but wow does it offer tons of different strategies to explore. 
- Leaders, they all offer different perks and you get to choose whether or not you want to upgrade your leader each age.
- Declaring a Golden Age will net you 2 gold for every turn other players take after you, which really forces you to play as efficiently as possible (having gold in this game is very important because you pay to unlock techs and attack other players).

This game is amazing, I've played with 2 and 4 and it plays great at both player counts. This game is so easy to play, you do not have to remember all kinds of rules and exceptions. There is so much variety to be found in this game because all of the vp scoring cards (minus the wonders) change every game. Add on top of that the different leaders you get and the powers they offer will lead to your exploring another path to victory. [/i]

My rating is not for the rules as written as there are major flaws that kill the game. How the designer and publisher let the game be published in its current form is beyond me. 

The leaders are completely unbalanced, especially in the last age. 

The turn order is broken as first player always gets choice of strongest wonders and buildings. 

The ability to essentially rage-quit the fame by passing in the last age and in so doing trigger the last turn of the game is beyond comprehension. 

Draft the leaders, rotate the turn order in a way not tied to the leaders, and do away with the mindless end game trigger and you have a game with much to like.

One of those pasted-on-theme Euros that's works just fine, but seems just a bit too standard in its delivery. There's the required limited number of actions, and you explore a tech tree and building effects to maximise the contribution of each of your actions. At least it avoids the resources trope. There are neat aspects though - I particularly liked how you're limited to 4 attacks in the game, and each attack is more expensive than the previous, so they'd better be worth it. You have a secret quest to earn end-game VP's. There are end-round VPs to go for. It has a nice blend of sandbox vs interaction. Turn order seems rather crucial re who gets what buildings on offer, and also seems rather out of your control. I guess there's stuff enough to explore if it was in your collection, but it's got to get there first over other Euro options.

RATING: 6
"Solid 90-minute light-civ with a map. My main frustration is all the 'catch-22' situations it throws at you. If you do X, you won't get to do Y, and if you do Y, you won't get to do X. Moreso than even most worker placement. Conflict, while minimal for a civ game, is still stronger than I like."

What I like:
- Light civ with a (very nice looking) map
- Seem to be lots of paths to victory
- Relatively light on conflict
- Catch-up mechanisms
- Turns go quite quickly, and our 4p learning game only took 90 minutes

What I don't like:
- Too many "catch-22" situations
- Conflict is still a bit heavy for my pacifist tastes

The card draft and interactions with money and tech ended up being more frustrating than most worker placement games, in terms of needing to do 2 things, but knowing you wouldn't get to do the second one, and as a result neither one being all that helpful. Very tight, at least with 4 players. 

The end of each era sets up another lose-lose situation, where if you end first, you get to pick the bonus...but you are then vulnerable to others changing the board state so you won't benefit from it. But if you stay in longer, someone else will pick a bonus you can't benefit from. Argh. 

Generally I like some tightness, painful decisions, and needing to make the best of a bad situation. But in this game, probably because I was being squeeze by other players rather than by the game itself, I didn't like it. 

I would put the weight around 3.2 (higher than BGG voters), largely due to the overwhelming number of paths through the game. The rules are not complex at all (although I got tripped up by a couple fiddly exceptions).

Meh. Too much random luck. Wife got a couple nice leader combos and ran away with the game. Maybe better with 4 but then you still have random leaders. If you want to play a civ builder, go for something meaty, like nations. Nations doesn’t take much longer to play, but is infinitely more interesting and challenging.

Played it twice, without and once with Cults & Culture expansion. Without the expansion this is what it promises a "light" civilisation game. It feels though you "know" the game already after a few plays thus has low replayability. With the expansion it's not light anymore, when we tried it, with five players it added 2h compared to a four player game. The similarities with other games like Through the Ages and Nations are a bit to strong.

My final day at the Essen-fair, 1,5 hour before closing time. There is a table available at the Quined-booth. So I plant myself down. Golden Ages was there new release from whom I expected not a lot (in contradiction with AquaSphere and Massilia), probably also because of the very ugly artwork of Alexander Roche. We were also with only 2 players and it seemed to be better with more. But I must say that I was totally wrong!

This turned to be a fast civilisation game that also plays excellent with 2 and seems to have enough in it to have a good replayability.

I enjoyed this much more than I expected. Admittedly, I had pretty low expectations going in. I can see interesting decisions and trade-offs in there. It is all pretty abstracted, admittedly. 

For a lot of people, the 90min CIV game is a bit of a grail game dream. Of all the games out there that bill themselves as such, I think this one comes pretty close to pulling it off.... but if you want something like a '4X lite', just play Antike

A small civ game sounds good but the variety created by the goal cards and the different board placement didn't make it variable enough. It was also dull having only 2 kinds of resources (money and VP's). It would have been interesting if the resources on the board gave some kind of bonuses that were specific to them but they just felt like different money sources and it grew dull.

Nice and fast for a civ building game. I really enjoy the tech tree boards, and how each player is pursuing their own private goals while interacting on the main board. This is one of the few civ games where warfare doesn't seem so cutthroat or detrimental to the player losing pieces. Really, this is more of a racing game, where players try to build the best engine before the other players, because first to bow out of the current age gets to choose the bonus points card for the round and drastically swing the player scores in a new direction. The only problem with Golden Ages is that some strategies don't seem as balanced as others. For example, warfare has a very limited scope. Better served as a secondary objective than a main goal.

My favorite civilization game. Hits all the things I like about civ games (tech trees, resource acquisition, feeling of progress and escalation) without the snowballing leader and harshness (and simply unfun-ness) of most military aspects. Combat here is still beneficial to the attacker, but it is very costly as well, and the loser doesn't feel that much sting, and more importantly, doesn't get particularly set back in their plans. Oh, and it also does all this in like 90 minutes??   Yeah, it's real good.

A relatively light civ game with a shorter time foot print than most other civ games.  It was very fun.  I enjoyed the decisions I was able to make.  The ability for people to share spaces make for an interesting dynamic and suspense...because they might attack at some point.

I highly recommend this for people wanting a civ game without the overhead of AP, time and a lot of combat.

My only criticism is the art and components.  This game could use a face lift.  If they did a deluxe version of this game, count me in!

The 90-120 minute civ game is something of a holy grail for many in the hobby, and the Golden Ages might be the closet to achieving that ideal. Unlike peers Through the Ages and Nations, it features a board with geography and spatial elements. And while the tech choices in games like Clash of Cultures don't seem to result in differentiated civs, Golden Ages presents difficult and important choices in paths to take, leading to dramatically asymmetrical play. 

There are usability issues with some components (though others are excellent). And it seems difficult to claw back a player who has developed (through planning or simple good fortune) a winning combo. While that would be a serious defect in a longer game, the brevity of Golden Ages takes the sting out.

Despite almost completely different mechanics, the game it feels closest to is Nations. The artwork is even similar. While Nations is probably a deeper and more refined game, it comes at the cost of longer and less forgiving play. The looseness of Golden Ages is by no means a flaw.

Surprised that i hadn't noticed this civ building game before.  What a gem !  I really like how the exploration tiles are made up of the world map.
After one game, i could see this become one of my favourites and here's why.  
I tend not to prefer confrontational civ games where conflict becomes an over-riding strategy, turning any game into an arms race.  Yes, there is conflict in this and its early days to determine whether the balance is right.  But my first game impression with each civ only being able to attack 4 times, lets hope so.
On the slightly negative side, I thought the wonders would have done more but instead seemed more of a building type option rather than a grandiose statement of each civ's cultural influence.  Perhaps my lack of knowledge on various victory conditions at this time?

08-12-2014. Rated after 1 play. Good eurogame with Civilization theme. In this game you just try to be the best civilization. 

Each turn you place a piece of a map and play a leader card, you try to control resource tokens and buy upgrades. These upgrades give you special abilties, but also can provide you with VPs. You take worker placement actions, but there are also free actions available. The player who passes first gets to choose which special objective card is resolved to get more stuff/Vps etc.

Fun game. Quite neat. But no need to own. Also, the design of the game is attrocious, it's really, really ugly. But the game is excellent so I can forgive it because of that.

RATING: 8


Have played twice this week after reading about the expansion and I am loving it again. It started to feel a bit repetitive after 3 plays because there isn't much variety after 3+ sessions. All of the wonders always come out, regardless of player count. But as mentioned above, expansion will likely give it the kick in the ass that it needs. I really like the flow of the game, select a tile, place it and select from 8 possible actions. The tech tree is fantastic, and if done right, the combos start getting crazy. First player that passes (once all your meeples are used) selects a history judgement right away, then the reat of the players finish their actions. Everytime the player that started the Golden Age comes up, he/she takes 2 bucks.. So timing well could yield some nice results. Warfare is nicely handled, and each attack (if done right) could net some good perks, and it doesn't totally devastate the victim which is good. Each attack costs progressively more and more and sometimes money is tight. I have eliminated the 2's and 6 point chits of the attacks and only play with 3-5. That way the luck of the draw isn't so strong. 4pt swings could be potentially devastating but 2 could be mitigated. If you find a copy, buy it.. Especially now that the expansion is for real. 

Update: What a great game. I cannot wait for the expansion, although I am a little bummed about the price tag, seeing as the component quality looks underwhelming.

RATING: 7
A light civilisation games that comes in just at the right length for its weight. Player order, timing and carving your own niche is vital here as you do the normal civilisation things and improve your technology to give you more and better abilities. The balance of fiddliness is good as you use your precious few settlers to take territories, build cities and build buildings. The balance is good between passing to get extra money and choosing the History’s Judgment card, or staying in the round a little longer to do just a couple more things.

What I'm not that keen on is the conquest victory point range. It is possible for one player to get a significant advantage or disadvantage through blind luck and blind picking six point chits or two point chits. With a double digit point swing easily possible it can likely decide a game and that's a shame.

The same wonders and (depending on player numbers most or all of the same) buildings will come out each game, so players with a bit of experience can expect to trounce the newcomers as there's some big points preparing for buildings and wonders the experienced player knows are coming up.

Those portraits on the Wonder cards are so ridiculously small it's almost funny.

Simple rules. Quick playing. Lots of interesting decisions to make and path options to take. Overall it's a good game and one I'd be happy to explore again and again. I think four players is the preferred number to add a bit more competition to the mix.

Cool game, can't decide if it's a 7 or 8.  Played with the expansion.  

Lots going on, tons of decision points, which is great, although there was a good bit of AP when we played, turning it into a 3.5 hour game.  That may have been a function of playing with the expansion as well because it added at least a couple of layers to the decision making.    

The randomness of the leaders is kind of a double-edged sword because it can force you to pursue a strategy you didn't want to pursue- and that's fun- but you can also get sort of unlucky if you have more than one sub-par leader.  You can also hit a jackpot of leaders who compliment each other and/or your end-game objective.  But that randomness means a ton of replay-ability.  

The thing I liked least was the art and iconography.  The leader images on the wonders cards were bordering on unintelligible and some of the art was a bit dated.  But the game play was solid and I had fun, so I'd definitely play again given the chance.

It's on the lighter end of the civ game genre and it's pretty accessible.  Some of the iconography requires reference, but the actions are pretty evident.  There is direct conflict, but you can only attack up to four times in the game and it gets progressively more expensive with each attack.  One of the things I liked best is that all 4p can take different, viable routes and be competitive.  It's a good game and I'd play it again, though I tend to like my civ games a little meatier.

Update: correlated GBs average 8.2 on this. Need to check it out.

Update: played this 3p at a game night. The play felt rather unintuitive to get started; it seemed weird that "buying" a building just required expending a worker, but "building" a wonder just required spending gold. Things like that. We were rocking toward the end but it took over 2 hours to get there, I think. My comment at the time to my friend was, "I would have loved this 10 years ago but now I feel like it should be streamlined more." He liked it a lot and so I sold it to him on the spot.

In the days since then I've thought about it more and now feel I was overly harsh on it. I want to try it again.

Update: played it again 2p, going in with a better understanding of game flow, planning, etc. Definitely enjoyed it a lot more this time, bumped my rating up a notch.

Egyszerűnek tűnő civilizációs játék, de van azért min gondolkodni játék közben. Lapkalerakással kezdjük a körönket, majd különböző akciókat hajthatunk végre három emberünkkel. 4 sorban feljeszthetünk, városokat hozhatunk létre, amikkel az adott térképrészen termelve pénzhez jutunk. A pénzből csodákat építhetünk, amik különböző módon hoznak győzelmi pontokat. A játékban a harc nagyon szerencsefüggő, ugyanis a pénzért végezhető támadások után 2-6 győzelmi pont közötti véletlenszerű bónuszlapokat kapunk. Érdekes megoldás, hogy az először passzoló dönt a kör végi pontozást meghatározó lapról. A játékot nem éreztük eléggé kidolgozottnak, újdonság se sok van benne, kimondottan csúnya szerintem a dizájn és rengeteg a szerencse. Ettől függetlenül változatos, többutas, játszható játék.

First impressions: This is a lovely little EuroCiv game. You build your own world and populate with littler cubes, er, cities. You find new technologies and construct great wonders. You can fight a little but not so much that any player can be knocked out. Time will tell how much we continue to like this game and how much replayability there is, but so far I'm quite happy with it. (I've read some other comments on the art and been amazed that some folks don't like it. I LOVE the Alexandre Roche art, it makes me almost want to buy Troyes, even though that game doesn't sound like my cup of tea. The cards have a slightly fairy tale dream feel to them that I find completely charming.)

This game does a good job of packing a civ game into a couple hours.  While the components are not impressive, the gameplay is fun.  Players must make lots of interesting choices. Amidst all the civilization games, this one may not be golden, but it is certainly silver.

1 play, 2er

A quick-playing civ-themed euro. In my book, it's too quick to really feel like a civ game. It has the key elements (tech tree -- though very simplified, area/resource control -- though you can't hurt each other TOO much, Wonders, Buildings) but they are just so ... bland! 

With just two players, both learning the game, there are a few caveats:
- we only saw part of the map and a subset of the buildings and leaders in the game
- neither of us looked ahead at our 4 leaders, nor the wonders that would be coming; so there was very little planning
So I'd like to try the game again, probably with 4 players, and with more attention to having some kind of long-range plan (based on the leaders I'm dealt, and what I hope to acquire from Era to Era).

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There are 4 Eras, each with 5 steps:
1. Reveal all Wonders for this Era, and n buildings. In turn order, players reveal their leader and decided to keep the previous one, or the new one. Player with lowest numbered leader is Start Player.
2. Add to the map (1 tile/player). May move your capital, along with any Colonists with it (3 at start of game), to the newly placed tile.
3. From Start Player clockwise, take one action. 
- Actions allow you to move Colonist and/or build (place cube on tile), move and/or attack (then may build), earn 3 VP, build building, build wonder, advance a tech, activate a building or wonder, or pass.
- Some actions require you to have active Colonist (they lie down after taking an action), some do not; some require money.
- When you do various things, you may earn VP or coins based on your tech or the card you're activating.
- The first person to pass chooses one of the 5 face up scoring cards (to score at end of Era, then remove from game). If turn comes back to someone who has Passed, they earn 2 coins. Era ends when last player passes: score the scoring card, then reset tokens. The 4th era, though, ends after one player passes and every other player has taken just one more turn; then the game ends.

At the end of the game, score additional VP:
- 1VP per 3 coins
- 8VP for meeting condition on end game bonus card you were dealt at start
- VP for Glory chits (earned when attacking)
Most VP wins.

RATING: 7
This is a very light civilization-style game with a couple really interesting mechanics and a lot of decisions to make giving it depth.

The game is played across 4 rounds.  During each round players will take turns taking one action.  Many of the actions require the use of a meeple, of which each player only has 3 and the ones that don't are limited by your resources.  The reason this game has so much depth is because the order of actions you take can matter quite a bit, right down to taking the action that ends the round.  If you are the first one to do this you get to choose the scoring criteria for that round.  This could be both beneficial if you choose one you are sure to score better than other players but also not beneficial if choosing this before other players are done they are able to score better with that criteria with their remaining turns.

It is almost like a game of chicken and those kind of decision crossroads exist in many parts of the game.  Another example would be the civilization cards.  These have special abilities as well as numbers on them with the numbers being lower on the earlier age cards.  The lower the number the earlier in turn order you go which can be powerful to certain strategies.  However typically later age cards are more powerful.  At the beginning of each round you need to choose to keep the previous age civilization card or replace it with a newer one.

One of the neatest mechanics is the dynamic map construction.  At the beginning of each round players on their turns will draw a map tile and add it to the board building the game world following a couple basic criteria (which really just consists of matching land to land and sea to sea).  Each tile also has resources on it which can play into certain strategies as well as gives that player the opportunity to move their capital and any of their meeples in that capital.

The amount of content in this game isn't too spectacular.  This makes the game lighter than most civilization-style games but this also makes it more accessible and quick.  90 minutes is about the play time on this and a 2-player game can finish in under an hour.  Although with most games like this I don't recommend the 2-player over a game with more players.  The decisions are just more interesting when you have more than one other player to track.

As for the looks, this is nothing spectacular.  There is a certain art style to it which is fine and the pieces are all solid but it isn't an art style I care for and it makes it look old or cheap or both.  Also the civilization icons denoting a discount for the wonders is incredibly tiny and hard to read.

I think this does fit a perfect niche and that's the civilization game you play when you are looking for this kind of experience but only want to play a game for 2 hours or less.  It is also a good introduction into this style of game.

Really enjoyed my 1st play of this light civ style game. It has most of the elements of the genre, tech tree, wonders, buildings, civ powers and a modular map. All parts pared down. Best part for me were the decisions around timing end of eras. Liked it lots, suspect it will come down in play time, maybe too much randomness for some.

The game does a great job in abstracting a civ game in short playing time. Actions and turns are simple and fast with lot of fighting over buildings, wonders and resources.

Unfortunately, I didn't get the civ feel playing the game. Tech tree is limited. Buildings and wonders are always the same each game so I don't see the game as renewing itself after each play (board play seems to have little influence too).

My biggest problem with the game is the only thing differentiating your civ from the other players is the leaders who's effect is really scripting your game for you. Even if the game claims many path to victory (not convince here), you can't deviate from the path set by the leaders and be expected to win.

Everything in this game feels linear which is not what I would expect from a civilization game where I should be able specialize if I want and really do different action from my opponents every turn. Still a good game that I would very like to try again to see if my first impression is valid.

WTP 1/4 [CIV] 2-4 players; 90 minutes; A full-fledged yet Eurofied civ game with a tile-based map that is very streamlined, relatively simple, and plays quickly for this type of game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Streamlined, abstract civilization game, eurofied to the point that an "attack" requires just paying some money and replacing the enemy's city. And only four attacks can be made by each player over the whole game. (This, like most of the game's constraints, seem bizarre and artificial.)

Actions involve moving workers around the map and founding cities, building workers/wonders, or advancing along various technology tracks.

Player interaction is, unfortunately, lower than hoped after reading the rulebook. Perhaps the best reason to play is the interesting twist that that the first player to pass each round chooses one of the 5 scoring cards available in the game to use that round (only 4 will be used), so earning additional actions can prove counterproductive. This is probably necessary to offset the compounding advantages conferred by certain buildings and wonders, which could otherwise offer a large turn order advantage.

There are definitely multiple strategies on offer, but I don't like how certain civilization cards (which I am not sure are balanced) effectively railroad players into certain paths.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like some of the ideas in this one.  I like the concept of a quicker playing Civ game, and I like the way that battles work.  Unfortunately, the rest of the mechanics are pretty boring and mediocre.  Turn order is massively important, but other than first player, it is random.  The area control scoring isn't particularly interesting, and the tech tree is overblown and boring at the same time (Tech level 1 =1 coin, tech level 3 = 3 coins.  Wow!)  And the wonders ended up being ho-hum as well.  They are surprisingly easy to build, but they have an appropriate power level for that cost.  They aren't particularly balanced, and the buildings are even worse, but I guess that is supposed to be okay because it is an open draft.  I'm not a fan of balancing things that way.

The variability in the war scoring feels odd given that you can't do anything about it like you can in Eclipse.  The rulebook isn't written very clearly.  The components are dull.  The game works okay, and I found it okay to play once, but I just don't see much here to grab you.  For a light Civ game, Olympos is a much better choice.

tl;dr: solid euro, but not a real civ game

This was announced as being a relatively short civ game, but that's just the theme. It's mostly an engine building game with a map element. You do also have sort of a tech tree, but it doesn't feel like a real civ game. But that's not a knock on the game, it's actually really solid and enjoyable. And well developed. There are a few confusing icons, but that's a production issue, not a game design issue.
I actually played with the designer in Essen. We played [thing=156061][/thing], also announced as a short civ style game. Neither of us liked that game very much. Only after we finished playing did he tell me about his game. His reaction to Imperialism increased my hopes for this game, and it didn't disappoint.

Firstly, a complaint: the images of the leaders on each of the wonders is too damn small. I suspected, playing it, that the wonder cards had originally been 'full sized' cards and were reduced in size for the print run. Looking back at the prototype that isn't the case. Why not just add a matching icon to each leader and wonder then and make it easily identifiable?! I defy anyone to correctly identify a matching wonder across a table, especially if they aren't told which nationality their leader is.

Beyond that, I enjoyed The Golden Ages. Quined Games seem to be quickly developing a reputation for identifying interesting, quick(ish) games and brining that to market.

An enjoyable civ-romp in 90 minutes.

Includes the upgraded larger cards. Thanks Stronghold Games!

RATING: 6
This game distills elements of the civ-building genre down to a playable core you can finish in 90 minutes. Yet to do so, it has to make cuts. Where The Golden Ages cuts is from the positional game on the map. Here it feels more arbitrary. Attacks are annoying, but not devastating, and hardly permanent. Movement and territory is important, but only at key moments when you hope to maximize your gains for a specific scoring card. In subsequent rounds, you can move your resources around and set up for another card. This makes for a good game, but one that feels disconnected from its theme of building up civilizations.

What you get instead is a Euro-inspired experience that puts a lot of effort into tech-tree combos and point-optimization strategies. Again, not a bad thing, but also a bit tired after a few plays.

I've heard the expansion helps, but I'm not so inclined to try. I'm just not that big of fan of the genre -- and I'd rather play something like Antike, which delivers a civ-lite (sort of) game in the Euro tradition with a focus on action selection instead of tech tree build-up. If your priorities are the reverse of mine, however, I'd recommend you give The Golden Ages a try. It's solid and worthwhile, but ultimately not for me.

The tech tree and exploration mechanics are pretty mediocre, but it has a nice flow to the game with the action system and economy.

The game seems solid based on my learning game, but with a couple of cautious concerns. For winning a battle you get a random tile that could be from 2-6 points. That's way too much of a range for a game like this, and that is the same thing that killed Eclipse for me. I almost never use houserules, but I've seen people online recommend removing the 2's and 6's and I think I'll play that way in the future.

Another thing I've seen brought up is the randomness of the cards and map tiles. If someone gets really good synergy from their cards then they could get a big advantage. I'll have to see how this plays out in practice though.

Overall it seems like a good design. Will rate after more plays.

For a very long time, I searched for a civ-style game that was playable in 90 minutes, primarily Euro driven (still with some dose of attacking though), with a map, and a tech tree. This game is exactly that. Many other games tried to do it, but all others failed. his one is the only one that has nailed it on the head. To top it all off, the game art was done by my favorite game artist. 

With a few more plays, I can imagine this game will be pushing its way up my favorites list. There's a good possibility it may break into my Top 10.

I want a full-blown civ builder and I don't want to spend a day to play it, so that's why I got this one. After several plays I think this game delivers. Really streamlined rules and system and plays really fast, and still fun for me after several learning games with my wife. Multiplayer, especially with 4 or 5, it really gets tense, since there are much more situations where you need to go to war to gather control over important ressources. And even with 5 - and some of them new - it only took 3 nours, including setup, teardown and teaching.

RATING: 8
This is a craftily done euroized lite Civ game that contains a deceptively large amount of game within a small set of rules.  At first glance, you will feel extremely constrained due to a lack of everything.  This is not a game that just hands you everything, you actually have to be creative and maximize the effectiveness of your actions, you need to plan ahead and set yourself up for big moves. 

The game also manages to implement a very interesting timing mechanism.  You basically need to maximize the quality of your actions, not the quantity of them.  In the first three rounds of the game, when your opponents pass, they will automatically get money every time their turns comes back around.  So if you built a bulky engine with lots of "extra action" plays, you are going to make your enemies very rich.  And in the final round of the game when one person passes, you only get 1 more action, this element of push your luck is really interesting.

"War" is implemented in one of the most streamlined and non-confrontational ways I have ever seen here and it really works within the Euro nature of the game.  When you attack someone you have to pay an increasingly large fee to do so.  You simply remove their pieces from the space (which ranges from annoying to a totally unconcerning, but is almost never devastating) and you get some VPs for the show of strength.  Simple, elegant and it works.

Finally, you are presented with a streamlined but still deceptively tricky tech tree that has tie-ins to virtually everything else you can do in the game.

My only complaints have to do with the odd decision to not put names on cards, and the insanely tiny icons on Wonder cards that indicate a discount for certain leaders.  I understand that the wonders had originally been printed in mini euro format and were scaled up in different printings but man is that stuff tiny.

Outside of those little aesthetic details, this game has really managed to do lite civ well and I am shocked that it hasn't received more praise for pulling it off.

The Golden Ages is a superquick civ building game. Forget what you knew about civ building and how it was supposed to take hours. This gives you a scaled down version of that epic experience. You lose some of the epicness, but it more than makes up for it in time savings.

The game is a little incomprehensible at first glance. There are 16 tiles on your personal player board, all of which have icons that you have to learn before the game makes much sense.

The game is played in four ages. In each age you elect a new leader (or not), place a tile on the board, move your capital to the new tile (or not) and then take actions with your three guys and do some other non-meeple actions.

The heart of the game is the tiles on your personal player board which are technologies that give you special abilities and/or give you points. There are also some wonders and buildings that can be bought. The map exists so that you can perform a somewhat abstracted version of building a civilization. You move your guys around the board trying to move onto certain symbols and put cubes on the board. There are three main reasons for doing this. First, you get money for it, how much depends on what technologies you've unlocked. Second, there are wonders and end game goals that tie into which resources you control. And third, it allows for a combat system where you can move into another player's space and initiate a combat.

You only get to have four combats per game and you have to fund them by paying an ever increasing cost to initiate combat. You automatically win and get to draw a victory point token from the bag... mostly worth three, four or five points, although there are a couple of twos and sixes.

When you've finished moving all your meeples, you have the option to pass. Passing is good because you get to choose which of the remaining five victory cards will score for this round... presumably one that you are doing well in. Additionally, every time the turn gets back to you, you get 2 bucks. And money is largely what drives point scoring in the game.

The game feels like a very abstract version of a civ building game. That abstraction allows for the game to be dramatically shorter than a lot of civ games, but it also is going to disappoint many people who crave the standard civ game.

I enjoyed the game a lot. It was much quicker than I anticipated. And I think that I'd have a better idea how to play the second time around. Several rules came up at odd times in our initial play. For example, just before we went into the last age we found out that in the last age the games ends when the first person passes and other players only get one additional action. And it was only during the last age that it was mentioned you can't pass until you've played all your meeples. But slight rules surprises aside, it was a very satisfying game. I'm already looking forward to playing again.

"Great wars were faught with nary a drop of blood spilled...", this phrase perhaps best describe The Golden Ages, a civ-lite game stripped down and abstracted to span four different eras. It is also decidedly a Euro game with Euro-inspired engine-building, resource harvesting and set collecting with the aim of amassing loads of victory points, or influence points in this case. 

Minimalist to its core,  The Golden Ages spots a unique "innovation" in resolving conflict resolution, or rather a lack thereof. One hallmark of civilization building is the bloody conquest of your neighboring whelps which is mostly missing in The Golden Ages. Players are allowed to attack only four times in the entire game with escalating costs for each conflict. The reward: glory tokens with random values. The designer specifically mentions that the game was designed to de-emphasize military conquests. To further prove his point, the designer allows foreign units to peacefully share resources with neighboring kingdoms and nation capital cities gladly allow neighbors to park their settlers across the river to mine for gold. Yes, conflict is not necessary when every body can happily hunt for food or extract ore from the same tile. Hurrah. This is the crux of a Euro-inspired civ-light design.

If one can accept this global kumbaya in civilization building, there is a decent game hidden beneath The Golden Ages. The rules are meant to develop a game with minimal conflict and maximum resource engine-development. Players take turns crafting their engines without having to interact with each other much. Occasionally, one has to decide when to grab a free building or build a wonder lest they get jumped on by other players. Money, the only resource does not appear to be that tight and points can be had in multiple ways. 

Overall, the game may score well with civ fans but falls short in many other ways. The game lacks a certain amount of tension as the board is rarely contested. Conquest of countries is too abstracted and could have been redesigned to amp up player interactions. There is potential in this game, but it still feels a bit rough on the edges.

I'm not sure I've ever had quite the reversal of feeling on a game as with this one. My first play saw me getting the tar beaten out of me (partly due to some biffed rules) and I wrote it off. But after giving it a second chance I found it to be a very svelte and compact design that still had enough bells and whistles to be called a Civ game.

If I had one complaint it's that I'm not a huge fan of the end game scoring cards (which seem largely dependent on the actions of the other players), but this is streamlining at it's finest.

(Only played with Cults & Culture expansion)

Possibly a decent game in there after several plays (and possibly better and much faster without the expansion) but marred by poor graphic design/production - starting with the butt ugly box cover (surely nobody who just sees this game on the shelves in a shop would ever consider buying it?); continuing with fiddly setup; neverending rulebook lookups for just about every single tile's and card's non-obvious icons (FFS at least include reference sheet player aids for these, and FFS include combined reference sheets / player aids for base game + expansion); and the tiny cost icons on the wonder cards are just moronic as are the scoring markers which do not fit on the scoring track.

Randomly dealt leader cards significantly dictate/limit your options and some (fx Vikings - keep going reusing your workers; extremely useful combined with some other cards) seems much better than others (fx Queen Victoria get 5 gold discount / 6 gold cash once).

Very cool tiles design with cut up, rearrangeable, real world map parts.

Played without expansion in 1.5 hour with 4 players this would probably be good but 4 hours with expansion is simply not worth it. A 3 player game of Through The Ages would be a much better use of that time.

I feel like I've seen the mechanics in this game a lot. An economic game with a tech tree. The exploration tiles and the main board are a nice touch, though the flip luck can be a little frustrating, but only at the beginning of the game. Basically, the strategy in this game is build a money engine early and then win the game. I would play this again to win but probably not much more after that, unless the expansion adds new things to the game.

A boring, unimaginative attempt at 2hr civ. Money is basically the only currency, so mostly your turns consist of scrounging together enough cash with your actions to buy tech upgrades, which increase your ability to get money and at the higher levels score VP for simple stuff, e.g. 1 VP for every city you have on the board. The entire game consists of setting yourself up for these simplistic scoring opportunities, which appear as tech or otherwise as cards you just draft from a face up pool. If this all sounds terribly familiar and uninspiring it's because it is- Golden Ages has no clever mechanic or redeeming quality to really set it apart.

This is a neat game. I like the tech development, and the variety of people, building, and victory points, for each age.

Gold initial impression, a fun civ light that plays very fast. Icons can be a bit confusing at first but things become clear fast. Recommended.

Very good game about developing a civilization.
Best characteristics are the limited time, the simple rules, the different paths to victory.
Amazing idea (genius!) is the modular map with pieces of the real World Map: you could play the original normal map or you can create a new one every time but with familiar pieces.

The only true complaint is the art: the style is quite shabby, understanding which Wonder pertains to which civilization is a nightmare and... all in all it seems realized by a beginner.

Anyways, if you look for a short intense civ game, go for it

What a game! A 2 hour (for 4 players) streamlined Euro Civ game that has it all - tech trees, map expansion, cities, buildings, wonders, unique civs.

4X Euro civ. Basic and simple appearance of cards and board but it is effective for game play and the symbology is quick to learn and easy to read. Choose a leader that also determines turn order, play tetrus shaped continent tiles that match existing land and sea faces, migrate workers or move capital city, produce resources, research and leverage technology, build and activate buildings, build and exploit wonders, place city cubes for area control, barter, and manage gold as you cycle through the four sets or era cards. I like the war mechanic for area control where it can be chosen a select number of times at escalating cost. Placing workers into the agora is a unique mechanic which introduces a time out before they can return to the capital city. The game encourages different play and strategy to optimize with which cards come out and your history judgements (personal objectives). And of course the name sake of the game, declare a Golden Age to earn an era bonus and start the next--I love this mehanic where other players pay to continue actions in the current age. This game offers a medium weight civ that can play in less than 2 hours. I would play this with the cultures and cults expansion.

Decent civ-game. To get good scores you have to get good combos, but it felt like it was lacking depth in the amount of combos available. The game also felt like it was restricting me as a player a bit too much for me to like it a lot as a civ-game. The game exploded a bit too much in the end for my taste too. Will not reject another play but I will not buy the game or propose a play.

Such a great mid weight euro!  If only I could combine the great aspects of this game, with the great aspects of Nations...we'd probably have a perfect game!  I love the board building.  I love how rounds can last as long as the players want them to and that you can take more actions in a round if you are willing to give money to the players who have already passed.  I appreciate the incentives the game gives for a player who passes early.  Getting to choose the scoring card for that round is really nice when you pass early.  There is a bit of randomness in the cards that you get handed to you at the beginning of the game, but at least the game does allow you to plan out the path that works well with your cards from the beginning.  The technologies are fairly simple, but allow you to pursue some different strategic paths.  I like the game a lot and can't wait for the expansion!  Also, great artwork from Alexandre Roche!

6 after 1 play

Low player interaction, with the premise of war one of the few direct ways of interacting with other players, and founding of cities an indirect way of interaction. The war mechanic is simply a pull back the current leader mechanism, which felt somewhat lame, especially the unknown VPs bit. The 2 dollars collection for every turn you passed and other players have not is a catch-up mechanism seems strange and unthematic. Most importantly, the game lacks a strong story arc due to little buildup in strength of the leaders and buildings, so that each era does not feel that much different from the previous. 

Artwork is bland. Game components quality is ok. Iconology is bad, requiring every player to make frequent reference to the single help sheet in the rules.

Area-control Civ game, plays in around 90-120 mins; can be a fast paced game. Place tiles, move workers or place cities (cubes) to create area control which gives you resources; in addition all players have secret objective to claim most of a certain resource. Players can advance on I think 4 tracks but can be costy; advancing can also give you victory points.   I thought it was a good game, reasonably fast paced civ game. I did not like the end game condition which is anybody could call it "a golden age" which causes end of round, so in last age if you're winning you can call it and you'll end the game and probably win.

Would play again.

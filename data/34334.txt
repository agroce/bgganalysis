RATING: 8
Part of the "Napolenoic 20"-Series - check for the updated edition!! It's much more interesting and fun to play!

I was part of the playtesting team of the Second Edition AND played it on Mark Beininger's Vassal module, too.

RATING: 8
This game "Waterloo 20" started the Napoelonic 20 series. The idea was to create a tense and interesting battle situation and still keep a kind of simplicity without getting simple! Using less than 20 counters was the name of the game! 
It went into a great time, deriving sibblings from the Napoleonic times...

Played it much on Mark Beninger's very nice Vassal module.

First Impression: This is a light complexity game which flows well and is easily playable in about an hour. The game has an OSG-lite feel to it but is definitely all about the tactics and maneuvers, without concerning itself with logistics. The cavalry Reaction phase is simply brilliant. This would be a great gateway wargame to get someone interested in Napoleonics.

I think the criticisms regarding the ZOC rules being wrong for this scale and the CRT being too unforgiving are valid, but for me are outweighed by the fun factor.  The game plays very quickly and solos well. Components adequate for a zip-lock game.  It provides a decent historical flavor, and I've enjoyed repeated plays.  Not for beginners though, as the ZOC, retreat and cavalry rules are fairly nuanced (and should be better indexed). I would rate it low-intermediate.

This is a good entry in a good, simple system. Overall this lacks real historicity or gameplay. But, on the other hand, what did you expect in such a small package? I think the Nappy 20 series delivers as promised. Not a bad system to hook someone into wargaming. A bit overpriced.

Amazing low-density game: it keeps the elegence and look of an old SPI classic, but is in fact much much easier and more fun. Tons of decisions packed into this one.

The primacy of the morale track is the best feature of this game; so many things hinge on your army's morale. You can spend these at critical moments, but squander at your own peril! Also the CRT is based on sum, not ratio, which is a huge bonus and seems to work really well! Kudos to Miranda and Emerich for continuing to think outside the box and make a deep hex-and-counter game with a sparse rules set!

I like the cards, combat system, and morale track. However, I don't think Waterloo works as well because the map is just too narrow. It would have been better with more wiggle room. Still, this is a good system and not a bad game either.

Also, this has too many rules to be an effective introductory wargame, but it is a good step for players used to lighter fare and wanting something more.

RATING: 4
The morale management mechanic is the "hook".  The rest of the chassis is tried and true wargame mechanics recycled from Napoleon at Waterloo.  The situation isn't as open as one might hope - the way the map is laid out makes for a fairly linear and closeted feel to the action.

After three plays, the game feels like it is weighted too much in favor of the Allies for my tastes.

RATING: 3
A modern-looking upgrade of Napoleon at War, but not worth coming back to.  The army morale system is clever, but the overall dynamics completely fail to capture the feeling of the campaign, the locking ZOCs at this scale make no sense, and the game will likely get stuck in AH-classic style every-second-hex defense lines long before it reaches the namesake town.  Instead of battles followed by pursuit followed by decisive battles, you're more likely to get a bogged-down pushing match, a near constant drizzle of action, exciting but even at the game's very high abstraction level the way things run is just wrong.

The map is graphically very well executed but looks as if it was designed with a fisheye lens centered on Waterloo, not even the battle but only the space covered by Wellington's army. La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont on the map (in a corps scale game??), but not Plancenoit...  this is bizarre.  I used to be a fan of Miranda's ptolemaic Ancient Wars maps where one could argue that play, which was usually road-bound, was not affected by the liberties taken with geography but here that excuse doesn't work.

Overall, this game is not history, not abstraction, but caricature.  Yes, it only takes an hour but that hour doesn't resemble the dynamics of the Waterloo campaign, so why bother.  Thirty years after Napoleon at War, is this still the best the hobby can offer?  Depressing.

There are a million games covering the famous battle of Waterloo, and even quite a few simple ones (and many more complex ones). This really delivers a lot of gameplay, an interesting scale that shows the maneuvering, and historical tidbits that come out through the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Not my cup of tea. The sticky ZOCs don't make a lot of sense at the scale of the game. The mechanics in general don't really capture the nature of the Waterloo campaign - it becomes a corps on corps attrition match rather than the dynamic battle-and-pursuit that Napoleonic campaigns were known for. There are some neat morale rules but overall its just a generic oldschool wargame - I could forgive this if it at least evoked something about Napoleonic battle but it doesn't.

RATING: 7
Played once and loved the random storytelling events triggered by cards. The way moral decides the battle makes for grat endings to battles... The amount of dramatic push your luck mechanics at the end of a battle is mind-blowing.
Always close and always interesting choices... The ultimate mix of gambling and war-game.

RATING: 6
Small footprint, fast playing. Beyond that I'm not sure I see the attraction. The system is basically Napoleon at War with a morale track for a backbone and fleshed out with some random event cards and optional fog of war.

Some nits. Like so many Nappy games, it encourages the use of forests as strongpoints. And I'm not sure why a corps of infantry has to come out of a perfectly good town to attack cavalry skulking about.

Make sure you understand the implications of the locking ZOCs and mandatory attack rules, otherwise your positions can become a deathtrap.

What to do at Ligny is kind of an interesting little tactical puzzle for the French.

Great game in the wonderful 'Napoleonic 20' series. This game simulates the 3 days from Quatre Bras to Waterloo ans sees the French trying to push forward whilst maintaining their morale whilst the Allies pull back to a defensive position based on Wavre, Hougomont, La Haye Sainte.

Fantastic system, designed for playing with 20 counters (this is why the title is Waterloo 20). Well, do not expect the perfect simmulation about Waterloo campaign, it is absurd thinking it is possible with just 20 counters. You have to change your mind and abstract about this system. If you do and think only on gaming terms, 20 series is a top hit. Easy to learn and fast to play, get ready for a lot of enjoyment. Interesting tactic situations, exciting actions. No more than 1 hour per game, ideally for traveling because of the game size. Components are in the middle range between DTP games and boxed editions. Low cost, high performance. Best for novices. System quite similar to "Napoleon Last Battles", maps quite similar to "Waterloo, The Fate of France". Vassal Module available. A must have.

This is a nice little game.  Although it is very low in complexity it brings in many aspects of a Napoleonic campaign with simple to apply mechanics.  Morale changes based on breaking of enemy formations, cavalry counter-charges, commitment of Imperial Guard, throwing reserves into the battle, routs, withdrawal under fire, rallying of broken troops, etc., are all included with very simple rule applications. There are a surpisingly great number of decisions to make for a game of such small scope and limited number of counters.  These decisions can be quite tough to make as the morale level of your army is at stake.  As far as "hex & counter" wargames go Waterloo 20 is most certainly on the introductory level, but provides a surprising amount of depth for such a simple game. Excellent graphics with very colorful counters and map.

Joe strikes again.  As simple as [i]Napoleon's Last Battles[/i] and it's ilk, but with a different focus.  Setting at corps level means attention is drawn to army-level concerns, such as morale and gross maneuver.  Differential CRT means every strength point counts.  The variability of the random events and rout and rally rolls keeps the game fresh.  More a pastiche than a model of history, it still provides some limited insight with a good amount of tension.  The fog of war rules, while simple, provide the occasional gut check.  All in all, a good package for your money.

RATING: 8
A great little system which takes a semi-operational look at Napoleonic battles. Victory is tied to demoralizing the enemy army, and the catch is that each side must burn up (reduce its own) morale points in order to gain advantages in movement and combat. This makes for a fluid and interactive game with each player betting that his own use of morale points will lead to an equal or greater loss by the enemy.



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A surprisingly meaty and simple - but not simplistic - system that holds your interest via a variety of quality decision-trees, the friction of war, and fast gameplay. 

The Army Morale track is the key, and it very nicely represents various game functions (committing the Guard, pouring reserves into battle, force marching your troops, etc.). Indeed, it's quite disconcerting as a commander to see your Army Morale sag as the troops march, fight and fatigue. You then start thinking towards recovery via a lull turn or at night. 

Has numerous intriguing nuances, some neat optional rules, and the fun just never stops. I really like the crisp and functional graphical presentation, as well.

Very well thought out, often clever at times, and almost seamlessly executed. Has spawned a whole series of games.

UPDATE: VPG keeps "updating" this title (now in its 4th edition) to lure customers into repeatedly buying the game, plus to capitalize on the 100th anniversary of the battle. Their marketing strategy is a major turn-off.

tentative rating after limited plays.  Plays quickly but the combat results can be very erratic due to the differences in a 1 and 6!  Random event cards can make big differences to the game.

RATING: 9
I thought Waterloo would be a French blowout given the sheer number of French counters, but the Allies have no problems delivering smackdowns of their own.  In our games (so far), it's the Allies who have the highest win percentage.

There aren't many die rolls (compared to block games, e.g.), which means that each one counts. There's a strong vibe that each roll can win/lose you the game, which is both cool and scary at the same time.

Finally, the cards are a critical part of the game's success, as they have unexpected effects that provide welcome doses of surprise and tension.  I really like the system, overall, and I'm glad that I purchased the game.

RATING: N/A
Very nice enjoyably quick & simple time filler. Limited replay value as there's only one scenario and few units on the map - but then some people will happily replay Waterloo all their life! Very enjoyable, just enough chrome to raise it to a level where it seems like a simulation, not just a game. Does suffer a bit from lack of facing rules, but those would complicate things.

RATING: 7
Decent, old-school wargame with a nice twist in how morale is used.

I'd give it a higher rating, but the one time I played it, France had control of both Waterloo and Wavre and still lost the game. Why? France drew Esprit de Corps and failed its morale die roll on the final night turn! It's stuff like this that destroys narrative. Fortunately, the journey to get to the endgame made up for it, so I'll definitely get this on the table again. One huge advantage it has is that it's compact, and easy for newbies to grasp.

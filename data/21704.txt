Interesting game.  Some betting and prediction elements of poker.  Playing for shrunken heads (as the points/scoring mechanism) is definitely a plus.  Heads include Bert, Ernie and Bart Simpson, among others.  I'm tempted to buy the game just for the shrunken heads alone, but the gameplay isn't deep enough to hold me.

A pretty enjoyable bidding game. The challenge is to interpret the condition of the card pairs correctly and then make a good bid. Then you have to hope that your opponents see it differently, which is of course the luck element of the game.

The manual of the Dutch version is not entirely clear. Whose fault that is - the designer 2F or commercialist PS Games - I don't know. But I do know that in spite of the general good games of 2F the manuals are too often too difficult to read.

Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street are also present in the shrunken heads collection!

A slightly disappointing game which would be a major dissapointment if it wasn't simple filler. Twelve blind-bid auctions with chaotically moving endpoints make it hard to plan to win.

I have to admit that I didn't get proper rules explanation before the one game I've played. Nevertheless I feel that Fiji is too random and there's too much luck involved.

Is this a game?  I feel like I'm playtesting someone's VERY roughly sketched-out concept for a game.  You can see how the ideas behind the mechanics might be interesting, but as it is, this is one semi-broken mess.  Like Power Grid, a game that plays you rather than the other way around?  Where are the choices?  Can a strategy even be formed when everything is random, and the majority of the limited (4) options are non-starters?  I honestly don't know - I feel like we're missing something or playing wrong, but it can't be.  I'm beginning to wonder what FF is smoking.  Award for most inconsistent designer?

Fiji really grew on me on the second playing. The first time through it just seemed like a wacky, totally random game. But the second and third times through I started seeing things. It's still wacky and random, but you can exert control in a few ways and there is interest to trying to figure out your opponent's bids an planning ahead for three rounds of auctions.

Not top-tier filler, and just a touch long for what it is, but it's very unique, it works, and there is enough there to put your head to for it to be engaging. I think 4 players is probably the sweet spot. 5 sees a lot of ties.

You can speed up the setup of the gem cards by rolling a d8 and a d4 twice to figure out the ranking of the gems, instead of fiddling with the cards (thanks to Roger B for that tip).

I'm not usually enamored with blind bidding games. This one is so convoluted, though, that I kind of enjoyed myself. Also, its fresh and plays quickly.

I found that some of the more complicated action cards bugged me. I don't like the idea of being able to change the goals late in the round. I like the idea of trying to get more of some gems and less of others....and the way the tie-breaker generates this great bluffing mechanic. 

I think with more plays I might start hating this game...but right now I'd be willing to play again. I love the components. There's nothing like the shrunken head of Bert or Spongebob.

I wouldn't purchase or trade for this game, but I'd be willing to play. I expect the rating would probably decline to a 5 with more playings.

My first acquaintance with Fiji was made during Spiel 2006, where I and my sweetheart gave it a try when we were both close to exhaustion. Understandably, this didn't go down too well. A few months later I played with someone else's copy and decided there and then that we should have a copy. Even though my partner grumbled initially, after a first proper game she conceded it was a fun game, and that owning it was not a bad idea.

First and foremost, Fiji is a blind bidding game, so if you don't like those, you can stop reading now. Blind bidding is a tricky beast to get right, because for it to work, the players must be able to successfully conduct I think that you think that I think-games. And Fiji does these quite well indeed. The number of gems players are able to bid is very small, and it is not entirely impossible to keep track of what other players have in terms of bidding power either. It is also not too difficult to work out the relation between the goal and bidding assignment cards. Put it all together and you end up with a quick title with good gameplay which allows for rather a lot of subtleties. I've heard many people complain that it is too random, but personally, I think you should read that as 'I suck at putting in the effort to try and play well'. I do very well at this title, and that cannot be all due to luck! Don't treat it as something beer-and-pretzel like, or you'll get burned.

There are a few ifs and buts, though. I dislike the rewards which mess with the goal cards. There aren't many of them, but still, the entire process of bidding gets jammed with a crowbar if those appear. I also dislike the the plastic gems: they are too small and roll away too easily. It fits in with the subject matter though; and they probably form the most expensive part of the game (visit a shop which sells beads to make your own necklaces if you don't believe me). Still, a size or two bigger would have been nice.

Not being a fan of blind bidding and outguessing, this is really a surprise hit. The thing what makes it interesting is that the choices are not limited to 5 or less (Edel, Stein & Reich ; Adel Verpflichtet) and that the result of the bidding is also not limited (4 results with only one bid). Besides the interesting mechanic, there's also lots of fun seeing how someone's plans fall into pieces one step at a time.

Played one with my son (6). Entertaining, easy to learn. Will play again. I'm not sure whether this is a very difficult game, most likely it's too easy (or too hard)with two as both players will play the same strategy which results in a lot of ties. Need to play again, preferably with >2 players before I can give a realistic verdict about this game.

RATING: 6
This is a blind-bidding game in which players try to out double-think each other. The replayability mechanism it uses is the pairing of random trigger conditions with random outcomes (i.e.- most reds gets a blue or least blues gets four reds). The same blind bid of colored gems is used for each of the four pairings and then then two more rounds are played with the same cards, but different bids. At the end of those three rounds, the player who has the most (or least, depending on the win condition card draw) of a particular color gem wins the most shrunken heads. The player at the end of 4 turns with the most shrunken heads wins. 

Bluffing games are not really my thing, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I felt like my decisions didn't always matter, sometimes because of the card pairings,  sometimes because of the lack of gems in the common pool, and sometimes because of tie-breakers getting bumped to the remaining player. The double-think was interesting at times and frustrating other times. I feel like it might get better with repeated plays, but I'm not all that compelled to play it again, which is a strange situation to be in. The shrunken heads of Bert and Ernie are just great. I wouldn't recommend the game to people, but I wouldn't slag it either, because it would probably be good for gamers like that this type of game.

Players make offerings of gems over rounds in order to obtain victory points (shrunken heads!).  The game is played over four rounds, each round the rules for the payouts are determined as a ranking system (most red gems beats fewest green gems beats... etc).  Each round sees in the fist blind bids of gems simultaneously revealed, and gems change hands based on offering/exchange cards.  At the end of each round, the heads are awarded based on what gems are held in hand.  It all sounds complex, but it really isn't, and the game hurtles along at a great pace.  Control freaks will hate it, those who enjoy blind bidding, thinking a bit about how this will play out, and groaning at the injustice of it all, will love it.  Not bad, and it's quick!

Blind bidding game where gems are bid from a fixed starting distribution and a closed loop.  The core idea that the same set of cards is bid upon three times is a decent concept.   But the scoring is wonky and the goals can change drastically at the last minute.  Somewhat fun, but nothing I'd be dying to play multiple times.

Played once with 5 players; I think the game would probably raise a point with fewer players -- 3 may be ideal.  There seems to be too many ties going on with 5, and while that's somewhat interesting, it often means that no players get the "goodie" offered up by the game for satisfying a particular game condition.  I do like what the game is attempting to do (one bid for multiple auctions), and It pulls it off.  I'd like to try again with less, but probably won't play it again with 5.

Bidding game based upon a randomly selected hierarchy of gem colours. Really nice idea accept a lot of effort was put into making this language independent and unfortunately this means it is quite confusing, for example one hand with 4 gems means have the least and two hands with a single gem means have to most...... since its a gem game the image with the most gems is the one where you need the least!

Traded in a math trade (2013) for Metro 2033.

I struggled to work out the best choices in Fiji. It's a group-think double bluff game, and I like them (Basari being one of my favourite examples, Zahltag another), but the 4 different offer cards conflicted, so it became very hard for me to figure out what other people might think, or think what I think, or er I dunno. I finished with just 2 heads, whilst the others romped away. Hmmmm, I don't think the game is at fault, will play again but it just didn't click for me.

But I don't think the game would work without the tiebreaker rules, because there would be a clear "right" answer in many cases.

There are some really wild and interesting mechanics in here, but ultimately the game didn't do much for me.  It's about as frustratingly random as a game can get.  In theory you can outthink and double-think and triple-think your opponents, but in practice I'm certain that you would have an equal chance of winning if you just bid randomly each hand.

I've played this quite a bit since I got it, with any number of players from 3 to 5. It's chaotic, and a bit random... with some brain-hurting decisions, and lots of second-guessing what your opponents are going to do. It's not usual that you can accurately analyse and predict what's going to happen, so I tend to go with my gut feeling, rather than spend too long on analysis.. This way the game remains fun, and I can usually still finish in the first 2... this may not be the case against other experienced fiji players however.

Filler game which really screws with your head, because often you want to win the *least* of a type of gem.  You have to work out the logic of the current cards, then figure out who is going to make the same calculations, and try not to tie those players (because ties cancel and go to another player).  Or maybe you *don't* want to win that auction, so you *want* to tie with other players so you won't have to win it.  Especially mind-bendin are the cards that allow you to swap the priority of two scoring cards, or reverse a scoring card from "biggest wins" to "smallest wins".

Initial BGG.con 2006 impression: Wow there seems to be a lot of ire directed at this game. Yes it's hard to control but that is the challenge of this game.

Plus the art (shrunken heads especially) is of the usual 2F-Spiele quality as of late and it's pretty fast. Would like to get this one.

It's like playing [gameid=2392] after having your eyes gouged out (painlessly yet comically) so you're wearing a raw bandana of white gauze around your face with two reddish-brown circles seeping through.  Your hand quivers as you present your offering of fake gems; you can smell the natives as they press in, eager to see who screws up.  [i]Hopefully[/i], they breathe in unison, [i]hopefully it will be that one with the big, fat head...[/i]

The kink, and what makes the game, is that ties cancel out—so that if several people would have won the bid (because they all bid optimally) they are removed from contention and the winner is sought from the remaining players.  This process of elimination continues until only one person remains.  This leads to a wonderful, awfully weird headspace where you are not trying to make *optimal* bids, but *unique* bids.

The result is a delicious game of quintuple-think where things very rarely ever go the way you want—if your idea of fun is trying to ride a giant electric chaos-whip, then grease up and hop on—this one's for you!

A pure blind bidding game where ties go to the second place player. I like the complex, changing conditions. There's more here than the lightness and the very silly theme would suggest--and there is certainly some strategy to knowing what your opponents will bid.  Tracking the beads is useful.  The fact that the winner can be determined before the game is over keeps this from being a 7 for me. (2 play)

You want a nice filler game at the end of an evening, especially if one too many beers have been consumed?

This might just be the one for you.

Players start out with identical sets of gems each round, which they offer to the Fiji natives who then award shrunken heads as payment depending on a set of awards cards.  The random mixture of high/low set collecting and the fact that all offers are hidden and revealed simultaneously, make for a game that everyone has a chance at winning.

If you can outguess what the other players are going to offer, you'll do well.  A great light weight game that you can play with kids and grandparents alike.

If you like Basari or Edel, Stein & Reich, this should definitely go on your shopping list.

Lots of fun... a solid 8.

[5+ plays] This is a game of strategic wild-ass guessing. You have to bid the right way on the right auctions, but you have to guess your opponents' bids since ties cancel. Knowing when to go all out and when to hold back is the trick. NOT for taking seriously, and not for haters of chaos.

Another weak title from Friedemann Friese. As with many of his games, the parts just don't come together. The basic concept of blind bidding gems based on various trade rules is innovative and requires a lot of brain work. But it breaks down with the tiebreaker rule. In case of ties between two players the third player takes it all. Too much thinking to a totally random effect! Specifically, some rounds (one round consists of three blind bids) are decided on the first bid by a single rule making the other bids pointless while other rounds are totally random because of incalculable last round changes of targets. Finally, there's some rough edges as rules not coming to effect because of lack of gems. While this might be considered part of the game mechanism it just feels improvised to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I've had this game in the back of my mind for years.  I like Friedemann Friese and his unusual themes.  I like blind bidding games as well.  But the middling comments for some reason made me hesitant about pulling the trigger.

There's definitely the core of a great idea in this game.  I like the little puzzle of figuring out what to bid, and the second guessing about what your opponents might do.  I imagine it would probably be too chaotic with 5, but having played with 3, you could make some reasonable assumptions about your opponents' bids.

Still, the repetitiveness of the auctions (and I love auctions) is problematic, because there are certain combinations of cards that can invalidate the first two rounds of bidding.  So why would it even matter?  Also, the way that gems are limited, if there are no gem changing cards, once certain gems run out there is no reason to play out the rest of the round except to figure out second place.

So, if I was more presumptuous I would call the game "underdeveloped", but let's just say that I hope that a better game comes out with the same sort of idea.

Not really one play.  We sat down with this two player.  The box says 2-5 players but I think the "2" is not accurate.  I suppose it could be fun or entertaining with three or maybe four players but it just didn't excite me.  I want to like this based on the theme but although the shrunken head illustrations are humorous the components (kind of cheap especially the gems) can't even excite me and push me into wanting to own this.

Very strange and rather chaotic, but interesting and clever auction game. Original look and feel - an excellent filler! You'll make twelve bids in total and that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. To make things "worse", each player will reveal his bid at the same moment. So, you could call this a blind bidding game. But, it is not completely "blind". There is actually a lot of information available. Each player starts each of the four rounds with the same distribution of the four different types of pearls. You have to bid at least one and at the most four pearls in three turns during each round. There are four cards that offer rewards in each round and each requires either the most or the least of a combination of pearls. In addition, some of these rewards you really want and others you really really want to avoid, because in each round there is a different target for each of the four types of pearls: either the most or the least. Your bid will be taken in account for all four the cards on offer. And this is the nicest part of the whole thing: ties cancel eachother out. In short: this is a cruel game of logical thinking, outguessing and doubleguessing. I like it! By the way, the score is tracked with shrunken heads: Bert & Ernie, Bart Simpson, Elvis and the designer himself are in there ...

Blind bidding is not a favorite mechanism of mine although this is mostly about the metagame and trying to figure out what other people are going to throw out there.  The "tie" rule throws a wrench into everything, but without the tie rule in effect, this game would be a dry, boring exercise that should result in everyone tying for the victory if they correctly figured out the "puzzle".  In this game, not only do you have to figure out the puzzle, you have to figure out what other people may vary in bidding to attain the goal.

I think I've won this game almost every time I've played it and I still don't know why.  I usually take a short look at the puzzle, briefly consider what other might do, and then make a quick gamble...so far, so good...:-)

Not being a fan of blind-bidding at all, I actually enjoyed this game quite a bit. Light, fast, and doesn't overstay its welcome. I find that it's lacking a bit of a "story arc" due to resetting the players' stockpile every round; and would've enjoyed seeing a 5th colour and card make an appearance, but those are minor quibbles.

I believe there was another game I once donned the ultimate in blind-bidding but it's now been knocked off it's throne by Fiji.  A very chaotic game that somehow works for me.  Maybe because it's quick and so ridiculous.  Also, helps that it has a fun, although loosely fitting theme.

Why is there no tie-breaker???  The entire game revolves around breaking ties each round, yet there is no tie-breaker at the end of the game.  And since each round you earn 1,2,3 or 4 points (with 4 players) there is a very good chance there will be a tie.  The last game I played with 4 players I was the only player to lose!  The other three players tied for the win.

A barking mad game, frankly. Fiji is a real love-it or hate-it creation - pure psychology at its heart, with an amazing card-generated pseudo-randomness and head-hurty strategy. The beads are a fiddle, though, and some of the action card combinations are a pain to even attempt to work with. Not deserving of an 'unworkable' label by any means: there's a strategy available here for those prepared to analyse.

RATING: 6
It felt like it was taking Sackson's Bazaar (convert this gem into these and convert those into that to score this) and generating a family game out of the concept. Or at least a game that didn't feel like dry-as-dust algebra as Bazaar did. And in that it succeeded at least. In the fist simultaneous bidding as a core mechanism is hard to sell and enjoy, and usually only works satisfactorily in 10 minute affairs like Raj. Despite that, I did surprisingly enjoy this as a once-off (or at least very occasional) affair. I've only played with 5, which enabled lots of ties, which created a fun cheer/groan factor and surprise results as players knocked themselves out of the running for various gem conversions. But also felt pretty random obviously. Which is probably the only way it can generate any "fun" given all players start with the same gems and the same conversion equations. As such, it's not going to be requested as something worth exploring. But it wasn't sunk-in-the-desert bad either.

The game revolves around using the tie break rule to your advantage, leading to such counterintuitive plays as bidding the least optimal bid to win. I don't know if that really is a good thing to base a game around. I may give it another shot, but it's way down on my list.

A blind bidding game.  Anyone can play, because all you have to do is put some beads in your fist and hope for the best.  However, if you're the kind of person who can keep track of what the other players have previously bid and won, you could probably figure out a strategy.  I think that playing the same cards multiple times with a changing supply of beads is really interesting because a player can't always bid the same thing that worked before, and the thing that worked in past rounds won't necessarily work again.  Also the shrunken heads are humorous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The blind bidding in this game is pretty interesting, as the gems you're bidding with don't have a definite value.  Everyone is trying to get some kinds of gems while getting rid of others, and at the same time try to fulfill cards that will get them (or their opponents) more of certain kinds of gems.  I found this process to be pretty interesting.  What I didn't like was that if players were tied, neither of them won, and instead the next placed player won.  So sometimes you were trying to come in behind two players who tied, which is really kind of counterintuitive (and hard when you're blind bidding).

(2 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Simple yet tense and intriguing game. Basically you're collecting different sorts of diamonds. For some sets you need to have the most, for other sorts you need to have the least.

Completely different game with two or tree players. Absolutely no comparison. Obviously, with two players there's always one/no-one of the two players that wins the bidding. In a 3+ player game the dynamics are completely different. You can loose and still get a beneficial deal. You can also win a bidding round and get a bad deal out of it.

A five player game turned out to be very strange and unpredictable. Didn't like it much. Unclear rules.

I love the artwork and illustrations with the references to beheaded celebrities (Gene Simmons, Friedemann Friese, Bart Simpson, ...).

I get a headacke from this game. You mostly try to think what other people think (and they think you and others think) and make a sensible bid based on that. It usually doesn't work, at least for me, which is infuriating.

Fair warning: I love Friedemann.  I'm a lot more forgiving of anything he does just because I dig his vibe.  That said, this is a fun bidding game that's simple enough for younger players, but loaded with "what're they bidding?" deduction for adults to enjoy.  Kids probably won't win, but you never know...
The gems concern me...lose one and you're going to have to find another copy of the game.

This game has a very random feel to it. The players offer 1-4 jewels each round and try to be the only one offering a certain amount of jewels for four different requirements. It involves second-guessing other players but still it's very much based on luck whether you succeed in being the only one making a certain offer. Somewhat frustrating but overall harmless filler.

This is much like an even more ludicrous version of Edel, Stein & Reich. Very chaotic and often very funny. Hilarity ensues as the players attempt to craft a tiny economic engine out of plastic beads.

Loved the heads. Hated the cards. 
Generally I like blind bidding and bidding games in general. This one just seemed very blah.

One odd note: The whole game is basically about breaking ties, but if you tie for the win, you just tie. Argh. 

Stop spending so much time on the green hair dye and more on producing games like Power Grid. I know you have another big one in ya. ;)

Oft maligned for being chaotic, I contend that this game requires the skill of reading your opponents rather than interpreting and implementing a set formula.  Thus many highly intellectual yet non-intuitive people will hate this game.  With the right group it's quite fun.  Some of the decision making and opponent reading can be rather complex and difficult, but to me that adds something that most biding games are lacking.

Boy, do I ever stink at this game!  In my first game, I think I broke the record for the worst score ever.  I didn't score a single point in our four-player game.  Apparently, there's a strategy, but I couldn't figure it out.  After hearing the rules, I think I decided that there wasn't a proper strategy or that I would need some type of a strategy flow chart each round to have chance with this game.  Well, apparently that theory didn't work!  I'm not the Amazing Kreskin, so I'm not much for games that involve me attempting to read my opponents' minds like Pirate's Cove, Hoity Toity, or Fury of Dracula.

I've got to say that I really like the logic puzzle the way that the cards all work together.  The heads are awesome and the craptastic beads kind of add to the humor.  As far as the rest of the "game" how can you not just roll your eyes at it.  It is just so ridiculous that it actually becomes pretty funny.  With three players there is a sliver of control here, I couldn't imagine that it would even be worth playing with four or five.  The advantage is it is short and silly.  I wouldn't recommend buying it, but I don't feel the urge to trade it.  Looking at the design as a whole, it feels like throwing a bunch of meat in a grinder to see if the sausage tastes good.  I find that all the cleverness of the card interaction gets blanched by the chaos. Nonetheless for as poor as the results of gameplay are, this is more fun than it is good.  Really my enjoyment is all I care about in a game.

UPDATE: Oh man is this game stupid with 5 players.  But still I kind of enjoy it and I will probably play it again.  I can't explain it.  The worse it gets the more I like it (raised rating to a 6).

Some good ideas for a game but there is something missing, perhaps variability in your actions each round.  It's also non-intuitive where it can be a challenge just to determine who gets what each round.  Seems like it needs at least one more layer.

I thought this was clever, and I enjoyed it.  I think I'd rate it higher if it was a little shorter, but I would not mind playing more of it as a 30 minute filler.  My biggest complaint is probably that someone will likely be eliminated from contention before the final round due to the way scoring works.  Not a big deal in a game this short.  If you like blind bidding as a mechanic, you may want to take a look at this one.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  It wasn't a bad warm-up game I guess.. I could see playing this as a filler game again sometime, sure.  Certainly not what I would consider a main event game.  There is just not a lot of good decision making points in the game.  It has a large chaos factor.  The game playing comes down to making guesses as to what several other players might be bidding.  Which is okay I guess, not great but okay and provided some entertainment value.

very clever game that does make your head hurt
so if you like this part of gaming then give it a go.
the idea is to anticipate how all player's treasure collection is going to vary as a turn progresses and to end the turn with the set of jewels that meets the winning condition. If you do then you get a couple of shrunken heads for reward. Nice
But there are tension building twists that give you the chance to upset your friends(Well, improve the game results for yourself is another way to look at this).
One of the few games that has NO luck at all.

Wow, that's a bit crazy.  4 rounds of 3 blind bids.  Each round has 4 winning criteria (the most of this color and the least of this color, etc) all counted from the same bid.  Each winning criteria is associated with a result (positive or negative) and at the end of each round you get some points (shrunken heads).   After 4 rounds most points wins.  Not my kind of game, but at least it's over quickly. 2008/11/17

This was an amusing game, perhaps too long to be a filler, but too light to be a real game.  Players simultaneously choose a number of different colored gems, and whoever has the most or fewest of certain types will determine who gets or loses more gems.  Then at the end of four rounds, points are awarded for whoever has the most or fewest of certain types (of which the criteria can change).

Maybe not the best description, but it's basically all about the simultaneous selection.  Another interesting thing is that if people tie, they cancel and it goes to the next player.  So say there is a really good effect for whoever has the fewest green gems.  3 players choose 0 and one player chooses 1.  The three players all cancel, so the last player gets the effect.  So maybe everyone anticipates the other players will choose 0, so everyone chooses 1, and the one guy with 0 gets the benefit.  That's the gist of the game.  It's highly random, but reasonably fun.

If you're looking for a game filled with celebrity shrunken heads and piles of glittering gems, Fiji is probably your best choice.  There are plenty of brain-burning decisions as action cards are flipped, slid, and re-sequenced,  But at the end of the day, this is a blind-bidding game with auctions that are very difficult to value.

A game of serialised bids, where you're trying to get strictly less/more than other players in varios colour combinations (from your stock) to get action benefits. ALl this to try and end up best matching the goal cards at the end of the round, oh, and your lose your bids to the supply as well.

It loses a point for being frustrating, but it does play quickly with many groans and disappointment around the table as someone else goes in the particular direction you chose.

Finally got this one on the table and generated a lot of laughs.  Was fun and light but honestly seems a bit cumbersome with the cards given how little was really happening within the game.  Good fun game that I will play from time to time but not itching to get it out there all the time either. 

UPDATE : Although this can generate some laughs it's not fun enough to struggle through the work to play the game. Other games will always hit the table first. Lowered rating. 

UPDATE: What a terrible game. Lowering it to a 3 was a good idea.

I am rarely so entertained by such a bad game. The multiple objective blind bidding is actually an interesting mechanic. And it can be sort of fun to figure out exactly how you are going to make the gem objectives using the very crude tools at your disposal. Fiji is the textbook example of lack of control. The theme is great though, and the shrunken heads amazing, so it can be an enjoyable experience to play this awful game.

This is one of those special category of games where you reach the end and your honest praise for it is "Well, at least it was short!"

Flux with gems.  Actually its not as random as flux but it feels like it when you're playing.  Combines two aspects of games I least enjoy, guessing human nature and blind bidding.

Mmmmm.... Fiji. I'm full. I don't know if I ever need to play this again. There's not so much a game here as a series of conditional if/then statements you fulfill based on only quasi-guessing what your opponents will do. Often it doesn't matter. In fact, often nothing you do in the game matters, as the spread of action cards will simply dictate a very specific order of operations, or everything ends up in ties and nothing gets resolved. Wretched game.

Green boxes. We now what this means. A game designed by Friedemann Friese. For one, still unknown, reason, we have a weak spot for this man. When we find a game designed by him, most of the time, we buy it. Why? As said, that is still unknown. He designed a lot of games, and the best game he designed is Power Grid. Most of his other games, aren’t that great. But we just buy and try games he designed.
Fiji is another game he designed. Nothing special. It’s a typical “I think-that you think-that I think-that you think-that you…-etc.”-kind of game. Nothing deep, nothing special. Nice and funny design. When you keep the funny part in the back of your head, you know exactly what this game is. Funny.

I really like the mechanisms to determine the goals for the round and the tools that will allow you to strive for those goals.  In practice, I really dislike the ties-cancel-each-other mechanism that affects every play of the game, which enabled me to have both the most and the least of a color at the same time.  It's zany, yes, but it turns the game into a crapshoot.  The choices for shrunken heads are good for a chuckle.

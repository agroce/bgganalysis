Excellent game. The mechanics and scoring of the game are simple. This elegant abstract game is one of the best you'll play and it is lots of fun to play. Its interesting that good players find it surprisingly difficult to describe how to play this game well and often come up with different ideas and suggestions for the same position.

I enjoyed this.  Played it online.  Problem was, I'm colorblind, so I couldn't tell the difference between the yellow and green pieces.  Quite an interesting handicap.

I like this as a one-player Java game (see Eric Solomon's site).  Playing Order is an entertaining way to spend five minutes.  Playing Chaos is too brain-burning and I prefer to leave it to the computer.

Plenty of thinking involved here trying to beat your opponent and get a personal best high score. I wish Entropy would be picked up and offered to the English speaking world.

Interesting Abstract that has just a touch of randomness because of the tile draw.  It's easier to analyze though because there are only five of each so you know exactly what's left.

Oh, this is good; although you can get screwed by (e.g.) not drawing one colour for a long time as Chaos.

Two player game in which you try to create palindromes in colors. Players alternate roles, one is drawing a disc from the bag and placing it (Chaos), the other may move one previous placed disc (Order).

RATING: 8
Pleasing play, elegant abstract game.  It is easy to establish a handicap system if players are unequal in ability.  

I have the Hyle 7 version, which is substantively different than Hyle.

Sold! My copy was made by the designer, I bought it at the London Mindsports Olympiad.

I've played it the other way round, Chaos draws and places to randomise, Order slides the discs to form the symmetrical patterns. The game is fairly luck dependent. If Chaos draws the same colours early on, it is easy to move them to places which will make symmetry, and the other colours will be drawn later, further increasing the symmetry.

This box has the least shelf appeal of any game I own (even Caledea in the Pizza box-at least that is intriguing).  If I hadn't read comments & ratings first, and purchased online I would have never picked Hyle up.  That certainly says something about my being swayed by commercial packaging & retailing.  

One of the photos here shows the black & white box of which I am speaking, but labels it Hyle 7.  This box was sold to me as Hyle Deluxe and has only a 5x5 board (not a 7x7), all pieces & board in wood.  

This is a brain burner.  Easy for me to be Chaos, but order is going to take a lot of practice for me.  

So thankful for the online rules in English.

I did not realize till now Eric Soloman also did Black Box, one of my favorite games for decades.

Entropy is Eric Solomon's masterpiece (followed closely by Corporation). The game involves two players, chaos and order, who thematically... BAH... it's just an abstract. However, the formation of palindromes for scoring is a master stroke. The 5x5 game squarely falls in the super-filler category, but I prefer the 7x7 game.

[2015.04.01]

This game is quite elegant with the perfect mix of randomness, take-that, and brain-burning.  Another game that I wish I had invented.

Hyle feels very little like a game and more like a puzzly, pattern recognition exercise. I really like the idea of order vs. chaos and I think this concept would be great if modernized and introduced into a Euro or something a little fresher.  Otherwise, it was interesting to play but doesn't really foster repeated experiences.  I feel the luck of the draw has more to do with it than I feel comfortable with and pitting two peoples' pure ability to pattern order is rather dry.  All that being said, it was still intriguing to play.

One of my favorite themeless two-player positional games, a category that often doesn't fit my tastes.  I like the asymmetry, the variety from game to game, and the way that the random draw foils rehearsed strategies.

I'll give any game a chance if it's just glass gems on a grid, but this one seems to be light on fun. Basically the chaos player does whatever is necessary to stop the formation of any 5-patterns and meanwhile the order player makes as many 3-patterns as the draw sequence will allow.

Excellent abstract. I gave it an 8. This is the highest score I've given to a pure abstract to date. Score is likely to drop however if I don't play this.
Rating based on couple of plays here.
http://www.ericsolomon.co.uk/en/entropy.html

Managed to score 71 in third game as order, First two plays were to get the scoring right. (Big) diagonals don't count.

The game consists of two roles. One is the chaos part. He places a stone on the grid (empty spot) Move 1. The second role is Order He can can move a pip that's on the board horizontaly  or vertically without jumping.that's move 2. You score for palandromes.
These moves are repeated untill the grid is full.
Since only the Order part can score you play the game twice (once as order once as chaos)

It's simple yet there is much room for strategy (or tactics) .. you know what I mean...

Since there can be a huge difference in skill. I would suggest that the experienced player takes the role as order first and explains the scoring during the game. He should also handicap himself. By taking some points of his score. So that the new player has a goal that he can get close to.

Excellent abstract strategy game.  The little luck can be removed entirely with a "simultaneous play" variant - players play two boards (order and chaos) and one colored stone is pulled for both.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Purely tactical and needing to be played twice with a reversal of roles for fairness - yet it doesn't matter. Hyle boasts a crisp idea (chaos vs. order) and is stripped down to the core, but its easy flow keeps the game miles away from feeling dry: it can be played again and again, even by more than two players in a round robin (watching games evolve is fun as well). 

If the 5x5 board becomes dull (it doesn't have to be that way at all, decisions become more and more difficult after each play), the expansion to the 7x7 board with 7 colours shakes things up quite a bit.

2 play abstract game with very colorful discs. Ok I was drawn in by the colorful discs but the game play is very interesting as well. You have to play 2 rounds so each person can score points. One round will be for trying to block your opponent from getting points and one round for you to try and score as many points. I have to say if you are a fan of abstracts you should check it out.

Neato, but I know very little about it. It seems like it's easy to make. I like the way the board looks though, so I'll see if I can find it cheap somewhere.

A great 2 player non-symetrical abstract that uses tile drawing and yet still feels more strategic than say Carcassone.

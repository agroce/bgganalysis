This rating is for Message to the Czar. Didn't like it at all.
I've never played Muscat, but apparently it is much better.

RATING: 8
Muscat feels very different from any other game I've played, and it plays well with 3, 4, or 5.
I agree with Stan H's comment that it's a thinly-themed abstract; this bothers some people. I also agree with his comment that the end condition could use some tweaking.

I played Message to the Czar, which I understand, has slightly different rules.  Played it only once, and, I think, incorrectly.  Even with all those caveats, I didn&#039;t care for it.  But I&#039;d be wiling to give it another chance.

5 for Message to the Czar.  6 for Muscat.  These are really two different games, although they are both based on the same mechanic.  In Message to the Czar although luck plays a large role, skillful play is still generally rewarded.  The &quot;press-your-luck&quot; ending may not be to everyone&#039;s taste.  It didn&#039;t bother me, but if it does bother you, you can simply eliminate it.  Muscat is another bird altogether...a total brain burn with many, many things to consider each turn. To my mind definitely a gamer&#039;s game.  It is certainly a richer game of significant tactical and strategic depth.  (Unfortunately there are not enough pieces included in Message to the Czar to play it using the Muscat rules.  So I used my trusty digital camera to make my own.)  All that being said, I am not a great fan of either game.  They are very puzzle-like and I just don&#039;t enjoy that type of game much.  I appreciate their clever design, but don&#039;t really find either of them all that much fun.  For the right kind of player, however, I think they both, especially Muscat, could be very rewarding.

I've played Message to the Czar. It's a fairly straightforward race game with only minimal choices. Unfortunately, the end game, in an effort to hold back the leaders, seems a bit too random, and the theme doesn't fit the mechanics very well.

I bought "Muscat" after anticipating "Message to the Czar" and hearing that it ruined the previous game's system with a ill-advised "push your luck" mechanism .  Intially, I thought this game didn't look like much and I thought it was kind of unattractive.  What a pleasant surprise I had when the game arrived!  The graphic design is simple, elegant, and very colourful- the pictures here don't do it justice.  The gameplay is unique and excellent once you get a handle on the rules, which are a wee bit fiddly regarding the actions available to "vagrant" tiles so the first couple of games might be more or less learning experiences.  Lots of potential for strategic, brain-burning play, crafty moves, and dramatic turnarounds.  This is really an outstanding game, particularly if you are burned out on the usual area majority/auction/racing/tile laying fare so common to designer games.  One more accolade- it's by a female designer, which is unfortunately uncommon.  Yet again, it's a Euro that's not worth more than a few plays, which is unfortunate because it's a pretty unique mechanic.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting game. Only played once so far. As you may know this game has a rock paper sissors element. It has some tactical and some strategic longer term elements. I'm not sure quite what to make of it. It's definitely worth playing again to get another look at the strategies. After that its hard to say.

Uses the Paper, Rock, Scissors mechanic, but actually does it well.  The thing that was hard to wrap my head around was utilizing the Vagrant tiles effectively, which seems to be the way to win.  Anyway, not a bad game and glad to have played it. Also uses a bit of musical chairs mechanic. Neat game.

I find the game quite original in its own way. Some luck. Some downtime.

I would like to play it again some day. Climbing the different levels is cool. The top level could be dealt a bit differently. It's random as a recall with a dice. Dice rolling for final spot is a turn off in my opinion. Everything else is well done.

RATING: 4
Played 3 times. My rating for this will either go up as I figure out the tactics, or down if it is too dry and repetitive. The endgame problem people describe doesn't bother me that much, and if it did, I think I would just use the "fix" Winning Moves has recently released. See "rtrowan" article for official endgame variant. // Tried the fix and ran into problems with coin supply. And I didn't think it really fixed anything anyways! I am having a very hard time understanding the tactics. My friends really enjoyed playing (we played twice in a row) but nobody really had an idea of what to do to really accomplish some stunning moves. Every time you get setup to skip, an inn empties out and leaves you stuck with a normal move. Unless I start to understand the tactics, I just can't see playing this too much as it is a one-mechanic pony, and a little on the abstract side. [F-R] [Will trade my copy of Message to the Czar.]

This rating is for the original game Muscat; most of the other low ratings appear to be for the Message to Czar edition, which many say ruined the game.  If you ask me, there wasn't much of a game to ruin in the first place.  Others in my group enjoy it, but I found it to be a bore.  I'm unable to succinctly explain why it bored me, but I felt the same general sense of malaise that I experienced with the somewhat-similar Bridges of Shangri-La.

Three plays, twice with five and once with three. A unique middleweight game. Might appear dry at first glance, but the sneaky ne'er-do-well moves and the large amount of player interaction on the board keep things lively. As might be expected, there is more control in the three-player game than in the five-player game.

Clever and original central mechanic (the "cycle of power"), with a simple and efficient scoring system. Much better than the most recent version "Message to the Czar", which is not so ugly but was dumbed down in an effort to streamline the gameplay, keeping the central mechanic but butchering the scoring system.

An interesting game that has players advancing pieces up ladder in order to score points. The game is dry, something I'm not usually bothered by, it is also prone to a lot of analysis down time. I'd play again but it won't become a part of my own collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Abstract with pasted-on theme. My first play (four players) left me wondering how much the own actions influence the game or if the game is won by the player who gets hit on the least. The two players who used the most special actions got in last while the winner didn't use a single special action against anybody else. With more experience we might make the special actions work, i.e. gaining more VP's than is lost by losing one of your artists as payment for this action. Otherwise, the game will move down in rating. The game might be better with three. With four or more I'm not sure if it is any use trying to plan ahead. There are already a multitude of possibilities for the current turn and the resulting analysis paralysis will bring the game to a grinding halt while the results are in doubt.

My rating is for Muscat.  I didn't care much for 'Message to the Czar' b/c the endgame didn't do it for me - I like everything up until the final phases).

("Message to the Czar" version)
Not bad.  Has a puzzle aspect that reminds me a bit of Cafe International -- but the strategy is barely there.  Perhaps when playing with 4 to 5 this will liven up; but with two and three (which are the numbers in the only games of this I've played) it's rather dry and it comes down to luck in the bribing phase.

Upon first glance this didn't look like a game I would be into.  The game, although mostly tactical has much more going on than meets the eye.  Sure, there's a rock, scissors, paper mechanism to determine who goes forward towards the palace & who is relegated to the ditch; however these "battles" are not blind.  For the most part one sees who they're up against & tries to maneuver their performers into positions where they would be strongest in the cycle of power.  Another great aspect is that if a performer is defeated it can invoke never-do-well powers -- use these at key times to hop to the top!  Pay close attention, the game can end much more quickly than you realize.

Each player has 16 street performers (cobras, elephants, flutists and flamers). The board has 5 levels. Your performers work their way up the different levels (where there are higher VPs) by "power struggles", a rock, papers, scissors format with the other performers filling in your area. Only played once in May 03, but it seemd like an okay game at the time, 7 out of 10.

There's significantly more long-term planning than expected from a game that bills itself out as an advanced "rock-paper-scissors".  Very good mix between short-term tactics and long-term strategy, including knowing when to lose a power struggle in order to better utilize a bit as a vagrant.  What happened to this company?

I'll gladly play it again, but I'll have to be in the mood for a brain-burner.

Played alternative rules to Message to the Czar and was disappointed with the luck in drawing money chits. I'd like to play again where each chit was worth one point and all bribes cost 10 points (no drawing when you reach the guards), to create a balance between the race for the top and the race to earn money.

I have only played &quot;Message to the Czar&quot;.  I like the funky machinations to get up to the guards (although it is a bit dry), but the final bit does not sit well with me at all.  I understand that there had to be &quot;good&quot; guards and &quot;bad&quot; guards, but there should have been a different way to collect the rubles.  As is, the end is very random and (worse) disjointed from the rest of the game.  The graphic design IS quite cool.

RATING: 7.5
Muscat:  Multitudes of expanding option.  Try to figure out what is going to happen by the next turn, I dare you.  I really like the system in this, quite simple in mechanics and easy to grock, yet once it gets going there are so many things to keep in mind.  This is a great lightweight game that feels much larger.    Prepare yourself to be subject to whims of fate though.  As people move up someone has to get screwed, there are times where you just get hosed all around, and there isn't much you can do.  You must accept this possibility if you want to play it.

Fun game! I played Message to the Czar, a remake of this, many years ago. I don't remember much about it although I rated it a 6 way back then -- likely would be lower now? I remember only something about promoting people up towards the top of the board, although I thought it was a lot less involved in the revision.

In Muscat, the board shows several rows of rooms (4 spots each) with a street below each. Players have the same mix of face down tiles, several copies showing one of 4 icons (matching the spots in the rooms). Keep one face up. On your turn, you can play your face up tile (or flip another one and play that one) by placing it into an available matching spot in a room of the bottom row. Or, if a room has 3 tiles in it, you can cycle it: highest 2 tiles (furthest clockwise) moves up to next row (to matching spot if available; skip to next row if all spots full), lowest drops to street level of that row. Or, you can do a special action which can swap tiles or moves them from one room to another AND triggers a cycling. The game ends when there are __ (8?) tiles at the top level.  Then you score +VP for all tiles in rooms, -VP for tiles in streets; highest sum wins!

I like the way you have to figure out how to use the special powers to promote your guys up the chain. There's just a bit of randomness -- the right amount -- in the order in which your tiles become available. The rest is all player interaction and problem-solving/deduction. I might have to dig out our (rethemed) copy!

Eh. I played Message to the Czar. Reading the description for Muscat I notice a few rules that we weren't using in Message so either we were playing it wrong or there are differences between the two.  Message plays okay but the end game seems broken--the random drawing for rubles just doesn't do it for me.  Muscat sounds like an interesting game though.

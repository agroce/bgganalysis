RANK: 918

RATING: 6
Initial couple of plays leaves an impression is this is what happens when Spades (mechanically) marries Hearts (strategically), and lives with Red7 (card powers on odd numbers & hand management). An interesting way of getting around the traditional problems of 2p trick taking. The 6 buried cards (that you can sort of filter through with the three 5s) leaves you with just enough information that isn't known to create an interesting dynamic between the info you know (your hand and prior plays) and what you don't (what's left in the deck which prevents you from mathing out what they have). You get reasonable assumptions; if you're heavy in one suit, they likely have a large cache of another, etc. My biggest ding is the HTI of what's been played. For a game that is clever enough to have that balance, the HTI of what's been played seems to short circuit it and ultimately attempt a balance of preventing AP by speeding the game along. From an academic perspective, I wonder if knowing just the suit of what's been played would be sufficient to bridge that gap.

Either way, it's a cute little game and I'd play it. I'm not sure I'd buy a copy, and it's a niche game; a really thinky trick taker that doesn't support higher counts. For what it does, I think it works.

Really interesting trick-taking game.  Reasonably deep, as blowout victories are actually blowout losses, and there are enough "tricky" cards to prevent perfect information even while there aren't enough to make it into a crapshoot.

Would definitely be interested in owning this, and look forward to playing again!

A two player trick taking game with some merit.  The odd numbered cards have special powers attached to them which adds some fun to your hand.  How much fun?  Not that sure after one play.  May go up or down on future plays, but in general, it seems like a fairly solid two player game.

The Fox in the Forest is a trick-taking game for two players. Aside from the normal ranked- and suited-cards, there are special characters cards that give players extra abilities to change the trump suit, lead even after you lose a trick, and more.
You score points by winning more tricks than your opponent, but don't get greedy...win too many tricks, and you can actually loose.

Fox in the Forest is a big success. The game has a really neat scoring mechanic where you really have to watch the tricks you take throughout the game. Combined with the different card abilities this is a great way to design a 2 player trick taking game.

Getting a good trick taking game with 2 is tricky.  Potato man does it well with  each player playing 2 cards/suits in a trick and Haggis (a hybrid) does it by not having a prescribed end to a trick.  Be interesting to see how this compares - have printed out the functional if ugly prototype and if it works I can see myself picking this up.

The theming for this game doesn't really help with rules memorization or anything, it feels really tacked on. The play of the game is fine. Having a set of cards placed aside to give the deck some hidden information is alright, but it doesn't reward risky play as well. The game skews more towards conservative and thoughtful play than most trick taking cards typically do, which meant it also ran a bit longer than I'd want a two player trick taking game to go. I was happy when it ended.

I just don't think Trick Taking games are for us.  I look at my hand... and have no idea what to do.  I thought this would be different because of the powers and the really cool scoring system, but it's just not for me.  The decisions are too opaque, I don't know when (if?) to pivot to a different strategy, and I don't find the choices compelling.

For the 20 minutes it takes to play, we can usually find something that is more our style.

Smartly designed two-player trick taking. The action cards allow enough player agency to that clever play can overcome a less than optimal deal.

An attempt to create a 2-player trick taker by granting benefits to half the cards and by scoring in a slightly unusual way. This one, like Triumvirate, is decent, and I enjoy playing it, but a first rate 2-player trick taker is yet to be produced, assuming it's even possible.

Excellent two player trick taking game.  It's a basic trick taker, with three suits 1-11, however the odd numbered cards each have interesting, game changing powers.  It's not too heavy, but with some lovely decision points.  The scoring system, where you want to win the majority of tricks, but not too many, is wonderful.

This is an interesting trick-taking game for two players. I didn't know what to think of it, but Triumvirate showed that it's possible. You play a mostly standard trick-taking game with 3 suits with values from 1-11. The twist is that all odd numbered cards have a special ability. Players have the opportunity to shoot the moon by losing enough tricks, that they will score more points than the player who won a lot. The number of tricks you take, determine what your score is at the end of the game. There are various recommendations of how many points to play to, but players can just decide. I wasn't a huge fan of Triumvirate, but this is really good. While Haggis fills the climbing game niche for 2, this fills the trick-taking niche for 2. The artwork is also really nice on the cards. This is a good one you should check out if you play 2-player games regularly.

RATING: 7
The Fox in the Forest is a two player trick-taking game, and this premise alone warrants praise. Just like any other trick-taking game players have a trump suit to abide by, and must follow suit, which makes the game incredibly intuitive and easy to teach. Mix in a few card powers, and a non-linear scoring mechanism, and out comes the single greatest non-gamer game in history. Any one who enjoys the classic card games of old (Euchre, Hearts, etc) will immediately be at home in the Forest and enjoy its unique take. Play a Swan to lead the next trick, or the Monarch to neutralize your opponent's best cards, or play the Fox to pivot the trump suit and score more tricks. There is a shoot-the-moon element as well, which creates great culminations at the end of each hand. Its a bit too simple for me to play often, but it nails its unique premise and I will recommend this to just about everyone.

A 2 player only trick taking game with a fantasy fairy tale theme. You are each dealt 13 cards and the game proceeds like a regular trick taker where you try to win the tricks...or not! There are a couple of twists...The first is that all of the odd cards have special powers that you can use to your advantage such as using a Fox to change the trump suit, or the Witch to count as the trump suit if there is only one 9 in the trick. I feel that the special powers help to ameliorate a bad draw. The final twist is that depending on the number of tricks you win you earn points. You ideally want to win 0-3 or 7-9 tricks as they give you 6 points. While I have won it at the tricky 0-3 level, most of the big points come from winning 7-9 tricks as it's fairly easy for your opponent to stick you with some wins if they notice you are trying to keep a low profile. The standard game length is to 21 points. You have the option of playing a shorter game to 16 points or a longer game to 35 points. We played our first couple of games to 16 points and our next few to 21. The time difference is negligible but the rounds tend to feel a bit repetitive so I wouldn't want to play a much longer game. Both 16 and 21 are fine lengths, but I think 35 would do my head in. 

First of all, the artwork is completely gorgeous. This is one of those games that you could keep just because of the artwork and it's in a nice small box so it doesn't even take up that much space. The game in general was fine. It's cute, works well as a game and the special powers are fun to use, but we just have a lot of really really good, more fun, more tense, more...everything card games. I really liked playing it, and wouldn't mind playing again, but...on to other things! Recommended for players just building their collections or those who don't already have tons of 2 player only games or card games. A pleasant way to pass 20 minutes.

Its very strange playing a trick taking game with only 2 players and the majority of the cards 'out' but otherwise this is an interesting take.

I think the odd cards having abilities is what makes this however I feel the 6 points for winning half (7) the tricks is a little high as generally we only play 3-4 rounds before someone hits the required points to win I really like that you can manipulate which card is trumps and there are cards that let you change up who leads after each trick.

Hát nem vagyok nagy rajongója az akár franciakártyával is játszható társasoknak. Mármint a kifejezetten kártyás játékokat szeretem, de az ilyeneknél azt érzem, hogy ezt most minek kellett kiadni, ha lehetne egy pakli kártyával is. Itt különösen fájó, hogy fantasztikus grafikákat pazaroltak el erre a teljesen tematika nélküli ütésvivős játékra. Ráadásul szerintem nem is egy jó ütésvivős darab, mert a tervezhetőségét nullának érzem a pontozás és az adu változása miatt. Így nekem kifejezetten frusztráló volt játszani.

Fox in the Forest is (at the time of writing) the newest member in the ever growing family of newfangled trick-takers with a twist. Even more unique, it is one that is solely designed for two!

In this ever small category, I still think that Triumvirate reigns. Yet, FitF offers a great degree of flexibility and accessibility. The twists are small yet still meaningful as to feel like a "love letter" to traditional trick takers.

However, I feel as though there is a bit more looseness than I would like within a trick-taker for two. Good but not great.

A remarkably good trick-taker for two. Small two-player card games are a personal favorite of mine, and previously my go to game was Haggis. While not replacing Haggis, this is something I would generally choose to play over it.

The play is intriguingly nuanced, and like most great trick takers (Sticheln), hand analysis isn't overly transparent. Most hands have a few different ways you can approach them, and the threat of dumping tricks on your opponent can make for a lot of great tension. There's a good amount of bluff and counter-bluff too, especially around the treasure cards.

I'm curious to see if hand analysis becomes more obvious as time wears on. If so, I could see this slipping a bit.

A well-done two-player trick taking game.  The combination of the scoring system and special cards make this an excellent two-player game.  A cliff-scoring system rewards you for shooting, but punishes you if you only take 4 of the 13 tricks.  Likewise, you are reward for taking 7 -9 tricks, but are rewarded with zero points for taking 10/13 tricks.  The special power cards add subtle tactics to the game play (e.g change trump, draw a new card, play an off suit card as a trump).  If you are looking for a two-player trick taking game, you need look no further.

Very intrigued by this game after 2 plays. Played on an airplane by putting the cards into a standard playing card tuck box, so the score was kept in our heads instead of with VP chits. It serves fantastic as a travel game, and feels like it has a lot of depth for a trick taking game. The special cards keep throwing off any strategy I've tried, so I don't feel I've figured this one out - but looking forward to doing so. Great couples game as well.

This game is perfect for couples who love to game together. I played it consistantly at our local game shop with my gf and ended up picking up a copy on the way out. Its fast, fun, and got lovely art. 
One of my favorite things about this game is unlike most trick taking games, it forces you to lose at least 4 tricks, or take less than 4 total yourself. So if you have a wonderful hand ready to take all the tricks, youll have to find out how you could give away a few tricks at least or end up with nothing.

RATING: 8
Fills in a nice niche (that was previously unfilled as far as I know), namely a two-player trick-taking game. It feels like a simplified shortened version of Wizard; you have to balance between taking too few and too many tricks, masking your strengths/weaknesses and your plans.

Very nice scoring mechanism which seems to work well for many different card distributions, though I'd have to play more to be sure.

Great art. The online story is only so-so, but is not vital to the gameplay. I'm not a big fan of text on cards, but after a few minutes you'll know what all the special cards do without having to read them (since there's only 6 types).

I thought replayability would be poor since it's a little on the simple side, but after a dozen games (each with 3+ rounds), I've found this game has lots of variety and continues to be interesting. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it for trick-taking experts (e.g. Bridge players), but definitely a cute and fun game.

What can I say other than I love this 2-player only trick-taking game that is both fun & rewarding to play as well as gorgeous to look at, with its traditional European forest fantasy theme. Sticks closely to normal trick taking, but with some nice twists in both play (with the odd-numbered special cards & their powers) and scoring (take 10-11-12-13 tricks and you get zero VPs but take 7-8-9 and you get 6). A keeper.

Fast 2-player trick taking game and together with Claim among the best in its genre (there aren't that many 2P games). You need to be lucky with the draw of your hand but based on that you should either try to get 0-3 tricks or 7-9 tricks not more, not less. Playing some 7s at the right time to get some extra VP or 3s to change suit. If you haven't any 3s and cards in the suit color though, it might get tricky. Nice game!

RATING: 8.5
When I heard that this was a two-player trick-taker, I was intrigued. The game has an interesting push/pull feel to it due to the nature of scoring and the special abilities of the odd-numbered cards. After the first play I thought "this is a nice little game," after the next few plays I thought "wow, this is a REALLY nice little game." I wouldn't say it's the best trick-taking game I've played, but for a what it is, it's excellent.

Two years ago, Potato Man taught me a trick-taking game can work in two.

RATING: 8
Precision balanced for multiple playing styles with the clever added results of odd-numbered cards and the narrowed win parameters. Beautiful art, appropriate for all audiences - which is great, because using this game to teach trick-taking and then more advanced strategy to a kid by gradually introducing the powers of the odd cards would be awesome and easily adjusted to skill level - but also intricate, adding to the joy of replay for older audiences, who will find here one of those rare games like Parade. It's just challenging enough to make you say "Another round?" over and over so that you can try different plays, and it's just light enough that admiring the cards or chatting won't interfere too much with play for practiced players. Bonus: small package + small play footprint makes it really easy to lure in unsuspecting new players.

I feel like I'm not yet in a position to judge The Fox in the Forest after two games, but I highly doubt that I'd often choose play this over 2 player Haggis. It's simpler, but I tend to prefer trick takers where every card can be accounted for versus those that require setting some cards aside after dealing (though it's clear why this wouldn't really work in 2p). Some of the powers only further exacerbate this element, making the game seem surprisingly chaotic at times. Still, the seed of a great idea here, I think.

This is one of the few "traditional" card games (if you can still call it that) that I really enjoy, so I think it will keep hitting the table every now and then. I’ll never be a huge fan of the genre, so for me this is about the highest I think a “simple” card game will ever score. The only question is whether my wife (and primary playing partner, especially in two player games) will remain willing to play this with me if I keep beating her consistently...

As of right now, this is my favorite trick taking game. The pace is great. The card art is fantastic. And the gameplay is not just dictated by the best hand. It is who can think more tactically based on the card, powers, the number of tricks won and current trump. Great, great stuff and will continue to be played in my group.

Nice little trick-taking game for 2 players which is quiet rare. The special powers give you some interesting options, but I'm not sure how I feel about the "greed" mechanic. I like the rare cases of going for not winning any tricks and making tons of points in trick-taking games normally, but maybe the range of 0-3 tricks to pull it off is a little too big for me. 
I might have also rated this slightly higher if I didn't discover "Claim" around the same time and I'd probably give an edge to that one, so this might not hit the table as often just because Claim trumps it by a little for us.

Trick-taking is going to be a recurring theme in my collection, so...get used to it.

Trick-taking is hard to do well for 2P. I like the special abilities of all the odd-numbered cards. Scoring is simple, but game play is clever, making it a nice, quick filler.

[b]The Fox in the Forest[/b] was sold via auction 11/18/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]The Fox in the Forest is an excellent [b]2p[/b] trick taking game that follows the basic structure of classic trick takers. The designer did an excellent job of coming up with enough twists to create a deeply strategic trick taker for only two players. In the game there are three suits which are numbered 1 - 11 and all of the odd numbered cards have a special ability that triggers when the card is played. While the abilities are straight forward [i]i.e. playing a 3 allows you to change the trump suit)[/i], they create a lot of opportunity for clever play. All of the abilities are directly tied to the normal game play features found in classic trick takers and not a collection of random rules that would leave you wondering if the game is a trick taker at all. Even for experienced card players it'll take a few plays to wrap your head around the game and newbies will be at a serious disadvantage; which is a testament to the amount of depth to be uncovered through repeated play. 

The way scoring works each round will eliminate any complaint of the random card deal. To score the optimal number of points [i](6)[/i] you either want to take 0-3 or 7-9 out of 13 tricks. Take 10+ tricks and you score 0. IF you score between 4-6 tricks you'll get a few points, more the closer you get to 7. Each round you need to evaluate your hand and decide whether the strength of your hand is taking or passing tricks, which forms the basis of your strategy for the round.

I've only played The Fox in the Forest five times, but it is definitely a game I want keep playing to uncover the different strategies. I truly appreciate designers that can achieve so much with so little; who knew that you only needed three suits and thirty three cards to make an excellent 2p trick taking game?![/i]

RATING: 7
The love for trick-taking games is that every hand is a new challenge and there's always something to chat about with the other players after. It's a fun social. I never thought that a 2-player trick-taker would be successful, mainly because you either know where the cards lie or there's too many cards taken out to make it much more than guess-work. But I've really liked this implementation. The card effects are great - rotating the lead, forcing play, changing trump, etc - just the right number to make you think carefully about your lead. And I love the point scoring system, where you can score well with both low and high hands, but you still need to arrange things such that your opponent wins just enough tricks to take them out of the misere bonus range, but fewer than you. As well as managing the intra-hand scoring (ie win those 7's)! They're easy rules and it plays in the right timeframe. The only reason for not rating it higher is that in a two player game I'm usually after a more thematic adventure, plus I'm unsure yet what kind of legs it has. But this would be a great game to play while travelling for example and I might still yet pick it up for times like those.

RATING: 7.5
A two player trick taking game, seems unlikely to be good but this game pulls it off very well. First off the artwork on the special cards is very nice so that is a good start. As you expect you simply each play a card and top card wins with the trump overpowering the others. But the odd numbered cards (from 1 to 11 per suit) have a special powers which are subtle and not overpowering giving the game just the right amount of variance.

RATING: 8
A nice tricktaker at a tricky player count. 'Standard' suit-following and trumps are enriched by a cliff-edge scoring system (you really want to take either 0-3 or 7-9 of the 13 tricks) and well-judged special powers. There are only six different powers and they almost all tie directly into the trick-taking, the effect being to make the 'guaranteed' winners and losers less of a sure thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pleasant diversion!

Perhaps the game is too balanced? With "classic" trick taking games like Schnapsen, often one player will have an overwhelmingly powerful hand. To make these kinds of wildly imbalanced games even more exciting, players with powerful hands have incentives to gain even more points by taking more risks! As a result, each round in classic trick taking games feels wildly different. But then again, to balance the effect of wildly varying strengths of hands, you have to play many rounds; a match of Schnapsen is about 7-10 rounds. For The Fox in the Forest, it's only about 4. So kudos to the designers of The Fox in the Forest for designing a game that's tight until then end with so little number of rounds.

Then again, one peculiarity about trick taking games in general is that most card plays are forced. The Fox in the Forest mitigates that a bit by giving special powers to many of the cards. Still, I found the rounds of The Fox in the Forest a bit samey. I hope that once I get comfortable with the potential of each of the cards' special powers, I can better anticipate my opponent's plays and play more strategically and less tactically.

(-) High replayability due to quick rounds, like any trick-taker, but lacking depth. High-low cards is the ultimatum despite some neat card-specific powers.

Clever game. Hard to decide whether to go for no tricks or most (but not all tricks) based on your hand and how the first few tricks go for most hands. I personally think it may have lasted a round longer than it should have (feels like it should be a short game but ended up playing 4 rounds, and it almost went to 5), but that's fixable with house ruling it to go to a few less points than 21.

Ummm. I don't know exactly what to say about this one. I liked it. I even thought it was good. But I get pretty frustrated while playing it for some reason. I think the thing that makes the game unique is what I don't like about it. I don't like that I can only either win 0-3 tricks or between 7-9 tricks to get the good points. That part is a bit frustrating to me and difficult to figure out. Not a bad game. It's designed well.

We have only played a couple of times, but I think it is my favorite trick-taking game of all time, and could potentially climb to my favorite two player only game. Trick taking games are all about the stress and frustration that happens when your opponent(s) spoil your perfectly crafted plans by playing exactly the one card that ruins you. This game has that in spades, especially the fox cards that allow you to exchange the decree card for one in your hand. It is the dirtiest mechanic in a card game that I have seen. What separates this game from Hearts, Haggis, or Oh Hell for me is that it is so much easier to change strategies on the fly in this game. You were going for 9 tricks originally and then started losing a few unlucky tricks? Just throw down a fox and change the decree card to something you know your opponent has a ton of and try for humble! This game is pretty much perfect.

As a quick and simple 2-player game I really like it.  My wife and I both like Euchre a lot and this hits that feel without needing to find other players.

[Foxtrot 17 Edition] {Novel; trick-taking; 2p} There aren't many good trick taking games for 2p.  So, I am highly interested in The Fox in the Forest when it shows up in BGG.

The card play follows traditional trick-taking game: follow lead suit, trump card, highest card wins.  The special elements of this game is the function odd cards, and the clever scoring system.  Luck of draw is not critical in this game.  Players can do best of their cards with high or low cards.  Very good.

The card illustration is stunning.  This is an excellent job for a small publisher!  The game is very worth of its price.

= Short games, this can be a good introduction trick-taking games for newbie.

I was really impressed by this one.  A two-player trick-taking game with only three suits, special powers and funky scoring... my initial impression during the rules explanation wasn't that high.  But, over the course of the first play, it really blossomed.  I think what I really appreciate about it is that you can take a shitty hand and actually play it into a hand of strength.  It's a really impressive design.  Nice cards, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Note that this can easily be played with a standard deck of cards. You'll just need a reference for the six different special abilities and a reference for how scoring works.

First play impression: as a big fan of trick-taking games, this one seems good. I only know of one other trick-taking game that works well with two players (Haggis) so this fits nicely into that niche. This game has two things that make it work with two: the scoring system and the special abilities.

The scoring is really smart. You get the most points if you take very few tricks or if you take most of the tricks, but you don't get any points if you take all of the tricks. This helps to mitigate bad hands and it encourages you to try to take a certain number of tricks while also sticking your opponent with a number of tricks that is unfavorable to them.

The six abilities are simple but they allow for some strategic play. The ability on the 1's, for example, will let you lead the next trick if you lose the current trick. Another ability lets you change the trump suit. Using these abilities, and playing around the possibility that your opponent can use those abilities, is key to ensuring you win the right number of tricks.

I'll need to play some more, but as a fan of the genre I can already see this being a keeper.

Two-player only trick taking game on the lighter side. The artwork is beautiful and dreamy which suits the game well as it's one of the friendlier trick takers. To make it work with two players all the odd-numbered cards have special abilities where some are definitely stronger than others. You get points from either taking very few tricks or many - but fewest if you take all or almost all.

Continuously surprised that a two player trick taking game works. Makes you feel clever on your ability to manipulate your opening hand.

Designer basically took the most basic version of Whist and by adding special abilities on the odd number cards added elements of Hearts to the mix.  By doing this it created a mix of strategies.

Lots of talk about this being the best trick taking game for 2 players. I agree it's good, and perhaps very good if you count the fact that trick taking games usually don't work well with 2p. However, I still strongly prefer Triumvirate which I think is deeper.  I'm not sure if it's technically a trick taker, but I also really liked the Poker based Hocus which is also deeper than Fox and sadly under rated and under appreciated.   For me Fox is in the top three for 2p trick taking games.  While I appreciate what it does and does well, I don't think it's the best of its type and it's a bit odd that it would receive so much attention compared to those other 2 games.  At this moment Fox has a higher geek rating than both and to that I strongly disagree.  This is the lighter game and, I would argue, is the more repetitious of the three.

Very fun trick taking game, don't feel like you're losing anything going to only 2 players, it's almost more tactical.

I played this at a gaming store. I thought it was okay but it didn't seem all that unique. I didn't feel the story/plot line had much to do with the actual game. Artwork is nice. It was okay, but I don't see myself playing this again. They did say that most of the people playing it liked it a lot. So it might just be me.

Trick-taking games for two-players are virtually unheard of and quite frankly, seem like they wouldn't work anyway. This one does, mostly due to the clever scoring system. There are some fun little card abilities to manipulate trump as well, which also lends a bit of game space that appeals to the TCG/LCG crowd. Well worth picking up if you have any interest at all in the genre.

Really clever trick tacking game with some twists. It doesn’t beat Haggis, of course ;)

This is an extremely clever two player trick taking game. The trick taking itself is very straight forward with suit following and trump cards working very much like I am used to from more traditional games, but needing to either take many... but not all... of the tricks or try to take next to no tricks is a neat balancing act and its fun seeing a way to a great hand and using the special powers on the cards to make it happen.  A must try for any fan of trick taking!

Gyönyörű, elegáns, gyors, egyszerű ütés-vivős kártyajáték. 33 számozott lap, melyből fejenként 13 kerül kiosztásra és lesz egy adu is. Színre színt kell rakni, a nagyobb számmal tudunk ütni és persze van egy pár módosító is, ami megkavarja kicsit a játékmenetet. Kifejezetten tetszik.

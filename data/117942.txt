I prefer the original Zooloretto over this dice game, but still I rate both the same.

The one simple rule that you can refill a wagon that has just been emptied takes quite a lot off from the decision making. You cannot force other players to take bad options provided there are still unrolled dice. Hence, most of the time you are just optimizing your own game instead of thinking of the point swings between players.

After about 20 games played on Yucata, I'm amazed how much I like this game and how well it holds up for being "just a dice game".  I don't like dice games, and I don't like simple silly games.  Doesn't matter, Zooloretto Wurfelspiel is a good game.  Surprisingly deep strategy - I still can't figure out if taking a Crocodile on turn 1 is a good move or a bad one.

Will be watching for an English physical version.

Very enjoyable, a nice version of the endless Coloretto-Zooloreto family.  Throwing dice is always good fun.  The game preserves the original idea of making groups or taking them for you collection.  It plays fast, and it is certainly enterteining.  Dice seem to be good quality, and there is a booklet with scoring sheets for quite a few games.  Worth having.

This game follows the same idea of the other "retto" games like Coloretto and Zooloretto. Each turn you either add stuff for availability or take stuff. Once you take stuff, you are done with the round. Keep doing this until somebody gets enough animals in their zoo. The scoring in this version is super simple and seems to reduce how interesting the choices are in the game. I played it 3 player once and 2 player twice. Two is probably is the worst number of people for the game. I've seen enough to know that I don't need this game.

Played in www.yucata.de

Fun little game, feels a bit like Coloretto (the only I have played in the series). Probably better with more than 2 players because there is more competition for being the first to complete the different sets of animals.

*update*

After more plays at yucata, I love this game! it feels like Coloretto, I guess Zoloretto too but I have never played it, but at the same time it has a different touch, enough to justify owning both.

This is probably the best dice version of a boardgame I have played to date.

RATING: 5.5
It is true that this gives you more interesting choices than most dice games: you want to set yourself up to take animals that won't further harm your score while forcing your opponent into bad situations. You can split animals up to try to convince or dissuade someone from taking them, or you can stack them together to make them more or less tempting depending on what others have in their own zoos. It is important to keep an eye on your opponents' sheets, so the player interaction is pretty high. Great, right?

Well, sort of. Unfortunately, this does not have the elements I am looking for in a dice game. If I want to strategize and plan actions on my turn, setting myself up for success while making things difficult for my opponents, I will play a Euro or other strategy game. For a dice game, I want push-your-luck, wacky, yelling, laughing fun. When the entire game is predicated on randomness, I don't want a game that pretends to be strategic.

The luck is starting to come through in this one. Every dice game has luck but this one doesn't have much decision making. Players choose a cart, and that's your turn. If playing with more than 2 it can be frustrating because your opponents could give the other what they need. Good game to play with the kids but not with adults.

Made 3 homemade versions. Zoo/Farm and Hunter.
Light filler that encapsulates coloretto`s game
mechanic in a nice easy way. Two simple choices
take a truck with animals or roll two dice. Fun
and fast filler that is easy to explain. The dice
used are from 2 sets of Farm yatzy and 2 sets of
Zoo yatzy. Can therefore engage 8 players total
on two different games. Will try them out at the
next family game night.

RATING: 6
It's nice to see someone trying to innovate a venerable classic like Zooloretto (which itself was based off the superior Coloretto).  The components look nice, and it's incredibly fast to play.

Unfortunately I think this version loses a lot of the original game's spirit.  While the truck-taking mechanism remains intact, you've lost the opportunity to purchase and sell animals with other zoos, and that crucial decision about whether or not to expand your zoo.

So it's a perfectly fine diversion, especially if you have kids or just need a fast filler.  But I don't see a need to own this game.

Does a good job of distilling the original's game load/take truck of animals mechanic. Not that Zooloretto was very deep, and is mostly played for the light fun flavor, Zooloretto Dice is even simpler and somewhat boring. Once you get past the cute animal dice, you realise you playing a simple play the odds Yahtzee type game that suffers from repetition without much push-your-luck excitement.

I played Zooloretto and thought it was needlessly long and fiddly. This seemed to keep the essential mechanisms and get rid of all the rest. I finally picked up Coloretto, which I probably like better but hasn't replaced Zooloretto dice. With its cute, colorful animals, people are usually immediately interested. Gameplay even my 6-year-old could understand! Perfect train and plane fare! So it stays in my collection for now.

[floatright][size=5]2013-07-26[/size][/floatright]A small and fast game for 2 to 4 players dense with decisions.

Randomness both helps and hinders Zooloretto: it helps avoiding analysis paralysis, makes it harder to evaluate what is the best move and can decide the game when both players have filled most of their personal board. Adding a second and alternative endgame trigger might help alleviate the luck factor during the endgame.

[floatright][size=5]2014-06-16[/size][/floatright]During their turn players can roll dice and add them to the available trucks or take one of the trucks with everything it contains; the animals are then transferred to the player's zoo.
The players have room for 1 lizard, 2 ostriches, 3 monkeys, 4 elephants and 5 lions, the first player to reach these numbers (ex.: 5 lions) gets a bonus and players acquiring more than that (ex.: 2 lizards) get a 2 point penalty.
The animals you need more of, lions and elephants, are the best along with coins, which let you avoid getting penalized for having too many animals of a kind. The game ends at the end of the turn in which a player completes 4 of the animals' sets.

The bonuses aren't always worth it, as taking another animal of that kind will cause the player to receive a penalty.
For example, I prefer to get the lizards' bonus rather than the ostrichs' one, as this lets me to put more pressure on the first player: I can gather 1 ostrich twice before risking getting penalties, while he can only get 1 lizard.

The game is quite solid and can be very cutthroat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This makes a simple game even simpler, and a little more random.  Each turn, dice are rolled and placed on a small central board depicting up to 4 trucks that have room for 3 dice each.  Just like in Zooloretto, each player either places animals (by rolling dice and placing them in this version) or takes all of the animals already on a truck.  There are just 5 animal types, and players use a pencil with the provided scoresheets to mark off animals they collect.  The first person to fill a pen with animals of a given type gets an extra bonus, and any coins collected can be used either to negate the effects of collecting too many of one kind of animal, or for extra bonus points.  It's a good game to play with young children in a gamer family, and it plays a little quicker than the original game, but there's no other reason to own it if you have the original.

This works just fine! It uses the same -Loretto mechanic which I've loved in anything that I've tried it in. That being said, the Dice Game version isn't too much different than the card game. Almost like a variant, but with dice. A quick game that is nice and portable and does it a bit differently. Even with it being more of a variant than an entirely new game concept, there is lots of thought going into each turn - planning where to place dice and how to score for things and what not. You have to keep an eye on your opponents as well so it doesn't feel like complete MPS. Don't think I would need to own this one, but I'm glad I know somebody who has it!

Dull. Boring. Uninspired. As every take on Zooloretto. No matter what you do or how you play you end up having almost the same number of points as every other player. Some would say it's good balancing. I'd say it's dull. Because if it doesn't matter how I play, why bother and play it at all.

There's simply no tension and no emotions to this.

Simple dice set making game that surprised me with the strategy involved to win.  Fast play time, colorful wooden dice with a zoo theme that will appeal to younger gamers as well as adults.  

We laminated some of the score sheets so no danger of running out, plus it makes this a number one travel or camping game.

I like Zooloretto but I found this version of the game totally uninteresting and quite boring. It was over too fast and it seemed as if the few decisions I had to make were pretty obvious.  Coloretto is still the best of the bunch and thankfully the only one I own.

I love that the dice version of Zooloretto takes the part of the original game that I found most enjoyable and makes it the star of the show.

Unfortunately, not every game is that interesting. Some games are very tense but some aren't - I blame that on luck of the dice.

Get Coloretto instead.

When compared to Zooloretto, I don't believe the dice game can stand up to the enjoyment I had with its predecessor.  However, on its own merits, it makes for a fun, little dice game.  There's truly only a couple of actions on each turn and yet, there always seems to be a feeling of being on the edge, hoping you either roll what you need or grab trucks that don't hurt you.  Fun game!

A pretty good dice-based abstraction of the Coloretto/Zooloretto system that strips away a lot of the extraneous elements from Zooloretto. I don't think there's enough depth here to ever make this a favorite, but it's a fun enough quick filler that I don't mind having it around.

This is an excellent 2p filler. It is also, truly, a filler: you can play a game in under 10 minutes, including setup and takedown, and it is portable. The game has a lot of interesting decisions for something so simple.

However, I'm not as fond of this with 3-4p. The decisions aren't as interesting since you have to wait longer before it comes back to you. 

It is a good family game. My 6YO took to this right away and he's at the age where we've have good success with Kids of Carcassonne, Hey That's My Fish, and Yahtzee but nothing more complicated than that.

Brilliant little dice game.  Rated an 8 based upon the 2 player game.  Grew quite fond of this one on Yucata.de where I pretty much won all the time hence it cannot be THAT random.  It certainly will seem that way at first but anyone that's played an 'oloretto' game before should have a good start at understanding how the strategies might work.  It's my favoriate 'oloretto' game because it's far deeper and more interesting than Coloretto without having all the extra stuff to bog it down that the full sized boardgame versions have.  It's also a way way different game with 2 players vs. 4 so keep that in mind when reading my opinion or others.

A strange history -- a clever little filler card game named Coloretto gets a big is treatment with some extra bits and rules and wins the Spiel des Jahres.  It has a number of little and big expansions and eventually spins off a filler dice game that essentially returns it to the card game it originally was in the first place. Bizarre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A portable, quick-playing approximation of its popular namesake that keeps the feel but lacks the punch of the original. (Later expansions seem to remedy that and further fill out game play.) Overproduced, glossy score pads are attractive but would have worked better using plain paper. I'd rather play Schacht's Coloretto for a similar feel but better experience.

I love Zooloretto, Aquaretto, and Coloretto and I tend to really enjoy dice games, so I was eager to get my hands on this one.  I'm mainly played it with 3 players (once with 2 and once with 4) and for three or 4 I think it works great.  I didn't like it with 2 -- since you only get to roll 6 dice overall each round just felt very samey (roll, roll, roll, take, take).  With 3 or 4 players things feel much more tense as you really need to weigh taking a truck vs. rolling the dice and possibly helping other players more than you.  Great little game overall, especially if you like the others in the series.  Unfortunately, until an official US release, tracking down a German copy can be a bit tricky and possibly more expensive than it's worth.

I just love this type of game: easy to learn (and teach others), addicting and with many interesting decisions packed in a typical 15-minutes game. 
The theme is cute and well integrated and there is a very good chance that even your non-gaming mom/girlfriend/etc. is going to fall in love with this game.
Don't be fooled into thinking the game is all luck - I seem to be winning most of our family games so there is definitely fair amount of skill in the game and even the seemingly simple decisions can be crucial for your final score.
Equally great with 2, 3 or 4 players. I personally prefer it with 2 because there is the least amount of luck. Also I suggest playing two games in a row, because whoever rolls first in the 2-player game seems to be at a very slight disadvantage.

P.S. My family still enjoys it very much, even after being trashed so many times. The game just has that addicting, "let's play one more" factor.

P.P.S. You get nice looking scoresheets with the game. Before you run out of them I suggest you laminate 4 of them so you can write down your scores with the erasable marker and then simply wipe it off with the kitchen rolls. It should last you forever.

This does a pretty good job of replicating what the card and board versions of the franchise offer at their core.

Playing in 10-15 minutes some will like what it offers in that time frame whilst others will prefer the extra element or two that the board game offers at the expense of the extra 30 minutes.

For me this is a decent dice game but given the glut in this genre now I don't think it is a keeper for me.

In this dice version of the board game, the dice depict 5 different animals and a gold coin.  Each turn, a player rolls two dice, assigns animals to a truck iwth capacity of three, or takes a truck with animals. Each animal is worth a point, but players who fill their stables quickest get a bonus point. However, if you take another animal when your stable is full, then you lose two points. Coins, when used in a group can be used to cancel out the two point loss.

There is some luck, and it depends on what your opponents are trying to do as well. There might be more strategy with 2-3 players. It's fun to play as a filler.

Very simple game with no learning time. In spite of its simplicity, it presents you with some nice decisions for their relative short playing time.  

It starts with a nice idea that unfortunately, doesn't play out great for 2 players: the starting player has a big disadvantage, because his opponent gets to choose first, and at the beginning they both have the same interests.

By the time they have some animals and their interests have diversified, the tides might have changed and the starting player may not go first anymore.

I might increase my rating once I play more 3-4 players games.

I don't like the rules about Truck available again, remove a lot from the tension/nastiness of Coloretto, and except for 2 players game, I enjoy by far Coloretto. What the point of such a game except from a selling perspective? I would prefer in that case a retheming of "Zooloretto, the card game". Repetitive gameplay, plus a scoring nice to everybody = a game that make me sad of what the hobby has to propose.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Short, entertaining and certainly effective port to a dice game of the basic idea behind Coloretto: building three sets with different values that have to be collected by players, gathering positive or negative scores for the values included in them. This new twist keeps the charming topic of animals that was added when the original Coloretto was developed into Zooloretto, its feel being closer to the latter as well due to the penalties for getting more animals than your stable can allow. 

Even though the plays are lighter, quicker and probably more addictive than either of its ancestors, Zooloretto - The Dice Game has got two little drawbacks. The first one is that due to the use of dice the odds for animals coming up don't even out during the game (something that certainly would enhance its tactical value); the second drawback is that the penalty for an excessive amount of animals is only paid once, making the game more forgiving and therefore less exciting.

[b]Zooloretto: The Dice Game[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Three years later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I picked this up for my daughter at Total Con and I have actually come to enjoy the game more now than when I first picked it up. This is definitely a direct result of my having picked up Zooloretto over the summer and playing that. I thought Zooloretto dragged on for what it was and the dice version condensed the game down to my favorite part - loading and taking trucks. Zooloretto dice packs in all the tension/push your luck of deciding when to chance rolling the dice again versus taking a truck that will help you and packs it into a quick playing dice filler. 

Now that my youngest daughter is seven I decided to get another copy of Zooloretto Dice to play with her. She loves it, the theme won her over right away and now my older daughter is also having fun playing again. I also added the [thing=229451]new scoresheets[/thing] which has added to the replayability since each of the three scorepads introduces new rules/scoring conditions. I definitely would recommend them if you are a fan of the Zooloretto Dice. 

[i]]We've played a lot of the games in the Zooloretto family and I would currently rank them as follows:[ Coloretto -> Zooloretto Dice -> Zooloretto Junior ->  Zooloretto -> Aquaretto. (We own the first three and traded away Zooloretto and we use some of the Aquaretto animals in our copy of Zooloretto Junior).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- My daughter loves it, especially the theme.
- The dice are beautiful (really nice animal silhouettes engraved into the wooden dice).
- The score sheets are in full color with some nice art. This helps get the theme across.
- Quick, fun family game that younger children could easily play.
- However; there is some strategy involved with placing dice in the trucks and deciding when to stop rolling and pick animals.
- This is a very well designed, light filler game.

I highly recommend this game for kids, it is a game they could easily teach to their friends and play on their own. After owning/playing Zooloretto I would rather play this version and traded away my copy of Zooloretto.[/i]

RATING: N/A
As a new dice version of Zooloretto, I think it is just ok. I will say the components are top quality. But it is not a super clever or engaging game. It feels like a game where you roll the dice to see what you get and then the game is very shortly over. I think it probably best shines for kids to play and I will play it on occasion. I do prefer other dice games to this one (i.e. Wurfel Bohnanza and Qwixx).

A cute and simple dice game where you roll dice with animal symbols and like the Zooloretto board game (or Coloretto) you place them in sets and then you can select a set instead of rolling the dice. But as you collect animals you don't want to go over the zoo's allotment so you may get stuck with some animals you don't want. Enjoyable and could be great for younger gamers as there is some strategy but it is quite visible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and fast dice filler.  Players keep track of their results (collected animals) on individual score sheets.  Very portable and nice art.  Very similar to the set collecting mechanic in Coloretto.  Players, on their, can either roll 2 dice and allocate them to empty spaces on trucks or they can claim all the dice on a truck.  I like how every roll has a potential effect on every player so players stay involved the entire time. Component wise, the dice are too light.  I have wooden dice in other games that are denser and have more weight.

We call it "Zoo Dice," and it's a perfectly OK game featuring the *etto "I cut, you choose" mechanism; since I like that mechanism a lot, I get some enjoyment from Zoo Dice. 

This is going to invariably be compared to Coloretto, so I'll move straight to that: this isn't nearly as good as Coloretto, and it's missing a spark. There's not much more to say about it. It's pleasant. You roll dice, you try and collect good stuff by pushing your luck while your opponent(s) might try to clog up the works with junk, you do the same to them, and then you do it again until the game is over.

Por vários motivos não consigo ser apreciador desta recauchutagem da própria recauchutagem de Michael Stracht. Tudo começou com Coloretto, um jogo simples, bonito e com um pioneiro processo de escolhas; passou depois por Zooloretto, mais temático e palpável; agora chega a versão dados, que nada acrescenta e que, apesar de jogável, não dá qualquer prazer fazê-lo; digamos que depois de enriquecer o jogo com a primeira transformação, agora empobrece-o com uma terrível aproximação ao Yahtzee, que nem sequer se pode dizer que seja para o tornar portátil, pois haverá mais portátil que Coloretto?! Dispensável na sua plenitude!

Zooloretto: The Dice game is a short, funny and surprisingly tactical filler that plays under 10 minutes with two players. A lot of game under a very simple rule set.

I'll have to see how it holds up after more plays and how it works with different number of players.

edit. Probably best with three players but the 2-player game is still very nice. 4-player game is not really worth the time.
edit. Holding up really nicely. One of the best short&simple dice fillers.

Not too many surprises with this if you already know the Coloretto system.  I don't think it's as good as Coloretto, but it translates into a dice game pretty well.  Light, fast-playing game.

Az alapjáték nagyszerű adaptációja. Az állatoktól eltekintve egy egyszerű kockadobálós, kiválasztós mechanikával állunk szemben. Mégis (vagy éppen ezért) az ember szívesen játszik mindig egy újabb karikát vele. Az egyszerűsége, rövidsége és kis helyigénye miatt szívesebben ülök le mellé, mint a nagy dobozos játék mellé.

Simple little Zooloretto dice variant that captures the game really well in a short game. It's the same place or pick mechanic, but in this case the six sides of the die have five animals and a coin. Your zoo wants more of some animals than others and if you're first to fill the enclosure you get a bonus point. If you acquire an excess in an animal type then you lose points. Coins offset points losses, or are positive if unused.

It all works very well. There's absolutely no need to own this if you have the original game and you have four times as much time to play the game. If you're looking for something shorter, with the same feel, but a little less depth, then this is a good little small box game.

Zooloretto: The Dice Game does an excellent job of distilling the game play and feel of the original Zooloretto game into a quick-playing game using dice.  I'm very impressed with this streamlined design.  It's easy to teach and fun to play.  Although I do really enjoy the full Zooloretto game as well, this game is great to pull out with new/casual/family/non-gamer players as well as when there just isn't time to play a full game of Zooloretto.  I highly recommend this game!

You could probably get all the Zooloretto you need with this DICE game and the COLORETTO card game.  Pretty slick.  I wish the dice game had the capacity and scalability to add more players.  Maybe if I buy two sets I could play up to 6 without breaking the game.  But the economy changes quickly in that case, so I dunno.

It feels much like the full game, but lighter and MUCH faster, with dice. Maybe -- I haven't actually played the original game (not even on my iPhone) in quite some time. But it is a nice little filler I wouldn't mind playing from time to time. Again, though, it's not one I need to buy ... but maybe a little trade would be in order?!

--- Summary ---
Players each have a score sheet showing 5 pens (one each with 1-5 checkboxes, for alligators, ostrich, monkeys, elephants, and lions), a coin area (with 6, checkboxes grouped 3-2-1), and a barn area with one checkbox per animal type. There are 2n d6 in the game (showing each animal, and a coin face), as well as 3 (or 4 in 4-er) trucks, each with space for 3 dice.

On your turn, either roll 2d6 and add them to 1 or 2 of the available trucks OR take a truck and sit out the rest of the round. When you take dice, check one of the boxes in the appropriate pen. If you're the first to completely fill your pen for a particular pen, also score the bonus 1 or 2 VP (checkbox); if your pen is full, mark the matching checkbox in the barn, worth -2VP (if already checked, no further penalty). 

The game ends at the end of the round when a player has only one or zero remaining unfilled pens. Score 1 VP per animal in a pen (and per coin?), plus any applicable bonuses, minus any barn penalties. Each group of coin boxes either scores 1VP or lets you ignore one barn penalty. Most VP wins (tiebreaker = number of coins).

It is better and a bit trickier than it may seem at first, yet, it cannot get out of the "filler-zone", maybe that is okay if that's what you are looking for. A tad of screwing your opponent, a tad of choice making, a tad of cute, but never enough to get deeply engaged.
 Nice for 2 players, too.

This is a solid version of Zooloretto with a great 15 minute pure-filler play-time.  It captures the essence of Zooloretto in a way that is a bit more thematic than Coloretto, still plays in the time-span of the latter, and requires no shuffling.  It doesn't exactly replace Coloretto since the dice-rolling is more random than odds-figuring with card counting.  And it doesn't replace Zooloretto since it lacks the additional elements of the collecting the male and female animals to get the babies, and it doesn't have anything to spend the coins on except removing the animals from the stable.  But it really hits a sweet spot if you have 15 minutes and want to squeeze in another game.

It would be nice if you didn't open up a truck by taking the contents since that makes it easier for those who go after to rid themselves of bad dice rolls.  It was a nice bit of pain in Coloretto/Zooloretto that the row would disappear and you were sometimes forced to take a bad set if you stayed "in." 

This is going to fit into our filler game rotation of Sushizock and Scripts and Scribes, and is well worth the low price if you can find it.

[Abacusspiele 12 edition] {Zoo; dice-rolling, set-collection; scalable} This is a nice twist little game from Zooloretto.  It is fast and interactive.  It's a luck-fest game but players still can make meaningful decision in order to get more score or to sabotage other players.  It is a very enjoyable filler.

The colorful score sheet is nice but I prefer black & white paper.

RATING: 6
Only tried 2-player. Two plays, both 1-point difference in the scores. Having trucks become free for re-use feels wrong - maybe its just a presumption from prior Coloretto / Zooloretto versions, but it seems to make it too easy for the last player to avoid getting stuck with nasty choices.

A very quick dice game that actually has a bunch of choices.  There's lots of little choices that come together to make a difference.  I like how you can spoil trucks for other players.  The one thing I'm not sure of is how the trucks are opened up once the dice are taken.  I think that makes it too easy for the last player to roll the dice and get out of a bad roll.  In Coloretto, you lose the card rows as they're taken so I think I'll try this game with that rule.

tl;dr: fine

This game applies dice to the classic Coloretto mechanism. And it's very basic. Place dice with animals on trucks or grab trucks. Score points for grabbing animals, unless you take too many of the same kind, then you score negative points.
It's simple and effective, but in this day and age where we are flooded with dice games where you cross off things on a score sheet, this one is not one of the best. It's fine.

Popped out two rounds of this (using each side of the score sheet). It's a very light dice game, lighter than Ra the Dice Game which we really like, but still has some strategic competitiveness (we played with two). Could also see playing this when our kid is older. Components a very nice.

A really fun dice filler, with most of Zooloretto crammed into the box. Animals come pre-assigned to set-sized pens, so everyone values them the same initially, but it doesn't take very long before the tiny number of available dice are being tossed around for maximum inconvenience. It's also nicely short.

A very light dice game that takes just a few minutes to teach and play. The components are few, but nicely made. It feels like the boiled-down essence of Zooloretto (which I guess is the idea), which some will not be interested in, but I think makes for a cute diversion. I usually enjoy Michael Schacht's dice games.

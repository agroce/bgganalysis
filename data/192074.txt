Light 2-player game, like Lost Cities with some strategy.  The actions that set back the other player don't feel like "take that" and I like the artwork.

I can't pick any main reason why, but I really like this one.

got this as compensation from Osprey Games :-) for the crashed Odin's Raven Kickstarter project; 
the previouse Kickstarter run away with the money and never delivered the game :-( 
Very nice and good looking 2 player game, plays quickly for 2 or 3 games in a row.
This version is more streamlined compared to the original Kosmos version. For now I prefer the new version.

Elegant, simple 2p, a very unique racing game that once again brings to mind stuff like Candyland if it were created with actual decisions and tactics in mind. Choosing when and where to use those Loki cards is great, and the pieces and art in this new edition are wonderful. So glad I finally have a copy, just one of those timeless sorts of experiences that won't leave my collection. Thorsten Gimmler is two for two with me so far.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------------
A little disappointed by this one, although it wasn't a bad game.  Have never played the original, but this one felt like it was missing something that would make every game feel different.  There are a lot of land cards, but their order just isn't enough to make the game stay interesting.

2016-10-03 : The blurb says "completely redesigned" but I'd rather call it a variant - and not one of the better ones as the original game had a tiny bit more flexibility with the "magical way. After having played this and the two main versions of the original game I'm scratching my head as to why this game is so highly rated - it's a puzzle with a very limited decision space.

Very simple yet amazingly enjoyable game, Odin's Ravens pits two players against each other in a race across the world and back. Clever cardplay mixed with luck of the draw-elements combine for an intense and perfectly paced experience, complete with fantastic production values and just enough depth to keep it from becoming stale, even after multiple plays.

RATING: 6
Two player game, really simple to learn and plays fast. It's a tactical "race" game, meaning you're playing cards either to move, or to impede the other player. The decisions don't seem too complex, there are only minor calculations one must make when it comes to card order usage. Still, it's a pretty fun filler game that will get played, maybe 2-3+times in a sitting because of it's low play time and complexity. Plus, Osprey Games is pretty awesome for fulfilling the kickstarter, and the art/style is appealing.

RATING: 7
Probably one of the breezier and prettier 2p games I've played, and I really like it. Lower rating because I think I would get bored if I played much more. I don't like the Loki cards so much and I think that just says more about me than the quality of the game (I like more parallel abstracts for 2p, like DVONN and Hive). I think this game would get too repetitive after many plays though so I probably won't buy it.

Racing game, plays in about 15min. En este juego debes ayudar a un cuervo de Odin a llegar a la meta. El camino se construye al azar con cartas que representan diferentes tipos de paisajes. Los jugadores en cada turno hacen mover sus cuervos jugando cartas de paisaje. También hay que usar tácticamente las cartas de truco, cada uno tiene 8 y ninguna se puede usar dos veces.

Initial Rating: 3.0 (September 2016)

Once upon a  time, I played Odin’s Ravens but I don’t remember all the game´s nuances  (I will probably play it again before selling it) but I clearly remember I didn’t like the game. The caveat was that the friend who explained it wasn’t too sure about the rules so I decided to play Odin's Ravens (second edition) to see if I could like it. The short answer is an unequivocally NO!

I think Odin's Ravens (second edition) is a simpler and more streamlined version than its previous incarnation and in such a simple game, this is a good thing to have. I think they removed one part of the game (Magic Way?) making it easier and shorter to play (but I’m not 100% sure), still due to this removal, the game now has even more luck than before!

I love mythology but dislike racing games, however the theme here is very weak, so it doesn’t do anything for me.

Odin's Ravens (second edition) is a very simple game, thus, it is very easy to explain, you can do it under 5 minutes. Playtime is around 18 minutes (its best feature).

The game components are great, the art of the game is very well done (love the cover). The game´s components are very good as well and the insert is functional. I dislike the odd card size because it makes hard for me to sleeve the game, but I think even sleeved cards would fit into the insert. All things considered, Osprey Games did a terrific job in the production values department.

The game decisions are painfully obvious, you don’t have to think anything and luck of the draw is most important than anything else in the game. What bothers me the most is the uncontrollable luck of the draw, in our game both players played all their Loki cards but they affected a player much more than the other one and there wasn’t an adequate response to this situation. In general, when a game plays as fast as this one does, the luck doesn’t bother me, but in Odin's Ravens (second edition) case, it does bother me (and I’m not sure why).

Odin's Ravens (second edition) is definitively, NOT a game for me, I dislike almost all aspects of it. It is very light, it has obvious decisions, it has a very high luck factor. I had to rate it a 2.5, this is a bad game for me and I will do my best to stay away from it. When I play a game, I don’t want luck to have a big role in it, and luck determines almost everything in this game.

Every morning Odin sends his ravens, Huginn and Muninn, across the entire world to bring back news of what life is like on Earth. Naturally, after thousands of years, they've gotten a little competitive. Race through the landscape in opposite directions to be the first to return to Odin. Focus on speed, or enlist the help of the trickster god Loki to create shortcuts and hinder your opponent. Can you be certain Loki's changes won't help your opponent instead? There's only one way to find out!

I like the attempt to streamline and shorten the game.  I never like being forced to play the same game 3 times in a row.  I'd rather decide to play it 3 times because it is so fun.

RATING: 7
Beautiful game with nice quality components.  

This is a very light game, but since it plays so quickly (~15 mins) it won't overstay its welcome.  Perfect game to play while relaxing/talking with your opponent.  There's a little bit of 'take that', but not enough that it needs your full attention.

Since this is a hand management game, you have a few things to consider while playing:
-What does the landscape consist of at the beginning of the game and how best can you use the cards in your deck to quickly progress along the path.  Keep in mind, you'll see every card at least once and maybe half of them you'll see a 2nd time.  You can mitigate some of the luck, if you pay attention to which cards are more essential for traveling along the path.
-You only have 8 Loki cards to use for the whole game.  How can you use these cards to make your path easier and your opponent's path tougher.  Timing becomes important.

It's definitely a game where you're making small decisions each turn, but over the course of the game, a few of these become big decisions that shape your odds of winning.  There's some luck that will help keep things close.  Overall, for the price and play time, I definitely recommend this (especially for couples).

The pieces are great, the cards have a wonderful look to them, the box is great, so...I am glad I have a copy in my collection and I will keep it there.

01/04/17 Received.
02/11/17 Played two games. 
In the last 15 years I've been coerced  to play *many* race games (car, horse, balloon, boat, etc.) and have disliked them all. So why did I buy Odin's Ravens? The theme drew me in. Though  I admit its troweled on rather thinly.  The game's artwork is very nice. Though I think the two reddish terrain types (river? and valley?) look too much alike at first glance.  Luck of the draw is a big factor. But since its just a 20-30 minute filler I'll let that mostly slide. The rules could have used some more examples. As is they've generated quite a few questions on BGG with no obvious answers. Luckily the publisher has been on hand to set things straight for almost all of them.

Very nice filler that I enjoy more than the original; it's now a more streamlined racing game now and the more fiddly mechanics (particularly the "Magic Way") have been removed.  It's one long race now with hand management being key; while some may miss the Auxiliary Deck from the old version, properly managing your hand (as number of cards in hand is a tie-breaker) gives me a similar feeling to that.  The focus is now on winning the race as opposed to gathering victory points...

Love this game. Simple fun, nice race mechanics. Simple choices to make, with the trickster cards getting increasingly more tactical use as my wife and I understand how to play more and more. Proving to be a real winner for quick 20 min gaming opportunities.

Fun, quick game. Very easy to learn/teach. Game almost feels too short at times though which takes a way from long-term strategizing

KS Early Raven - KS failed to produce game. KS creator disappeared with money and did not produce game in 2 year timespan that he was under contract. Osprey Games bought contract and Osprey honored the original KS backer purchases by only charging shipping.

Nice art, but I have two gripes with this game.

First off, it is a racing game. Usually not my cup of tea, as they are usually too lightweight and repetitive.
Second, this is a lightweight race game.

Together, this kills any interest I'd have in this game.

The production quality here is great, and props to Osprey Games for picking this one up after the original Kickstarter crew fell through on their promises. Still, it's a very light and random game. It mostly resembles a roll-and-move with some extra control added in your ability to draw, and some twists in the form of Loki cards which you can use to try to hold back someone with a head start.

I suppose that's to be expected of a filler -- it's definitely an uncomplicated two-player game you can use to stall for time. Still, I don't see myself returning to this game very often.

RATING: 4
Great components and artwork. Heck, even the box is well-made. The game, however, is boring. It's a straightforward race with a touch of interaction, but overall lacking in excitement or tension until the final few turns. There just not enough here. Perhaps with a younger or more family-oriented crowd it would shine.

RATING: 7
This works really well as a couple's game. It looks nice, plays in about 15 minutes, and even the "mean" actions aren't too mean.

The game is highly random because of the cards and it feels like no matter how you play, players will be close or tied at the end of most games. These could be negatives if you're looking for a strategic game, but taking it as a light couple's game I consider those positives.

Not a bad little game for a two-player filler.

We used “Player with most Loki cards left” as it means they didn’t need them as a crutch and were thus the better planner.

This is the type of game that got me into German board games.  Easy to teach but with a skill level that isn't readily apparent when you first start playing.  Add into the fact, your strategy depends on the player your player against, this is the classic style of game I will never tire of playing.

Odin's Ravens is, without question, a relatively simple game, but I feel like it plays an integral role in our collection. After finishing a 1-2 hour game, Odin's Ravens is a great way to cap off an evening. My raven is typically neck and neck with my wife's, and we typically end the game within a couple of cards of each other. That, combined with the beautiful artwork and the theme (ca caw!), makes it one of my favorite lighter games.

As promised, an excellent, light game for two (played as a couples game). Rating may go up with repeat plays - it does what it's supposed to do. First play was quite smooth on a tired night. The super slick cards are pretty to look at but a slight pain to handle - hopefully with repeat use they'll gain some roughness for better grip.

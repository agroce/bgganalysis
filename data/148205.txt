While this game is mechanically an area control game, it really feels more like an auction game where workers are used to bid for certain tiles. But regardless of how you define this game, this game is about valuation and those that enjoy auction games may find a real gem here.

There are two things that really bring this game together. First and foremost, everything is open information and the game moves slow enough where players can plan ahead. This is not some tactical area-control game where the entire board changes before it gets around to you... this is one that allows/rewards for careful planning. Secondly, how tiles are valued/scored is wonderfully intriguing and brain-burning. It's not a simple case of higher value tiles are always better. Players want high-value tiles but they also want to place an exclusive story, which must have a lower value than the top story (exclusive story double in value). And on top of it, there is this spatial puzzle (you need to fit those tiles on your board), which makes certain tiles more valuable depending on the current situation. 

Overall, this game is simple, quick, and has a theme that really integrates well with the mechanics. So far, I'm impressed and can see this game becoming a classic.

PennyPress is a terribly unbalanced two player game. I haven't played with more players yet though.

RATING: 7
Much lighter than I expected.  Thought I bought a midweight strategy game, turns out to be super-fast and light.  Your options each turn are fairly limited, but the best choice is rarely clear - there are many different factors to consider in order to get the most points out of each reporter you place.  I like it...?  Due to its speed, it may have more of a filler/last-hour-left role rather than the meat and potatoes of my game night.

RATING: 6
Pretty good.

The tempo is odd, as it rewards going to press quickly while giving players the tools to prevent others from doing so. With enough intentional blocking, the game could drag quite a bit. There is nothing in the game to prevent a round from going as long as the players want.

The blind draw is a bummer. Maybe revealing the top card of the deck is the answer.

The reporter play in 3 players felt a bit degenerate. I think 4 players might be the game's sweet spot.

RATING: 8
Played it at PaxEast and had SO much fun. It's definitely a worker placement game, so if you don't like those, well, first, what's wrong with you but I guess if you really don't, then you may not love it. But this is such a good theme for a worker placement game. I love the newspaper theme and this works just so perfectly for it. I ADORE the tile fitting for the paper too.

At first, it seemed like there were so many components and rules to keep track of, but like so many good games, as soon as you started playing, it all just made sense. 

I can't WAIT for this game to come out. There is a chance my rating will go up to a 9- I just have to play it more to see how much I want to play it, but it really is super solid. Matt and Robert did a great job and I can't wait to pick it up.

This seems like a game I should enjoy, but my 1 play as a 2p game was not good. It seemed to be a race to go to press, and it was far too easy to rush that with back to back turns. May have to try a few tweaks to see if the experience can be adjusted.

I am a journalist and I love my job. I reckon myself as an analyst and not as a reporter, and I really admire the colleagues who manage to run all day, live with a phone attached to their ear and collect exciting news. It's something I cannot do in real life but I do it in Penny Press. The theme is like it was made for me, the artwork and the components are beautiful (especially for Asmadi) and the cover is one of the best looking I've ever seen. Certainly not innovative, but it combines great mechanisms and a theme that applies to a niche market in which I belong. Top ten material for me.

Not my type of game (based on one play). Very chess-like. In three player, we found ourselves in a loop: it was better for each of us to reposition on our turn, and wait for someone else to make a mistake (over and over and over) - we then decided that the 'Newsboy' variant shouldn't be a variant, but an integral part of the game. The graphics are beautiful - and if you like a 'game of inches' that's very confrontational (and area-control), I'm sure you would like this much better than I.

I have been doing some playtesting of this game for the designers.  (They are both good friends of mine)  I really have enjoyed playing the game and seeing it come thru the design process.  

It is a quick strategy game that plays in 45 minutes to a little over an hour.  The mechanics are easy to learn, but like most euro style games it has some deeper strategies that may not be apparent until you have played a few times.  I really like games that give some interesting decisions to make on your turn.  Penny Press has some excellent decisions and strategies for a lighter game.

A very surprising flop. This game had me quite excited, but that quickly evaporated after playing. The ideas at play are neat, but the gameplay was dreadful. I was convinced I had been taught the game incorrectly, but after reading the rulebook myself, I realized that this game just wasn't fun. The game feels much more like a race than a strategic area control game, and this limits my enjoyment of it greatly. Considering its triumph of Tabletop Deathmatch, this dislike was all the more surprising. But, the box art is one of my favorites.

(05/30/2015) Comment based on one play.

This initially looks like an interesting set of mechanics that conveys the feel capturing news stories and printing a newspaper, but game-wise boils down to a frustrating and disappointing pissing contest.

Each player has a tableau with a small grid on which to assemble a newspaper front-page, consisting of an abstract paste-up of a number of news "stories" counters which come in a variety of square or rectangular shapes and sizes. The stories come in a number of categories, such as war, crime, national, and sports. At the beginning of each round, a number of these stories are randomly generated and placed in a category column on the main board. Players then take turns assigning, reassigning, or removing a limited number of reporter meeples, in order to get greater than or equal to majority on a number of developing stories. The relative "newsworthiness" of a news piece goes up and down depending on the number of reporters covering the said story. At some point, a player will declare that they are publishing, taking all the news pieces that they have equal or majority number of reporters. The player then arranges the stories on their grid, attempting to satisfy certain criteria like placing the most significant piece at the top for the headline, while making sure all the pieces fit like a tetris puzzle. The player then scores points for arrangement and placement of the various pieces, while being penalized for empty spaces and poor placement. The stories that are printed are then saved to the side for end game scoring.

With this description, this seems like an interesting and engaging game of running a newspaper. The most interesting part is figuring out what stories to cover, not only based on their relative newsworthiness (based on how many reporters are on the counter), or the number of stars for end game scoring, but most immediately the shape of the newsprint, which comes in various shapes and sizes of squares and rectangles. If a player can put together the right shapes, they can fill in the front page and score many points. However, on the next page layout, the player must arrange stories around a randomly located advertisement that serves as an obstacle. Once a player has published three times the game is over. The players then evaluate how many stars they've collected in terms of published stories in the various categories and get end game bonus points for having the most, or second most in each category.

What is most disappointing is the micro-turns in-between the publishings. In turn order, players set out a number of reporter meeples on the various news pieces on the main board, attempting to gain the right to print the said piece. However, other players can place their own meeples on a given news piece, attempting to "scoop" the story. Although they may not have majority coverage, if they have at least one meeple on a piece, they get scoop points based on the relative newsworthiness even though it was published by another player. A player may attempt to put more meeples on a given piece, so that it cannot by published by others, especially if the category of the piece is important to a given player for end game scoring. However, that player must wait one turn after placement in order to publish. During that time, others can move meeples in on the piece and gain majority. The game then devolves to moving one or two meeples back and forth, attempting to gain majority while discouraging others. This can continue for several micro-turns until one player gets frustrated and publishes whatever pieces they can get, which tends to be suboptimal. If players are experienced, no single player would be allowed to collect and print an optimal set of news pieces. This then means a Mexican standoff for several turns, until someone makes a small mistake in meeple reassignment or someone simply gives up in frustration.

The game has interesting ideas and has so much potential, but it is the micro-turns that seems underdeveloped--since this was a Kickstarter design, this is no surprise. There is no way for the stalemate to be broken, unless it is done deliberately, which makes for unsatisfying play. There is an expansion, which has a giant newsboy meeple that moves around the board, supposedly breaking the deadlock, but even that on the surface seems like an unsatisfactory solution. If there were some other way to represent the coverage and interest in specific news stories, other than sequential placement of meeples (like hidden meeple placement), this would do away with the pissing contest phenomena and result in a far more enjoyable game. As it stands now, it is a "4", with room to go down, as I have no interest in trying this again.

In full disclosure, I'm personal friends with both designers. However, I still truly find this a very enjoyable game. As a worker placement game the newspaper theme works great and it contains some very important elements: 1) ease of play, 2) interesting mechanics, 3) short game time (40 or so minutes) and 4) enough tension in decision-making. It really won me over in that while easy to play, I didn't have an immediate sense of strategy. That will only come from repeated plays -- which I look forward to many.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (June 2015)

Penny Press was a regular experience for me. The rules are easy to explain (under 10 minutes) and the game can be played under 60 minutes. It has a light-medium weight. At first it seemed like a good game, it has a fresh theme (which I donât like nor dislike) and it features âArea Majority Controlâ (a mechanism I love) in the form of the reporters. However each turn it is obvious (most of the time) which news was the best for me (according to the shape, stars and topic) so I spent my whole turn trying to get it, but when my turn came again I no longer could publish because other players have already surpassed me. That is, we spent most of our time adding/reassigning reporters so no one could publish what he wanted. It gets old very quickly. When a player finally published it wasnât the best move. To clarify, I got bored because the game stalemated quickly and was very slow in this regard. Other than block other playerÂ´s moves I donât have much control over this. 

I also feel the game has obvious decisions.

The game components are very good.

Bottom line, Penny Press is a mediocre game for me, the timing issues around publishing makes it a boring game for me. I wonât buy it and I wonât pursue anymore plays of this, but if someone ask me I think I can play it once more with a variant.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I haven't gotten to play again, but the game was good enough that I still remember really enjoying my one play of it. I'll blame this one on the cult of the new getting in the way of replaying games I don't own.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I really need to play this again to speak intelligently about it. I really enjoyed my first play, but man did it fly by. I think the one thing you need to wrap your mind around while playing is that there are not fixed scoring rounds (going to press), you choose independently of everyone else when to go to press. 

That is the key to the game because you don't want to fall behind other players and potentially either lose out on going to press one time or having to go to press before you really set up your reporters.

I love the theme and art (nice job Asmadi) and the flavor text on all the cards is great as well. I am really looking forward to playing this game again![/i]

Absolutely horrible as a 2 player game (my main count for games).  I hate games that treat 2-player as an after thought and make up "alternate rules" for that count.

What I like: The mechanics are pretty simple and straightforward. It has a bit of a puzzle element to it and there is some good strategy and interesting decisions to be made. For that, I'd play it again. Now the rest: The theme is pretty weak. Reading the headlines when cards are draw is the closest you get to feeling like you're running a newspaper. The component quality is also meh: the art is drab and the player mats are flimsy. The mechanics also aren't very original but, as a whole, do work.
I would definitely play again, it's not a bad game, but I'm not excited to even want this in my collection.

RATING: 6
In this game, players aim to be the first to publish three editions of their small newspaper. To do this, you compete to be the first to grab stories that fit into your front page layout, and players are rewarded based on how 'hot' the type of story is. Despite this being primarily a race game, you are competing for points, and there are rewards when someone snatches a tile out from under your meeple. Good, although it's possible to fall behind though multiple players happening to block you more than they block other players.  In each play, as we got towards the end of the game, we always experienced what seemed like an odd shortage of story tiles available to compete for. We also would wind up with these strange leapfrog blocking moments, where players would sort of block each other back and forth until someone got bored and did something else.

Penny Press is a game of bidding workers in a way reminiscent of Keyflower (which I have not actually played) where you're trying to have your journalists on the big stories to take them to print, accumulating points, and hopefully ending up with the most whatever the hell the VP are called in this game. The physical size of the tiles is semirelevant to the mechanics, but the board is pretty damn big considering all it is are a few tracks.

The different tracks that grow in a way reminiscent of the art values in Modern Art don't grow very high or in any controllable way with three players, and we all sorta felt that to get the game to work better we'd have to play it differently, which shouldn't be something you figure out in this way. In a first play (or a first play with a particular count), you should still have a fun time even if you're sorta clunky and bouncing off the edges of the game because you don't fully get the game's flow.

Newspaper publishing during the William Randolf Hurst era.

It uses worker placement as a bidding system for news stories. The trade off is the stores with high current values versus those that may pay off better at the end of the game. There is a puzzle aspect since the stories are different sized and you must fit them to a layout on small grid, which represents presenting your front page
You go press 3 times in the game and later runs will have an advertisement on your board which your stories must work around.

Headline cards to determine which story categories will be available and the relative values, use actual period headlines which adds nice color to the game.

I played a prototype at the PAX East Unpub booth, and I enjoyed the experience quite a bit.

Mechanics: The mechanics of Penny Press are very solid. It's a short and approachable worker placement game with several cool tensions to keep in mind when making choices.  
-Do I want to try to publish story A for its current value, or story B for what it will be worth at the end of the game?  
-Do I want to spend my turn skimming some points off of my opponents' published stories, or do I spend my time setting up my own?  
-How many reporters do I need to send to the story?  Too few and my opponents could steal it, but too many and I'm wasting resources.
The game also has no exceptions, which I find elegant.

Theme: Penny Press's theme is tantalizing, and strangely enough perhaps too cool.  It even uses REAL HEADLINES from the period!  I really like the idea of being a newsroom head fabricating news stories at the turn of the century, but the game didn't always succeed in making me feel like I was doing that.  The tile placement mechanic of arranging stories on the front page totally works towards the narrative, but the way stories change value loses the theme, and took me out of my fantasy.  That said, I can see the story being bolstered by character art and the new cards that I got a preview of.

Conclusion: I'm looking forward to having a chance to play Penny Press again, and if I'm still interested after two or three more plays I'd like to add it to my collection!

I quite like this game, but my wife is not a fan of games that take things away from you, so it's got to go. She's basically been out-bid for a few stories (bidding with reporters, as it is) and had her plans shattered, and even though she remained competitive, it's put her off the game completely.

quick, interesting decisions, not sure how to 'win' and not sure if the way the tiles replenish randomly (and can drain a particular stack quickly, leading to few options in the late game) all works but it's tight and quick quick quick!

I love the idea of making a game about publiching newspapers and I'm glad they didn't go classic worker placement - that would have been the easy choice. 

The area control is fine and I like how you have to layout your front page but all in all the game is pretty abstracted from it's theme and the scoring is a mess, which makes an otherwise simple game convoluted.

In the end it doesn't really feel like a newspaper game and as an area control game it is surpassed by the pure experience in El Grande and the direct conflict of Mission: Red Planet.

RATING: 7
A solid short game with a number of interesting mechanics that mesh together in a pleasing fashion.  The balance between quick publishing and perfect tiling is interesting, as is the tempo between placing vs. moving workers.

update: the more I play this game, the less random and more strategic it feels.  I no longer feel like the game has too much kingmaking or luck; once the players get the hang of it, it is very tight.  The game works well with light play or serious play.

A solid game for multiple audiences.

The quick pace of the game and the short playing time make this a game I wouldn't mind playing if it were on offer, but I'm not going to be clamouring to get it to the table. Options are easy on your turn. Good decisions are harder. A player targeting you over others will screw up all your plans. The player left to their own devices the most will likely emerge the winner.

All in all it feels rather unsatisfying. I've given it a few shakes now and it's not getting any better. Some players are likely to enjoy it though.

RATING: 7
Interesting newspaper theme for a board game. 

This is basically an auction game where each player's 5 news reporter meeples are the currency used to bid on newspaper stories. The value of the story tiles is a function of a number of variables such as shape/size (to fit efficiently onto the front page of your paper), stars (potential end-game bonus points) and story category (the relative value of the different types of stories vary throughout the game). 

I am not sure that the game scales well, and more players seem to make for more interesting dynamics. The game plays relatively quickly and may thus be a good choice if time is limited.

Very interesting combination of different parts. There are some elements that score individually and others that score differently based what everyone has been doing. Winning depends on using the moves of others to improve your own progress. The theme fits in very well, both in the first-glance elements (arranging news stories on your front page) and in more subtly (if a particular topic is being hyped by a newspaper, other newspapers can ride the wave).

1 play, 2er

Light, quick-playing area majority game with a newspaper theme. Each turn you get only one action: place workers, recall workers, move ONE worker, or publish. When you publish, you claim any stories where you have the most reporters (or tied for most). Use these to lay out a front page and earn points depending on the popularity of the stories, filling the page (no empty spaces), etc. Game end is triggered when someone publishes thrice (or x 4 in 2-3er); then, everyone gets a final action, and then a final publish.

Seems like it would be fun, but much better with more players; also, perhaps a bit too light for my tastes?

Something a little different from most worker placement game. It plays quickly, yet requires some thought, do you challenge for the most valuable story(s), or go for a lessor story and be sure of getting points.  Unlike many worker placement game you you are never really locked out of a location/story.   Sweet.........

I like the idea here, but this game has some problems. The biggest issue seems to be that once somebody initiates a scoring round (I think the game term is "going to press"), the other players have to keep doing the same in order to keep up. This means that you can never spend time to position yourself the way you want. So the game typically starts with each player making a move or two, one player initiates scoring, then on every other turn, players initiate scoring. The game just doesn't have a good flow because of this.

Another thing, the game doesn't work for two players. I've seen people online try to defend the 2P game, but it just doesn't work. Like most area control games, you just need more competition to make it at all interesting.

I like this idea of area control without having any kind of combat, but the game just seems like it's missing a few elements.

Sold.

Newspaper magnates compete to grow the largest circulation in the Big Apple.  Worker placement and re-assignment of your reporters to get majority coverage of five types of news beats.  Break stories on your front page that you have reporter majority in a sub game puzzle to score points with a penalty for front page white space.  The value of the five news beats rises and falls with reader interest. A lot I like in this one; no reset & static game phase progression downtime just constant action between jockeying for lead coverage and going to print, I also love the chaos and unpredictability from reassigning reporters especially in a five player game, combined with arranging different sized story rectangles on your front page puzzle.

I thought it was OK. Game is way too quick. Its over before you even have a chance to do anything. 

It felt like commodity speculation behind the scenes with area control; although if you spend all your time dealing with commodity speculation and area control you'll never be able to go to press.

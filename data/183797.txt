Timeline fun for Star Wars fans. Episodes IV to VI.

This is much easier than the other timelines, with only the occasionally tricky bit for those that know the films moderately well.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy this, one to play with Star Wars fans though, as it's largely guess-work if you've not seen the Original Trilogy. One downside is the game provides a huge advantage for the player who goes first.

I have played other games in the timeline series and I do enjoy them but, this one is very strange, especially if you play with star wars fans, who will know most of the answers immediately.

I have seen the films on one or two occasions but I would not call myself a fan, and to be honest if you do not know the films inside out then this is very difficult, I mean you can infer things, such as the deathstar is blown up after we first see it, but generally you are blind guessing.

Other timeline games allow you to make educated guesses, but this is just trivia, which you either know or you dont

Components: ok components, good quality cards and lovely tin box
Complex: really easy, less than 5 mins to be epxlained
Weight: light/ familiar
Players: from 3
Length: really short
Opinion: 0,5 points more than standard Timeline for the them. It is as easy as you have several cards in front of you and you have to set them in chronological order in the table. Really good game to have some laughs or to be used to teach anything. In this case the them is Star Wars, so the latest can be ignored

Hilarious trash talking and competition when played with fans, great session of total guessing and luck when played by people who don't know the films, an utter riot with a combination of both. Totally unexpected, I groaned when someone brought it to the table. Ran out and bought myself a copy.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (December 2015)

I’m finally tiring of the whole Timeline series. I still have all the sets for the game, but my desire to play them is getting lower as time passes. The Star Wars set isn’t the exception. It is a nice to have set BUT I (and many friends) know the answer to 99% of the cards, so these games tend to be a lot longer. I’m not sure if rules were changed to avoid this issue but I don’t think so. 

Bottom line, I’m still undecided if I should keep it. It is weird (and perhaps unfair) when you know the answers to very card in the set. I will only play this with other Star Wars fans. People who didn’t watch the films are utterly lost (and bored). With other Timeline sets you can make an educated guess, here is pure trivia.  

Current Rating: 6.0

Put the cards depicting scenes from the original Star Wars trilogy into the right spots of the time line based on how it happened in the saga. Most are rather easy because they use major beats in the story that don't repeat in other films.

BIG PLUS: inexpensive, easy to learn
BIG MINUS: size of the cards, little challenge for fans
SUPER BIG MINUS: not available in North America due to license restrictions

Really, the only time it can get slightly challenging is where the movies have multiple parallel story threads and you can't be sure about how it was edited. And in those rare cases - who cares what the actual answer is?

Star Wars trivia for the visually inclined. When played with other SW-geeks it boils down to who makes the first mistake - but with the trash talk that's included with the SW-geeks I know, that's a big part of the fun

You'll know immediately if you'll enjoy playing this. It's Timeline but with scenes from the original Star Wars trilogy. You place them in the correct order. That's it. It's not educational the way the Timeline or Cardline games are. You just get to geek out for a while about how much you all know know about Star Wars. Since Star Wars is the only sci-fi gene I have, this works perfectly fine for me. I enjoy it. Not every week, but I enjoy it.

RATING: 4
A timeline game that you can only play with fans of Star Wars and then only with fans that know the films as well as you do. If one player knows them better than the others then they will always win so what is the point. If everyone playing is a fanatic then the game will never end - is there really an audience for this?

RATING: 7.9
If you like timeline and like Star wars than this game is great for you.  If you don't like Star wars then you will not like this.  As a Star Wars fan this was really enjoyable and a little harder than expected but still not too hard.  I would recommend for real Star Wars fans to start with 6 or more cards a piece.

I'm not big fan of Star Wars so I play quite randomly. For Inventions, Discoveries, Dinosaurs, you can guess even if you don't know. There, it's just geekness.

Do you know perfectly the movies or not ? If not, there is absolutely no interest. And even if you know, not sure of the big interest ...

I like this game. Games about old planes attract my attention and this game does not disappoint. L'aeropostale takes you back to the days of pioneering in the old days.
Seems like multiple strategies are possible. You could stay in Europe and still acquire enough points to win. But trying to reach Latin America is more fun I think.

The rules to this game were almost impossible to figure out.  It's possible that if I had learned it from someone who knew it, rather than from the rules, my rating may have been better.

has a very realistic feel in almost every part of the game.  The only anomaly was that it did not need a plane to achieve a world record speed or altitude etc   Strange??!!

L'Aéropostale covers approximately the same thematic space as Martin Wallace's Aeroplanes. Players take control of corporations in the fledgling aerospace industry, establishing the first flight routes and pushing the borders of the quickly reachable world out further and further.

L'Aéropostale is the more thematic game of the two, with more emphasis on stuff like world records, weather conditions and most especially fame and reputation. It comes with several scenarios that alter winning conditions and starting positions which is a nice touch as well. On the negative side, the thematic focus sometimes comes at the expense of a balanced game. Depending on the scenario the game can run very long (even the "short" scenarios aren't exactly short) and the luck factor is considerable. So while I like the underlying ideas better than what Wallace came up with in Aeroplanes, I feel like L'Aéropostale would have benefitted from some more development (which is also reflected by not so great rules) and thus unfortunately comes out as the loser.

Aviation theme = interest. Nonetheless, even before release my interest evaporated when I saw a picture of a player board that combined the Luft Hansa name with an iron cross. Thankfully, this saved me from getting a game I would have regretted buying. It’s a typical small publisher effort with many ideas but not enough development. To start with the positive, theme integration is strong. Early aviation was a risky business. You never knew if you reach the destination without incidents. You might discover worthless demands, get screwed in die rolls, kicked out of cities just because it’s you while another player gets lucky and gets all the fame. Too bad that this is integrated in half-baked Euro mechanisms and a far too long playing time for the amount of depth and randomness. The challenge is in mastering the number of game elements combined, not in the depth of decisions which filter down to focusing on fame or lots of destinations. It’s far too fiddly and clunky for my liking. A better alternative to this game is Wallace’s Aeroplanes.

I don't really know what this game is about. It's kind of... chaotic. Well, played only once, but have no intensions to play anymore. Nice graphic design.

First play:

Many options, little choices. It seemed to me that there where not so many meaningful choices from the many possible options. Mostly you lacked pilots, but if you took a new one he just got hired away by the next player.

This game deserves more love. The theme is very interesting, covering the golden age of aviation, and is rendered quite well in the game play.

It seems that there is a good game here. A game of majorities, of development and breaking records and upscaling your  operations with more pilots and more planes. And good interaction too. Rating is prelimenary and only based on a few rounds in Essen.

Good game, beautiful AND functionally good designed (which is a rare combination)

Enough interaction and theme, and I also like the ability to choose between shorter and longer scenarios.

I guess I should have picked this one up at Essen. I might have it their demotable had some free space...

Played one of the worst games of my career, but still see the good stuff in this game.  The group really liked it, and I need to play again to redeem myself, at least a little.  Functional board, with a lot of setup required.  We played a snort version; interessted to see what happens as play time increases.

Personally I found this an enjoyable "race" game with elements of area control & luck where timing unfortunately can be the major key to victory as everything is very much intertwined and a little unforgiving in combination with the cut throat nature of competitive play.

Brilliant theme too.

Would keep if there was more opportunity for it to hit the table (ie: some of my gaming group aren't so keen) ..

Gioco molto interessante e dagli ottimi materiali. La cosa che più mi è piaciuta del gioco è il tentativo di ambientazione e l'espansione verso il Sud America dei voli. Condizioni atmosferiche, meeting, record e piloti leggendari rendono il tutto molto simpatico. Meno chiare e immediate (anche un po' forzate) le due fasi di esplorazione e trasporto che permettono di posizionare cubetti 'presenza'. Molto carina invece l'idea di prevedere due valutazioni completamente differenti per decretare il vincitore. Gioco da provare qualche volta prima di bocciarlo come viene da molti fatto.

We played this last night and it looks lovely, but the rules are difficult to penetrate!  After 1.5 hours of setting up our group of 4 finally started playing and it just took ages to make anything happen.  

Frustratingly we played the intro scenario so the game finished too quickly.

We'll have another go on this next week, but in terms of initial impressions, that was a bad experience.

Richly thematic, beautifully produced game about the early age of aviation. The game is about making deliveries, and earning flying badges in a race to be the best pilot. 

There some nice touches and but it felt too long for its weight, but it was enjoyable. I decent game somewhere between super filler and light strategy game. Gorgeous to look at.

If you like worker management games where skill is the overriding element, this game is not for you.  While the complexities of managing and building a postal empire are intriguing, the randomness of rewards are so wild as to make the game easily swing for or against you.  The sad truth is that if rewards weren't random and could instead be chosen by the players, this game would actually be about 4 stars better.  The end game victory condition is also very random.  You spend most of the game fighting for 4 bronze, 3 gold, 2 platinum and 1 silver wings but if nobody achieves this then the winner is the person with the most routes (which isn't how you get wings).  On top of all this is that 70 minutes isn't anywhere close to realistic for a full length campaign.  For a more accurate estimate use 6 mins per player per round plus 2 mins for cleanup at the end of the round.  This would put the game at 192 mins for a full length campaign (which is about 45 mins shy of what it took us on our first play through with rules explanations).

In short, L'Aeropostale is a flawed game in which you can have no chance of winning 2 hours into a 3 hours game.

This has some interesting things going on in it, but the 1919–1929 scenario didn't convince me of the game's greatness.  I'd be willing to try other scenarios, but the first edition's rulebooks are… not good.

The original French is riddled with mistakes, some of which were corrected in the English rulebook (I haven't gotten to see the German yet); however, the English translation — well, there are a lot of things I would have translated differently.  An example of a term I would have translated differently:  The French rules use the word "meeting" (yes, the English word) to refer to an event that I would have called an "air show".  Needless to say, whoever or whatever translated the French to English used the word "meeting" that was there already.

I think there's an interesting game buried in these dodgy rules, but even so, it may not be a game for me.

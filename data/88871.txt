I did not try Road to Leningrad before this one.

Hmmmm... pretty much structured around the East Front Series with a lot of rules similarities and some differences, like the chit-pull system and choice of Assault, Mobile operations and CRT.

Unfortunately, I was seriously put-off by the gaming proposition. There are a lot of rules, exceptions, things to remember, a lot of details, steps, modifiers, cross-references... too much. I would have streamlined the whole thing considerably.

The strategies/tactics are quite obvious and I did not find that the options were satisfying, choosing whether to conduct an Assault or a Mobile operation is usually a no brainer.

Ergonomics are poor with considerable stacks with markers etc. Once I realized that most of my pieces were on the KG/BG holding boxes I wondered if the scale was right.

All in all I found that this was a lot of work for relatively little fun. If it had been simplified, somewhat cleaned up of unnecessary minutiae, it would perhaps be a keeper.

"Tactical guerilla" on Eastern Front. Game system, which portrays lower level echelons in combat. Clue of this system is to gain succesful odds in combining ground units, artillery and air. Formations chits gives uncertainty and creates chaos of combat situations. 
Nice crafted game and well developed, but too much micromanaging - constantly counter swapping from hex to hex may be boring and is fiddly. 
Average replay value. Main axis of advance are well known.
Luck factor is significant - d10 in combat resolution is IMO not so good with so spreaded CRT.

Another warfare listed as 1-2 players that is for 2 players. Unless you want to play both sides against yourself. Like a good game of chess....against yourself. No thank you. I will have to dig much deeper when I see 1-2 on a war game. I now know that is for 2 players or one person that wants a historic simulation.
More money lost on a non solo game...

Interesting topic and good design ideas, although it is sometimes fiddly (up to 6 die rolls for a combat !).

One more thoroughly researched battlefield developed into a boardgame. The contents are of fine quality; the trademark of GMT. The rules are extensive and detailed on every aspect of these engagements. They are so well presented and in such cohesion that there will be no need to go back and forth searching for that particular exception in the mechanics of play. For most part of the play the German has the initiative and the power to breakthrough Soviet lines; always finding gaps and opportunities. While the Soviet player is in defense there are always chances to counterattack and snatch Victory Points from his opponent. 

All factors and parameters have been taken in consideration to adapt the exact environment of that era in the wargame: weather, supply, air units, armor, artillery, strongpoints etc. For each factor there are comprehensive rules to be implemented. The game includes a couple of scenarios for each operational region (Mtsensk & Mozhaysk). The time frame for each scenario can reach up to 7 days of fighting and every game turn is almost half a day. The Combat Results Table has been designed to conform with this time scale and provides realistic outcomes. Do not expect to command large maneuvers. Although the blitzkrieg theory is put in practice at every opportunity the historical facts impede major achievements and encirclements due to bad weather, terrain and supply restrictions. 

The chit-pull system assures replayability and the type of operations chosen (Mobile or Assault) presents players the harsh reality of warfare. The game has grasped the real situation and historical factors of these military operations.

Way too fiddly game mechanics. Chit-pull system needs more tweaking. Russians are way too capable. Not enough fog of War. Both players know way too much.

Have only played the short scenarios but it captures all that is good about Roads to Leningrad, which I consider to be a top-notch, well-designed game. Just like RtL, lots of tough decisions to make, especially for the Germans. The Germans need to be aggressive and have a good appetite for risk if they are going to even have a chance of winning. Russians have a more straightforward task but they can't just blindly hold the ground. They also need to create opportunities to counterattack the Germans to disrupt their operational cycle.

That said, while Scenario 3 is just a learning scenario, the fuel supply for the Germans is too swingy! The difference between 1 fuel and 3 fuel affects the game too much and is something the German player has no control over. I would have preferred the less varied fuel supply, especially for such a short game, for the scenario to be more meaningful.

My first von Borries game and definitely not my last.  I really enjoy the scale of the battle and the counter density, for me, is perfect.  Thanks to the chit-pull mechanism, the game plays great as a solo experience.  While some have noted that the rules are a bit fiddly, I find that the logic behind them makes a lot of sense once you start moving units around.  Sometimes you miss some key points, like when I discovered that Artillery/Anti-Tank/Anti-Air units cannot advance after combat, but overall I find the various mechanisms to work together pretty smoothly.  It's also a lot of fun to have an East Front game where the Soviets are not just automatic pushovers.  You will definitely take a lot of losses as the Soviet player, but use of defensive terrain and timely counter-attacks really demonstrate how 'brittle' the German forces can be.  Would love to see more games in this series.

With the subject and the name of the designer, no question asked.  Received the game 17 months after preorder. I feel excited for the designer Vance von Borris, who has been in a cave for years for the next design.  Can't wait to put it on the table.  One map sheet with larger size 5/8" counters on three sheets (total 528 counters)!  A dream game for solitaire study at home.

Classic von Borries.  Not quite as road-bound as its predicessor, Roads to Leningrad, so the feel is halfway between that and von Borries' Eastern Front Series games. The formation chit activation really rewards maintaining some semblance of formation coherence.  That, and the greater granularity (battalians rather than regiments), is what sets the "Roads to" series above EFS for me.  Pieces, map and rules are all up to the GMT standard for clarity.  The game plays faster then I would have expected, an evening for the short scenarios and a full day for the long scenarios.

Two very interesting operational level battles from 1941 with a unique system.  The game isn't difficult, but it will take you a few readings of the rules and a few turns to figure out what exactly is going on here.  The combat system is quite involved, but there are only a few each activation.  Overall, a pretty good game, but you almost need to "unlearn" other games to get into it.

I found this compelling but less well organised tahn Roads to Leningrad. I am still unsure as to how some of the formations function regarding sub-units etc. Still, I've enjoyed playing it - with a fudge here and there - and this series generally allows the Reds their full status as brave soldiers.

Same system as Roads to Leningrad with a few minor tweaks. The scale is great, you got tons of choices, depth and just the right amount of randomness with the varying fuel supply and the weather, the chit pull activations and the D10 CRT. The scenarios portray two battles where both sides are mostly road bound. While the first half of Mozhaysk is fairly dynamic and fluid, the later stage and Mtsensk don't leave many opportunities for envelopment. So the fighting is often limited to frontal attacks on a small portion of the map. But it does a great job of depicting the Russian weather, with units sometimes barely able to advance at all when it starts to get muddy.

No rating yet as I am still learning the game.  It looks really well produced and yet I can't help but think the system is over-wrought and over-thought...mechanic heavy.  The first game (RT Leningrad) was pretty in depth and possibly overcooked as well, but for this second game alot of changes were made...I wonder if the system isn't chasing it's tail a bit with complex changes, rather than a refocusing on key elements. 

But that's speculative for now.  I'll edit this as I play.

While the mechanics are decent, I did not enjoy this as much as I did Roads to Leningrad for several reasons. Fuel shortages and winter weather reduce the German mobility.  While Leningrad's map created several interesting situations, Mozhaysk is just a grind.  You simply have two roads you have to move across the map on.  Fuel is too stingy to venture much beyond the main roads.  Thus you end up in a series of battles against the Russian's strongpoints.  The Russians are not interesting to play - not much reason to venture beyond their strongpoints so you just end up moving reinforcements to various victory point locations.  This game was too linear (literally for my tastes).  There was not much opportunity to surprise your opponent or cut off his supply lines.  The Germans just slogged from one side of the board to the other.

Was hesitant to play this for a long time. It was a good game after all. On the positive side, the mechanics were overall solid. The rules are somewhat complex, but works well after all. The scenarios tell you a lot about the conflict. On the negative side, it seems hard for the Germans to really get going. They are attacking on a tight front due to supply considerations. In the end a positive experience. In terms of complexity the games are about the same as GMT´s France 40 and Normandy 44..

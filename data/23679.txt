What an under-rated game. A bit long but by the 4th turn you are immersed in immediate and strategic decisions plus attempting to calculate the probability of your leaders surviving. Just when you get all that figured out the game morphs again just a few phases later. WHEW! love this game.

Who knew that the wars of England and France could be so much chaotic FUN! The hundred year war (and the other scenario...) in under 4 hours. Superb area-control chaos (the leader death mechanic) with many a-tides turning between the English and the French. Richard the Lionheart, Recruiting Mercenaries, Sieges, English Longbows, Bertrand de Guescin and Jean D'Arc the scourge of the English, how could you ask for more? I LOVE this game, but only an 8 due to its mechanical shortcoming - too much turn-phase bureaucracy for what is essentially a lighthearted war game.

A very abstract 100 Years war strategic simulation.
Each turn = 10 years

The chaos reflects well the reality of medieval warfare.
Not worth making large and elaborate plans, only faith in God and boldness of some great comanders and kings account! 
With game experience, playing time shortens: 2 or 3 hours per session.

Each of the turn order steps are ridiculously simple to learn and understand. In fact, when you’re done reading the rules, you may have a “Is this all there is?” type of feeling. But once you start playing and begin to realize how those steps and systems mix, mingle, and affect one another, only then do you grasp how much strategic complexity is inside the box. And while you throw fistfuls of dice throughout every game, there are very few rolls that don’t come with a little (or a ton) of breath-holding trepidation. Some may not like the chaos, but there’s little more comical than taunting your opponent during his leader death rolls, only to see your own leaders evaporate (and along with them, your best laid plans). Since there’s only so much advance planning that can be done, nearly every step during a game is one onto unsteady ground. The rules are simple and clear, the components gorgeous, and the narrative a brakeless car always on the cusp of losing a tire or two … or three. For sheer fun, WoG is hard to beat.

Excellent game! The leaders death system and the deployment of troops make the the game extremely strategical. THe different phases of the game are very immersive. YOu get the feel of being part of a big narrative, with leaders coming and going and territories constantly changing control. It is similar to Hammer of the Scots.

Very pretty, few rules, and fascinating gameplay. Recommended if you're into any type of wargame. About the only downside (from my point of view) is the playing time. It's a fairly long game but at least you're going to get some quality gaming minutes out of it. I can't quite call it a perfect transition from euro to wargames because of the long playing time but it's close.

I suppose I was expecting Warriors of God to be something like Crusader Rex.  In terms of complexity, it is on a similar level.  The combat also has that multi-round, buckets of dice approach familiar from Columbia games.  However, the leaders, with their differing abilities to lead troops and bravery in battle, and their uncertain longevity really give Warriors a very different feel.

For such a simple game, each turn gives you a lot to think about; how to make best use of a limited number of moves, where to attack or to reinforce, what types of troops to place, how to pin an opposing force to prevent it joining an attack, which leaders are likely to die and where new leaders could arrive, which of the unaligned leaders will I choose and what can I do with them...

As others have commented, there is a lot of randomness in the game.  Plan as much as you like, but occasionally a roll of 1 will kill a high quality leader on the turn they arrive and change the game.  

Overall, the game has a really strong narrative, gives you plenty to think about and is highly evocative of the history, so I'm prepared to live with the chaos.

In terms of production quality, Warriors is a huge step up from the MMP games I've previously played.  The map and counter artwork is outstanding.  The large size counters are really easy to handle and the player aids are a model of clarity.

Lowish complexity, beautiful art, manageable counter density, nice theme, readable rules, few ambiguities, two scenarios.  Great, right?  Right.  Well, the troop deployment phase takes up much of every turn but offers little opportunity for clever play.  Territory acquisition and battle leader death is based on 1d6 and the variance is potentially huge.  Sieges are easy to offer and hard to break.  This and that.  My only real personal knock after a couple of plays, though, is that I find the game too long - with my experience so far being that a full 12 turns can run over 4 hours.  Vassal always seemed to me yet another horrible UI for online board games, but the module for this looks really promising and might make it easier to split my games to boot.

A good game is one that provides meaningful decisions that aren't mitigated by luck. Unfortunately, this game is too simple for its own good. There aren't enough units or modifiers to reduce the high variance in this game. Thus, you have a 2-3 hour luckfest.

This game is crazy.  It's full of HUGE swings and enormous twists of fate.  With all the dice rolling and leaders dying it's like a crazy wild west shootout. 

Despite all the chaos, it feels...so far...pretty legit.  I mean.  There are times when I get stabbed in the heart by fate's cruel, barbed, dagger, and assume all is lost.  But when I look at the board and the score it almost always looks pretty damned even.

The moral of this game's story is that "Life's a bitch and both you and your opponent are going to suffer for it"

The wargaming equivalent of Chutes & Ladders.  You think you have choices, but you're really at the mercy of the random whim of the area control and leader death rules.  Any planning you do will be rendered useless by random die rolling.

That combination harkens back to Age of Imperialism.

See my review, if you want a more in-depth overview. I so wish more historical flavor and substance could be added. Don't tell the developer that you have any criticisms. His ego keeps him deaf to such nonsense.

Adam's responses are really odd; he does not have to pretend that any game he touches is without flaws, and his Arnhem games set a gold standard (though the rules still need clarification) on their own.

Okay, established is my disdain for the luck factor in Catan. But, whoa, I kinda dig the whole crazy randomness factor for this game - remember, we're dealing with big chunks of time here - gotta account for all of that 'off camera' treachery, accidents, and natural causes death that occurs.  I can't really rank this yet - gotta get a number of plays under my belt (and, geesh, willing opponents!) - but, this game just grabs me!

Nice looking game that should be an excellent choice for play at the Central Connecticut Wargaming Association.

Additional playings have reinforced the fact that this is a keeper.  Game is fast, fun, and furious.  Accept the chaotic element (leader death), and you'll have a blast -- since each turn is 10 years, just plan for the year, and you're actually doing "long range planning!"

Played solo and really enjoyed it. Got a half a game multiplayer under my belt now as well and I just have to get this on the table again soon!

It's interesting how the player with the initiative gets advantages in movement but then the non-initiative player gets advantages in unit placement which you really have to be aware of. There's forward planning required to deal with leaders who will arrive in future too.

Leader death is a good mechanism to provide a random element to the game, it will obviously benefit you if an opponent dies - unless you are holding him prisoner!

I love the way that the game can swing quite wildly to favour one side and then the other, just as the actual conflict in France did. You can also dispatch leaders to pillage the countryside and remove enemy control markers, which again reflects what happened historically.

A great game, which is not too difficult to pick up on your first play and should appeal to a fair few people based on the looks the game was getting when I played it.

RATING: 7.5
New from MMP, this light, fast paced war game covers the period of tension between England and France from the early 12th Century through the end of the Hundred Years War. Two scenarios are provided: The Lion in Winter (1135-1258), and The Hundred Years War (1337-1453). The game features area movement, sieges and open field battles, a constant churn of leaders entering the game, being killed or taken captive in battle and then, if they survive long enough, dying of old age. Units of several types (knights, long-bowmen, footmen and mercenaries) are raised, recruited and deployed where they then are assigned to surviving leaders. Some of the leaders can end up on either side as they enter the game and then change sides later as a result of combat. The game turns on victory points earned for taking and holding territory, killing leaders in battle or for holding them captive. Each scenario has a twelve turn limit with a provision for immediate victory.

The counters are oversized and look gorgeous. The map is sturdy paper that could have been more colorful to match the counters. The rules are well presented and filled with play examples. Play is smooth and engaging, but the non-deterministic nature of battle outcomes coupled with unpredictable leader deaths make for a war game with rather more chaos than is usual for the genre. The effect that the initiative die roll can have (this is one you really don't want to win too often) is particularly notable in this regard. If that doesn't put you off there is a lot to like about the game. Both scenarios can easily be squeezed together into a comfortable evening session. I was surprised to find myself enjoying the game despite my normal aversion to such arbitrariness.
------
Update: More playings have begun to tarnish the initial glow this game held for me. I am begining to get the same feeling playing this game that I got from Settlers of Catan (bad luck early, or for too many turns in a row, can make for a long night) and it does not bode well. Like Settlers, it would be better if this game played in half the time it takes...

God I love this game.  This is a game which is based on capturing leaders and controlling areas It is set in northern France and the surrounding .principalities.

It seems chaotic but really once you learn how to slighty predict leader ebb and flow you can grab chances to seize momentum.  If you have the momentum you have it as your leaders were lucky and your battles successful.  

When things seem to definately be nailed down for yourself, then all of a sudden 5-6 of your leaders can croak from old age and then their respective troops etc wander aimlessly unless gathered up by a fresh leader... or go away if not.

This game seems delicate in a way that reminded me of Napoleon's Triumph where that only by playing this game multiple times can you learn strategies and how to win more readily.

I laughed when my leaders get knocked on the head after a mere 10 years.  Especially as in my first game where both of my kings only lasted 1 turn.

I have a handful of games in of WoG now and enjoy it a great deal.  Yes the untimely death of key leaders at unpredictable times can be more of a setback than the enemies actions at times... but thus far I have a great time playing the game.  I hope to have even more fun when I actually win a game vs these more experienced WoG players I've been playing... but what I can see is their skill at the game clearly shows its not just a game of luck!

Area control with relatively slow moving "armies". The all important leaders are both brittle and fickle in that 1/3 of all turn reinforcements may join either side. How does a French Robin Hood grab you? All this means chaos, which disturbs some players. I choose to take games as they are and look at each as a challenging puzzle. Simple rule set means focus is on game play. Lovely components despite the stark areas on the map. A worthy addition to the "puzzle" game genre I tend to place C&C:A, KPW and most Columbia games into. Sit back and play it. Oh and .... Beware the French Blue Blob!

RATING: 7.8
A long and detailed game.  The rules in this are quite straight-forward when the game gets rolling, I like the ever changing landscape (with leaders arriving and dying and different troops available).  To get the most out of this game players need to play several times and understand the pace of the game, at what times is it better for the French or English to be defensive/aggressive given the leaders available and the leaders coming.  It is a very interesting game - one I would be very happy to play again.

The visual design of the game is excellent.  I love the map, the art and the quotes - very enjoyable.

Rating based on first play. It's an interesting study of chaos management. Lots on unexpected twists and turns to deal with as leaders die either early of past their prime. It seemed difficult to plan for any sort of long range strategy because you really couldn't tell what you would have for resources. One turn you would be ready to make a push, only to find that a bunch of your young leaders passed away due to bad rolling. In this game you have to just deal with it and be willing to roll with the punches.

RATING: 7
This game is really immensely satisfying.  Ever since I got MW's Gettysburg, Ashar and I have been exploring wargames more, and this one had many interesting mechanisms attached.  Some people find the random nature of determining initiative and leader death off-putting, but for me all these elements simply reinforce the theme.  Yes, this game is one of the best I've played at implementing mechanics that actually augment the theme and make for game play that feels historically accurate and narrative.  The leader death element gives the game an epic and tragic sweep - for heavens sake, the era the game simulates is over 100 years in length, so expecting leaders not to die is kind of unrealistic.  This element alone gives you a God-like perspective that few other games I've played have managed to. 

The game is easy to learn rules-wise, enough so that perhaps others than war gamers might like it.  (I consistently get my ass kicked by my wife no matter which side I'm playing, so she's a fan).  Even if you don't like war games, this one deserves a look.

Played once, it was fun. Like every other IGS game it's too long for what it is, but since we're talking 3-4 hours when it should be 2-3, it's not quite the show-stopper it is for Fire in the Sky (10+ hours when it wants to be maybe 5) or A Victory Lost (5+ hours when it should be maybe 3). Warriors of God is ridiculously chaotic, even by the standards of light games, and there is a lot of opportunity for frustration with good leaders dying while incompetent ones survive (if you're unlucky), and very high-stakes siege die rolls.

Anyway, this has a sort of Britannia-like feel, with leaders coming and going and dicey combat, and as such it's fun in a lot of the same ways as Britannia is, albeit much shorter. I'm not complaining, and I think Warriors of God really does deliver in the area of a  light, fun wargame. And the price is right.

I only had two concerns: firstly, getting control of areas is kinda tough, so it's actually rather hard to develop a coherent territorial strategy. Even if you successfully siege and destroy an opponent in an area, you can only take control of it on a die roll equal to your leader's ranking, so we're talking 1 in 3 usually.  This makes the game feel (to me) a little disjointed. Also, the rules for raising troops are a little strange, and the relative scarcity of leaders means you're rarely under any kind of manpower pressure, which to me feels a little odd. Lastly, the historicity of the game is somewhat compromised by the fact that you know how good all your leaders are and know how powerful the longbow is, so something like Agincourt can never occur - the French will rather a-historically run away rather than face the longbows. It's OK, and every wargame deals with this to some degree, but having some hidden information and surprises would have been nice. Fire in the Sky had this same issue of seemingly inappropriate perfect knowledge.

Anyway, this is all a bit of waffle, I liked Warriors of God but wasn't blown away by it. I see it getting some play, but probably not a ton. The playing time is the saving grace I think; if it were any longer at all, it would be a serious problem. But as it is it's OK, and the chaotic situation is fun.

Like the rest of the IGS lineup, WoG is beautifully produced and the game play offers something different from traditional wargames.

Some players have expressed concern that the dice rolls at the end of each turn (decade) that determine which leaders survive and which newly occupied provinces gain control markers are too chaotic. They do certainly limit the amount of planning a player can do beyond the current decade but the luck inherent in these dice rolls isn't much greater than, say, the new card and leader draws at the end of every turn in Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. In both cases I find the level of luck reasonable given the great spans of time that are being represented and their lightweight, quick playing nature.

There's currently a lot of competition these days in the medium-light "weeknight" wargames niche and I'm not sure WoG is so outstanding that it will garner much table time over its peers but so far at least it certainly seems to hold its own.

UPDATE: After more plays, I've decided the luck factor is more significant than I indicated in my initial write-up. Reducing my rating to a 6.

Stylish counters, not so sure about the dung-coloured paper map. Interesting initiative/number of actions mechanism. The random death of leaders keeps both players in contention but makes any long-term planning tricky. As the French player, make sure that Joan of Arc goes into battle against the '1' bravery rated leaders and that King Charles (the counter rated 1/1) stays in Ile de France so that he can hide in his castle if attacked. Several plays.

A neat game, with unique systems that grow on you.  WofG manages to capture the intrigues and changing alliances of longer, multiplayer treatments of the period.  Imagine El Grande with battles, historical accuracy, tension, fun ...


Like most IGS titles, the designer has given us a completely different view of the time period.  It takes a couple plays to understand the game, and once appreciated it can be incredibly immersive, evocative of its historical period, and fun as hell.

The game is also physically attractive with tremendous attention paid to the little things.  Finally a wargame that can honestly say it raises the bar that *Euros* have to meet.

One final note ... the use of dice does not equate to "randomness" as probabilities are observed and understood by the intelligent gamer.  The dice lend tremendous playability, and variety.  That having been said, I would never play this game competitively.  But for fun, challenge (both tactical and strategic) and for an interesting narrative it is an excellent choice.

Update, after a dozen + plays WofG has stood the test of time and is enjoyed every time I put it on the table although I will grant that it doesn't get put on the table much anymore.

Have played two games solo, neither one to completion.  I felt confident rating this game, however, because I absolutely loved the design.  It is a unique game that covers 100+ years of English-French war, leaders die, armies fade, and area control is all-but impossible.  If you don't like chaos management games, don't play this game.  Update:  Played a complete game face-to-face and loved it in practice.  I am more confident than ever of my rating of this game.

11/30/09 Update: After several face-to-face plays against various opponents over the past year, I can say that I "grok" this game.  It is enjoyable, but newer players will be at a severe disadvantage until they learn how to manage the chaos.  This is an area-control game that is far, far more about claiming land areas than it is about winning battles.

Update: 
I really enjoyed playing Warriors of God, this last time. The situation was quite fluid and chaotic, but at the end you got this historical feel and some broad brush strategies (establish a beachhead, keep force at large threat, conquer continuous territory). And boy, were there some tension filled moments of dice rolling... In essence, although I still feel that the initiative mechanism is badly implemented, and luck is more prominent than in traditional wargames, the game is a keeper both due to the mechanisms but also the historical period. Yes, I changed my mind.

---

This is a weird one. 

I love many things about the game. The components are super nice, the rules are easy to comprehend and written with flair. The basic premise of leader succession and unpredictability is also intriguing. There also seem to be plenty of opportunities for strategic play, and decisions are usually quite interesting. Despite all of these redeeming qualities though, the game fails for me on several levels: 

1. The way leader succession is implemented is anti-thematic, you have full visibility of the qualities of future leaders, and is about the only game element that you can plan. 

2. The initiative system is too strong, surprisingly with the upper hand being enjoyed by the non-initiative player. Being able to get the best variable leader, and to recruit forces first more than compensates for the extra action. Worse, you cannot plan to gain initiative, it's just based on luck.

3. The game is more about area control sprinkled with conflict, than about war. Although the VP structure leads to interesting strategies and tactics, I feel more like playing a euro or an abstract rather than playing a wargame. 

4. Lastly, for what it is, this game is terribly long. This is not a medium length wargame, this is a very long euro.

Overall, this is not a wargame that will teach you history, like my friend Enrico said in his great video review of the game, and I really dislike that. We play wargames to learn and to simulate, euros and amerigames got the mechanics and good-old-fun-time angles covered anyway. So why play this one? I really have no idea. I understand why people like, but to these folks I say, play a good area control euro instead. 

This game could have been really epic. A missed opportunity.

After 1 play it seems like an excellent game design, despite all the phases involved, and appears more tactical than strategic. A kind of area control game with lots of battles and tactics depending on what, and where leaders arrive each turn. Some luck with die rolls, and a bit random with leaders coming and going, but there's plenty to think about tactically. The advertised 3 hrs game time is a joke but would prob be quicker (4-5hrs) with more plays. Good fun.

Jeu amusant, qui retranscrit bien les impressions de l'époque, chacun des 12 tours de jeu est une campagne à lui seul...Malheureusement, au bout de 3 parties le jeu devient très redondant.
Mis à part la phase de manoeuvres qui peut être très réduite en raison d'un mauvais jet de dé d'initiative, le reste est de la gestion de troupes ou de mortalité des chefs...Dans les premiers tours on s'amuse bien mais à la longue ces phases deviennent lassantes.
La mortalité des chefs est une bonne règle mais elle morcèle le jeu. On a du mal à anticiper sa stratégie et la phase de manoeuvres devient un temps d'interprétation des règles pour placer son adversaire en difficulté. Pas de stratégie globale mais au coup par coup..."Tiens je te mets un autre chef là, donc tu ne peux plus bouger car tu n'as pas assez de chefs dans la même zone"...
Bref globalement, un jeu un peu décevant. L'idée était d'en faire un jeu à garder sur la durée comme un "Storm over Stalingrad", on peut y rejouer de temps en temps sur une courte soirée, sans que cela révolutionne le "wargame"...Mais ce n'est pas le cas. Dommage!"...

At a first glance it seems too abstract and gamey. But the game is actually captures some aspects of the 100 years war pretty good. Treacherous nobles, big battles, small skirmishes and the wars against Scotland. Abstracted? Yes, but it's all there. 
Biggest selling point: it's a tense game.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game but IMHO overated. I'd be happy to play it on occasion.

My main issue is that the game fall between two stools. I'd rather play a more detailled and historically accurate wargame, or If it just to give a feel for the period with light weight rules, I'd rather play an  an eurostyle boardgame with tighter mechanisms and playing time around 90 min. 

As an historical simulation the game is so high level that it doesn't gives a lot of insight on the period.

As a game, it is an exercise in chaos management. I have no problem with the many dice rolls. However there lengthy procedures to repeat every turns. And for a simple areas conflict game the combat rule are a bit convoluted, and goes against the otherwise simple rules.

A bit too long and repetitive for the decisions involved.

The production quality is good from a wargames publisher, but again euro bordgames offer more bang for the bucks.

Un wargame qui couvre toute la guerre de Cent ans. Le matériel est plaisant et les règles très abordables (avec une pointe d'humour, ce qui ne gâche rien).
Les joueurs auront plus à cœur de saisir et conserver les régions, plus qu'à vouloir à tout prix combattre. Un jeu de manœuvre et de sièges principalement.

I ended up holding onto a copy for somebody.  Didn't really interest me.  Then I opened it up and took a serious look.  Wow.  This is one hell of a game.  You have only a vague idea of what you'll be able to do next turn.  Expect to see half a dozen leaders die each turn, usually due to the ravages of time, and the number of activations that the sides will get is determined randomly along with initiative (initiative side gets one more than the loser), but there's plenty of opportunity to plan for the possibilities and every new turn will bring new challenges and opportunities.Every leader has a use, even the abysmal Charles VI (though admittedly, you probably won't be too sad to see him shuffle off this mortal coil).  There are some things that struck me as odd, such as a Richard I (of Aquitaine) who becomes King of either England or France being unable to command knights, and the ability of a sufficiently superior force to, given extra time to remove a control marker, force a field battle instead of a siege.  It's also surprisingly difficult to take control of an area, though denying it to the enemy isn't hard (which sounds like, in a nutshell, what little I know of the Hundred Years War).  But I'll also admit to a fair amount of ignorance of the historical period, so perhaps these are entirely reasonable.  I was also struck by Thomas Beckett as a reasonably competent field commander (and, as a quirk of the rating system, a master of siegecraft) - but with a game of this complexity level, one can't expect all the colorful characters of the era to fit into a simple two-number rating system (three if you count rank, which is what the stars at the top of the counters indicate) without a little bending.

RATING: 7
(Preliminary rating based on a partial play.)  Fun, simple wargame of century-long conflicts between England and France.  Not quite like anything else I've played, but it only took a couple of turns to get the hang of things.

One of the keys to playing the game is carefully monitoring the leaders who are scheduled to appear in future turns and adjusting your play accordingly.  Rare high-quality leaders and those based in important areas are crucial, especially the ones who can be drafted by either player.  This is incredibly gamey -- nothing wrong with that, but it will definitely turn off some people.

What keeps this from a higher rating for me is the combination of chaos and play length.  It's a pretty lightweight game that can suffer large victory point swings due to a few die rolls going the wrong way.  This isn't an inherently bad thing for a simple and fun game.  However, it becomes a problem when the game requires a large time investment.  If this game took 2-3 hours to play, I'd give it an 8 or maybe even a 9.  As it is, I just don't see getting through it in less than 4 hours at an absolute mininum, with 5 a more likely session.

I like this game and the strategic and tactical choices that it presents for a relatively simple set of rules. The recreation of the ebb and flow of the 100 Years War, and the story like unfolding of the battles and exploits of the leaders is very thematic and enjoyable.

It does lose at least a mark however for the fact that luck can completely dictate the who wins - of the three areas where luck plays a big role in the game - Leader Death, Battle Resolution and 'Control of Regions' it is the first for me that is the problem. The fact that there is such a variable element thrown into the game in these areas creates a huge amount of chaos which I actually think is a good/fun thing as it is constantly resetting the tactical and strategic options. Individual battles goinng against the odds or your opponent taking a region under control are not game breakers, however one turn where your leaders are all but wiped out by death roles and your opponent's aren't creates a massive swing in the game and unless there is a compensating swing the following turn it is all but impossible to recover.

I am tempted to introduce a house-rule to limit the extent of imbalance that bad leader death roles can bring to what is otherwise a very good game.

Tentative score is optimistic, so repeat play change my opinion. There is merit to all the quibbling about randomness all over the place, but at the end of the day the unexpected events end up making it interesting and rewarding. Minor nobles will pop up in quite unexpected places, leading unexpected armies, and sometimes holding out at improbable odds! The great unaligned nobles are the one of the most fun part of this fast and quick-playing syste.

"The 100 Years War was a pivotal event in medieval European history. As always, playability matched with historical accuracy has been achieved to a remarkable degree. Players move their leaders and units using a unique impulse game system that shows both the strategy and tactics of the period. The game also recreates the massive swings of fortune which were so much a part of the Hundred Years War.

Even with such a simple and easily learned system, all the special rules necessary to give players a full feel for the period are here: archers, Joan of Arc, and much, much more."

The luck element in this game will both drive you bananas and keep you coming back for more.

RATING: 7
I'm just getting into this one, but I like it so far.  Gameplay is more akin to Risk than a traditional wargame, but it hits a sweet spot in terms of speed and complexity, and with just enough chrome to give it some historical feel.  The Mark Mahaffey map provides a nice period flavor. 

The boundary rules are a bit... odd. A leader with an army size of 9 can cross an unstructed boundary in a single turn, but two leaders with 1 army size each cannot. The death checks at the end of each turn are a nice touch.

I've read complaints about the high degree of randomness, but I don't think this is much more random than the average wargame. Yes, the death checks can make or break your big attacks, but even that is a fairly small setback over the course of a 12 turn game, so the luck should (usually) even out. I'd guess that the more skilled player will beat his or her opponent 4 games in 5.

Great game about the 100 years war between England and France. I enjoy it but beware... people who like to plan everything and don't like any randomness might not be the biggest fan of this game.

Leaders can and will die. This is decided by rolling a dice. The older they are the bigger the chance they die but you never know when. Creating a big army with a young leader, only to see him die early can cause a lot of trouble. Without leader, your troops go home or even worse, your enemy is able to recruit them for his own use (against you)

Feels a bit "blown up" like it used to be a magazine game and doesn't necessarily have to be a "bigger" board game. Some aspects of it are very lite. The luck factor is huge and the decisions are relatively trivial. 
But it is a good 2 player game to scratch the "Britannia"-itch and plays along at a good pace, so it can basically be recommended. Don't get too close to your leaders - they never die at opportune moments (just like in real life).

A very fun, light wargame. Although a lot of dice gets thrown in this game and things can get pretty random with the leaders deaths and siege rolls, there's enough strategy (and more importantly, fun) here to justify a high rating. 

A lot of this game is knowing when to gamble and when to play it cautious. Players who recognise that their good leaders won't be around forever and seize the opportunity will do better than turtling players. But players also have to pick their fights carefully. The fact that sieges can result in "feast or famine" creates a delicious dilemma, especially in sieges for critical areas. 

Despite its lightness, the theme is very well done in the game and brings out the Shakespeare when playing. :) "What's he that wishes so? My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin..."

Can be a bit long though, though more practice can get this to 3+ hours.

[1 play] What a wild ride.  The amazing turnover of your leaders really makes you feel like the game spans 100 years.  The downside of this impermanence of your leaders, is that it reduces your choices to mostly tactical ones.  I do very much like the different feel each of the leaders have based on their command rating, bravery, and battle rating, though.  Ultimately, I can't help feeling like I would enjoy it more at 2 hours than at 3+.  While I laughed my ass off waiting for my captured leaders to die and rooting for a quick death of my opponents, this will likely wear off quickly and the lack of long term strategic depth will see me playing other games.

Beautifully produced game.  The map art and counter art is far better than most war games.  This game has high levels of abstraction for the units and leaders, but it works because of the time frame.  The leader death can be a bit chaotic, but this also fits the theme.  Despite the chaos there are plenty of agonizing decisions to make each turn.   Overall a very nice, and quick playing war game.

Great light wargame with good components and good solitaire suitability.

The "luck dependent dice fest" that others complained about, it is not.

Leader death rolls, ini rolls, etc. is not a bug, it's a feature!
It mirrors the chaotic warfare during this period were nothing worked as planned.
So,be flexible and always have a plan "B".

Recommended.

Only played about 1/2 a game solo. It needs playtime again in order to re-rate. Since it is very difficult to plan ahead, with the leaders dying suddenly & unpredictably, creating any kind of viable strategy is thrown out the window, it seems. I realize this models the length of the period and it's chaos, but for game purposes it can be a bit difficult. Whoever manages the chaotic swings of luck best will no doubt win the game. So from that standpoint, I suppose it can be an engrossing game.

The game is won by victory points which is accumulated by controlling provinces and capturing or killing leaders. Comes in two scenarios with one of them(Lion in Winter) which is not found in the Japanese edition of the game. Very highly recomended.

Units pop up 'anywhere'.  There is a large luck element, especially if you best leader dies young, or if you're unable to 'persuade' provinces to join your cause.  I also missed 28 combat dice in a row (with the final 4 needing 5 or 6's) *geesh*  Fun though, with first play taking about 4 hours.

Un wargame que, para ser disfrutado, no debe tomarse en serio. El azar tiene un protagonismo tan absoluto que deja a los demás elementos en un plano secundario. Y que conste que no por ello deja de tener unas reglas y unas mecánicas bastante ingeniosas. Se puede disfrutar si, como digo, los jugadores se pliegan al omnipresente e incontrolable azar y se dejan llevar llevando a cabo aquello que los dados les permitan realizar. A destacar los componentes, muy bonitos, y las fichas de enorme tamaño.

It hasn't grown on me since I wrote the review.  The tactical decisions are interesting and the long term planning is too, mostly because its a very different type of long term planning than most wargames.  I'm getting disenchanted with the randomness of the control rolls and the fact that you can call the game when Joan of Arc hits.  Either England is way ahead and can pin her down or she is going to run wild and France has it.

Perhaps I'll write an addendum to my review at some point...

Silly game? Sure, but it's also lots and lots of fun. I've also never felt like the outcome was decided by the dice-luck. Leader death of course makes it a challenge to maintain offensives, but it's a similar conundrum to the English wintering in Hammer of the Scots. Map is overly brown, but other components are really nice. Rulebook is funny, though that seems to be a common, if unexpected, trait of wargame rulebooks.

This is an extremely fun, exciting and absorbing game. The leader deaths and appearances punctuate the gameplay and convey a sense that the game's action takes place in episodes embedded in a much longer history that is shaped by the contest but which players don't completely control. While some might complain that those moments are too disconnected, that one cannot really predict how old each leader will live, and so on, the connective tissue between the rounds is easy to reconstruct with a bit of historical imagination. More importantly, the spikes of change that pepper the game give it a colourful openness that compels players to improvise and adapt. Since the game requires one to refocus and take stock after each round, it provoked (in me at least) a presence of mind and attention that was quite delicious. That presence of mind is exactly what I look for in a game.

This is a terrific little wargame displaying the extreme mortality of the day, and making players deal with all the fluctuations of fortune and whims of the dice.

The system has the British and French players selecting non-allied leaders each round, and gaining them as time is appropriate.  Gaining the advantage in movement and initiative grants an extra move, but yields first selection.

The play really brought out how odd some of the battlles of the day were, and how luck and good leadership sometimes won the day from what was on paper a superior foe.

I loved my first play- I'm starting this at a 7.5, and now I am longing harder for the day when Warriors of Japan finally comes out.

The rules were pretty easy to learn, but there are interesting decisions.  Fortunes can change quickly due to dicey battles and leader deaths (so there is a lot of randomness).  The game plays very tactically because the situation can change so drastically from turn to turn.  The components are good.  The map is both pretty and functional.  However, the game runs a bit long for me. With this much randomness, I generally don't want to see the game take more than 1.5 hours to play.

Extreme Chaos game!  Extreme Chaos!  Think you're on top of the world?  How will you feel when all of your leaders die?  

Nice flavor.  I'm starting to really like it.

Based on only two plays of the 100 Yrs War scenario & 1 play of Lion in Winter.  Overall, its a fantastic game that is very approachable and playable.  Long term, I think the random leader death may disrupt its chances of being received as an all-time classic but the system is great and while its low complexity, the amount of detail and tactical choices are staggering.  Highly recommended in the vein of approachable wargames like Hammer of the Scots or We the People.

RATING: 8
Rating based on one solo and two ftf plays. Very nice light-medium weight wargame (i.e. it's almost off the scale compared to most Euros). It felt a little like a Columbia block game (Hammer of the Scots in particular) without the blocks - which is fine by me as HOTS is a favourite of mine.

However, leader death/capture, troop deployment and the area control rules make it a different game in its own right.

RATING: 9
Excellent game on the Hundred Years War. A medium paced game with excitement.  What makes the game very erratic (and a challenge to play) is the random leader deaths. So, in one turn, you think you're winning and then your best leaders die and you'd have to make do with a new set of leaders.  The English leaders have an advantage over the French since they have the archer advantage but proper French play can blunt the English.  For the French, the key to victory is planning your strategy long term.  All in all, great game.

RATING: 9
Chaotic game of the Hundred Years War. The rules are disarmingly simple and clearly (humorously in places!) written. Randomness--one of the naughtiest words on BGG--is central to play, and you have to adjust for it, even welcome it. Your best-laid plans will be wrecked. Your talented battle commanders will die at inopportune times. You will be left kingless now and then. 

It works though, and the way the phases within each turn are structured fills you with this oddly enjoyable trepidation. You raise troops and deploy them, but will your leaders snuff it before they can take command? You triumphantly claim an enemy leader in battle and shuttle him off to prison, but he contracts a fever and dies before you can score VP for him! 

The game is a gorgeous production. I ended up sliding the map into a cheap 23x35 poster frame.

Enjoyed this games immensely - I have to say it's one of the best two player games I have. It can be a bit lenghty, so I recommend if your going to play, set enought time aside. I don't mind the game length mainly due to strategy (deploying troops, placing leaders) but if your pressed for time - you may want to play something else.

Really an area control game with slapped on conflict theme.  I found the decisionmaking less important than the die rolls for leader death and control of territories.  Large battles are almost never worth fighting for one side or the other and so you never get anything like the decisive engagements of the actual war (Crecy, Poitiers, Agincourt).  The massive defections of armies on the death of a leader are simply absurd and without meaningful precedent.  If you look at the actual history, the struggle was much less chaotic than how devotees of the game try to portray it...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Approachable wargame even for a Eurogamer like me. The frequent leader deaths avoid the stacking of tons of units which I strongly dislike in wargames or Ameritrash. They help to keep the game moving. I also like the initiative system which allows almost eurogame-like tactics with pinning down opposing leaders and going for area control. The mapboard and counter design is gorgeous. Only drawback is the too long playing time for a heavily luck-dependent game as this. 8 or 9 turns instead of 11 would suffice.

Too many rules not played right in first game:
- Stacking limit is 3x rank (not battle rating *dough*)
- Remove enemy control marker AND roll for control in just conquered areas
- +1 hit bonus on run-away rolls (mostly forgotten)
- Troops stay on board on leaders death until phase 10
- Knights only to be led by 3* leaders

RATING: 8
Warriors of God is a great game. It is quick to set up and quick to play. The rules are easy to understand and easy to teach. I am looking forward to playing this a lot. The two scenarios and the way that non-aligned leaders are handled will add a bit of variety to every game and help keep things interesting. 
To address the question of all the dice rolling. I think that the "luck" in this game adds to the theme. The length of time covered in the Hundred Years War makes it likely that bad things will happen to these people. The leader death mechanism helps influence strategy. I find that I am more willing to take risks knowing that a leader is probably going to die soon, than I would necessarily take otherwise. If you plan your supply lines and set up a "chain of command" per se, you probably won't have any problem losing your leaders. (This of course coming from the person that had Edward III last until turn 5.) I can see why some people would be opposed to this game, but I don't think I agree that there is too much luck. Where some see luck, I see a mechanism that really adheres to the theme of the game.

I am giving this game a 9 out of 10 and think that you should check it out. I think if you like history games, you will enjoy this one

Unpopular, but very good game in my opinion.

It uses dices but it doesn't have big impact on the game. During the battle very many rolls are made, so statistics works. It's quite more random during deaths of the leaders but so far I think it's ok.

Several interesting mechanics like movement blocking and taking control of the province makes the game interesting and luck-independent. You have to think and plan well, not get the good cards (there is no cards).

At first, "Warriors of God" simply and pleasantly met my expectations as I found myself loving the roller-coater ride of what one BGG reviewer aptly termed "Chaos Management 101". After a few playings, however, surprising strategic depth began to shine through the chaos. Meets the classic litmus test: Easy to play, but not so easy to play WELL.This is a game that keeps revealing more of itself with each play... it's going to grace my table for a long time to come. As an added bonus, it plays almost as well solitaire.

100 Years War...yeah, how can a war last that long?  Coming up in 2008 if it can be on schedule.

Excellent game.  The game is best for the games I played for a while recently.  The amount of satisfaction is high out of this gameplay experience.  Highly recommended from both the persepctives of historical level of simulation and competitive gameplay.  Game system is highly streamlined and flows smoothly without too many abstraction.  Everything makes sense.  The insignia of all factions in fighting are marvellous research achievements.  You really feel you ARE in command, and from a high level of command - Commander-in-Chief. 

The game is a beauty - of simplicity in many rule details having expounding effects on the game strategies and developments.  The choices seem to be easy to make but the possibilities are boundless.  Sign of a great game.

Great game! Have to get your head wrapped around the combat rules - not complex but can be misread. Leaders: they DIE. At 9-10 years per turn and life expectancy in that time maybe 40 years - you roll for each one each turn with increasing risk of death. A bad set of rolls and you go from a force ready to crush the other side to squat!

Counters are large and thick. Map is lovely but who decided the sea connection arrows needed to be so large.

Rating based on solo play only. 

I've just punched and clipped the counters, got myself around the rules (written very naturally with a little tongue in cheek for good measure) and played through once solo. It's fun (and lovely to look at). First impressions are; I understand why others laud it for its solitaire compatibility but I still feel like I miss that other player to duke it out with, and suspect that with two is where it really shines. I can imagine having a good chuckle with a friend as leader upon leader bite the dust en masse in this slightly bizarre alternate version of history. It's light and just a little bit silly. And that's ok. I don't know yet how I feel about the whole 'playing two sides of the fence' thing though, which is obviously not a fault of the game itself. Admittedly, this is my first attempt at such a type of game so it's definitely too early to tell (I still have yet to explore Warriors of Japan and A Most Dangerous Time from MMP in my collection). The good news is that the game is really very straight forward and accessible to understand, and as such I can realistically imagine being able to find that elusive second player out there. And for the meantime, I will get the usual pleasure out of unfolding all the game's mechanisms and appreciating the synergies (I love the 'zero-sum' scoring track concept for example), whilst educating myself just a little on a period that is interesting to me.

07/24/08 Received. It had been a while since I'd had to punch out cardboard counters from a "real" wargame company. All these German games with their counters that just about fall out of the frames lulled me into thinking all publishers had now learned to make their counter sheets that way. Nope. MMP's are "old school". It was 30 minutes work with a very sharp X-acto knife to get them out of the frames without tearing them up. 

As to how it plays... I like it. Yet the official time estimate of 3 hours is totally unrealistic. Something like 6.5 hours has been my experience for a full 12 turn game. Therefore I took a point off my rating for that. I felt the publisher purposefully misled me. The alleged play time of 3 hours figured prominently in my decision to buy or pass on this game. In hindsight I probably would have passed. 

I have yet to play a full 12 turn game (except solitaire). The three games I've so far played against another human were all to turn 7. The first in four hours and the second in three hours. And the third in 3.7 hours. Even at the rate of the second game that would still take 6 hours for a full game. 

12/05/09 Played a fourth game, winning on turn six in three hours. I upped my rating from 7 to 8. 

09/22/12 Played a fifth time; 7 turns in 3.1 hours. In fact, I've yet to have a game last more than 7 turns. Usually by turn 4 one player gains such an insurmountable lead the "snowball rolling down hill" effect takes over and its impossible for the other guy to turn things around (barring some freakish catastrophe occurring, like 80% of the leading player's leaders dieing). Then turns 5-7 are just waiting for the inevitable (the winner to get to 30 points). Warriors of God is usually not the type of game where one can come from far behind and win; not impossible, but rare. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. Merely if that's a quality you like this may not be the game for you. 
10/20/12 Game #6: 6 turns in 2.9 hours. 08/17/13 Game #7: 10 turns in 5.2 hours. 04/26/14 Game #8: 10 turns in 4.3 hours. Game #9: 12 turns in 4.75 hours.

Found a copy in Valencia, and had to get it.  Well-designed, and once we got the rules down, easy to play.  Love the uncertainty of the leader deaths, and the cumulative scoring.  It lasts a shade too long (10 turns would have been great), but I think it is a very good one anyway.

Map art is both functional and fitting. Counters are great, easy to read and pretty.  Only two charts, and you barely need to use them.  Small rule book. 70% wargame, 30% Euro game.  3-6 hours playing time.  Luck can play a fairly large role, but actually a large element of fate seems fitting for these struggles.  Historically, probably a good look at the era(s).

RATING: 7
Played the 100 Years War scenario and really liked it.  The rule set is easy to digest and play seems to capture the era well.  New leaders pop up on the board each round and can sprout up on the region they were born or one you have control of.  The chance of a leader dying through natural death each round increases the older they get.  Some leaders are also drafted as a balance to the initiative mechanism.  This makes for a nice narrative and adds variability and excitement which increases its replayability.  Movement on the board can be quite a chess match with interesting choices to make each round as your position strengthens or weakens based on the fate of the leaders and your opponent's maneuvering.

RATING: 9
Not perfect but very, very good.  One must plan for misfortune and be prepared to be decisive when good fortune arrives.  One unlucky turn can derail many turns of careful preparation and one could argue that the game can swing either way much too quickly, but it's still an incredibly fun and engaging game.  Gameplay is remarkably deep, especially so given its relatively low complexity.

A smart, straight forward game which relies more on historical flavour than historical simulation. Perhaps a little limited in variety, it can feel a touch repetitious, and a few additional events other than the fantastic rise and fall of leaders wouldn't have gone amiss, but it is easy to learn, moves quickly (although the game itself takes some time to play) and creates a lot of laughs, misery and entertainment. Put it on a similar complexity level to games such as Crusader Rex, I think that the world needs more wargames that combine this level of quality with a shorter playing time.

RATING: 6
Played 3 times. I have had fun playing it but mainly because of gaming partner I think, as the game has also been highly frustrating because it is ridiculously dependent on lucky dice rolls. These rolls are used to check if your leaders die of natural causes - and several good leaders do end up dying after 1 turn (1 on a d6). One point in the middle of the game I had 1 leader surviving and 7 leaders dying all on rolls 1-3. Because you have to deploy troops before checking if leaders die (you then add new leaders) this does not allow you to make any medium term plans at all. The other piece of luck is with checking if you can take control of a region. Even with a king it is only 50% chance of taking control of regions, and with the worst leaders 1 in 6, so if one player gets a few lucky "1"s they are doing well. Luck does balance out - in my last game I was losing by 20 VP in the middle but came back to tie the game by the last turn. But this just means that both sides suffer equal frustrations at one point or another.

UPDATE 3: Well, I need to play again. My brain got the better of me and I read the post-combat portion of the rules 4x. Then I realized that the only real chaos is Leader Death. Everything else in the game can be planned for, as I understand it. Alas....my critiques were going so well...

UPDATE 2: After playing a special scenario and attained a runaway victory, my feelings have solidified: I don't understand the hype. The game is harmless and interesting, but way too long and chaotic and unintuitive for what it ends up being.  There are better, shorter, deeper 2-player wargames out there.

UPDATE: I don't like this game nearly as much as all my friends do, but I understand why they like it. The designers seem to have gone to great lengths to be "different" and to make the rules counter-intuitive.  It should be a much shorter, more elegant game for what it actually delivers.  But it seems the designers are suffering from an acute case of "grognardism", and due to WoG's popularity, it won't be cured any time soon.

Interesting.  Chris Farrell gives it a 7 for the very same reason I think it deserves a 5:  namely, there is too much chaos, luck, and incoherence to develop any strategy.  If many of the mechanics and the sequence of play weren't so counter-intuitive, none of this would bother me very much.  But, I've yet to play a full game of it, so I won't rate it, yet.  I'll just shake my head and bitch about it here.

This game is not only well presented, it also plays well. Simple rules, but lots of interesting decisions. The leader deaths and choice of unaligned leaders add a lot of chaos and require that you think on your feet. I especially like the importance attached to raising and deploying new troops. If you do not have a contingency plan in case your good leaders die, you can see a large army go to waste - or worse, taken over by an enemy noble.

RATING: 8
At first this feels fairly light with lots of tactical play, but there also is room for fair chunk of strategy. The leaders really make the game, giving it historical flavour and character.  Their fragility determines the ebb and flow of the game, although it can be frustrating when a prominent leader dies prematurely. The knowledge that a leader can die at any time adds impetus to attacks, but this is well balanced by the fact that wasting leaders lives or letting them get captured gifts your opponent vital victory points. For some reason it reminds me of an old computer game (though I couldn't tell you what) with daring attacks, favourite characters, a wildly fluctuating map, but mostly a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
The rules are probably easy for a wargame, yet I strongly recommend short rules for the first play. There are a lot of tiny things one can easily forget. If I wanted to compare its heaviness to a Euro game, I'd say Dungeonlords. Some of the rules are unintuitive, first and formost: troops cannot be reassigned. Hmmm, strange rule.

Gameplay: Book keeping and decisions are merged in a strange manner. It's difficult to understand how leader characteristics, unit types, available tactics and victory point archievements interact. First gameplay including lots of rule checking took 7(!) hours for 4 turns. I think I understood the mechanisms and rules now, but like many other good games, it has a learning curve. It seems crucial to know where to place new leaders, and what to do with them. The general feeling of the game reminds me of Columbia gmaes like "Richard III" or "Hammer of the Scots", though the mechanisms I think are thematically sound and more interesting. For a wargame, I like WoG a lot and hope for many plays, but I am not sure if the long time plays off. Also, my impression is that luck is a bit too decisive, i.e. rolls for area control and leader death.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game reflecting the time-period quite well, with chaos & war all around, leaders dying like flies.

Some of the rules need to be house ruled to make the game flow better, if you implement some of these then the game rocks, my grade is based on the out of box rules though which is a solid 7, I would then add 1 point for the house rules I implemented.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very clever, very well thought-out design that works in so many ways, yet whose play is streamlined and therefore elegant. I'm not bothered at all by the rule that leaders may die on given rolls, thus leaving troops leaderless and having to remove them from the board. 

I suppose people who feel they like to control their decisions and see their intended strategies play out as they wish would be disturbed about this approach, but that rule strikes me as capturing the historical sense of the Hundred Years War. 

It's almost as though the game's a psychological test about one's level of tolerance of luck and randomness. Personally, I think the leaders dying off is fun: I laugh and say, "Oh, poor Richard, he got a cold, and he's gone--tough break." (I also get a great kick out of reading comments about a game about the Hundred Years War, stating 'This game's too long!') 

At the same time, the elements of sudden death and luck of the dice rolls can lead to wide swings of fortune from one turn to another, so that anything seems possible when one reaches the final turn, so there can be a high level of tension toward the climax of the game. Started playing in late November. 

Not that difficult to learn, as the rulebook is pretty well written, with useful diagrams and examples. Actually, the game reminds me of "Axis & Allies" this way, namely, that there are many steps to play to complete a turn, but they're laid out clearly, and you just follow them, trying to keep everything in mind. Not to overdo the comparison, but to me it's like a middle-weight version of A&A, but with some very clever additional mechanics. that repetitiveness, combined with its length, can be a bit wearying. 

That said, I concur with others who warn that it takes a long time to play, so one has to gauge the tradeoff between length of play and enjoyment. There are as many as 12 turns, and even after a half-dozen plays, solo, it was taking me 35 minutes per turn to complete--so you do the math.  

Purchased like-new copy, August 2012 and later sold, as I felt I had played it out as many times as I cared to, given my relative lack of interest in the period depicted.

RATING: 5
Rating may go up after more play, but seems to capture the difficulties of campaigning in this era, even apart from the high leader mortality rate (hehe!).  Not sure all the individual restrictions are valid (no breaking up stacks to transfer troops from one leader to another - huh?), but they feel right when piled up this way.  The leader death thing could be a little less draconian, but then when it did hit you'd really be stunned.  This way, you know to expect it.  Not for those who don't understand the period and want a quick, easy, action-movie bash.  

Stupid title, though.

New rating:  Dropped a point since I've tired of it. I don't find that the challenge of managing the chaos pulls me back to it.  Traded, doubt I'll replace it.

RATING: 6
Two player game of the wars between the English and Scottish Crowns with scenarios for the 12-13th Centuries with the Plantagenet Empire stretching from the Tweed to the Pyrenees and the Hundred Years War of the 14-15th Centuries. Each player gains two historical leaders each turn and one of two neutral leaders. These die off, but usually last a few turns and you try to win over provinces through combat, persuasion and siege. When you are 20 VPs ahead you win the game, otherwise the player with the most VPs at the end wins. I found the English leaders rather under-rated in the HYW scenario, so I add one combat to English King, which also acts as a balance as France is damned difficult to conquer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Deceptivley simple mechanics mask deep decision making and planning, which can all go to "Hell in a Handbasket" as one or more of your leaders dies off. The randomness may turn some off, but I love it as it ensures that no game will ever play out the same as the last one and forces you to stay on your toes. The components are first rate and the rules are well written with few ambiguities. I think I like the "Lion In Winter" scenario even better than the 100YW scenario even though that was my main motivation for getting WofG(!). Just a great game!

One play, unfortunately with one *major* oversight (we forgot about offering sieges on defense), and I'm excited about playing again. 
Update - started a new game, this time with sieges, and the game is much improved as a result.

A lot of the mechanics, such as dissolution of leaderless armies, make historical sense.

RATING: 9
A very enjoyable game that well captures the chaos and difficulties of the era. Some things to like.
The French generally have better bravery, but this is well offset by the English longbows and the commanders with greater bravery have fewer die rolls.
Leaders are crucial and the game balancing mechanism. 
They can die at the most inauspicious time. You find yourself looking at where you expect to lose leaders so you can deploy the next generation. 
Some leaders go either way and give you a decision do you start another front in Burgundy or Scotland or use the leader where you have your main forces. 
Leaders which can be killed, run away or captured can be ransom at the cost  of losing provinces (victory points). If left they cost victory points and you find yourself calculating will this guy die in captivity (and not cost VPs) or not.
Leaders are "locked" by opponents - you may send a force in a battle you know you will lose to keep your opponent from taking advantage of you elsewhere.

All in all quite a rich game with a lot of choices, where you have to manage your risk.

The rules are easy to pick up (quite coherent) and the game has good presentation.

Surprisingly enjoyable. Yes there's randomness due to leader elimination, but I find that thematic. Stray arrows, dysentery and drunken boating accidents did in fact kill some of the most important leaders of the day in entirely unheroic circumstances. A little bit of fussiness around re-enforcements perhaps, but otherwise plays quite smoothly.

  After immersing myself in this title just a few short times I find myself asking one simple question -- [i][b]how the hell did they do that?[/b][/i]

  Simple, tight, easy to learn.  The rules are damn near perfect.  The phase ordering provides such tremendous opportunities to each player to affect their position . . . it just boggles the mind that there is so much nuance in such a short rule book.  

  This is how it's supposed to work -- this is what games are supposed to look like.  Short simple rules providing vast avenues of options for players to choose from is the grail that game designers seek, and Warriors of God has taken such a huge step in the right direction that may have a measurable impact on the course of the industry in the light wargame genre.  I love how there is so much density in such a tight little package.

  Great action, theme magnificently supported by the rules, plenty of hard decisions, plenty of options (many of which only become apparent after many turns of play) plenty of risk, so much reward.  Battles can have dozens of possible outcomes, each providing its own intrigue, its own bend, its own affect on the bigger game.

  The pieces are ultra-plush and the larger print is a big plus for fading eyes.  The color coding, the heraldry, the iconography, all so beautifully put together, all so integrated into the gameplay, I just can't imagine how they could visually improve the components.  Just stunning in their usefulness without detracting from the art.

  Shakespeare is quoted throughout; the map is glorious; all is so beautifully produced.  Even the rules are an entertaining read.  Some leader pieces actually show paintings of the person from the era as their background.  As if all this isn't enough, the designers have taken care not to take things too seriously -- bits of levity slipped into the mix in just the right amount.  Just a home-run in so many ways.  

  In my estimation Multi-Man Publishing is the guy to beat now in the accessible wargame genre.

This is a great light wargame with euro crossover appeal.  The rules are very well written with plenty of examples.  The counters are nice and large, and the map is not busy.  The game play creates unique problems for each side and a dynamic strategy is important.  Excellent replay value.  

I really like the leader design and the death system works very well despite some randomness. This mechanic can be tough for new players but will become manageable with experience and once understood really becomes the strength of the way the game plays.  This is also the core of the replay value and strategic depth and decision making that makes the game work so well.

Halfway through my first game, and I have to say I'm a bit sorry I've overlooked it until now.  It is simple without being simplistic, and has an almost Miranda-like feel for chaos and narrative, but with much more subtle mechanisms.  The rulebook is a model of clarity.  Mahaffey's palette of browns is enhanced a bit here to great effect.  Overall a very pleasing package, with good replayability, meaty choices, crazy swings of fortune, and engaging play.

RATING: 6
Very procedural 2-player war game with buckets of dice. I don't have a problem with dice-resolved combat, and the leader-death dice-roll, though luck-infused, is interesting and thematic. But I do have a problem with dice being used in [i]everything[/i], especially for determining control of an area. Like Formula D's black die. You can't do anything. You just roll it.

Looks so luck-dependent, especially the leader-death and area-control dice rolls, but I do feel that the chaos can be mitigated by an experienced player. Some interesting asymmetry. Seems like they went for narrative over gameplay. You get a good narrative experience out of this game, but not so much satisfaction.

Gameplay can get repetitive (I wish the game were 8-10 turns instead of 12), but the new leaders every turn keep things fresh. Still, I really like the theme, and do want to play this some more.

I was caught out by a couple of ambiguities in the rules; so make sure you browse the rules forum before you play.

It takes a few plays to discern your mistakes from the background of chaos.  This is a game more depth than it first appears.

However after several plays I'm still having games where the dice leave me with no decisions to make.  This needs to shape up quickly or house rules will start appearing.

WoG like War at Sea meets the Hundred Years War. There may be some game who would not like it's luck element in combat and leader death but I think it works well for this game. Even though it is simple to play one still has to plan ahead. Should a three star leader fight or try to convert areas? WoG makes a good introductory wargame and fun for experienced ones, plays well solitare, rules seems to be written well, and nice map and counters. I didn't see anything I did't like. I hope there might be another one like it on a different subject. If I did't have one I would be robbin the hood to get a copy.

Fun, fun, fun!  Risk management is a key term here, as your leaders have to make a die check to survive another decade.  Some you hope survive for the maximum sixty years (six turns); others you hope die young.  Rank is very important - the higher your rank, the more troops you can haul around and the highest ranking leader in a space *must* be the battle commander.  But not all high ranking leaders are good fighters - some are downright lousy.  Simple mechanics, a bit chaotic (but risk management will mitigate all but the most extreme swings of luck), and mostly very fun.  A bit long for Eurogamers to get into, though the lack of complexity would otherwise make it a good wargame for them.

A very unique game with scenarios covering 2 separate periods of medieval fun between England and France.  Components are of fantastic quality, rules are well written and easy to grasp.

The gameplay is fun and at times infuriating.  It's all about chaos management. Try and grab the land before your leaders meet their makers, Try not to loose your troops when they eventually do.

With so many variables controlled by the fate of the dice no two games are the same.  However don't be fooled that there is no strategy in the game.

[gameid=23679] was one of our first (if the THE first) attempts at a wargame. It did not turn out so well.

The rulebook was easy to understand, even if there were many things to consider and we did have to look up a few things, but this was more to be certain than due to lack of comprehension. Our problem was that the game just didn't come to life for us. We stumbled around unsure of what to do nor how to do it.

The theme of the game lured me in - and it was present in our sitting. If it was historical I will never know, but it was intriguing. Unfortunately the way it played never made sense to us, the way armies moved, generals and combat. It was all a big dice-fest - not something that sat well with me - nor my wife.

I will not hold this against the game, it was more a misguided attempt on our part to play a genre that will forever elude us - or at least my wife. Granted, I did most of the stumbling but I do have an interest in getting into the genre, only to be denied at the first attempt by a game that left us in the dark.

Nice game. The chaos within reflects well the nature of medieval wars.

Bemol point about solo play : contrary to other players, I don't find it plays very well solo as the game has a chess-like quality, which means you are always trying to predict the reaction of the adversary at the next turn, so if you are playing against yourself, surprises are unlikely.

I like the game.  I like the chaos, because it forces you to throw away your battle plan and quickly develop a new one.  I like the era (to read about, I don't want to live in it) and the flavor.  I'm ok with the battle dice-rolling.

What I don't like is the upkeep, it gets tedious and easy to miss a leader.  So far the phasing still hasn't become intuitive after two plays (7 hours).

The genealogies of the time are so convoluted; there's an imbred irrationality to Europe this game exposes so very well.

Easy game that tells a story.  I wouldn't take it too competitively, but just enjoy playing it, as the dice can create some wild swings that aren't really easy to mitigate.

The main scenario is very good. The luck factor in the second one is too big as some key leaders can sway balance depending on which side they come.

A really nice looking war game about the One Hundred Years war (a period I am interested in).  The buzz definitely has me interested in this one!

Any game with Joan of Arc goes on my wish list.  Many complain about the chaos factor, but (since I'm more of an "alternate history" guy as opposed to a "strategy" guy) I think I would enjoy the game.

The map and box look great, but the game has too many die-dependent mechanics to allow much planning or strategy.

Nice game with plenty of variance for good replayability.  Components are serviceable and attractive enough.  Large counters make for easy play.  As usual, not nuts about paper map, but willing to deal with it.  Player aid is useful, though somewhat overwhelming.  As for the game itself, I think that it covers the feel of the war quite well.  You're very focused on the quality, age, and location of your leaders.  Situation can shift rapidly with even a single leader death, and with three or four every turn, you will find yourself constantly switching plans on the fly.  It's like trying to patch a first-sized hole in sheetrock using only nail putty.  The whole game seems kind of long and somewhat repetitive.  12 turns?  Really?  Am also somewhat concerned about the tendency for the game to sometimes swing wildly and irrevocably toward one player or the other.  A lucky start can leave the other player trying to catch up the entire game.  Still, I like this well enough.  Theme is great.  I'm a sucker for anything pre-gunpowder.  I only wish Enguerrand de Coucy was in the game, from Barbara Tuchman's history of the war, A Distant Mirror.

A nice take on the Hundred Years War in an area control format.  Large counters and a beautiful (paper) map are a nice touch. The rules are relatively easy for a wargame but make no mistake, this is a wargame.

RATING: 7
A good game, particularly for those of us with a high regard for the historic rivalry between France and England.  Some have complained about the luck factor.  To me this reflects the uncertainty of the period and adds a certain excitement to the proceedings.  Succession planning is key to dealing with this aspect of the game.

Very good light to medium weight wargame.  There is a lot of randomness in the game, so part of the decision making process is managing risk.  Your leaders will die and the will die at inopportune times.  Your job is to make it hurt as little as possible when they do die.

Great game. Wasn't necessarily into the period, but this game proved me wrong. I love how some of the mechanics in this game leave the player with some very tough, but subtle, decisions to make.

I have now played this game several times, both solo and vs real live human beings - four different ones.  It is a FINE game.  

I really like everything about this game - attractive components, simple to understand rules that do NOT mean the decisions in this game are simple, a very interesting historical period (the 100 Years War and earlier English-French dynastic struggles in the 12th/13th centuries), interesting game mechanics, Joan of Arc and Robin Hood too.      

Note: this game, like the period it depicts, is chaotic.  It is about trying to react to the unforeseen and to manage chaos.  Leaders WILL die (hey, these turns are TEN years long), troops will defect.  You cannot make a perfect chess-like plan.  But with skill and planning, you can to some extent immunize yourself from the vagaries of chance AND take advantage of new developments.

Leader death is unremittingly brutal.  Even if this models history, there has to have been a way to encompass that reality without breaking the game.

Reminds me a little of Hammer of the Scots, but I seem to like this better.

I enjoyed this game and I think there are many good things to be said about it. It is visually pleasing; the game mechanics in general work quite well and allow for a fairly fast-moving-game; despite the 'bucket of dice' combat system our games were full of very tense stand-offs and many battles went totally contrary to expectation; and the rules allow enough colour to provide a narrative and give a reasonably authentic feel to the game - in one of our games John Chandos was captured in Turn 1 and spent half a century in captivity because the English player did not want to lose any of his areas and poor old John refused to die, then he was finally exchanged just in time to die!

The two things about the game that stop me marking it higher are that it is a bit too chaotic, and, in my opinion, a little bit too imbalanced in favour of the English player.

The main chaotic element is leader death. I know that the turns are 10-years long and leaders could be expected to die at inopportune times, but an unlucky Leader Death Phase can be - and in one of our games was - effectively a game-losing event. Managing chaos in a game is all very well, but in this case the French were deprived of all their most powerful leaders while the English got off scot-free and ended up with 11 leaders in play including 3 3-star leaders.

I think the English have the advantage in terms of leaders - they have more 3-star leaders overrall and the ones they have seem more effective. The French end up saddled with Charles VI who has a Bravery Rating of 1 and can only roll 1 die, so he can only really contribute to the game by dying as quickly as possible. The English also have an advantage in that they can normally hope to control Scotland and Wales - the French can place leaders there but are unlikely to gain control for any length of time while the English control England. I don't think there are any regions in France that are so easy for the French player to hold.

This comment is based on just 2 plays, both of the Hundred Years War scenario. Maybe when I've played more I'll revise this rating, and I'll be happy to do that because I do actually think this is a very fun game.

It is probably my first boxed game that I am buying that early after publication. Well the quality of the components is excellent and the only miss may be a paper map, but then I would not spoil my pleasure for so little. The map and several markers are decorated with Shakespeare quotes, which is a nice touch.
The rules are short (16 pages) and a bit dry after the first reading. Everything becomes clearer during the first actual game turns and it turns out that the chapters were written in the most complete and organised way. It is a very nice job! So far I have not found any dubious interpretation problems and the various illustrated examples help a lot to figure out what it is all about. I am not quite a fan of the easy humourous touches throughout the pages (seriously, somebody knows about Maurice Chevalier at MMP?).

Played twice (one win, one loss as English, both games took about 5 hours each). Lots of interesting decisions here - which neutrals to recruit, where to place them, where to capture regions, where to fight... Starting first turn as the English reminds me of a chess opening - do you go for Flanders with its 3 rating or do you go for Brittany with 2 but then by sea to Aquitaine with its 3? If starting in Flanders, do you defend it or send your king to attack Brittany and send Chandos to control Aquitaine? Had the same feeling about exploring opening possibilities with Espana 1936 and I liked that game a lot, so bodes well for Warriors... Shame about the title though

With hardly any special rules, it's amazing how different each side and each scenario plays.

A game I preordered because of its topic. The good news is that it's a revelation: my best 2008 purchase (still waiting to receive my copy of Conflict of Heroes). Simple rules, lot of difficult decisions. This is not a game for control freaks or wargame purists. They will hate the fact that all their "strategies" may collapse with the sudden death of some of their leaders. But simple rules doesn't mean easy game. This is clearly not an euro. Highly replayable & fun.

Warriors of God is a game to be  played, not to be admired for it's take on history. I would rate this as about as historical as Crusader Rex or Hammer of the Scots. There is a certain flavor, but I doubt that You learn much about the period. As a game it plays easily, but is somewhat prone to randomness. You need to be able to put up with some odd twists and turns, but on the other hand it is possible to go from a poor position to a good position quite easily.

Vivir y morir, como la vida misma. Tan pronto como te has encariñado con uno de tus generales le visita la muerte y se lo lleva con él, pero te deja a sus desorientados soldados perdidos y sin otra opción que la deserción. O peor, que otro general enemigo más astuto los tome como suyos y golpee con tus fuerzas los muros de tu castillo.

Hay quién no puede pasar por tanto caos, pero representando la guerra de los cien años  difícilmente podría ser de otra manera.

El tablero es un obra de arte. Se tiran muchos dados y todos ellos ruedan precedidos de miles de plegarias entonadas por ambos bandos. Un juego para devotos sufridores que no os dejará permanecer sentados en ningún instante. Los dados se lanzan de pie, para poder caer de rodillas cuando aquél hombre del que todo dependía se ha ido a otra vida mejor.

Tras esto, incluso en los momentos más negros aparece un nuevo general capaz de cambiar el curso de la guerra a tu favor, sino que se lo pregunten a Juana de Arco...

Warning:  I may not know what I'm talking about here:  It seems to me that the 100 years war was pretty much a pointless waste of time for both France and England.  If that's true, then a game about a big waste of time seems like it will be a waste of time.  Nevertheless, the enticing painting of Joan of Arc on the cover makes me want to play it, maybe.

There are some interesting mechanisms here and they all come down to finding out the best timing. The pull and flip a tile adds a layer of timing: do you want to take the powerful action now, for a less powerful action next turn? The choice of which bait to cast adds further layers of timing: I want this fish, but will it be there when I empty out that portion of my player board? Figuring out your timing based on your player board, your opponents' player boards and the main board is a good concept. 

However, the game lacks an arc--you do the same thing every turn until it ends--and you are beholden to the various draws. You can influence your chances of winning through the various bonus tokens and by keeping an eye on what species your opponent(s) have grabbed. But in the end, the type and weight of the fish you somewhat randomly were able to catch typically decides the outcome, and you may not have been where the big ones were biting. For that reason, and others, this game actually manages to squeeze a bit of theme out of its euro-mechanisms, randomness and abstractness. Overall, this is a fun game as long as you aren't playing it too competitively and want something lighter/family friendly.

This game really caught me by surprise. The theme is a bit of a stretch but ultimately works. I like the mechanic... if not a little wonky; Place a disc to cast bait, retrieve a disc to cast more bait (and flip disc from 1 -2 or vice versa) or play a port option to get more bait or an angler card. Thats it and yet... there is a lot to consider and really becomes a game of timing. I enjoyed the trophy/achievement system and the allocation of awards a the end and felt as though it played strong to the games theme. The game does need house rules on certain items like placing a disc. I noticed during the game some of us got caught up in my planning and forgot where we placed a disc. From that point forward we agreed to place the disc next to the color, cast bait, remove disc, take action, then flip disc and move disc onto color at the same time. This avoided a lot of confusion as to who was doing what. The games ending really makes this game worthwhile as you weigh in only your biggest fish and maybe hope for a matching tag for an extra point. Simple, elegant, fun and a much needed theme entry. Well done.

Full disclosure - I am a friend of the designer.  That being said, I always worry about testing out things created by my friends (be it in the field of music, writing, photography, or whatever else), because I am very picky and also a little too honest sometimes.  I have no reservations whatsoever about recommending this game.  It plays elegantly, the basic cast and retrieve mechanism doesn't feel like anything else, and the challenge of optimizing your bait usage is very satisfying.  I can't think of a new game I've enjoyed more in the last few years.

RATING: 10
I HATE FISHING. But Brian Suhre's Coldwater Crown has made me love and appreciate the sport of fishing much more than I ever thought I would! This game is so much fun -- a great innovative twist on worker placement that completely works with the theme, and TONS of paths to victory. The solo play mode is a challenge, as I got SLAMMED by the dummy player on the first 2 solo games I played. This game plays fast, the artwork is beautiful, and the graphic design is a major step above what you normally see in many board games today. Even the rulebook is well designed and easy to read. I was able to read through it in about 10-15 minutes and have a solid grasp on how to play.

This could be taught to pretty much anyone at any skill level, and for that reason, this game stands out as a great puzzle mechanic game that could very well be a gateway game for many.

Really great game composed of 3 separate elements. Firstly it's a worker placement style in terms of actions with a nice variant of place one/remove one. Secondly you're playing a minigame in your tacklebox to remove different colored baits with the last one allowing you to collect a fish of a certain colour. Lastly the scoring is done with set collection. It's fun with a great looking board, interesting decision and it plays pretty quickly.

I like the originality of the competitive fishing theme...and that's about it. Players have tackle boxes (player boards) with bait of various, randomized colors in four sections. Two colors of bait align with each fishing area - the shore, the river, and the lake. Every turn, a player places their action token on an available color to remove one or more of that color from every section of his tackle box. Then, the player removes an action token from a different space and removes one or more of that color from every section of his tackle box. Alternatively, a player can place or remove an action token from a refill space that allows you to refill one or two of your tackle box sections with randomly drawn bait. You catch the fish in the region that matches the color of the last piece of bait removed in the corresponding section. Yes, this is 90% of the game - constantly removing and adding bait to your tackle box. Forget the rest of the game, if this in itself does not sound like an absolute blast, then this game is not for you (and I assume that would be most of you). 

For those who find adding and removing tokens from the same small board for 45 minutes to be fun, then read on! There are various trophies around the board that you can win for catching fish of a specific weight (random within a range for each kind of fish), fish with a certain color tag (utterly random), a set of three small breeds, 8 different breeds and 12 total fish, which is also the end game condition. As an alternative to refilling your tackle box, you can also select a "Grandmaster" card, where you can place discarded bait in certain color patterns to get another point and maybe another trophy or two with sets of these cards. You can collect 'tackle' tokens if you clear a certain section, which allows for some small manipulation of choices. I was constantly hoping to find ever more creative ways to clear my tackle box faster so that I could rush the game to its conclusion. There were none.

This game has a ton of high ratings, which is why I tried it out. I don't get it. I can't even begin to understand what people see in this. Neither could the 9 and 14 year old I played it with.

Good light-medium game, excellent to play with the family and a number of ways to generate points. Your strategy is a bit guided by the types of bait you receive but you can manipulate them reasonably well to time it right for the right fish. Great components and art.

This is a worker placement game where you are fishing.  You can place a disk on the 1 side to get any one color of bait off of 1 to 4 areas on the player board.  If you place on the two side you get all of that color off.  There is a part area that allows you to refill you bait or obtain a fish.  When you remove all your bait from one of the areas you get the fish from that area for that color.  There are various goals you can obtain similar to Thurn and Taxis.  You also compete at the end for biggest fish from an area.  

In general, I liked the game.  It is nothing knew but the theme is different.  It had a simple mechanic, but good choices.  I played a two player, and it seemed to overstay its welcome.  If it had been a bit shorter, I would have give it a seven.

Some really interesting mechanics and I could see after a couple of plays it would be some serious stick it to the other player opportunities.    After a bit of familiarity I don't see how it goes 90  minutes.   Two down-sides:  Set-up is kind of a bear for a game this  short.  Also, the fishing theme feels really pasted on.  While we did get to learn a bit about fish it really didn't feel like we were fishing at all.  This really felt like a marketplace/shopping game.

Coldwater Crown is my new favourite introductory Euro. It's very easy to explain and play. I also love worker placement games without rounds and this game flows so nicely from turn to turn: Place a disk (take an action), remove a disk (take an action). The beautiful artwork, well planned graphic design, and underused theme make it very engaging.

Action selection with a very interesting, unique feel.  Great theme and smooth gameplay.

Update: After a few more plays, I dropped my rating a tick.  I still really like the mechanical meat of this game, but feel that it just plays a bit too long for the depth, and there are too many turns where choices are all fairly underwhelming.  If the specific spaces I need are unavailable, or I could really benefit from doing the place/pickup in the opposite order, I'm out of luck.  The restriction just feels a bit too punishing for a strategy game.

What a surprising game... I did the KickStarter not really knowing what to expect from a 'fishing' game. But did the KS because my son is crazy about fishing and I am so glad that I did.
This is a fantastic fun game that anyone would enjoy, it has some great game mechanics around resource (bait) management and when and how to use them up to maximise watch you catch and the sort of combinations needed to get better scores.
It really is just a fun game that is simple to learn but has so many options on how to play each turn and for planning ahead.
Just can't recommend it highly enough for family or just fun gaming.
Having said that... if you are a hard core war gamer or need to truly kill things to enjoy a boardgame (not counting fish) then this may not be for you.

I have played both single player and a two person game types. Both types were extremely fun. I'm not a fisherman and still have a blast playing the game. At points it can get intense racing for certain trophies. Those moments shine. I played a print and play version which lacks graphics, but even that did not detract from the fun of the game.

The first tine setup can be a little confusing until you start to realize why certain things are labeled a particular way. After the first time setup, future play throughs become simpler in the setup phase.

It's a game about racing for limited resources, which come in the form of bait in this game. Fish are plentiful, but you must know when to catch the fight fish if you want to score well at the end of the game. One person could trigger the game ending condition with a lead in the scoring but lose zone everyone else gets a turn after the game end trigger. It can come done to the last turn where the score could change and someone else could be the victor. Some of the information on scoring is secret from other players, so you may not realize how close the score actually is until the end.

A fun take on the worker placement genre. I love the little bait bits and the tag challenge. 

It looks like a lot when you play, but is really easy to pick up. The strategy for winning, however, is much more difficult.

Not really into fish but this game place was easy and nice. I didn't find it complex at all, so perhaps too easy? For 2 players the game play dragged on far too long.

A unique application of worker placement mechanics.

At first the bait box can seem like a simple puzzle to solve in the most efficient manner...but then after you've lost the game you realise that the game is all about catching "the right fish" on the main board. Once the penny drops then application of the bait box becomes a real challenge.

An interesting worker placement game. Fun mechanics for placing workers similar to Raiders of the North Sea where you get the action of the worker you place, then you pick up a worker from the board and take that action as well. A decent amount of luck with the color of gems drawn from the bag and also the sizes of fish caught (although I guess that's thematic). I wish they would have made the front and back of the fish cards look more different. Some were flipped around and it won't get noticed until that card comes up. The tackle boxes are a new and interesting concept. I'd be happy to play this again if someone suggested it.

I find Coldwater Crown's implementation of worker placement/removal to be quite cleverly done. Perusing some other titles which utilize a similar mechanism (Raiders of the North Sea and its progeny) lead me to believe keeping the game space simple is where this mechanism can truly shine. This is a set-collection game at heart, with a race feel, and provides opportunity for some cool action chains in a single turn if all goes as planned. What hinders that aspect is that the game can be rather tactical at the full player count, preventing any concrete means of long term strategy. It also feels primarily solitaire (barring the race for achievements) and so excitement thresholds are kept to a minimum. 

(+) Novel use of worker "replacement" mechanism, combined with the special abilities for clearing your bait pool can lead to some great swing turns.
(+) Turns go by swiftly, game has a bit of tension in the race to collect certain sets.
(+) Beautiful production.

(-) Beholden to luck of the draw.
(-) Can become repetitive.
(-) Difficult to plan a consistent strategy, more of an opportunistic effort.

I love the theme - a fishing tournament where players compete to get the highest weight fish of various species from three geographical locations (river, lake and ocean shore). 

Once we got the hang of it, turns started going pretty quickly with limited AP. While not really a 'point salad' style game, there are plenty of ways to earn points .

This is a great foray into bigger boxed games for Bellwether Games! I love the theme and other than My Happy Salmon or Fleet don't know of many other fishing themed games.

This game caught me completely by surprise. Not only had I never heard of it before it released, I didn't realize I would be so excited to get to try a game about competitive fishing. It's a cool theme that as far as I know, has never been visited by a board game.

The gameplay is completely abstract. You fill a player board with randomly drawn plastic crystals that come in five colors and then spend your turns selectively removing groups of same colored crystals from your board. When you empty a space, you catch a fish from one of a few displays that are color coded to the crystals you discarded. What you catch is somewhat random, but there are a few "tackle box" abilities you can earn and spend to add a little more control over what species lands in your net.

The game is scored via a dozen or so different competitions all running concurrently. There is one for catching one each of the small species of fish, some for catching the most weight worth of fish at specific locations, races to be the first to catch a specific weight fish and another to catch sets of ocean fish, just to name a few.

It seems oddly disconnected to make a game about strategic fishing resolve itself via an abstract gem dropping puzzle game...but I have to say, it totally works. I guess maybe it is because plucking the gems off of your player board has a sort of quick and easy rhythm, much like casting a lure, over and over again. Or maybe I am just over-thinking it. I'm not sure, but I do know this was a lot of fun.

It looked interesting, but I read a bit of the rules and hated that Band of Brothers did it all better with less verbiage.  Realizing BoB would always get played first, I traded the base game and this as a packaged deal.

Another great module of LnL. Very few but significative modules rules. Melee combat is way more crucial than ever. Tactical movement according to the units you manouver is fundamental in order to get the most of terrain modifiers especially for Viet Congs. The scenarios are very immersive and do a great job in reproducing the guerrilla warfare of Vietnam. The quality of the components is exceptional, very outstanding. I think this is a great "preview" of Heroes of the Pacific, where jungles and mud will also play, I believe, a big role

"Squad Leader lite."  A good way to introduce both experienced and casual players to tactical-level wargames.  Moreover, a welcome alternative to Squad Leader if, on any particular night, you feel like a quick game that's lighter on rules and heavier on gameplay.  Overall, a cool game, but unsure if treating LOS stochastically ("sighting," according to the rules) is necessary or, for that matter, justified.

A solid, squad-level tactical game. Fast-moving, entertaining system. The system works particularly well for the Vietnam-era historical setting. Top-notch production values. I also appreciate that the Lock N Load system can be applied easily to more than one era - more scenarios to play with less overhead. Not overly complex, yet it still rewards good tactical application.

LnL is at its best with scenarios with around 5-15 units per side in relatively tight terrain and that makes Vietnam the best game in the series.

I picked up the second edition, because I like the original LnL quite a bit (not so much the WWII Band of Heroes followup). But LnL is chintzy as always - why doesn't this include ANZAC Attack? It was a small expansion, and really helped flesh out the game, including it in the 2nd Ed. would have made a much more compelling package.

All the LnL games area a little bit cheesy, but I always liked this one the best.
---
I like it a lot, but the rules are definitely rather rough. Could also use a little less attitude. Blog entry: http://homepage.mac.com/c_farrell/iblog/C2097221587/E1115236840/index.html

The events (a la Ambush!) are both a great strength and a great weakness of the game. I love how they add dynamics to the scenario, and generally think they are well done. On the other hand, they really kill replayability. If you're playing a scenario with events, and you've played before and your opponent hasn't, you really have to think about whether that's a good idea or not, and whether one side or the other might work. Otherwise, some of the events make some of the scenarios one-shot games.

Interestingly, LnL:FHV seems to me a more interesting game that its successor, LnL:Band of Heroes. I'm not sure why, but the WWII incarnation seems much gamier than the Vietnam version. LnL:FHV does have oddities as a system, but while they don't bug me much here, they seem to get grossly amplified in BoH.

The rules were rather wooly, and I wonder how much replay there is in scenarios once the Event chit results are known. But I am not sure I was playing it correctly so this is provisional.

I love this series, and this is just another great one. The era is unique, and well implimented. The game is fun and tense, and one of the few games I enjoy playing solo. 
The rules are a little thick, but I have enjoyed the challenge of it. Once you get how it all works its not so bad. I really like how many optional things there are for me to do when I am playing.

RATING: 7.5
After only one playing, I think this is a really good game, certainly the best tactical system to come out in a long time. I've played it twice so far. Unlike what petermc wrote, the system is NOT "basically shoot/shoot back with frills", it's quite a bit more innovative and interactive. The "frills" (chrome) are represented using scenario-specific cards, so unlike most wargame systems you don't have to learn rules that don't apply to the scenario you're playing. My only concerns are that the rules could be better, and I'm not sure if the scenarios I've tried are really balanced. But there are a lot of subtleties to playing well, so maybe with experienced players they are balanced.

This is a good game, but due to complexity of the rules - and the fact that I have to teach them to others - I never got beyond basic vehicles.  A terribly written rulebook doesn't help.  Interesting looking scenarios.

Haven't got a whole lot of plays in yet, but my handful of games have been very enjoyable.  Does a great job of simulating the ebb and flow of jungle firefights.  Just the right mix of detail and simplicity.  Rules could use some clearing up in a couple places - hopefully the upcoming release will help in that area.

The game is easy to pick up and play and it’s fun to see a non-WWII small unit theme.   It also plays quickly with generally realistic results.  However, the game isn’t cheap, the graphics are not as great as advertised, the maps could have been double-sided, the player-aids are sub par and the rule book could use an index and better organization.  Also, some of the scenarios appear slightly unbalanced and I am troubled about replayability since once you play a scenario you know the surprises contained therein and can alter your play accordingly the next time.  I hope the Falklands expansion happens.

LocknLoad is a game big on FUN small on complexity.  LnL gives players a great gaming experience. Tactics matter and amongst some of the things u need to keep an eye on are using cover, fire & movement and decisions...thinking about them and making them-gameplay is fast and furious and your decision making is made to fit the pace of the wonderful impulse/turns mechanics that the whole game is weaved together with. I think, having played the game, i can say is that you won't be disappointed if you want gameplay that is fun and intense as the tactical situations it represents.

Love the system.  Lots of FUN.  Not mad about the thin pieces though.  Also, "mounted" board here means, stiff cardboard board, like deluxe GMT games.  Great artwork though.  I really like the mystery stuff on the back of the scenario cards, though I wonder if that limits replayability.

RATING: 7
A good fun squad-level wargame. The Vietnam War setting gives it a unque offering compared to the (A)SL(SK) series. More easily accessible than the (A)SL(SK) stuff, if the rulebook was better organised! The rules are all over the place - very messy. The events do give the game a lot of flavour and turns it into a more RPG-like experience, as opposed to the tactical exercise that is (A)SL(SK), and that can be fun. But the events also seriously mar replayability.

This is a tough rating.  I see the quality of this design, and the few run throughs of this title I have worked through have all been intriguing.  The problem though is I don't think I am of the type that really wants to get down to this level of squad tactics.  this is definetly not the deepest and most wrapped in minutae of all these style of games, but it's more effort than i request for a boardgame.  Regretfully I rate this a 5, not for it's design but simply my compatability with the product.  For this type of game I prefer the chrome, and streamlined ease of Tide of Iron.  If the ratings were based more on my opinion of the design rather than a mix between that and my wantingness to play it would easily be an 8.

Complexity but not complicate - that is the keyphrase why I eagerly awaited the final release (and actually the endless shipping over the ocean) of LnL.
If you want Squad Level Action without fiddly rules but depth, I really urge you to take a look at the free Demo of it! If you also don't mind to see a different theatre beside Ardennes or Stalingrad, you have to sniff how good and gamey NAM can be.
That seems really to be the game I have been waiting for a damned long time!

Really fun squad-level game that is more realistic, faster moving, and more fun than Squad Leader.  The game covers some aspects of small-unit combat very well, such as the disadvantage of opening fire because you give up your position.  However, the game completely misses out on other important aspects, such as the advantage of opening fire in the direction of an enemy position to force them to keep their heads down.  There is no "covering fire" here, everything is either hit or miss.  The game essentially combines the good parts from Squad Leader, Platoon, and Ambush! into one package.  Unfortunately, the weak parts of Squad Leader (melee, machine guns) make it in here as well, in almost identical form.  You may at times find your intelligence insulted by the game; for example, the game's graphics are certainly not the "best ever in a wargame" as the box contends.  And there are a fair number of errata issues, particularly on the counters.  The game could really benefit from solitaire, campaign, and design-your-own scenario rules.  Despite the warts, I'd still rate it the best squad-level system available.

Great game...As Far as the Rules quality issue that a lot of people are bringing up: I agree, this is a simple game,but the less formal structure of the rules makes finding the key modifiers and stuff hard to find---Solution? Download a Play Aid Card, and this game almost plays itself!

Play aids should be mandatory with ALL games that have modifiers for standard procedures.
Why should we have to continuously reference the rulebook to find out the modifier to the to hit table for a moving bazooka shot?
Designers take note- this game has Very well written rules, but the overall impression is negative, because it is organized in a loose way that makes looking things up difficult, and didn't include a player aid card.

prefer Band of Heroes

RATING: N/A
I've played an enormous amount of this and what can I say? - I love it!  The impulse system reflects the difficulties of mounting an attack and encourages holding reserves for the later part of the turn.  The combat system, once you get a hold of it, is very easy and intuitive - you'll never look at the tables again after your first game.  Vehicles, helicopters and other chrome all slip neatly into the existing system without overwhelming it.

Q&A does exist, particularly regarding the line of sight rules.  If you think in miniatures terms, they'll work better for you.  The model also makes it a bit too easy to exhaust defensive fire, but this comment is more from a simulations viewpoint than a gameplay one.

With the spotting rules, events and counter replacements for half-squads, it feels clunky. It combines elements of ASL, ATS/Panzer Grenadier and Squad Leader, but seems to miss the excitement of the other series.I dislike the combat resolution mechanism of the attacker and defender dicing off against each other and the damage determined by multiple of the defender's morale.

RATING: 5.5
Not too keen on the Hollywood fantasy presentation of the conflict, and "heroes born under fire" gaining skills out of nowhere. A bit too fiddly system here and there with the dice-offs between attacker and defender over a single volley of fire, and the numerous ops complete and other counters laid over stacks (they should be smaller than the squad etc. counters) so you can't see conveniently who's who. The event markers in some scenarios cause imbalance, unless both players either have or haven't played it before, so that hinders replayability a bit. There's plenty to play though before that happens. It's not all bad and can be entertaining also, traded away but will try gladly more plays on Vassal.

...aaand received again in a MT along with the ANZAC Attack expansion :)
Let's give it another chance.

RATING: 7
I've played a lot of this lately as my wargame buddies and I search for a better Squad Leader.  "Better" in this case meaning quicker, more fun, and easier to teach newbies.  LnL is slightly quicker than SL.  Is it more fun?  Well, it's different....the spotting mechanics in particular give the ebb and flow something that does not exist in SL - and that is fun.  Easier to teach?  It would be if the rulebook did not have so many holes in it.  Many questions arise...even about rather basic concepts.  The other main negative is unrealistic units.  Armor, helicopters, and heros are too simplistic and are out of whack.  We have made some house rules to address these issues, but the whole point of playing this game was to avoid a lot of rules!  Overall, LnL is a bit of a mixed bag for me.  I look forward to a rewrite of the rules (which I hear is coming soon) and new modules.  I believe the system has great potential.

The above is a very old comment (when the 1st edition came out - maybe 2004?).  While I have not revisited the system, from what I've heard it is improved.

RATING: N/A
A general aversion to tactical level squad-leader-like game.  The system is too heavy-diced.  It could be a good game and internal mechanism for a PC game, but well, not for a good war boardgame.  Try the demo or play it over the internet first before you decide whether to like it or not.

I've played many tactical hex and counter games since the days of the original Squad Leader. I've never run across a game that I've enjoyed as much as SL so I've always gone back to SL (with COI for armor). Until I started playing Forgotten Heroes. This game is every bit as fun as SL and it plays fast. It is also a much more enjoyable system for solo play. I've since purchased Heroes of the Blitzkrieg and Heroes of the Gap. I've also preordered Band of Brothers Normandy and Heroes of the Pacific. This is my new favorite squad level tactical system. Learn the rules for one game and you've learned them all of the games.

Forgotten heroes uses an impulse system and many of the scenarios include random events (adding to replay value and fun solo play). LNL is a fantastic system and Forgotten Heroes is a wonderful introduction to the system. You owe it to yourself to give this a try.

Really liked the system; quite innovative and interesting.  But the game suffers from "game marker overload", which is one of my pet peeves.  Five minutes into the game, and you're looking at clusters of "Ops Complete" and "Fired" markers, none of which are color-coded so you don't even know which units are yours.  Just ruined the whole thing for me.

Very solid game, especially given that many of the combat resolution mechanics are unique.  Graphically excellent, with massive counters.

1st Ed.: Rules need work. Not as detailed as SL/ASL. Most of the scenarios are good, but a couple of them are very unbalanced. Raised the rating after several solo plays. The rules summary available on line helps immeasurably. The components are very good. 

2nd ed.: LnL is now my favorite tactical game system. It has the right balance of chrome, playability, detail, and variety of scenarios and settings, without breaking the bank. The 2nd edition of Forgotten Heroes is a beautiful production, far better than the first, and one of the nicest in the series. The refinements of the rules make the game a lot better since the early days. Finally got to play FtF for the first time and dam', this game is even better with a live opponent. Although no game ever reaches perfection, this one comes darn close.

Attempted to go deep into this, but only managed to get through a few scenarios. It's the rules. The rules are very confusing and hard to internalize. I think the game is probably pretty good once one has a good grip on the rules. I'll probably want to get it going again in the future.

I have just played my first game of Lock'n'Load and I've been a little bit disappointed by it. Not that this is a bad game, not at all, it's just that it didn't live the hype I heard about it. It's a neat, fine system... but the fast playing time is mostly due to the low counter density (I can play many ASL scenarios in under 3 hours time, expecially when no armor is involved, terrain and los rules are less than stellar (read: I don't like them), and the "no-tables-needed combat" isn't that much an improvement over, say, ASL tables (I can figure out of memory the majority of common results of the IFT anyway in ASL, since it follows a very logical progression, so the system used in L'n'L plays in a not-so-different way (you still roll two dices and apply similar modifiers...). the impulse system is something I'm still unsure of... I liked it in pure AFV fights in Adv. Tobruk but I still think it's much more harder to plan with such a system when you play out infantry fight.
What I really didn't like in L'n'L is the melee system, expecially the whole "melee against shaken = auto kill" thing...
From these impressions you could say I didn't like L'n'L at all, while in reality I found it a fine game... only not the masterpiece everybody was raving about. It's a tactical game that tries to be less fiddly and complicated than many other tactical games out there, and it partially manages to do so... it's much easier to play L'n'L than ASL, but it's not in the same league when it boils down to pure fun. It surely is a good intro game to tactical games, and it surely it's a game that needs some different thinking in handling than many other tacs out there due to the impulse system... but, right now, I'd suggest a newbie to buy the ASL starter instead of this. Rules are not that harder nor that longer, but you end up knowing a system much more rewarding. Reccomended, but right now, with some reserves.

My son and I just finished playing the first 2 scenarios recommended in the first section of the rule book. WOW! What a blast! A solid 8... which may increase once we get more scenarios under our belts. A nice flashback to SL, with smoother play. Only had to check the rules once in awhile and after a few checks into the tables you will only have to reference them with some unique occurance. A nice Nam flavor through and throughout. Well worth the price of admission. 

We have the expansion pack, and will be adding it to our play after a few more scenarios with the base game. The VASSAL CD-ROM that comes with the game installs easy enough, but I have yet to encounter anyone online to see how the games plays via the internet. Still, I prefer the face-to-face aspect of wargaming. 

After more playing ... I have got to raise the rating on this one ... 9.5 !!! and get the expansion ... the expansion cost more $$$ than I think it should have ... and no corrections to the marker errors from the base set (what a disappointment there) ... but the bits and pieces are of high quality. ... 

Back again ... I have never done this before ... but after playing more scenarios ... I am coming back an increasing my rating for this one a second time! 9.9 all the way! IMHO ... The best tactical wargame out there! ... 

May 25, 2007 and ... Back again ... after several years and many games ... I finally have to admit this one is a definite 10  !!! If you like this one ... you will like Combat Commannder also.

A great addition for tactical wargaming. The maps and counter art are great.  The rules are very clean, but have a few instances where they are subject to player interpretation (has yet to cause me any gaming issues).  Overall the rules are short, easy to navigate & cover the major aspects without killing you in detail other tactical games have, add national flavor for all forces (US, USMC, ARVN, VC, NVA).  Game play moves quick and forces you to act as a tactical commander (use of support weapons, reserves, etc...).  Individual leaders and personalities (medics, snipers, heros) factor highly as they would in small unit actions and are aided by cards assigning individual traits / abilities.  Great game.

A good game, but not for everyone... rules are not very well written and the system is not as simple as the designer claims.
I've had some very tense very good fights with this one, and I do like the gameflow overall, but I just can't find opponents often enough.
Not a fun solitaire experience.

Its a fun and interesting game. The rules are a pain in the ass, quite counter intuively structured and serveral information about the same topic scattered through out the hole manual. It took some time to get aquqainted to the rules but once you grasp the concept it plays very well.

After reading Matterhorn (Karl Marlantes), I was eager to find a tense, tactical-level Vietnam game, and FH delivers. Rating is based on the first play, but I've enjoyed Band of Heroes using the same system. Mechanics feel right for this setting--lots of hard decisions. components (players aid, module rules, maps) are at least as good as other recent offerings, though the die cutting was a little light forcing me to recut most before punching them. At first read, the scenarios seem well balanced.

As an ASL player, I was looking forward to a simpler game to ease some of my friends into squad level wargames.
First impression is that the game is hugely overhyped.  Expect this publisher to lie to you in their advertising.  The graphics are nice but not the greatest ever that is what is claimed on the box.  Likewise the rules are smaller than ASL but still very hefty compaired to non-wargames.  The rules could use some work.  A couple of times I could not find an answer to a question. (Can each unit in a stack roll for spotting, or just one?)  Also the organization of the rules was poor.  Some rules are tough to find.  I did not have too many problems since I knew ASL (if I could not find a rule I did it the ASL way), but I suspect a newcomer would find things pretty tough.  They needed a blind test for the rules.
Having said all that, the game is fun.  It is not just a simplified ASL, they have innovated in a few ways.  The special powers for the leaders is fun, and the surprise paragraphs that are triggered when certain game events happen are clever (tho the replayability of the surprise is limited so you will have to find new scenarios online).  Overall, a well put together game with some flaws.

Four solo plays of the Friends in Need scenario. It's fun but with a steeper learning curve than I'm used to. I think this would be a very fun two player game and I'm very hopeful it'll work solo in the long run as well. It tells a very exciting narrative as gameplay moves forward.

WOW, 2nd edition is absolutely beautiful and extremely well produced!  Lock N Load has become my goto post WW2 wargame system. My only complaint is the maps, there beautiful, but claustrophobic, and the "city map" only has a few buildings. As a result, the battles just don't feel epic.

(1st edition) A solid, very playable title that looks good, too. Repetitive Events can hamper replayability. I'm also dubious of a few of the scenarios. 

Still, this one keeps calling me back. Very evocative with wonderful period 'feel'. Several of my best gaming buddies enjoy it a ton. Good, clean fun.

V.3 core rules are much better.

This is the first release that launched the entire Lock and Load series, and it deserves high marks - I think the game borders on being a classic.

The designer charges stores a stiff amount to display this game, and with profit margins being a retailer's greatest persuader, this game may just not show up on store shelves the way it should.  It's a beautiful wargame, though, with a clean combat system, low tile-density.  Lives up to the hype.

The Lock'N Load system is one of my favorite tactical scale wargame. I enjoy the impulse system that oblige you to consider each action has a potential domino effect situation. It is not my favorite era but the subject is not treated in many other games of this scale. And the helicopters bring a lot of new kind of situations.

RATING: 6.5
Slightly better than Band of Heroes.  OK, but mechanics not nearly as good as Conflict of Heroes or Fighting Formations.  The fighting and damage series of rolls made the game less intuitive and slower without really adding any value.  Spotting rules also slowed the game down and made it more frustrating.  Not being able to rally broken units without a leader, made it painful with low leader scenarios when they were wounded early as did getting wounded if there were not any medics in the scenario.  The game mechanics also seem to reward just sitting in cover and firing rather than making assaults - it may be realistic, but it leads to boring play.

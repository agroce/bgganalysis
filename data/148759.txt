Un jeu de deckbuilding moins technique que Dominion mais tout aussi fun , avec beaucoup de combinaisons possibles. Peut-être un peu long.

Worst Deckbuilder I have played.  I rate games based on Monopoly (played correctly) being the average of 5.5.  Would I rather play Time Masters or Monopoly?  I'd rather play Monopoly, but just barely.  Really I'd rather play one of the 20+ better deckbuilders.

Given that there aren't many comments, I'll post a quick summary. Thoughts based on a few plays on boardgamearena. It's a deckbuilder, so I'll explain in Dominion terms to some extent.

-Actions and money are rolled into one  (spells). Each time you play a spell, you increase your buying power and carry out an effect (draw cards, trash cards, gain cards, attack effects, etc.)

-"Ke" is what lets you play spells, but rather than starting with exactly one every turn and having to generate more with action cards, you start with four and have to skip turns or discard cards to regen Ke, or play "focus" cards.

-Cards are laid out in five stacks ("Spheres of Consciousness) that cost 1-5. All cards are worth points = purchase cost. Each deck is shuffled and you can buy the top card of any stack you can afford, or overpay to take the second (unknown) card from any deck. Purchases go to your hand.

-Timers are the main wrinkle in the system, though they are reminiscent of duration cards in Dominion. Essentially, you play a timer for free to your timer area, and can then play a spell to it by paying its cost, but leaving it to resolve on a future turn. Each card on a timer is available to be played for free at any time. If a timer has its maximum alotted spells (usually one or two) you have to blow it up and commit to resolving all the spells on it that turn (you can choose when to play them) or start tossing cards from your hand to further delay it. You start with one timer, and can buy better ones that have special effects. Adding to the complexity, you can choose to "delay" timers that are full by throwing additional cards under them in order to keep their text active and/or postpone resolving an effect. 

-Decisions in general can be tough. You have to balance getting high-point cards with cards that work with your deck. There are some decisions oustside of the buy phase, such as skipping turns fo Ke and loading timers. Also, reshuffle management is pretty important due to the number of cards that interact with the discard.  

-There can be a lot of variance given shuffle luck of your own deck, plus the shuffle luck of the Spheres. Many of the more expensive cards are VERY swingy -- opponent skips a turn, steal a random card from opponent's deck, etc.

Du deckbuilding où on ne joues que Storm. Ca tourne completement à vide, c'est ultra brimant (on joue des messe à 2 qui raportent 1). Il est possible qu'on ai sous joué la méchanique de temporisateur.

Nice deck building with original concept: K and time management.
It miss players interactions: you almost don't care what your opponents is doing.
No real fight between players, so your wife may love that.

Tried once at Essen. The "time"-tokens provides an interesting concept but I felt the card buying mechanic was  way too random. It felt more important to buy the best possible card when you were allowed to buy, instead of buying a card that worked well in your deck. Seems like a missed opportunity for what could have been a good strategic deck-building game.

Disclaimer: This was only the second deckbuilder which I have played (I think), after Dominion. It isn't entirely my genre, and I can not really compare it well. But for those who love that kind of game, Time Masters should offer quite much. The first fifteen minutes we were fishing in the dark (especially when it came to the use of the timers) - my wife was actually asking whether we could stop playing this. But I asked her to continue, and it did grow on her (and on me) in the course of the game. In the end we agreed to keep it and give it another try in the future. 
The game is well-designed, and the cryptic timers do serve a purpose when it comes to gaining cards from higher spheres (which are more or less inaccessible in the earlier rounds). I liked this concept, and it is the main reason I would like to play the game again. 
There was some small confusion during the setup as one of the cards in the starting setup actually has a different name than mentioned in the rules, and the end conditions (count victory points on all cards you accumulated during the game) could have been clearer, but all in all, the English rules teach the game well. 
All in all, this is a solid game that should appeal to people who are fond of deckbuilders and is good enough for me to want to try again.

Good game with original ideas for deck-building mechanism.
Discovered it with a friend, and then bought it to play with my wife or some friends fans of Magic.

Колодостроительная. Маги, время вместо денег. Сыграли пока 1 партию в "рваном" режиме (дети постоянно отвлекали). В отобранных для игры картах оказалась куча таймеров. Сперва не поняли как их использовать тактически, потом разобрались. Будем ещё играть и разбираться.

The game brings a lot of innovation to the deck building genre. But it doesn't feel completely finished. i don't have the feeling that strategic planing is rewarded. Also the option not to buy the top card seems rather unattractiv. The game has potential but it should have some guidance by an experinced publisher.

Some great ideas and well-adapted high level theme...combined with clumsy execution and bland spells. Note: Rating upped from 6 to 7 after 3rd play.

Nothing really wrong with this game, it just doesn't have enough fun features to stand out among other countless forgettable deckbuilders. In a world where Dominion, Star Realms and other good deckbuilders with clean design and cool features exist, I don't see myself choosing this one.

This game is our favorite deckbuilding game for me and my wife.
We used to play a lot to Ascension and Dominion but now that we bought this one, we left these two in the bottom of our board game chest :).

The "Ké" system and the way we can combine our cards is quite easy to understand but very hard to master!
This is the primary reason why we love this game. Plus the heavy pleasure we feel when we can combo and play more than 10 cards in a row!
Compared to Ascension for instance, we realllly like the fact that we can (but not must) bother the other players by playing highly expensive aggressive cards (they can really annoy your opponents, but the heavy cost you may have to pay, will automatically balance the game).
There is a lot of way to play Time Master, including aggressive or rushing...etc.
Its a quite awesome deckbuilding game, I recomend it.

deck builder with some interesting twists ... but it didn't grab me

[+] managing the Ke(s) and using temporizers offer some new layers of gameplay in a deckbuilder*; 
the more spells you use the better card you get could be interesting...
[-] BUT there's only one card to choose from (in each level), so if the card is crap/not good for your deck, you have to rely on luck... 
*in the end, it felt less about building your deck (by getting cool cards, getting rid of crappy ones, focusing on draw/kes/etc.) and more about managing your Ke(s) to be able to use (get rid of) all of your spells to get a good card; and repeat...

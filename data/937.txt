A slightly cut down version of the original 1829 and although it may indeed be improved, I still prefer the original I think. Much more gentle and not as cuthroat as most other 18xx games but a good introduction to the genre. The other units make it playable with more players though

Very badly written rules combined with ridiculously complicated gameplay with stupid tiles and lots of non-events makes this a no-replay-game.  Don't bother.
The fact that it's related to the fine 1830 does not seem to help.

+ Shorter than most 18xx. Much more focus in tile laying screwage than in stock shenanigans. I do like tile laying screwage.
- But I do miss the stock shenanigans, and the lack of it makes this game much less interesting than the ones in the other branch.

Two playings, Unit 1 base kit only.  My group is an experienced 1830-style (26/56/70/EU) group, 1825 took us fully half a game to get the strategic concepts in hand - hated until then, somewhat admired thereafter.  Especially popular were the stock movement rates for increased income/price ratios, disliked was the 2 dimensional market and the lack of basic track.  Short length (3 hours in my group) but still with the depth of play expected in an 18xx a major plus.  This game will become a playable  part of our 18xx repertoire; it may not see as much play as 18EU but is probably more likely to hit the table than 26/30/56 at this point.

RATING: 6
(I've played with a few expansions, not sure which... it had Unit 2, plus some strange companies with U3 trains, etc)

Presents a kind of dilemma: it's a much better game with the expansions, but it's also a much longer game. With that time, I'd rather play something of the 1830 branch. I do see that this is focused on something totally different, but I much prefer the other focus. There's no tension in this game, I almost feel like I'm playing an eurogame. A long, ugly (but, I admit, deep) eurogame.

RATING: 7
An 18xx game of the linear stock market lineage. Good in that it can easily be played in 3 hours, even by inexperienced players like us! I prefer the stock market shenanigans and depth of the 1830 line, but this is one that I would like to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Have yet to play Unit 1 but having played Units 2 and 3, I'd say it's an excellent example of the 1829 line.  Stocks only go down if dividends are held.  Multiple jump ups are allowed and as I recall, there are no forced train purchases as companies can go into insolvency and receivership.

RATING: 8
First play w/4 players and it was ok. A solid 9.
Second play w/3 players and we had to stop. Maybe it is not the correct number. Lack of tension or decisions. Grade down to an 8. Bit dissapointed. Seems you need to play with other units in order to really enjoy the game.

RATING: 8
I can see why some 18xx players wont like this as much as other 18xx games.  The timing instinct that you have to develop in games like 1830 is useless here as suddenly it isn't the train timing you're worrying about, it's the stock purchase timing! After playing Unit 2+3 I'm thinking that adding Expansion K3 is a must if playing 1825 as the grey tiles and 7 trains (with the resulting obsolescence of the 3 trains) is an absolute must.  I also like the larger stock track in unit 2.

Very surprised by the rather low average rating, I must admit - judged on its own merits, and not expecting it to be like 1830, 1856, or the other really big 18xx games, this is an excellent game. Module 1 (South) is best with 3 (that's the number of "big" companies). With that number, I like this one a lot as it's short and straightforward - the essence of the 1829 branch of the family in a highly playable package. One of the things that I like about the 1829 side of the 18xx family is that the stock market is actually interesting as players will fequently juggle their portfolios to try to optimise their holdings, while in 1830 and its kin the stock market tends to be stagnant once people understand the loot-n-dump threat. Talk of 1825 as an "introductory" 18xx sells this game short - it's an excellent game judged on its own merits, and may in fact be the overall best in the genre.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly subtle perfect information game.  Very obviously not a German game or a game in pursuit of the German design genre.  The game mostly exists in your head in the number space that represents the various companies and their potential futures.  The economic system has strong "waterbed" qualities (push down here, pops up somewhere else) which would seem to make run-away leaders difficult, but in fact almost masks them from view.  Very interactive in this regard.  

This is a timing game: it is all about owning the right shares at the right times.

Appears very replayable, and again in a rather un-German way due to the subtlety of the waterbed qualities rather than the emergent depth of the rules.  

Beware: Tile choice for the track tiles is astoundingly short/tight for yellow, green and russet

The regionals and their minor companies do a lot to balance and extend the base game in interesting and useful fashions.

Rating is a first impression. I think I probably prefer the 1830 family rather than the more stock-portfolio intensive 1829 family (such as 1825). 

We played only Unit 1, and with 4 players and a small add-on. I think 3 players is probably the max...and I suspect Unit 1 is probably not really that strong as a solo product anyway. 

I'm looking forward to trying it again, most likely in connection with one of the other Units. Rating could rise. If it works better, but I still find the stock manipulation too tame, it would probably rate an 8. Its a nice variation in the 18xx world (which I've been sucked into quite a bit).

RATING: 3
I like a tight economic system -- heck, I love Age of Steam.  But the limitations in this game are so ridiculously arbitrary.  Why are there no shallow arcs with small stations?  Why so few 5 trains?  Why can't we sell stock directly to other players?  The result feels unnecessarily constraining and scripted.  A friend once commented that there is something fundamentally wrong with a game if it has money in both one and five hundred denominations, and that is true of this game, making the math involved mind-numbing and again, arbitrary.  In our game, I came in second, and not even a distant second; everyone at the table was surprised, none more than me.  I had no business finishing so well, and thus something, SOMETHING, must have been wrong.

Players invest in railway companies, with majority shareholders becoming company directors.  Players alternate with share dealing rounds (buy/sell shares in companies) and operating rounds (running the companies).  Companies develop railway networks on the map of northern England and Scotland, purchase trains, and run those trains over their routes.  Running a train generates income which can be paid out to shareholders (increasing share price) or held by the company for future expansion (decreasing the share price).  Quite a simple rulebook disguises a rather deep and cerebral game.... and 1825 is considered one of the lighter 18xx games.  If you want to dip a toe in the 18xx waters, this is probably a good place to begin.  Can be bolted to 1825 Unit 2 for a larger game.

Played this once, but absolutely loved it.  I'm always a sucker for train games, and this was one of the best I've played - even though this is as much (or perhaps more) of a stock game than an actual train game.  It's also strangely cooperative - you usually have a big enough stake in everyone else's companies that you want to make sure they do well.  Would love to play tihs, or any other 18XX game again.

These games are just too long to get to the table often enough.

One should always bear in mind these are more of a game system and game kit than a game in themselves (at least this is true for the 1825 games).  Player numbers should dictate what you use; chances are if you don't use the right combination somebody is going to be very bored while everybody else runs a company.  Trust me, I've seen it; although to be fair it wouldn't bother me much.

Unit 1 is the basic unit you should be playing, with at most four players and preferably three (IMHO).

Small no-frills 18xx. The small map and the scarcity of tiles make track-building very important here and you will often find that what you need has already been taken. The stock market is pretty simple and fairly static but still a deciding factor. It's all about timing when to buy which shares and dump others.

The modularised version of the venerable and flawed 1829. An unexpanded Unit 1 really only works for 3 players as there are 3 'big' and 3 'small' companies. The rules aren't by any means complete or unambiguous, which is pretty alarming given that this game originates in the 70's. Track tile shortage can be acute here, creating a very different emphasis from other games in the series. Unit 1 has quite a scripted feel as only LSWR and GER shares are issued in parallel, so some Region Kits and Minors are essential to shake things up a bit. Oh, and the SECR really is hopeless, it should have been the sixth company rather than the fifth in the share issue sequence (it was that way round in 1829). Overall this is a useful 'baseline' to the 18xx system and the 3-4 hour playing time is pretty much ideal.
My rating: This Unit:7, With Kits & Minors:8, Combined Units:10.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

RATING: 7
Very nice, smallish and quick 18xx game. Most of the share manipulation nastiness from 1830 has been removed here, which results in an emphasis on track building. Timing of share purchases is still important though, thanks to the fixed order the companies are sold in, and it is possible for a player to get severely locked out of the action.

I am disappointed with the physical components. The plastic discs that are used for tokens are much inferior to the cardboard tokens found in Avalon Hill's or Mayfair's games, and the absence of a small mat for each company to hold its various assets is quite annoying. Other than that, components are good though.

I've come to the conclusion that the 18xx series is just not my cup of tea. This game in particular seemed pretty limited in rail development and it didn't take long to see who was out of the running early. 

I have not played with the expansion sets to this game which are supposed to enhance the game.

Great business idea, split 1829 into three and have three new games. Maybe that's not quite it, but it's certainly close. I'm probably in the minority but I prefer the 1829 branch of 18xx to the 1830 branch. To me the 1829 games are railway games with a stock market, where the 1830 games are econmic games with  a railway theme. I prefer building a rail network to trying to wreck someone elses.

Unit 1 is Southern England, with the West Country and part of East Anglia missing. London is the highest value station on the board so usually a race to get in and out of there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While initially it looks like a boring game of getting the most shares in the first two or three big railroads, it turned out at game end that there's more to it. Don't underestimate the power of the private companies and don't withhold dividends too much to buy additional trains. The decisions are rather fine-grained, no game-changing moments. Instead it's a continous process of portfolio management and not getting stalled in track building. Not for the action-seeking 1830 lovers, more for calm builders.

RATING: 6
My introduction to the 18xx system.  I can see how this must be a much more gentle intro, especially regarding the stock market.  Still, the number of tiles and possible track configurations is honestly quite confusing for me, and working out how to make more money for yourself than for other players also is a struggle.  I like how this game system presents me with a challenge.  Update: I just don't think I will find the opponents or time to play a game like this.

Unit 1 is a tricky animal.  By itself, I don't think it is the best.  But it is the anchor for the 1825 system.  Once you bolt on Unit 2 and some of the regionals, you have a very entertaining map.

After my most recent game, I have decided to begin storing the entire lot together.  Piece together enough mapboard to allow some elbow room for the # of players, and keep the bank relatively small.

Our game ran about 5 hours with Units 1 & 2, with R1-3 attached and a bank of 7500 pounds sterling.

Between all three Unit boxes, I store most every expansion released for this game:  D1, K1, K2, K3, K5, K6, K7, R1, R2, R3, and the unreleased R4,

Very good.  This was the first 18xx I played, so perhaps it is partially out of nostalgia that I quite like this game.  Unit 1 is quite good for 4 players, and with that number it is not unreasonable to see each (or all but one)company get started.  It is  definitely weaker with 5, as really there are only 3 or 4 good companies to be played. Also, make sure that you print company charters out, as they are not included in the game!

The actual game is a deep brain burner of placing track, running trains and making money on the stock market.  Incredibly nontrivial, but a game without excess chrome (although the optional survey teams look really fiddly).  It's pretty cool -- the end of the game is really sudden.  The bank has been sitting there with thousands of dollars and suddenly all the companies start paying out dividends.  The bank clears out in 3 ORs or so after that happens.  This really shocked us in one game -- it looked like things were going to get really stagnant and they the game was over.

Despite the minimal production quality and ancient rule book the gameplay feels up to date. This is a solid share/company development game but with a runtime of 4-5 hours for 4 players it is not for evening sessions!

RATING: 3
I really ought to like this game as it has a lot of elements that I enjoy very much in other games, but having played it twice as a share-owning spectator either I'm missing something fundamental or the game is severely flawed. 

It seems to me that the first two company owners have a huge advantage; they get a head start on the rest, which may not come out for another one or two turns, they get the most valuable companies with most corporate funds, the most track tiles to choose from, first pick of the cheaper trains and the best board positions.

What makes this worse is that the ownership of these first two companies is largely determined by seating position, which in turn is decided by a random card deal.

To cap it all the potential for sidelining makes this game unbearable; 5 hours is a long time to spend watching other people play a game!  I don't think I will ever "play" an 18xx game again.

Much tighter with the tiles than 1850. You really have to make sure that the tile you need is available or you're stuck. Something to note, since stocks don't go down when you sell them, it is possible to push a company into operating by buying a stock and then selling it. Although this would take multiple turns, it might be useful if more than one person was doing it. It my first game (3-player), the first two companies wound up dominating the map since the third company couldn't come out quickly enough.

A kinder, gentler rail game than most of the other games in this series. The small board means 3-4 is really the best number of players to play with. Unlike other 18xx series games, you are wasting your time if you try to manipulate the stock market. Instead, this is all about timing and buying at selling the right stocks at the right time. An interesting diversion from some of the cutthroat games in this series.

A fine game. The company dumping and share trashing are not part of this as it is a refinement of 1829. Instead there are some interesting timing and tile and token placement decisions to be made.

Played this with 5. Compared to my previous plays of the other 1825s with fewer players, it felt quite flat. Not much trading was done, and the board was open enough that blocking play didn't really happen much. It's still a good game, of course; but it's not brilliant.

My first 18xx and I'm not sure it was the right choice. The length was reasonable (3.5 hours for 3 players) but the stock market didn't seem to offer many choices, with turn order largely determining where the shares went.

Had a 5 player game with Units 1, 2 and 3 plus R1, R2 and R3 plus K1, K2, K3, K5 and K7. Out of 14 major companies and 10 minor companies, we had 13 majors and 3 minors in play after 9.5 hours.

The upside:
-Extra focus on the operational part of the 18xx system, providing more opportunities for tile-laying/station screwage.

The downside:
-The map possibilities seem uninteresting, which could be mitigated with expansions.
-The share market dealings lack the dynamic/vitality that I most appreciate on the 1830 branch.

If I had to pick a favorite out of my current collection, this (and its expansions) would be it.  I find I prefer the branch of 18xx games that feature a non-predatory stock market, and this is no doubt the flagship.  The different ways to combine its three units and many expansions make this infinitely variable.  Plus, since it was designed by Tresham himself, it shows that trademark spark of his genius.

--Nov2012-- Quite delightful.  I'm not terribly good at this:  I'm better* at the financial manipulation side of 18xx than the track-laying and train management.  And this one highlights all those bits I'm not good at.
(*) Only relatively:  I'm a [i]very[/i] poor 18xx player at this point.

Supposed to be an excellent extensible train game, set in England for a change. Best with 3 or 4, quick playing. Tinny has it, oddly enough.

My review is after one learning game, but I really see the game opening up. So far so good.

I even expect the rating to rise a bit more

This game is very underrated, imo.

Would probably rank higher if I had the more dynamic stock market instead of the one that comes with set.

After one play, it seems like the set order for opening companies will lead to the game playing similarly each time.  I suppose the extensions/units will add variety.

I started my investigation of the 18xx games as something of a skeptic.  While I don't think they are the greatest train games ever, I do think they are darn good.  I will note that these really feel more like economic games and not so much like train games -- to me.  However, I certainly agree with the draw these games have.  Since my preference is more toward the route building / planning aspect of the games and not stock manipulation, I sought out the 1825 series.  Despite the high prices I am happy with my purchase.  I do find that I want to play any chance I get, which really is not all that often.  That being said, I haven't played enough to really have a preference for Unit 1 or Unit 2 as a multiplayer game.  It did seem to me that Unit 1 is better for four players than three.  [02/08/2007]

Wow, this is stupid tight.  The linear stocks are neat, but I prefer the crazy stock shenanigans of 1856.  Regardless there is action on the stock market and timing is everything as you may not be able to pull your company out quick enough when barreling toward the end of the game.  I feel this market was perfected in 1860, but it works just fine here.  I will say, that I'm glad the market isn't too crazy here because the track building is very stressful.  The scant limit on tiles makes for very tense timing issues; that unless you control two companies to double build with, you can really fall prey to the caprice of others.

There are other 18xx games that focus on track building, but this really pushes it to a whole new level.  Unlike other track based versions, the game feels that it is boiled down into its most concentrated form without any dilution.  It is a crazy brain burner. A real intense ride 'til the end.

One game including all regionals and D1. A nice 18xx, but the game felt somehow tame (We played this right after 1844 :D). Stock market is boring. This should work well with less experienced 18xx players.

I don't have much 18XX experience, but I did like this. It's neither too long nor too complicated, which makes it friendely foor noobs like me.

In the final turns, the game starts to stall, since there's not much room left to expand companies. I'd definitely play this again.

Played 2+ times.  Wow, what an experience.  Four newbies thrashing around in a game system, making lots of mistakes.  It was tonnes of fun, but I don't think we drove the train rush very well and the game took a long time.  Hopefully the next play is faster. **UPDATE** Used R1, R3, K7 and Lemmi's moderator.  Shaved a couple hours off the play time.  Ratting up.  It's a really great game.  The companies are a little bit scriptive because of the price bands but the minors added some spice and I can't see this playing that similarly any two different times.  There was also complaints from the peanut gallery that the stock market was pretty tame, but as others have said, this is more about building a good stock profile than about looting and dumping.  I think it's great. 2009/03/22

Expansions owned: R1, R2, R3, K1, K2, K3, K7 & G1

This game is very different from my previous experience with the 18xx series (1856, 18SCAN, 18NEB, etc.).  Reading the rules made the game sound scripted and, indeed, the first stock round is almost silly.  Yet, the game play offers a lot of depth and I enjoyed the experience very much. 

Ok, I have played this again and realize just how much I missed the first time around.  I think there is a lot more here to find.  Looking forward to playing this again.

Despite being "luck-less", this seems to play out differently every time.  It's quite long (compared to Euros, short for an 18xx) - 3-4 hours - but it feels like the time has sped by and I've loved every minute of it.  A very nice mix of route building / operating, with just enough financial shenanigans to give it another dimension.  Despite all of that, the concepts can be explained easily enough that I can play with my family.  For me, this is absolutely spot-on.

This is an introductory 18xx game. For the time it takes I prefer to play 1860.

An attempt to make an simple, fast, learning version of 18xx.

Unfortunately, the interest and fun were removed along with the extra complexity.

I quite liked this game; played with four players in around four hours. Two of the players were 18xx experts, and there were a few rule points that were a bit misjudged because this game was not quite like the ones they were used to. Frankly, it was just the right length and just the right complexity for me. I have no desire to play 18xx games that are longer and more complex, but I can understand how (for people who like those) this might not be optimally pleasing.

Oldest of the set. Not so good on its own, as companies always open in same order. Gets better when combined with Unit 2.

nice and simple 18xx game.  fun and quick.  the simplified stock exchange was neat, and encouraging of buying and selling stocks.  the board was small and tight, and there were good interaction and decisions.

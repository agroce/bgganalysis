I've played hundreds of games of Air Superiority/Air Strike/The Speed of Heat. I've got a huge three-ring binder with two copies of every Aircraft Data Card in it. It's about as comprehensive as Janes' All the World's Aircraft.

My rating reflects my feelings in the heyday of the game. Now, with Birds of Prey available (OK, in playtest), Air Superiority and Air Strike aren't on my "I'll play it!" list anymore.

RATING: 7
This was the culminating design of the AIRPOWER series by J.D. Webster and the Clash Of Arms graphical treatment is gorgeous.  The system is a bit dense and takes some getting used to, but provides for an engrossing experience.  Far better than FLIGHT LEADER, AIR WAR, FOXBAT AND PHANTOM, and other similar titles.  Only BIRDS OF PREY can rival this game, and it only deals with air-to-air combat.

RATING: 6
After pursuing realism past the point of sanity (Birds of Prey), I had to re-assess how much complexity and detail a game should have.  TSoH (and Air Power in general) is the limit one should attempt, and the fact that it doesn't cover the latest-and-greatest is actually quite okay as I find the current death ray missiles and super-maneuverable fighters not all that intriguing to play.

includes Air Superiority, Air Strike, Desert Falcons, and Check Your Six! Jet Age (Korean, Egypt/Israeli, and Pakistan/India books).

rating is a recent downgrade of all complicated air combat games.  I have had an epiphany that for all the mental overhead, they just aren't that fun to play and it is too difficult to find opponents.  Many of the games just end up being indecisive turn-fests, or won by a lucky shot/initiative die-roll.

My first air wargame, in an old box, and a toooo complex book of rules for my poor english. In spite of this, I didn't work on these rules since I discover "figthing wing" serie.

RATING: 4
Poor: Tactical - Modern - Very Challenging game play

Flying a F-4 Phantom itself must be easier than understang how to play this game.Maybe an excellent simulation but I can't overcome the bible od rules. Picked it up in a sale but unfortunately not for me. If there would be a simpler version to gradually start the game it would be better for me. There is one but even this basic game's lurning curve is so steep that it puts me off.

Sold it.

Good game but the mechanics can be tiresome. I have all the games in the series as well as Achtung spitfire and Over the Reich. I also was a playtester for the WWI variant which hasn't (and probably won't) seen the light of day.One of two tournaments I've ever played in(took first place)which got me a free copy of AS

The best jet combat board game I've ever played. Ok, so I have only played 1 other, also by J. D. Webster, but still. I found the balance between realism and playability in this game right on. I'd love to get back to this game system.

As the designer, not really comfortable rating my own stuff, but this was a post GDW game that pulled together all the rules updates and changes in the system that had been compiled since AS/STR had been released years before. In addition, tackled the pre-Air Sup. era of jet warfare, and was the first attempt by me to provide a lot of history in the box in the form of unified scenario briefs in time span order.  Poor cover art, poor rules editing, non-bookcase box format all hurt sales though.  Still - its the game the next generation is trying to improve on, so I'm proud of my effort.

An update of the Air Sup system, some good things, but too many special rules and the missions do not reproduce the difficulties of the US over VN.

Best game of Jet combat (tactical) there is. A fine blend of simulations and playability. The designers movement with flight points that can be either vertical or horitzontal is inspired and solved many of the issues with older airgames.

This is probably quite good flight simulation but if I compare it to Birds of Prey which are much more fun to play and I can also much easily envision maneuvers of my plane I have no desire to play Speed of Heat again.

A marvelous game, improving on the mechanics of Air Superiority/Air Strike and adding a new degree of historical depth and richness.  Nice components (aside from the mess CoA made of some of the formatting, and the silly box size).  Still holds up remarkably well almost 20 years after the basic system first appeared.

Air Superiority and Air Strike goes back to its roots. US Air power from the 50'ies to the middle 70'ies.

Much more challenging that either Air Sup or Air Strike, since weapons and platforms aren't as capable, and pilot skill is more important.

Fly the same missions as Jabara, Olds and Cunningham & Driscoll, or their soviet contemporaries. 

As an interesting aside, the scenarios detail a complete flying career as it might have been for a USAF pilot graduating somewhere after WW2 but before Korea, and flying until the end of Vietnam

Rules are a later edition than AS, but not updated to include the concepts from Whistling Death. As far as I can tell, it shouldn't be difficult to do so - making it a much more interesting game!

I came into the ruleset seeing that it was organized the same way as Star Fleet Battles. Unlike SFB, however, the rules are manageable. Takes a little bending of your mind to comprehend, but once you get it it's more understandable.

The final step in the evolution of the Air Superiority series.  While this is not the most complex jet combat game around, I feel it is certainly the most playable.  Yes, the rules are long and look complex, but once you get a few turns in things get easier and faster.  Lots of scenarios from Korea through the early Cold War to Vietnam.

Rules contain a few updates from Air Superiority.  the 12-second turn length makes this quite playable.  You can fly 2 planes in a dogfight without much trouble.  Ok with 2-3, Good with 4-6 players.  Nice components,  I play this a lot.  Small battles only take an hour.  Large ones with 4-6 players take 3-5 hours.  Excellent replay value.

The final Air Superiority game.  Good looking counters and a great setting for jet combat before long range missile fire became dominant.  Vietnam, Korea and the early Cold War...

I also really like the aircraft designs from this era:  F-86 Sabre, Mig-21 Fishbed, F-4 Phantom, F-100 Super Sabre, F-104 Starfighter, even the F-104 Thud.

Varied scenarios, probably the best game using the Air Superiority system.

Built on the success of Air Superiority and Air Strike, TSoH fixed a lot of problems and created a few new ones which soon had to be patched over. That said the package, with lots of aircraft and five-colour(!) counters was a really beautiful one and this is the apex of J.D.'s jet game series.

The Speed of Heat (Clash of Arms, 1992): I "inherited" this game, Air Superiority, Air Strike, and Desert Falcons, from my brother, the pilot - who appreciated these games much more than I did, but it does have a loyal following who like these complex wargames. I would prefer to trade all of them as one set.

It's too bad this series (which began with Air Superiority) has come to a close. This series is the best jet air-to-air combat game out there. The Speed of Heat was the last published version, and it still required a great deal of errata.  The errata have made my rulebook look like a mess. A set of living rules published online would have been nice or even a later edition of the rules.

I really enjoy this game, the rules are perfect to create modern jet era fightings, but they are as complicated as the mechanics that they need to simulate. It has always been a pleasure to play it, but quiet difficult (if not impossible today) to find some players for a game.

At heart another worker placement game but it is implemented very well and the multitude of buildings available seem to offer quite a few options for different strategies. I like the game quite a lot but 50 euros (the price at Essen 2010) was at least 15 euros more than it is worth

Rather dull.  I don't like this sort of game generally, but there is a fairly steep (and boring) learning curve to learn all of the cards.  It's just another Civ game in the Puerto Rico, Agricola, Seven Wonders, Through the Ages type mould.  I've played a lot of them and this one doesn't seem to have much fun as it's pretty repetitive and there's not a lot of interaction.

If I rated it out of purely subjective feelings I'd give it 3, but to be fair there's nothing wrong with the game objectively as a design, it is just...boring.

An underrated game, which in my opinion, was held back by the ill-timed release of 'Olympos'.

I would prefer this over Kingsburg if it only utilized a building sheet instead of the cards.

Yet another worker placement game.  Olympus' twist on that theme is allowing other players to select a lesser  version of the role you just picked, rather in the manner of the jobs in Puerto Rico.  Also like Puerto Rico, Olympus is a game in which you develop your production engine and build buildings that give benefits.  Olympus does give you a lot of buildings to choose between.  An element that could upset the efficiency gamers is player interaction; be prepared for kinks in the master plan from being plundered or plagued by other players.

While there are similarities to Puerto Rico, Olympus is a simpler game; you  place workers, gather resources, build stuff over and over for how long?  Two hours? In this way it reminds me of the same designers' Kingsburg, which also gets repetitive after a while.

Production and artwork, excluding the Hollywood Greek Gods are both of a good standard.

The gameplay is very good but sometimes it creates you a little boredom.I like a lot the situation,that it has to do with Ancient Greece.

The problem for me in this game is,that 2 unique buildings and 1 God are overpowered and the winner of the game is usually accomplished from owning at least 1 of these 2 cards. (sorry for my english)

A very good worker placement, with "beta" squares where you can follow in an action area after someone else has chosen it. Lots of buildings in your hand to familiarise yourself with. I won my first game by quite a margin.
...
Second game was three player, not quite as good because there is the same range of actions but fewer priests. Perhaps with three player one could try a variant without the Zeus space? Otherwise three player doesn't rate quite as high.

This is a perfect example why I don't like unpredictible number of rounds in the game (with some exceptions like Power Grid). I've played this once and after an hour we were done and the civilizations did not make it to the most interesting step. Some would say: "oh, you just played wrong", but the game let us to! Well designed game is not depndent on players playing good or bad. I'll not give Olympus another chance cause there are many other games and these days I require from a game to be fun from the first play. Not from the 3rd or 5th (which in this case could possibly happen - or not...)

The same authors of the highly renowned 'Kingsburg' designed another great game, and it is a very different beast: it's heavier than its predecessor (although probably not so heavier once players digest all the different buildings) and definitely better (but it will not have a widespread success like Kingsburg, because it's less immediate and nastier...).
There's nothing brand new in the game: it's worker placement with a couple of twists (possibility to "follow" other workers, and to attack other players), but everything flows well, the rules are simple and streamlined, it seems there's lots of different paths to victory, and the production is good (well, at least of you don't dislike Hollywood stars disguised as ancient gods...).
So, a very good game I look forward to play again soon.

First Play: Although I played disasterously I have to same this is an awesome game. With ample oportuunity for screwage and a need to be flexible its a face to face scrap over buildings and a race for the final flag. Multiple paths to victory, bring on the next game. I am very impressed.

Scond Play: Another runaway winner, this time through a very aggressive military strategy. This time with 4 new comers, the aggressor was allowed to build up hugely in Military and robbed most people blind. It would seem sensible to advise new players to keep up with military.

Still a very clever game.

Years pass and I get to play again. It seems that the plague space is a very negative aspect of the game. You must always have a spare priest to neutralise this loss of population or jump in first, lose a more positive action but get a point while everyone else loses a go. It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth with what is otherwise a very clever game. Perhaps its time to move it on. For trade.

I really enjoyed this game. Worker placement with a nice twist. Other players can put out their workers to do a lesser version of where you put your worker. The building were also fun. It gave the game almost a technology tree of abilities. I would have preferred maybe a played board to mark built buildings as opposed to cards, however. Scores in our 4 player game were 40-40-32-29. I won on the tie breaker. I think this will really shine with 5, which I will play with the next time through.

Only had the one chance to play this so far, after a single play through the game seems to have many rules and takes a play through to get to know the game, was very lengthy but fun (probably because of all the explanations) but would love to play it again at normal speed as it was really fun and competitive for such a low priced game. I would recommend this as a cheap fun game for 2-5 players.

2010, 3-5p, 60-120 min. civ bldg, wkr placement, var phase order, take that, no luck? per snoozefest (and extending on this, it can be cruel and unforgiving per other BGGers).  A great summary can be found in the comments of BGG user Thunkd (Note to self: the summary is saved in my private comments).  He astutely points out that players must keep up with each other in military strength because if a player falls too far behind in military, he will become the whipping boy and lose everything (lots of resources) to opponents who will repeatedly bash him.

Others say: somewhat steep learning curve, and favors experienced players (who will likely beat newbies); it will likely feel scripted and get same-y with time (everyone has same 30 card deck of buildings; once you find the combos and have experience, you'll likely get bored, frustrated or tired.  Not as good with 4-5p because certain buildings are better than others and there aren't enough of these "best buildings" to go around (although some have said there are other viable and less apparent strategies/combos such as all-out-war and a building that allows you to spend points as wild resources.

Possible best buildings? -- there are 3 buildings in the public area which are supposedly the best ones because they turn the 3 main resources into wilds (e.g., your venison can be used as the other 2 resources) and a 4th best building which makes everyone go down in a track when you go up in knowledge.

A worshipper placement game in which you decide what god to worship and then the other players decide to join you (for less benefit) or not join you - to save worshippers for their own turn. Nice range of godly abilities mean there's a bunch of ways to try to win. The key is what buildings to buy. each player has a deck (the same) plus there's some one-offs in the middle, available to all.

Olympus was not a game I had placed high on my wishlist for Spiel 2010, but at the same time the combination of worker placement with clear conflict tickled me enough to keep it in reserve. I was able to sneak in a trial game at some point. The game turned out to have a simple core mechanism: one player would put one of his (three) priests on one of ten gods from the Greek pantheon, and then invite other players to join in with the prayers. In doing so the initiating player would receive the 'alpha' action of a god, while the others would only receive the weaker 'beta' action. After everyone has indicated whether or not to join in, the actions are resolved. Players can get food or fish; they can increase their knowledge; increase the population; or perhaps increase the defensive capabilities. 

So why would you want to do this? Well, basically to construct buildings requiring basic resources to be erected so that you can develop much more quickly and gain victory points; and eventually to walk off of a development scale in order to bring the game to an end. Those buildings come from a personal deck of 33 cards (which everyone has) and a shared deck of 12 uniques; and allow for tons of combos, depending on mood and circumstance. The various timing mechanisms in the priest placement lead to a very clean whole which plays rather fluidly. I lost bigtime against a strong military strategy, and was a little annoyed by this, but who knows, perhaps with repeated plays that would solve itself.

At the time the game was sold out when I got a chance to play it, but even if it was still available I wouldn't have purchased it. The asking price of €52 was utterly ridiculous. It wasn't until a few years later, when publisher Heidelberger started liquidating stock, that the price dropped to a sufficiently acceptable level (which for a reject was still very high) for me to risk a purchase and start experimenting for real.

The first thing I did was print a play aid which listed all buildings in a short Excel-sheet. With this you can ignore the cards and quietly plan your way through the buildings without searching through the deck again and again. Playability improved markedly as a consequence, and you're advised to look for this very file in the game's file section. The second thing I did was neuter the attack strategy: everyone soon realised that allowing deltas to appear in military power was a Bad Idea. This in turn caused people to hunt for the important unique cards, which, as it transpired, were the [i]real[/i] heart of Olympus: these uniques do very nasty things to the opposition if used right, and you'll be wanting to set up your 'prodcution engine' so that you'll be the first to grab a crucial one. After that the game is all about mildly annoying each other and squeezing as much VP from your 'engine' as possible, interrupted by the occasional fight.

I like Olympus' smooth worker placement core, which does a lot with very little, and presents the players with a nice dilemma between following into the beta action, or holding out for an alpha. I have almost no worker placers in my collection; this is a rare exception. What I'm not so thrilled about is the limitation of the buildings in your possession. Once uniques run out there really isn't much you can do anymore; the startup too is quite similar for most players. It's not a game I regret purchasing, but neither is it a high-flyer. For every €10 you spent over €20 in obtaining this title, deduct one point from the current rate.

RATING: 8.4
What's satisfying about this game is that the rules are generally straight-forward, yet you feel like you have many choices each turn. The game is also tight enough that have to often race against other players to get what you want. The art is beautiful, and the playtime felt just right - easily falls into the 60-90 minute range.

The only thing keeping me from a higher rating is that I think this game gives a clear advantage to experienced players, as knowing what all your cards are and are capable of takes time to learn. This isn't like Dominion where you only have to focus on a handful of cards to feel out the right combinations - in Olympus you have a full deck of your unique cards to choose from.

Regardless, a very good game I will happily play anytime!

A sadly overlooked worker placement / role selection game.  It has a lot of similarities to Puerto Rico but I think it plays better than PR.  I think the problem is that having access to 30 cards at the start of the game feels overwhelming the first time you play.  It has a steep learning curve that probably turns a lot of people away, but getting over the curve is worth the time investment.

This one didn't quite work for me.   The PR-like action selection wasn't that interesting.   Each player has an identical deck of developments that offers a lot of options, but that was the only interesting part of the game.   It is very easy to eliminate a player in the early rounds via military.  Likewise, there is a runaway leader problem as the rich get richer in terms of card developments.   The game is too long as well.   The end conditions could easily be house-ruled for a shorter game, which might be worth exploring.   Still, there is nothing here that makes me want to revist it.  Put it in the "one and done" category.

Rating after two plays (three and four player) after which I am keen to play more.  In early games then anyone who has played before and has an understanding of the building deck and effective combinations will be at a substantial advantage.  Disappointing lack of sensible player aids in this respect.  You need a reasonably big table to handle this one, especially with more players.  Presentation makes it difficult to analyse another player's position and amongst those that are bothered i can see scope for analysis paralysis towards the end if people are trying to buy themselves extra time.  The Alpha/beta mechanic had echoes of Puerto Rico and I can see that this game is likewise best played with people of similar ability.   Experience suggests getting the right temples is important.

At the moment I played a few games and just one with 3 players (a couple of 2-players game to better understand the mechanics and cards) and I like it. Totally not randomic it needs a bit of experience to master the different approaches to victory. If you focus on battling a single opponent he'll be crashed (and won't like it) but this should be smoothed out in 4 or 5 players games since you must cover your own back. Some buildings are a bit too powerful but not totally unbalancing. Graphics is nice and components satisfactory.
In my opinion a game for both core gamers (with medium expectations) and occasional gamers (you can win with a few well-placed decisions).

It's unclear whether the buildings and such are truly balanced. In our game, I got one of the three powerful starting buildings from the middle of the table.  And because my opponents didn't instantly target me, I won by a landslide.
So rating may go up or down.  I'm worried that certain opening plays will REQUIRE your opponents to do some forced strategies to prevent run-away leaders.

I was mostly worried that the army option would be too strong, but I found out that it works well. But some of my friends hated it due to this and it's a big miss that there aren't provided reference sheets of the cards for every player, as this is a must to play it well. For the high price that shouldn't been a problem.

The worker placement mechanics with taking an option and all other have the chance to follow with a lesser favour is new to me and gave it an interesting twitch.

RATING: 7
This is a civ building type of game where you have some actions to choose from. When a player has chosen an action other players can follow if they wish and get a weaker version of that action. The actions are all different which makes you able to get resources and advance to get more resources later, build up your military and make war in order to gain resources, build different building which gives certain benefits and grow your people or scientific knowledge.

The game seems to be pretty interesting, but during the first game there were information overflow for me and some other players. Another knock against the game is that it went a little long for what it was. That said, I’m interested in playing some more as the key concepts are intriguing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.6
Great, but also greatly imbalanced towards the military strategy. I always wonder how games are published with only few playtestings. Otherwise they would have changed the pillage rule to max 1 good tribute per war not up to 5! There is no need to develop good production as you can steal them (double advantage: you have goods that others needed to waste their turns for it). If you get the building that prevents you from losing people to pestilence then we have a perfect runaway leader. It's a pity for this game as the mechanics work fine and the production value is good. But games with a superior strategy that you can't fight (only copy) aren't fun but a waste of time, as not all players can develop military equally (last player disadvantage: they lose one inhabitant by the pestilence and their goods by war; they need  two actions to compensate this. There is only one action left to develop themselves -> this ain't enough). This is a game where when I play first, I block the action you need and if you play first and profit from the alpha-bonus, I steal your goods or send the pestilence to you, which in the end leads to a near zero round for you. As I said, this could be fixed with a house rule, hovewer my rating must be for the game out of the box.

Played 3+ times 3,4 and 5 players. I like it best with 5. I am a little uncomfortable with games where I am to make an arbitrary decision about who I attack. I am scoring the game down a point for the odd ego twitching moments. Generally it all works well with balanced varied routes to victory. Having a large hand of cards to build from slows the first playing down, subsequent plays will be quicker. I appreciate the games unique feel. Nov 10

Decent but pretty average game. Only thing "new" is a worker placement mechanic that feels more like role selection. Otherwise it is a dry exercise in managing your little spreadsheet to get the resources that you need to play buildings from an overwhelming selection.

RATING: 6.5
Hard to comment... the game is interesting, but boring / dull at the same time. Some early cards seem to be too powerfull, not only by their effect, but they force the other players to adapt to it, too.

On the other hand I guess it can be a very interesting and tense game if all players know the game well. If I get the chance I will play it atleast once more which may change me rating either way.

At this point it's somehow interesting as I like games with tracks, even though this is more or less the whole game, with a WP mechanism included.

Olympus is an old-school eurogame that uses worker placement and resource production but also allows for attacking other players. It tends away from ganging up or negotiation, but rather is more about who is winning, weak, or has what you need. 

Each player has their own board which tracks production of resources, military might, and "knowledge". Knowledge is a requirement to play cards from your hand. This enormous (30+) hand of cards that you start the game with is probably the distinguishing characteristic of the game. Only certain cards will be practical to play at the start due to the knowledge requirements (and each player has the exact same cards), but these options will expand rapidly. You score points for each card you play as well as scoring points for the further along each track you are. Workers are generally used to allow for building cards from your hand, attacking other players, getting resources, or increasing your tracks. 

It seems very possible to pursue different strategies that favor different cards. Gaining many resources will require military to protect them, but it is possible to pursue points without focusing on resources very much. 

At least after one play, certain elements feel a bit forced (the plague space was universally hated by everyone at the table) and it's not a very original design, but it hits the right spot of complexity for my tastes. The cards are the strong point here, so it is a shame there isn't more variety in what is available. I worry about the longevity of the game for that reason.

A completely unoriginal, bland game.
If you want an euro and are ok with a rather thin theme, why not trying a Feld?  Each of his design has a least a little something new that makes it worthwhile.  This, on the other hand, is a rehash without any hint of originality; it's not a bad game, but there are dozens or better choices.

Not a horrible game, but it seems a little imbalanced -- if you fall behind in the military track, you'll never catch up; and if you can't protect yourself from the plauge, then you'll never catch up on the military track; and if you don't have enough priests, then you can't protect yourself from the plague.  Also, too much downtime for my taste -- too many building options leads to long turns and AP.  It's just not for me.

Imaging all your most hated game characteristics (arbitrary player attacks, resource stealing, runaway leader with no catch up, entering an early death spiral) all mixed together in the same game. Then imagine it going on for 2 hours...
This could have been great, a civilization building game with no randomness, but it simply doesn't work. Once one or two players get ahead, and that can happen quite early, it's all over. This is a half finished mess of a game that's truly awful to play.

RATING: 6
I guess this is an action drafting game of sorts, where the first player to take something gets a better version of the action and subsequent players may take an inferior version of it.  Lots of cards with text spice it up a little.  The game is competently designed, but it becomes monotonous after a while, because there are only ten actions and some of them are basically the same, and the cards that players bring out will encourage them to specialize.  I didn't find anything really compelling about the game, and besides, I came pretty close to winning in my first play, which is never a good sign... (1 play)

This is a surprisingly vicious eye gouging contest for a civilization building game.  The military component is utterly heartless allowing instigators of wars to steal resources from weaker players.  There is a balance mechanism allowing players to gather resources and then instantly spend them with the Zeus temple, but there are other activities which can be done without resources which in turn screws the military player who built up this engine.  Thinky in a minor way with a race for building cards & special temples.  Plague KILLS.

Oh boy.  This game is a real enigma for me.  The mechanics is fine and works nicely, but after 3 plays I'm not able to tell if the military strategy isn't, in fact, overpowered.  Especially in connection with specific cards (Temple of Ares being the most glaring example).
Also - some bulidings seem (much) more useful (and more often built) than the others.

The game is not for everyone - staggering number of different cards and high level of agression might be too much for many.  Fortunately playing time is managable (2-3h).

After 3 plays I see a replayability problem.

Olympus is built around a typical worker placement framework - most of the actions involve increasing one or more of various tracks, including "culture", "population", "military", or one of three different production tracks.

Military dominates this game due to the war mechanic in which the winner of a war steals resources equal to the difference in strength between him/herself and the loser.  This tends to make forward planning difficult for those low in military strength, as it is hard to know how many and which resources one will have by the time it is possible to build buildings.  It is possible to mitigate some of this effect via timing - i.e. doing production on the turn of your right-hand opponent, but this only works if your RHO cooperates.  I'm looking for a little more certainty from a resource-management action drafting game.

It will be interesting to see if Olympus acquires a following, as it cannot be accused of lacking player interaction.  Do the numerous voices who accuse Eurogames of lacking interaction actually have interest in playing Eurogames, or just in lobbing grenades at those who do?  We'll see.

Very strong game that punishes you for mistakes.  No real built in catch up mechanism so must keep play tight.  Appears to be a couple of routes to victory but whether you actively warmonger, you must be aware of it and either build up your army or time your spending so you have nothing.

Not really surprised that this one has failed to garner any real attention. It has a pronounced mean streak. The military aspect of the game is very reminiscent of Through the Ages (Arms Race / Bash the Loser).

In Olympus you use workers to activate gods...
Each god has an A action and a weaker B action. On your turn you choose which unselected god you will do the A action for, others can follow doing the B action or pass. Then the player to your left selects a god's A action etc... 

You are collecting resources to pay for cards. Each player has an identical deck of cards to build from. There are also communal cards to build these are limited and highly contested. Aside from the three 'money' resources there is military which you can use to attack (steal resources) from other players. Population, which you need in order to maintain high levels in the other tracks. Culture which you need to play cards. Cards have a culture pre-requisite which must be met in addition to the resources needed to play them.

Mechanically the game is very good. It was obviously play tested and streamlined and balanced well. The conflict is a sour spot for some, and honestly our group doesn't really like direct conflict too much. But it is calculated risk here, it's a bit like Through the Ages where keeping up with military is just what you have to do.

The deck of cards are great and varied and have loads of possibilities buried in them. I think this is a double edged sword as the reply is high, but so is the learning curve. It's overwhelming at first and unless you invest a few games early on it might remain bewildering. 

I have really enjoyed the games I've played so far. I think there is lots to learn and discover in the game which I really love.

I wish the theme were stronger and there was some narrative arc. I definitely feel good seeing cards pile up in front of me and all the cool stuff I get to do is amazing, but it never feels the least bit thematic.

Olympus reminded me of Through the Ages. As in TTA it's paramount to not fall behind in the arms race once it starts. In our case, that was from the very beginning. The one guy neglecting military ended far behind. Worse, he made the military strategy feasible for the other guy having the special building granting additional workers for successful wars and the development allowing him to take resources from the pool whenever the target doesn't have enough resources. From TTA, I learned my part and at least stayed competitive. The good thing about military in Olympus is that it's limited. Once you reach the upper border you're mostly safe and not susceptible to some freaking TTA Napoleon combo. 
To enjoy Olympus, you have to accept the pre-eminence of maintaining a military balance and look beyond where there's a fine worker placement game waiting. Workers are send to pray to the gods granting them favours. Knowledge and population have to be grown to gain capabilities to harvest more resources, to build more powerful buildings, to draft an even stronger military. If you don't get your engine of developments up and running, the snowball effect is strong enough to factually take you out of the game leaving you as weak prey in wars.
The distinguishing mechanic is the possibility to follow the lead player's alpha action with a weaker beta action. It's akin to Puerto Rico. This key decision on whether it's worth to follow at the cost of foresaking a stronger alpha action or more basic, want to be in the position to be able to follow at all, poses interesting challenges. Another strong point of Olympus is the wealth of available developments (about 40 including special buildings?). A few musts, probably a few typical paths, a few rarely selected developments but still enough variation to guarantee replay value.
Although Olympus features nearly everything that turns me off in Eurogames (targeted conflict, snowball effect, combo building), I still enjoyed it and might play it again. A '7' for the design although my personal enjoyment hinges on not suffering the fate of the one player falling prey to the others.

A middleweight worker placement affair.  I think it's a very good design, but is an unforgiving game.  The shtick is that after a player takes an action, everyone else has the option of doing a less-powerful version of that same action.  My main concern with the game is that despite their being a number of pathways forward, I wonder if some of the unique building cards are powerful enough that it's really a race for those in the early game.  Also, unusual for this type of game, there are actions that are directly take-that to other players, which a lot of gamers would not like.  Works best with five, maybe?

A solid game that doesn't really innovate much (there's a slight twist on the worker placement mechanism), but does what it does very well. The whole building system packed a lot of civilization building feel into a compact package, and the theme integration is surprisingly good. Right now I would very much want to play a few more games to explore the technology tree and the options.

If there's one worry, it's that if only some players build an early barracks, the other players can end up in a death spiral where they can't safely gather the resources to build a barracks -> can never be competitive in military -> will get repeatedly pillaged.

Beautifully produced worker placement game that uses its theme quite well. Possibilities for differing strategies and the game doesn't last too long. Special buildings might be a tad too powerful, but it's possible to play around that. The ending of the game is a bit of an anticlimax and can happen really quickly when the game just starts to end.

Worker placement and action drafting on meth. Prepare to dry-hump the other players over and over and over again until they beg you to leave their raw anuses alone for a round. I mean, it is really that cruel. 

So basically, it's Caylus, spiced with a whole lot of meanness.

Have fun trying to figure out which Hollywood stars are which goddesses. We had a bit of a tiff over whether Nicole Kidman or Renee Zellweger was more like one of them. But for sure, some of the art is taken directly from Orlando Bloom (Apollo) and Kristin Stewart's headshots.

The weird thing about this game is how carefully you have to plan when you'll end your turn. You generally want to go first, but have to manipulate the other players into putting you in a position to do so, and that can be difficult. There's a turn order thing that I feel like could be summed up in a succinct sentence but I'm not there yet.

Overall, I want to play this again, just to get the hang of it. I'm not sure it'll stand up to multiple plays; it could go up to a 9 or down to a 6. But for now, it's pretty damn good.

It's not really special but it works fine (isn't that special?), especially for a game that has no randomizer or luck factor added. Not a really short game but rather short for its civilization theme. A completely different game from the aurthors' Kingsburg but it still can be felt that they were the designers (e.g. the cards in hand have the same function as the buildings on the played board in Kingsburg). A fine game in a distinct Italian style.

A kingdom building game a la Kingsburg (same designers) where dices are replaced with pure worker placement.  Quite brutal with a fair bit of global "take that" and direct wars with significant impacts.

Fairly competitive and cutthroat.

It's just a plain bring worker placement that does not scale well with any amount of players and that does not have anything unique that makes it different from other games in the same category.

In summary, each player has a series of track representing various levels of their population. They will place workers on the main board to take actions that are going to play with these tracks and allow them a few other things. Then players may also use resources to place buildings into play that also raise tracks, lift restrictions, give special powers, etc.

Each player has a set of buildings which are all the same, and there is a couple of common buildings in the middle of the board shared by all players. All building has a cost that needs to be paid with 3 different resources.

Now these buildings become very hard to analyze because it's hard to calculate how is the best way to spend you resources. Second, you do not collect that many resources during the game, and you have resources spoilage, so it becomes complicated to know what are the possible buildings you could build by taking all the actions you can do and select which building from this subgroup are actually worth building.

Some building raise tracks by 1, so it just seems easier to simply take the action that will raise that same track. You also have many actions to get resources, but only 1 action + the wild one to make buildings. So you have a lot of stuff you can build, but little actions to build them and resources are not that easy to find.

Finally, you can simply ignore all these buildings and rush all the tracks to their maximum. It gives you bonus victory points for doing so and 4 maxed track will trigger the end of the game.

So our winner simply ignored the buildings and rushed all his track. The game ended sooner and he won the game. so the buildings are definitely worth less. So why bother about collecting resources to build them?

This is why it's seriously bad.

RATING: 6
I'm a bit conflicted about what to think about this game.  Can't decide if I like the vicious arms race potential and I haven't played enough to find out best strategies to deal with the military.

LIKES:

* Alpha and Beta actions provide you an opportunity to take the same action as someone else but without the bonus the alpha receives.  Nice twist here is that some of the buildings allow you take the beta action and receive the alpha bonus.
* Set of 30 buildings or so are the same for each player but provides quite a few different strategy options.  You will only play probably around 1/3 to 1/2 of the cards in the course of the game so one needs to try and set up combos and the like.
* The unique temples and other buildings on the board add a bit of competition and strategy choices to the game.

DISLIKES:

* From my lone experience and multiple readings of other peoples' experiences, military can feel really overpowered in the game.  Figuring out how to combat military well seems to be the crux to whether one enjoys this game.  A couple people in my one play were struggling to find enjoyment in the game when the warmongers kept stealing their stuff and making it very difficult for them to progress.  Once you are behind in the arms race, the journey back can be painful.
* The diverse set of cards that can be built also makes the first few games take quite a while as people read through them and try to ascertain the best strategies and combos.  I wouldn't recommend a learning game with five.  Game can take a long time.

08/21/11 Played a three-player game. I'm afraid there's not even a single new wrinkle to praise. That doesn't in itself make it a bad game, but that coupled with some other issues made for a disappointing experience. The game's main thrust, its a collect resources / move markers up on tracks / worker placement / construct buildings for VPs type game set in ancient Greece. All old hat features, but did they combine in some new novel way? Sadly no, not at all. I saw several people on BGG call Olympus "dull, boring, and over long". I agree. Plus many complained about having to paw through their own deck of 33 cards plus another 12 on the board each turn trying to find something to build each turn. That's time consuming and frustrating for the active player and boring for others. Its one of those games I'll play again, but I hope its at least a year between sessions.

Worker placement card game euro

First session with 5 took way too long. Probably thanks to a very AP prone player who needed to think every bloody time whether to follow or not, and what action to choose, or what card to play.

I guess I'll never play this game with 5 again. This game would be good if it took 90 minutes too play (as opposed to more than 3 hours for our session) Probably takes too long for what it is with normal players as well.

Fairly easy to get into worker placement game about gaining favours from the various Greek Gods and building up your land. You have six stats to keep track of; culture, population, military, and the production ratio for grain, meat and fish.

The worker placement is done through worshipping a deity. A player may start a worship session for an available deity to get a specific perk, and other players may choose join in that same turn to take a lesser version of that same perk.

The goal of the game is to earn the most victory points, mainly done through building (either common buildings from the player's own deck, or one of the unique buildings found on the game board) and being the first to max out any given stat. If you do, you earn a glory card, and once four glory cards are claimed the final round is triggered.

The game was not to hard to learn, the iconography is simple to follow and all buildings are thoroughly explained in the rulebook. It does lack a reference sheet, but it shouldn't be much trouble to make one. The cube colours are a bit too similar to three of the player colours (which confused my co-players when giving out points), so I recommend looking into alternative resource pieces, especially since the iconography doesn't refer to cubes at all.

All in all an enjoyable game

Das Spiel hat Potential und es stecken ein paar gute Ideen darin, leider scheitert es in der derzeitigen Version an der Umsetzung.In diesem Zustand macht es keinen Spaß! Zuviele Aggromechanismen, künstliche Zwänge, Timingprobleme und Tücken, daher leider in dieser Form, einmal und nie wieder!

A worker placement game, but much more about tempo management than anything else -- workers are resolved as they are played. (If you are militarily weak, but spend your resources before a war hits, nobody will benefit from attacking you.)

There's no luck, symmetrical starting player positions, and no randomness in the setup, so there's probably some cap on the replay value, but I suspect it will be entertaining to get there, and possibly there will be an expansion later.

Is this a deck building board game? It certainly plays that way........ The game appears to be far more complex than it really is, and the worker placement on alpha and beta places works very well. Also it is one of the few games that scales to 5 players effectively.
I would like to play it again.

A euro game in the style of Kingsburg but mechanically quite different. 

Olympus uses a variety of Gods as the worker placement aspect of the game and the powers they bestow are in keeping with the primary/secondary nature of RftG or San Juan. 

The 45 buildings on offer to the players with each play serve to bring the various mechanisms together as well as offer great variability in how a player goes about building their Greek City-State. 

There is some direct 'take-that' here in the form of being able to wage war and steal resources but it is handled with care and even losing a few wars does not mean you are out of the running for the win.

Overall Olympus is a good design worth exploring. Personally Kingsburg does it better for me and I think it is a little more unique as some of the elements of Olympus have been seen many times before. 

But as a game in its own right it is a good one. If you like Kingsburg at its core but dislike the dice rolling aspect then this could be the game for you.

A combination of worker placement and tableau-building which pretends to offer a variety of viable strategies.  In actual fact, players who try to focus on resource production and the more multiplayer-solitaire-ish elements will find themselves left completely in the dust halfway through the game by players who do not, with absolutely no hope of recovering.  The plague and warfare actions in this game can create massive gaps between players' scores, and it is with good reason that many of the comments here refer to runaway leader issues.

I see a lot of people saying that you need to play this a few times to learn what works and what doesn't.  My response to that is that a game with so many dead-end options, so many possibilities that fall into the category of "what doesn't work," is a severely flawed game that doesn't deserve those additional plays.

This is not a bad game, but feels too convoluted. It has elements of big kini(worker placement, where first worker gets two actions, next worker gets one), goa (development track), puerto rico(large set of buildings that help development). If this game came out ten years ago, I would probably have the patience to learn the effects and combinations of the different cards, but not any more.

Get resources, move along the resource tracks, get more resources, buy cards, move along the resource tracks more, get more resources, buy more cards, end game. Who did it best. The gameplay itself is worker placement. There's a bunch of spots you can "worship" which variously move you along the different resource tracks and generate resources, steal resources from others,  and get you along the learning track which allows you to build more powerful cards, and of course buy/build cards. The cards earn you the VPs you need, but also advance you down tracks or give you various powers to differentiate you from the other players. You can buy from the common pool, first in gets it, or from your own private set - each player's private set is the same. Anyway, the active player chooses a spot to "worship" at, then each other other player can choose to tag along and get a less powerful version of what the active player gets. Or choose to keep their workers for later, because then the next player gets to choose a new spot to "worship" at, and so on. By the end of the round, all workers are out, people have advanced down tracks, collected resources, built cards, etc. Then get all your dudes back and do it again. And again. And again. Exploring the cards is interesting. The "steal resources" track / power seems powerful and irritating if you don't keep up. You can choose to ignore it, but if you can't finesse your taking resources with quickly using them to build something, they can be stolen and you've effectively lost a turn. So I fear you have little choice but to keep up with the arms-mongers. Too tricky to manage otherwise, and it just takes 1 or 2 bad hits and you're set back a turn or two, and that's enough to lose. It feels better with fewer players where it's less an issue.

Olympus ist ein Workerplacementspiel. Es erfindet dieses Genre nicht neu, aber es ist ein sehr gutes Spiel. Jeder Spieler ist ständig in das Geschehen eingebunden, da nach der Entscheidung des aktiven Spielers, welchen Gott er anbetet, die anderen Spieler diesen Gott ebenfalls anbeten dürfen. Durch Ares und Apollon sind agressive Strategien möglich. Olympus verpasst die 10er-Wertung nur knapp. Einzig die Unübersichtlichkeit der persönlichen Gebäudekarten (für Anfänger unübersichtlich) und die Tatsache der o. g. fehlenden neuen Elemente verhindern die Höchstwertung.

After only one play. I wish the game had been better produced. I feel there is a good game here but the way the buildings are all represented by cards as opposed to the way they were done in Kingsburg makes it very hard to plan ahead unless you know the deck well. 

Also, it seems like some of the common buildings are overpowered, which can unbalance the game since they are not bid for.

Didn't care for it. Everybody has the same set of buildings from which you deploy about half of them to set up your combinations and resource acquisitions. 

Early games take a while to figure out the effects and decent combinations, later games once you find what you like you go with it and are not encouraged to find different options. The military track seems to be overpowered with the damage it inflicts and once behind is very hard to counteract. All this leads to a game that doesn't work decently for people with different experience levels.

Don't need to see it on the table again.

My favourite game from Essen 2010.  At first glance it is just another worker placement game, but with more and better decisions, routes to victory and variety than almost all other similar games.  I could make an argument that the military routes and the plague option for Apollo are a little underpowered (neither presents a great threat to an experienced player), but given that most new players feel that they are *overpowered* (they aren't, but they can seem like it when first experienced) perhaps I'm wrong.

A worker placement game; decent levels of interactivity, no random factors (except your opponents...). I really enjoy this one - my initial concerns on longevity have proved ill-founded, and this is one I keep going back to.

One thing to note is that the cards are very thin and you will want to sleeve them. In fact, the components overall are not up to the quality I'd expect for a 50 euro game.

This is a strategy game that becomes a tactical game that become a  strategy that becomes a tactical game.  Okay it's a worker placement that slaps you around a bit with some chaos. Flexibility is key when  formulating a strategy because when you are far from the start player you often lose out on the spots you want.  What is great though is there are building you can build to counteract and mitigate this.  Really interesting game that needs a few plays to see the tech tree of this game.

There's a few elements I really like about this game:

1. Turns run by fast. There's really no delay (with most players I've played with), and with familiarity this will get even better.
2. So many paths to follow, but it's a fairly easy progression to follow. You're initially restricted by your culture level, so although you have this fairly large deck of cards you can just put all but the one culture level cards aside and look at them later. Some cards are essential to build (barracks), so there's just the decision of how long you can hold off building them in order to get a jump in another area.
3. Simple rules and easy to teach. The upkeep order printed on the board would have been a very good idea though. (eg. Card effects in the upkeep phase come before tributes move to your supply - necessary to remember if you've built the Trade Routes.)
4. Balanced play. Don't be fooled by military level panic. It's just a level where you need to keep up with other players. (It's way more forgiving than in Civilization: Through the Ages.) As long as you don't fall behind too much then you'll be fine. You can afford to lose a couple of resources in this game if you've made up for it with production. Your opponents might benefit more taking a production action over pinching a resource off you. Troubles with military tend to be a first play lesson that you'll learn how to deal with real fast. Just don't ignore it and it works great.

A very fluid and engaging game that I was really surprised to like as much as I did. There are enough technology path options to keep it interesting for a few plays yet. Timing is all important. I've found it a little faster and more enjoyable with four players over five, but still enjoyable nevertheless.

Yet another worker placement game in which player compete to get resources and special actions in order to achieve points. Most of them are awarded by buildings represented by cards, which also give special actions and advantages. The game is tense, has a lot of options and feels fresh, even when it doesn't really show anything new. Nevertheless, with a few plays I believe that players may distinguish the good cards from the bad ones, and may follow the same path over and over again, as happened in [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=79&Itemid=1]Kingsburg[/url][/i] from the same authors. Although, only by playing multiple times we are going to be able to check if this is true.

The Zeus space is pretty much always the first place taken, but I don't mind that so much, since it creates interesting decision making for the other players. I don't particularly like the Apollo space. It makes it so that anyone with 3+ population needs to keep an extra priest available in order to avoid losing population. This just makes it so that everyone has effectively 1 less worker than they otherwise would. I like how the tracks work, and I enjoy building the various buildings.

Le se tagadhatná, hogy a Kingsburg alkotóinak munkája. A Kingsburg is gyönyörűen kivitelezett játék, ez pedig talán még annál is szebb. Gyönyörű kártyák, nagy jól látható tábla, áttekinthető saját táblák a játékosok számára. Jó ránézni a játékra. Profi.
Az alkotók egyszerűen lecserélték a Kingsburg kockáit kártyákra, amivel a szerencse szerepét nullára csökkentették. Minden játékos rendelkezésére áll egy saját pakli épületeket reprezentáló kártya, amelyeket a játékban szerzett nyersanyagokból leépíthetnek tetszésük szerinti sorrendben és időben. Nagyon sok kártya van, amiknek akár még a felét sem építik le a játszók a játék alatt. Ezen felül 12 egyedi kártya is van, amiből választhatnak a játékosok. Leépítés után a többiek már nem élhetnek ezzel. Minden játékosnak saját táblája van, amin a tudást, a harci erőt, a népének nagyságát, illetve a három nyersanyagbevételének fejlettségét tudja jelölni.
Ezek növeléséért küzdenek egy nagyon jól eltalált mechanizmussal.
A játék első harmadában azt éreztem a tökéletes játékkal játszom, de sajnos közben realizálódott, hogy lehet nem is rossz az, ha van kocka ebben a játékfajtában. Sajnos vannak teljesen egyértelmű épületek, amelyek fontosak, ezeket minden játékban le kell építeni, így lehet annyira nem lesz változatos ebben a tekintetben egy-egy parti. Az igazi változatosságot a harc hozhatja meg, ami egy különleges akciólehetőség. A harci erőtől függően a magasabb ponttal rendelkező annyi nyersanyagot rabol harcban a másiktól, amennyivel nagyobb a harci fejlettsége. Békésen talán nem túl magas lenne az újrajátszhatósága a játéknak, viszont harccal elképzelhető, hogy egy-egy játékos míg egymással van elfoglalva a surranópályán nyernek mások.

Tech Tree: The Game!

It works really well, but for my taste there isn't enough action.  You make your strategy and figure out what you are going to do each round and it either happens or you might need to defer it to a later round.  All the combos are neat, but the pace of the game is a bit glacial for how procedural that the system is.  

It can be really tough to build anything if you get caught behind the pillars against heavy military players.  In order to pull anything off you may have to wait 4 or 5 turns perhaps even making turns that do nothing good for yourself other than depriving other players of a way to screw you later.  For people that want little victories, these are far slower coming than you want.  As I have the patience of a toddler when it comes to losing my turn or waiting for something exciting to happen, this game just put me into pout mode and I became the equivalent of about 4 year old.

I swore that I was going to lose because I felt I more or less made no significant decisions for about 45 minutes, and it seemed I was spinning my wheels or just bumping tracks because I had nothing better to do.  It turns out that bumping tracks is what wins the game.  Perhaps I just expected more.  I'm always suspicious of games where I win dramatically and feel that other players were playing better.

Overall, I think it could be fun if you are staying active, but the game blows if you are losing your investments over and over again and you feel like you can't get anywhere.  The only reason why I give this a 6 is because the Temple of Ares is clearly crap so we play without it, but with it in the game I'd probably knock it down to a 4.

The first game or two of Olympus can be frustrating until you get a feel for how the cards interact with the board.  After that the game can be a lot of fun!  You each start with a deck of common cards and a few priests (workers) that can pray to the different gods.  Each god has two effects, an Alpha and Beta, where the Alpha is always more powerful.  Only the current player can get the Alpha, but the other players can get the Beta effect.

This is a game where having your whole strategy mapped out turn one doesn't work well - it's better to have an open mind, stay flexible, and always have 2-3 routes to victory.  That way if someone grabs your alpha effect you still have a plan!

One thing my game group liked about it is that the hardcore pvp guy in the group really couldn't do more than grief as long as you took a few basic precautions - pvp was a viable strategy, just not any stronger than the other strategies.

Just know that there are a few cards that are almost "have to have's" - like Tholos (which lets you get more workers faster).  And there are a few of the unique cards that are definitely nice to have, like the temples of Hera and Zeus (which let you get their Alpha effects even when you're on the Beta spot).

It's a worker placement game with action selection, civ-building, and a whole lotta stuff going on. Hard to know what to think since we played it wrong, but I think this could be quite a fun game. I just wonder how this would hold up to repeated play ... a little randomness is good, and this game has none!

--- Summary ---
Players each have a personal deck of buildings (varying build costs and prerequisite culture levels), and a player mat with:
- several tracks (culture, population, military strength, production capacity for 3 types of goods), with markers at specific starting positions. The tracks show barriers in different places -- require specific buildings to be built in order to advance past the barrier on any particular track.
- space for goods cubes (red, yellow, blue; start with 5?)
- space for tribute (cubes captured this turn, moved to Storage at the start of next turn
- space for meeples (start with 3; max 5 per game), used to select actions

The board shows several action spaces (gods), with a place for the first person to choose it and another for the rest (like Puerto Rico, first picker gets a bonus or better power than the rest). 

On your turn, you choose a god; unlike PR, others _may_ follow (by placing an available worker in the follower space for that god) or instead pass. The gods provide a variety of powers such as:
- producing a type of good
- increasing military strength
- attacking another player (simply compare strengths, taking cubes according to difference in strength)
- advancing along the culture or population track (at end of round, no track may be further along than the pop track)
- build 1 or 2 buildings
- earn VP
- cause plague in other players, who lose 1/3 (!) of their population (followers immune)

As you advance along the tracks, your abilities generally improve:
- culture: allows bigger buildings
- population: allows other tracks to advance, and gives you 4th and 5th meeple (eventually)
- military: makes it easier to attack others, defend yourself; CANNOT fall behind!
- production: produce more cubes with a single action
The first player to advance any track to the end gets a 2VP bonus. The game ends when the 4th such bonus is paid. Players earn VP for all their buildings, adding to VP earned during the game; most VP wins. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It's a card game in which players play their own deck of cards building stuff that help them to do better (hopefully)! It has some new things like the awkward cooperative play (Players can "follow" others actions) but it's not really cooperative (thankfully!!!) 

I like some of the things that the game has to offer but the engine at the start can be too slow and dull. I like the mid game to the end and that was a good achievement for the authors. A solid ending it's also a neat aspect that I must underline.

First plays are difficult to grasp mainly because of all the buildings players have. There are too many possibilities and it seems that you're always reading them to start you civilization. The game needs a couple of plays before reducing AP. It can be played under the 2 hours after some plays but maybe that's not possible at first.

This is something that happens with every complex game of course and it's not a bad thing. It's simply a characteristic.

Too much expensive IMO though!

Intriguing worker placements game that has got some serious 'take that'. Though in the one game played the military man came last. The game reminds me a little of Through the Ages in that military can be quite brutal, if you dont prepare for it. The military strategy can be countered though by not producing anything for the military man to steal or by using turn order to produce/build before he can get his hands on your stuff.

Also like TTA there is a balancing act between the different progress tracks, and the dreaded population limit.

With 45 buildings to choose from the options are a bit bewildering  in the first game, however left me wanting more

Three games in an i am still a fan. I think the game is better if there is useof the plague and war spots, its what makes this game interesting

4th game in and more and more subtlety and depth is being revealed.

Interactive, decent balance, slightly dry, but very intense workerplacement game with non-typical aggressive elements and many different ways to victory. Very popular in my gaming group. :)
Pretty cruel and unforgiving, so explain the game well and don't play with touchy players.

When I first played this game I really liked it.  I'd never seen worker placement combined with role taking.  After a few plays I have decided the warfare and plague spots just absolutely ruin this game for me.

Worker placement with a bit of a Puerto Rico feel to it, where choosing an action allows other players to choose a similar but lesser action. You'd like to perform actions in a certain order, but you need to adjust your plan as actions get chosen in a different order. The equivalent of PR's "shipping when you don't want it" is military & the plague, with the military being directed at chosen players (generally, the militarily weaker and goods-rich). Really enjoyed my first play.

A solid worker placement, resource management, building game, with a surprising amount of direct involvement with other players. Instead of just boosting yourself, you can start a plague, which hurts everybody who's not protected, or directly attack someone to steal their resources. With some upgrades mainly attacking becomes even a viable option for a strategy.

A lot of stuff that I like here, but very long and repetitive - especially compared to the dynamic 7 Wonders. Main problem though is the major pain infliction (military/plague) in the early game. What is it with designers and negative effects in building games?

Good mid-weight Euro worker placement game.  Nothing terribly new, but game rolls along well and feels a little like a worker placement version of 7 Worders.  Felt that there are a couple of pretty obviously strong strategies (and cards) to go for.

A tech-tree game with some nice ideas but rampant balance issues and a runaway leader problem. Another issue is that the tech tree isn't obvious ... there are many possible combos via your own personal deck of buildings and the public offerings, but you need to learn the text of about 40 cards to start figuring out what goes with what ... not something I'm going to do these days. The game also is frustrating for players who do not go the military route, as they have no way to protect their goods. And, while one player gets his engine going and everyone else flounders, each turn and the game in general goes on more than long enough to make playing out the string pretty painful.

Olympus starts as a lumbering behemoth, with oversized mechanisms you'll recognize from other titles.  After a long spoolup, it accelerates at a nearly exponential pace.  But the building decks blow out the learning curve; 45 complicated buildings need to be fully understood to enjoy the experience.  The player tableaus are large and messy.  If everything had been cut by 1/3rd, I might dig it, but as it stands, Olympus is too much and lasts too long.

RATING: 3
Not very impressed after one play. Unfortunately, the second play did nothing to change my mind. I find nothing new here and a pretty dry theme. 

Like Kingsburg, there are one or two clear, strong strategies that seem to dominate. But UNLIKE Kingsburg, there is no randomness or dice-rolling to help offset that. There is no variety or randomness to the available options, so it seems like you'd be done with it after a few plays anyway. 

It also appears to have a runaway leader problem and a disadvantage to the last player. Someone above compared it to a combination of Stone Age and Endeavor, two games that also disappointed me, so that may be a good guide to help you decide if this game is for you.

RATING: 7
A very unique luck-free worker placement strategy game with many layers of nasty interaction.

This game makes the rest of the worker placement games seem nearly non-interactive. Even with 3 players, the interaction is over the top. The action selection/following order is simple yet deep and plays a huge role on the outcome of the game, thus creating constant tough choices. Although this game plays very differently depending on the type of players (you can play peacefull after all), playing aggressively creates great tension and agony between choices. The lack of luck means that your fate is in your hands, but the plethora of choices and the decisions of your opponents guarrantee that no two games will be the same. This game creates a great sense of accomplishment but at the same time a great sense of insecurity that keeps you alarmed all the time. The common deck creates a variety of possible strategies, the progression of your city really makes a difference even from one level to the other, the buildings are powerful but balanced, and the unique uber-ones create an even greater interactive tension as building them greatly affects the game.

This is not for everyone however. Mistakes are usually not forgiven (unless allowed to by your opponents). If someone expects a casual civ game where you progressively become stronger and go for vps as efficiently as possible Olympus is not it. This is a game where you are struggling to preserve your city as much as you struggle to develop it, and you always need to balance efficiency with safety and with aggressiveness. You will gradually become stronger, but you'll spit blood until you do. The leader of this game cannot go runaway, but at the same time it's very hard to recover from mistakes. As a minor complaint, I note that the available actions are a bit less diverse than I'd like. The board artwork is also not that great.

Overall Olympus is an interactive beast. A simple base mechanism that creates such powerfull and agonising interaction with no luck is brilliant in my book. Not the kind of game that I'd love to play with everyone or everytime, it still is a great experience against competitive players. With a bit more diverse available actions, something to randomise the start of the game and better board artwork, this would have been a great game.

The game revolves around worshiping Greek deities, building buildings and war. You start with three priests and every round, in turn order, a player assigns a priest to worship one of the 10 deities. That player gets a reward depending on which god they chose and other players can choose to follow him with a priest, getting a lesser reward. This keeps happening until all the players have assigned their workers, or there are no unworshiped deities. Then there's some end of round stuff and you repeat.

God's do various things for you. They can bump you on culture (which lets you build better cards), population (which is limit on how high you can get on the other tracks), military (useful for fighting wars) and food production capability (meat, grain and fish). They can also let you use your food production (generating however many meat/grain/fish you've advanced to on those tracks), start wars, build buildings, get VP's or start plagues.

Each player has an identical deck of 33 building cards that they can construct and there are 9 public buildings that are up for contention. Buildings do rule-breaking types of things and are really the heart of the game. And they're also the biggest challenge this game has. Sitting down for a first play and trying to learn 45 cards is overwhelming. You've got to take in what cards cost in terms of culture and resources, what VP's they generate and what game-breaking effects they do. Figuring out which ones are important and what order to build them in is hard, especially when you don't really know how the game plays. I think the first game is really just going to be learning what the buildings are and figuring out which ones are important. It's going to take a learning game before players really know what they're doing.

One other challenge this game has is war. I generally don't like direct conflict games, and this game has enough to make me uncomfortable. Wars are fought by comparing military strength, and the winner gets the difference in strength in goods from the loser. Which means that if you fall behind, you're likely to be a target for everyone who has invested in military. One player in our game was stuck at 3 military (there's a building you have to build to raise your military strength beyond 3) and was losing 5 resources in each war to two jerks who kept pounding him. And that meant he didn't have enough resources to get his military higher, creating a vicious circle. That seemed like a miserable position to be in, and is the biggest flaw in the game for me. Maybe once you know the game, military is just something you can't ignore and everyone has to participate in that arms race?

What I liked about the game is the challenge of figuring out the buildings and trying to craft a construction plan to hit the right buildings at the right time. I feel like that would work a lot better in my next play though... I was just scrambling in this game. I thought I'd like the worker placement aspect of the game more, but I found that the choices of which gods to worship were largely straightforward and nowhere as challenging as figuring out the buildings.

I enjoyed the game and would like to try it again with players who all knew the game. I think if everyone knows the buildings and knows the importance of military, it would be a much better game. But it didn't seem like many other players enjoyed this one, so I don't know how likely it is to hit the table again.

In the Ancient Greece, the poleis (city-states) thrived increasing their population and culture, occasionally waging war against each other, erecting buildings and celebrating ceremonies to get the favour of the deities abiding on Mount Olympus. The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!

Very good worker placement game. Feels like an advanced version of Kingsburg (by the same designer) with different action characters and technology tracks but without dice rolling. A bit fiddly with all the different building cards you need to read/learn, but not too bad. Seemed a bit complicated at first but turned out to be quite easy to explain.

In Ancient Greece, a leader of a polis or “city-state” worshipped the mighty Olympian gods for the wisdom to lead. With the favor of the gods these leaders developed their poleis’ populations and cultures, waged wars, and erected magnificent buildings and temples. Now you have been chosen by the gods to lead one of these poleis; oversee your people’s path to greatness and your own path to dominion over all of Peloponnesus!

In Olympus, a worker placement game for 3-5 players, you send your cunning priests to worship the fickle Olympian deities. The gods will grant their divine favors to any priest who will perform a ceremony in their name. Use the gods for your own mortal purposes to increase your agricultural production, advance your culture, erect buildings, and go to war.
\13\\13\
Olympus includes a Mount Olympus game board, five Polis boards, over 180 cards, a rulebook, and over 100 playing pieces. A worker placement game that incorporates a unique level of direct interaction, Olympus has a strategy for any player from resource gathering and building development to more aggressive options, such as war and plague. Praise the gods, and reign over Ancient Greece!

During my only game i had the sensation of quite a good game with an important flaw: the excessive importance of Apollo's plague. Everyone was virtually forced to use it or protect against it during all the match and a forced move is not a good thing. i am waiting to be illuminated about this aspect of the game: maybe it was just a case.
About the rest of the game, it is quite interesting, lively, flows well but in 5 players it is a bit long (but time flows well). It seems the production tracks do not have much chance to be developed but again this could be due to our inexperience. I strongly hope to evaluate it better soon.

Een spel rond de mythologische goden van de griekse oudheid.

Spelers zijn mensen in het oude griekenland die de goden aanbidden. Iedere beurt mag iemand een god aanbidden en mogen de andere spelers beslissen of ze ook deze god willen aanbidden. Aanbidden levert gunsten op van de goden, maar alleen de eerste aanbidder krijgt de grootste gunst.

Aangezien ik wel een beetje een zwak heb voor worker placement is deze bij mij ook wel in de smaak gevallen, maar hij sprinkt er niet heel erg bovenuit.

Interesting worker placement game. You are "buying" favors from the gods each round. The each give different things. The start player gets the best deal but the other players can take the second option. You get more stuff by waiting to be start player but once a god has been chosen, you cannot go back to it later in the round. I enjoyed it.

The advancement tracks remind me a bit of Endeavor, but the decisions in this game are more interesting, and you are not forced to diversify as extensively as in Endeavor, making this a game with more real options.

The interaction here is also more pronounced than that in Endeavor.

5.5 after 1 play.

The main game mechanic of choosing the alpha and beta benefits of each deity is the highlight of the game.

The deck of 33 common buildings and 12 special buildings means players have to be very familiar with their costs and effects to play a proper game, i.e. there is a steep learning curve. However, given the deterministic setup and total lack of any random factors, it also implies that replayability may be low. It is therefore not worth the effort learning the 45 buildings for such a poor return.

The war deity, Hephaestus, makes the game even less enjoyable, as it forces everyone into an arms race once one player starts it.

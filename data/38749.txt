 Thanks again to the Dice Tower's Sam Healey for bringing this one up. The board is beautiful (MIchael Menzel strikes again!) and it is so simple to play. It gives you the Catan feel but removes some of the complexity that kept us away from anything Catan for so long. Down side is that like all standard Catan games it is not set for two-players without having to use some wonky marketplace variant.

After playing once, this appears to be a more accessible version of Catan as the resources and placements are already determined for you.  Also as there are three initial town placements from the start, resources come in quicker.  The bits and the game board look really great. I think this would be a great game to introduce people into the world of Euro-gaming.

RATING: 7
Obviously a Catan game, but with enough alterations to make it a new game.
The monuments can have a big impact, a short while into the game it seemed obvious that it was better to build more towns first so as to gain resources from them as the Monuments don't give the same long term benefit.

Players develop an economy in Germany.  90% of The Settlers of Catan are here, with meaty stuff like ports, hex tiles/random setup, and cities taken out.  In goes a fixed board, and German landmarks such as the Porta Nigra in Trier.  Plays just like Settlers, but turbo charged - resources are more common, and things are easier to build.  The robber, largest army and longest road is still there.  Landmarks award instant bonuses (roads, development cards, etc).  A good introductory version of Settlers of Catan.  Production is amazing - very beautiful to look at, almost to the point where it hinders game play (Does a road go there?  Is that a hex?  What resource is that hex?).

I know there are Catan haters out there, but this was our first entree into Catan and we love it. The miniatures are really great. Same basic game mechanics as Catan it seems, but a really nice twist with the addition of real landmarks. Better look and feel than traditional Catan. Worth every penny.

I would like to impose a house rule that no one can build in Wurzburg or Frankfurt (my old hometown and birthplace), to counter my husband's assertion that you can't go for 'his' spots :)

Edit: after a few more plays, I find my eyes quickly pass by THIS box on our shelf when looking for something to play.  It just doesn't give you the same feel as original Catan.  Maybe the board is too big and therefore makes it easy to just chip away at various landmarks without having to worry about space to expand.  I think the gimmick of me being from Germany has worn off and we can ditch this game.

I am rating this the same as I rated Settlers of Catan--some things are better, but some are worse.

First of all I love the landmark buildings and got the game for that reason (although they are not out of metal as I had hoped), and because I enjoy the Catan games. The insert has a nice feature the way it snaps the landmarks  into place.  

Most importantly, the game did not bog down, nor do I think it will, if utilizing the pre-arranged placements which give all the players access to all the resources from the beginning (unlike the Settlers of Catan). 

The board is attractive, but difficult to play--it felt cluttered and the hexes did not pop out, so that I realized later I had missed collecting quite a few resources.  Searching for the payouts slowed the game down a little.  

Even though the game is more aesthetically pleasing, it's harder to play the board; but since I believe the slightly different game mechanics are an improvement, it is harder to say I'd prefer to play one over the other.

Excellent game.  Looking forward to playing my third game of it.  Alot more fun than "Settlers of Catan" was.  Don't get too hung up on building monuments, though.  Unlike the towns and cities in Settlers, you only get the monument's bonus once (not once per turn after you build it).

This is Catan Simplified (fixed board, no cities) with the added twist of Monuments (Such as the Brandenburg gate) which can be built by any player connected by road.

This game is a simplified version of Settlers of Catan. The big board, cards and plastic bits are a sight to behold, the rules are quite streamlined and setup is minimal. The game plays almost exactly like Catan and is very enjoyable. A keeper!

After a few plays I really have to say this is a superb alternative to basic Catan. The board is so big and wonderfully illustrated and the landmarks give me the feeling of really building something in this game. It's also extremely easy to teach and play. A truly under appreciated gem!

Catan with Gemany map and some very gread models of Germany's places of interest. But the game itself is not better then the basic CATAN. In my opinion it lacks the cities and therefore the number of new resources you gather is not enough and the game therefore takes to long to hold its tension.

Think this may be my favorite version of catan.  Beautiful production, well sculpted pieces are all nice.  The game plays a little faster.  You get starting locations dealt out, that give a variety of possible number rolls and starting resources.  Also, instead of building cities, you build national landmarks, that give you a one time reward and count as a victory point.  In all, given the easy setup, quicker play, and gorgeous bits and art, this is my current favorite version to play.  This will probably never leave my hands.

RATING: 8
A very Settlers-like Settlers variant, but without the cities.  One could argue that it is more balanced, since you can't just park cities on the good hexes and continue to collect on them forever.  Roads are more important, because you need to actually build all over the place if you want to get more points.  Landmarks are kind of neat, because they are so cheap to build and get you something guaranteed, but it's still better to build more settlements and get more goods over the course of the entire game, since there are plenty of good places to build them.  They don't look as impressive though.   On the whole I prefer Settlers, but this is the first time I've played a Settlers variant and thought that a reasonable person could choose it over Settlers for any number of plays. (1 play)

RATING: 6
First played April 1st, 2009. Taught in 5 min (to players that known Catan) and played in about 90 minutes for 4 players. It could have easily taken 60 minutes if things fell just right for the leader at the 1hr mark of our game. Each player is given two starting goods and three starting cities. Much is the same as Catan. There is a "robber" you build roads, cities, landmarks and dev cards with your resources of wood, brick, sheep, wheat, and ore. Everything is worth 1 VP: Longest road (at least 5), most mercenaries (at least 3), city, landmark, and VPs from dev cards. When you build a landmark you get a one time good of two cards, a road, or a dev card or two. On your turn you roll (7 gets the robber and you steal a card) and everyone gets resources their cities touch (unless the robber is there). Then you may trade and build. First to 10 VPs wins. This was too much like the base game for me. It was fun to play however I guess I'm tired of Catan now.

A nice diversion from ordinary Catan that's even a bit lighter than plain Catan. The fixed map limits replayability. Trading seems less prominent as players always can change 3:1 and don't need a port for it. The game is also a bit shorter as players already start with three points and the landmarks are cheaper to build than cities. It's a bit lower on strategy as the lack of upgrading and the prerogative to build a town / landmark before roads can be continued beyond them reduces alternatives. Except for Settlers afficionados and game collectors there's no reason to own this in addition to Catan. Still a good game though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game, and probably my least favorite of the Catan games I've played.  I think the unequal number of hexes for various numbers (i.e., 6/8 have different numbers) and the forced value of certain areas can channel play in the game.  It wasn't bad, I'd play it again, and it wouldn't be a first choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I appreciate the idea behind the game.  The fixed board setup doesn't bother me, as the starting spots seemed pretty fair.  Of course the dice don't always play fair, but that's part of playing Settlers.  The board makes it a little more difficult to tell what resources you get, but I suppose that as we become more familiar with it, that annoyance will wear off.

The game feels slower, mainly because you cannot get cities, and because the monuments impede your growth a bit, though they are necessary to build.

I like the pieces, and if I was more familiar with or interested in Germany I would probably like it more.  I'm not sure that I would play this over vanilla Settlers (mainly because it's longer), especially with 4 players.  But I'm definitely down for a French or US map!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not bad.  I'm not positive that the starting players are balanced, but that's just going by feel.  There also seem to be an advantage to getting good rolls in the beginning since the default placements seems to really cluster folks around certain resources and numbers.  Woe be the person who has all their lumber and brick on fives and they never get rolled.

This game is far more forgiving than normal settlers.  Being able to trade 3:1 with the bank or 2:1 with certain development cards allows you to compete when others won't trade.  Also with the way things work it is much easier to see if anyone is close to winning the game.  This is now my choice when playing Settlers.

Played twice, 4 players.  Better than original Catan in one obvious way - quicker.  Everything is pre-set in this game; the numbers, the location of cities, and the starting locations.

Very beautifully produced game plays much like basic Catan with a few exceptions.  Only towns are built, no cities.  Monuments and special buildings can also be built for a point.  You cannot go through a town or monument site with your roads until you have built it.  It can be difficult to find the cities and even the numbers on the hexes can be difficult at times as well.

It's been a hit at German Games Night, I've taught a few people to play. This version is pretty easy to learn.

The strength of this game isn't its built-in replayability, (regular Catan would be better from a pure variability standpoint), but rather a few other factors:

It's more accessible than regular Catan with fewer decisions to make regarding where to place starting settlements or having to figure out where resources will come from (you'll generally have to get ore from the Erzgebirge, sheep and grain from the north, etc.)

There's a little less conflict in the regular game in that one of the goals is to build the country's landmarks and they can't be used to cut off anyone's trade route, as they're public buildings.

Finally, the game is connected to German history and has interesting components. If you want to learn about German history, the game comes with an almanac and you'll have the landmarks built on a map in front of you, with maybe some historical figures in your hand giving you those victory points you need.

If someone will be playing this game a lot, there is the option to draft starting locations rather than using the suggested setup on the player aid cards and rely on the countless dice rolls to expect different experiences. 

There's the whole meta-game aspect of Catan, regardless: who will trade with you and why?

In short, the game is not built like the original Catan; if a variable setup is of prime importance, Catan Geographies Germany is not the version to get. This game will provide variability through starting city selection, dice rolling and the players themselves. If the game looks good to you, I encourage you to get it, I have to say that is a favourite of mine.

RATING: 7
Any Settlers with a fixed map needs a pretty good twist to make it interesting enough to garner replay, enough to override the lack of intergame map variation. Unfortunately the addition of monuments (which provide 1 mini instant reward and 1 VP but no long term benefits) doesn't quite cut it. The strategy is simply to build as many villages as possible to maximise your resource engine, and build monuments later to get you over the line. The board seems pretty balanced as you'd expect. With no cities in the game, there seem to be fewer wild spikes in resource generation, so it's hard to get an edge, and the results seem bound to be close at game end. Settlers is always fun so this is worth trying out for variety, but it doesn't offer enough of interest to warrant long term veering from the more interesting variants already out there.

Settlers is one of my favorite games all times. Have had this sitting on the shelf for a few years now and finally got to play it. It's of course a lot like the original game, but still adds some variation. I thought it difficult to find all the numbers when rolling for resources since there are so many areas, but that's a minor problem. With a set map I assume this could get the same every time, especially if you start with the balanced setup.

RATING: 6.5
Based on one play: A very nice board, yet it is very similar to Catan. The changes do not have a great effect, almost like a variant, but still fun. May also be better for new players, since the board is set and there are only settlements, no cities. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an interesting version of classic Settlers.  Most of the rules are the same, so a player familiar with the regular game can jump right in.  The board is pretty busy, which makes distributing production a little tricky.  I enjoyed building the landmarks though, and being able to find out more about each city and landmark (in the included booklet) added some pseudo-educational value to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Catan derivatives never seem to live up to the original game, and this one is no exception.  This game replaced cities with monuments, which give you a point and a one-time bonus of some resources.  Additionally, the game had a fixed setup, complete with fixed starting positions for the players, and limited where new settlements could be built.  Overall, I felt like this was constraining, and prevented players from specializing in a particular strategy.  That said, it's still Settlers, so if you enjoy Settlers and are looking for a somewhat different experience, then you'll probably enjoy this.

What can be said about the game itself that has not already been said. The Germany edition as the hard board that is not modular like the other edition. This remove some of the randomness of the initial tile placement of the previous edition. You dont get to choose your initial starting positions as it is already determined by the rules. There is no upgrade from a village to a city in that version. You get instead to build landmarks for extra VP and bonus. The material is super but the board, although very nice, is a little hard to read.

Qu'est ce qui peut être dit de ce jeu qui n,aurait pas encore été dit. La version allemande possède un plateauune pièce qui n'est pas modulaire comme pour les autres versions. Vous ne choisissez pas vos positions de départ car celles-ci sont déterminées par les règles. Il n'y a pas d'amélioration de village à ville dans cette version. Vous devez en revanche bâtir des monuments pour des points de victoire et bonus. Le matériel est superbe mais le plateau est un peu dur à lire.

Not sure this is worth the price.  It is good for a few games, but I bet it will lose enjoyment quickly.  Too static in start.  Bought half-price at GenCon 2009.

Nice diversion from Settlers without the need to learn any mind blowingly new rules. The map is tight - but pretty good for learners of the system, since it clearly indicates sites for towns. Looks cool as well once the monuments get built.

Having said that, there's no way I could justify buying a set as I can't see this as anything more than an expensive distraction. It is perhaps a little too similar to settlers to offer anything new, but if you've got a friend who owns a set (like I do) I'd be up for a few games a year.

I do not rate games on BGG that often, but I think this game is heavily underrated. My rating is based on the review I wrote, not because I want to lift the average rating on BGG. Read the full review at http://www.gamepack.nl/gamepack/rec-catandl-E.html

Beautiful game, so much nicer looking than regular Catan.  The board is huge though, figuring out resources after dice rolls is fiddly.

This is one of our favorite Catan incarnations. The use of Germany is done really well and the landmarks are super cool (and really nicely made) and the bonuses they bring are very useful. (JW)

The only one of the Catan games that I continue to enjoy after every play.  Building the monuments, and the rewards you recieve for doing so, is a great shake-up for the Catan system.  It sounds kind of touristy, but the mini almanac on Germany that come with the game, explaining why they designed some aspects of the game the way tehy did was also a very cool thing.

One of my preferred Settlers versions. The theme is an improvement over the abstract island layout and I don't tire of the static nicely balanced board layout. The building of prominent landmarks and the lovely pieces to represent them injects a rather dry game with new life and interest. Plays very well with my six year old.

Super fast setup removes Catan's greatest weakness and the board is incredibly well balanced.  Unfortunately, replay value isn't as there as I'd like.

It is exactly what you think this is.  Settlers set in Germany.  It is good.  The twists are fun, and the game is a bit more accelerated (which I think is good).  But, it just isn't THAT much different for me.

The pieces are awesome.

Lots of similarities with the original Siedler and small differences. The game looks absolutely beautifull. Only buy if you really like the original Siedler, if you want a more complex game, choose something else!

A beautiful edition with some nice variants to the basic rules, one of my favorite editions. MAJOR difference: the numbers that are pre-printed on the hexes are distributed in such a way that production is more even than the odds would normally dictate.

Catan with a different flavor.  New folks won't be victimized by bad initial choices, as start places are predetermined.

RATING: 5
Played with three and the board is too congested for the 12 victory points needed to win.  I lucked out and drew three of the four victory point cards.  It seems like it would be even more restricted with four.  Also, I did not build a single monument.  You have to spend three cards to often win two.  Huh?  The board is beautifully produced, one of the ebst I've ever seen, but there are many superior versions of Catan, including the classic original.

RATING: 7
Beautiful components. Its vital to have your town situated next to 6s and 8s. Even if you are unable to get the resource that you want, the 6s and 8s can provide enough cards for you to exchange 3:1 with the bank.

RATING: 8
Another good variant in the Settlers family. This is much closer to the original than, say, Settlers of the Stone Age or Siedler von Nürnberg. Important tweaks are the monuments, which are a nice feature, and the lack of trading ports, which are sorely missed. Also, the board takes some getting used to. It looks great, but is much less functional than the clean design of the original. On balance, I'd rather play vanilla Settlers, but this is definitely worth playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
On first playing this seems a fine, slightly altered approach to Settlers.  It's a fixed map with fixed starting positions and fixed locations on the board for building buildings worth victory points.  You build roads to one kind of location or the other and then buy a wood/brick/wheat/sheep building that produces resources on the dice roll or a stone/stone/wheat monument that doesn't.  We enjoyed it.

Les plus : 
 - le matériel est très beau
 - le placement initial n'avantage pas les joueurs d'expérience

Les moins:
 - le placement initial est aléatoire
 - le plateau est beaucoup plus difficile à lire pour déterminer la production
 - les cités ont disparus et il devient difficile de s'en sortir si nous n'avons pas de bons développements
 - les ports ont disparu... un autre point qui rend la tâche plus difficile pour ceux qui n'ont pas de bons développements

Personnellement, je préfère l'original.

I like this game a little better than vanilla SoC since it is quicker to set up. This might limit the replayability of the game, but I probably won't play it often enough to matter. Very nice components, although I prefer the wooden roads and settlements to the plastic roads and town halls as they feel more solid. The landmarks are a nice touch, adding another strategic option to the game.

By far my favourite Catan game. I have given away several of my other Catan games and can't see myself wanting any other besides this one. I like that is has a board (and not tiles), that it has plastic pieces (for the shapes and colours), the landmarks (because they add a nice touch) and the rules (being simple and straightforward).

Totally different game in my opinion from the normal Catan game. It's a good game in it's own right but they should have just dropped the Cantan name for that one.
The game board is non-variable in this one and depicts a map of Germany with some of its major cities. The game is easy to get into but not as simple as Catan itself.

RATING: 5.5
A pretty variant of Settlers that I think is inferior to the original.  The monuments look nice, but the mechanic doesn't really add anything to the game.  Because there are no cities (versus towns) and no ports, the game doesn't ever speed up (since people aren't getting more resources/using them more efficiently).

I'd stay away from this one.  If you want to try a decent variation of settlers, pick the USA Rails variant - it is much better.

This a great way to lay out Catan.  It is much more fair than the normal game, although the normal game is really fun too.  I would recommend Germany catan for beginners for sure, it's somewhat easier to understand/play

RATING: 4
A stripped down version of Settlers with a fixed map, the use of separate monument builds instead of town/settlement upgrades, no ports, and reduced point values for largest army and longest road.

For people new to the hobby, this is likely the best "Catan" choice.  I'm not a big fan of the series, however, and this version is even less interesting than the original.

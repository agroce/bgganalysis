Simple Bietrunden (18) eine nach der Anderen. Ist ganz nett, aber letztendlich ist es ein sich dauernd wiederholendes verdecktes Auswählen einer Steinkombination, Hand hinhalten, Karte nehmen.

Igazán kellemes "kis" kártyajáték, amely a Pápa választás ceremóniáját feszegeti.
A jelző a doboz méretére, és nem a játék élményre utal. (Egyébként a "vaklicites" játékok kategóriájába sorolható.)
Kitűnő be/levezető játék, de semmi esetre sem egy komoly darab. Nagy előnye, hogy a doboz méretéből adódóan akár egy kirándulásra is elvihető, hiszen 3-4 embernek cca. 45 perces kellemes szórakoztatást biztosít.
A lapok ábrái igényesek, kitűnő minőségűek, és a játék ismeretszerzésre is kiváló.
Ajánlott kategória, szívesen játszom vele bármikor.

Interesting auction game with a ever green theme. Game seems to be balanced and probably things remain even during most of the games. Production quality of the game is also above average which makes the game a solid purchase.

RATING: 7.5
Nicely themed auction game; reminiscent somewhat of 'Edel, Stein & Reich', though rather more complex - it manages to fit a fair amount into a short(ish) game, including a fine grained scoring system and a variety of action cards which, for me, fell on the right side of the 'take that' line.

RATING: 7
Great combination of hidden bidding game and set collection with unconventional theme. Easy and clean mechanisms, like the gems value system during bidding (quantity over value, values break the tie). Good components, art on cards is... well some people like it some don't, but it fits the theme. Only 3-4 players and lot is going on - that is a minus for beginners.

18 rounds or so of blind bidding with a take-that grand finale. I dislike blind bidding, and this game did not make me want to play it again. Once you know the cards and understand the size of the economy you can value your bids better, and supposedly the game is well balanced. However, I did not get drawn into it enough to give it more time, not while games like Modern Art and Ra, or even the underrated Basari, exist. 

Also, I fail to understand why players use gems instead of money cards to bid.. An ok game only playable with 4 to keep the tension high.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A short bidding game with a set of repeated blind bids on three types of open cards with the ulterior goal of collecting the most votes to be selected pope (or to point at the new pope). In terms of Doing The Subject Right this game blasts the horrible wreck Borgia (which features a similar subject) clean out of the Solar System. However, I find games where I am supposed to bid with limited resources on lots of cards with numerous varying ‘combos’ hidden in them boring and uninteresting. The blind bids should have made the game more palatable for me, but the blind bid does not work nearly as well as it does in other such titles. Once you run out of gems it is hard getting new ones; at the same time you cannot afford to lag behind as you will be taken advantage of left and right by preying players. Repetitive, confusing inconography, overburdened. I finished my game, and will not play another. It's simply too involved for what it essentially is.

1655 Habemus Papam is een kaartspel met een blind biedsysteem.

Regels: De spelregels zijn verschrikkelijk. In dit spel zijn er vele regeltjes en het spelregelboekje is totaal niet overzichtelijk. Als je het spel niet meteen speelt nadat je de spelregels hebt doorgenomen, zal je de spelregels zeker nog eens opnieuw moeten lezen om alle verschillende kaarten te kunnen onthouden. Voor een vrij eenvoudig biedspel als 1655 Habemus Papam hadden de spelregels zeker overzichtelijker geschreven mogen zijn. Gelukkig kwam 999 Games met een online spelregeluitleg waarin alles simpel en duidelijk werd uitgelegd in minder dan tien minuten. Een verademing! Als je het spel eenmaal hebt gespeeld, dan valt alles op zijn plaats. Het spel is zeker niet moeilijk, integendeel!

2015-11-26 : This is a blind bidding / set collection game - so far nothing special but the the objective of acquiring enough votes to become the next pope is very present in a good number of historical chrome rules that lift it above a mere bidding game. Cardinal factions, royal interventions, buying votes, cardinals dying - it's all in there. A little jewel of a game that hits the table on a regular basis.

I like how the theme is interwoven with the mechanics. It's certainly a bit abstract game but the amount of effort put in it in order to make the title as accurate as possible is admirable.

Reminds me of "Edel, Stein & Reich".

While this is a small and simple bidding game, it´s pretty complex for what it is. If you like bidding games that take 30-45 mins only, you should give it a try for sure.

*update*
Having it played more often, the game should only be palyed as a 4 player game.

Surprisingly deep and balanced auction game with an interesting theme and smooth flow. The game even comes with a nice historical background leaflet. Everyone's trying to gain as many votes as possible, but through order cards players' game plans are differing and each auction builds the game tactically to new directions. What you want from each auction and how many gems will get it for you are interesting questions each round. Definite plus points also for the camerlengo function. There is a good amount of tension, but it is building up towards the end in a very negative way. The last few rounds tend to be flooded by lots of action cards and take that.

I hated this game when I played it, but I think I was too harsh on it. It's not a bad game, but the rules are very poorly written and make it sound about a thousand times more complicated than it really is. The theme also doesn't help, as electing a Pope is not only not something I'd get excited about, but something I'd like to prevent. Still, there's nothing wrong here, but there's also not much to recommend.

Gioco di carte semplice e strategico. La partita rievoca il conclave del 1655 quando i cardinali si riunirono per eleggere il nuovo Papa. I giocatori dovranno cercare di aggiudicarsi i favori dei cardinali e gli aiuti esterni delle personalità più potenti dell'epoca per eleggere la persona di fiducia. Il gioco si basa su combo e aste, trattandosi di un gioco di carte anche la componente fortuna ha un ruolo importante ma, grazie all'ottimo tentativo di ambientazione, il gioco risulta divertente e molto godibile.

Gosh. A barking-mad, points-for-all bidding game in the manner of Patronize only with more meat on the bones. Good luck panning out any sort of strategy - it's all about being cut-throat and manipulative here. The oddball theme is the real winner: it is surprisingly compliant to the mechanics and you can almost believe that this is how Popes are really elected - there are lots of smart little thematic and historical touches to the gameplay.

This is a really simple auction game with blind bidding. You try to collect the most valuable cardinals, in order to be chosen as pope.

Fun little (blind) bidding card game, with some take-that interaction. Every round there are 4 cards to bid on: a cardinal card that'll give you a point or two, a political card that's an alternative way of gaining points, an action card that allows for some interaction between players, and a card that'll restock your bidding gems. Highest bidder has first choice.

Card are close in power, so knowing when to bid a little or a lot makes all the difference. There's also a small number of cards that allow you to steal, discard or exchange your opponents' cardinal cards. Quite fun, but this unfortunately means that the player who is targeted the most has little chance of winning. Of course, if this happens it's mostly your own fault, but it's this extra bit of chaos that stops 1655 - Habemus Papam from being a 'serious', or strategy game. It is, however, quite a pleasant way to spend the time.

RATING: 4
The looks and components of this game are very nice and DDD can certainly put together an attractive game in a appropriate sized box. The English rules are a bit muddled from time to time, but perfectly understandable.

Now for the game itself: If you're going to invest your time playing a game whose sole mechanic is 18 or so blind bidding auctions then I'd choose the vastly superior O Zoo le Mio over this. Where O Zoo le Mio has the neat zoo building element and continual majority fights over the course of the game, 1655 - Habemus Papam has dull and confusing card iconography setting you up for one big scoring at the end. 1655 - Habemus Papam uses a blind Basari type bidding system, but the income supply is far more limited than in Basari because a maximum of three gems are reintroduced each round. This makes auctions an even more dull affair often determined by turn order.

My final gripe is with the action cards that allow you to steal cardinals, money and any decent chance that your careful planning will mean much. The final few rounds degenerate into a flurry of theft and chaos as these cards are played.

Obviously this game was a labour of love for the author - great care has been taken to inject historical flavour and accuracy with the characters, but the game is not the best in it's class in what is a very difficult mechanism to pull off with any success. Repetitive blind bidding games need an extra hook to take your mind off the mundane calculating and planning. 1655 - Habemus Papam is possibly a better game with three players - where the third player gets two choices and bidding will possibly be on average lower and gem types more meaningful. However, I have not felt the desire to use my precious gaming time to test that theory.

I find the game a bit boring as the decision on the cards to be taken didn't seem to have enough tension. It became a so so strategy game as the cards all seem to be equivalent or "good enough" not to risk on a major bidding. Maybe playing with 4 rather than with 3 increases the tension but otherwise the game is dull.

A fairly simple blind-bidding and set-collection game that contains a large dose of screwage and tons of opportunity for king-making, which often are turn-offs for me. However, in 1655 - Habemus Papam, it all seems right in the spirit of the game and works well. It's a mid-length card game that has some nice depth and "feels" meatier than its simple mechanics would indicate at first. The theme here is very rich, and I found myself enjoying this one quite a bit.

One play, 3p. It features a mechanism that doesn't usually appeal to me - "take-that" cards - but not many and they didn't seem to dominate the game. I played most of them, and came last :)

The theme was what originally interested me - the political aspect of a papal election, rather than any religious connection - and though the game's no simulation, it does have a lot of historical flavour. The production is good, the art is OK, there's an info sheet giving the background to the conclave, and the box is an appropriate size for the game length and weight.

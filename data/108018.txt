I've been playing this against AI opponents. Excellent pastime with just mobile phone.

Update Jul-2015:
Finally played face to face with some experienced players. Really fun, also a good beer and pretzels game ;)

You need to be a fan of this game to like and play it. Otherwise it's too much trouble and learning to go through. But with the right group that knows what it's doing, this can be very fun.

My current favorite game. I could play this all day every day. Beautiful asymmetry.

RATING: 8
Very deep, rich game. Lots of complexity in scoring that luckily only one player needs to understand! Still quite a bit of up-front complexity with figuring out yaku, but the game plays incredibly smoothly once everyone has a handle on the basics. Very strategic game with a satisfying amount of variance, and being able to play a couple hands instead of a full game makes it very convenient to pull out even when you're short on time.

Zung Jung is more elegant rules-wise, but Riichi has its own merits.

Riichi is a step backwards for my Mah-Jong needs: more stuff to memorize, more sources of randomness, more things to keep track of, more convoluted scoring. I'd be more likely to try to introduce Zung Jung to my Mah-Jong group, and I'm not sure about that either.

Good gateway of Mahjong-kind to modern Mahjong. But for the balancing and simpleness, I mean fun-factor, I'd pick Zung Jung Mahjong over this.

RATING: 6
Too long and hard to find players, but I like it. Much better than the HK (and some other) rules imo because of the great ability to play defensive. But I don't like the fact that some statistically rare sets are rated lower than they should be, which is afaik fixed in competition (and maybe other) rules.

RATING: 5
A more skillful variant for sure, but so convoluted in it's rules and patterns that I have no joy in it. This variant also rewards defensive and boring play too much it seems.

Riichi Mahjong is a lively, more tactically interesting version of the classic, and I'll happily spend hours playing it, especially if you want to play 3-player, which is an even more break-neck game.

RATING: N/A
set building mostly. appreciate the age/staying power of this game but would sooner play other, more complex things.

RATING: 4
Unnecessarily Byzantine scoring; wild swinginess in scoring; scores for patterns do not correspond to rarity; encourages multi-player solitaire. All these factors make this an inferior mahjong style.

My husband's favourite game. We used to spent whole days playing it with friends but it's hard to find the time for it now we have kids and hard to teach new players

Seems like it could be very interesting if I were better at it.

good game hard to play will a lot of players which is a shame.
nice art work on cards.
easy to learn.
all cards are equaly rated (no rare or commons)

cards you need can be bought from the company in the states at $0.50 each no stupid-crazy prices like most other card games

Should not have been a CCG.  For awhile I was able to get in games of this with some regularity and enjoyed it quite a bit.  But it became difficult to find players who wouldn't rather play something else.  After all even for me it was never going to be a top tier game.  Sometimes I think it might be worth relearning the rules and seeing if I can't get someone to play it with me again.

This is the first of 3 different card games based on different battles of the Civil War. The second is Shiloh, and the third (and the best) is Gettysburg. A forth called Eagles:Waterloo, a Napoleonic game that refines the system. Bull Run, is fairly basic, and could use a updated version along the line of Gettysburg, when it comes to unit structure.

RATING: 7
Own all 3 games in series: Dixie (Bull Run, Gettysburg & Shiloh).  Easy to play and gives a feel (albeit abstracted) for the linear tactics of the era.  Cards provide good insight into the leaders, units and terrain at the various battles.  Teaching my 7 year old son using the "Unified Rules" (available here: http://www.columbiagames.com/resources/3700/dixieunifiedrules.pdf), we tackled Eagles! Waterloo first as I felt the outflank & enfilade rules made the Dixie games marginally more difficult.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Best war card game I have ever played. Tension and back and forth action keep the suspense up the whole game.  Quick to learn but there are some devious tactics available just like in real life.  It's usually fun right up to last die roll.

In a box in Las Cruces

Not a very fun battle to do this game with.  The relative inexperience of all the troops means that almost all the forces are 1s or 2s, and the generals are all pretty mediocre as well.  Still, as the system goes this is not a bad game at all.

Paid it Forward with other Dixie cards + Fortress Europa for Cruel Necessity

I'd like to say more about this game, but the truth is I've barely played it.  I really like the idea of a historical CCG, but I'm not too hot on the art.  With all the civil war reenactors you would think they could do this photographically and do so well.

Dixie series of American Civil War adapting Columbia's Block system to a flexible card game. Bull Run simplest and probably the best. Shilho and Gettysburg are a little more fiddly and the card mix doesn't seem that good...too many leaders.

I really like this game. It's a little more abstract than I would like, but I think it would make the game more complicated than it should be with more simulation added in. The Shiloh version really was a lot of fun. It even included the 2 Union gunboats that were involved in the land battle! I didn't have a chance to play the Gettysburg version. Very neat game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The art work on the cards is brilliant, but there is a lot of luck in the game. I don't agree with the points values for the cards, there is no tradeoff to temper choice of the stronger cards. The latest version of rules have improved gameplay somewhat. Superceded by Shiloh and then Gettysburg, but my 8 year old has enjoyed playing it with me.

Great short game which does a fair-to-good job of simulating warfare in the age of muskets and muzzle-loading rifles.  Cavalry is weak until you get it into melee, artillery is deadly at close range but is near worthless in melee, and infantry is the workhorse, especially the good units.  Units can close to engage with each other and trade fire, but if you want to take that position you're going to have to melee... which is an all-or-nothing attack done as a set of sub-turns.

Leaders rally.  That's all they do.  And be very careful of leaving a leader without any covering unit.

All in all, very enjoyable and quick.  And... it tells a narrative.  What's not to like?

09/10/06 Played Dixie: Bull Run once. The owner had created two equal decks. Otherwise I would have refused to play a CCG. It was a nice game. The box says 30 minutes, yeah, right. Try 1.5 hours. There was some important info they should have put on the cards; there is plently of room. But it seems Columbia felt a painting of a uniform was more important than functionality.

My son and I have had so much fun with this (card) battle game. Easy to learn, fun to play. This would be a 9 if the rule clarifications would become official. Until then, we tend to make our own "logical decisions" and move along. ... Since my first writing, I have had the opportunity to GM this game at the Prezcon 2005. During that experience, I had the chance to help provide several rules clarifications and write a set of "tournament rules". Accordingly, I am raising my old rating of 8 to a 9.

I have all three Dixie editions. The Bull Run edition is my favorite. Shiloh is second but Gettysburg doesn't feel like "the Gettysburg." All in all, the Dixie card games feel more Civil War like than Battle Cry to me. There is a greater variety of unit strengths, artillery types and generals. With my duplicate deck or by combining different sets I've believe it is possible to create any ACW battle to the Dixie format.

[PLEASE NOTE: This rating is for all three of the Dixie games: Bull Run, Shiloh, & Gettysburg] I bought the complete set of this one and it's a pretty good game.  Lots of possibilities.  I must admit, after reading the rules, I thought it would be a complicated game that wasn't much fun.  I would've originally rated it a 4....but after playing it a couple of times it bumped it up to a 5.  Then, after a few more plays, I think the game kindda grew on me.  After actually gaining an understanding of the game, combined with the attractiveness of the cards, I gotta give it a 6.  If you get this game, I'd recommend giving it a real shot and not putting it up on your shelf after the first try.
BTW: I do believe that Gettysburg is the best one of the 3 games.

A fun card game. Quick to play, but lacking depth. I'm an historical wargame fan though, so I find this game fun on occasion. The artwork isn't great, but does attempt to be accurate and adds to the flavor of the game. One of my complaints is that there are no card combos other than applying Special cards to units. My other complaint is that, other the the Eagles expansion, which covers the 1815 Napoleonic campaign, there were no other time periods attempted. Seven Years War, Franco-Prussian War and other Napoleonic battles would have been great.

I enjoyed this game, but had to give up my cards when moving across the Atlantic. Now I'd rather hunt down a copy of Battle Cry rather than this game.

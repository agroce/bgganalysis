One play: I liked this a lot. It is a very simple racing game, with nothing original in the mechanic, but it's nicely designed and thematically everything just works well. The logs float down the stream with the players blocking their way, and there are jams all over the place, while other racers break away for the finish line. I can't see much replayability in it but the game does what it intends extremely well indeed.

RATING: 6
Good for families and those lighter moments in gaming sessions.  Lots of screwage and lots of luck with the card draw.  After you get one piece off of the board it gets so much easier due to the extra wild cards you're allowed.  Fun, but not as deep and interesting as Mississippi Queen, which it resembles just a bit.

A good game to play with kids, as choices are limited and the theme is attractive for them (and for adults).  I find that the game is a little too simple for my tastes, but the short, variable game play is enticing.

Absorbing race game.  Some fun, but can be very direct and therefore not to everyone's taste.  The really clever rule states that you can only win on your turn.  In effect, if you are blocking an opponent, they can push you off in front of them and win the game.  (It happened!)

RATING: 6
In short, a childs game. The randomness of the card draw removes any real scope for applied skill and strategy. If you dont draw the right card (man v girl), then you are pretty well screwed.

A rating of 6 is therefore exceptionally high for me but still a score that should shunt this from my games owned list. However, my daughter is nearly 6 and she loves it. The game gives her enough to think about beyond the roll and move regime she has played so much to date. Where options to shove her father into a back wash arise she grabs them with gusto. 

I am delighted she enjoys playing a board game with her Dad. It wont be long before shes onto the meatier stuff, but this can stay in the collection until she does.

My wife and I had fun playing this.  We played a few times using a few of the different map combinations.  All were fun and really competitive between my wife and I.  I mean, we are generally really competitive people but this game somehow really brought it out in a good way.

RATING: 6
I really like the elegant simplicity of the rules in this race game.  It's got some nice methods for pushing back other players, and contains a bit more strategic decision-making than I originally suspected.  Some of the boards are very hard to get through and could cause some analysis-paralysis if players overthink them.

This is a game where you can directly or indirectly hurt your opponents progress, so you have to play with people who don't have easily-bruised feelings.  I'm interested in exploring more of the boards so I'll be looking for a copy at some point.  It seems like an ideal game for non-gamers because you can make the game as long or as short as you want, and the rules are very straightforward.

Delightful, fun game you can teach anyone to play. Adding to the earlier "kudos" for the geomorphic game boards. The ability to create longer/shorter rivers to race on is a huge plus.

This is really an under rated racing game. It gets a lot more table time than Snow Tails in my group. It is fast like Ave Caesar but it is more open ended and engaging. It's not super deep but you can be clever in positioning and card timing. Each board has different puzzle logic to figure out. There are short cuts to be found and sneaky ways to send your opponents down bad currents. This is a great family game!

I am not a fan of racing games, but this is an OK one. Rather like Ave Caesar but with rather more variety in the boards, the cards and the opportunities to block and push opponents into trouble. Also the ability to push one of your pawns with the other. Fun and not too long.

Provisional rating after 1 play. Simplest race game I know, that has tons of room for screwage, good play, and game to game variability. How has this clean of a system not been done before? Looking forward to trying with more people.

Edit: Played at lunch with 5. Just a great, simple, interactive game. Why doesn't this get more run?

RATING: 6.5
An evil little race game.  Very quick but if you want longer it can be done by adding more boards.  Played with two but would be absolutely cutthroat with five.  Artwork and theme are cool, as well.  AS my son said, he hasn't played a bad game by Friedman and knew off the bat who it was by just from the artwork.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
An okay but simplistic race game.  It has some strategic elements (such as pushing logs and riding waves/currents), but you only get 3 movement cards (and they move specific pieces) so the game is luck heavy.

Note: I didn't like the long 7-hex wave at the end of one of the race courses.

Feels like a river themed version of Ave Caesar - without the need to pit.

Experience depends on the players and the course you build, but there is lots of variety in the boards given in the box.

Quite interactive (depends on the course) and probably too chaotic and 'nasty' for some - with 4/5 players you can get your log riders pushed way back before your turn comes around again.

But I like it ... there again I like Ave Caesar too (original, not the muffed reprint).

RATING: 7
Very simple and basic racing game that maintains interest due to the high "screw-you" factor of shoving the other players around in order to jostle them into crappy board positions.  The potential for nastiness here is very high, and that jockeying for position is really what makes this one shine, even though the base mechanisms are nothing all that new or exciting.  I think it definitely hits it's mark as a gateway type of game that can be played with either gamers or non-gamers and still be enjoyed by both.  I also like how all the included board sections allowed for a variety of courses to race on from game to game.

What a great little game. Many different boards to make the river courses to run down. Essential a race game but with great chance from screwing with your opponents by pushing a log in their way or pushing them into a river current going the wrong. Really enjoyed this one. 1 Play

Fast Flowing Forest Fellers is a racing game by Friedman Friese. How's that for "F"s!

After one play, I had a rather ho-hum reaction to this one. I'm not opposed to racing games, but this one fell a bit flat. The unique thing FFFF seems to offer is the shoving of player's pawns and logs to create some chains of movement, but I found this aspect mildly frustrating. Maybe it's different if played with less players (we played with five), but I'll play this again only to be polite.

This is at its heart an abstract game, but the theme has been nicely implemented.  What I think is best in this game is the chance for variation.

Nice quick easy race game. It looks like you only use 2 of the board in each game. Whether that's how you supposed to do it. It's how I'd suggest. There's a different track each time. I'm not sure how much the logs will get in the way, but I haven't played any log heavy boards. You have 2 or 3 lumberjacks, so they can work together or split up. A few light choices without having to plan too far ahead.

Good, fast and light racing game for the kids. Perhaps a bit too evil at times when they push each other into a stream that drags them back for half a game board. Much wailing is heard at times.

Update: Played it with some friends and oh my what a cruel game this is. It took us the better part of one hour just to get past the first map piece since all of us kept pushing the other players into a backward flowing stream. We had a great time!

RATING: 6
Simple race game where players are vying to be the first to get their man and woman pieces down the rapids and across the finish line.  Players take turns playing a card from their mini-hand of three.  Cards move either the man or woman and listed number of spaces.  Movement is down the river (walking on water?), bumping other people and logs out of the way, and into the way of trouble (hopefully).  Pieces that end up on currents move on their own at the end of the turn.  Simple to play... reminds me of many other games ... Robo-Rally, Mississippi Queen, to name a few.  Harmless fun.

RATING: 8
While this is a very simple family-weight game, I really enjoy the playing-out of the cards and the pushing and the bumping. There's a little bit of strategy to your card-holding, a little strategy of who to target when you're pushing, a little spatial strategy of blocking the chokepoints, and a little strategy of managing your discard when you reshuffle. Each element individually doesn't add much, but added all together it creates a nice little game that's I find enjoyable to just play out. I've heard card-game players discuss the pleasure of playing out a hand -even if a lot of decisions are obvious, there's some subtleties that make each game unique and force you to think a bit -I feel the same way about Fast Flowing Forest Fellers. The game also scales well and comes with enough boards to shake up the game a bit each time you play. What's not to love?

FF's Ave Caesar inspired racing game is all about chaos and pushing. My verdict is still out if this game is better than Ave Caesar. It's probably better at 3 or 4, but inferior at 5 or 6. There's definately a lot more replayability. The theme and mechanics, specifically currents, logs, and pushing match really well with the theme.

Recently, I've decided to thin down on racing games. FFFF is on the short list of games that I'm going to keep from that genre. 

Update. I do not own Ave Caesar anymore, but I have held onto FFFF. I guess that shows which one I really prefer.

This is a fantastic racing game from Friedemann Friese that doesn't seem to have as much publicity on BGG as it deserves. Great components, solid theme, easy to learn, and very fun to play - it has all the essential elements of being a terrific family game.  Will your forest fellers (logging crew) make their way down their river before those of your opponents do?

Surprisingly good game for such a simple mechanism. You play movement cards to send you people down river, bump logs and other people, and get pushed around by the currents and eddies. And that's the trick, negotiating these eddies succesfully, and bumping the others into time wasting whirlpools. Definitely play again, very quick to work out, very simple to learn.

A very whimsical game that's easy to learn. 

You build your own river, then race down it to see who gets to the end first. Just watch for the river currents along the way which might send you (or an opponent) somewhere you don't want to go.

Simple, elegant fun for the whole family and a great party game!

RATING: 7
I do appreciate games that give some bang for the buck--double sided game board pieces fit together in many combinations so that the game board has numerous layouts.  This also lets you dictate the length of the game.  Rules are short and easy.  Lots of player interaction.  Clever title, clever pieces.  The theme works well with the mechanics; The loggers get caught in log jams and currents.

Played the game with 3, and didn't enjoy, then played it with 5 and was a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This wins me over if only for the vast modularity of the game.  I'ld have to play tons of games before the same combinations of boards and players shows up twice.  Our first session with two players was a lot of fun and the continuous jockeying for key choke points at river bends was neat.  This can only get more chaotic with more players on the board.  This would be the bastard son of Ave Caesar and Canyon.  But in a good way.

I'm a sucker for racing games, and originally themed ones even get an extra plus. Add modification, variation, screwage, an interesting publisher and loads of FUN to it, and you'll understand why I'm rating this game well above average. In fact, I wonder why am I not even rating this higher ?

But perhaps some of the boards make a less interesting section, they could easily have added even more boards and perhaps the major gripe is that the moment you made one character finish all his cards can be used as a joker, which is too much of an advantage. I would change this into : other character cards can be used to move an other character with a penalty of -2.

So far I only tried one 4-player game, and the endgame was pretty interesting, as I had to stop one player from winning and had to sacrifice my own chances for it, so numbers three & four managed to fight back and the one even screwing least eventually surprisingly won the game ! While I still had a good chance to win as well though I still had 2 characters left in the race while all others only had one remaining. Especially this final aspect was pretty unexpected & felt rather unique. I could easily have gone for second place, not bothering about the leading player, but what would have been the fun of that ? ;o)

EDIT 2012 : brought down from 8 to 7 after a rather boring 2 player game.

I love a good racing game and this is definitely one of them. The fact that you have multiple logs really makes the game fun. Pushing other people is more fun than it should be.

The rules are super easy and can be explained in e minute. The components are good and the maps look really fun.

A very light game with lumberjacks racing down a stream. With its simple mechanics (play a card, move lumberjack, draw a card) I can see this working fine with casual gamers or in a family environment even if it does contain a considerable take that element.

For more ambitious gaming there are two major issues. For one, it's almost too simple with too few constraints on where you can go. Then, there are factors which can make the game drag a lot. On some boards it's the confined space where it's easy to dam the entire river, on others it's the currents which, if played competitively, will result in a lot of back-and-forth without anybody gaining any ground.

I need more plays of this one. It is a fun game and I like the way you can plan your log pushes to bump other opponents meeples. It's a cut throat little game, no doubt, so some may not like it. Lots of luck involved with the card deck draws. In my first game, most of the Red Meeple cards for the female character were at the bottom of the deck. So she became a straggler at the end of the race.

I really like this game - it's fun, fast flowing and full of fiendish obstacles to get by. The mini logs to push out of the way as you go down the river are great. And who doesn't like a game where you can push your opponent all the way back down the board using the currents.

An original racing game with a twist. Some randomness (the cards) gives a little chance to win literally everyone but planning plays an important role. The modular board (12 pieces) gives the necessary variability.

A very good filler game.  You are racing down a river and bumping other players into different hazards.  Some boards can be very tedious if there are a lot of logs and flows.  Other boards can be too bland if there aren't enough flows and logs and its just a race of who draws the best cards.  Another problem is that half the time, you will know who is going to win about halfway through.

Fun-stupid game? Was pleasantly surprised when this hit the table. Combine the chaos of Robo Rally, and the water-flowing feel of Niagara, and you've got this wacky, silly, stupid, but hysterically funny, and most of all, fun racing game.

It seems to have plenty of expansion boards, so the silliness keeps going.

Update (10/09/09): Not to be taken seriously. However, it has elements of deep tactical play and player interaction, through I-screw-you/You-screw-me and I-scratch-your-back/You-scratch-mine dynamics. It could also play like chess (although without the perfect information), if you wanted to.

Another game to play with my children.  This is simpler than "duck! duck! Go!" but similar in that you use a select from a random hand of cards each turn to move your pieces.  It is made fun because the adaptable boards have currents which you can use to give yourself a boost, or you can nudge your opponents into to send them back in the wrong direction!  Floating logs behave like other player pieces and serve to add congestion and chaos.  Playable by even my three year old with a little assistance, whereas ddG was a little too tricky for him.

First played January 7th, 2009. It's a mix of Missippi Queen and Niagra Falls. Taught in 5 minutes and takes about 30 minutes to play with 3 players. Each player gets a set of 8 movement (1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5) cards for each of the pawns they get. You also get one wild card. Shuffle your cards together and draw 3. On your turn play one and draw one. Shuffle the deck if you run out. You may move one hex per movement, however can forgo a movement. You can push up to two objects (log or player) in front of you as long as they have a place to go. If you (or anyone) lands on "fast water" at the end of your turn, that pawn moves to the next tile (and so on if it pushes again). First to get all three pawns to the finish wins. It's a fun game, however I wouldn't recommend buying it. Try a borrow or a play a a game shop.

Fast Flowing Forest Fellers (say that five times fast) is an excellent, extremely simple game.  I love how there's confined strategy.  What I mean is, at any time you can only move one piece and you can only choose from three cards.  There's plenty of "looking ahead", planning your next move and hoping it doesn't get taken off track by your opponents.  It's a really special game.  Add to that the modular boards and those awesome little logs, you've got yourself a winner.

RATING: 6
A slow race game where you seem to get pushed backward almost as much as forward. There are two tricks to this game that make it a bit "thinky". First are the currents, which, if you end your turn on them can carry you in good or bad directions (usually bad). Second is the ability to push other pieces and logs, which can block or interfere. You can push your own pieces forward, thus moving two or more pieces with one card, or you can push other players into currents which can send them back. The key seems to be using your cards efficiently through pushing. Not a great racing game, but a decent sort of light puzzle game for the family.

This is a nice family racing game with some light strategy. You have three cards from your deck and select one to play moving the number of spaces on the board. Some of the strategy is in how you use your piece to push the other pieces. There are some currents that after a move can help or hurt you or other players. My older son liked that there are other boards so you change the length of the race. My younger son liked that it wasn't too long.

RATING: 7
This game of Friedemann came as a surprise to me. So far his only game I really liked was Power Grid. As this race game was released together with strong competitors as Snow Tails and Powerboats and didn't get much of a buzz I didn't expect much as well. It turned out to be a fun game which can measure up to its bigger opponents. It is the lightest of the three which is not necessarily a bad thing as it also plays the fastest. It also has the strongest "take that" component of the three games. Usually, I don't enjoy this too much but here it really adds enjoyment. For the long run, Snow Tails probably is the best gamers choice but for the first game this was as good.
There are a few quirks though. Especially white and yellow colours are hard to distinguish in dim light which can matter a lot as in some player constellations one player has white and yellow playing pieces and cards (cost savings create an awkward game feeling here - it just doesn't feel right to play two blue and one red piece because the publisher wanted to save costs by not including three blue pieces for a three-player game). The same goes for male and female loggers. It will happen that players move the wrong pawn with their card.

Race game involving a bit of pushing which is a fun dynamic.  Plays much like Ave Caesar with a little more aggressiveness and at least two racers with separate set of cards mixed together for each.

I greatly recommend this game if you're after a fun lightweight game with a strong theme. Sure it's not the most strategic game in the world but it more than makes up for it in fun. We've had good laughs every time we played and there's nothing as satisfying as seeing your opponent caught in a current and going back a long way or being stuck behind a huge pile of logs. And when I say logs, I mean real miniature logs! The components are so nice you really get into the spirit of the game.

Finally, my wife loves it and likes the fact there are some female lumberjacks! And she loves Canada too, so it is definitely a hit in our household.

Another addition to the stable of quick racing games with variable board setups. Strong points are the team aspect and the wood pile-ups on the final map as an elegant solution to the leader breakaway problem that tends to curse these games. The single but fatal weak point for me is that it’s not RoboRally.

Ignore the suggestion in the rules that you start with a simple board layout, dive in with a mad complex layout, and enjoy.  A great knockabout game for families, currently enjoyed by adults, 5 and 8 year old and very "again, again!" popular.  Recommended - particularly at the £7.99 discount price on the Works, as quality of components and replay ability well deserves the rather higher list price.  Underrated and rather fabulous.  The mechanic ensures constant cutthroat tactical play, right to the final moves.

Another extremely average race game... 

Our game got very bogged down on the final card/leg of the race... one step forward and eight back it seemed...  Although I won it didn't feel like I did anything clever to deserve the win.  

Certain spots on each map board seem to be relatively "safe".  The first person to figure the safe spots has a big advantage.

Very average... today's games need to be more than that imo.

I think this is kind of a RoboRally-lite - it's a game about shoving your own guys forward and the other players' guys into trouble. Efficient and intelligent use of your cards is limited by the fact that you only have 3 in your hand at one time, and you play one rather than run a more complex "program".

Initial rating after 1 play with 5:

The new Friedeman. 1st play was disappointing. Felt too much filler and too low on tactics. Strategy didn't seem to be necessary.

Update after 2 more plays with 2:
I thought having a go at boards with more woodpieces floating around would be more fun. But it only gives the illusion of more gameplay.

Don't know why others are raving about this luck driven family filler. I usually like Friedeman's games, but this one doesn't get me. 60% luck + 25% take that + 15% tactics = onto the tradepile!

UPDATE: Traded away for Seenot im Rettungsboot (Lifeboats) which I like a lot more!

A race on logs has players managing teams of two.  If your team works together you'll have a huge advantage (you can push each other forward).  To win though you'll need to figure out a way to block your opponents or push them out of the way.  Not drawing the cards you need or finding yourself in a poor position can be frustrating but hopefully you'll keep it to a minimum and if you can't the game will be over shortly.

Quite enjoyable gateway-type game. I got it because I can play it with different numbers of players, and with different kinds of folks, and with that in mind, it delivers. You want more logs? Fine, we can play a board with more logs. Is it [gameid=18], Jr.? You can't do as much planning, but there's enough so that you're still paying attention when it's not your turn. Pushing your own guys/gals is key. Looking forward to trying different boards and different numbers of players.

both my plays of this to date have resulted in people throwing away an outright victory just so they can knock an opponent back down the rapids! This is more of a "take that" style game than a serious race game. Players seem to get more fun out of just attcking each other as opposed of striking out for a win!
It is good fun, but I doubt it will have a great deal of re-play value.

Each player aims to guide a team of lumberjack rollers down a river complete with turns and rapids to be the first to get all team members past the finish line. 

FFFF uses a set of like decks to determine movement each turn and then bottlenecks and several movement rules determine how the log rollers are held up or affect other rollers around them.

Léger mais amusant en fin de soirée. Actuellement à 6.55/10, je lui donne 6.7.

EDIT: À éviter avec certains types de joueurs plus sensibles. Le coeur de la stratégie est d'optimiser nos cartes d'actions en poussant l'un de nos draveurs sur un autre de nos draveurs. Ainsi, deux de nos draveurs se déplacent simultanément. 

Toutefois, dans plusieurs occasions, le coup le plus optimal sera de s'en prendre directement aux draveurs adverses! À mes yeux, c'est rigolo. Mais certains peuvent s'offusquer!

EDIT: Mon neveu de 5 ans et demi y joue très bien! Aussi j'ai voté "5 ans et plus" pour le "User Suggested Ages".

A racing game with deceivingly simple rules. Don't dismiss the game based on the rulebook; The actual gameplay value comes from the boards. Together with the pushing mechanism, the board elements create a very clever balancing system, and lots of interesting situations.

The non-existent hand management part is my main problem with the game. Even with the ingenious balancing system, getting a long streak of bad cards might just bury you.

A pleasant racing game, but can get chaotic. Keep the race track short with few contra-flow arrows or it will take too long for what it is. After 20-30 minutes it will get repetitive: you do essentially the same things on the last turn of the game that you did on the first turn, and all of the turns in between.

Looks like a solid family game. Lookimg forward to trying it. Friday is such a clever game, that am looking forward to playing more of Friedman's games.

2plays: Ok, I really enjoyed this game and so did everyone else. It does what it sets out to do perfectly, a nice family race game with nice player interaction and lots of modularity. The artwork is charming, the components are top tier, it plays quickly, and the rulebook is very simple and clear. The gameplay itself is super elegant and a lot of fun, seems like an easy to play hard to master sort of thing. The shoving in particular is an absolute blast and imo, the highlight of the game. You get to bump up to two different figures on your turn (either one of yours, another player's or a Log). So that creates a lot of cool chains where you can use a small movement card and yield more results from it. Because you can also end your turn on a current, there's a possibility that you can advance even farther and block other players. There's nothing more satisfying than shoving an opponent into a current that'll take them back the stream, and lose them a lot of progress in the process. Am very happy with this one, it really fires on all cylinders for us. We didn't have any race games either, so it's perfect. With a lot of modularity to increase replay value, a charming theme and simple gameplay that can be used with non-gamers, and a deeeper game hidden underneath once experience kicks in, we've got a winner. Oh and did I mention that it plays fast? 3p game was half an hour.

Friese első igazán ötlettelen játéka. Rengeteg hasonló játék van a piacon, talán a témája az egyetlen egyedi faktora. Mondjuk elsőre pár dolgot rosszul játszottunk és ez jelentősen a játékélmény rovására ment, de biztos vagyok benne, hogy lesz meg újabb esély a kipróbálására.  (6)
Először bocsánatot kérek az előző hozzászólásomért, a játék igenis jó, szórakoztató és egyedi, csak jó szabályok szerint kell játszani. Ami nekem hiányzott az első két partiból, hogy egymást is lehet lökdösni, az benne van az eredeti szabályokban. Izgalmas és sok nevetéssel tarkított játékmenet lett így belőle.

RATING: 7
This is a cute race game, where players are trying to float their two co-ed loggers down a stream on some logs. Log jams will occur, which is part of the fun. Since loggers can bump into each other, they can push other loggers in different directions. Sometimes loggers get caught in a backward flowing stream. Occasionally you can get your loggers to help each other along.

You play cards to move your loggers, each card specifies how far you can move and which logger to move. The beaver card is a singular wildcard that lets you move either logger three spaces -- save it until you need it! Overall very light, simple and family fun.

I prefer a little more depth to my racing games, like Snow Tails or perhaps Mississippi Queen, but this goes fairly fast so it makes fine filler. (Notice what I did there with the Fs?) Rating a 7 initially but may climb up to a 7.5 after more plays.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun and fast (at least, with the introductory race course) race game in the draw-one-play-one genre. The challenge here is:
- dealing with the luck of the draw (hand management, similar to Snow Tails)
- figuring out how to push others backwards (either yourself, or by putting them in spaces with backward-moving currents)
- figuring out how to place yourself to minimize the chances of others doing the above to you!

Definitely worthy of more plays. Should be easy enough to play with non-gamers, too.

--- Summary ---
Create a race course using the modular boards, which are made of hexes of either open water, water with a current (often backwards!), and logs. Place little log-eeples on the appropriate spaces. Players each shuffle their decks of movement cards (with cards for the male and female meeple, numbered 1-5, and one wild 3) and draw a hand of 3. Racers start off the board and will enter from specific locations; movement to different boards is also at specific points (and one-way). On your turn, play a card to move the matching meeple up to the number of spaces on the card; can push up to 2 meeple/logs in the direction you're moving (but not off board or onto rocks). After moving, the currents move all players to the end of the current stream (sort of like a RoboRally super-express conveyer). Draw a card. the first player to get both their racers through the race course wins!

RATING: 7.5
A perfect racing game would simulate the physics and hazards of racing with a very simple rule set, would have a bit of a "push your luck" element where racing on the edge would come with greater risks, would not have any "runaway leader" issues but would allow players to interfere with/block each other, would have a variety of tracks to race upon, would have fast and fun game play, and would have an element of carnage and mayhem.  "Formula De Mini" has a very clever "gear dice" mechanism and does a great job of simulating damage and the risks of going too fast in a simple manner, but contains too much counting of spaces, has not enough variability in track options and too few meaningful decisions, and drags on a bit long.  "Um Reifenbreit" does an amazing job with recreating a bicycle race with simple rules and has a small variety of race routes to choose from, but it too has few interesting decisions since it relies mainly on dice rolls, and to get the most out of the game requires a lap around the full board with 4 players, which can drag on a little long.  "Fast Flowing Forest Fellers" (FFFF), however, while it does have a fair bit of the "luck of the draw" with card play and no real "push your luck" element (other than taking chances with positioning near currents), but it has more player interaction than most race games I've experienced, it has a HUGE variety of river configurations that can be created (which creates high replayability), and, most importantly for a race game, it plays fast and fun while providing players with enough meaningful decisions to keep things interesting.  It is wonderfully easy to learn, and doesn't overstay it's welcome (and if it does, you can only blame yourself for creating such a long, difficult course!).  I'll see how the rating holds up over time, but it leaves a very good first impression.  And finally, a minor "runaway leader" problem is easily remedied with a simple variant: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/5290066#5290066.

This solves the latter problem, but I haven't decided for certain whether it solves the former.  I don't know if it's closer to RoboRally or [my perceptions of] duck! duck! go!

There's not a single innovative idea here (even the concept of a racing game is old news) -- but we end up with a masterful combination of old, yet solid ideas that results in an exciting, fun experience that feels fresh. Don't look for anything particularly deep; we are in absolute family territory here. What really sells the game is it's modularity. There are so many possible maps you can make. A winner.

Simplistic card-driven race game. The object is to transport two or three lumberjacks (dependent on the number of players) from one end of a river to the other. The first player to get all their pieces to the end is the winner. In order to do this cards depicting the number of spaces a piece can move are played and other pieces can be pushed out of the way. At the end of the move any pieces standing on a current space are transported in the direction of the current (either upstream or downstream). The current provides the one area of any real strategy to the game as players attempt to push their own pieces onto downstream currents making their moves more efficient, and their opponents onto upstream ones thereby setting them back, but overall there's very little depth here.

Race games are rarely anything to take note of and this is a mediocre entry in a mediocre class. The blocking is mildly interesting, but the game seems to come down to drawing the right cards at the right time.

I feel like there are other more compelling racing games out there.  It won't find a place on my shelf, but it is a lighthearted fast playing easy to learn race game which has a modular board.

There is also a good bit of screw factor in it as well, which could make it very entertaining for certain groups to play.

Had the opportunity to play this twice in one night.  Not a bad game - but there wasn't really much to help it to stand out from a large crowed of other racing games.  It is one of the better of the light one I have tried however.

Really prefer it with tougher routes (more logs). The mechanic of the leader having to move the logs so those lagging get a more direct route is really good – you need to try and risk being second or third and letting someone else do the grunt work!

07 JUL 2009 - Played at GameStorm 2009 and we had a blast! It's a really fun race game with lots of ways to mess with the other players (and often times it backfires on you or they can get you right back, esp. when playing with multiple people).

At its core, this is simply a silly race game, and yet the fun factor is really high here.  The way the lumberjacks jostle for position and shove each other into currents, which in turn can push others out of the way, makes for a fun and funny game.  There are several game boards that are modular, so there can be many, many different configurations.

Finally after 3 years got this one.
Never bought it because I already had Snow tails as Card-driven racing game. But my wife hates those dogs, so I got her logs...
I also enjoy this one. The important thing is to pick the right layout depending on the skills of the players.

What do you get when you cross Ave Caesar with Mississippi Queen?  Fast Flowing Forest Fellers is less appealing than that geneaology implies.  There's plenty to analyze on the board but instead of feeling like a game, it feels like a Rubick's cube. How do I push all of this stuff around so I can solve the puzzle and get on to the next part of my day?

Diamonds Club's mediocrity beats out Fast Flowing Forest Fellers misery by a long shot. Having disliked most Friese games that I've tried and having disliked most racing games that I've tried, I should've known going in that this one might not be for me, but I'm always happy to try any game once or twice, and I was hoping that this game might be fast and light enough to be enjoyable. Unfortunately it's light enough for sure, really too light in terms of rules, but not fast enough by a long shot. It's a ridiculous exercise of constantly taking two steps forward and one step back, or maybe three steps back, and thus painfully inching your way towards your goal.

A huge thumbs up for making all the boards double sided.

Pretty good racing game with lots of opportunity to screw other players during your turn. Highly interactive. There are only a few rules, and they are easy to explain, so it is easy to get the game to the table with nongamers and even children. You need to be in the mood for some screwage though. Except for the aim of the game (reaching the end of the board as fast as possible), this game has absolutely nothing in common with Snow Tails or Formula D - it plays very, very differently! I do not care too much for the artwork and components (although they are functional), but girlfriend does.

Light race game, where players play a numbered card from their hand, then move their corresponding racer down the river that many spaces. First player to get all his racers to the end wins the game. River currents and logs complicate matters, as you can get pushed into back eddies or end up in areas where you can't move because it's too clogged with logs.

The game is very light, and plays very quickly. It's "I'll play this card, move 1,2,3,4 spaces, push this log here, which flows to here and here, your turn."

Not something I'll pull off the shelf a lot, but it's a fun way to end an evening of heavier games.

The word 'fast' in the title of this game is a complete misnomer- the game is plodding and overstays it's welcome considerably in my view. It is one of those games where towards the end people just stop each other from winning, until someone eventually pulls ahead and wins, at which point no one even cares anymore. I'm always on the lookout for a good racing game and it was sad to see this disappoint so thoroughly.

This racing game gets better with more players and meaner gameplay.  Best with adults, to be sure - unless you don't like your kids!

Update:

Just like Snow Tails, this game suffers in the ratings because of the ho-hum introductory board.  Skip it, and go directly to the crowded boards that are chock full of logs and currents.  Empty space is dull.

RATING: 9
Excellent racing game, and a great "gateway" game.

It's somewhat similar to Snow Tails, but where that one is fairly strategic this is much more tactical.   You really don't need to plan your moves very far ahead of time, and you have a lot more flexibility when things go horribly wrong.   That makes it a lot more friendly to non-gamers or anyone that despises having to do basic math.

The modular boards allow for lots of different setups with a variety of different "difficulty" levels.

A racing game of lumberjacks (and lumberjills). Silly and light -- not a lot to it, really -- but enjoyable, and surprisingly clever and tactical. Pushing logs and other players can be fun, but what really makes it IMO are the currents which can carry you far back or help you on your way.

A family game, real fun and a lot of laughs, but why the box is so big?? please, the next edition make an small modular board. The difference with Finstere Flure by the same author are the movement cards that gives more luck but also the possibility to follow an strategy.

Un juego familiar, dversión real y lleno de risas, pero, ¿porqué es tan grande la caja? por favor, en la proxima edición hagan un tablero de modulos pequeños. La diferencia con el Finstere Flure, del mismo autor, es que las cartas de movimiento añaden más suerte, pero también la posibilidad de seguir una estrategia.

(Trade Interest: low) not a terrible game, and quick and easy to learn, but there's really not much there to grasp.  the game is too easily thrown to the leaders if the all players don't participate in the "take that" style of game play required.  maybe good for a few plays, but i'd much rather play Fearsome Floors, or Mississippi Queen.

Simplicity in design at its best.  No need to worry about crashing into another racer, or what gears to change to, or how much energy to spend.  The high screwage factor makes the game more interactive, but has the potential of being targeted just for the sake of it, not because you are actually doing well to warrant it.  I'm also not exactly impressed by the diminished significance of the trees in the second half of our race.  It sure made pushing easier to figure out, but it also meant that there was very little you can do to affect others, especially the ones in front.  If you prefer your racing games light without too many rules, this one is probably right up your alley.

Simple but easy-going racing game that has a nice amount of variety in its setup while suffering from a lack of variety in its play experience. There are better racing games in a similar vein (Powerboats, Snow Tails) but if racing is a genre you enjoy, especially simple racing games, try it.

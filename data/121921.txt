08-12-14: This one is a good game, but a bit of a letdown. I bought into the BGG hype but the game itself felt much more like hard work than a game (i.e. FUN). And by hard work, I don't mean the hard but rewarding kind, but more of the boring, tedious kind. I'd give it another shot.

UPDATED 4-27-15: After having played two other Ignacy games since first playing this game a year ago, I think the quote above "the game itself felt much more like hard work than a game" could apply to all of them. Witcher I have no desire to play again, at all. Imperial Settlers I'll try again, but with only 2 players. Robinson Crusoe feels like I'm doing my taxes, but at least when I do my taxes I have the reward of receiving a refund a few weeks later.

Got a chance to play this with 3 and really enjoyed it.  A longer game, but I felt the theme came through extremely well, and the game was challenging and interesting.  Will absolutely be picking it up when it comes out in America.

I'm convinced there's a fun game in here...
Rule book is unfortunately, terrible. Mechanics get totally in the way of the flow until you know exactly how it goes.  We house rule everything that comes up and research it later, otherwise you're stopping all the time, until you know it all cold.  Tough scenarios - seemingly great replayability. Wife will not play under any circumstances, haha.

Update - 6 months in.  Definitely enjoy it, now that the mechanics are second nature.  Love the replay value and the unpredictability.  Winning always feels like an accomplishment.

Great thematic game.  Tough as nails. I always feel that the theme comes out of the woodwork on this game.. each scenario feels truly unique and plays out differently.  

I don't mind losing to this game, because I am making tough decisions and enjoy the challenge and story that we tell along the way.

JUEGAZO. Aún tengo que probar más juegos cooperativos, pero este juego es bestial, tanto en reglas, en componentes, y como en experiencia. Logras cumplir tus objetivos (si es que lo logras) con el agua al cuello, y es raro ganar en tus primeras partidas de los distintos escenarios. Simplemente me encanta.

I am enjoying this game because its new to me. However, I already feel that it is not as good as something like Ghost Stories. It is less concise than the aforementioned game. It is also less tense and does not flow as well. 

I would say that it is very similar to Shadowrift overall. I doubt that this will be a keeper for me...

I think there's a lot to explore here (no pun intended). It offers something truly thematic, whilst utilising many of the Euro-mechanics I am always drawn towards in a game. The production is of a high quality, but the rulebook is terrible.

I traded this away. It's a good game, but it suffers from the same "problem" as D-Day Dice. Unless you invest time in playing through the scenarios in sequence with the same players over and over (or play solitaire), you never get the opportunity to move on past Scenario 1 or 2. I play a lot with new players, so this sort of game doesn't suit me well.

Traded for Catacombs with 2 expansions, and no regrets.

RATING: 10
Loving the thematic game style. Scenarios 1-4,6 feel balanced with a great challenge. Scenario 5, Cannibals is difficult in a luck factor way and my least favorite. Tough to teach new players as it can be very easy for alpha player to take over the cooperative decisions.

RATING: 8
Great solo play with up to four characters, many scenarios that are actually different, very good. One little tip, if you like me, have hard times win the first scenario already, dont stuck with it and try other scenarios, makes more fun and later return.

RATING: 8
How many bad things can happen to survivors on an island? Turns out -quite a few. I mean, we are talking about a cursed island here. Maybe it should be called Cursing Island?

There are survival games and then there is Robinson Crusoe. This isn't your typical cooperative game of trying to get the objective before time runs out. This is a slog. This is a fistfight against nature. Every decision matters and every successful die roll is cause for celebration. The pain starts early and never relents, as you lose health from every direction. That moment you build the shelter is a huge relief. When you finally get the roof up, you'll be dancing around for joy. Every moment in between is a time of nerve-wrecking hair loss.

There are six scenarios that come with the game that wildly change the feeling of how to approach your goals. However, the basic laws still apply and you'll only be successful if you prioritize well and take some risks. Playing safe on the Cursed Island only prolongs your suffering. The theme is incredibly strong, as you find yourself having to choose between food and warmth, between shelter and the wood pile, between morale and construction. The only easy decision about Robinson Crusoe is that you must add it to your collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The 7 rating is generous here.  Even after finally mastering the rules, I never really found this to be very immersive.  I also found the wild unpredictability annoying for such a difficult game to learn.  I came within a couple of die rolls of beating the hardest scenario, set it up and played it again with an almost identical strategy...and died in about the third round.

This is one of the only games I've played solo.  One play with 4 players and several on my own.

UPDATE : Lowered the rating to a 5.  There was just too much that was frustrating about the game.  While there were some positives, they get overshadowed by too many negatives.

RATING: 10
This is probably the most thematic game I own. It so perfectly captures being stranded on a desert island, the thrill of discovering something that'll save you, the crushing dread of a giant wild animal attacking you and then the deflation of defeat when he comes back several turns later to eat your food too. The rules are written terribly but I ignore this so readily because the different parts work together so well and we just get lost in the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Excellent co-op. Feels very thematic, invites loads of discussion around the table and is exceedingly challenging. It is a sandbox game for sure (with sand!). My only concern now is the difficulty. Is it even possible to defeat this game? The first scenario, maybe so. But the others? No way unless the cards fall exactly right and the dice do not betray you. Some might enjoy the brutality, but I find I give up after a few crushing defeats. It feels like the game shouts a playground dare - one that I am just not willing to take up too often.

Not my thing definitely. I tried to enjoy it but I never got the impression that it was more than a puzzle that you could play on your own. I didn't feel the thematic sense and I couldn't even finish my second game because I was getting bored.

Seeing how many people like Robinson Crusoe, I think that everything is about one's preferences about games.

I've got really mixed feelings over this one. The theme can't get much better, but somehow the cluttered set of rules stand in the way of immersion. Instead of pondering what's best for survival, you spend your time trying to figure out how the book keeping works and what is written on all the cards. Furthermore, there are certain actions that are absolute necessities, but why make execution of those actions too complicated. Take hunting for an example. Thematically it makes sense, that you first have to track down the animals before hunting them down. But for gameplay, it just makes it too complicated. 

I guess Robinson Crusoe will get better after half a dozen of games under your belt, but considering its length, I just do not see myself playing often enough.

Here is my tip for all you designers out there making thematic games. Keep the rules fairly simple and ask yourself whether you could streamline the rules so that things are accomplished with single actions instead of small incremental ones. Ask the play testers, whether they actually felt like being in the game instead of trying to figure out, in which order to perform things.

Robinson Crusoe is by no means broken, and I could play again. It is just a bit too fiddly for my taste of thematic co-ops. But at least it's better than Castaways, which is a half finished product compared to this one.

I have to add that this game can be ridiculously hard to the point that it is not enjoyable anymore. I love challenges and I do not mind losing. However, I do want to feel that, despite failing in the end, I gave a valiant effort and made some progress at least. 

My experiences with Crusoe have sometimes been quite far from this. Whatever improvements or progress we have made has been immediately snatched away by random events. You build a shovel only for it to break. You build a fire only for rain to quench it. You find food only for you to swallow your own tongue. Then halfway through the game you realise that it is mathematically impossible for you to win anymore even if bad things stopped. And this can happen even if you play a perfect game. It just seems that it takes more to beat a perfect storm. Thus I have come to suspect you have to have all the stars align on the first couple of rounds to even have a slightest of chance of winning. If this is really true, it certainly is not a good thing that a 2-3 hour game is decided during the first 20 minutes but you still have play it till the bitter end.

RATING: 6
+Highly thematic.
+Gives players lots of freedom to work together in a meaningful way.
+The game responds to what the players do through event cards geared towards the actions the players take.
+Multiple scenarios offer numerous ways to play and keep the game fresh.  The designer has already released a new print-and-play scenario free of charge!
+Lots and lots of events and treasures mean you will very rarely see the same ones pop up.

=Some "interesting" translations on some cards and other components.  Usually these aren't enough to make the cards/components unplayable.
=There are a lot of little rules to remember in this game, which means it's easy to not play entirely correctly.
=This game is VERY hard.  I haven't yet decided if it's TOO hard, but it's close.  I don't mind games with a steep learning curve, but I'm concerned this one is simply designed to make even the best players lose more often than not.  With shorter games, I don't mind losing fairly often because I have time to try again, but with a longer game like this one, I'd at least like to have a 50/50 chance of winning with competent play.

-The game feels highly chaotic and random.  Winning seems more about luck than good strategy.
-The rulebook is terrible.  Very poor translation with lots of grammatical errors and typos.  I can understand problems with translation, but how hard is it to catch "Ilsand"?
-Even ignoring translation issues, the rules are still lacking important details and are not well laid out.
-There are only 4 player roles in the game, and 1 of them is only supposed to be used for 4 players.  The rest of the game has a lot of variety, but it seems they skimped on perhaps the most important part for adding to replayability.
-The tokens are not the best quality.  They are rather thin.

UPDATE 8/23/14: Recently received the Z-man version of the game as a gift.  While the tokens are much improved in this version, the grammar errors and rulebook readability are not.  I can't tell if Z-man had a proofreader look at the game, but if they did, the person did a poor job.

I love coop-games. Robinson Crusoe feels different. That the game somehow reacts to your actions by clever resolving of event cards is really neat. Also the text in italics tells a nice story. The decision to take risks or not is very difficult at some times. There are 6 scenarios which come with the base game but for sure this leaves a lot of content to develop for future expansions or fan made scenarios. The mechanics work smoothly and the game seems to be quiet challenging which isnt always granted in a coop-game.

There are multiple scenarios to keep the game fresh as well as being able to play solo or with your unlucky castaway friends.

Had high expectations for this one. I like playing it but I have to be in a very, VERY specific mood for it. It feels somewhat mechanical and boring sometimes.

RATING: 7
A solid coop.  Interesting-ish with the limited options and inherent tech tree and different scenarios, but really boils down to your usual worker placement coop.  Theme is excellent and well-reflected.  I misread one scenario as The Island of Cannabis (instead of Cannibals).  A great game but I'm not sure what, if anything, new it brings to the table.  Still, check it out - it works well and looks nice.

Robinson Crusoe is truly an amazing co-operative game and one of the best designs I've ever played of any board game genre! So far it's the only title that was actually able to marry a rich and interesting theme with really solid game mechanisms.

In fact I find most thematic co-operative games deeply disappointing, as they usually have an awful lot of reading cards and then a bunch of lazy design choices on the side. Take Arkham Horror as an example. I don't want to roll dice for 2-3 hours and have clunky mechanisms with lots of exception for no good reason. Theme is just not a good enough excuse for that. Robinson Crusoe instead has a clever worker placement system, it has resource management, it actually offers choices and tactics to explore. It's true, the game has a lot of small rules and exceptions for the sake of theme like Arkham does. Yet they all make sense also on the game-play side of things, because they actually offer a depth of choices. 

At the same time Robinson Crusoe is able to deliver an amazing story thanks to a wonderfully clever mechanism: something happens to you, you might have to make a choice and that choice might come to bite you later. This is how you develop a story in a board game. So many people rave - undeservedly, in my opinion - about the Crossroad system in Dead of Winter, which is basically made of Arkahm Horror style events that trigger for mostly arbitrary reasons. Instead, let me tell you... Robinson Crusoe is what the Crossroad system wishes to be when he grows up.

Also I would like to mention that, partly thanks to the strength of the theme, I was able to teach and play this game even with non-gamers and younger children... and they were all engaged in the experience! I'm really amazed by the genius of this design and how everything has a thematic but functional explanation.

So take all of this, put it in a great package with amazing artwork and cool wooden components, like the new edition does. Then add a tall deck of cards for constantly new stories, 7 scenarios for a huge amount of replayability and you have a must buy product! I really can't recommend this game enough. Robinson Crusoe is just a fantastic game and one that I can see myself playing a lot in the future.

RATING: 10
Pros:  Great theme, very challenging, adjustable difficulty.  Expandability.  Replayability.  This game beats Arkham Horror for me in the coop category for several reasons.  1.) less fiddliness.  2.) more randomish surprise elements...leading to more varied play experiences.  3.) the fight to survive feels more real, and the desire to play again to do better is there.

Cons:  Can be difficult to adjust the difficulty to where it is a challenge without being an impossibility.  Rules book is bad.  Do yourself a favor and download the many helpful pdfs on the geek that people have posted, this saves much time and aggravation.  All or nearly all of the rules information *is* in the book, but its not laid out logically leading to frustration.  

I have played this so far solo, and solo as 4 chars.  I find solo to be very hard, also I found solo as 4 chars very hard.  However, Solo as 4 chars + Friday & dog made the game challenging without the sense of impossibility.  I like this aspect.

I will be playing this with my nieces soon, and it will be good to keep Friday and the dog for that playthrough due to them (the girls) making sub-optimal choices due to lack of experience, and so I won't feel like I will have to alpha-game it just to survive.

This is a big point.  The alpha-gamer trait will rise in the alpha-gamer if he/she feels that they will lose without optimal choices.  If, however, there is a sufficient buffer of sub-optimal play choices, the alpha gamer trait will be rendered tolerable (this is my theory).

RATING: 5
Good quality components but some of the cards are badly translated and generally lacking in editing. Since this is supposed to be a game that tells a story, poor language really detracts from the experience and prevents you from really immersing yourself in the theme. 

Both setup and gameplay is too fiddly for me, with different tokens and counters and resources constantly being moved around.

The rules are not bad per se, but they could have been implemented better. Lots of questions arise in the details, and there is much potential for human error.

All things considered the game is mediocre. They should hire some author or something to edit and re-write the cards in english. A thematic game like this, if any, should have a lot of great flavor text.

A bit more creativity and a few more positive effects among the event-cards would make the game more fun. Also the wording on the effects should be more consistent.

Theme! An incredible co-op experience that puts you right into the shoes of the bedraggled survivors. Utilises Ignacy Trzewiczek's genius way of marrying theme to mechanics perfectly. Does require scouring the forums and faqs in order to navigate the messy rulebook however.

My only real complaint is that it seems a little too easy (playing with two plus Friday, or three plus Dog), especially since for some reason it is notorious for being difficult. Perhaps we were just lucky in that we just 'got it' from the get go. But after multiple plays we have only failed once, against the dreaded cannibals, and even then it was down to the wire.

Early positive impressions faded fast. 

The reality is the game is a bit too much the same from scenario-to-scenario. Good players will simply work out what needs to be done and only bad luck will stop them from doing it. The events have a lot of flavour, but they don't really change how you play, just make things easier or harder. 

Still, serious gamers might not be it's core audience. If they are, it's a noble failure - if not, it's a disposable frolic.

Sigh.  I like the theme and some of the system, but worker placement is dull even co-op.  I'd play Yggdrasil any day.  Less work, more fun, and possibly more "interest" -- RC has enough randomness that planning can fail badly without much casual chain to make you feel ok.

Excellent game, but my rating is solely based on my solitaire games, therefore it might change.

Makes you think on the spot and feels like an experience when left with limited choices on what to do. I love atmospheric games where I can immerse myself into. I could do with a longer play time but I assume most people love the 1 1/2 to 2 hour game of a scenario.

Very nice co-op game. I like the fact that you decide your actions as a group and not as individuals, that makes it easier to feel that you are working together and also makes it less likely to be played by a single player telling the others what to do. Everyone can ship in with ideas, based on the open information. I also like the event-deck mechanic á la Pandemic and Forbidden Island, it fits together very well.

Love exploring, gathering and building things! Love the co-op part. Love how you can thematically explain everything (maybe, almost?). Love the look of the game and the fact that I can choose female player (although, their look is not so good).

Hate all the small things that take a lot of space. Hate difficulty x(

It's a co-op... It may be a very good co-op but everyone is playing together and it could just as well just be one person playing.

Nice mechanics and stories but still just a co-op.

And a co-op isn't all that interesting. May be very good for being one though :)

3인 추천 [1-4] 1-3h

한글화가 되어서 6점. 아니면 5점 주겠음.
토큰이 너무 많고, 요즘게임답지 않게 보드판에 전부 놓을 수 없어서 난잡함. (도미넌트 스파시스와 달리 주요내용 전부가 보드판에 올라가지 않음.)

특히 시나리오가 중요한데, 보드판 외각 눈에 띄지 않는 곳에 놓아야 함.
아캄호러 보스와 달리, 항시 참조해야 하는데도.

캐릭터로 역할이 고정이고 생각과 달리 사냥이 건조함.
획득자원은 고정인데(사냥감 보상도 고정), 인원이 4명이되면 자원부족, 2명이면 행동력부족으로 3명이 가장 적절.

A very very deep and impressive game. The sheer amount of possibilities, the story the game is drawing new again and again is amazing. One of the games where you starve to death on an island and want to play again - thinking about what you want to change - looking forward to experience the outcome of your decisions. 

One of the few games that last for more than decades.

Amazing game design, amazing production, wonderful game.

I've played it twice, I think, and both times our group died before having seem to have even really done anything. I'm not sure if we were playing hard scenarios or got unlucky, or what, but it felt like a decent game engine, tuned to insane mode as the default. I'd think that this was a fluke or a rule played wrong, but I think I've heard people talking about how many times they had to play, just to succeed once.

Possibly best as a solo game. Anything else and you're screwed. Or, look for a variant that makes it easier.

RATING: 6
Wow. It is far from a perfect game, but this has a wealth of variability, and immersive magic. 

More in the near. 

*Edit: dropped from 9 to 6. Why? The rules are a mess. The system lost its engaging quality, and feels like a kludgy collection of ad hoc justifications. 

The immersive magic evaporated after playing through the possibility space more.

RATING: 6
It's a beautiful game with well integrated mechanics, especially in the adventure decks that get shuffled into events. I'm not certain it beats out other co-op games for me, but it's an uplifting alternative with easily tweaked difficulty settings. The game suffers from the illusion of choice; if you don't have enough food then you obviously go harvest or hunt. If you haven't built a level 3 or 4 roof and you'll roll two weather dice, you obviously focus on that. If you don't have one of the two +1 production tokens you obviously go for that. The engine building is really mundane in that way by punishing any choice that isn't one of the one or two optimal moves (regardless of whether you succeed or not).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting thematic co-op!  I appreciate how bits and pieces of it work nicely to make a thematic experience, and I think the game as a whole is well-designed, but there are a bunch of little oddities - the fiddliness is pretty major, for one.  Also, the different types of beast attacks and limited hunting deck (and the death iguana!) are somewhat weird.  It's a good game, but I've found that the experience isn't as clean as, say, Eldritch Horror and the puzzle isn't as interesting as Ghost Stories.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A beautiful adventure game. Soloplay is very well made with Friday and a dog to help you. The island is harsh, weather is brutal and you have to build, fight and explore your way through the scenarios. The scenarios reach from building a big fire to get rescued, over a quest to exorcise the island from evil, face a volcano and even more. Fantastic stuff.

Robinson Crusoe introduced me into the golden age of board games. The cooperative adventure of survival is always a blast. Sitting around the table with 2 or 3 other friends, with everyone holding their breath at a die roll or card draw is just thrilling.

The game has a reputation of being overly complicated, so I would suggest watching a gameplay runthrough/overview first. After that, it will seem more straightforward. (I have not played the latest edition but I suspect they have greatly improved on this)

Not my kind of co-operative game. There is absolutely nothing to stop one player from "running" the whole game. The game itself seems extremely luck-driven based on the card effects, which not much in the way of meaningful choices. The narrative isn't strong enough to create an immersive feel that could counter-act the above (as Arkham Horror does). The characters seem boring and hard to identify with: it can be very hard to actually use any special abilities, so your characters are interchangeable, and indeed often it doesn't matter which player's action pawns go in a particular place. Almost seems like some of the worst aspects of thematic, co-op, and Euro games combined.

RATING: 7
Not a game for the pessimistic.  Pretty much every card draw is a bad thing.  You will lose the first couple of games you play and it takes a few games to get into the flow of the game.  The rules can be a bit clunky and the book is not the easiest to scan through to quickly find a rule but if you role-play it and make any rules decisions thematically, it's not too bad.

Mostly, it's a puzzle game, you need to work out what items are available to you and what is critical to succeed in the scenario.  The rest is damage limitation and deciding when to push your luck to take extra actions.

Overall an enjoyable game, hard but it does make you want to replay "if we do THIS next time, we might win"

RATING: 6.5
Interesting coop that mixes a bunch of Euro mechanics and Ameritrash variety in a way that doesn't quite work for me.  While it is an attractive game, I found elements of it problematic from a playability POV.  First, there is a lot of text to read on the cards, but the font is too small.  Much of it is in cursive which makes it even harder to read.  

Bottomline is that I don't really get the hoopla.  I might get a copy at some point if I can get it cheap, but at normal OLGS prices, never mind the going price given its current short supply, I will pass.

The game i prefer at the moment. 

An excellent survival and adventure game. It's a clever mix between Arkham Horror and Agricola. Bad things keep falling on your head, and you can succeed only with a good coordination and strategy. A lot of tough decisions, but a lot less fiddy than Arkham. The game is quite expensive, but offers already a lot of replayability. If you compare with the Arkham encounter decks containing only 7 cards, you'll play a lot more with RC without going through the decks.
All the scenarios offer a real different gameplays.

Zee Garcia said it best. "Suffering in a box."
It's still a good worker placement style game that draws you into this world of survival, despair and courage. And there is so much replayability. Chances are you're never going to play the game the same way twice. All those event cards to play. Six different adventures from Robinson Crusoe to Indiana Jones to Swiss Family Robinson to cannibal attacks. There are times when it does seem too punishing but that is the challenge don't you know.

Un poco lioso al principio ya que hay que tener en cuenta muchos conceptos distintos y todos son necesarios en cada ronda de juego. Esto suele resultar algo abrumador durante las primeras partidas y puede desanimar a algunos jugadores.

Cuando todos los jugadores conocen bien el juego la partida es mucho más dinámica y las conversaciones se centran más en la planificación que en discutir sobre las reglas o lo que puede o no puede hacerse. 

Como cooperativo hay que tener mucho cuidado con el "efecto líder". Con tantas cosas por hacer y tan pocas acciones por jugador es muy fácil que alguien "sugiera" a sus compañeros lo deben hacer en cada turno. Y eso no es divertido.

Como solitario requiere de bastante preparación para empezar a jugar pero una vez comienzas la partida no se hace pesado, repetitivo o aburrido. Funciona exactamente igual que el cooperativo pero sin tener que ponerte de acuerdo con nadie sobre cuales serán tus próximas acciones.

RATING: 8
I have only played the introduction scenario, solo, and I've had a great time so far.

I think the game balances quite well the necessity to explore, gather resources, build stuff, and defend against the elements, as any game with this theme should.

Of all coop games that I've played, this seems to be the toughest to beat. It certainly requires the whole group thinking together to figure out the puzzle that each scenario will pose. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I like games dripping in theme. This is probably the most thematic of all of my games. The game is brutal and really makes you feel like you've been stranded on this island and your chances of survival are grim. Tough choices have to be made where you're picking not necessarily what is best for you...but what is the least likely to kill you.

Purchased new from sale of Warhammer Army.  

I really like playing this one.  I have messed up the rules several times in teaching games and playthroughs.  Because it has mostly been new groups each time, I have mostly played the first scenario.  I have only once played one of the other scenarios.  I was a bit surprised in that playthrough about how much the threat to the players changed.  It was not so much that the game was more difficult, but that the threat was different.  

Once you get your mind around the rules, it is not too difficult to teach this game working through the steps of a turn.  The player aids are also great for this.  Recommend picking those up from the files section here on BGG.

I was ready to really love this game, but it was so dang hard that I found myself feeling bad when playing it. I've never been so beat down and defeated by a game while playing it for so long. The thing I love out disaster style co-ops (Pandemic, Flash Point, etc.) is that it seems dire, but there are moments of hope. It may be false hope and the house may crumble around you a turn later from that hotspot, or the big outbreak, but at least you had a chance. Robinson Crusoe I almost never feel like I have a chance. I really hope that with more plays we are able to unravel the mystery of how to not completely suck at this game. I do have a lot of fun with it and the theme is spot-on throughout (especially when the event cards come back to haunt you) but we've only tried the 1st scenario and its supposed to be the easiest! I enjoy a tough game and I don't think that it would be any fun to have an auto-win, but a feel bright spots during the game would be great. I hope that a future expansion would add some tools that make it a little smoother. Still highly recommended and I'd ask to play it again. Solid game and theme, just be warned that it is crazy tough.

Another cooperative game, it doesn't give you anything new other than a higher difficulty than usual.

No feeling whatsoever when playing, and boring after some turns. (Why you should be injured when building a diary???) 
Some mechanics are just thrown there... 

Would be a 4, but the rules are so bad that I have to give it a 3.

An excellent cooperative game drenched in theme that is incorporated nicely into gameplay. I absolutely love that choices you make early in the game that give you short-term benefits can come back to haunt you later. Those cards really bring you into this world, make you feel engaged, and add so much flavor to the story.

Jeu coop dans l'univers de robinson crusoé, le jeu est assez complexe avec pas mal de règles et les parties sont assez longues ce qui ne facilite pas les choses mais le jeu est sinon très agréable avec des mécaniques originales et un système de scénario. Bref quand on a le temps de s'y pencher il est top mais il faut prévoir la soirée/ l'après midi.

Amazing, complex, highly thematic - never felt the struggle for survival so alive! (oh, no, it's a double snow cloud, now I will freeze and then starve to death...)

What makes this game truly amazing is its replayability and variability. First of all, playing the same scenario twice is never the same due to all the random events, items, etc. Second and most importantly, there are tons of different scenarios, each providing a completely different gameplay. And it's not only the "official" scenarios, but all the fan-based scenarios as well, some true gems among them!

12/26/14:  I wish that the designer had cared enough about the game to put more time into the rulebook.  Right now I'm frustrated with vague rules.  The rulebook should have been several pages longer  For example, only in the errata is it mentioned that your weapons level can go above what is shown on the charts.  Nowhere in the instructions does it talk about the map and the fact that incomplete tile areas though drawn in, are not playable.  The discovery tokens are not explained at all, you need to puzzle out what they mean or check the FAQ.  The green, gray, and brown cards are muted and very similar in color.  This mostly matters when you're checking the symbols on the encounter cards.  With respect to the colors, I do have to say that I prefer them to bright fluorescence that some american games have.

Rating may go up with more plays.

Once you get past the rules, you have an engaging game that has a lot of repeatability.

So, this is a pure co-op. That means it automatically loses points in my book. There's no intrigue. That said, I don't necessarily hate it.

My thoughts are - for a co-op to be good, you need to rely on other player's decisions, and not be able to make those decisions by committee. Robinson Crusoe MAY be complex enough to take care of this, but I still feel like a particularly informed player could go about correcting everyone's moves.

Again, I don't hate it (as much as Mike probably thinks I do - Just really wasn't in the mood for a co-op) but there's a bit too much randomness, and not enough strategy to really scratch the itch for me. Hell, I'll give it a couple more plays even.

I really like the combination of Agricola-style worker placement and tech-tree optimization combined into a thrilling and evocative co-op.  I'm really interested to see how the Voyage of the Beagle expansion turns out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A bit like a co-op version of Agricola.  You have all the pressure of trying to survive in harsh conditions but instead of trying to out-efficient the other layers you work together to solve the puzzles.

the game is very evocative of the theme.  I especially like the primitive tech tree that is available to the players.  

the downside is that unlike most co-op games, the different roles don't seem to play all that differently from one another.  The players don't really have much of an identity.

In addition this game does nothing to solve the common problem of "alpha players" in games where you all work together.  

These two weakness combine to create an experience that feels more like a very complicated jigsaw puzzle rather than a game.

That said, I think this is worth your time if you want to graduate from Pandemic into a slightly meatier or more thematic co-op game.

The rules are not that well written. Lots and lots of card effects and interactions that are not covered by the rules.

Plays from 1 to 4 players.

RATING: 8
Immense replayability, but the amount of chance involved given the devastating nature of some of the threat cards and the fact that the rules cover only a fraction of possible scenarios (thus the need for the creator(s) to publish a substantial FAQ) can make the game a laborious affair.

A játék nagyon jó! De azért nem BSG... Kiskoromban ez volt az egyik kedvenc regényem, legalább 3-4-szer olvastam. Ehhez képest kicsit csalódás, hogy nem konkrétan Robinsonról szól a játék, hanem általában a robinsonokról, de még így is nagyon jó a hangulata!!! Aprólékosan kidolgozott, szép, tele jó ötlettel, jól is működik, kihívást is jelent, és nagynak érzem az újrajátszhatóságot is (küldetések, rengeteg kártya...). Elég sok apróságra figyelni kell, sok a választható akció, de pont ez a játék nagy erénye, hogy elég nagy szabadságot ad, minden játékban  egy teljesen más történet rajzolódhat ki. Akiket érdekel a téma, vagy csak szeretik a kooperativakat, azok feltétlenül próbálják ki. Amit még kiemelnék: szuper az ikonrendszer! Egyedül az építésnél jelezhetnék, hogy mire vonatkozik az akció.
---
Húha! Nem emlékeztem, hogy ez ennyire jó! Javítok a pontszámon! 2 év eltelt, újra elővettük, ezúttal az volt a nagy különbség, hogy alaposan felkészültem a szabályból, jobban átláttam a játékot. Nagyon jó volt a hangulat, részben a társaságnak részben a játéknak köszönhetően. Szuper!! Megyek is kiegeket rendelni:)
---
Zseniális ez a játék. Nem gondoltam, hogy egy-egy küldetés ennyire más tud lenni. Az adott keretből teljesen mást hoz ki 1-1 sztori. Nagyon tetszik a játékrendszer, és a hangulat, szuper! Tovább javítok a ponton, kedvenc kategóriába kerül a játék!
---
Valamiért a 6. küldetés volt a legkönnyebb nekünk, pedig papíron az a legnehezebb. Lehet hogy csak szerencsénk volt, mert néhány jó lap jött az elején, de végig maxon volt mindenkinek az élete, éhezés se volt sosem... Némelyik más küldetésben alig marad életünk a végére, sőt a kannibálos akár 3-4 kör alatt mindenkit le tud nullázni.
---
Az első nagy kieggel még szuperebb, de az elpakolás már kezd macera lenni, nem is nagyon vesszük elő 1 partiért, szinte mindig kettőt játszunk egyszerre.
---
Na végigpróbáltunk minden küldetést, ami 2014 őszéig hivatalosan megjelent. Tényleg csak próbáltuk, mert a 13-ból 11-et csak egyszer játszottunk. Minden létező könnyítést igénybe vettünk, e nélkül némelyik pálya szerintem 20-adjára se sikerülne, ha így vesszük, több száz parti is benne lehet a teljes eddigi Robinson univerzumban.

Egyedül és ketten elég nehéznek érzem, talán hárman a legkönnyebb?!

RATING: 6.3
A game that thematically is very appealing though imo falls a bit short of what it could possibly be. The main board tries to stay thematic and succeeds up to a point, but it becomes less functional and intuitive as a result of the effort. The rulebook could be way better structured and explained to make more sense and avoid the frequent back and forth during the first 4-5 plays as well as the refuge to online faqs and errata in order to find the rule about several stuff that can be misinterpreted and/or misplayed.Overall, rather hard game to beat, mainly because of the luck elements in the game(random card pick for the seeding of the decks, card draw as well as dice rolls) which makes it a great challenge. Trying to beat it at least gives you a certain satisfactory after a few trial and error situations, which makes this game still stay in my collection for now.

I recall the designer stating on his blog that Robinson Crusoe solves the alpha player problem of cooperative games. I found this is not true at all: every turn players discuss and play at once, and this is very likely to end in one player find the best way of play and drive the others.

Apart for this quibble, I found Robinson a pleasant experience: it is random and not too deep in choices it offers (often the only choice is among playing it safe placing two counters on an action, or trying to do something more but rolling dice), but the thematic drive offers a satisfactory and funny couple of hours.

The production value is good if not stellar, with the notable exception of the rulebook. Portal has a name for good, quirky games with terrible rules writing, and Robinson is no exception.

Anyway, the game is definitely worth a try, and since my girlfriend loves it, it will see the table often...

Initial Impression: The word that immediately comes to mind is "brutal". Underneath the beautiful components of this game is a system that is designed to kick you in the teeth. Repeatedly. Thematically apt goals such as acquiring food, shelter, and basic tools, and hampered by the elements, wild beasts, and random events. Mechanically, it all makes sense and is fairly intuitive after an initial play-through. The AI providing the obstacles is generally very visible and you are aware of the punishment you're about to face. The problem is that it feels, at least initally, like there's very little you can do to prevent that punishment from occurring.

10 Plays: After having bought the latest edition of the game, I can't get enough of it. Every session provides a different experience with new stories to tell. I can now teach this game in about 10 minutes and everyone I've taught it to has enjoyed it. One would think that with only 7 official scenarios the game would become stale quickly. Not so. Most of my plays have been with the 1st scenario and I crave to play it some more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is the most accessible theme for casual players and the game is the #1 best co-op I own. Even though the game is longer, the theme is very apparent and rich in the gameplay. The events are not as random as other games because of the time aspect of the crises and makes for a well-connected thematic story. 

It's not as fiddly as AH, and a lot easier for people to pick up than Space Cadets.

An excellent game! Full of adventures but still you have to think a lot while choosing your actions in order to win.

My son (11 years old) learned to play very quickly and adores the game.
It is a game you can play alone and it is a great fun too! Additionaly you can make up your own scenarios and share with friends.

Immersive theme and excellent game design. However, both learning & teaching this game can be a chore. This game is easily one of the hardest games I've played. 
If you like difficult games & can handle the inevitable losses and deaths you will suffer then this game may be for you! However even though the game is very hard it doesn't make you feel like you have no hope, you still feel in it even in the games you may eventually lose. 
Rich theme, solid mechanics (euro-worker placement, exploration, dice rolling & card play), very well designed. Instructions are a chore they are well written enough but could be structured much better.

I really like the unique theme, and it feels relatively collaborative, but it's not the easiest game to just break out and play.  Setup takes a while, the rules are unclear in places, there are apparently disagreements about which set of rules to use, and the different components are unclear (e.g., white wooden cubes are fur (?), but there are also white plastic cubes).  Additionally, I often feel like I'm going to make the best move I can regardless of the rest of the team...not like we're all trying to knit together into something more impressive, but just doing our own things.

FAVORITE HEAVY WEIGHT COOPERATIVE GAME

1-4 Players / 90-180 Min / Weight: 3.69
Type: Thematic / Co-op / Solo

(Rated and commented after 4 solo plays in two days)

I've tried this only as a solo game so far. 3 times with 1 roles and once with 2 roles. I haven't cleared the first scenario yet even with the easy mode (2 roles + Friday + Dog), but it was close.
It is a very challenging game, but still make me keep playing, which is really amazing.

The biggest complaint about this game is the rulebook is not written very clearly. There are many ambiguous details so I needed to search for the rule forum or FAQ pages for them.

This is very different from Dungeon Petz, which has the similar complexity (weight of RC is 3.6 and weight of Dungeon Petz is 3.5). I recently got Dungeon Petz and found the rulebook was very well written and even very entertaining, so it was much easier to learn from the rule book that Robinson Crusoe.

My first (and for a long time only) game rated 10.

This game is a blast. It is freakin' hard but fair all the time. All events and dangers delivered ooze with theme and make you feel like being the unfortunate person stranded on this deadly island.

With various player roles, 6 different(!) scenarios and a ton of event cards you get a massive amount of replay value.

Only draw back are the rules. This game offers a variety of different systems working together to make your life hard and therefor the rules are quite heavy.
Even over 30 plays it still occurs to me that I may have missed something during play (not very often though).

Gorgeous game, well thought out and excellent thematic. It's just not the game for the wife and me, nor our gaming group. The game is constantly beating you back, maybe we were playing wrong, I know we did not give it enough of a chance, but 1 step forwards, 3 steps back every round is not fun in our book.

This is as near a perfect Co-op game as you can get. The only reason for not rating it a 10 is due to the unrelenting tempo of the game. Even in real life, unrelenting tempo takes a break once in a while, with a lull to catch one's breath. 
With RC, the tempo never lets the players take a step back to enjoy their progress (or lament over the lack of), and "take-in" the game. It's a fire hose pointed at you for the entire session. So the 9.5 is for the near-perfect design. But it loses a half point for not being as fun as it otherwise might have been, for the tempo.

The theme and cooperative style is perfect. We watch a lot of Survivor and Naked & Afraid type shows, so this is great for my family. The randomness of card draws and dice rolling tends to annoy me. However, the components and presentation of the newest edition causes me to give this game the benefit of the doubt. The challenges are difficult given the time you have to complete, but it makes for a great experience. This is a great combination of theme, some randomness and worker placement.

RATING: 7
A highly thematic, well-produced cooperative game that is not easy to win.
+ Different scenarios add replayability and variety
+ Lots of ways to use your workers giving you lots of choices to make each round
+ Character powers let each player offer something unique to them
- [b]So much luck.[/b] Cooperatives often rely on luck to balance the game but RC takes it to the next level. 
- Very susceptible to the "alpha" player problem that many coops have.
- Long play time. Outstays its welcome?

The high luck factor combined with the 90-120 minute play time will keep this game in "good, not great" territory for me. I think Pandemic does a better job balancing the luck-to-length factor and so I would play that game more often. The theme I really enjoy and I've only played the first scenario but would be interested in playing others to see if they change the game in interesting ways. The long play time and somewhat fiddly setup will prevent this game from getting to the table too often but that's alright with me. I honestly have no idea why this game is a Top 25 BGG game. Then again I like Dead of Winter even less and it's about the same ranking. I guess people really like well-produced, scenario-based coops?

This is a solid game. There are a loot of smal details to this game so you need to play it a couple of times to fully grasp/understand it. But when i play the game with new players i feel like the teacher and have to do all the upkeep and I get no reward of winning. But playing with people with equal experience and with 4 players its quite fast and fun, could be little bit to easy based on the scenario and amount of luck you get.

I played only the first scenario and I had the feeling that it was too easy at first and then in the end it was only about surviving all that the game threw at us. It didn't feel good, it didn't feel like I achieved something, I just barely survived until the winning condition was fulfilled.
Maybe with more games and when you know what to expect and how to prepare the best for it, then it might be better...

Pros
Another promising cooperative
Really nice components
Like the concept of the game responding to the actions chosen

Cons
Not convinced about the idea that this tackles the leader issue
There are lots of options which has the added disadvantage of extra rules for players to remember and although there will be many ways of the group winning I worry that a dominate player (probably me) would siggest some things that would clearly work
Sounds far too advanced with the level of rules for all the different possible situations
Poorly edited text
Lots of luck

RATING: 8
The first four plays of this game were lukewarm for me.  I felt the rules really were convoluted and confusing, which did impact the first few plays.  I stuck with the game, however, as the game seemed to be one I should really like.  After my fifth play, the game started to gel.  The different phases of the game started to make sense, and I began to love the extremely rich theme that is integrated into every aspect of the game. 
 
Now, I love the game and I always want to play it.  I feel it is, hands down, the deepest and most strategic cooperative game I own.  Also, every time I play it, I am impressed by how the mechanics themselves tell a story.  Because of this, the game created wonderful experiences for the players playing it.  It is one of my favorite games right now.  I am glad that I stuck with it.

This game was the most fun I've ever had while starving.
a co-op game was pretty refreshing since we've been at each others throats due to seafall. if you take my artifacts, i will punch you in the face will. If you ever sat on your living room sofa and wondered how you and your buddies would do on a deserted island, this game would probably give you an accurate picture. Apparently you can get seriously crippled trying to make a brick. Only through teamwork can you scrounge up enough bananas and sushi to survive. 
Will says most people don't win at this game. well we won on our first try. with minimal rules fudging. we win all the time. we won so hard.  
would not recommend to small children, unless they are winners.

I wanted to like this game so much but ended up loathing it. I felt so stressed and desperate fumbling for food and shelter, only to die by the hands, or say claws of a vicious tiger or fangs of a snake. Helpless, hungry, cold, because it was actually snowing, and very very low on morale. 
All these elements are actually in this game! What kind of a person sucks all the joy of the fantasy of being stranded on a desert island!?! COME ON NOW this could have been a much nicer game, a brighter more filled with wonder and beauty as you discover uncharted territories, taste delicious fruits nobody has ever tried before, or just decided to hang out by the beach and whittle flutes. 

Come on now, if anybody wants to feel totally desperate and close to death in a co-op game they can play Arkham horror, and that game at least is filled with wonder and awe against the unimaginable horrors from the unknown vastness of existence. 

Robinson Crusoe sucks the joy of exploration. With the players only focusing on getting those damn cubes or building a cabin in a very very slow and boring way. Moving little pucks. Well I'm all out of pucks, you know.
I'm out!

I'll admit - the first couple games were pretty exciting. 

But in later plays this just felt like it only gave me the illusion of choices. Everything that NEEDED to be done to not die horribly was pretty clear, and it became even more obvious when I had played it multiplayer with there being more helpful things that could be done at once. And despite all the event cards and that fact that you'll only go through a small percentage at one somehow didn't feel all that impressive either - it all still felt same-ish. And having played through all the scenarios, only a couple felt interesting.

Sold quite a few months ago. Never looked back

RATING: 3
Despite being promoted as a thematic game, Robinson Crusoe isn’t thematic at all: in fact, as its theme wears out quickly, it clearly shows its true nature, that of a dry and extremely boring game revolving about the resource management only.

Actually when playing you couldn’t care less about your characters and their survival on the island, even more so since the game itself doesn’t even bother to try and tell a story: it’s only interested in the way its rules work and make it harder for you to collect the resources you need.

In the end it lasts too long, plays too complex and feels too cold to be even remotely fun.

Scenario 1 completed on 2nd try - 46 VP (Cook). Possibly lots of errors in play noted.
Scenario 1 completed 3rd try - 31 VP (Explorer)
Scenario 2 completed 1st try - 21 VP (Carpenter). Might have been luck on event card draws (less book icons) and exploring only 4 tiki statues. 
2nd attempt (Chef) conceded by round 9 with 4 crosses built but no chance to succeed in the final 2. 3rd attempt (Chef) failed at round 10 - 4 crosses but not enough wood for 5th. Total chef failed attempts = 6.
Scenario 2 completed 7th try - 31 VP (Cook) round 10. Explored exactly 5 tiles, only 2 tiki statues. Hatchet treasure overpowered wood requirements. Only 1 fog area remain.

Scenario 3 - ended in failure on the 5th round due to 3 consecutive Event cards in a row and "Cataclysm" on the 4th draw. Due to that, we had not enough wood to build the raft and in turn be unable to save Jenny while she falls in hunger and cold on the island.

Scenario 4 completed for 2 players - looked most certainly like a loss until final round 8 when the event "Natural Dam Breaks" gave us our most lucky break of the year! A +1 wood needed to top up our wood supply to 3 so that we can finish off the Jolly boat to get us off the island! Absolute craziness and epic finish!

A really detailed and meticulous cooperative experience. Folks are trying to accomplish a fairly simple task, but the Island is thwarting them at every turn, forcing everyone to engage in the simple act of just staying alive. 

I don't own the game and have only played once. It may not be as difficult as the rules and play-aids make out, but the symbols are not intuitive and are annoying small. This makes it difficult to remember what effects do or even to know they are from across the table.

The topic and theme are attractive, however, so I'm sure I'll be giving this one second and third tries after learning the rules.

But its a lot of fun losing, this game is a keeper and its fantastic solo.

Oh my... Do you really think this game deserves the 14th place in the ranking, guys? Seriously? I can't believe it. It was a huge disappointment. It is not even a game, to me. Just a bunch of mechanics put together. The theme is nice but the mechanics and the scenarios seemed to be... "forced" to fit into it. There's a huge number of badly explained rules that make the game turn slow, and it is a pain to learn to play. 
My hint: avoid it. It doesn't worth the expense.

The praise is deserved. Others have said it much better than I so can just affirm. What makes it such an immersive, narrative experience is that every mechanic makes so much sense. The decision points occur at the most cleverly appropriate moments and give one the tension that they should have. Luck is there (something that concerned me) but not to the degree that it makes one feel as though one's decisions don't matter. Rather, they round off the edges of the decisions, making them calculated gambles. This is important because the specific gambles one takes becomes a matter of intense discussion, which helps mitigate the alpha player syndrome. It all just...works. This seems to me the most creative co-op game I've ever played.

What a great game!

So engaging, so intense! Breathtaking!

This is a survival game... and you'll struggle every minute of the game. You need food, but you need a shelter, then you need to upgrade your tools/tech tree. You need to explore in order to do all the other things... then you feel you are running out of time... and then you split your actions so you can do more things... and then things fall apart! You can't do both things well, some get done, and some don't.... and then there's all the events (wild animal, bad weather, psychological reactions...etc) ufff...

It's crazy madness! Things get worse each turn! And when you get that feeling of accomplishment, the very next turn you get caught in troubles again. 


It's simple to play, but so hard to master! You'll be like you can't control a single bit in this game... but it's such a great experience. You'll lose way more than you'll win... but when you win, it's such a great feeling!

One of the best games I've ever played. Certainly, the best co-op I've experienced.

- You'd better make notes because when You will come back to this game in the future You gonna need them! ;) 

- strong theme, very beautiful board game
- it is a cooperative game (no rivalry)
- players fighting against scenarios, it is easy to lose in this game
- to play this game smoothly one player should know the rules to avoid annoying breaks 
- playing time (120-180 minutes)

Still, if complexity of the game is not a problem You should give a shot.

WARNING: IT IS SUPER HARD TO COME BACK TO THIS GAME AFTER THE  BREAK. IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE RULES.

RATING: 8.25
Rules can be explained on the fly, but are still lengthy. Most scenarios allow different approaches, which makes the Coop experience very relaxed, but this isn't generally true.

On the bad side some scenarios require a certain approach and then just luck with dice rolls and card draw. It does offer decisions while on the way, but due to the nature of this game those decisions cannot actually be rational, because there's too much ambiguity, what you might need in the future.

I would love to play a streamlined version of this game.  As it is now it is a bit too complex.  I have to reread the rulebook every time I play, which I'd rather spend playing the game.  It requires a bit too much setup and rule book checking to remain in my collection.

Provisional rating (suspect it will go down if I play it again). 

Horrendous rulebook, we took a while to get setup and play (and needed a restart when it was obvious we'd screwed up).

Buzz is it is a co-op that works ... it doesn't, really you're just a single player with multiple actions than distinct players with your own actions. Can easily suffer with one alpha player dictating everything as there is zero player specific hidden information. Perfect as a solo game, not so great as a co-op.

If you like solve the puzzle from the bits you've got then you'll likely love it. Me, plenty of other stuff I'd much rather play.

Despite the fiddliness with the rules and the rulebook, and the lack of art, and the generally bland board, the game is suprisingly fantastic.  I love the item-crafting and the test-your-luck decision making.

RATING: 7.8
Very very pretty game.

Interesting and fitting theme.  I enjoyed the designer's videos and some of his concepts related to this game before I even played it.

I really enjoyed my first play of this game.  It is however for me very complex in some ways so for me, I don't think it flowed as nicely maybe as it could have.

Intelligently done co-op game that has a very gritty feeling.  There are 6 phases to every round and the weather phase can be brutal.  This game will not be for everyone.  It would work well for people that like an occasional solo game and for groups that enjoy social gaming. (talk and play)

I think a sound track with waves n seagulls would go very nicely with this game and of course storms for the weather phase. :)

There is a quick start file that was crucial to read I think before playing for the first time.

Will you and your party survive?

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT COMICSTYLES GUIDE... :)

I found this to be a very compelling game full of lots of cool ideas.  I want to play this game again and I plan to buy the Z-Man edition.  My gripe has to do with that rulebook in the first edition and the iconography.  Horrible.

*edit*  After several more plays I'm upping my rating.  RC is just full of cool ideas and delivers non-stop tension.  An excellent co-op.

At first I didn't understand this game. There were too many moving parts and the game felt random and punishing. But after a couple of plays I began to understand that this game is all about risk management. Your actions have consequences for the future, the more you explore and disturb the island the more danger you expose yourself to, even though you must in order to get food and shelter. The survival theme comes through really strongly here.

Got a number of plays under my belt.   A few solo missions, and a handful of group games, with various scenarios.   This a one of my favorite games.

  Love the difficulty of the game.   The theme is really strong.   It might not seem like it through the first round or two, but once you start to realize how much is going on, how many thing are going wrong around you, how many things you actually need to accomplish...your will start to feel like you are stranded.

One con, or the closest thing I can come up with for a con, is that there is a lot to learn to play the game.  Many cards are two sided and during initial setup, it can be difficult to understand what is going on.   But once you get through a game or two, you will have the hang of it.

It drips, from all sides, with theme.   The characters special abilities make them feel like the characters they are.   And the teamwork aspect is very strong.

Fantastic Game.

The co-ops I like tend to be thematic and tell a story.  Otherwise they tend to feel too puzzle-y and pointless to me- just playing to beat the game.  The theme works very well and the elements of the game almost always make sense with the the theme.  It feels like you are shipwrecked and struggling for survival.  The game is complex but flows quite nicely, the worker placement mechanic is great in this, and game actually feels kind of elegant after a couple plays.  Having the different scenarios is great and there is a ton of replay value.

One 3-player game, Intro scenario.  It's a good coop but has the same "one player to rule them all" problem as every other coop.  Also, there were a ton of decks of cards and bits... lots of replayability and hard to master the game, but still felt like just another run of the mill coop.

My rating is based on solo play. This game is fun, interesting, and challenging. The rules are a little convoluted, sometimes leaving a sense that something might have been missed during a game. The theme and presentation are excellent. Each character gets two actions per turn, and players have to decide which actions to take for the good of the community. I think this system is better suited for solo play, which gives the sole player full control to pursue whichever actions/strategies he/she think best.

Es un juego colaborativo en el que se ofrecen hasta seis escenarios distintos que suceden en una isla en la que los jugadores han naufragados. Sólo he jugado de momento el primer escenario.

Es un juego bastante dificil de ganar, pero asegura una buena experiencia. Es muy cinematográfico. En el primer escenario, tuvimos que cazar, explorar la isla, contruir el campamento, protegernos del frío y demás.. y además construir una pila de madera para hacer señales a un hipotético barco.

Despues de echar un vistazo a los escenarios, el juego no hace sino ganar puntos. Cada escenario ofrece alternativas diferentes que le dan un sabor especial al juego. Muy recomendable. Toda una experiencia.

RATING: 8
Enjoyed this one quite a bit. Have only played it in groups of 2 or 3, but I think it would also work very well solo. The game does theme tremendously well--pretty much every gameplay mechanic makes real-world sense.  The six scenarios give quite a lot of replayability, especially since the last one (Robinson Family) will have different objectives and require a different strategy every time. 

Compared to some other co-op games (e.g. Eldritch Horror), the options for scaling the difficulty of a given scenario are not very robust. But the scenarios themselves do range from very easy (Castaways) to very challenging (Cannibal Island, Robinson Family.)

Setup is one downside. There are lots of decks and components, so give over 15 minutes or so to that. My other complaint is that the rules are sometimes unnecessarily complicated. The game could have accomplished much the same thing while being streamlined considerably. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Punishing yet fun co-operative game. Sometimes in games like this I feel like the limited choices really don't leave you with many meaningful decisions, but somehow in Robinson Crusoe I didn't. Although you aren't planning out chain-reaction moves that leverage adjacent tiles, or other typical Euro game moves, there is a good deal of thinking on where to spend your limited action points. The theme was great and it sounds like there are a lot of fun scenarios. Would definitely like to play again.

First play and we lost on Round 6 or 7. Joe died.

Update: Have now played 4 times. Bumping to an 8.

Same analytical feel, but weaker than Mage Knight in almost every way.  Notably, less control, as ultimately the game drives the player and not the other way around.  Wild swings of luck demolish planning and utterly reduce the chances of successfully carrying out a tactic.  No semblance of nuanced strategy.

This is a really well designed game.  It's addicting.  So much going on.  Yes, their is a fair amount of luck with dice rolls and card flips, but as with many games, its all about luck management.  I really feel like I'm on the island struggling to survive.  Plays great solo.  Only reason it is not a 10 is because the rulebook is horrible--a perfect example of how NOT to write a rulebook.  You can't find anything quickly, no index, poor headings, and constant "important" headings which are meaningless and don't help you find the important info you are looking for.  It does take time to learn, but once you do, it is absolutely worth it.

I went into this feeling very optimistic and excited but the experience felt a bit arbitrary. I never really felt I was trying to survive on an island and have fun in a thematic way. Most of the time was spent looking at numbers, drawing cards, trying to work out permutations and calculations. As mentioned in other comments I felt that the game plays you rather than you playing the game, without any meaningful decisions to make. Interaction can be limited to the one leader just deciding what to do for everyone. So kinda just trundle along in a bland sort of way. Was expecting a richer experience with more player power and choices that actually can make a difference.

This is probably a better game then my rating gives it credit for, but I hate games that are brutally hard and this game (and Ghost Stories) are the poster children for the brutally hard solo/coop game. Though it is thematic for being lost on a "cursed" island, it is a poor thematic match for Robinson Crusoe who didn't have it nearly this hard. If he had the book would have had 1 chapter! Not my kind of game but many people like it.

So many interesting things going on in this game. The idea of having secondary penalties when problems aren't addressed is really smart, and the incorporation of delayed effects back into the event deck is a brilliant and unique mechanic. The game is also carefully calibrated so that you always seem to lose something every turn, and you can never quite do everything you want. Often you need to spend resources to work towards your long-term goals, but need the resources right away to save you from an immediate weather or event effect. Spending two actions on a task can remove the risk of failure, but the sacrifice is often too great to be worth it. The game is brutal, no doubt, but it is also an interesting challenge, and gives you so many ways to win (and lose).

My problems with the game are minor, but may be a huge turn-off for other players. The dice rolling can be frustrating, and often your life or death comes down to the roll of a single die (on the other hand, you can avoid rolling dice by spending more actions, but it's almost as punishing to do so). You also have to basically be ready to be hosed again and again, relentlessly, for the entire course of the game. It's a totally unforgiving experience: only bad things happen to you, and few cards provide any good news. Not for the faint of heart.

My joke about Robinson Crusoe is that it's what Arkham Horror would be, if Arkham Horror were any good. Some crazy swingy luck (some of the events are nasty), and over-chromed, but flavorful and nice risk management and resource allocation choices. The extra scenarios - riffing on/ripping off a wide variety of island-survival-literature - are a nice touch too.

Even after a couple games I'm still not totally sure what to make of it, whether it's OK, good, or great (the most likely answer is good). It's over-chromed and a touch over-long, and the swingy events aren't quite so welcome in a game of this length and complexity. Traditional Portal very bad rules and questionable iconography. Balanced against this is the fact that it's a cooperative game that pushes some boundaries and tries to deliver in a spot somewhere between the insanity and crazy but flavorful chaos of Tales of the Arabian Nights and the finely-honed and well-balanced Lord of the Rings.

A really challenging cooperative game, which also excels at providing a story. Many decisions you make in the game will come back, usually to haunt you, later, which is really neat, as the event deck "remembers" some experiences you've had.

It's a real challenge just trying to survive on the island, while also trying to fulfill the win conditions of the scenario. Things really can turn ugly!

A great cooperative game if you like a game that punishes you thoroughly, while giving you a chance to pull things out.

Not sure what all of the fuss is about. Looking at discussion of the game, it seems most people are playing this solo, which maybe explains its popularity (and popularity of co-ops in general?). Not much there for a multi-player game. The game seemed very basic and easy to me. 

That doesn't mean later scenarios won't be tough to win. I just mean that the decisions don't seem that complicated, and there isn't a lot of room for the players to discuss strategy without the alpha player problem rearing its head. Not that there is a ton to discuss anyway. Meh.

This game is different than many other co-ops. It almost feels like a ”normal” eurogame, which means that it takes quite a while to play and is quite complex. Also, the theme seems to integrate well with the game mechanisms.
There are several scenarios (I only got to try scenario 1 twice, a win and a loss) and different roles which means the replayability should be good, especially considering the lots of cards which will come out randomly each time! However, this doesn’t solve the “alpha male”/”captain”/”Mr. Know-it-all” player problem when one player tells the other what to do.
I love co-ops, but this isn’t my top choice. It was good enough and very different, so if you don’t like co-ops you might still like this one.

I've played this over 20 times now and I really am enjoying the adventure this game offers. Just a great overall game with lots of replay and vast amounts of scenarios available, Just gotta translate the awful rulebook. Anyway, Love the difficulty to win with many variables effecting the goal, including lots of random elements that can get a little frustrating. It's very thematic and engaging and gives a great sense of accomplishment with every victory, that is if you can win.

OMFG - this game gives you a serious beat down. You really need to persevere to succeed. It took us 8 tries before we finally conquered the first scenario in 2 player mode. But WOW was it satisfying to finally get that signal fire lit in th 11th turn! You really need to maximize every possible thing to thrive and survive. Patience is a virtue and good things DO come to those who wait... Eventually.  8)

Took some experimentation with finding the right group to play with. Most of my gamer friends did not enjoy the learning curve stage and this led to several utter loses. That said, once the proper group was assembled, we won the first scenario on the first try and it then felt too easy. As far as replayability goes, it seems more trouble than it's worth in training players and the other five scenarios did not interest us.

This game likes to kick you in the balls and spit on you while you're down, but it's also telling you a story while doing it.  The events getting shuffled into the deck to possibly pop out later is a really neat mechanism.  A very good co-op with a crazy press your luck action allocation system.

Such an awesome adventure on Aug 25, 2013 although it is hard.  It would reflect the truth that life is hard if we stayed in the Crusoe island.  I believe we can try 3 pawns for one player (assuming he is working in morning, afternoon and evening sessions).  Of course we also need the assistance with Friday and hunting dog.
One player gets 3 pawns.
Another player gets 2 pawns with Friday and the dog.

Alternatively, we can also add a character- Friday's wife instead of using the third pawn.  If one of the family members in Friday passes away, the remaining half will leave the team.

Finished the 1st scenario to build a pile of wood before the end of the last day on Oct 10, 2013.

Use the official setup, finish the 1st scenario on Jan 25, 2014.

12/30/2014 - Played my first non-solo game of this to completion and really liked the game.  The other players felt it was too hard.  I had made the game easier by adding the Dog from the start.  We did have a chance to win, but I think toward the end of the game one of the players was ready to end it for better or ill.  It ended for ill - but I think we just got too hasty toward the end.  Building the Hatchet early in Scenario 1 is a must, which we didn't do.

So apparantly it is almost impossible to get every rule right the first times you play this game. We won the first scenario at the first try and were like "that wasn't so hard!" Then we checked the rules and were like: "what, you can only gather wood OR food in the gathering phase?!" I also missed the rule that you have to use more workers for gathering resources and exploring tiles when the tile is not adjacent to your camp. Or that the book symbol triggers a bad event that is written on the scenario card. 

Of course, even if you know the myriads of rules, there is a  probability that you still get things wrong during the game, just because you are not focussed enough. You forget the weather phase, for example, or a token that says "time-consuming action". When you realize these small mistakes a few rounds later in the game, it feels like you cheated. 

Apart from that, this game is great. I really like the permanent sense of discovery and how unpredictable everything is. You cannot "solve" the game. It is not like a puzzle where you can rack your brain and come up with a masterplan. Every round confronts you with another problem and you have to leave some of them to chance as you neither have enough time nor enough resources. This is why the game feels so incredibly organic. You have to decide on the spot, trust your instincts, and be prepared to get screwed despite the best plan you could come up with. It is half an experience, half a game. It is an adventurebook, actually, but this one is much more driven by your own decisions and more atmospheric.

This is a great game, but it suffers from 1 thing. Rules! Maybe I haven't played it enough, but remembering the rules/gameplay is difficult on this one. I'm not talking about what all the little nuances on each and every card mean, but just simple gameplay. I have done around 3 plays of this game and still seem to forget something. For comparison sake Scythe has a decent amount of rules, I've played that about 3-4 times, and I remember the rules fairly easy. I would give it a 10, but it lives up to the "you have to play this about 10 times before you'll understand what to do" hype.

It's kind of funny how pretty much every event and adventure card in this game is trying to kill you, but on the upside you know you don't want to go on adventure and the dice are weighted towards specific results so it makes it predictable. Thus the different cards add variety without making the game random.

Update Feb 2016:
Did not hit the table often, due to the alpha syndrome and fiddliness in setup. There are much better coop games, and its upcoming Martian theme sibling will have the cards in an app, so sold this one.

---

One of the best solitaires/coop in existence. Don't go in expecting deep decisions, this is an optimization and dice chucking game. If you can avoid alpha gamers, you are in for a great ride. Must have.

+ very thematic, with great narrative
+ easy to play, once you get the hang of it
+ uncomplicated mechanisms that tie well together
+ tough but manageable, well balanced

= luck of the draw galore. Since it's a storytelling game I am ok with it
= although it has many scenarios, I am unsure whether I would play anyone again after I win it

- alpha player syndrome galore
- the rulebook has some gaps, but FAQs exist

Ricky Royal how to videos on YouTube were a must.  I made it through about 1/2 a round solo but due to time limits, gave up.

I enjoy the game but still feel lost despite the video tutorials.  I'll give it another go.  It is indeed fun, but I think it would be more fun as a group game than in solo play.  I'll update this later.

After several more attempts, I finally beat the first scenario.  The game is hard, kind of complicated, and not the typical "worker placement" type of game I normally like.  While it is still fun to play, I think I'd prefer to whip out Agricola, Stone Age, or Lords of Waterdeep over this one...and my kids don't care for this one at all...."too hard, I don't understand it".

After more plays, the game hasn't improved for me and has just been more frustrating.  I'm dropping it from 8 to 7 because it just lost all fun for me.  I ended up trading this game away and I don't regret it.

PROS - superb design for a themed co-op. the hype is true. very unforgiving. lots of dilemmas/sacrifices/choices to negotiate with friends. 

CON - absolutely horrendous rule book. whether it was poor translation or just poorly written/edited: unforgivable from Z-man. i'd probably give this a "10" as an all-time keeper if the instructions weren't so annoyingly poor. 80% is fine and then you'll get to a few parts where you're confused and there is nothing to elucidate it outside of coming here. your first time through will be generally over-played and Tom Vasel was correct in his video review in respect to the poor instructions.

"Robinson Crusoe" is the kind of game that makes you stand up and cheer when you successfully finish a scenario. Winning feels like an accomplishment, and there are few games that make it feel for meaningful. I give the game huge respect for that, and I definitely want to feel that thrill again.

However, "Robinson Crusoe" is also a game that leaves me so emotionally drained at its end that I don't want to approach it again anytime soon. Bad things are happening all throughout its long, long runtime, and it does get wearying after a while. The game also suffers from "Alpha Gamer Syndrome. I tend to think of it as "miserable Pandemic," not because the games play similarly but because in "Robinson Crusoe" - just like in "Pandemic" - you're often going to end up in a situation where one player is calling the shots and everyone else is just doing what they're told.

I really hope to play this game again, hopefully with a strong-willed group who can determine for themselves what actions they want to take. For now, this games resides in my respect Hall of Fame, even if I don't truly love it.

RATING: 8
Good
Quick and will get a lot quicker (prediction)
The variety of the scenarios show how well the game mechanics link to the given theme without a heavy additional rules burden.
Despite the euro style game mechanics this should appeal to the thematic crowd.

Not so good
I do not think this game solves the alpha player issue at all 
Rules are not the greatest (scenario 1s winning conditions not clear - we played it wrong)

A potential solution to the alpha player issue is to take leaf from RPG games.  Rather than planning our turn and considering the characters as assets (my approach and too much like pandemic) the best way is to run your characters seperately and negotiate co-operation when needed (more like the Pathfinder card game).  Who is going to collect some food (asking the other players) rather than just treating a character as two actions.

Having played the game solo I thing that the temptation is to treat the characters as assets, not a good idea (multi player), since it damages atmosphere and disempowers other players.  Play it like more like a thematic game rather than a euro despite the worker placement mechanics and puzzle like nature.

By being the person that knows the rules you can end solo playing the game and having the new players watch.  Next time I will have to keep reminding myself to role play the game and let the rules and win take care of themselves.

For me the weak link in this game is thematic rather than game play.  If a loved the theme more this would be a straight forward 10, it is the best co-operative game I own in game play terms. The Pathfinder card game and Eldritch Horror games thematically appeal more and that for now matters more.

I didn't find the rules too convoluted. I usually don't like co-ops as much because I tend to see through them to the core challenge which leaves only a few logical choices (see pandemic). Robinson Crusoe really escaped because of the thematic storytelling, which is weird because I really don't get hung up on theme. I guess even though I was just racing against the system and unexpected randomness, I felt immersed because of the story that was unfolding. 8 because as a pure game it's not perfect, but an 8 is a really big compliment from me considering my preferences.

Gorgeous components, theme to the nines, and loads of things going on that all interlock and play together perfectly all make this a must-try...for experienced gamers.

Moja pierwsza gra kooperacyjna i jestem nią zachwycona po dziś dzień. Kupiłam ją z myślą gry na 2 osoby i świetnie się do tego sprawdza. Można wybrać 2 poziomy trudności, więc nawet jeśli przejdziemy wszystkie scenariusze na łatwym poziomie, to warto zagrać na tym trudniejszym. Scenariusze dają duże pole do popisu i powinny spełnić oczekiwania nawet najbardziej wymagających graczy. Gra świetna zarówno dla graczy średnio zaawansowanych, jak i nałogowych geeków. Jakość elementów pierwsza klasa. Instrukcja bardzo długa i toporna, polecam przeczytać 2 razy, ciężko w niej znaleźć interesujący nas wątek, bo przewija się on zapewne jeszcze na 10 innych stronach instrukcji. Dobrze rozegrać na początek rozgrywkę solo i najlepiej ściągnąć FAQ do gry sporządzone przez fanów (dostępne na BGG w języku polskim), które rozjaśnia wątpliwości w konkretnych sytuacjach i na konkretnych przykładach, nie zaszkodzi również video recenzja. Pomimo tych przeszkód technicznych, zdecydowanie warto. Gra jest ogromnie klimatyczna, przygotowanie niestety zajmuje chwilę, ale później nie wiadomo kiedy czas ucieka i pomimo, że jest to kooperacja naprawdę czujemy się jak rozbitkowie na bezludnej wyspie, kiedy co chwilę spadają na nas jakieś katastrofy (więcej w tej grze bata niż marchewki), ale może właśnie to sprawia, że chcemy rewanżu i dalszych rozgrywek. Gra łoi i gnoi na każdym kroku, każdy kto ją zna, ten wie, że żeby wygrać trzeba albo źle grać (80% przypadków), albo mieć niesamowite szczęście. Uważam, że to must have.

In some ways, I feel that the intro scenario misrepresents the game. You'll finish castaways limping across the finish line, hemorraghing health and resources. It feels like survival, not a win. Subsequent games might be harder to win, but they feel more focussed and directed, in a way that's more intelligible. This game makes no attempt to resolve alpha player issues, but the easiest way to do that is to not play with Alpha players.

Juego cooperativo donde tomamos el papel de náufragos, y hay que sobrevivir y cumplir un objetivo según un escenario dado, y no es nada fácil conseguirlo. Muchas cartas y hay que leer sí, pero lo salva que si te metes en el tema no es problema. Lo malo es que, por la cantidad de trabajo y esfuerzo que te exige el juego, éste no te da un respiro y la diversión se ve afectada. Aun así, notable!

LD. Lots of text. Very thematic and pure cooperative gameplay. Leader syndrome present, best as solo? One of the most complex cooperative games. Russian version has pretty decent components. Wait for a streamlined edition (with oprganizer and cleaned up rules), currently it takes too long to setup and too cumbersome to teach and play. +++

RATING: 8.5
Heavier cooperative scenario based game with strong theme and atmosphere. Lots of game parts, lots of rules, but everything is so cleverly put together in one big immersive experience. This game could be very hard and challenging (depends on number of players - some scenarios are easy when playing solo using one character) and you will probably loose more often than not. But when you manage to beat the scenario, it will be very satisfactory. You will be struggling most of the time against odds, battling with bad weather, unlucky events and trying to avoid/lower the consequences of them, but also running out of time to finish the scenario goals. One bad event after another, you probably won't manage to survive, but hope is always there..

What I like:
- Theme is very well implemented. You really feel as you are survivor on the lost island. The tension is real and you are beaten from weather, wild animals, bad luck similarly as if you really were stuck on the wild. 
- There are number of scenarios available (plus additional created by fans) and each of them are different so you can choose whatever you want. Replayability is high there.
- Each decision is hard. You usually need to do more actions than you can at the moment, picking the priority ones can be challenging, but fun.

What I dislike:
- There are lot of rules to remember. This game takes long to master and it is pain to learn it from scratch. But once you got into it, it is so rewarding. Ideally you have somebody who can learn you how to play it (takes role of some kind of "gamemaster" to handle most of the rules). If unplayed for a long time, you probably should revisit some rules as they could be forgotten.
- The setup and tear down time is long. The game could be finished quite quickly (at least when playing solo with only one character), so preferably have several sessions in one game night. There are lot of components, tokens, cards and it takes some time to prepare everything.
- The game is very luck dependent - the events are picked randomly and they could be truly devastating for the moment or easy as a cake. They can be somehow mitigated but still sometimes you are victim of a several bad events and you cannot do anything about it. Also dice adds some random element as they could be devastating when rolling badly (mostly weather dice). This is great to the theme - sometimes everything seemed to be against you, you cannot control everything, but for true gamers who rely mostly on their skills this could be frustrating.

I like this game. Its a cooperative game where you are stranded on an island. The game sets up goals that you have to achieve. All the while you have to survive against the elements. It has a heavy theme. I even play tropical island sounds on the stereo while playing. Its very challenging. I've played twice and haven't yet won/survived.

This game is all about the story; I'd say it's more of a RPG with boardgame mechanisms. The game system presents a challenge, but it's not a particularly engaging one unless the players are interested in the flavour-text and the unfolding narrative of shipwrecked adventurers struggling to survive in an inhospitable wilderness. 

The 6 scenarios, and the massive variety of event and adventure cards, give the game huge replayability for those who are interested in the story. For those who are not, the game feels samey from the second play onwards.

Still learning how to play. But I've been watching videos to get a better handle on the game. And I must say that this game has me very excited! I think much of whether a game really incorporates thematic elements into the mechanics is subjective. And I must say that for me, this game really conveys the idea of survival on a deserted island. I absolutely love the theme and I think the game play actions and mechanics really mirror that theme quite well!

This score may go up once I play and get the rules down. And yes, there are a ton of little rules that need to be maintained. There are so many moving parts in this game and it seems overwhelming at first. But at least, unlike my COIN games, knowing what to do and when to do it seems a bit more intuitive, even though you might still suck at the game. 

I would say that once you learn the big picture on what to do and how to process it, the rules will mesh much better than a COIN game, which is incredibly complicated as to the big picture. 

I don't have that many games as I am just not drawn to many. But the ones that I have, have captivated my interest for the most part. And this one is no different.

Lovely, thematic, and interestingly challenging. More randomness than I tend to prefer in my games, but for the action dice, at least, it probably evens out over the long haul. (The weather dice, tile draws, and some sorts of card draws seem more swingy.) Could plausibly suffer from "not enough decision-space for the # of players" once one knows the game well, but at my current level of skill there were such a large number of plausibly-good choices every turn that it was an interesting discussion. Want to play again.

Una maravilla de juego! Tanto en cooperativo como en solitario. De primera, rejugabilidad muy alta por los diversos (8 y creciendo) escenarios, y la multitud de cartas de evento, que se encargan de que cada partida al mismo escenario sea completamente diferente. Temático 140%, te vas a meter de lleno en tu personaje, y sentirás sus éxitos y fracasos como propios. No tiene excesivo efecto lider, gracias a los dados (odiosos dados). Aunque los dados le dan ese odioso toque de azar, no es obligatorio usarlos, si te arriesgas es porque quieres y porque asumes el riesgo de fracaso.

I rated this an 8 and not a 9 only because I think this game is best with 1 or 2 players and my play group is usually 3 or 4 players so although I want to play it, I can't always suggest it.  The theme is integrated well, and the various scenarios give a different flavour to the game.  It is very nicely balanced as there is never a turn without tough choices to make.  It can play quite quick once you get a few plays under your belt and get the hang of the turn order flow.

While I do see the cool stuff in this game (Artwork, resurfacing events, differentiating scenarios, cool adventure cards) the rest just beat this game down for me. The Rulebook was way too fiddely, I got frustrated how much I had to look through all the pages to find stuff I needed for my playthrough. The events and dice make this game way too random for me. I do understand that it simulates trying to survive on a hostile island, but I always felt like I was at the absolute mercy of the dice, which i hate. Also, I, as a colorblind person, had real troubles identifying some symbols and telling them apart.
I played it twice solo, I will probably never play it again. Maybe with a full cast of four players.

This game is excelent. First match has been sloooooow, with too much rules consulting, but last turns (faster) show an impressive stressful game. Events are rich and prepares you for what is comming in some cases, so you can  react properly. A great mix of adventure and tactics plenty of theme.

New matches and more rules consulting. Events, determination and general dynamic are very good, but I feel a little constrained by scenarios and cards. I think that same mechanic should serve better to an adventure game, with more movement and variety. Too many (samey) storms for considering it a great experience.

Part of what makes this game great is the challenge.  A cooperative game that becomes a sure win becomes a sure bore...not going to happen here.  However, you do pick up on certain strategies after multiple plays that will always be needed to win any given scenario.

I really enjoy playing this game because I never feel like I'm just trying to gain points.  It's easy to turn the game into a story.  And there's always a sense of urgency and the threat of something bad coming your way.  It keeps you on your toes.  The theme is rich.  The majority of game mechanics are logical, rather than just mechanical.  For example, you may draw a card and be faced with a choice:  If you opt to eat from that goat carcass you found, be ready for some diarrhea later on, or choose not to eat from it and no worries, except that you might go hungry that day...

The first game was like being part of a adventure novel, although underneath another feeling was lurking.

Based on run through and two solo games. This game breathes theme and I am very excited about this game. The game is brutal and if the cards are against you, you're unlikely to win this one, but that makes perfect sense in such a brutal environment. Would love to play this more and to introduce this to other players, but the complexity and the length make it hard to get this to the table except solo.

Still, a definite keeper in my collection and if it would get more playtime likely to be in my top 10.

I have played Castaways previously, and was expecting Robinson Crusoe to be a big upgrade.  I did not find this to be the case...at least after one play.
It seemed to me to have the same basic formula.  Either play the way you are supposed to, or suffer a beating the entire game.  In Castaways the name of the game is to keep pushing exploration.  Robinson Crusoe may have the advantage that each scenario may have a different winning method, but that waits to be seen.
One other thing i learned in playing Robinson Crusoe is that my personal preference is to play these coop survival games alone.  I feel that the that you have to restrict your choices to be able to win does not make for a fun group experience.  Maybe it's just me...but the feedback I for from my groups tells me I might be onto something.
So...I will probably keep both Castaways and Robinson Crusoe in my collection...but only for solo plays.

Brilliant. Far and away the best cooperative game I've ever played...it feels like an adventure that never plays out the same way twice. The system lends itself to lots of different variations, as the King Kong and Zombie user-created scenarios show.  The first expansion was great as well. 

The rules in the original English set are terrible, a problem in a game that's has so many original ideas. The new rule book is a huge improvement, but its gigantic...not a game for newbies. With Portal's expansion into apps, I'm hoping that we will eventually see an app addition to Robinson, adding some new cards to increase the variety.

A great co-operative that provides a superb thematic experience, with the advantage that there are lots of different scenarious and difficulty levels to chose from, so it´s an adventure game but there are almost always new decisions and different surviving techinics to discover.
The game is also very weel conceived, as your options and decisions always have the right impact on the history sequence (they are consistent with each other).
The sad part of the game is that turns out quite heavy, with lots of events to pick and resolve, cards to flip at the right time, automatic mechanics that should not be forgotten, etc.
Because of all this, there is the tendency to appear some alpha player (which can even be a good thing) but, for short, it´s a really good game, although it would be nice if it was lighter.

RATING: 4
Played twice solo and twice two player (Castaway and Robinson Family scenarios), even though I've only logged a single play.

Robinson Crusoe (RC) isn't a bad game, but it's too frustrating and as a consequence, not as fun as it should be. It's such a brilliant idea for a theme, and unfortunately so much potential is wasted on a game that ends up way too random and punishing. For a game of this length and complexity, you should have much more control over your decisions. I realize that randomness was necessary for thematic reasons (being in the wild requires one to accept a loss of control of one's environment), but the gameplay suffers because of it.

The theme is great, but there are just too many things in the game that are unthematic. If the randomness weren't so frustrating, then perhaps I could ignore these unthematic characteristics. In other words, if the gameplay were so good, the theme would be irrelevant to me. One example is that you cannot choose a sustainable shelter or food production. For the most part, these things are only introduced if you are lucky (i.e. cellar). There is no way to begin the game trying to domesticate any animals or plant a garden. 

Another example is hunting. You don't hunt for a particular beast (unthematic), but rather draw randomly from creatures that require anywhere from 1 to 6 strength to defeat (without being wounded yourself). If I am hunting in a particular fashion, then I can limit the types of creatures I would encounter. Also, if it were thematic, then if I encountered an alligator, then I very well might avoid attacking and back away if I didn't have sufficient weaponry. You don't have that option in this game. 

Furthermore, the beasts all provide varying numbers of food. Without the ability to store food (or do anything with the excess) and without the foreknowledge of this food windfall, it mostly goes to waste. If it were thematic, then I would develop a way to store a lot of food [i]before[/i] killing a tiger, for example. 

I have to build up palisades in order to protect from wild animals? Again, this is clearly a fantasy made up by a designer who has no real knowledge of outdoor survival. Wild animals will rarely attack a human, and cases are very rare when it does happen (usu. due to being in between baby and mother or when cornered and threatened). 

Events are just plain ridiculous sometimes. The decision ones are too restrictive and often nonsensical. Other events are too punishing (i.e. not fun). There should be more items in the game to provide efficiency (such as providing extra action tokens). The "bed" item only benefits a player who rests during the day, and not during the night? makes no sense.

There are some good things about the game. I like the exploration mechanic and the ability to move camp. The icons in the game work well. The item cards are fun to use, as are the character abilities. Morale is a nice part of the game, as is the weather dice (although the amount of randomness should be reined in dramatically). 

It's great that there are multiple scenarios, and I have read through them. Unfortunately, the frustration I have with RC makes me not even interested in moving on to the other scenarios. The randomness of hunting and the events is played the same in all scenarios, which means I don't think I will like them any more than the first scenario. 

Such a brilliant concept wasted with flawed mechanics and excessive randomness.
The weather and animals encountered should have been more controlled based on the scenario. This would make the game more realistic and less swingy. 

Overall, I found the game too frustrating (yes, I got all the rules correct) and punishingly random. Instead of being fun to explore an island, develop various tools, and encounter neat events, it was a struggle just to keep from being injured making a shelter or suffering from freezing rain. Not fun at all.

Topping my favourite Co-Op Game "Arkham Horror" is not easy... but the Cursed Island did it, and it did it with style. Great replay value with 6 scenarious right out of the box, awesome production quality, amazing (albeit scarce) artwork, simple core mechanics (that somehow need a 40 page rulebook) and perfectly realistic decisions, that, altough tough and challenging, are fun. Maybe because we are not actually on the island ourselves, but thanks to Ignacy's awesome work, we now know, how it might feel...

RATING: N/A
It took a few turns to wrap my head around this one, and I'm still not entirely sure what just happened. There are a lot of things going on here. My first impression is generally positive, though. My main concern regards how dependent the outcome is on the distribution of tools and events. We managed a win by the skin of our teeth, but if we hadn't pulled a certain tool at setup, we wouldn't have come close to surviving. That is potentially worrisome for a game this long and involved.

This is a pure co-op  -- you don't really take turns; you all discuss what you're going to do as a team each round. And it's not for the faint of heart. But it's definitely interesting, and the varied scenarios suggest good replay value.

It's cool because there are a lot of things that need done, so you have to split up to do them. And, of course, splitting up to do different tasks creates unique challenges to completing each task. Sometimes you have to choose between survival and making progress toward your actual goal.

The rulebook for this edition is atrocious, and I spent 2 hours just trying to make sure I'd set up correctly before I could even begin to navigate how the game is actually played. Once you understand a few basically mechanisms, and realize theyre applied everywhere, its a pretty understandable game. But, boy, getting to that point...
Apparently this has been fixed in the new edition.

My wife and I play this every chance we get.
The rules and mechanics are pretty difficult to grasp, as there are a myriad of edge-cases due to the variety in the game, but once you get past that it's a really immersive experience; and once someone has a good grasp, it's fairly easy to introduce to others.
Also, brutally hard; although it's pretty luck oriented with event cards, the players have control over when the dice come into play.

[2014-03-10 Rating: n.a. -> 7.5]
When I first read about Robinson Crusoe, I did ignore it because I thought it was overly thematic. Let me explain this: For me, the mechanics are the most important thing in a game. The easier they are, the better. If the theme somehow matches the mechanics, well fine. But I don't really need this to enjoy a game. If the mechanics are easy to grasp but enable some deep gameplay and the theme is completely pasted on, I don't care. I don't need any fiddly rules that enforce the theme of a game. 

After watching some video reviews of Robinson Crusoe, I was left with the feeling that it had a lot of extra rules that are only in there because they help with the theme. And in fact, there are a lot of rules in the game that you have to remember. But all in all it's not as bad as I thought at first. So I'm totally fine with the influence the theme had on the rules and I can stand the fiddlyness of the game's core system since it's quite a lot of fun to solve this optimization puzzle that is Robinson Crusoe. Because despite of the whole theme and all the event cards that introduce new restrictions and obstacles, good play in Robinson Crusoe is all about identifying and making the optimal move under the current conditions.

Another thing I've lately come to realize is that I do like cooperative games solely because of the challenge and the puzzle they present to me and not because of the team play. In fact, playing a cooperative games with people often diminishes my enjoyment of them. The reason for this is that I want to win the game despite of all the mistakes I do normally make. I'd like to see if my (maybe stupid) plan works and if can win although I do make the wrong decisions all the time. I don't want the group to decide that something won't work, I want to see it by myself and lose if made the wrong decisions. So most of my ratings for cooperative games are for the solo variant of these games. This is also true in Robinson Crusoe. In fact, I did only buy the game so that I can explore it by myself and my rating is for Robinson Crusoe with only one player. With more players, I would rate it a 6. Although Ignacy Trzewiczek tried to eliminate the alpha player syndrome it's still there. This time you don't have to deal with someone who can surely know the optimal move at any given time but you still have the problem that there are people who are able to convince other people more easily than others. This situation came up in all the games of Robinson Crusoe I played with a group. Someone was always sure they knew the correct sequence of actions and was able to talk the other people into trying their solution. Guess what, I wasn't this person. Perhaps I should really, really try out Space Alert which is collecting dust on my shelf for some years and which seems to address this problem better than Robinson Crusoe.

But enough of my general rant against theme and cooperative games. Despite of everything that spoke against Robinson Crusoe, I do think it's a fine and solid puzzle game that seems to have a lot of replayability not only because of all the different scenarios that are included within the base game. The core system is solid and apart from some inconsistencies and timing issues the rules are quite clear in the german Pegasus Spiele edition of Robinson Crusoe. I'm looking forward to my next visit of the cursed island.

A fine co-op that offers a few tense moments.  It is oddly really brutal at times, though, which is a different sensation.  Instead of fighting an ever tighter squeezing anaconda, like you would in Ghost Stories or Pandemic or..., Robinson Crusoe gives you the false hope of "Here's some cake.  Here's a baseball bat to the nose.  Here's some more cake.  And what is this?  Cake?  Nope, a baseball bat to the nose again."  The end result is roughly the same either way - a difficult challenge to beat.  But the process along the way makes sure you can't really get a good read on how you're doing.  Also, the mechanisms for the gaining and losing health around the demoralizing points are nonsensical.

Played once and it was a very enjoyable game session and I would play again, although the game is not without it's flaws.

I did have hopes, given some of the comments about the game that I have seen, that it would manage to be a little more than just a group problem solver, however that is exactly what it is. It does succeed in presenting some interesting puzzles to solve but also comes up short in some areas:-

- Hasn't in anyway solved the co-op alpha-player problem - in fact it's even more prone to it than most. 

- The flavour text and artwork do their best to bring the theme to life but it doesn't quite succeed for me. It never escaped from being an exercise in managing scarce resources.

- I never really felt engaged with my character, the differences between them don't really seem to have much play effect, partly because the special powers are virtually impossible to resource.

- Functionally, the game would play identically if played solitaire.

- I also have a couple of doubts about the longevity of the game - once you have found the right strategy for each scenario (i.e. solved the puzzle) then replaying a scenario just turns into an exercise of how lucky you are with the card draws. I think there is an intention to provide more scenarios so this may not be an issue.

I was resisting to play it for a very long time. Then I was resisting to read the rulebook. In the end - after almost a year - I put it on the table. WHAT A GAME! To be honest - the best coop that I have played. Great thematic, theme, mechanic, custom dice, great scenarios, big variance in the base box... I am really, really amazed. I was seriously doubting that there is still a good coop game there - which is not about Cthulhu (as there are already too many games about Cthulhu and Zombies) - but Robinson has shown me that there is hope. 

EDIT: This game as every single coop - is great solo but bad in a group (at least for me). Rating going down to 7

I do love a good co-op game and this one contains some great mechanics, you have a little bit of worker placement, you have a little luck of the dice, a bit of push your luck and of course a mission to be completed by all team members to prevent certain doom!

Components are nice and everything fits into the box beautifully, I don't have any of the expansions or promos yet but I fully intend to get them, 4 players is the perfect number I think for this one, but it does play 1 and 2 (with the assistance of a dog and Man Friday).  A variety of scenarios are available and more can be downloaded I believe, each with varying difficulty.  Well worth a look if you are a fan of survival games and co-ops.

Sadly, this one doesn't make as much of an appearance in my house as I would like it to, but I intend to remedy that as I believe my wife would love it!

Tense cooperative game, which tends to create a atmosphere of desperation and increasing panic, which really matches the theme of being stranded on a mysterious island. The game is unforgiving and hard to beat. The fact, that it comes with a variety of scenarios keeps replay value up. The only minor problem I have with it is that there are no hidden objectives or any traitor mechanism, which makes it susceptible to alpha gamer problems and turns it more into a solitary-like puzzle. But what an intriguing puzzle!

This is probably my favorite game ever! If I chose to rate my games this would get a perfect rating :)! I love the game and the theme (realistic survival). Yes, there is a learning curve for the game's rules but once you get into it, it makes logical sense (aka: what would I do/what would happen in real life?). I am looking forward to purchasing ALL of the expansions and add-ons that come out for this gem (especially Voyage of the Beagle and the new Lost City of Z!). This is the one game that I would deck-out "to the nines" with custom pieces, inserts, etc.

This game is brutal and unforgiving. I love it! Why should survival be easy? Why should we always be able to get off the island alive? You shouldn't! Suck it up! Also, some find that this game has too much randomness but the randomness seems realistic to me. For instance, you roll dice for weather because no one can predict the weather. Also, you can always avoid rolling dice by allocating the whole day to an action.

If you have any questions about this game give me a holler! 
PS- Ignacy, You are the best! Please continue to make scenarios and expansions for this great system! I CAN"T WAIT FOR THE MYSTERY TALES EXPANSION... IT LOOKS AWESOME!!!

This is a game that I resisted. I bought into and was burned by the hype surrounding Mage Knight. That turned out to be a game that I hated, I respected, but hated because it felt too mechanical. So when RC was getting a bunch of mentions and some people who I really trust as far as their game tastes go were talking it up, I caved. What a fantastic game. The core engine is simple and straight forward. I love that it is a co-op where you do work together because it isn't a puzzle to solve but an experience to go through together. That's what sets it apart. That and it feeling very narrative despite a higher degree of abstraction. Just a fantastic design.

Such a brutal co-operative game! It's amazing how frequently, and how significantly, things will go wrong - and with thematic flair too. You'll hear a growl while exploring, or get stung by a mysterious insect while gathering, or do a poor job of making the shelter - with later, horrible consequences being directly tied to these events.

That said, this is probably the only good thing the game has got going for it. Behind it's massive difficulty, there's a fiddly and clunky game system obscured further by a poor attempt at a rule book. In most games, I tend to side on just playing it however feels best, disregarding whatever the rules might say.

RATING: 8
This is a really neat co-op experience.  It does a good job of conveying the feel of wilderness survival, with limited time to do anything and the constant pressures of hunger, weather, and wild animals.  The thick event decks also provide a good worry about the unknown and what might be waiting for you around the next tile or turn.  You have to overcome these problems and try to stay ahead of the curve by building labor-saving tools.  The small tech-tree of inventions is nice, and I like the way the basic ones are all out at the start but there are special ones available that change from game to game.  This variety, plus that from the different classes, starting items, events, scenarios, etc. give the game a lot of replayability.  That, and the fact it's nut-crushingly difficult, so you'll likely need to play a few times to win.

I'm not sure it's entirely balanced with 4 players, since you effectively have no way to get more food the first turn, meaning the majority of players starve the first night.  This, plus the nerf to the camp arranging action, can make it hard to get ahead on the morale race.  The rules are a real chore, and things aren't always written where I expect them to be.  Some of the card and scenario rules aren't clear either.  The iconography can also be difficult, though there is a key on the back of the book.

Anyway, I've enjoyed all my games of this, even the ones we've lost.  Looking forward to playing it some more.

This game is brutal! ...in a good way. Using action selection and variable player powers, you need to work together to survive on the island. Random events in the form of 4 different card decks keep play-throughs fresh and interesting. The base game comes with 7 different scenarios that all play completely different from each other, but I sometimes worry that once you figure out the basics of surviving, your actions could become monotonous.  The rule-book is terrible; I read through the whole thing multiple times before I understood what was going on. Just go online and watch a playthrough. It can be played solo, which is really nice.

It would be 10/10 if not for imperfect and inelegant rule set with a lot of loop holes and unclear specifications. FAQ and player aids are required to grasp every concept and enjoy this game without debates about what happens when and why.

Otherwise, definitely the best coop game with awesome deserted island theme and with best replay value so far (even without a single expansion, although they are available and very welcome). Very ruthless but with adjustable difficulty level.
Unfortunately, only up to four players.

RATING: 6
As is often the way with coops i quickly sour on them over time. This game is fairly unforgiving. Sometimes you need some vital fur and the hunt cards just don't produce it. That's thematic, fine, but given the long set up time and all the effort this game takes i'm not sure its worth it if often your decisions don't really matter. I often feel as though the main decision is what build order to go for, after that there's a bit of resource management but most of the game is determined by the card draws.

I don't normally go in for coops, but i quite enjoyed this. Gives you lots of options on your turn and has plenty of different mechanics and things going on (event decks, hunting, exploration, resource gathering etc). It also has some great custom dice. On one hand its very euro, collecting cubes to survive and win, but also has plenty of dice throwing and event cards to keep things interesting. I think it does a good job of representing challenges of survival and does well on a thematic level. I wonder whether it would play out for me quite quickly though.

A little disappointed after three solo plays. The theme is there but your options are really limited if you want to succeed. Build one item for "fun" or on a hunch and you won't make it. Really forces you to do things a specific way to win. Sure it's a challenge to find the "way" but i thought it would be more diverse.

This game is great for solo, but it is incredibly brutal, even with Friday and the Dog.  Having finally played it with someone else, we had a much easier time of it.  It's a great game along the lines of "lots of terrible things are going to happen to you", but if you are resilient enough and build a great resource machine, it's not as horrible as you might think.

What's exemplary about this title is the theme and the actual focus on co-operation.  A lot of co-op games involve a shared goal, but not shared anything else.  You win together or you lose together.  Here, I find that the co-op is greatly reinforced if you want to properly win your chosen scenario.  You must actively work together to ensure that the group survives each night while trying to build something efficient enough to reach your win condition, which often involves redirected much-needed resources to the scenario card instead of to your own pool.

Great fun when you're not really interested in bashing your friends' faces in.

I was initially really excited about this game, and committed to playing it ten times this year for the 10x10 challenge.

The rulebook is horrible. For our first six or seven games, it felt like we spent more time on BGG looking up rules than we did actually playing the game. I kept hoping that it would get better, and then I'd see why everyone loved the game so much.

Eventually it did get better, and the games went by more quickly, but they still weren't satisfying. I'd say the outcome is probably 90% based on luck, which does not really make for an enjoyable gameplay experience.

I'd actually say my first play was my favourite, when the luck worked in an exciting way and let us stumble upon a patch of mushrooms just when we were about to starve to death. But that was back when I still thought our decisions really mattered. Once I realized we were just going through the motions with a randomly determined outcome, my interest declined considerably.

Pandemic super-sized. It's hard not to admire designer Ignacy Trzewiczek for the brilliance of this production. The theme works, it feels like an RPG, the storyline comes through, and the game play is both robust and varied. Genius? Perhaps, but the game loses a few points for needing a game manager to keep track of everything that is happening, which always lessens the experience for me. Plus, this game is brutally difficult, and may make Ghost Stories, its co-op kin, feel like a walk in the park.

RATING: 2
Rules too fiddly and luck factor too high on a game so punishing. Alpha male issue is still highly present and a round feels like you accomplish little to nothing making the impending doom because of a bad role or bad timing of a card a game of high frustration and little reward.

I quite enjoy the puzzle and thematic nature but the rules are a little obtuse. Prefer to play several games of this after I get it setup so it's worked out best for me solo, but playing with 2 should also be fine. I'm not sure I would play this with 3 again (definately not 4).

This game is a strange little gem. Blends in a lot of mechanics and it definitely feels super-Euro, but with the most well implemented theme I have seen. The way the game jumps back at you based on decisions you made earlier is stunning. It is a difficult game (to beat, not to play), but when you beat a scenario it feels very rewarding. One of my new favorites.

What an amazing, tough, fun game. Win or lose, I always enjoy the experience. The story-driven aspect is fantastic, and the way the game is set up where you have to plan all of your actions at the beginning of a round really adds to the theme of the game. We feel like we are at the camp, starting the day, looking at what we have and what we need, at which point we have to determine who will do what but never know who will be successful, get hurt, fail, or have an adventure on the island. All the while, the weather changes, your party has successes and setbacks, your morale increases or plummets, and you fight to live on!

First game a bit messy experience. Lots of details and exceptions to note. And it was a long game with only two players. Got to move faster next game. I give it 8 for the variety, feel and detail. And it was hard to beat even at first scenario. Will be interesting to see next game if the story can keep up the interest. 

Second game was good. We won easily the first scenario in a 3-player game. Some discurs about how to use the extra meeple-actions correctly. And we cheated... we used Friday.

This is a great game. Decently thematic, with vast variability between scenarios. Resource gathering is tedious and unintersting, but all other actions are quite exciting. Sometimes the onslaught of negative effects becomes oppressive, but luck mitigation is available. The lengthy setup and nuanced rules make me dread playing it at times, and like most cooperative games, this game is very prone to 'quarterbacking'. However, all said and done this is one of the best cooperative puzzles published to date.
[Pro Tip: 'The Robinson Family' scenario is the best. All other scenarios feel tacked on in comparison.]

I realy do not get why people like this game so much.
The rules are hard to learn, and I have played a lot of games. It is a coop game but the board does not do enough. All the games we played we knew we were going to win altough we still needed a couple of turns. This is not exciting. The game should be hard for you on every turn. YOu should win the game very close. 
This game was a dissapointment for me, Arkham horror is exciting to the last card. Robinson crusoe, is not. This game is only exciting the first couple of turns. Once you figured out a steady food income you are just waiting to end the game.

This game unfolds like a Tarot Card reading.  There is a common experience unfolding on the table, a story which you are playing.  

The dynamic narrative that underlies each scenario provides ample opportunities for replay.  I've played three scenarios, of course scenario 1 being played most often at this point, and each time the scenarios varied enough that they were still engaging. 

The game engine is very open for interpretation, which I enjoy.  I find that most areas of uncertainty in the rules can be resolved by applying thematic common sense, the dog can't build a knife because a dog can't build a knife.  This common sense interpretation of the rules holds very well throughout the game.

A game designed to eliminate the alpha player by making every decision impossible to predict. However, an alpha player doesn't need to be able to predict the best move. They just have to think they know what the best move is. This game doesn't eliminate that. It also makes things very frustrating by ensuring you need to gamble on things, and also making the odds of succeeding at a gamble pretty low.

RC seems like a game I might enjoy solitaire (and I know for a fact the game is popular in the BGG solitaire community) but felt bloated with 4 players. Unlike other thematic dice games (such as EH or AH) where you run around a map and collect stuff to fight the game, there is very little player agency here.

Without players being in a physical space on the board or collecting individual items, players lose the feeling of associating with their character and see through the veil. So why have more than one person decide what actions to take each turn? 

And those decisions are really minimal. For example, you often are deciding to take a chance at being down, say, 2 food or 1 wood. Which is worse and how to address? Or as to what to build when the decisions are railroaded for you (for ex: roof > pot > shovel). You don’t need four people to make these decisions.

Yes, I like the way the events foreshadow things to come later, and I give the game credit for hanging together thematically, but my interest faded quickly due to the nature of the decisions. You just don’t need that many people to decide things here. It should be billed as a solitaire game.

Also, the game commits the sin of imbalanced powers. It's OK to make players fight against overwhelming forces, but you have to give them some powerful stuff to counter it (again, see EH and AH). That’s the unwritten contract of the game – get more powerful as the game does and then it's fun to trade blow for blow with the game. 

As it was, we were so, so poor in currency (determination), that we didn't get to use our powers very much, and when we did, they felt minor relative to the forces working against us. I would house-rule the game to give players more income so they can actually use their powers and engage with the game as individual characters. [i]Hey, look what I can do![/i] Why give players individual powers but then deprive them of the chance to use them? 

The answer to that question for me is because I think this designer is the Dan Brown of the hobby.

Easily our favorite co-op by a large margin.  Losing never felt so good!  

It is rather difficult to learn all of the rules without a FAQ or the insanely large errata.

The rating history on this one is fairly interesting too.  I forget where it started (8s?), but it slowly climbed up in rating after each play.  It's very satisfying when you get a win and I don't think I've ever had a bad game.

A in-depth adventure with themed worker placement chores. The least enjoyable aspect of the game for me is the fact that it is a co-op. it's just not my preference.

I like that the game is very unforgiving and that losing is more likely than not.

Regardless, I don't see myself playing this often.

RATING: 9.5
I love, love, love:
- the many scenarios to play
- the decisions between risking what to do quickly and possibly not accomplishing it vs what to do slowly but guaranteeing it to be done
- the encouragement to explore for helpful materials or terrain
- the agony of whether to take a bonus now but risk an event later or pass up a well-needed bonus to avoid possible danger
- gaining determination when failing at a goal
- the good mix of luck vs planning
- the really difficult challenge and unlikelihood of winning
- the new component quality
- the solid 4th edition rulebook

I dislike:
- that certain terrain allows for building certain things--how does this make sense?
- the success marking on the dice--did you know that's supposed to be a check mark?
- that no matter what beast you face, you always win albeit possibly with wounds

Final verdict: Fantastic game that's difficult to win and really brings its theme to life. Lots of replayability, great components, and well thought out use of luck only where it makes sense.

RATING: 3.5
I will readily admit that Co-operative games have a hard time with me in terms of seeing their purpose and rationale for play.  
Played once - 4 player.  Reason for the low rating is two  fold:
a) I didn't see that there was really much choice in the game.  Lots of luck when certain chits or cards were drawn yes, but meaningful player choice ? Seemed like the player choice is either extremely obvious or the choices of previous players determine what you do. 
b) Rewards - e.g. the tokens drawn from the bag didn't appear scalable yet the demands (food / shelter / palisade / weapons) were.   Experienced player's comment was "2 player, we've won several times, but 4 player seems impossible".  Didn't come across as balanced on the scalable options: = poor design/playtesting.  Also, seemed like the order in which the chits come out of the bag has a major impact on play.  

I will be very interested to see where this is in a year's time once "cult of the new" has worn off (It's position as I write this - Feb 2014 - at 13 seems overrated).

RATING: 7.5
[u]The Good[/u]: 1) The game has an engrossing theme, the rules reinforce this theme at every opportunity, and the components bring it all together - just a near perfect game, thematically speaking. 2) The replayability here is off the charts. The game comes with mountains of cards, and yet each play will only see a small fraction of them.

[u]The Bad[/u]: 1) The iconography was hard to grasp at first (in its entirety), which led to a moderate learning curve. 2) Maybe a game based more around luck than player skill. Think of it rather as a simulator of deserted island scenarios, than a matching of wits between player and game.

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: If you find the setting enjoyable at all -the whole: being lost at sea only to end up washed ashore on a deserted island, and having to find a way to survive- then this could be a great game for you.

A pesar de que trae un número limitado de misiones, la rejugabilidad es bastante alta, y en caso de agotarlas, hay un montón de misiones fan-made.

There's something I must not get here : the reputation of this game is that it is real difficult. Actually I have a strong winning record?!
Anyway, the game is tense, fast (about 30 minutes), I really enjoy my plays although I am lacking the difficult decisions it seems to imply... Likewise, the story telling is nice but nothing completely outstanding for that matter...
Am I missing something?

Great survival board game. It's a game with a lot of moving parts and is fairly difficult, but there's lots of meaningful choices to be made. It's an awesome experience with lots and lots of replayability.

If it's your first time playing and you're playing a 3 player game, add the dog to your group!

One of the top sandbox games out there.  This is a flexible system.  Scenarios take the game in so many different directions.  Varied characters.  Varied set up.  Varied cards.  Variety within variety.  Has a real RPG and storytelling feel to it.  But at it's core it is a euro action selection mechanic that asks you "Do you feel lucky?"  A fantastic game.  Second edition rule book makes it easy to learn, but you better set aside some time to learn it.  I have only played it solo and do not desire to play it as a co-op.

RATING: 7
Good game. Enough luck to make it interesting and unpredictable. It's got a serious flaw though:

Adventure cards and mystery cards. These are mostly bad. Optimal play (from my experience, played 4 times won three different scenarios) requires avoiding these if possible.

The adventures that allow you to gain something short term but lose something later on are almost never worth it, and the bonuses from mysteries are way to random and specific to be worth chasing. The result is that the game presents you with a lot of tempting options which you all turn down because the expected value is too small. While this might be very thematic (the last thing you want when stranded on a cursed island is even more adventure), it's also not much of a thrilling ride.

The solution could be to have a bit higher expected value, or be able to control the payoffs a bit better. (I don't want to risk wounds for a treasure that might be the barrel I desperately need, but might also be some warm clothes that I don't need at all). 

Still, the game is good. Recommended. But get Pandemic and Space Alert first.

[b]Narrative co-ops. I'm becoming a big fan of this sub-genre.[/b] My first exposure came with Knizia's co-op Lord of the Rings board game in 2002 (which I'm still playing by the way). Now this game - though almost ridiculously complicated to learn - also does such a wonderful job of creating story among players. I am curious to see how this plays over 20 plays or so, but the different scenarios provided with the game seem promising. Even playing the same scenario several times results is quite different challenges.

As much as I enjoy tight Euro-style co=ops (Pandemic, I'm looking at you), these narrative co-ops are amazing.

RATING: 7.5
Pros
-Enjoyable push your luck melded with worker placement
-Frequent game choices that force players to decide and weight in on short term gain versus long term loss. When you lose, you often can point to some reasons as to why beyond a single bad roll
-Numerous game scenarios (many difficult ones!)
-Lots of team work involved
-Events are frequent, thematic and fun (despite then mostly being bad, I still enjoyed drawing them and reading them)
-Well labeled and detailed game board
-Scalable from 1 to 4 players.

Cons
-Alpha gamer may still be an issue, but rarely is there one obvious path to victory
-Semi-difficult game can be a turnoff for some players
-Moderate to long game length can be a turnoff for some players
-Not that many options for resources on tiles seems odd (always only food, food/wood or wood) - always want to sit camp on food/wood.
-Only four playable characters.
-Some confusing rules

Reminds me a lot of Mage Knight: the rulebook is terrible, it's super-complicated, has a million card decks and chits and crams too much information in too little space, special rules everywhere, but is ambitious and tries to brings some depth and complexity to a genre that lacks it - in this case co-op games.

Some of the scenarios are hilarious, like wiping out the cannibal villages Rambo style...

Probably the best and most thematic cooperative there is. It has a lot going on, but once you get to know the game it does play pretty smooth. After the first few plays you hardly need to reference the rules.

I love how the game tells a dynamic story while you are playing with the event cards. It really feels like the island is trying to get you as the game progresses. I would play this any time of day.

Heavy-weight cooperative game.  This is one of the most complicated games on the list, but is a very fun challenge to take on with a group.  Set aside at least 2-3 hours to get through this one.  The best part is it can be played solo and has a ton of replayability.

This is a wonderful cooperative game, very tough, tight, and thematic. So far I have just played the first scenario, so I feel like I am missing out on a lot of what the game has to offer, as well as a lot of its complexity. This is an interesting game in that solitaire--especially with the right character--is significantly easier than with more players.

This is fantastic!  As a lover of all things Survival, this is a fantastic add-on.  I do know that the instructions could be clearer, both on the overall level and the episodic stage, but the game has quality play, fair replay, and some freedom for expansion at a fan level.  Perhaps most importantly, this feels truly unique.  I don't mind similarities within the standard genres of deck-building, worker-placement, et cetera (these are just examples; this is not a deck-builder), but it is nice to see a game that seems to break out on its own as a true novelty.

RATING: 6.5
Fúúú, nagyon nehéz ezt a játékot értékelnem, mert legalább három vetülete van, amik mind nagyon eltérő értékelést kívánnak. Talán vegyük külön őket:
1. Szabály 
Rettenet, borzalom. Továbbra sem értem, hogy hogy működhet így egy ekkora kiadó, mint a portal games, hogy képtelen szabályt írni. Már eleve a leírással is nagy bajok vannak, de szintén bajok vannak az ikonozásokkal, azonnal elérhető infókkal, amik minden esetben hiányosak. ráadásul úgy, hogy nem is sejted, hogy valaminek utána kéne még nézni. Ezen felül már eleve a szabályalkotásnál is iszonyatos bajok vannak, mert az egyszerűsítésről, streamline-osításról még életükben nem hallottak. Felfogatatlan dolgok vannak itt is, pedig ez a 3-4. kiadás már. Hatalmas nagy kár, hogy alapvetően szuper ötleteket fecsérelnek így el... :(
Értékelés: 2

2. A játékmenet:
Na ez már sokkal jobb. Jópofa közös túlélés, érdekes ötlet a közösen dolgozás az akciófázisban. Viszont ezzel van egy kicsi bajom is. Mert így ez egy szoliter játék lett, amit többen is játszhatnak. Az, hogy nemhogy titkos infód nincs, de még csak saját köröd se, amiben lekussoltathatnád a többieket, és magad dönthetnél, a legdurvább alfajátékos problémát generálja, amit valaha láttam. Ha pandemic-kel valakinek alfás baja volt, akkor erre rá se nézzen.
Értékelés: 7

3. A történet:
Na ez az, ami fantasztikus ebben a játékban. Nagyon szórakoztató ki sztorik kerekednek, ami egy nagy történetté is jól állnak össze. Ráadásul a rengeteg random tényező érezhetően mindig egészen más mesét generál nekünk. Egyértelműen ez az a pont, amiben ez a játék szuper erős. Igazából annyira szélsőségesen erre van kihegyezve, hogy kicsit olyan érzésem volt, hogy ez nem is társasjáték, hanem egy nagy közös mesegenerátor. És annak nézve szuper.
Értékelés: 9,5

Szóval összességében nehezen tudom társasjátékként értékelni. Így kerekedett a fenti szám.

too complex for game grp
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wildly unpredictable, fiddly and chaotic but it delivers a great story.

Unfortunately the rulebook is a mess (even after several editions) and the complexity, while explainable, creates too many situations not covered by the rules, leaving interpretation to the will of the players, something I dislike in games.

RATING: 6
I don't think Robinson is actually that different from most other coops. The major selling point might be the variability of a large number of random factors combined with the use of scenarios which significantly alter the winning conditions and how the game plays out. This variability, however, comes for a price: There is significant upkeep work to be done, lots of small parts add to the fiddliness, and the game can feel a bit procedural at times and run quite long.

A surprise hit! Each game tells a wonderful story, each turn can be agonizing with the number of choices and the limited actions, the random events out layer upon layer to the story, introducing complications and the occasional boon. 
The game felt similar to Arkham Horror, without the outré elements of course.

The first time around, reading the rules can leave you scratching your head, but as one becomes familiar with the design, the mechanisms click into place.

One of my favorite games in group or solo. The subtle interlocking mechanics really convey the impression of being stranded on an island with meager resources. The game can be punishing but making a few good key decisions significantly improve your chances. The scenarios are interesting and varied. The beautiful components complete this wonderful product. The rules are elegant and the game flows well. Unforgiving as it is, Robinson Crusoe will test the patience and possibly discourage some players. But for those who like a challenge and a very unique experience, it's a must buy!

RC is one of the more thematic co-ops I've played. This is on level with Merchants & Marauders in terms of thematic density. The mechanics have been designed to help the story along without getting in the way. Even though there are a number of moving parts, it is a fairly straight-forward game. That being said, the first scenario lacks some of the tension that higher scenarios would have as I'm sure this scenario was designed to be more of a learning game than one where players are actually threatened thoroughly with impending death. I'm going to read the rules again to see if we missed anything, but we played with someone who had already played 5 times before, so I'm pretty sure everything was covered. That being said, I enjoy how the theme of discovery, tool building, and fighting "beasts" come together. The different dice for the different actions is a real nice touch. The way the tool development works on a tech tree fits in with the theme well. I'd definitely play this again and probably would see my rating go up with a harder scenario.

I have really enjoyed playing this. This game is not so easy to beat but after quite a few plays you kind of get an idea what can be done to build up your chances of surviving the island. It's a brutal place, but if you get your shelter built, some good short cuts, and explore enough - all before the weather kicks into winter, then you've got a chance. It has a lot of scenarios you can play solo or cooperative. Every single game you play creates a story of what happened in your head.

RATING: 7
Robinson Crusoe does a more than adequate job at creating a narrative driven cooperative game. It's central mechanism is communal worker placement where people can opt to attempt to achieve actions individually or in partnership (the latter guaranteeing success).  This joint effort mechanic ties in well to the thematic drive of the game as well as providing some interesting choices in how to best solve the puzzle at hand.  

However, for everything good about Robinson Crusoe, it lends itself, more so than other co-op games, to a dominant voice.  Being that all information is open (in reference to each round) the player who is either most apt at reading the scenario, or is just more aggressive will control play -killing the intended experience.  

Robinson Crusoe is a strong cooperative game with strong narrative yet for me it doesn't sit alongside the tension filled LOTR or game play bliss that is Defenders of the Realm as a top tier game.  


UPDATE:  Robinson Crusoe can feel overly random at times and even create situations where the game is knowingly lost rounds before the scenario ends.  Familiarity also tends to chip away at the narrative creating a feeling of mechanics over story.  Still good, just not great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is one of those magical designs where each rule element is evident as an abstraction but inextricably tied to a thematic element or event. You can't really appreciate one without the other. This goes so far as to mesh the meta-game with the narrative itself, where the planning and coordination of actions is very much in line with a "Survivor" style deliberation that would be happening daily amongst a shipwrecked crew. My wife feels like the game is too "RPGish" for her, which is interesting considering how structured the rules are... but it does feel like an RPG in its own unique way.  Fascinating game.

This game is really good, lots of great ideas. Mr Trzewiczek is a good designer for sure, probably one of the world's greatest designers. Robinson crusoe is the best example of that designers wonderful mind. I love love love the adventures on the island, sense of exploration, dice rolling. EVERYTHING!!!  Wonderful game!!!

The game components and art design of this game are outstanding. The game is meaty and has a lot to offer. The theme is very strong too, it really feels like we are stranded on an island. The game mechanics of event cards possibly coming back to hit you later in the game is very elegant and I wish other games were using this mechanic more. It would have been great to have the same back of cards for all events though. As it stands the next event can get quite predictable just recognising it from the back of the card. The core game is also almost like a game system (makes me think of Time Stories from that point of view), as each scenario manages to feel very different from the others, and options for future scenarios seem endless.
I also like the fact each failed roll still gives you determination tokens, which will help future actions, so rolls are not just 'pass or try again later'.
On the downside, I would have liked to feel a bit more empathy for the characters. At the moment it feels like moving two nameless wooden disks on an island. Look at what Dead of Winter is doing for instance. Also, the game can feel hard and unforgiving. It is efficiency and risk management at its best but I don't like that one single failed roll or disappointing exploration often means defeat. The game feels organic as you are managing the decline of your character and try to achieve the objective before she/he dies, which to me feels a bit like being Di Caprio in The Revenant at times: a sensorial experience. You are feeling the starvation, the wounds getting infected, the fear, etc.
Finally, the game can suffer from quarterbacking.

An ultimate adventure game. Look here all you authors of Arkham Horror and other *^&* that should've never seen the light of the day! This is it!
Random, but heavily engaging and thematic. Cool.
Little too fiddly.
It's definitely Trzewiczek's Magnum Opus and one of the best games I've ever played.

Fun and challenging co-op in the first play w 2 ppl and Friday; great theme and seems to have plenty to do for each player. Won 1st scenario despite some missteps but could have just gotten lucky draws. Long set up and first time play but we were playing very fast towards the end. Want to play again soon. Manual could be better but we got through the game with only a rules mistake (thought you could only do 1 threat action each turn instead of both).

++++

Lots of plays later and we are all still enjoying the game (with a regular group of 4 players).  We've made it through the 4th scenario and are looking forward to challenging Cannibal Island (gulp/drool).

++++

Played through the last two scenarios - actually beat Cannibal Island first try (though I suspect we were VERY lucky and it was certainly a close call).  The Robinson Family scenario took us three attempts (one we lost from bad play, another bad luck - somehow managed to draw most of the book events at the start and got every 'discard invention' and 'flip finished invention' card in the game).  Still, very fun co-op game that we enjoyed immensely.  Sign us up for the expansion.

The solo game is quite difficult, even on the introductory scenario where you have to build a fire.  I died having almost built the wood pile, but hadn't even thought about building the fire "item" yet.  

This game is tough and almost feels like work, but I love it.

After four plays, I have finally beaten the first scenario.  What a weird and interesting co-op game.  There is definitely more of a co-op feel than, say, Pandemic, but it's still possible for one dominant player to take over the decision-making.

Very well rated cooperative shipwrecked survivor strategy game with a modular board and a event-driven deck.  Plays solo or up to 4 players.  Cooperative + exploration = must have for me, though it's a very 'fiddly' game with a boat load of tokens.  Very challenging which I like.  Perhaps like Arkham Horror, except at sea.

It took me 3-4 games to fully learn the flow and mechanics of this game. Until then, I kept forgetting certain manipulations and rules, which meant it wasn't all that much fun either.  But once I finally fully understand the rules, I couldn't stop thinking about this game. I have only played it solo, but it's really a perfect way to play it.  What's great about RC is that it comes with several different scenarios and each one plays in a completely different way, so each scenario almost feels like a different game. I greatly look forward to expansions, and I think I'll continue to be hooked on this game for a long time to come.

First Impression: Initial thoughts are that this is a nice, tight coop game with a good but not amazing narrative.  So it's not going to retire Arkham Horror in that respect.  The twist is that it is filled with agonizing decisions that also feel thematic.  Game is still quite vulnerable to alpha dog syndrome, but so is any complete information coop.

Update: I've had a strange relationship with this game.  I played a large number of times when I got it, I quite enjoyed it.  Then it dropped off the radar for almost a year while sitting on my shelf.  The next summer, however, I came back to it hard.  It is a gem.  Serious staying power, I can't believe I dropped it for so long.  It has huge replayability even with a single scenario.  Games are tight and challenging.  This game breaks out of the cult of the new and has become a go-to coop game---unlike most coops, there's a lot of "game" there, not just narrative, without being incredibly dry and unthematic.  

Update: A major achievement.  I've written more about it on Fortress Ameritrash, particularly its near perfect realization of consequences while respecting choice in gameplay.  It didn't start there, but it is now one of my 10s.

Preliminary rating.
This game is rather fascinating. It shines thematically, even though you're basically just 'building' a survival engine. It gives me a similar feeling to Agricola, in that your options are quite limited and just about everything in the game wants to damage you or destroy your supplies. (Which, as bad as it sounds, is a good thing in a game because it makes your decisions more important!)

It really is like Friday, but on steroids, with TONS more depth and replayability.

The game is super fiddly, a lot to remember, the rulebook and iconography are extraordinarily confusing at first, horrible layout, but once it 'clicks' you can run through a few turns fairly easily. I keep thinking that theres probably a better graphic design for whats presented, or a better way to explain whats what on the board (like just writing the word of what that action does instead of a symbol.)

Update: Lowered my initial rating. The last play of this seemed very uneventful. I didn't feel the tension, or the theming so much as an optimization of resource gathering. I still want to explore this more, perhaps we were just too 'lucky.' It's still fiddly though, that remains unchanged. ;)

RATING: 9
This is no desert island stroll. It's survival. Weather is brutal, food is scarce, beasts are fierce. In spite of terrible odds, building tools or just getting a roof over your head feel is rewarding in itself regardless of win or loss. It's almost funny just how merciless this game is, but it's a rich, involved challenge that leaves me wanting another try.

You can read the positive points anywhere, so I'll only list my gripes with the game.  I'm still rating it highly.

- Lots of bookkeeping, and fairly complex.  There's also a lot of symbols, which are not always clear on your first playthrough.  In a group of mixed experience, this means that inexperienced players will often just go along with the ride.
- It's basicly a solo game, all resources and items are kept in the "party pool", so players don't have any stuff of their own (except for "determination tokens").  There are also no player turns, you take your turns simultaniously as a group. The result of this is that you always must play "as a group", and decide everything as a group.  I realize this is a coöperative game, but I still like "playing my character" and making choices on behalf of my character.  This "it is advisable that everyone gets permission from everyone else before doing anything" style of play isn't really my cup of tea.

- The above two points, coupled with the fact that this game hase zero hidden player information, and is relatively hard, make it extremely vulnerable to the "alpha player syndrome".

Very nice cooperative. Preatty hard, you won't win from the first game unless you are very lucky.

While I'm usually not big on strategy games, this one fits the bill for me perfectly.  I like resource management, I like worker placement, but I hate the tendency of most Euro-style games to be competitive (since, yeah, I tend to suck at them) and the fact that very little of the theme or story has any bearing on what I'm doing.  This game is highly thematic, in that the choices you make always have a feeling of story progression, whether it be building up your habitation to protect from the weather or building inventions to unlock other inventions you will need in the future.  I also love the healthy element of chaos and randomness present in the card-drawing and dice-rolling, because adapting your strategy on the fly has fast become one of my favorite aspects of games.  If you want a game with Euro flavor but enjoy a setting where you can't always control everything, this one comes highly recommended!

First attempt and my brain exploded at confusing rulebook.  There's gotta be a better way to explain this game.  Seriously, somebody please find a way.  I had to rewatch gameplay videos to understand the game flow and know what my options were at each phase, and all the tiny rules.  Did a lot wrong on my first solo attempt.  Lost.  Kept trying to reroll weather dice to see if it was just dice hating me, but nope.  The game pretty much beat the snot out of me for 5 months in a row.

2nd Attempt, after watching the gameplay videos, much better.  I did a lot wrong on my first play.  This time I succeeded by October pretty comfortably.  The story really shined this time around...probably because I wasn't reeling so much from being beaten incessantly over the head with unfortunate events and had a little time to enjoy the journey.

The experience of this 2nd attempt is enough to make this game a keeper.  Can't wait to try other scenarios.

UPDATE: I've played Castaways and Cursed Island a few times now, 1p and 2p.  I'm STILL finding new ways that I've been playing this game incorrectly.  I appreciate that a game system in which alternate scenarios can be applied, that dynamically change the game's story is a major achievement in game design, but it's just a lot to keep track of with these finicky rules.  Overall, though, I think it's a winner and I'm willing to put up with the fussy rules and needing to read FAQs and quick start guides looking for clues about how to interpret certain situations.

UPDATE: Up to this point we had been hunting completely wrong.  It took 7 plays for us to finally play the game 100% correctly.  We beat the Cursed Island scenario 2p and on our 8th play, 3p, we beat the Castaways scenario.  The game is running smoothly now, and by that I mean I run the machine of the game and encourage everyone to do their best to stay tied into the story being told.  There's a lot of moving parts, and at times it feels like I'm the only one who knows how to keep the game together, but overall it tells a really compelling narrative and even my teenage nieces had fun with it on their first play.  After we won I explained all the other scenarios we can act out and their interest spiked even more.  I think I need to explain this game as if we're acting out a story.  People who approach it thinking we're playing a "game" might have the wrong idea.  It's hard work trying to survive on a cursed island.  

UPDATE: my wife and I have been playing.  We're stuck on Saving Jenny.   Poor Jenny.  Poor, poor Jenny.

UPDATE: played my first 4p games... died twice.  So much harder with more people.  Tried it twice and failed.  Came home and tried it by myself playing as 4p + dog + Friday and I completed the Castaways Scenario at the beginning of Round 11.  The roof is your friend.

UPDATE: played 4p again and lost miserably. SO much harder.  Agh!

UPDATE: 3p is perfect.

Scenario 5: Cannibal Island [8.75/10] - We won...on the last possible turn of the last possible round...but ONLY because we broke the spyglass for 5 free determination tokens.
Scenario 6: Swiss Family Robinson [7/10] - We won with 2 rounds to spare and 4 or 5 health apiece. Perhaps we had unusually good luck, but this one seemed a lot easier than the previous.  It also felt less thematic.  
Scenario 7: King Kong Island [8/10] - We lost! We completed the main task (finally) of setting 3 traps for Kong, but we ran out of time before we could tranquilize him.

This game suffers from the same issues many cooperative game have: no interesting decisions to take. It's thematic yes. But actually you try to get some cubes and you roll some dice for it. Repeat. As each character has some advantage in its domain it's obvious that the soldier will hunt, that the worker tries to get tools and the explorer explores the island (of course you can do different however). It felt way too scripted. The game captures the story well but mechanically the game is boring to me as it drags a bit (but this could be due the fact it was a first time game).

Very immersive experience, I loved the art.

Games are funny. Based upon a grokking of the rules, a love of the components and theme, etc, etc., it seems you should love a game. Then, every time you play it, with one or two or three or four people, everyone in your game group says, without variation, "why have I just spent two hours and a lot of coordinated effort pretending to starve?" Yet you keep the game, hoping that initial promise will pay off. 

UPDATE: Last line should read, "So you sell the game to someone who will hopefully enjoy it and weeks later barely notice it's gone."

We have spent countless hours playing it, and will no doubt spend countless more. Of all the cooperative games, this is my favorite.

I'm finally getting the rules down pat and I must say I quite like this game. The theme comes through very strongly for me. I like planning my actions for the day, what invention I should work on, let's take the dog hunting, send Friday off to clear up that event card before it does something bad ... It's fun.

Surprisingly I still haven't beaten the first scenario and I won't let myself try any others until I have. I'll get it one day!

Strasznie dziwna gra... Jak na worker placement dość nietypowa (kooperacja) - pod tym względem na plus. Reszta, mimo że dość spójna, raczej nie porywająca i jak dla mnie zrobiona mocno na siłę. No i co ta gra ma wspólnego z Robinsonem, to już na zawsze pozostanie zagadką ;]

Nie lubię kooperacji. Szczególnie takich, z pierdylionem zasad, gdzie gracz znający je najlepiej gra za resztę.
Ale w Robinsona paradoksalnie lubię grać. Wyraźnie wyczuwalny klimat, a spora nieprzewidywalność (wydarzenia, rzuty) nie pozwala do końca grać za innych.

Well-designed and thematic, but unforgiving and punishing. I've never managed to win scenario 1. Sometimes when I think about playing the game, the thought of the long set up, followed by the frustration of play is enough to make me decide to play something else. That has lowered my rating, but I still like the game and want to keep trying.

We have played 14 times and have completed all 6 scenarios included with the base game. My biggest gripe is that the scenarios seem to vary wildly in difficulty. It is strange that we found the last 2 or 3 very easy, while the second and third were the hardest. The first scenario was fairly easy as intended. We used the exact same setup for each one in number of characters, event card mix, etc. I think the game should have scaled to make the later scenarios much harder. We shouldn't have been able to beat scenarios 4,5, and 6 on our first try. We didn't scale the difficulty up because we found 2 and 3 fairly difficult. 

We are going to play through the scenarios again with a greater difficulty. I will increase my rating if it scales up well, and we see some replay value in the scenarios. Each scenario seems to have a certain trick in how you have to play it to win. I am not sure the random event cards add enough variability to make the scenarios very repayable. Perhaps it would be nice if there were more than 3 characters available for 2 player games. 

Even with its potential flaws, I rate this game high because it has no problem hitting the table. I am always excited to play it as is my primary playing partner. As an added bonus I can solo anytime I want. Each turn there are always interesting decisions to make, and the best route is not always clear. The theme, components, mechanic - it is all great. If I can get the difficulty to scale and good replay ability it will be a perfect 10.

A very good game, but not for the timid. It tends to be very hard, especially the first few times it's played. The feature/bug of basically losing the game on your first turn without even knowing it is interesting. The first playthrough, for example, we didn't realize waiting a few rounds to start gathering wood had already doomed us. Good or bad, the suspense is strong and teh theme is terrific.

I just don't like games where you don't play the way you want. Instead you discuss with the others and all agree to do whatever the group agreed on. I find it boring and it lacks a key feature each game should have and that's my very own decision.

A great game if a little tricky to get down with the way the rulebook is written. I used the quick start guide by maxixe in the files section which cleared up a load of things for us. It can be tough though. We finally completed the first scenario successfully after 3 games by capitalising on a couple of lucky breaks, (doesn't happen too often). The theme really comes through for me and it really does feel like a struggle to survive.

It seems pretty obvious that Robinson Crusoe is a game that revels in its top-down design. That is, the mechanics are an outgrowth of the theme, and not the other way around. And yet the co-op aspect and worker placement all make this game feel comfortably familiar. It's a good balance.

Players will need to split up the tasks of managing their camp, collecting items, preparing for natural disasters, etc. Some have complained that this can lead to one player trying to boss all the other players around, which could see happening, but that's an issue with the players, not the game itself. It wasn't a problem in my experience.

Co-op players who love games like Pandemic may find that Robinson Crusoe simply offers too much. Every action is handled a bit differently and every item performs a different function. These are easy to remember because the mnemonic of the theme is so prevalent, but it there is still a lot of rules overhead. For me, I found that to be a necessary evil to deliver the narrative experience of your titular adventure on the cursed island, but it is unlikely to evoke adjectives like "crisp", "clean", or "elegant". 

Is it too hard to win? Too easy? To ask these questions is to miss the point of the game. Not that your play will not improve as you learn the game, but if you aren't enjoying the story-driven experience of this learning process, it may not be the game for you.

Fun game and I like a lot of what it offers. Subtracting a full point for not-so-great rulebook (no index, hard to find clarifications about many things in it) and many cards where the rules aren't really clear.

RATING: 7
I don't like coops and especially not those whose difficulty stems from constantly smacking you down. Insofar it's almost sensational that I do find "Robinson Crusoe" intriguing. It has enough flavor to justify it's meanness and it has enough building-up that you feel some acomplishment and not only have the sensation that you're hanging on to your dear life. Not something I'd play all the time, but as far as coops go, I'm cool with it.

I had this on my wishlist for half an eternety until I finally got it. It's a great game, and does coop really well I think (though I've only played it solo to date).

The rulebook could be a lot better. Reading it, at times, makes it feel like the game must be really complicated to play - things are laid out a bit confusingly, to me, at times. Actually playing the game is a lot smoother though (barring the occasional rules uncertainty, where BGG comes in really handy).

The game is tough, but beatable - feels fair overall, though randomness of course can foil the best-built plans. As it should in a game like this: It introduces a feeling of adventure and excitement, and occasionally dread, and models the unpredictability of lonely life on a desert island.

Why do I need 10 elements if one is enough to achieve what needs to be?  That's a fundamental question every designer should ask himself, whether working as an artist, software or game designer and that's the approach missing in the game.

Nice components, although some tokens should have been cards (ie. discovery tokens).

Learning curse may be steep for the first game, as there are lot of different tokens and cards.  After one play, everything should be clear, as the system becomes intuitive.

Pretty good co-op game of survival on a desert isle. A lot of different tasks have to be accomplished, so players can work on different objectives and all be contributing to the whole. Dice roles can mess with your plans though, sometimes causing you to fail your task, or activating further misfortune in the form of various event decks. So, there's a lot of luck, but trying to overcome it is kind of fun. Really great presentation.

A game that thrives off intensity! Every round, you can feel the pressure build up! It makes you really stress out over every single decision, as you know deep deep down, failure is inevitable. The different scenarios really breathe life into it as well; each scenario forces a different play style and way of thinking in order to be successful ! If you're looking for a co-op for people who like to sit down and challenge themselves mentally, and are okay with dying in really saddening ways, Robinson Cruscoe is the game for you! (I swear to you that I actually like it...)

Better than average cooperative game. It has a lot of small rules and mechanics to keep track of, making it a bit complicated and it seems it would be easy to forget something crucial. Because there is a lot going on and each person has a role, it seems a little less prone to the problem of one person "guiding" the others through the game. The scenario we played seemed quite difficult and the game ended suddenly after two events piled onto each other.

First of all this game is one of the most thematic games i have ever played. The rules are complicated however the gameplay is elegant. Most of the actions are coming from the theme and can be understood easily. The game tell you a story. You and your few friends are on the dangerous cursed island trying to survive. The game is about endless torment about not to die. The scenarios are quite different from each other so lot of replay ability granted with the base game. Be prepared to actually win a game is quite a heavy task. One little mistake and you find yourself that half of your life has already gone. The artwork is outstanding and helps you a lot to imagine your adventure.

One of those rare games that keeps me thinking about it long after the game play ends.  It took me one session dismiss this game, but 5 months later I eventually picked it up and again and the second session solidified it as one of the best games I've ever played.  Don't be mistaken, you'll lose far more than you'll win, but that makes the wins so much more enjoyable.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice not having this game in your collection.  If you don't get it the first go-around, give it another try.  You'll be glad you did.

I love survival games. Being stranded without supplies, finding some and trying to stitch together a plan with what you've found. Robinson Crusoe does an excellent job at this, presenting you with some options and letting you grow out your own adventure from them. Speaking of adventure - the card system is really cool. I love how the game's foreshadowing system works and how events can bite you later.

Underlying all of this however is a stunningly designed game. The worker placement works very well and I always feel like I have a ton of options on my turn. The scenario system also helps to form your general strategy. And the game is tough as nails which keeps you challenged and coming back for more. The solo game gives you access to some extra workers and plays really smoothly. Really there's just nothing this game doesn't have - it's superb

Best with 1-3 and good with 1-4

When Friday got rabies I pretty much gave this an instant 8.

A master class in rules exceptions, except where those exceptions are excepted.  In that case, you'll have [i]no idea[/i] how the hell it works.  Ideally, a game should have exactly zero rules exceptions, and every failure of that ideal should be completely necessary (i.e., the game won't work without it, and there's no way to rewrite the rules around the issue) and, perhaps more importantly, every exception must be [i]utterly obvious and memorable[/i].  The rules here are an [i]if-then-BUT[/i] mess, making for an awful lot of pretty big buts.

You are most definitely gonna need these to help figure it out:

Ultimately, the way to play this as intended is to not worry about playing this as intended and just kinda go for it—otherwise you will drown the fun-baby in a murky bath of rules, rules exceptions, botched rules, beetle-browed page-flipping and anxiety.  Squint, wave the the hand and play through.  You can always get closer to the thing next time.

First game went really well! I mean, we died and even if we hadn't we were far away from building the signal fire. But we had fun and my wife wanted to play it again immediately! We couldn't as it was Sunday night and I had work in the morning, but it's a really good sign. 

[b]Update:[/b] I traded away [thing=30549][/thing] around the same time as I got this game as I hadn't played Pandemic in 4 years (plus I'm really hopeful for [thing=161936][/thing]). This one got played 2 days in a row and we are shooting for a third! It's considerably more thematic than Pandemic (or anything else I have, TBH) and we are more driven to beat the game.

A melting pot of trillions of cards, tokens, plastic and wooden cubes. The English is odd on more than a few occasions, the rules are disorganized, and setup and take-down times are outrageous. 

The game kinda works, but only if you can look through its shortfalls. They REALLY should have tried to simplify a lot of stuff to improve the game. I also wish that the characters felt more individual to each player. 

It is a bit too long, complex, and luck-driven to warrant an 8 with me and my gaming partners, but it works okay as a solitaire, if you don't mind the setup time.

Wonderful present of my Secret Santa in 2013

This is THE most thematic cooperative game I know (which are at least SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT, SHERLOCK HOLMES, PANDEMIC, FORBIDDEN ISLAND, FORBIDDEN DESERT, GHOST STORIES, FLASH POINT, HANABI, LEGENDS OF ANDOR to name a few).  It only takes you one round to realize all the perils you are facing a castaway. Brutal but so rewarding gameplay. Looks complicated at first with seemingly endless rules. But it falls together very well and plays very naturally. Brilliant! Also love the great variety this game offers with 6 scenarios, always differing tools and events so that no game plays the same. One time you feel stranded on an icelandic island battling frost and snow. The next time its a tropical island with food in abundance but wild animals all around you.

Sure, there could be a problem with a dominant leader as in many other cooperative games. This has never been a problem in my groups.

RATING: 7
8.0 based on first play. We beat the first scenario handily, which makes me think we played the game wrong. Towards the end we did realize that we were making some minor--maybe a little more than minor errors. First, we didn't realize that invention cards go in the unavailable resources slot. (For those who don't know the game, the resources you acquire don't become available until the next round. This includes tools you build, apparently). We also didn't realize that helper pawns (which you get by building tools) must be played with real player pawns. I'm not sure if either of these made a huge difference (since we always could have just sent a solitary player pawn instead of a solitary helper pawn). We might have just gotten lucky, since 3 of our 4 randomized invention cards were helper pawn cards (in other words, extra workers). We also were incorrectly healing too much with the fire place (allows you to trade food for +2 heals, but ONLY 1 food. We were trading multiple). This probably made a huge difference, since my constant supply of determination tokens allowed me to kill beasts and retain an ample supply of food. 

Anyway, this is probably the most fiddly game I've ever played. I didn't really become immersed in the theme(like so many say you do) because I was struggling to remember what every little chit and token represented. I also found the rulebook downright infuriating. Every rule you need is in there and, if you can find it. But the rulebook is like a lesson in recursion. Some rules are in completely unintuitive sections, and very important rules are segregated in "example" boxes for no apparent reason. Further, these example boxes are often not even near the section requiring the example. If you play, I'd highly recommend using the community created resources in conjunction with the rulebook. 

Having said all of this, the game is beautiful and I can see that it has potential. Learning games are always rough if you don't have someone to guide you, so these comments should be taken with some grains of salt. I think this game can be everything that people claim it is, by about the 3rd play. But be prepared to be disappointed when your first play is bogged down in fiddly rules, tokens, and a poorly organized rulebook.

Edit: Everything that I was confused about also confused at least a few other people on BGG. So, this is a rulebook problem.

很棒的角色扮演/合作遊戲，非常豐富的隨機事件/工具/寶物，很有特色的角色設定(可惜角色有點少)，每次玩都是不同的體驗，最厲害的我覺得是劇本每個都設計得很有故事性且玩法都很不一樣，且bgg上已經有許多玩家自製劇本可下載。
缺點嘛...這遊戲很吃骰運，爛骰太多是會滅團的，計畫總是敢不上變化啊...
作者Ignacy Trzewiczek曾寫過一篇文章："Are you designing game? You better have Vlaada Chvatil in your testing group!"，文中Vlaada很直接的打槍了當時還在play test的魯賓遜遊戲機制的不合理，被打槍後的Ignacy耿耿於懷的反應也很有趣，後來原本的機制被拿掉，加入了現在的士氣條，如果沒有Vlaada，這遊戲可能不會這麼棒。這篇文章也收錄到他的書中"Board games that tell stories"，有機會要收這本書來看。

It was an ambitious goal but unfortunately the bad things balance out the good for me.  -- The rules & bits are very fiddly
-- There's not much narrative that occurs just a bunch of random bad events
-- It's probably best to play solo
-- There's an unbelievable amount of luck
-- The cannibal scenario is the worst

Maybe some of the fan-based scenarios will be better...

Co-ops are a tough sell as gamers tend to be a competitive lot. This one has a lot of moving parts, but the sense of imminent threat is less well developed than it is in Pandemic. It's certainly easier to win with more players as you have more actions and more special abilities available. The first scenario wasn't too hard to win with 4. Oh, and the text and icons on the cards are ridiculously small.

Outstanding. Great solo, great with a group. Tough and harrowing and thinky and yet somehow also exhilarating and tons of fun. The various scenarios all feel completely different from one another, giving you a LOT of game in the box. The only things keeping it from being a 10 are the constant fiddly upkeep, the difficulty getting it to the table, and the challenge being just a hair too unforgiving. Small complaints though. A highlight of my collection.

Heavyweight, full co-op with a shipwreck/survival theme. It's kind of a fusion between ameritrash and euro gameplay, leaning more towards euro; some minor dice-rolling and uncertain card-draws, but decisions are mostly deterministic. There are multiple scenarios, and they all have some goal beyond just survival.

This is the perfect thing to play if you have a few hours and want a grueling full co-op experience.

Setup is an absolute beast. It's the only thing that has soured us on the game. Unfortunately, there isn't really an analogue for it. Maybe Dead of Winter in full co-op mode on a higher difficulty? That's all I could really think of.

Kind of like a co-op version of Agricola, where you struggle to feed your "family" and keep them alive, while trying to get what you need to fulfill the scenario's requirements.

Played this twice (enough to know I don't like it).  Embodies the concept that cooperative games must be action grinders where you get a very limited number of actions and you must waste the majority of these simply to survive (in effect you throw away these actions doing nothing to help you win).  Its amazingly frustrating because you can spend the entire game collecting food so that others can attempt to take actions to meet the requirement to escape the island (and that's called cooperative).

This is a gigantic miss.

What a thematic game. It opened a new dimension for coops for me and my wife. Really, really love this game. It is challenging, there is no clear right and wrong. The luck factor fits the theme really well and can be reduced if you pay the cost. It is up to you how often you want to roll the dice, how dependant you want to be on card draw. That is fantastic. It plays well with all player counts. 

The most terrible thing about this game is the rule book. Even after really studying it hard, having a test play and so on we still made mistakes which were discovered after way too many pays when we met with friends who also own that game. They also made some mistakes, all different from ours. So expect to have a hard time at first.

I'm thinking this one is too punishing and too random for me.  There's a LOT going on mechanically for not a tremendous number of decisions (This is really a solitaire or 2p game; there's not enough for a larger group of players to think about if they have much resource management game experience).

The modular approach that allows for thematic scenarios is very cool, though.

[b]Solitaire Review:[/b]

This is definitely the most immerse experience I have in my collection. Every game, it becomes less about solving the puzzle, and more about survival the weather and making sure I have the resources needed to live another day. I've truly started thinking of the yellow cubes as physical food I need to live, in this gem of an experience. 

As I've slowly whittled away at each scenario, I'm always left with a desire to go back to every challenge and try to outdo my previous score. I really have enjoyed the Solo experience of Robinson Crusoe as much, if not more, than playing in a team. Just like a good novel, I get totally lost in the story every time, with minimal distractions around me. 

The randomness is what drives the difficulty of the game, and at times can be infuriating. The card draws fit the story the game is telling flawlessly, just leaving enough for your imagination to fill in the blanks. However, some events, scenario situations and activity cards are so devastating when activated in tandum, that it sometimes seems excessive and hardly fair. 

Overall though, the game has it's claws in me and I can't wait for future expansions and to get to the the King King and Doctor Livingstone scenarios that have just  arrived from Portal publishing. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Impressively immerse
- An unbelievable amount of scenarios that utilize an already impressively repayable system. 
- With the help of the BGG phase order sheet, the game plays very smoothly and quickly for it's overall weight. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Lots of holes in the rules, so you often have to think thematically to move things along. If you think thematically however, the result is often very satisfying, be it good for you, or devastating.
- Apart from the randomness and rules, there is nothing bad I can say about the game.

One of the best games ever designed along with one the worst rulebooks ever written.

I love, love, love this game. It's co-op and it kicks our ass every time we play.  Even when you win, it hurts. When you lose, it's epic. A game that will elicit a cheer when the weather dice are kind to you and will pull high fives from around the table. It's a game that makes people wonder what you are playing and want to be a part of it.

RATING: 8
The dice can be a bit swingy, I would prefer more after rolling mitigation feel instead of the safe action with two tokens or a gamble with one mechanism, but I am aware that would be a very different experience. I like it for the difficulty but it can be a somewhat long for a game that has this much luck and not that many ways to mitigate it.

Played twice but looks like you can't really recover if you roll badly. Failed 80% build rolls. Friday died turn 3 and I succumbed to the elements on turn 7. I fared much better on the first play dying on the last night phase from a headache. Just had to place wood on the pile the next turn.

A brilliant game that recreates the feeling of being a castaway. The game could have easily just been the initial scenario and with the number of random elements to it, it would have been a successful game design. By incorporating 6 different scenarios though, with two more available online, this game is something special.

The theme sounds like something I'm very interested in.

After a long wait during the pre-order (ordered Jan. 2013, delivered 8/15/13), I've finally got it!  Set it up and played 4 practice rounds with Tina that first day, really liking it so far.

Have gotten quite a few plays over the first months of ownership, and this is a really great game.  The mechanics and theme are very well integrated.  The only negative thing I can say about this game is that the translations in some places are quite bad, which hurts the immersion into the game.

RATING: 8.5
Great game!! I love it. The game is super thematic, everything you do is there, you can feel the game breathing theme. The basic survival mechanic is very well done, it makes all the sense in the world and it is fun. With only that mechanic and maybe just fighting for survival, the game would have been great but, in addition, there are several scenarios, uniquely designed, it is not just a standard paper with different information in every subchapter, no, every scenario has a unique configuration, every mission feels completely different, you can see perfectly that you are in a doomed island, or trying to film King Kong, or just surviving... and it is true! 
You also can create your own scenarios or try one of many that can be found on the internet.
Positive:
1. Highly thematic
2. The survival mechanics work very well
3. The scenarios are very different
4. Everything that happens makes total sense from theme perspective
5. The number of players can be very variable. A two-players game works very well
Negative:
1. It may be a bit difficult
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The game is real FUN.  That is once you get through (preferably - master) all the rules, details and possibilities.  It requires 1-2 plays.  But once you pass that point the game becomes a jewel: with complex decision-tree, non-obvious choices, thematic and demanding.

The theme is integrated into mechanics, cards etc. BEAUTIFULLY.

The pressure from the game is high - it punishes you severely.  Not something for the faint-hearted.

6 different scenarios are SPLENDID idea helping the replayability.

RATING: 9.25
Crisis management: Resource management hell: Story-driven: Push your luck: Full co-op: Dice

VERY strong themed game which includes a storyline, to me this was by far the best aspect of the game due to 'which' theme it is and how underused/original it is, and how well integrated it is, I think we mostly 'felt' we were on this Island and trying to survive which was cool. 

Gameplay was FUN actually, due to the nature of the events and the push your luck aspect, but also stressful at times as well. If you don't like the stress/challenge of ITYOTD or Gric, you might as well steer clear of this one, too. (two more reasons I DID like it)

I was worried about the dice, and how much the luck might effect things but after playing that worry is almost gone. Its a factor, and one that constantly needs to be accounted for but can be mitigated too at times, just not all the time. On the set of dice we seemed to use most there was a 66% chance of success, and our success rate was more like 75-80 so this helped, the other sets are tougher in general so beware and PLAN to get hosed more if you take the chance with those. Note that 'usually' a bad roll here or there is NOT too critical, and you mostly get to decide where to push your luck, however deciding not to (push your luck) costs you an extra action EACH time, and you really don't have actions to spare....There is card draw luck here too, probably not much different than any other similar game but when the two aspects are combined you can see that no matter how you cut it, its just a factor you have to accept going in and a trade-off for tension and realism.  

I really like the idea of having different scenarios here and see several benefits like adding to the theme/story-telling, reducing the feel of a static board (Map is also modular) and having different goals to help keep the game fresh and different each time you play a new one. After only one play its hard for me to comment on the tactical versus strategic nature, I think its slanted for sure but do think you have to stick to an overall plan based on your scenario and how you want to approach the game from what is available (tools, etc) and what becomes available, you are also forewarned of future bad events so I don't think its w/o planning and fully tactical at this point at all. 

Critique's would be rule clarity, again, but also not the easiest game to learn due to just shear amount, its a little more involved than your average co-op and also runs longer too, first scenario was a good 2 hours (note that gameplay is actually pretty straight-forward however and this was also 4 player and our first game though). In its defence here, I will say that any 'realistic' game I have ever played (that I can recall) was NOT light on rules, so here too for the theme to really shine I think its likely a necessary sacrifice and worth it. Significant set-up. Fiddly with bits moving all over the place, I don't take off much or anything for that, but you might. I don't see the dominant player issue solved here, but I knew that going in and now agree with others who said it but note decisions are WAY less obvious than in something like Pandemic so this does help. Its full co-op, and everyone needs to be [i]involved[/i] for sure using their special abilities and in negotiations/team work but a DP can still try to control everything if he chooses to (Maybe later scenarios address it more? Not likely)

Not sure what number might be best, maybe 3 might be a tad shorter than 4 but overall my best guess says this should scale very well 1 right to 4. Oh, technically it has a worker placement mechanic, and we're all tired of that but don't worry, I didn't even notice its the theme that stands out, NOT the mechanics.  

[u]Update[/u] - Did I mention the game was Brutal? This game won't be for everyone, crisis management is punishing and not everyone enjoys it for sure. Have played twice more and lost the 2nd scenario both times, really like the game its VERY well done imho but the rule look ups are taking a toll on us, FAQ helps but needs to be polished and completed to be fully useful.  Likely will settle at 8.5 rating for me once rules hopefully become smoother in play (card effects and such keep giving us hiccups) and I think it's the best 'serious' (non-party style) co-op to date

[u]Update[/u] 8.25 => 9  A bit of a bigger jump than I thought, just really enjoying the game and the rules are finally melting into the background letting the game shine.  The book is fairly good for the most part, the FAQ really needs completing and better formatting though.  

This is the type of adventure game I have been waiting a LONGGGGGGG time to play, it feels very complete in that it has everything you would want in an adventure, is challenging (damn hard at times) and highly immersive AND your decisions feel meaningful, the last part usually does NOT go together with adventure, sooooo many examples.  Mage Knight also does that last part right, but note I have only played that once so far and those rules were brutal too. Robinson has: Exploration, hunting, treasures, traps, monsters, building tools, slight tech tree, a different goal and other aspects to each scenario, lots of story telling events, characters with different variable powers (maybe character development only thing missing?), weather, building a camp with different aspects including the upkeep of these, constant need for food, constant resource struggle, never enough actions or time, and likely a couple more I am forgetting. 

Robinson is an excellent game and really well designed, and is especially enjoyable for anyone that enjoys crisis management. Luck plays a role and sometimes more than others, but after 6 games I only felt it really influenced the outcome once (that I can recall anyway) and as I noted before many times you can mitigate the luck by choosing NOT to push your luck, I think the luck could be a tiny bit high only or maybe even just right, its not bothering me at any rate (I should note I care about luck less in co-op's since I'm not competing against others). Playing really brings me onto the Island and escaping everyday life much more so than many games, and this is a big reason I game in the first place so top marks for immersion from me.  My Rating is likely to stay here, if luck was just a little lower and the game was just a little more strategic it might have hit a 10 for me, I do think its that good. Game should also have good legs I think too if not overplayed, since there are now SEVEN scenarios (and more coming) as of this writing and they all look damn tough to beat. 

[u]Update[/u] 9 => 9.5  A few more plays and the game is a masterpiece really, and really reminds me of Agricola in many ways, including having a bunch of tempting cards around potentially diverting your attention from your core goals.  Most likely going to be a 10 for me and will make it into my top 10 (now in my top 20), the theme is so strong and game tells a great story, its so immersive and really fun to explore (literally and figuratively), discover and play as long as you can take the beat down it dishes out, and combined with great strategic and tactical decisions you have to make, it’s just a great great game imho and so many great elements that come together beautifully. 

The last worry I have left now might be that we may be on to an optimal way to play, one that will more or less work for each scenario. It's only a very slight worry as of now, and only more play will tell me whether its just that and hopefully nothing else.  

Awesome job on this Ignacy, thank you for this GEM and the great adventures.

Fun coop, there's a sense of challenge but it feels fair. And finding the right balance between not having to roll dice and doing enough things is interesting, in fact probably a big part of the real decisions of the game. Though how to use your resources is also a serious question, and in that regard this game feels more proactive than a lot of other coops which in my experience usually feel more like continuously cleaning up after messes the game generates. In this game you start in the hole and you work your way out, the game trying as hard as it can to slow you down but rarely actually reversing your progress.

It's hard to rate this after just one game, especially one that last only 4 turns before the Explorer died! That being said, things were starting to get interesting and this seemed more cooperative than a normal co-op game, for whatever that's worth.  Not usually my style of game but I appreciate the theme and would love to try it again.

It's an okay coop.  I played it once or twice.  It's sort of a cross between a coop and an economic game as the group builds up its resources by gathering some raw materials and using them to put cards into play representing things like a wall or rope or whatever.  Meanwhile bad things are happening and you are exploring the island to find spots to get the resources you need.  I like economic games and there are real choices to make together and the theme comes across well.  I don't like it as much as some other coop games like Space Alert or Battlestar Galactica or even Pandemic as it didn't have the same sense of tension and impending doom.  I'd be willing to play it from time to time if the group really wanted to but I wouldn't suggest it on my own,

I won't add anything about Robinson Crusoe except to say I agree with the positive reviews.  This is a co-operative game with a huge amount of replay value (it's more of a game system in which scenarios are played rather than a single game).  Just be warned, it has a steep learning curve due to complexity.  It's not the most fiddly game out there, for sure, but it leans in that direction.  And be ready to fail; this is a tough game.

Initial Rating: N/A (August 2013)

At last we got to play this, however it wasn’t a good experience. A friend tried to explain the rules, but he didn’t have them clear so it was (kind of) a mess. Right now I can’t give the game a fair rating so I will wait until we play it again.

I read the rules yesterday and now I´m able to explain it.

For now, it seems the game has potential. It doesn’t fix the “dominant player” problem as I have heard, but it does transmit the theme fairly well (although I’m not a fan of this kind of theme). This is one of the few cooperative games that have excited me this year. 

The game art is ok, the icons on the cards are very small for my taste, and the quality of the cards is abysmal for such an expensive game, need to sleeve them ASAP. 

For now I expect to play this next week (before the rules leave my mind).

Initial Rating: 7.0

After another play, I’m beginning to like this game a lot. The rules are somewhat confusing in some parts, but the game is easy to teach and flows quickly. For now I´m giving it a preliminary 7.0 but I will play again this week.

The game can take a while to finish, however you are engaged the whole time so you don’t feel it. It seems the scenarios are hard to beat (I hope this is the case) but I’m not sure about this as I only played the first one. The art is great. Perhaps one of the most complex cooperative games I have played (I love this). It has many interesting options (unlike most CoOP games out there) and the event cards keep the game interesting. In particular I love the way the events now affect our future (poisoning, diarrhea etc.). I´m glad I liked the game as I was losing faith in the Cooperative genre.

It has luck in the form of events and dice, but (most of the time) you can mitigate it with clever play, so in general this doesn’t bothers me. 

For me, this is WAY better than Pandemic, I want to play it again and perhaps I will buy it.

I still consider Robinson Crusoe an impressive design, but for some (irrational) reason I almost never want to play it. Due to this I’m  decreasing its rating.

I’m still excited about the new game that take place in Mars.

After carefully consideration and soul searching, I definitively want to play the game again. These past couple of months I have found myself thinking about the game and I really want to beat it. I sold my old edition of the game and I now regret it, so I already bought the new edition of the game. Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is a good cooperative game and my desire to play the game again is high once more :D.

This is a nearly perfectly executed game.  There's limited "Alpha gamer" problem here because honestly it's difficult for anyone to really know what to do next.

Regardless, this game is always new, the scenarios are excellent, allow for different focuses and playstyles, and scales excellently with the number of players.  Tense, gripping action throughout.

This is a very unique game. It allows so many possibilities in a highly thematic setting for playing a game. Although it offers very few characters, 4 from base, 1 from expansion and 2 more from other sources, it still managed to offer a great gaming experience. I love the theme, the mechanics on how it works, and quality of the production. The only complaints I have would be: poorly written rule book and lack of characters. The rest is simply outstanding. Try it, it's worth it if you like this sort of game, which is moderately complex in my opinion.

Update:[After two games of 2P, and 4 sessions of solo in scenario 1and 2, I can conclude that this game is really a fantastic creation. The theme, the excitement, the tension it build and the dilemma it gave us when making tough decisions, all are excellent quality stuff. Try it at least, you won't regret it!]

This game is the true 'Sandbox' experience that I wanted from the board game. It truly hits all the aspect 1) sense of exploration and adventure, 2) managing resources, 3) building items - all while you are trying to clear scenario's goal.

Each scenario gives vastly different feel to one game from another. There is just so much that comes with the base game that you will never go bored with years down the road. I could be playing a game where I rush to grab woods to make a huge bonfire to send rescue signal, or taking a role of exorcist to discover dark mystery surrounding the cursed island. On top of this, the designer and fans constantly bring their own scenario ideas where you can print and play which is just fantastic. This game will never get old.

The only negative that I have with this game is the production quality on the cards. The game board, dice, wooden tokens, and just about everything else is perfectly fine. But you can definitely tell that they cut the cost down on the cards. These cards have such a terrible finish on them that they get damaged so easily with careless shuffling. Thus, I highly recommend people to sleeve them - they will definitely wear out quickly otherwise.

Also, the game is incredibly hard. It does reward players for taking best possible choices, but sometimes you wonder whatever choice you make, you have a little chance against the game as it feels like much of the game is luck driven with which tile comes up, which event card gets revealed, and so on - not just dice rolling. However, this bothers me much less than other games as I take this game for its thematic values, not strategy. I am stranded on an island, struggling to survive - if it was like spending a week on tropical beach with fruit cocktails, I would have been much disappointed.

This game hit my playing groups sweet spot. We have been yearning for great story driven games that gives you the feeling of a sandbox world where you can do "anything" and your actions have consequences. This game put our dream a notch higher: no downtime between players, there's so much to do so there's no one to say "this is the absolute best solution" do like I say or we're going to die here.

I can't wait to my next set of games - didn't even clean the table from RC for a week :D

First edition: good game! I get swept up in the theme of this one more than any other game! The rule book is terrible and leaves A LOT of questions unanswered. Traded away the first edition because the rules were so terrible. Looking forward to trying out the new rules. 

New Edition: the rules are much much better even if not as thorough as I would prefer (I would appreciate description of every single card, discovery token, etc.). However, after one play, I felt little need to play it again.

RATING: 7
This is a complex, thematic, and highly procedural co-op that is quite punishing to play (both in terms of game play and meeting scenario goals as well as in rule look-ups and set up and break-down). There is a lot to track and keep in mind as you go through the game and the game bafflingly does not come with a good rules summary to help. Personally, I am quite patient with rules-heavy games and don't mind looking up a bunch of stuff during play, but I think I am in the minority on that point. I've played this twice now (scenario 1 & 2) and both times we came away saying:

"I like the idea of this game, but it's a ton of work to play."

"I want to like it more than I do."

"We have other co-ops that are just as much fun that have a A LOT less overhead."

"I don't mind a hard co-op, but in this one I feel like it starts getting hopeless, but not totally, but enough that the last hour feels utterly hopeless. At least with Ghost Stories the inevitable tragic end comes quickly."

These kinds of responses tell me the game is not for my group. This makes me a little sad since I, too, love the concept of the game. I have too many games, though, to hold onto ones like this hoping that attitudes change.

Quite re-playable with a diverse set of scenarios, large decks, multiple characters, and varying degrees of difficulty to make each experience different from the last.

It's a decent game, unique in that it is a survival game. It captures the theme quite well. I like the idea of "foreshadowing" through deck-building: you know ahead of time what bad stuff will happen to you, although I don't think it's worth memorizing them, so it appears random.

The major complaints are the rulebook and the cardboard components, which are so thin and small. These are the small problems that plagued 51st state, this company really needs to fix their product quality.

Oozing with theme, the mechanics of this game literally makes you feel like you are really trapped on an island, desperate to survive.

While luck contributes to a sizeable portion of the gameplay, it felt right in place with the theme - An unknown island where anything can happen, whether it being expected or a surprise.

Tough game that'll beat you down. A win in this game brings so much satisfaction.

This is one of the deeper co-ops that I have played. You are trapped on an island. Gradually you explore the island, gain resources and fight for survival.

I can play with friends and don't fight them, but work together? I can discuss and argue what will be the best for us? There are no "co-op game issues" like the problems with the leader, the problem with "only one right way" or the problem of total stupid randomness of the non-live opponent? And everything set in amazing theme that is put in every detail and corner of the game? And so beautifully illustrated and published with so many decks of cards, pawns, cubes, boards...? Yes, excatly, hats off. Love this one.

Reality is unpredictable...and Robinson Crusoe captures that concept in board game form like no other. Yes, it's tense. Yes, it's tough. But that's what happens when you're deserted on an island. If you want that experience, this is your game. If it's too tough for you, use the official suggestions in the back of the manual of throwing in Friday and the dog. Friday and the dog make the game a little easier, but more importantly they allow you to take a breather every once in a while.

Robinson is a success thematically, has replayability through differentiated scenarios and offers enough interesting decisions to warrant gamers' attention. But it suffers from the same problem of being overloaded with mechanisms as Trewiczek's other games that I have tried so far (Stronghold, Pret-a-Porter). Each turn, players go through administrative motions to simulate the hostile environment on the island and have to cope with the results while ultimately working toward the scenario goal. There are some clever ideas such as the possibility to take benefits from events and in turn shuffle the event into the main draw deck which later will lead to potentially severe negative consequences. In detail though, the system is creaking, e.g. the awkward handling of mandatory events, the repetitive die rolls or the motivation mechanism that feels plugged on.
I would play Robinson again but as far as cooperative games go I rather stay with Pandemic, Space Alert or Arkham Horror. The input-output relation is better on these titles either gameplay wise (Pandemic), funwise (Space Alert) or in immersion (Arkham Horror).

This game beats you up from start to finish. Very thematic and fun to make up stories as you play. Rules aren't the greatest.

5/27/2016: I really enjoy this game. Although there is a lot of ambiguity in the cards and rules, I have found that if you go with the option that makes the most thematic sense, it really enriches the game rather than take away from it. You start to create a dialogue of why you are taking a cube off the board rather than just moving a yellow cube back into the supply pile for example. I would like to see another 5-6 good scenarios created for this. There are some fan made ones that I may need to try.

Gives Arkham Horror a run for it's money in terms of best co-op, however the different scenarios don't play all that differently, and I find each run tends to be played almost the same once you've done it once or twice, in addition, suffers more "alpha gamer syndrome" than many co-ops. Having played more games, I have come to enjoy this one even more, though I still prefer Arkham as my favorite solo experience, this one is a close second.

could not get into theme. It felt too much like worker placement puzzle without much else. Actions seemed quite obvious (yes, it is difficult but somehow I was not feeling like I am making heavy decisions).

I would much rather play game like BSG or DoW where coop is twisted with hidden personalities/goals or something with real-time element.

Pros: 

it does end....eventually... 

Cons: 

1. No robot monkey butlers 
2. The discovery of 'fun' isn't one of the options you can research in the game. 
3. ITS STUPIDLY BORING!!!!!!!!!!! 
4. Perpetuates the idea that boring games are somehow high ranking, courtesy of the folk on BGG..... 
5. There is no doubt that all the people who ranked this a 10 have 'issues' and need to start playing real games to put this in context.

A survival board game. The environment this game creates is brilliant. The island is alive and out to get you. You are puny, weak, just a grain of sand on a beach.... Insignificant... Try not to die. The rules are a little stubborn to remember, but it's worth the experience.

This game is everything I was hoping it would be. The best coop I've played. Very challenging - I have yet to beat the first (and easiest) scenario, but that's what I like, a game that isn't easy to win. Fantastic!

Update: After six plays with the first scenario I finally won! Tough game, almost died, but we lit that bonfire!

One play at a Con, and we didn't quite finish the game. I was impressed with the game design, and the challenge. I'm also quite drawn to the theme (it hits my thematic soft spot). But I don't have a strong attraction to cooperative games. I like them for family games, or with my non-gamer friends, but I'm not as drawn to them as a gamer. This one might change my mind though. More plays needed.

2014-02-13 - 7.5 - Good coop - a little bit too long setup, and not as thrilling as it should be in my opinion. I liked it but I always prefered to play something else. You need to remember about a little bit too many things that are triggered during the game.

2016-02-13 - 7.5->8 - After a long time of not playing Robinson I finally got my own copy. And I must say that there is a lot of adventure in this game. IMO you should know the rules well to fully enjoy the game. There is quite a lot of small rules that you need to remember but it's just worth it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Crisis after crisis, this is a very thematic story-driven cooperative game. Sometimes the luck plays a huge factor and makes impossible to win, regardless of plans. Not a very good solo experience, because this is not a puzzle, it is a pure Ameritrash, you play the odds.
Scenarios Overview: Castways (long and hard), Cursed Island (fast and easy), Jenny (fast and hard, but too much streamlined), Treasure Island (too much dependent on luck)..

One of the rare games I bought before playing it first.  What a great call!  I am in love with this one.  It has a ton of replay value and is just dripping with theme.  I'm sure it isn't for everyone, but this one is for me!  Maybe my favorite game.  :-D  I also pimped out my game, so that just adds a bit more flavor to it all.  I also own all promos and expansions for this one and intend to always get anything available as they are released.  I also got a copy of the 2nd edition rules, which are definitely better.  Oh... and it can also be played solo and is actually good when playing that way.  I am not the biggest solo board gamer, but this one will hit the table when I am feeling the itch to play even if nobody else is available.  Love this game!

This is one hell of a difficult game. You need to do all these things but you have a limited number of people to do them all. You may of course try and do a lot of things but then you roll dice to see if you did it and, let me tell you, if you have no luck in dice you will lose, actually you will lose a lot in this game. But cooperative games MUST be hard. Therefore, if you are looking for an adventure on an unknown island you cannot get better than this game. It is a pure 10!

Egyrészt le a kalappal, hogy ez megjelent magyarul!
Másrészt ez egy fantasztikus játék!
Harmadrészt iszonyatosan nehéz minden szabályt betartva játszani. Nem azért, mert nem akarja az ember, hanem azért, mert a legnagyobb körültekintés mellett is jó eséllyel becsúszik valami félreértelmezés, figyelmetlenség.
Negyedrészt  annyira kooperatív, hogy már majdnem egyfős játékról beszélhetünk. Persze, meg kell mindent beszélni, együtt kell dönteni, de senkinek sem saját köre, sem saját titkos kártyája nincsen. Egyfelől jó lehet, hiszen könnyebben megy az egész, másfelől viszont az alfajátékos szempontjából ennél veszélyesebb helyzet nincs.
Csak akkor tudom jó szívvel ajánlani, ha valaki úgy gondolja, hogy a téma, a játékélmény minden szívást elfeledtet.

I had some fun with this, and I can see that the different scenarios would add some variety to the proceedings.  But for me, cooperative games just don't soar that high.  I don't really enjoy the "us vs. the system" mode of gaming.

Handsome game, and assuming you like co-ops, I can imagine it would be a nice game for you.  But for me, I'd prefer to play something else.  Not horrid, and I'd play occasionally if asked.

Only played twice, once through each of the first two scenarios with the wife.  We won both, which seems odd, comparing to others' reviews, but I've scoured the rules and I think we're doing it all right.  The first scenario was pretty fun and very thematic.  It seemed we were doing very well, then the later rounds (months) hit along with worse weather and wiped out our resource stores - we barely were able to get the needed wood before the final round to start the bonfire before the boat left range.  The tension built well right up to the end. The second scenario seemed much less tangible and weakly themed.  I can't wait to get more than two of us playing and to try some of the later, more elaborate scenarios.

With two rounds under my belt, "Robinson Crusoe" currently stands as one of the most enjoyable games I've played in 2013.  

Designer Ignacy Trzewiczek, is always trying to tell a story with his titles and this one comes through in spades.  Solid euro mechanisms are given a dose of theme and chaos from dice and event cards.  You may not always be able to mitigate every bit of luck, but you'll certainly have fun and be left with an interesting tale to tell.

I Very like this game, but I would not want to play it all the time. Game is hard to win. It's fine that you have to be prepared for everything, but you can plan every action, and event card can ruin this.  Game can discourage to play anothe one game. 

On the other side, there is nice balance, some mechanics to make game little easier. Mechanics are very interesting, and winning the play gives you big satisfaction.

Nice for 2 players.

Bardzo lubię tę grę, ale potrafi swoją trudnością zniechęcić i nie zawsze chcę ją wyciągać na stół. Gra jest trudna do wygrania scenariusza. Mogą wystąpić sytuacje, że jesteś gotowy na niemal wszystko, a wydarzenie zrujnuje Twoje plany, ale HEJ! w końcu jesteśmy na bezludnej/nawiedzonej/pełnej kanibali itp. wyspie, nikt nie mówił, że będzie prosto. Mechanicznie, jest świetna, choć o kilku drobnych rzeczach trzeba pamiętać i warto mieć w pogotowiu instrukcję. Trudność gry można zmodyfikować pewnymi mechanikami (Pies, Piętaszek) Satysfakcja z wygranej jest ogromna, zwłaszcza, jeśli od przegranej dzieli nas jedna rana. Gra z czasem zyskuje w naszej planszówkowej ekipie. Bardzo przyjemnie gra się zarówno we dwójkę jak i pełen komplet czterech graczy. Posiada też tryb solo, którego osobiście, (samego trybu, a nie w tej grze) nie jestem największym fanem, ale spróbowałem i da się :-) Bardzo polecam, ale dla graczy, którzy już w coś pograli i nie zniechęcą się kilkoma porażkami pod rząd.

2013-Aug-20: Played three times so far. Won 2 solo games, lost one co-op (mainly because I suck at explaining such a complex game). 

2013-Aug-15: Received a couple of days ago and after a quick run to sleeve all the cards, it was finally ready to hit the table for a solo playthrough. Lots of fun, I find it brings out a lot of AP for me (mostly because I'm learning what I can and shouldn't do). Seems to have a lot of replayability. Production quality is inconsistent - flimsy, easily scuffed cards, gorgeous tiles and board. Will rate after a game with my husband and normal gaming partner.

04-08-2014 - I like it.  P doesn't so much.  Her dislike rubs off on me on this one and I don't like it as much as I probably would if she liked it more.  I'm not sure why this game is like that, I guess everyone playing really needs to be into it.  It's also HARD and can start feeling really hopeless, but not in a fun way like in Arkham.  I've played twice and lost my butt hard in both games, though I think I'm starting to come up with some more strategic ideas.  Hope to play again, hopefully many times.  I wish it hit me like a ton of fun-bricks like the hype would suggest it would, but so far it's not a really the winner winner chicken dinner I hoped it would be.  Perhaps with more eagerly anticipated plays (I just want to DO WELL at this point!).

Amazing game. Theme and story development is among the elite for any game I've ever played.  Extremely challenging! During our game, we never felt like we were just playing against the game.  We actually developed light personal attachments to our characters and really wanted to survive the brutal challenges that the world threw our way.  *Requires* teamwork, but there's plenty of room to briefly "do your own thing" if you simply don't agree with the rest of the group.  Be warned, however, that cooperation is a must just to be able to survive to the next day.  We completed the Cursed Island scenario on the 10th (and final) day and clawed our way back from what looked to be certain defeat at least twice (including at the end of day 8 due to extremely severe storms combined with a significant lack of supplies).  Awesome!

Yet another cooperative game, with a very high ameritrash influence. There is lots of great adventure atmosphere and even more luck factor. Unfortunately, cooperative games are not for me.

I am not a big fan of worker placement. But in this game there is the perfect balance between luck and strategy. The theme is built in the game mechanics in such a way that it generates a story based on your decisions. There are a lot of expansions and scenarios. But it s a hard game. It shines as a solitaire game.

Before this board game, I wouldn't have imagined that I would ever play a board game only by myself. Now I have played Robinson Crusoe solo 7 times and it's still exciting to play. I usually don't like randomness in games but it fits the theme quite well and triggers a lot of emotions. Also, I love the whole look of this game!

I don't really enjoy the long setup time and the rules were really difficult to learn. The latter is also one of the reasons why I mostly play it solo (but I'm not a big fan of cooperative play anyway).

RATING: 9.5
Have only played 2 of the scenarios in solo mode, but man what an experience.  By far, I think this is the most cohesive looking board game.  The artwork and design on the board and the cards really gives that added sense that you are on an island.  Based on theme alone, the game is top notch.

Though it is a coop game, I like the caveat that all the decision making is simultaneous.  Though there are some decisions that may be better than others, it doesn't feel "scripted" as any choice may still require the roll of the dice.  So what may seem like a very good decision at that time may totally screw you over after the dice has been rolled.

Learning the game was a chore though as the rulebook is not succinctly designed for easy learning and to recheck rule specifications.  Having player aids and the FAQ at hand is a must for me when playing the game.  The game can be fiddly but am willing to look past that for it's great gameplay.

Great game....have only played a 2 player game (unfortunately couldn't finish) and one solo (I died in round 8)...but this has a lot of depth....

Edit: I have played the game now several times (2 player) and it still shines; very tight game with a wonderfully thematic feel. 

Beaten scenario 1 once now and I'm very curious to see what the next "trips" will bring...

Great art.  Great theme.  The game is just too damned difficult and the rules have too much ambiguity.  There are situations where you have to make up rules as you go along and this makes the sheer quantity of rules it already has feel less meaningful.

If you're new to the game go to the back of the rulebook and apply ALL of the recommendations that make the game easier.  The difficulty is just BRUTAL and can feel like a time waste sometimes.

My advice if you're looking for a co-op board game that's moderately rules heavy:  skip this game and maybe get Eldritch Horror instead.  It has a clearer theme, stronger rule set, and even though it's difficult the gameplay feels a little more meangingful.

Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is an epic game from Portal. You will build a shelter, palisade, weapons, you will create tools like axes, knives, sacks, you will do everything you can to… to survive. You will have to find food, fight wild beasts, protect yourself from weather changes…

Trzewiczek takes the players to a deserted island, where they'll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They'll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find and much more awaits them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and – after several in-game weeks of hard work – how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game...

[b]Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island[/b] is a highly thematic game for 1-4 players, which scales really well with any number of players. The replay value is very high: 6 different scenarios, 4 different characters with 4 unique abilities each and a [i]huge[/i] amount of different cards which would only be available in other games by buying at least one expansion. The components are fantastic: the overall quality is great (thick cardboard tokens, custom dice), the artworks are gorgeous (minimalistic scribbly journal style) and the game is full of nice little details like double-sided character sheets for both genders. The game board deserves special praise, as it is not just beautifully illustrated, but it also has one of [b][i]the[/i][/b] best layouts, making it readable like a text page (left/right, up/down) and guide you through the game's different phases - it is effectively one giant and interactive player aid.

The theme is very strong in this game, as it puts a lot of constant pressure on the players in their struggle for survival. This richness of theme comes at the price of complexity though: the rulebook is relatively long and full of small rule details and exceptions. You can read the rulebook several times and still discover some new details you overlooked or simply forgot in previous games. If you are interested in this game, don't expect to play it the next day after you bough it, as you [b][i]really[/i][/b] need to do your homework on this game.
Thanks to the strong integration of theme, most rules will make sense and are theoretically easy to remember -- but there are just too many of them. So if you are the kind of player who always needs to play 100% by the rules: don't play this game, it won't happen. To be honest, I really doubt that anybody [i]ever[/i] played this game 100% correctly by the rules. There is just too much to keep track of and the fact that the game is actually a bit fiddly and full of moving parts does not help in that regard.

It is a flawed game.

From all the cooperative games I have played, [b]Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island[/b] is most prone to the Alpha Gamer problem (one player taking control over the group, telling everybody what to do), as all items are stored in one common group inventory and always available to everyone. The action/planning phase (the main part of the game) is also always discussed and executed as a group. There are effectively no individual player turns in this main part of the game, as the planning has to happen simultanously because players are often relying on each other's direct support. The only thing which gives your character a unique feeling are the character sheets featuring unique health tracks and abilities.

Cooperative games need to be really challenging, or they are uninteresting to play. [b]Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island[/b] certainly is very difficult to win, but its difficulty comes from the wrong angle: the game is overall very swingy and players most of the time just stumble through the unknown while hoping for the best. This is maybe ok if you and your group are playing a scenario for the first time together, but if someone is new to a specific scenario while the rest of the group has already played it before, the newcomer will have no clue what is important in order to win, further enhancing the Alpha Gamer problem. The first time you play a new scenario, it will just be trial and error, which can be very frustrating to players.

Coming back to the previously mentioned swingyness/luck dependency: the game plays and feels very modular, full of possibilities and things to discover, which is actually a very good thing, but it's a game of extremes, as players will either do very well or fail miserably (often in catastrophic chain reactions). Dice are involved in this game and yes, they can indeed be avoided to some degree, but the game forces the players to push their luck for saving precious turns, which leads us to the game's "Adventure Cards". The first problem with those cards is, that their name is misleading: they should honestly be called "Disaster Cards", as players want to avoid drawing one of these cards at all costs, simply because most of them are really, really bad. The concept behind those cards and how they are thematically integrated is actually a big highlight of this game, but they sadly just don't work as "adventures". It's great that they sometimes offer decisions between option A and B, but this again boils down to the decision if you want to push your luck even further and just delay something which might happen on a future turn and hit your group unexpectedly and hard -- and it is absolutely possible to instantly lose the game by some desastrous chain reaction of bad events.

Another very swingy part of this game is the way the game handles hunting: you draw a random card, and the animal can be something dangerous between a flock of parrots (strength: 1) or a tiger (strength: 6) - and you just have to go through this encounter no matter what, meaning: there is no option to flee for you or the animal (which still surprises me, considering how thematic the rest of the game is).
If a player are not adequately prepared, a character can suffer severe damage and maybe even get killed, which immidiately ends the entire game for everyone. Players can indeed invest a lot of precious time and resources in preparation, but there is still the chance that it will turn out that you overdid it and wasted time and resources which could have been used somewhere else.

[b]Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island[/b] is arguably more of an "experience" and less of a "game" because of its unpredictability. It's complex and swingy but at the same time exciting and thematic. You will want to try out a new scenario and yes, you will fail horribly at first and be frustrated. You will want to draw a risky "adventure" card although you absolutely know you should not peek around that corner.

Personally, the positive aspects outweight the negatives ones for me, but I cannot blame anyone if he/she sees this balance differently, rating this game lower than I do. I am actually pretty sure that my own rating for this game might decrease over time in the future.
It's without question a flawed game, it's not for everyone and it certainly is not a game I would be willing to play every day, as it can be a really frustrating experience. Still, if I am in the right mood for a very thematic and challenging cooperative game which defines the struggle for survival by relying on a good amount of luck, then I will indeed enjoy my visit on the Cursed Island. And you will indeed curse a lot on and about this island...

It's dripping with theme and it's hard but so much fun. Definitely on of the best games in my collection but the crippled manual makes it nearly unplayed in the last months. It's kinda hard to get into it after not playing it for a long time. The rules are convoluted and don't explain everything properly. Nevertheless I don't want to trade it. Maybe the right time will come to play the rest of the scenarios.

If you can wait for the Zman version, I would encourage you to do so.  The English in the Portal edition leaves quite a bit to be desired and the organization of the rules also leave a few questions.  Also, the components in the game manifest and rule set do not always match in shape or color what is shown which can be annoying.  There is a very helpful FAQ in the files section on BGG that I would highly recommend if you do purchase the Portal version.

However, the game is quite a bit of fun and quite thematic.  One does get into the narrative and the experience and there can be arguments over who does what and what we need to pursue to survive the best.  My favorite aspect of the game is your choice to either place two workers on a space to take the action safely or only place one and roll three dice to find out if you did complete the action, if another event card occurs, and if you have to take a wound or not...The different inventions add a bit of flavor to the game and outside of the basic nine, these can be different from game to game.  Also interesting is how those event cards can cycle back through with some resulting from the action that occurred when the card was drawn (IE, took a spider bite when the card was drawn? - then when it comes up again in the event phase, you will likely suffer an infection and gain a wound.)

Does this fix the alpha player issue?  No, the alpha player can still drive the game.

Rating after one play, 2player, 1st scenario: One of the thematically most involved co-operative games I've played so far, with some very interesting and innovative new mechanisms! The first scenario did not feel very strategically demanding, but it was a lot of story all over it.

On the downside: The german rulebook is badly written with some key concepts being explained in a rather ambigious way - I had to read the english rules to be able to play the game correctly.

Hard and unforgiving game. Fun and frustration at the same time. What I don't like about it, is the fact that you have to be clever, make well thought moves, plan ahead and still additionally need luck to win. This may vary depending on scenario or playercount but there are situations where you just can't win, if you have bad luck with the first two eventcards, no matter what you do. This is the reason why I do not rate the game higher and why I think that it gets too much love in general and is too high in rankings.
Altough it is a clever and interesting game!

* Component (ZMan)

Tokens easy to punch, well centered, thick enough.

Nice mounted map, good quality.

Cards of OK quality: a couple creased at the edge (transport?), with white creases (on black!).

Box only a little too big. Very sturdy (like Manoeuvre or Commands and Colors: Ancients).

* Rules

Quite streamlined (but not perfectly so: must consume 1 Food during the night phase, but get 2 wounds instead of the usual 1 wound for each unfulfilled demand).

Mostly make sense thematically (BUT: for Winter clouds, the cold weather forces you to "heat the camp" (rules) by burning wood… even if you don't have invented Fire–which is nonetheless necessary for some actions, as if you couldn't use your camp's fire.).

Quite a few holes and non-mentioned exceptions in the rules, but well covered by the FAQ (example: in scenario 1, the Mast's wood must be used right away, instead of being available at the end of the Action phase as usual with an invention).

The rules have actually the largest number of holes and rules that don't make full sense thematically that I have ever met (in about 150 games). This does not prevent me from enjoying the game, but it can slow down a game in a slightly unpleasant way. A solution is to house rule while playing, based on what makes sense thematically (this is satisfying, and does not give the impression that one is cheating), and then check later.

Furthermore, many "official" rules exist, it is not always easy to know which one prevails.

The designer, despite all his good intentions, is not present enough online to answer the many rules questions that open up.

The rules were obviously not tested on a scale large enough to prevent many difficult rule questions to be opened and discussed—in my 100+ games, I have never seen so many rule problems. The rule questions do not prevent from playing the game. They just give me a bitter taste when the game has to be slowed down when a rule question pops up during play: it is always hard to know if there is simply a hole in the rules that can be house-ruled without too much consequence, or if one is missing some important rule information that the designer really wanted in the game.

* Setup

The setup involves many components, but they are easy to place, thanks to the theme and the absence of any "counting": we just put the components where they logically belong.

* Game play

The situation does not evolve linearly, contrary to many games: the players can go through ups and downs that are all different. Example, first scenario: a wreck, but some easy wood gathering around natural shelters in the mountain, but then many nights  in the cold  hungry, only to hope to be able one day to have a nice, comfortable base for wood and food gathering. Which happens. But then you are exhausted by all the hardship and start losing hope, and stop taking care of yourself, and die. I like the kind of emotions and the variety that lie behind this.

The game can be paused easily anytime, and in particular at the end of a round. With about 12 rounds in +2 hours, each round is about 10+ minutes: the game can be played for a flexible number of rounds and picked back up later (if the game can be left on the table). Very useful for taking breaks (solo, in a pair,…); similar to watching yet another episode of a series. Very convenient.

I can't really see a dominant player deciding for the others so easily: the variety of situations (inventions, events, adventures,…) makes it harder to know immediately what is best to do. Furthermore, the fact that some needs are really pressing means that the strategy is dictated in large part by the situation more than by the players (there is still room for clever advance planning, for getting ready for possible upcoming difficulties).

Having no player turns is great: players can all discuss together and be involved in the same way in the game: they all have the privilege of being able to take actions/play. Better than anxiously waiting for your turn so that you can contribute, or than trying to suggest to other what they should play, robbing them in part of their turn.

The event (and adventure events) that take place each round give way more flavor and theme to the table than the corresponding event cards in another cooperative game like Pandemic. Robinson is way above Pandemic in terms of  flavor and variety.

The fact that it can be played solo is great for fulfilling any desire to play it. You still get the story, the adventure.

* Feeling

When I'm thinking of it, Robinson is a game where, in order to win, players have to manage resources (Food, Wood, Weapons, Shelter, Roof, Palissade), build Items that help getting these resources, in an environment with random events that regularly change the details of the needs in resources. This is, to me a management game, with some uncertainty handling. However, there is no victory point accumulation, just a sudden defeat that the players must avoid. Also, the theme is very strong, rich and very well integrated with the mechanics. All in all, in terms of gameplay, Robinson remains a resource management game (that feels like a constant Harvest phase in Agricola, where the whole game *is* meeting the needs of your people): the goal is to be in a position to get as much as possible of needed resources—with the planning and resource counting that goes with it. But a beautiful management game at that: each game has drama and depicts a story. This is very different from, say, a wargame, an abstract, or a party game.

In other words, calculating resource needs and generation capacity, planning, counting resources, handling a bit of uncertainty is what you *do*, it's the task you must succeed at. The story is what you *enjoy*. This is different, for example, from a role playing game (where creating a good story is what you *do*, it's your task), but also different from a game like chess (where you try to get to good positions), etc. Fundamentally, the *task* that Robinson gives you is resource management. This is how you win.

I have so many good memories of my adventures on the island! This is different from many other games that also I like very much: I am attached to the *scenarios*, to the stories, because they had a marked flavor, because I did use my imagination more than in many other games. This feeling is precious. I get a similar feeling with games with scenarios with a strong flavor, like Earth Reborn, Claustrophobia, and (to a lesser extent, because the flavor is often similar) Space Hulk. Maybe Duel of Ages II will be like this to, thanks to the special characters and the funny situations in which they can find themselves. Some rare games of Magic: the Gathering are like this too, where some striking even happens (like Angel of Salvation saving a game, like Augustin VI (?) really bothering me for the whole game and naturally leading to my defeat,…).

I've only played this game solo, which is very suitable to the theme of the game. It's very thematic and tells a story as you play. Can be quite difficult, but that makes it more rewarding when you overcome the hardships placed in front of you. 
Quite enjoyable to play. And I really like how much free extra content the developer made for the game. This is a game that I may rate higher once I play more scenarios.

I've been on a tear about ccoperative games lately. They don't get much play action in either of my groups, and that bugs me, as there are a few I like. When Robinson Crusoe was suggested by a friend, I jumped at the chance, as I was getting to play a coop I'd heard good things about by a designer I really like. 

I was not disappointed, either. It's a tough game, but it sticks brutally close to its theme (with a few exceptions -- why doesn't fur help against cold? I'd like to tear down the palisade for wood, etc.) We had four nearly-new players (one had played before), so there was no alpha player problem. On the contrary, each round the planning was more like, "Hey, I can do some hunting, so that will take care of food." or "I think you've got wood covered, so I'll raise our morale and prevent this disaster." The game had its ups and downs; at one point all seemed lost and then we bounced back, only to get wiped out again. The weather dice are brutal, almost too much so. We were apparently shipwrecked in Alaska, and that was our undoing. 

It was a lot of fun and a great game. But, sadly, another game that won't get played because, "what's the point if I can't win?"

Engrossing theme, Lived up to its reputation of being hard.  My first solo play I lost half way through, my second I barely won.  Want to try with more and want to more scenarios.  Looks like lots of replayability.  The rule book's pretty rough, but I think teaching it wouldn't be that bad.  There's a lot to keep track of and PuntheHun's player aid is a must have to guide you through the steps of the game.

Best comparison for me is Dead of Winter, even though this is a true co-op.  All the cards that tell the story and dripping theme.  I prefer DoW, for the traitor aspect/unique player goals, and they way that mitigates the Alpha player problem.  Both are excellent though.

El juego me ha encantado por su rejugabilidad (tiene muchas cartas de Evento, Aventura y objetos)y exigencia, pues te hace tener la cabeza en varias cosas a la vez,  obligándote a priorizar y elegir la opción no más buena, sino la menos mala, pues la mayoría de vicisitudes que ocurren son o malas o peores.Esto puede provocar cierto análisis-parálisis, sobretodo en las primeras partidas cuando no se conoce del todo la mecánica del juego. La tematización del juego es fantástica, te hace sentir realmente que estás perdido en una isla.
Juego difícil que promete horas de diversión, con el toque suficiente de aleatoriedad debido al lanzamiento de dados que le da más emoción al juego.

RATING: 5
Note that these comments are based on the edition I played, which I am given to understand is the original printing, and not the more recent broadly released version.

If you're looking for an innovative co-op game, this is excellent. 

While it's convoluted and complex (qualities I admire in competitive games), it's not something I can say I'll be clamouring for. 

I liked the game, I had a lot of fun, but I prefer games that are not co-operative.

情境帶入感佳，透過隨機組合的事件卡與骰子點數，營造出各種困擾玩家的挑戰，充分展現出孤島求生的掙扎。如果想要體驗時時命在旦夕的生存冒險，或者喜歡挑戰自己危機處理、即時決策能力的玩家，應該能充分享受到這款遊戲的醍醐味。雖然是1－4人的遊戲，但1個人跑也很有樂趣。

與其他合作類遊戲一樣，遊戲中仍舊難以避免容易淪為一人主導全局的問題。但我想這種問題在現實生活中也同樣容易出現，應該是很反映現實的人類行為問題。無法完全怪罪在遊戲身上。

p.s.與農家樂一起入手的第一款桌遊。

This is an excellent game. A lot of theme and each scenario is replayable multiple time. Love it at 2 player. The game is very difficult but satisfying.

RATING: 8
This is a pretty thematic risk management game, as almost anything can be performed or mitigated for sure, you'll just have to pay through the nose in actions to do so. I like that this game still has a decent amount of variety and theme without having to sacrifice strategic planning. This game besides the different themes gives a similar feel as Ghost Stories for me, despite the different mechanisms: both are variable puzzles whereas you need to balance risk with possible mega turns. However, in Ghost Stories you can be screwed over completely by one or two bad die rolls despite the strategy, whereas in Robinson I feel like you would have to get really unlucky to be completely screwed by the dice. In both games the individual character powers feel fairly different from one another.

There are a lot of tech options but I do not think they are a source of information overload, as usually you unlock a few at a time as you discover new terrain.

My cons of this game are 1. the rulebook leaves ambiguities in a lot of places and 2. there is a decent amount of upkeep to keep track of (each step is fairly quick so it doesn't bog the game down, but there are definitely moments where you might forget to complete one of the steps).

EDIT after buying the 2nd edition: Rulebook is clearer now but seems overly wordy and some sections aren't where I would logically put them. Still have only played the 1st scenario.  I prefer how in Ghost Stories the ghosts are very in your face, whereas this one it feels more like a race in that e.g. you need to get a roof up before the bad weather kicks in, or fulfill the objective before time runs out. There is tension because it always feels like there are a lot you want to do but don't have enough actions for, but it isn't as much as watching your board get overrun by ghosts. I have been playing things relatively safe in avoiding drawing adventure cards as some of them seem horrible, which has reduced the variability of a given scenario. Hopefully there is more incentive to take more risks once in a while in future scenarios so I can draw these cards.

In terms of solo play, the dog only being able to perform very limited actions and not being able to do so by itself makes the solo action selection a little bit awkward, especially since it isn't as rewarding to spend actions to boost morale in solo. It still is fun to play solo, but I feel like certain scenarios might strongly favor one character over another (not necessarily a bad thing).

EDIT 2: This feels like a very unpolished game, with whole decks and actions almost never being utilized in certain scenarios, making it rather unwieldy, along with wild swings in difficulty depending on a couple chance cards, chance cards that are too uncommon and unique for you to actually prepare for. I also haven't had a huge desire to replay each scenario more than a few times, as my approach to each doesn't change that much (luckily, there is some good fan content out there to maintain replayability). Unfortunately, no other game gives the thematic trapped on the island feel while have the strategic layer of a euro, so for now it will remain highly rated by me.

Chrono mentioned he had Robinson Crusoe, and I got really excited. I math traded into it finally at Origins, and I hadn't gotten the chance to play it yet. Chrono was describing the scenarios, and Beren and I were immediately like "CANNIBALS!" Turns out that it probably wasn't a good choice for a starter scenario... We got wrecked by the Cannibals.

But we decided to try again. We successfully rescued Jenny. I really, really liked this game and can't wait to try some of the harder rules in solo play (or with local people) soon! This is one of my favorite ways to utilize dice in a game.

Compared to Eldritch Horror, where even in case of bad luck you seem progressing or struggling against the game, this game throws so much bad stuff at you that you always feel brought back to the starting point.

A beautifully produced and original game that blends worker-placement with other elements in  such a way as to avoid the sort of grinding sense of themelessness one often experiences with other recent Euros that employ that increasingly overused mechanic. 

The rulebook is exhaustive but not especially smooth reading, which can make the game look painfully fiddly at first, but playing through a few turns is enough to give one a solid feel for how intuitively everything fits together. The one thing it took me a while to get used to was planning around the contingencies introduced on each Scenario card; studying these things in advance is VERY important. But the variability of scenarios adds enormously to the game's replayability. 

The way the scenarios work actually also place places it in an interesting and perhaps unique niche withing the history of the hobby, as gamers start to become disenchanted with WP-based Euros and correspondingly obsessed with the legacy mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This one is really good, which surprised me a bit as I'm not a fan of the genre. After I play more scenarios I might change the score, but probably up to 9 and not the other way around :) Very thematic, quite simple once we get a hang of it, and actually quite fast-playing for such game. Good as a solitaire game (which also surprised me :P).

after first game (playing castaway scenario - 3 player)  :
great coop game
this game is not easy ,,, 
decisions is so important that after 3-4 round you begin to know your mistakes on early rounds.
learning process is hard but playing is easy ,,, and game itself has no mercy.
rule book a little complicated so for learning you need to watch tutorial videos .

so much theme is in this game as if you really in wild island ...
we enjoyed so much as i looking to gather my group again for another session to escape this wild island  :D

-------------- 
update 1 : 
after playing 4 games .
my group dont like this kind of games ...
i dont know the problem 
but this game doesnt have the magic to force itself to  our table 
so for lack of magic power i downgrade the rating from my previous 9 to 7.9

The popularity of this game is inexplicable to me.

There is no cooperation needed, as there is no personal ownership of anything, or personal agency.  There is simply no reason for more than one person to play this game. 

I can play solitaire by myself, or I can play it where you and I take turns flipping the top card of the deck. This does not make solitaire a cooperative game.

I think this game tells a fantastic story and gives you a nice brain burn.  You often don't have enough time so you have to use your actions efficiently.

I also own the Beach Cards, Beast Cards, Trait Cards 1, Sailor Character, Spyglass, King Kong Scenario and Dr. Livingston Scenario. I've used most of these and they all add nice little additions to the game.

First impression after two matches with some mistakes in the understanding of the rules and one solo play.  Yes, the game is fiddly.  Yes, the game is hard.  Yes, the rules are poorly laid out, take time to explain, and are hard to fully remember.  However, the game oozes theme.  The castaway theme shines through, and I can tell that the designer likes roleplaying and storytelling.  because the game makes the roleplaying and immersion shine through.  The discussions after the end of the failed adventure are the sign of a good game that deserves multiple plays, definitely good co-op storytelling game.

I thought Castaways was neat until I played this. RC is a much better game. I may have to say that Castaways has been fired. RC scales exceptionally well with any number of players, production quality is very good, the rules are well written, it is easy to teach, it is easy to learn, and the decisions you make have meaning and are interesting. Lastly, the story aspect is there. It is integrated into the game and isn't excessively long like it is in Castaways (where other players might wait up to 15 minutes for you to finish your expedition).

Absolute gem of an adventure game!  Excellent mix of decision making and randomness make for a great play every time. The event decks are terrific, ensuring decisions you make while performing actions have lasting, thematic repercussions. The game's mechanics are very flexible and support a multitude of varied scenarios that play out differently every time. 

I have the Portal 2ed, which I'm told fixes and improves many aspects of previous editions.  The production quality is top notch, the rule book is easy to follow and descriptive, and the player aid makes turns go quickly. 

This is a go-to game for anyone yearning for adventure.

Sehr fesselnd, die Bedohung für die Charakter ist in jeder Situation gut spürbar. Auch die Notwendigkeit, dass sich jeder einbringt extrem gut getroffen. Spiel ist fordernd. Die Kommunikation der Gruppe findet ununterbrochen statt. Leider schwer für neu Einsteiger daher können Spielleiter und Erfahrene durchaus die Einsteiger lenken.

This is one of the most (if not THE most) solid cooperative games I have ever played. It takes the coops to a new, higher level of complexity and difficulty.
Ghost Stories is also very hard, but this game is also complex and full of options.

This is a must play. I recommend it to every gamer who would like to play a complex coop. :)

"Robinson Crusoe" is an excellent game BUT it suffers from some bad design decisions that lead to excessive randomness. Winning or loosing the game it's not a matter of experience but it depends almost totally on luck, which is, to be honest, irritating. 

Nevertheless, its theme realy shines through gameplay and you have the feeling of an adventure. Additionally, the game has the designer's and fans' support (new scenarios! yeah!), which is always a great thing! 

So, in conclusion, if you are a fan of cooperative games and you can ignore the luck-factor, then RC is a must have. 

PS: Once again, not a very good rulebook, but this is not a big deal.

I really love this game! It offers so much theme, you easily could get lost (where are you, Wilson! )

Difficulty-wise, it´s quite a challenge. It may turn off impatient gamers looking for a quick success. Indeed, you will have to try hard to win any scenario, and you will lose more often than you win. You have to be lucky sometimes, either. But the experience is quite rewarding and I recommend this game wholeheartedly.

The rules should have been more concise, at least concerning the german version of the Portal Publishing Version, so you should pick up this game for the second edition.

For me this is very much a role-playing game turned into a board game, which means one thing - the players you are playign with determine its enjoyability.  Almost every game is made better or worse by its players, but this game more so than most.  It is tense, seemingly realistic (as best it can be) and if one really played-up the role playign aspect, I could see it really beign enjoyable.

Sadly, my group, although D&D role-players, couldn't seem to get into it.  I suspect I wouldn't enjoy role-playing with them anyway.

P.S. Not referring to everyone, just a select few who could ruin it for everyone.

I can see that this  is a good game,but like Mage knight the rules are too dense and complicated.Very easy to miss things and play wrongly.Also the scenarios are crazily tough and luck plays too much a part in your ultimate destiny.In other words you can make the right decisions then get wiped out on a couple of unlucky dice rolls.I like luck in games but it plays too big a part here I think.

Though I like this a great deal as a solo game, I have not had a great deal of luck with teaching it to a group.  There are many rules and the rule book is not very good.  Once you get past the barrier of learning the game, I think it would be even better as a multi player game than it is as a solo.  However, I have not found others willing to play it.

(10/17) Drop to 5.  Perhaps I need to play this again or perhaps I'm moving a little away from coop's as a whole, but I don't often feel like devoting the time to this one that it requires.  Still, would definitely give it another shot.

I love this game, played it over two dozen times now, including games of all player counts.  I love the theme and the way that the designer matched the mechanisms.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is not for everyone, but I love it. The game comes with a number of different scenarios with different goals, but the heart of each one is to accomplish something while trying to survive and explore a punishing desert island. The game is VERY hard - if you are of the mindset that you must win to have had fun, you will hate this game. However, if you come at the game as an experience wherein you get to try and overcome insurmountable odds, hunt exotic creatures, go on adventures, and most likely die trying, and that sounds fun to you, then you will likely love this game.

One thing I will add - this game plays 1 - 4 players. I've found it great as a 1 player game with Friday and the dog to help you. Maybe it was just my friends, but 2+ players was a bit of a miserable experience. Choosing what we were going to do took forever, the game has tons of options (which is a good thing!) but leads to strong disagreements if strong personalities are involved. Not simple stuff like Pandemic "Jakarta is going to blow up," "But we're so close to curing red!" stuff. Fundamental stuff like "We need food to not die" "But we need wood to win the game!" "But we need to explore or we'll never get the tools we need". This can cause multiplayer games to turn into 4+ hours of frustration as no-one can possibly do everything they think is important, and the game constantly shows up every round to slap you around.

This game was on my "wishlist" for a while. I knew it was a meaty game with great potential and reportedly infinite replay-ability, but I just couldn't pull the trigger. I already had some heavy/longish games that almost never get played, and I didn't want to add it, play it once and then store it with the others. Luckily, that was not the case--far from it. Instead, in the matter of a week, I've already broken this game out twice and I'm ready to play it again. Taking a look at the pros and cons:

The good:
-Immersive and thematic
-Addictive 
-Excellent components 
-Replay value
-Fun! 

The bad:
-Long--2-3 hours, depending on player count
-Relatively high learning curve
-Although thematic, the rulebook is rather lengthy. Be fully prepared to nurse the rule book for the first few plays. There are several rule exceptions and specific character/action rules that are difficult to remember at first, not to mention several different scenarios.

Update 8/11/14:

This game is simply too complex. I played another solo game today (third game total). I spent 50-60% of the game time looking up rules. Mind you, I remembered the rules fairly well, and have seen it played within the last week. It just seems like it's a little too heavy for its own good. Things began to fall apart quickly, but oddly, the tension didn't seem to increase as the became more difficult. I'm really struggling with my rating here. I like the game, but I seem to like it considerably less after playing it a third time. There's just a lot of pieces, time and effort put into a game that I could care less, once the halfway mark hit, whether I won or lost. I hope to get this back to the table soon, and I think I'll try another scenario to shake things up a bit. 

Update 2/24/17: 

It's amazing how a refreshed rulebook and a "Watch it Played" tutorial can transform a game from a messy clunker with a cool theme to one of my favorite board games of all-time. Congratulations, Ignacy! This game is finally coming to fruition! I seriously don't know if I've ever had so much fun playing a strategy-based board game.

Walks a wonderful line between strategy and chaos, keeping the players in control but constantly needling them with unpredictability.

UNIQUE: I especially like how your actions might have consequences later in the game. Even the way you change the difficulty is clever (you get a dog that can help you explore or hunt). 

NEGATIVES: the game can be a bit too brutal at times.

Played 1st ed twice. More thematic than many other co-op games. It has less of that just-match-the-number -of-symbols feeling that is common in games like Shadowrun Crossfire. With more than two players it may be a little difficult to overview what´s going on and what you need to achieve. Perhaps multiple copies of the scenario cards would help?

The number of scenarios makes this an amazing value.  Like Tom Vassel said, the 1st scenario could've been the entire game!  Mechanics are interesting and there's always tension as players constantly struggle.  It makes victories that much more gratifying.

Update 5/6/16.  Rating decreased from 8.5 to 7.  I still love this game every once in a while, but I don't have the same drive to play it.  As we play more medium/heavy euro's, I'm beginning to like "Roll for success" dice less and less.

This is an excellent, truly cooperative game. The rules are a mess, both in the book and on the scenario boards, which certainly makes it harder to play. In the second scenario the Fog mechanism is particularly confusing. 

The only downside to the game IMO is the way that the ending is usually somewhat anticlimactic. I guess that it's a result of the game being a Euro in nature (despite the dice and cards), the end goals themselves are achieved in a more Euro manner. It's odd, because the games plays out very thematically with each event being full of tension and story, but the game itself can end with a "oh, we won". 

Despite this slight failing, it's one of my favourite games at the moment.

Co-op games often fall prey to alpha gamer problem. This game seemed to have the opposite problem where it was too complicated for some players to feel like they could make educated decisions so they instead relied on more experienced/engaged players to make the decisions and they sat back. I love the theme of this game but I think it is a little too complicated for us. Keeping at the moment in the hope I can get it back to the table but willing to trade if it gets the right offer

The well designed solo rules are a nice addition but this is better with a group.

Long setup. A lot to explain to new players, plus the layout changes from scenario to scenario. I like Ignacy's games...but they are always a hard sell for my gaming group. The guy loves icons, and remembering a million icons is annoying. As far as coop games go...you are just going to lose each scenario, face it. The game is like getting all dressed up for an event that is definitely going to be cancelled.

Very good co-operative game (also playable solo, but I never tried it). Encourages planning in advance and is very satisfactory when our previous moves just come together nicely in the later phases.
Sometimes you get the feeling you're going to lose the scenario, only for a couple favourable decisions to turn the game on its head to give you the great feeling of accomplishment.
Takes some time to prepare though and the game time may exceed 2+ hours.

Really fiddly and hard co-op.

It's almost so hard that you should always play this game with the same group every time, since adding new players to the mix will only: 
a) lose the game 
b) make the game boring for the new player, since the experienced players will dominate every decision

The choices in this game matter a lot and you can't waste turns on doing stuff "just because"

RATING: 9
Cooperative worker placement, with a captivating thematic background. The storytelling part is so well done, that if you are into the island survival genre, it's almost role-playable, while the solid resource/risk management engine gives enough to think and argue about. There's too many things to concentrate to, so there's the constant dilemma of doing things safe and slow but running out of time, or take a more hazardous approach, while the game keeps throwing random stuff at you- and it does all this, without missing a thematic beat. 

The rulebook is intimidating at first, too many information scattered all over without a summarized guide, but if one tackle it, the game itself is really simple and intuitive.

An original and very creative co-op with mechanics I haven't seen before that holds its theme with a plethora of cards that mean you don't often encounter the same situations.

The game is tight like Ghost Stories and each scenario plays like a puzzle.  You can play them over and over too because there's enough variety of cards, land tiles and situations to make every game different.

The gameplay also provides a very thematic narrative.  This rating could go up after a few more plays.

A difficult masterpiece that is dripping with theme. This game hooked me into modern boardgaming. The first time I played this many years ago it absolutely blew me away and I still enjoy it today. A classic that never gets old.

RATING: 7
Before you sit down and attack this game, you must be prepared for the almost certain eventuality that you are about to spend 2+ hrs struggling through an ever deepening nightmare of tropical diseases, bad weather, and animal attacks that ramp up as your health dwindles, only to realise that you will not beat the game this time!
I don't get to play it much, and out of the 6 odd times I have played (castaways scenario only, so far), I've won twice! But It is SOOOOO satisfying when you do win. And when you loose, yes, you wonder why you just spent 2hrs playing this thing for it to mess you around and spit you out. There is a good reason though, and that is the theme. If you die in this game, its because you may not have the minerals to actually survive on a cursed island. I joke of course, what I mean is that the theme is so immersive that when you recount to yourself the events leading up to your terrible demise, it will sound like a story line for a film, "got ill from those berries, then Friday died whilst trying to build that godforsaken palisade, and the final straw was the wild animals taking my food just before the storm set in".
Win or loose this game is fun, you just need to be prepared for the worst before you play!

RATING: 8.4
Pros: Thematic, challenging, rich, and dramatic coop experience.
Cons: 
-The rules are a complex mess
-Fiddly with lots of bits and pieces to keep track of
-Can be somewhat dry if you get lost in the numbers and resource management
-Often overstays its welcome; plays better with an "intermission" about halfway through
-Susceptible to "alpha gamer" syndrome. Since each player doesn't have his own turn, cards, etc., it is essentially a collaborative solitaire game

Fun initially, but really this is a solo game.  One additional person adds to the experience a little, but beyond that, it's going to fall victim to quarterbacking.  There are also games you just cannot win based on how the cards come up and how the dice fall.  This seems like it happens too often.

The game has a great potential and my ranking will probably rise in time.

However, the rule book was way below the waterline. It was bad. When we started to play a lot of questions turned up - as expected in this type of game - but the rule book did not supply with answers. We had to find them here on BGG - some still is unanswered but we simply got tired of finding the answers and continued with the game.

If a thick rule book was considered a bad idea, a website with all cards and tokens explained would have helped a lot.

This game has a pretty nice ambience to it, but the rules are so fiddly as are all of the pieces and the setup time is long. I had the strategic aspects of each scenario figured out after one play, but the random elements (though thematically sound) made even winning seem like less of a victory than I'd like. It's just not a game that I feel excited to win or lose which is a strange feeling to have about a board game.

I just wish a single, complete rulebook/faq could be released because the game is tight enough that I really don't want to "cheat" on even the most minor points.

Casi siempre lo disfruto en solitario (que mal suena eso,jejeje). Muy buen cooperativo, difícil y desafiante y porqué no decirlo...algunas veces imposible. Pueden darse combinaciones de eventos, cartas, malas tiradas que hacen imposible realizar la misión de turno.

This game told quite a story and there are lots of cards to allow variability.  A favorite of my son who gets very emotionaly involved in the story.  Nice variety of scenarios to keep it fresh.  Setup takes some time.  Sometimes you have to make a ruling on an action because it is not totally covered, but since it is a coop, nobody is really disadvantaged.  Excellent game.

When we talk about this game apparently we make it sound like we actually experienced the island ourselves.  Surviving this game is a lot tougher than farming.

Update 1:  Rating based on using "Castaways Quick Start Guide to Robinson Crusoe" available in the files section on BoardGameGeek.  Without this fan made guide we would have had no idea how to start our first game after reading the instructions that came with the game.  Since we used this in our first game we never experienced the frustration of learning the game from the rulebook that others may have experienced.  Whether or not a game's rating should benefit from external material like this is too existential for me to concern myself with.

[u]23-Jan-2014[/u]:  Wow.  Seriously...wow.  What a game.  So thematic.  So tough.  Nice components and art.  The narrative in this one just unfolds as you play.  It's just what I was hoping it would be.

You play a character (or several if playing multiplayer) stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere, Robinson Crusoe style.  You must overcome just the basic needs of survival like eating and shelter and making tools and hunting and the weather.  But!  There are also six different scenarios included in the game with varying sets of goals to achieve.

So much in this game rides the wave of the theme so wonderfully.  Events come up that start rather simple and not too harmful, only to return later in the game to create havoc and a feeling of hopelessness.  Animals stalk you hoping to have themselves a tasty snack.  Storms batter your little hut as you huddle underneath the poorly constructed roof you built.  You search the island for supplies to build better tools and weapons to help your survival.

Oh my.  Just so much [i]juiciness[/i] packed into this co-op game.  It isn't easy.  But it is definitely fun.  Well worth the price of admission.

[u]09-Jul-2015[/u]: If I'm being honest, I have to admit this game is straddling the line between frustration and enjoyment. I've played eight times in total and have yet to win. And I believe only one of those did I actually have a chance for victory. Even so, I still really enjoy the game.

I find the narrative flow to be the game's strong point. There are so many events and things going on, I can't believe it actually holds together. Maybe others find this a detriment, but I get a lot of enjoyment from the experience of playing the game. There is much to be done, but there are never enough pawns to place on actions. Weather comes into play. Animals attack. Disease. Fire. Who knows what else?! It's a wild ride.

And so far, I'm staying on it. Maybe over time, the lack of success will eventually push me into that frustration area, but for now, I'm in. It's a fiddly game, with lots of decks of cards, and many tokens & cubes to keep track of, but the story created by this gaming experience has been excellent so far.

This is a good co-op game, rather punishing but feels a little too restricted to one very optimal play per scenario. It feels like it'll wear out its welcome once you've figured out how to best play each scenario. Great first time around but pretty boring after, and the game drags and takes way too long.  

Would rather play something like Arkham Horror instead.

This is my favorite board game. Ever. Its a wicked combination of immersive theme and a plethora of options during turns. Robinson Crusoe encourages sophisticated group thinking. 

The game brilliantly addresses the luck factor by (most of the time) giving you the option to use extra resources to avoid rolling dice and automatically succeed in whatever you are attempting. 

Please learn from my suffering! On a whopping six separate sad occasions, I set up the game and refreshed my memory concerning the rules- only to have the players decide to bail out on the attempt because they were overwhelmed and it had already taken up so much time. I was smart enough to recognize the merit of the game regardless, and I'm overjoyed that I stuck with it. YOU can and should avoid any similar sadness. This is a tough game to teach (to non-gamers, of course, even more so). There are a lot of different elements to keep track of. I heartily recommend playing through the game solo until you feel really comfortable with the setup and rules. I also recommend downloading one of the invaluable quick reference files here on the Geek.

This is a modern masterpiece of game design and I can't wait to see the future games that rely on its influence.

Played twice now and we still haven't gotten all the rules correct. That said, I do like the game, albeit, some things strike me as poorly thought out.

If this were the cougar (or better yet, a komodo dragon), it would make sense, but for an iguana?

Including promo cards

A wonderful cooperative game that is different each time you play it with tons of different event cards, weather that changes and of course the many different scenarios: 6 in the box, with some due out on the website (King King from what I heard at Essen), as well as an expansion I hope.

The experience is truly remarkable - a nice deep Ameritrash/euro hybrid that comes to life and actually feels real.

With regard to length - I don't know what people are talking about. Solo it's 30-45 minutes, and with two it's 60 minutes. Four might be a bit longer due to discussions, but hey, what would you expect on an uninhabited island?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Wow, I wish I knew what to think of this game. As a solo game it feels unbalanced after 10+ sessions; 2 or 3 of your 7 action choices feel under-powered in solo play, which is a real problem for me. It also feels as if the game is playing me at times. That's not necessarily a BAD thing in a game this thematic, but when I win I feel lucky, not good. Better in group play, but its length keeps it from hitting the table too often in most of my groups. I hope this one opens up a bit for me.

Once you negotiate the dense and confusing rulebook there is a tremendous game here. lots of moving parts and connected mechanisms.

If I could just win sometimes *!$*#

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A cooperative game par excellence that is simply frustratingly difficult to win because the rules are STACKED against you.  Even playing with the NPC allies Friday and the dog, you're still going to be hard-pressed to survive.  A fun game, with buckets of theme and lovely art - and, also, not replayable enough for me to warrant keeping on the shelves.  My then-friend Kelli in New Haven was a very sharp gal who picked the game up rather quickly and played it through twice or maybe 3 times with me.  As a present I gave her my copy and picked up a new copy of the original as well as the Beagle expansion and the promo cards - and then we drifted apart, I moved to Maryland and then back to OH... and it never got played again.

A GRAND game, just not a good one for my typical gaming group and the scheduling constraints thereupon.  Sold at auction on BGG.

I generally enjoy co-op survival games, this one however is one of my least favorites (despite the huge fan base and long wait list to purchase one). The game feels a bit more like worker placement (generally not fun for me), and there never seems to be enough time before something catastrophic happens.

Mixed feelings about this one.  Definitely great art, super replayable with scenarios, items, events, etc., challenging, but on the whole, too long and kind of mechanical.  I hear a lot that people say this game is all about the story, but I got the opposite feeling- I felt like I was playing a game (i.e. I didn't get "sucked in" to the story at all). So technically, a well made game, but not really my cup of tea.  Would play on occasion, but then again, with my group, not sure when I would ever get the occasion to play.

Ami elsőre átjön mindenkinek, akár tetszik neki a játék, akár nem: van hangulata.

A másik meg, hogy szép. De legalábbis nem csúnya.

Kooperatív, 1-4 játékosig + Péntek és a kutya, ha szeretnénk még képzeletbeli barátokat magunknak.

Ignacy ezt viszont kicsit túltolta, már ami a játékszabályzatot illeti. Nem az a játék, ami elsőre menni fog szabálykönyv lapozgatás nélkül. Sőt, valószínűleg a második sem. 40 oldal. Kicsit lehetett volna áramvonalasítani talán (3-4 féle jelölővel kevesebb, 2-3 pakli kártya a kukába és máris gyorsabban mennének a dolgok azon a k..rva szigeten). :0)

Mondjuk ahhoz képest érthető és logikus (szinte) minden, de mindenki számítson rá, hogy ahhoz, hogy ezt a játékot játszani tudja, bele kell tennie jó néhány órát.

Az meg csak annak éri meg, aki barátságban van az ameri játékokkal...

Nekem pont az a bajom, hogy nem szeretem az ameriket. A történetmesélős-kockadobálgatós játékoktól a falnak tudok menni. A Robinsonnak adok még esélyt, mert az első 1-2 játék kifejezetten érdekesre, izgalmasra sikerült.

Amazing game. Works great solo. Not even sure I'd want to play this co-op. Lots to think about every round. A very long game, for me at least. The 2 hr playtime listed seems short to me. I'm still new to the game, but I can't see getting it done in less than three. Be prepared to spend time thumbing through the rule book, the online faq, and additional forums; many questions about the rules will arise for your first few plays.

First impression is an 8; it's tough and the events, while random, fit the theme incredibly well. The way many events give you a boon but then get shuffled into the deck and hurt you later is pretty well executed; for example, a card came up while exploring telling us that we'd found mushrooms, giving us food. We had to shuffle the card into the event deck, and when it came up it hurt us all (eating wild mushrooms made us sick) unless we had the Cure invention.

The rulebook is tough to learn from (watch a video!) but it flows well once you get into it. 

Excellent, tough, thematic coop.

I must add that the support for the game and the positive presence of the designer has been impressive.

What a gem! The pride of our collection. A fantastic game about survival, adventure, and team work. Components are beautiful and numerous, but with some good organisation set-up is quick. Mechanics are easy to learn and rules are very thematic, meaning that queries can be solved with a little common sense. Plays just as well with 2 as it does with 4. 

Game play is tough, but in a co-op game that is excellent. Repeated plays have seen our strategies improve, but each scenario requires a different tactic, and the luck of the cards determines which challenges come our way. Can't wait for Z-Man to publish the expansion!!

RATING: 5
An overly hyped game that tries hard and gets some things right but has many problems:
1) the rules situation is a complete train wreck; many a wargame has a cleaner ruleset; lack of concensus even in rules clarification posts; I hate when an air of uncertainty hangs over an apparent victory
2) very high fiddly factor, protracted set-up
3) components not that great: board space poorly used; weird mix of mild and garish colors (the dice are truly ugly); tiny health track on character cards; what's up with the plastic cubes?
4) limited replay value: now that we've beaten Castaways (took three tries), there's little reason to play that scenario again
5) too long, more work than fun

Cons: Resource management focus. Cooperative.

Look forward to trying this again, but it's a little too wood-wanky for my tastes--it would be too easy to play this as a co-op resource management euro than it would be to see this as a narrative game, and the narrative is the only thing that would bring me to the table.

Aplha gamer, the game! Played it once, have absolutely no desire to ever play again. Thought it was necessary to have more than one player playing the game, and you are forced to follow a single persons plan to have a chance at anything.

It's quite long with a lot of fiddly and unclear rules. It's very thematic but the luck of draw and roll is too big for my taste at least when compared to the length of the game i.e. in Pandemic the Cure, the luck of roll is also high but the game only lasts 20-30 minutes so I don't care that much. Might play again to see if the other scenarios are more interesting but I don't feel the urge to play again and might be willing to sell my copy if someone makes me an offer I can't resist.

A rules-complex co-operative game that is hard-to-learn, but really thematic.  Each scenario provides a rich and detailed story on top of an interesting strategy game.  Three players seems the ideal player count: more challenging than with 4 players, but also much faster.  The gameplay gets rote and procedural if you focus only on the mechanisms.  With this game, you want to embrace the theme and ham up reading the flavor text on each card that flips. (Traded to Pierre for Trajan.)

I don't see the point playing this game with 3 other peoples. There is no "traitor" (Battlestar, Camelot), players dont have anything to manage (cards like Pandemic) or keep secret for themselves... So what's the point ?

Maybe 2 player game with my wife.
It's a solo game.

On the plus side, I found it somehow interesting, nice looking.

The rulebook is terrible.

Although bad luck with rolls can really destroy a game, I love the strategy of timing your builds and the mood of scraping by that this game creates.  This game is pretty immersive, because the random events and weather beat you into submission.  There are definitely better missions than others (the first put off my GF from playing again due to boredom), and the game is much better with fan-crated missions for replay-ability. 
The expansion adds some story diversity, but I'd rather have more event cards. My main complaint is that the event cards should have more diversity.  
Edit:  Good pre-game for Spirit Island.  I added a star ... je ne c'est quoi ... but this is still fun for me after a couple of years.

Very good Coop Game. A lots a tiny rules, that may seems complicated for a first time play. Played a 2 player game, first one we lost by one of us dying; the second one was a success. 
Played twice the introduction scenario in about 1h30 each (rules took about 1h10 to go through, before playing - first game for both of us).
Game seems a bit difficult if you don't manage stuff properly, with events and weather that are clearly not on your side. 
I definitely recommand it; even though it might be even tougher in a solo play.

Robinson Crusoe is so big, I almost want to call it a sandbox game, but it's not - it's more focused than that.

Besides, most of those oversights are covered off in an FAQ.

Wonderful cooperative game that tells a rich story. Fiendishly difficult but I always feel like I could've won upon reflection. Quality components and the board looks great.

A great co-op with a fantastic theme. You cannot hope to do even half of what you want to and are forced to make some pretty tough decisions. You need to take risks if you are going to succeed.

Reminds me of playing Arkham Horror with lots of tough threats, opportunities and risks.
Beautiful artwork and immersive but fiddly with LOTS of  administration required to generate the story environment. There is plenty of strategic and tactical decisions to make. Seems like a lot of replayability available. Not a game for everyone. If you like coop and thematic games with lots of chrome this should appeal but ultimately a niche game.

Pretty good solo game but fiddly setup really requires 2-3 sessions to make it worthwhile. Yet to play cooperative - anticipating big alpha player syndrome. Unlike Pandemic, at least everyone is doing something all the time.

The ZMan rulebook is poor, in respect of both learning the game and clarifying the game mechanics. There are many game rule exceptions not addressed by the rulebook so FAQ referral is necessary. Quite a few typos in the rulebook plus card misprints, which shows that ZMan rushed this into production.

Beautiful game and the most thematic 'Euro' game I've ever played. It's downside is that if my group wants to assign workers and explore, we prefer to compete for it (so something like Age of Empires). I enjoy it solo, but I've other games I prefer for solo play (the theme truly flourishes when playing with another). This is also another game where my wife loves the pieces, but not the game so much (it's too long for her).

Good, but not good enough.  Maybe it was just because I was tired, but this one just did NOT click with me.  The theme was there, but I just found it to be tedious work.  Can't say that it was fun.  Would be willing to give it another spin if someone wanted to, but wouldn't ask to play it myself.

Update 1/20/15:  Played my 2nd game.  Rules explanation was difficult and long.  Game played better this time and I had more fun, so I'm bumping this up to an 8.5.  However, I'm still not sure how much "really" I like it.

Compared to Castaways, RC is a heavier gamer's game with greater replayability.  However, my initial feelings are that Castaways tells a better story, and is a funner game to play.

Need to play both more for a better assessment.

I've played it several times and with different players. Almost all of the other players were frustrated with the way how brutal the game can be without you having a chance and werent very eager to play another round.

The theme never really shone in our games, so what remained was a luck-driven cube/token pusher.

And after some games where I really wanted to like the game, it really starts to rub off on me....

The solo game is still okay, though.

Yes, the rulebook (1st edition at least) is caca. Get the Castaway's Guide. Once you get over that hump, you have a game which creates amazing stories, filled with tension and memorable moments. The adventure cards are genius (and their absence in First Martians is what makes FM a worse game, IMHO). The press your luck aspect of dice rolling is a surprisingly effective way of giving you enough agency to feel elation when you succeed or curse your choices when you fail. Play wonderfully as a solo game. Feels much more open world than other coops like Pandemic. 

My faults, which take this from a 10 to an 8: 

(1) even after you understand the rules, there is a persistent level of ambiguity in various cards and effects that you really have to interpret the designer's intent far too often. This isn't ALL bad however, because this acts as a level for scaling difficulty: if things are going badly, interpret vague things in your favor. If things are going "too" well, interpret things against your favor.

(2) the game is punishingly hard. you are going to lose, a lot. losing is fun, sure, but i feel like the chances of winning are skewed a little too low, ideally you would have a balance closer to a knife edge to create a feeling of "can i win?" versus "i'm probably going to lose, let's hope a miracle happens". (I think Pandemic is much better at creating this knife edge, but probably easier to balance that game due to much simpler decision space in that game).

For what it's worth, I rated First Martians a 5.

Thus far.... not really impressed. The game has some randomness (I like random!), but the planning/actions that come after the random events and before the random events just seem pretty simplistic and not all that interesting. I reserve my right to change this, I'm only 3 plays in.

I acquired this game based on it's existing very high rating in here. Once you get going, it is a brilliant, challenging game, as many have already commented. However, it has the worst written rulebook that I can remember reading for any game, which for me puts a cap on how highly I can rate the game. The rulebook is badly structured, making the game unnecessarily hard to learn and also nearly impossible to quickly look up rules for reference, plus at least the English version is full of grammatical errors and unclear instructions. A few times we have had to make up our own rules/interpretation of the rules on the spot simply in order to keep playing.

I have been contemplating this one for a long time and have held off because so many folks in my original game group would have been put off by what has been described as the punishing gameplay. But over time my game group has evolved and now I has some friends who I think would be much more receptive to this game. So with second edition coming out I have gone back to seriously considering picking it up.

Ehhh. I'm not really feelin' this game. My group seems to love it but I don't. Eldritch Horror gives you the feeling of being an awesome investigator.

Game of the Year for 2013 I think.
Absolutely love this game, the theme is excellent and brilliantly implemented, especially for a Euro.  The mechanics are evil and constantly up against you.  The adventures and mystery cards are great, and the 'choices with consequences' aspect to them is genius, making each drawn card have its own little narrative.
There are some design elements which seem a bit dry, and the board is a little colourless for such an adventure game, but this does not detract from it being the most impressive game of the year in every other respect.

I'd been waiting for Z-MAN to release this in the US for nearly a year.  I thought this was going to be the game to quench every desire I've ever had for a game.  When the game finally arrived, I tore into it immediately (and organized all the chits...euphoria...).  But while I was impressed by the theme and design, I was extremely disappointed by the rulebook.  Since there is no consistent rule-set, I found myself debating whether an action was legal so many more times than necessary.

It also didn't help that I received Mage Knight as a wedding gift around the same time.

Solo game played.
Won the first scenario on turn 10, but still a pretty tough game, was down to 3 life at the end. Carpenter is recommended for this solo play scenario.

Had fun during play, and yes, this game tells a great story. The card mechanism is a great support of this.

One criticism is the rulebook, which after reading, I had no idea on how to play the game, watch the many videos before playing. Helped me greatly.

In this cooperative game, players are stranded on an island, and take on the role of soldier, cook, explorer or carpenter. Players have to solve one of the scenarios (building a fire to be rescued, or rescuing someone else who is stranded) with different victory conditions.

Players have to explore for food and resources. In addition they have to build palisades, shelter and weapons, to protect agains beasts and the weather. 

Players can also build materials.

The mechanism for this game is worker placement to do those actions. If you place 2 workers, you guarantee the action, but if you place only 1 worker, you have to roll dice which may generate event cards which can be bad. 

It's a tough game to learn on the first play, and even then it requires re-reading the rules. The board is not intuitively laid out on the order of which to do things either. 

I have only played once. If you like problem solving games, then this game is for you. If you get discouraged with many potentially fiddly rules, along with something that is not intuitive, this game isn't really for you. I like the problem solving aspect of this game, so if given the opportunity would like to try this again. But I was slightly turned off with the non intuitive rules.

RATING: N/A
I'm slightly turned off by the length of this game 2+ hours at least especially for first game as well as the complexity and heaviness. Usually I only like a game to be heavy/complex and/or long if it's a theme and mechanical style I REALLY think is truly awesome. I think it's cool that this is fully coop and people say it's one of best coops of 2012 and maybe the best one especially if you only count thematic games. People also say that the theme really comes through on this one and it really feels like being stranded on an island. Also they say that it has massive replaybility and each of the different situations/scenarios has a bunch of replability in and of itself. That being said, while I like thematic, and cooperative games, I don't know if I'm IN LOVE with the theme and what I've heard so far about gameplay enough in order to deal with having yet another long heavy game that has a steep learning curb and tricky rules especially for new gamers. I make exceptions for this sometimes if it really dazzles me but this one isn't quite there. However, based on awesome theme, cool fun factor, and overall great design I am very excited for it in general and do hope to have the chance to at least play the game.

[b]Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island[/b] by [person=4735][/person] (51st State, Stronghold...)

Still has the alpha player problem of co-op games, otherwise I have enjoyed my first plays. Not sure how much I will enjoy replaying the scenarios I have already tried, they may get old pretty quickly after their puzzle has been unlocked. Very good component quality.

March 2015 update:
Hmm... there are other games I´d rather play. This one takes some time to setup also. I think it´s a decent attempt, appears to be one of the best so far, but lacks the infinite depths of reality, which such "survival games" need to really set them apart and make them special.

RATING: 4
My plays and feelings toward this have fluctuated quite a bit. My first game was extremely tight - 2 HP, 2 HP, and 3 HP remaining, and we had just enough wood. It was tight, close and fun.

But then, I realized we were playing this tiny rule wrong or that tiny rule wrong or that small exception incorrectly. I hated looking these things up to clarify it. There were so many gray areas, and the rules breaks destroyed the immersiveness of the story.

I also found the game swingy, sometimes too easily so, and sometimes too hard so. I think the health track should've been bigger too since your cubes can slide a bit on the cramped space and you're always adjusting. Another thing I hate is how so many "events" are really just the same variation of "bad weather". Really now? -_- They could've made it so much more thematically interesting. The item texts should've had clarification too. The question marks are also extremely unfriendly to colorblind people.

I've played scenario 1, the Robinson Family scenario, and the volcano island, and overall, I didn't feel extremely thematically tied. I think the basic mechanic of place workers->roll is kind of meh to me. The rolling just doesn't feel that thematic for a thematic game, since its a bit too abstracted to be engrossed. This is hurt by the rules breaks especially.

I do like the event deck and how things come back, and I like the different characters. I think their costs should've been cheaper to use abilities though. It would've made it a bit more balanced and would've been more fun I think.

Anyway, overall, a disappointing game.

Majority of this game is due to pure luck of the rolls of the dices. This is not the fault of the game since it is designed this way to show the randomness and harshness of nature.

The rulebook of the German Third Edition is just badly written. But as soon as you understand the core concepts of RC the game starts to shine. 

RC has some great ideas (recurring cards) but some flaws are present (you can identify the card type by the back).

As a solo game RC works best, MP is fun but you need to actively avoid quarterbacking. 
The scenarios are hard and you'll get a lot of games out the box.

Too many rules by half, but this does a great job of telling a story and communicating its theme. For all of the bookkeeping that you have to do here, you have to make very few decisions, usually allocating two pawns a turn (often to the same spot!), which does mean that some players might end up playing unexciting games largely doing mundane tasks like building tools or collecting food for the good of the group.

A cooperative thematic game is usually not the kind of game I prefer (with the noteworthy exception of Space Alert). Also there is a lot of luck involved that is usually another minus for me (but clearly a needed part of the design in this case, otherwise the game would be just uninteresting).

In spite of this I like this game and my family liked it even more.

It is a nice simulation with a lot going on.

Two drawbacks.

The first is that the rules are not smooth, especially the way they are written down. There are often small doubts coming up, even after playing many games (although the doubts tend to be only about tiny matters, even only after one game).

The second is that the game is tense and really making the players curious to know what is going to happen next, but after some games the game (and the way it is played) seems to be scripted, even if the author put much effort in giving a lot of materials (for example there are really a lot of event cards). 

But these are minor quibbles. The only reason my rating isn't higher is because it is not the kind of game that I prefer. I enjoyed very much the first games and you may like it even more if you like this sort of game more than me. For example my daughter likes it really a lot.

I advise you to play it, whatever your tastes, at the very least to enjoy the adventure-feeling of the game and the original mechanics. 

It is unique in its genre.

UPDATE October 2013
I played the game again after some time and I liked it less, especially because it is quite painful to refresh memory about all the micro-rules, especially because you need the FAQ to understand how some of them work. 

Besides IMHO the number of meaningful decisions is too little compared to luck and bookkeeping.

Consequently I have lowered the rating from 7 to 6 and possibly I would rate it even lower if it were not that my daughter really likes it: the thematic experience seems the strong point of this game, but it is not what I search for in a game, not only at least.

I love coop games, so a high rating for Robinson Crusoe is a no brainer. The game is highly thematic and brutal, but the proof that it is such a great one is that strategy pays off every single time.

It's shy of a 10 solely for its setup time. Shuffling all cards, checking every single small rule, preparing the board, it all leads to my sincere sigh when someone suggests playing this otherwise remarkable game.

[B]TTS Play:[/B] Really enjoyed my first play of scenario one - it was interesting and engaging.  Played the Cook and rocked it thanks to the karma of the island: the broken bottle and pistol starting items kept me alive during beast encounters - I would not have lasted long without them.  My healing ability (soup!) and cloud reduction (warm food!) kept my health (and moral) up.  I explored a ton during the no weather turns and that REALLY helped (just took the hit for no shelter, and just healed myself later...).  The hatchet was essential for wood and just when I needed more there was a hurricane, for +2 wood.  The animal fights were timed perfectly, bringing food and pelts so I didn't need wood to improve shelter.  Really fun game...  It was a close last round, but I had played smart and mitigated the weather on the ninth round fine - was rescued the tenth round...  Going to snag the cardboard version of the game ASAP.  Got the cardboard in hand and loving it!  Another awesome play - down to the freakin' wire... Too cool, too cool.

Unfortunatelly I bought a first edition and the rulesbook is awful. A lot of rules are unclear, colours of pones are different then in instruction.
I saw second edition which have a way better printed. Quality of components are better, there is new rulebook, there are additional player aids etc. which makes game MUCH more friendly.

The game itself isn't that bad, it's just not my favourite type of game. Leader syndrom is very visible in that game so most probably if I ever will play it again, I'll probably play myself anyway.

Agricola has been described as "misery farm." This is its sequel, misery island. In general, I do not much care for games in which your beginning situation is the best you will ever have; in which you are the pilot of a terminal flight, and your aim is to eject before you crash. Robinson Crusoe is an exemplar of this genre. Still, the atmospheric value of Robinson Crusoe is beyond dispute, and I can see how it garners such adoration from its fans.

Difficult co-op game. This game plays very close to the edge, you're always just on the cusp of dying, and you really need to decide if you want to spend more time being safe and risk not completing your goals, or push your luck and risk suffering some horrible fate. Pretty stressful, actually. It is somewhat complicated as well, since you have different scenarios, all of which have slightly different rules.

RATING: 7.9
Great cooperative adventure game, especially for gamers tired of Pandemic or people who want to beyond this level of gameplay.

Everything on it is hugely thematic, you can write a story, even if the manual doesn't go into explaining theme very deeply, but it just make sense if you come to think about it.

A great mix of ameritrash and eurogame mechanics. 

I think it's inevitable to compare it to Castaways, because of its theme, their cooperative nature and because they were published at the same time. Even if the gameplay feels completely different, the have some mechanics and elements in common.
-> The strategy/tactic is very plain in Castaways, you do almost the same in every game. In RC, besides having different scenarios, you can try very different strategies (even with the same items).
-> RC wins making a bet for the cooperative nature; I just don't like semi-cooperative games.
-> RC is immensely more replayable; even one of its scenarios is more replayable than the whole Castaways.
-> RC is shorter.

In my mind, there's a clear winner.

A good story-driven game along the lines of Tales of Arabian Nights.  

Like ToAN, don't expect a whole lot of planning ahead for later turns, but rather players try to "surf the wave" of the story and make the best of the bad situations that come up randomly.  

It's a "fun but not fair" kind of game, so if you demand game balance or fairness, this is probably not your game.
There is also a continuing issue with one player possibly dominating the rest and telling them what to do. This is a common problem in co-op games, of course.

Rating reduced for poor graphical layout.  With so many icons floating around you'd think that they would be bigger and more readable.   It makes a difficult-to-introduce game even more cryptic, especially for non-gamers.

Score after first play. I generally do not like co-op games. Because when I play I want to win aganist real players around the table. But I enjoyed at my first game. This game has lots of seems balanced game mechanics and has a god theme combined with its own changeable story. But some rules are not clear and open to discuss. Like weather effect/eating situation of player which is away from camp lost while exploration. These situations should be cleared by developers. I will modify score after playing some more. Also game took 4 hours for our first game! This is not a 2 hour game even its setup takes 15-20 minutes. We give breaks while playing even the first scenario castaways. Quality of game pieces, game box and art is perfect. But I did not like advertisement on the sides of box even they are not seem from outside when game is closed. I do not like seeing advertisements of other games on my board game boxes. These advertisements should be different small booklet inside box.

RATING: 9
This is a game of survival, where each scenario adds an objective on top of that.  Maybe you have to rescue someone, maybe you have to lift a curse, maybe you have to fend off cannibals ... but in each scenario you have to: get food so you don't starve, build a shelter so you don't die of exposure, fend off beasts like tigers/snakes so they don't kill you.  On top of that there are mysterious treasures to find, random events and strange events.   So, there is adventure here, but the focus seems to be on survival - brutal conditions with no one to rely on but yourself - I know in real life I'd probably die, I wouldn't know what to eat, how to hunt or even start a fire - so far removed I am from my ancestors!

The game has open information and a loose turn structure when it comes to actions, so don't play with bossy people if that's going to bother you.  The game also forces you to develop a strategy and stick to it.  There are many, many things you can do and want to do in this game, but you can't do everything.  Anything that distracts you from your chosen strategy better be worth it!


The game hasn't been as brutally difficult as I thought it would be.  Certainly much easier to win than in Ghost Stories!

My rating is based on playing the first six scenarios, at least three times each  - the first scenario "Castaways" was a lot easier than I expected, which I have now won three times in a row - all scenarios offered a lot of strategy and also threw a lot of problems at you, which made you decide whether alleviating a new problem was worth it if it was going to divert you from your scenario goals.

The second scenario was very different, and virtually impossible for me, because I had the rules wrong!  Like any game, getting the rules wrong can destroy game balance and here it was devastating!  Once I did get the rules right, it was much easier, but the strategy I employed was futile and I had to change things up quite a bit.  What I 'wanted' to do, just wasn't really possible.

The third scenario was again quite different and challenging, though with so many plays under my belt I did quite well on my first try.   The fourth scenario was interesting and quite different.  The fifth scenario felt overly difficult due to pure luck and so I don't care for it - just too frustrating.  Scenario six was challenging, but possibly my favorite because you get the chance build so many cool things.

At the end of the day, I think calling it "Survival on the Cursed Island" would have been a much more accurate description.  Except for Scenario 5, there isn't much 'adventure' compared to just surviving: hunting, gathering, building.  That's the focus.  There's a huge deck of treasures, traps and monsters, but you pull very, very few of them each game.

(I've  managed to fry the brain of non-gamers friends/family I've tried to play this with.)  Some of the complaints about the rule book seem to be unfounded in my second edition of the game.  There's a couple of things I've had to look up on the internet but that's it.  Brain burn is an issue, however, and the rules take a lot of learning and re-learning. If you're prepared to put in the effort though, it does provide a memorable thematic experience.  Playing it with dedicated gamers I'd give it a 8 or a 9 rating; casual gamers only a 6 or 7.

Very-very good co-op with awsome theme. Gameplay elements are basicly worker-placement euro but we've been playing the events 'on suspense' (we're not reading whats going to happen when it comes back out from the action-deck. And it gives awsome story. If there wouldn't be Sentinels of the Multiverse I'd call it best co-op atm, but atm its kinda torn...

Eagerly awaiting to play it, this cooperative game made me read the classic book Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe, published in 1719. Reading the full book clarified why some features are in this highly thematic game.

I am impressed with how the game really is a game system, using scenarios that alter the story and goals.

One of the best games I have played. Even though it has a lot of rules, they aremostly intuitive and add up to a phenomenal game playing experience. For me the rules fade in the background and it is an adventure I go through (and sometimes survive) with a story to tell afterwards.

To jeszcze gra, czy już film?
Arcydzieło wśród gier kooperacyjnych i około-przygodowych. Świeże i ożywcze spojrzenie na planszówkowe mechanizmy, świetna oprawa i namacalny klimat. Długo czekałem na taką grę.
Uwaga - gra ma dość słabo rozpisaną instrukcję, brak jej systematyzacji i skorowidza oraz karty z skrótem zasad. Dajcie jej szanse, bo zasady są banalne!
EDIT: nowa edycja ma już poprawione zasady - nic tylko kupować!

[b]Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]We actually had a lot of fun playing this one, but man the rule book was a mess. I got tired of feeling like we were continually playing the game wrong and the huge FAQ was not fun to search through. If this game had a clean rule set it'd still be in our collection getting played.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- A truly immersive gaming experience, one of the first games I've played that really tells a story of your particular adventure.
- The artwork is awesome, the tiles look beautiful and I love how the character mats and various decks of cards have sepia toned gesture drawings that look like they were done with ink in a field artists sketchbook.
- The production is top notch, there are absolutely no cut corners in this game, the $ of this game is definitely more than justified once you open up the box.
- Amazing how such a complex game flows quite smoothly after your first play or two. 
  [i]Overall I found the rule book to be well written and any other questions I had were answered on one of the faqs found here on BGG.[/i]
- I love how brutal this game can be, it really intensifies the stress you feel and forces you to work together as a team if you are going to have any chance at surviving [i](i.e. winning).[/i]
- The game does take a while [i](our games have been between 1 1/2 to 2 hours each)[/i], but time flies since the game is so engaging.
- By far the best co-op I've played, in fact I already bought the first expansion, but we won't break it open till we play through [i](and survive)[/i] the rest of the scenarios in the base game.

I'm happy that my buddy Jason brought this over to our house and taught us the game; I didn't want to by it sight unseen since most co-ops haven't been a hit in our house. With Forbidden Island/Desert for those times when we need a quick game and Robinson Crusoe when we want a meaty, story telling experience I think we're done adding co-ops to our collection for a good while.[/i]

I love building the inventions and exploring! This is a wonderful cooperative game of adventure, hunting, building and survival! There are 6 scenarios (so far) that come with the game, fan made expansions and two from the designer are available in the file section here on BGG. The events and weather that your characters will face are really active, constant and can be very damaging. So the race to meat the goals of the scenarios are quite challenging to pull off a win. 

I will say I did find the first 2 scenarios not too challenging. I hope they ramp up in intensity, sort of keeping in mind getting the rules down and becoming more intelligent to the game play. We shall see with more plays.

Fun game with a group of people. Good planning and cooperation required. Great replay-ability due to different scenario's and many events. However the luck and randomness of the cards and all the little rules doesn't result in a smooth and balanced playing experience. I feel the game is highly overrated and too rule-complex for what you get as an experience.

An amazing pure co-op game that is difficult but not impossible to over come. To play RC you have to be in the mindset of a survivor, you are stranded cold, exposed, and hungry with little to no food, no shelter, and just what you could carry off the ship! No other game I feel gives you such a pure form of decision making as does RC.  You truly have to decide each turn what is the most important thing you need to accomplish this turn as there are plenty of options, but as a group your resources and workers are few. No decision is obvious, every actions is helpful(necessary) in one way or another, and every choice is a risk.

The only differentiation between characters are their unique 4 powers, similar to how in Pandemic et al you have a unique power. All of these come at a cost though so they're not done at will. But in board-based co-ops, board position hugely differentiates players. Here there's nothing else to differentiate. Which is surprisingly disappointing as it means rich pickings for the bandleader to identify the best approach during the action selection and direct traffic. The game complicates things by providing a risk mechanic which is at least diverting ... place 2 workers on a spot and get it with no risk, or place 1 worker and roll dice to see if you get a wound, if you get the action at all, and if you get a card event to manage additionally. Which brings the game thematically to life, bringing despair at ever overcoming the perils of the island. And that's the game's strong point - theme, theme, theme - plus a differing challenge each time you play a scenario based on what the many different big event decks provide you. I just wish the co-op aspect was more than pooling your workers and agreeing on a united approach.

"Pretty heavy pure co-op with strong theme."

What I like:
- Theme is strong throughout the game
- Highly variable setup should help replayability
- Excellent gender options for characters

What I don't like:
- Encourages play-by-committee rather than individual action
- Longer and more complex than I would prefer
- 2p requires the neutral Friday helper (not terrible, but not ideal)

My 2p learning game took about 2.5 hours, which wasn't bad, but is pretty long. Hopefully next time will go quite a bit faster.

I think the BGG-voted 3.4 weight might be just a bit too high, but there is definitely a lot going on.

Tried it once. Thought I had won. I lost. I got many rules wrong. Way too many rules and errata. Constant rules questions and faq checks on bgg, long set up time, very fiddly. It is a solitaire game and absolutely failed when trying to play with my wife, who had not invested in rule study for days as i had and therefore could not contribute any ideas, or have fun. I played by myself. Be careful of breathing on your character card as that will move your tiny health markers around and once that happens, good luck figuring out where they were originally. Really just a dice roll luck fest with much more losing than winning, and considering the time needed to learn it properly, not worth the investment. Once it was packed up, I dreaded the idea of ever unpacking it again. 

This will hopefully work much better when it becomes an IOS app, removing the need for errata study and all the set up.

RATING: 9
This is an excellent game for solo or cooperative play.  The best positive is the huge variety of events, tools, animals, treasures, etc, so that each game played is different, and can range from repeatedly catastrophic to really easy depending on the timing and management of some key early decisions.  My only criticism is that the variety of gameplay inevitably forces situations in which the rules have to be searched, often without success, for the appropriate resolution.   In a cooperative game, it is easy to resolve with experienced players by developing an on-the-spot consensus of a reasonable why of handling the situation. There is not enough setup for some of the scenarios such that it is sometimes time consuming to set up a scenario because you are trying to figure out how to handle certain issues in this scenario.  These problems are caused primarily because the game has so many diverse dimensions, so I would rather have the game with these issues than not have the game.

The Rulebook is pretty poor, but thankfully Ricky Royal has some good walk-throughs on YouTube to get you started. Plus there is a cheat sheet round summary in the files for this game. Can't understand why the game makers wouldn't have included their own one.

Once you get into this game it is extremely immersive and the theme comes through strongly. Like A Few Acres of Snow it has the kind of artwork and presentation that brings me back to my childhood, which is a massive plus. Add to that, the fact that this is an excellent solitaire experience and we have  a winner :)

This is a tough one, at least based on my two plays. You must work together to build a fire out of wood so that a ship finds you when it passes on a the island you are shipwrecked on. You explore, build up tool and hunt while trying to stay feed and out of the cold and other weather. The cards are quite random and tough to plan for. AN interesting take, but it is hard to beat some of the top games in the genre already out there. Nevertheless, still a nice game.

I often like to call this game: the Dark Souls version of boardgaming (at least in my collection) 

considering that you will die 90 % of the games  you play (except for the first mission who is considerably easier)

Surprisingly one of the games in my collection that is loved by every game group I ever played with. 

Its gorgeous lavish set up as well as it beeing a coop and the sheer will of survival you have to bring up to win this game makes it a total keeper for me. 

also the fact that it is doable as a 1 player is nice too. though I would love to have more characters to choose from than four.

How on earth did this make the top 20? I don't remember there ever being snow on the said island which put me in stitches and made the theme very thin! But after all is said and done this game is so over rated. If I want a tough game that is a coop I would opt for Ghost Stories a game that sets a similar feel without all the unnecessary fluff (and is much tougher) or BSG which actually pulls off the theme. I really don't want to play this again!

I can't understand how people can say this game is so difficult either. Seriously BSG and Ghost Stories are much tougher, particularly Ghost Stories.

Update: played a four player game on the last scenario of the game. Beat it in round 8. This game is pretty easy to be honest. This scenario was a little better but I would prefer to play Dead of Winter! From a 2.5 to a 3.

The problem with this game is that it feels like you are making choices and trying to work together against a real challenge.  Yes, the rules are ad hoc and written poorly; but a few game-plays will smooth everything out.  So, after figuring out how to play and losing about 35 games,I starting taking a hard look at the mechanics and structure of the game. Conclusion: there is no real choice & everything is randomly stacked against the players.  The three times I won was when dice rolls went well and random cards didn't effect the game.  The frustration mounts when you realize that the structure of the scenarios are to defeat you at the beginning and become more defeating as you play.  Basically, you loose if you do this or loose doing something else.  

What is worse, is that the game becomes immediately more difficult the more players you have.  

This game can be fun, if change several rules bringing some real choice to the game.

Robinson Crusoe is a scenario-based cooperative game that features a number of player roles.  Unlike a lot of more recent cooperative games, this game makes no attempt to obscure information or play one player off another--everything is essentially decided as a group.  While that may cause "alpha gamer" problems in some groups, I found that the decisions to be made in this game were interesting enough that it didn't really bother me.  I particularly liked the event system, where event cards are drawn because a particular action is taken, part of it happens immediately, and then the card is shuffled into the event deck so that the rest of it can happen at some undetermined time in the future.  I'm generally not a big fan of cooperative games, but I found this one to be interesting and intricate enough that I'd be willing to play it again.

A lot to explore here. I purchased in early 2014 for full price, and was immediately smitten by the theme, the artwork, the bits... everything is gorgeous.

The rulebook was quite difficult. There are excellent play aides that help, and some great videos from both the designer and others that I highly recommend new owners of the game check out. Once you do that, and try a solo play through or two, you can get 95% of what you need to play and enjoy the game.

My 10 year old son and I had a blast playing this - he was really excited by the story that was being told, and we had several "stand up die rolls" that were thrilling for both of us.

I've been playing games for over 30 years, including some monsters in tournaments like ASL and Star Fleet Battles - and I found this game to be very challenging to learn. But like complex those titles, this one is worth the effort.

Will it hold my interest as long as those? Not sure, but they are doing a good job releasing promos and expansions, so it could still be around in a few years. I'd love to see a space themed version of this game ("Robinson Crusoe on Mars"!).

I'd love to see this game on iOS - it would eliminate the long setup time, would enforce those dozen or so niggling little rules exceptions that come up ("does Friday's remaining health score VP?" (no)).

If you are the game buyer in your group, and your group will play coops (likes Pandemic), and you don't mind investing several hours on your own learning this game before introducing to your group, and you can live with a number of rules that you will surely get wrong your first couple of plays... This game can be highly rewarding.

I feel rather like a logistic manager of recources than an adventurer that tries to survive on an island. 
Way to many exceptional rules, make it necessary to consult constantly the rule book. (and with the german rules, they made a good job!) 
Thereby it is impossible for me to immerse into the scenario. And it stayed that way, even as i started to memorize all the fiddly unstreamlined rules after a few plays(!).

I would like to like this game very much, but for me the mechanical struggle between luck of dice rolling/card drawing and the logistic part of recource management doesn´t create a tension of survival on an island at all. The flavor text on the cards can´t distract the lack of experience on a gameplay level.

It reminded me a bit of bad old "roleplaying" experience: Untalented storyteller reads flavor text from a book - group of "adventurers" rolling dice - compare result to your character stats - win/loose.  schhrrrrrffff

In my opinion a gamedesigner who has the aim to create a storytelling game should invest more time in researching gamemechanics that emerge relevant player interaction, instead of using just illustrations and flavor text to achive that goal.

Excellent deep co-op worker placement game.  It has a good challenge and story mode.  I like how each scenario plays as a different game.  Scenarios are generally very well done.

It can be complex and a little longer.  The dice can really mess with the flow of the game.

So far seems interesting. Luck factor feels a bit high but with good play can be mitigated somewhat. Game is not forgiving of bad decisions since the whole system is severely stacked against you. Not a fan of some of the cards which are essentially "sorry you lose" cards. They can be too severe. will update after further plays.

Game ultimately isn't that complicated, but the rule book is terrible and makes the whole experience of learning the game painful. Get this game figured out solo first before introducing it to others to spare them the torture. The rule summaries and faq are requirements.

Finally got to play, and we struggled with the rules a lot.  As first time payers, both of us decided we wanted to either play it again with someone who is very familiar with it or learn it much better before playing again.  We were told they are reprinting it due to problems people have with the rule book, and that rule book was a little on the awful side.  We lost and had a frustrating time figuring a lot of it out.

This seems like it could be a game I'd like, but we had too many interruptions when we needed to look up details in the rules, so I didn't really get into the game. There's exploration/hunting/building, and trying to survive, and it's a coop. Needs another try.

We tried again, and it was fun, though we lost horribly again....

We got our own version (the German one from Pegasus), and tried the first scenario again. There was still some time spent checking the rules, but I think we got most of it right, and we managed a win too!

I hate weather. And hunger. And the stupid Alligator who is terribly strong and doesn't even provide a skin. What the heck are alligator boots made of, huh???

This game is mean. And hard. In my three attempts, I've only once come close to winning the first scenario. That said, it's also really fun. I love this theme (thanks, Friday), and there are thematic elements throughout the mostly euro-influenced design. 

The game is a bit of a worker-placement number. One interesting part of the game is that a player can (usually) choose to use either a single or multiple workers to select an action. With multiple workers, the action is guaranteed to succeed. With only a single worker, a player must roll a set of custom dice and face the consequences. Thankfully, there are ways to mitigate bad rolls. 

One word of warning: the rule book is pretty atrocious. Be prepared to spend the first game or two fruitlessly searching for answers to your rules questions. The first printing of the Z-Man edition also apparently contains a major error. Seek the corrected pdf online. If you plan to teach this to your group, I'd highly recommend setting it up for a solo run-through beforehand.

I get why people love this game.  It's complex, rich, and very thematic. However, I rarely want to play this. I have yet to play a game where we won and didn't think "wait, did we cheat"? There are some poorly worded cards and a number of fiddly game rules, so we always have the rulebook at hand, although we've played it a half dozen times.  This takes me out of the game and reduces my enjoyment.  Additionally, I'm more interested in building something awesome than constantly have terrible things happen to me. There is very little relief in the game. If the game play was smoother, I might be more inclined to enjoy the beating.  My partner likes it a lot though.

Robinson Crusoe is a very thematic cooperative (puzzle) game that is much harder than it appears. Unless you enjoy pain, start with the Dog and Friday no matter the player count. I was surprised at how smooth the game play was once the rules were learned properly. My main concern is that despite the different scenarios the game is going to have an optimal way to play each scenario that will eventually feel very scripted reducing replayability. Due to the game being brutally difficult it will be almost impossible to win any scenario doing anything outside of a scenario's optimal strategy. This will reduce or eliminate any possible "fun" in the game to everyone following the orders of the most experienced player and thus the big problem with co-op (puzzle) games is exposed.

Pros:
* Excellent artwork and graphic design.
* High quality game components.
* Very thematic game play.

Cons:
* Co-operative "games" are really just puzzles.
* Excessive shuffling of the event deck.
* Ridiculously hard.
* The most experience player is likely to tell everyone what to do.
* There are still rule conflicts...

1. Rule book page 13: "[i]All tokens in Action spaces ...are discarded after applying their effect.[/i]" and on the same page: "[i]If the token is on any of the Action spaces for the Shelter, Roof, Palisade, or Weapons [...] The token is not discarded when these spaces are used.[/i]"

3. Soldier card says: "[i]Discard 2 Determination tokens to increase the Palisade or Weapon level by 1.[/i]" and in the rule book on page 34: "[i]Discard 3 Determination tokens to increase the Palisade or Weapon level by 1.[/i]"

Really good solo or at 2 players, I don't personally like it with more as it gets a bit AP prone. I'm not convinced how likely it is to win because you make clever decision v how likely the game setup makes it for you to win, and I'd be tempted to say that the game plays itself for the most part. But the narrative, and the sense of the board and decks as this maleficent goblin trying to get under your skin by throwing crap at you, definitely work, and out of the puzzley games this is my favorite by far.

Downgraded to 7, as with more plays it started feeling like the deck happens to you, more or less.

I've now tried several times to play this on several different occasions and each game is an exercise in extreme frustration.  At first I thought it was enjoyable and we were experiencing rotten luck in our games, but after the last few sessions, I am pretty convinced everything has to go right for a win: favorable map layouts, 1-action events, and most of all, no bad rolls (which is next to impossible).  I am tired of playing the base game and will likely give this one more go on the Beagle expansion, but I expect the results will be much the same.  Going to the DMV is often more enjoyable than this game.

When you play a game of Ignacy Trzewiczek there seems to be 2 certitudes: 1) you'll get a rulebook that will give you a headache with lots of little rules here and there and without any player aid to help you. 2) Lots and lots of different symbols, but I must admit that in this game they seem to be logic.

When I'm writing this (16/08/2013), Robinson Crusoe has an average rating of 8.08 and is number 2 in the BGG-hotness. And just like with 'Legends of Andor', I'm wondering, 'Why'? 
This is mainly a game where you have to turn over cards and tokens and undergo what is written on the card/token. 
It's not bad as a co-operative game, but I guess I'm sort of fed-up with co-operative play. They are almost more of the same. If you own Pandemic, Yggdrasil and Defenders of the Realm, you can consider that you'll have all co-operative games you need (and if you want something semi - co-operative, get Shadows over Camelot).

Great theme, great artwork, great coop game. Does all it can to get you into the theme, but it also depends on how much players are willing to immerse. Rules can be a bit scary for new gamers, but I wouldn't call them old school. Modern game, lots of variety, love the different scenarios. The game is made so well that you forget that it's essentially a worker placement. My girlfriend was fooled by it so she likes it and asks to play it. A really fun experience, especially if more experienced players don't take over the game. Good that you can also customise difficulty pretty well. LOVE the artwork on the beast cards! Long time since I found such a truly epic game.

I really wanted to like this game. It fell short so many times though.

I am yet on the fence about this one. It sure has lot of great mechanics. The components are very good and the integration of theme and gameplay is fantastic. I should love this, but... I don't know. Maybe the fiddliness distracts me too much? Need more games to get a definitive verdict on this one.

Edit: Traded it away. It was not just the fiddliness. What really bugged me in the game was that I never got the feeling that I was building or achieving something. Instead, I was just constantly reacting to the random events the game threw at me.

Yes, a Co-op. I don't generally like them. This could easily have a leader issue. I just played the first scenario as a 2 player game. Ron and I could talk it out but ultimately, he could have definitely just done whatever felt right. Dripping with theme. He didn't like it. I thought it was pretty enjoyable.

+Outstanding Theme. Scenarios, characters, card decks adds endless variety. Cooperative adventure great for groups where competitiveness can sour an evening. There is usually always discussion about how a handful of decisions could have altered the outcome. Sometimes the game wins, but that usually leads to wanting to play again soon. Players can tweak with difficulty.

=Some luck outcomes, but they usually range from not noticeable to adding flavor. Easy to learn, but benefits greatly from having an experienced player in the mix

This is a game where you start off in a bad place, and everything you do that helps your current situation makes your life worse later when the encounter you had comes back up through the event deck. It's incredibly fun when your choices come back to bite you. I've never been so on the edge of my seat when playing a co-op game.

The only thing that would make this game better is if you weren't supposed to read the eventual potential consequences of the cards, but the game would need a companion app to accomplish that.

Brilliant.  A whole hell of a lot of game jammed into one box.  The hopelessness, the brutal reality of island life, the beauty of the board...these things merge into what can only be described as board gaming excellence.  Loses .5 only because I hate little cards.  They annoy me, and there's a lot of them in the box.  

Updated: Playgroup finally agreed to try it out.  They felt it was around an 8.0, meaning they enjoyed it less than I do, but they did like it better than the average type of things I hoist on them when I get to pick.  Still one of my favorites, but I'm dropping it .5.  It's a bit more fiddly than I remember, but a very good game nonetheless.  Feel like it could use a rulebook update to streamline the process of teaching and setting up.

Playing in easy mode (with both Friday and the dog) in a two player game, the final weather dice roll would either kill us, or leave us alive to win, and we got lucky and pulled it off, in part due to a nearly endless string of good luck. ON EASY MODE. Fun, and a game of constant cooperation to try and succeed. While the main title of the game is 'Robinson Crusoe', and the first scenario is in essence the basic premise of the titular book, the other scenarios only share in common the gameplay and the island stranding, with scenarios ranging from a volcano, to cannibal tribes, to what is in essence the plot of the film 'The Fog'.

The setup and length though are a little offputting, as with most games that have the sorts of variable setups and huge numbers of different cards and decks that have different setups.

Played with many different groups now and it's quite enjoyable. Continues to remind me of Arkham Horror in terms of the narrative depth, but find it to be a more enjoyable game as the decisions are more meaningful and it is a more strategic and tactical experience with less total luck involved.

This game is theme, it is brutal and unforgiving but it makes sense. Surviving in the harsh environment of an unknown island should not be easy and it really isn't, but it tells a great story, your actions have consequences and that is very very clever. When you do win it feels fantastic though.

RATING: 8.5
Very nice cooperative game, that feels very consistent and logical. There's a lot of effort to wrap both the theme and the gameplay together and join them in one package. I like the elegance of certain game mechanics and the thrill of learning about new threats and ways of overcoming them. I like that it mixes cards, worker placement and dice. There's never enough resources and you have to decide where to stretch thin. The ruleset is intimidating, but once you digest it, it feels very natural and easy to remember. Not sure about foreign editions, but 3rd print of PL (original) one comes with quite well organized manual and learning the game isn't that problematic. Some people say that there's just too many rules to remember - I cannot really agree with that. It's very smooth and you get the player/round reference sheet that is a great aid during the game.

There's a lot of diversity provided by plethora of different cards, exploration, animals, scenarios - good replayability. Each time it feel's more like an adventure as opposed to "us vs the board". I'm not sure how it tackles with the "leader" effect. Leader can still very well dictate the worker placement for all players. Leader will check dice face distribution, or will perform calculations from gained vs spent. Yes, he cannot lead a straight way to win, as the situation changes constantly, but he will definitely be in position to get the best out of the board in current round. But it's true, that the game encourages tactic discussion a lot, way more than other coops I've played.

You still can be screwed up pretty badly by bad card draw or dice roll. The game is hard, and it's unlikely that you win in any of first few plays. But it presents a cool challenge you actually want to accept.

I enjoyed this. I love the fact that is scales from 1-4, and from my experience, 1 would be fun, actually. I don't think the solo rules would penalize gameplay much at all. This was the potential to become an 8, but I found it fiddly, lots to move, keep track of, can be intimidating to new players at first - so many distinct pieces! Yes, the game is fairly simple and clear.

This one is tough to review. I absolutely love what this game does but the rules and special situations that can arise during play can be frustrating. I rate this high because I think this game does a lot that no other games I have played do. I really DO enjoy playing it and you cant argue that the replay value is very high due to all the scenarios. I think with more plays and becoming more comfortable with the rules this game becomes much easier to get through without referencing rule book.

An amazing game, never played a game that delivers theme and narrative as well as this one does. Choices mean something in Robinson and they come back to get you and I mean in terms of narrative not just mechanically. Incredibly well designed and illustrated. After learning the rules the game play is smooth and intuitive without sprawl of clutter that other games fall foul of. For me this stands out in my collection as being something quite special and different.

RATING: 7
Thematically one of the best cooperative game I've played. I'm still not the biggest fan of coops, but this one is certainly entertaining. It's random to a degree, yes, but most of the time it gives a great illusion of being in control of things.

I don't think it solves the alpha player syndrome as it promised, but not everything can be counted and there are enough meaningful decisions to make that there shouldn't be a single best strategy to win. At the same time, it's very thematic and you're often tempted to do things not because they're the best solutions to a given problem, but because they feel right. So we're cold on an uninhabited island, so we need to make a shelter, maybe some tools and we'll see where we go from there. 

I think it deserves all the accolades it's been given and while there are many other games I prefer to play, this one gets a high note because it's simply amazing in its genre. Still, be aware it has its issues - mainly horrible, horrible rules bloat!

EDIT: After expansion play, I'm not the biggest fan of the direction the designer has taken. Adding complexity to an already complex and fiddly game is a recipe for disaster (at least for me). Had fun while it lasted, but after twenty plays the costs (setup, amount of small rules to remember) outweight the benefits. But I still believe this is THE game for fans of strong theme and cooperation.

We need more cooperative games like this one.
Robinson Crusoe is my current 2nd favourite game and is literally a gem. Why? It makes me dive in a different world, i feel myself in a movie or a book, I am led, but not played by the game. My own decisions have much impact on what can happen next and that's rare. 
Unfortunately I have no partner with whom I can play all day, game sessions need to wait until weekend. So, I often need to play alone and Robinson Crusoe makes me forget it. No other solo game gives me more fun. 
Thank you for this game!

RATING: 10
An extremely challenging and thematic cooperative game that has only gotten better the more I play. Players can choose from one of four roles and play through one of the many scenarios included with the game. Dice and other components are of good quality and the art is gorgeous. The game does a good job of storytelling as your party attempts to complete their objective. Are you trying to get rescued? Settle down? Save another survivor? There is a lot of replayability and each experience offers something new, even if it is the same scenario.

It does take a long time to play and it is not likely you will win which makes sense, given the premise that the game is taking place in. But this can make the game a bit draining as you need to weather all of the negatives that this game and Murphy's Law throws at you. The rulebook can also add length due to having a few confusing parts and everything that happens with each phase. But after a few plays things do click and every decision makes more sense as you gain clarity on the goals and how to get there. One of the best cooperative games and one of my favorites overall.

With some games there is a problem with "hitting the table". With Robinson i have a problem to get it out of the table.

A nearly perfect game. Perhaps the best thing about Robinson Crusoe is it's ability to put you into so many different settings and still keep the theme intact. This also keeps the replay value extremely high, not to mention the brutal difficulty level. You'll really feel like you've crawled through miles of blood and dirt when you finally win a scenario.

I have mixed feelings about this game. It got a lot of hype when it came out and I really enjoyed the first few plays of it. It has a great theme and has tons of replay ability. The negatives for me include the rule book and the components. With the rules, I often find myself wondering if I'm playing correctly. With the components, I understand this is a euro co-op, but I would get so much more out of the game if it had more than just cubes to represent the different resources in the game, especially since the list price for this game is pretty high. 
I like the complexity of this game, but unfortunately because of that it's no where close to the gateway category. Players in my game group don't even mention wanting to play this during a game night. If I want to play a co-op game, I'd personally rather play Pandemic or Forbidden Desert. Despite all this, I still feel like keeping this game in my collection. I really wish I knew why that is.

I'm not rating this yet, as I don't think I've given it a fair chance.  My group of four tried to learn and play it but it proved difficult.  After several hours of playing peppered long delays trying to figure out rules we eventually decided to play something else as we have limited time.  It seemed really cool, but I got flustered with the rules.

I think to give it a fair shake, I need to watch more how to play videos and attempt it again.

Very fiddly coop, which does not offer a better experience than more streamlined coops as Pandemic or Lord of the Rings. The main mechanic is worker placement and this games feels very Euro, since you gather ressources to build things and gather food to maintain feed your people. I am no fan of much card text and there is a lot of that on the event cards. There are just to many things "active" (events, scenario conditions, traps) to keep a good overview. Still it seemed rather bloated instead of deep.

I have to deduct a whole point for the really badly written rules (German version). For example, an event card tells you to put a certain counter on the hunting deck and you go through all rules for hunting, you do not find the effect of the counter. This is somewhere else, in which all counters are discussed. At the end of the rules, there is a list of all symbols. But it is pretty much only their names, not their meanings! Those rules probably cost us a complete hour of the game.

First, this rule book is just horrible.  The components list is just about useless and trying to figure out what everything is was half the battle.  It was so horrible I almost just put it away without playing so this game takes an initial knock for that.  The quality of the cards are terrible as they are very thin and many have marks on them.  These cards will show wear further marking them since there is a ton of shuffling with the event deck.   

After, one game and trying to get past my frustration of the rules, it was a pretty good game. There is an interesting mix of long term strategy and tactical decision as events are thrown at you with a little resource management.  Choosing an initial strategy seems crucial because the game seems very tight with what you can get accomplished.  I wish it felt a little more thematic or had a little more of a storytelling feel.  Sometimes is feels a little too mechanical or euro-y which for me seemed to reduce the fun factor a bit.  This will need more plays as the other scenario goals are drastically different. The game seems to have a ton of replay-ability.  

I haven't decided if I like this game or the similar themed game Castaways more however, my initial feeling is for the latter.

Co-operative games are hard to pull off. The best are elegantly simple so that players can quickly assimilate the rules in order to focus on solving the problem the game presents together. The worst (Arkham Horror, Ghost Stories) are a bloated mess of dice rolls and fiddly rules. 
Robinson Crusoe falls somewhere in the middle. The players who had played previously were still forgetting rules and there was far too much stuff. On the other hand you could see what was going on and build a plan, and dice rolls are a choice rather than forced on you. I would certainly play again but this would appeal far more to a fan of Mice and Mystics than to someone who likes Pandemic or Hannabi.

I am really not a fan of co-operative games - almost all such games that I have ever played have left me cold. But I really enjoy this game - it does actually feel like an adventure, with lots of variability in the different scenarios and many different cards you can draw in each one. And I love the mechanic of adventure cards getting shuffled into the event deck - things that happen one day, and decisions you make, will come back to haunt you at an unknown later date.

I've only played the first 4 scenarios so far, all of them with 3 players, the first 2 also with 2 and the first several more times with 4 - and the player count makes quite a big difference (generally it seems harder the more players there are, but that's not a hard and fast rule). I'd like to try scenarios 5 and 6 at some point, although this is no longer a game I want to play all the time. I do wonder if, once all scenarios have been played and won a few times, it starts to get boring (but then my wife did get the expansion for Christmas 2014, albeit I've been less excited about the game since then and we've so far only played the first scenario of the expansion). It's a very fun game that I'll almost never turn down the chance to play.

RATING: 6.9
(+) Nice artwork, nice components
(+) Theme fits the game really well: you really feel like stranded on an abandoned island. The game doesn't really feel like a puzzle, thanks to the well thought out mechanisms and the fitting theme, the game plays out rather intuitively - but good thinking is certainly required.
(+) Different scenarios, event cards and available technologies will probably result in a big variation in game play which should ensure the game will remain interesting for a long time
(+) I kind of like the mechanism in which the ?-cards related to the actions of building, collecting or exploring sometimes can result in immediate effects but also in 'posponed' effects when they are shuffeled again in the event card deck. The different characters you can play with and the way they influence the game when they get wounded are also pretty well thought through


(-) As with all cooperative games, also this game is rather luck dependant: the cards which are drawn or the different dice which are rolled will make or break your chances of victory. Playing the game well is necessary in order to have a chance of winning, but will certainly not ensure victory. Bad dice rolls or a catastrophic card draw can feel pretty unfair.
(-) The different scenarios are nice, but they result in a number of tiny specific game rules and exceptions. The game rules may be somewhat overwhelming for some players.

Great co-op game. Lot of variety: adventures, treasures, events. One of the best part is to have a choice when making an action: do it safely or with risk. Gorgeous graphic, excellent colour palette. It's scenario based, a bonus to replayability.

They made a game about dying on an island. So I got a game about dying on an island. I've now repeatedly died on an island. (F you very much, weather dice.)

On a more serious note, this game is about reaching maximum efficiency every turn. Which can be fun. But it's not fun when I've alphaplayed the crap out of everyone at the table because they were about to make sub-optimal moves, and we still lose because of dice.

If I have to work this hard at a game, I don't want randomness to do me in 8 outta 10 times.

Seems like you might have to be a masochist to like this game is hard or hard on you. Don't know yet what I think have to get in certain kind of mood to play.

3.11.14 Im starting the game off with a 9, but it is already close to a 10 for me. The only thing that makes it a 9 right now was the amount of effort it took to learn the game. The rule book is helpful once you learn the game, but it's hard to learn directly from it.
With that the said, the game is wonderful. Hard choices, exciting events, great components, flows well (once you learn it) and lots of game play. I can't wait to play this and see if it gets to a 10 or 8 for me.

I feel as though this evokes a more thematic grounding than its descendant, First Martians, but much of the gameplay suffers in the same manner. I will say only to see my pros and cons list of my 'First Martians' rating and commentary, as they (unsurprisingly) summarize my views of 'Robinson Crusoe.'

Tenía ganas de que me gustase por la temática, el diseño y las mecánicas, pero conforme he ido jugando (hasta 10 partidas tanto en solitario como a dos jugadores) y avanzando en las misiones (he llegado hasta la cuarta) me ha ido decepcionando cada vez más. En la primera misión pasa desapercibido, pero en las siguientes te vas dando cuenta de que  el componente azar es demasiado elevado. Hay azar antes, durante y después de que el jugador realice sus acciones, lo que hace que las decisiones no sean tan importantes y que todo dependa de la suerte que uno tenga. De las 6 fases que tiene una ronda, solo en una de ellas el jugador toma decisiones, el resto consiste en mover fichas de un sitio a otro y esperar a ver qué te depara la suerte. Todo esto no sería un problema  si temáticamente fuera bueno, pero tampoco lo es especialmente. Al margen del tema de cada misión, se limita a levantar cartas que te dicen que hay una tormenta o que te ataca un animal (supongo que en una isla desierta tampoco  te puede pasar mucho más). Por último, uno de los errores que me parecen más graves en cualquier juego: las reglas tienen lagunas y son bastante mejorables, me da la impresión de que no se han analizado  las consecuencias que tienen las reglas especiales de cada misión y de algunas cartas de eventos. La idea detrás del juego me parece muy buena pero la ejecución no tanto, una lástima.

RATING: 7
This is a challenging, punishing, very procedural game that has a lot of chrome and theme. Fascinating game system that often feels like it has you in a headlock. It has a lot of set up time and has a lot of little rules to remember, so it's hard to get to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is a lot of fun to play with a group that already knows how to play the game.  It is not really a great game for a game night with friends unless you have a fair amount of time to spend explaining the rules when you have more than one new player.

Rating based on one three-player game at BGG.CON 2012.

This rating feels pretty tentative to me...further play is sure to drive it up a half a point or a point, or down a point or two.  This felt like a pretty good cooperative game, with different players' powers potentially suiting them better to certain actions than others.  In practice, though, this was closer than I prefer to the standard "multiplayer puzzle" end of the coop spectrum, where group discussion pretty much decides what each person should do.  Perhaps because the assumption is that the best moves are fairly easily calculable and that they'll be made by committee, these games almost always seem to to be set up to be only barely winnable.  I think if there was more chance of miscommunication or poor coordination among much more independently acting players, they could get away with less abusively difficult feeling scenarios.

Still, this game was flavorful, reminding me of Goldland in some ways, and didn't really drag.  And the wealth of scenarios should keep it fresh for a while.

This game is awesome. Brutal, but awesome. Just when you think things are going well and you’re about to win, the island has a way of kicking you in the head and then continuing to beat you while you’re down. It’s so tough and challenging, but I love it.

It´s a special boardgame, and which subject matter fascinates me. I love it! It´s immersive, the story is generated in your head while chasing a target in the game. Graphic design, illustrations, and the quality of the components...; EVERYTHING seems very appropiate to the theme. I wish there were more boardgames of this kind in the market, with themes based on Classical Literature, and well done like this one. It´s a pity that the rulebook is so difficult to manage: I prefer A4 size rulebooks for this kind of games, and the size of typography in some missions is very small. But above this little details, this is one of my favourites board games for sure.

[b]This review is based off the ZMan Games (old) version[/b]

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Challenging!  I like all the thinking and planning that goes into each turn.

- Some nice components - the board, scenario cards, player cards, tokens, and cubes are all great!

- Gameplay is very thematic (in fact, probably the most thematic game I've seen).  We really felt like we were trapped on an island trying to survive!  Each turn was a legitimate struggle.

- Some things are as random as the weather - which in this game makes sense.  But there are ways to help mitigate bad things.  You have choices and you can plan for the worst. 

- Even if you lose there is a scoring system so that you can see how many points you got toward your end-goal.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Rulebook layout is awful for reference!  To brush up on how to properly do a single action, I had to read several different (and often unrelated) sections on different pages to get all the info I needed.  Ultimately, I had to download 2 BGG-user-created references, read the forums, and watch a reviewer video in order to figure out how to play correctly.

- No full components list.  Really hard to tell if I had all the pieces.  Ended up having to use a BGG-user-generated document to check.

- HARD!  We rarely ever win and every turn is kinda depressing with all the bad things that happen each round.  If you hate losing constantly or you get easily frustrated/down, this game is probably not for you!

- Crappy finish on the cards in my copy.  In my copy the ink was already wearing off the edges of the cards while they were still INSIDE the wrapping. Also, several of the cards had bubbling on the surface of the cards.  Since I sleeve, neither of these became too big of an issue, but if you don't normally sleeve you may need to.

Only played one player and had a good time with it using the Castaways scenario. I would definitely like to do a 3+ player play through as I think it would be a much better experience. My knock here is that it's rather daunting to really understand how gameplay and setup works. I probably spent around 2 hours total watching videos on gameplay. Highly recommend the walkthrough posted on this site by another user. Overall though, a very satisfying experience.

RATING: 7
Finally Played this game! In Robinson Crusoe players play a group of people Stranded on a deserted island trying to survive. Players collectively must make decisions on how to survive through  6 different scenarios included in the game. Players  in the end  try to help each other survive through many hardships thrown at them. This Cooperative game adds a challenge to all players and plays up to 4 Players.

Pros: Beautiful components and artwork, group participation, Challenging Scenarios, Multiple Scenarios for variety of gameplay, Challenging decisions.

Cons: Rules heavy gameplay with no clear flow, Extremely Difficult to win, Luck based outcomes, Confusing rules definitions, Extremely heavy decisions and gameplay, Can open up problems with overpowering decision makers.

My first play was horrible!  The game probably took less time than the setup and rules explanation, despite the fact that the rulebook never stayed in the box for more than five minutes at a time.  However, despite that, I bought the game a year later.  The game is very thematic and with the feeling of plenty of options as to what to do each turn, and that outweighs the fiddliness, which after a couple of plays disappears anyway.  It has plenty of replay, and has been so fun playing through the various scenarios.  Loving it - one of my most played games in 2014 in terms of time spent playing, if not in actual plays.

Cooperation game is usually not the favorite in the eyes of many geedos. However, to me it is fine as I love the feeling of being together towards one goal. It is supposed to have tackled the problem of moron player, but still leaving behind the yet unsolved problem of 'captain decision', i.e. one leading player will make decisions for all other teammates. Themewise it is interesting.

Wanted to have this for so long, and was out of print. For so long I didn't think I would have the opportunity to have it/play it. Finally played it, and it was amazing. The difference in scenarios are great, the way you setup events and everything is randomized at setup, great replay value. You can foresee almost everything the game throws at you and prepare/minimize damages until you are able to beat the scenario.

One play. That was epic. We did not survive, but the slow death was so much fun. Well, three of us died; That bully cook was eating two food every day and laughing while we starved. He probably gained weight while we were stranded. I want to play this again right now.

And I did two days later. 2p this time, without trait cards. We survived by the skin of our teeth. A morale speech on the last night saved the day!

3p on the first scenario. Failed. We couldn't get enough wood to build the bonfire... love this game.

The more I play this game, the less I enjoy it. Although impressively thematic, I find the game way too awkward, and the constant referencing to the terrible rulebook and BGG forums makes it difficult to truly get immersed in the game.

Also, there is the tremendous frustration of the occasional "unwinnable" game state. What's the point playing a game that you literally cannot possibly win?

For me, it's mostly a great solo game (when i found time to play solo which is rare).
The difficulty is not based on a complex puzzle to solve (like in Pandemic) but more on a learning curve. Once you have beaten a scenario, you know how to solve it and mostly (lack of) luck can make you lose / win. 
For this reason, i think it doesn't work well in a group if someone knows the game (or even worse the scenario) and other don't.

RATING: 10
Robinson Crusoe sets a new standard for cooperative game design, and for that matter narrative game design. The coolest thing is that it pulls it off with worker placement and a pile of other Euro mechanics. Of course a game about survivors on a desert island would be about sending people to perform different tasks, and of course it would have to be cooperative. I'm especially impressed with how the game handles scenarios. The different contextual elements do a ton of heavy thematic lifting, making each scenario feel unique and thrilling. And I'm also a big fan of the way it manages the actual process of placing workers. You just discuss it, and put them out there. No unnecessary process, no fuss. And it's an outstanding solo game too. A terrific game, and one of the best of 2012-2013.

Kind of let down by this one. Amazing integration of theme, possibly the best I've seen, but I really felt like the gameplay fell flat. There's not really much to do each turn, and while I felt the struggle to survive, it wasn't really fun to try.

Amazing cooperative game with a super strong theme.  You simply feel you are on the island.  Hard to win the game but i´ve never enjoyed losing a game so much. Once you win however, it gives this WOOOOAAAAHHHH factor which is missing in most games. 

There is dice which add some luck factor, but again, you can decide not to use them so eliminate luck.  

Decisions you take during the game may affect you later on and this is a very neat mechanic.  

Also excellent one-player game.  Fantastic game.

Incredibly thematic, everything you do makes sense with the theme! Many different mechanics that all mesh well. There are some push your luck elements, a lot of planning, and overall a great co-op or solo experience.

Easily the best part is the stories you can tell after the fact.

Very well done for what it is and it doesn't overstay its welcome.  

It keeps pressure fairly high the entire game unlike some other  coops I've played and you feel both the desperation and hope of living on the island.  I can say exactly what I need...but will we find the right tile?  Will we make the roll if we risk it with just 1 pawn?  You aren't always certain...and I like that.  There's just enough mitigation built in so you don't feel like it just a dice fest though.

The only knock on this one is that there are lots of little fiddly rules to teach new folks.

This game is tough and I was really struggling to win the first scenario (I won 1 out of my first 7 tries) until I read about some strategies and then won two in a row.

The game can be extremely brutal and depressing as it throws problem after problem at you.  That said, I really love the theme and the game tells a great story win or lose.

I originally thought the playtime was really long but my solo games are under 2 hours now that I know the mechanics.

RATING: 6
A good, but slightly overrated co-op.
Difficult to master (good!), but sadly also very difficult to learn in the first place (bad!).
It's not enjoyable to bring this to your family or friends you just sometimes play with.
Has some other flaws, like the fact that the most important part of the board - the actual island you are on - makes up less than 10% of the space of the game, whereas a rather small part such as the tools you can build/invent makes up three times that space. That's simply not immersive (which this game strives to be).

Many other things are immersive enough though, just a little bit of role playing makes this game significantly more enjoyable.

Works well with only 1 player aswell.

tl;dr: Buy if you and/or the group you play with like to dive really deep into games, don't mind if the first 1-2 games are more to learn the game than to enjoy it, and like a really tough challenge.

Don't buy if you 1) hate losing, 2) hate co-op games, 3) have problems with complex rules, 4) search for a game to bring to your gaming group and start enjoying right from the get go.

Three plays in and this feels like a solid 8 to me. Brutal until you learn what is and isn't important. So be prepared to just get wrecked your first few games. And even then, you'll probably never feel that you were ever in control. 

Which I suppose is how you should feel when you're stranded on an island.

RATING: 9
A game of amazing depth and storytelling. Reminds me of Betrayal at the House on the Hill with the difficulty of DungeonQuest. Winning this feels like a real achievement. Having the realization that I finished a complex game and hadn't used about 2/3rds of the characters, items, story lines or rules makes me realize how many more times I can play this game without repetition. Even the box is gorgeous. The only thing that would make this a 10 is a shorter set-up time and if it came with miniatures of the characters. (easily pimped)

Immediate hit from the very first game. The perfect, thematically immersive solo adventure game. There are a lot of symbols that may be confusing at first and a bit of learning curve over the details, but the basic gameplay is easy to grasp after a few turns. The publisher and large community is awesome releasing new scenarios and other aids.

RATING: 6
Far from impressed by my first play of this. It's very fussy - lots of bits, lots of rules, excessive amounts of luck - and nothing to prevent the old co-op problem of one player telling everyone what to do. It was hard work to play for very little discernible reward in terms of fun or strategic challenge. I might try it again - but it's certainly been deleted from the wish list at the moment.

RATING: 3
This is a little better than Arkham Horror, which is all I can say for a shared RPG narrative experience. Theme, like in Mage Knight Board Game, is reduced to an accountant's wet dream. No attempt to solve dominant-leader syndrome at all, just ignoring it through complexity and theme.

Another Euro in thematic clothing. I hate how games like this purport to have theme but really douse out all the drama with too many too-cute details.

Having events come back to hurt you is nice, but why can't the cards have the same backs??

2+1

First things first - this game would probably get an initial score of 8 from me if the damn rulebook was written in clear English.  I have a big bone to pick with Portal/Ignacy about their rulesets.  Find someone who speaks Polish and can translate into clear coherent English and has a tiny amount of vision when it comes to designing a rulebook!

Rant over - Once we muddled through the rules and a couple of turns, this turned out to be pretty fun.  It's one of those games where misfortune and pain are in abundance.  I like the way morale factors in and is incorporated into the wounds as well.  You're building shelter, gathering resources and trying to survive.  I also like how you can try to do more actions, but risk dice rolls or do fewer actions, but there is less risk.  I'll definitely play this again and I may buy it, but it definitely needs a Universal Head-caliber game aid as the rules are poorly implemented as can be seen by the TWENTY page FAQ.  The rules are only 20 pages for crying out loud!!

Fortunately, the Z-Man edition of this made the rules a lot more tolerable.  The 67 page FAQ is almost a requirement to have up and ready to reference a question, but considering how wonderfully thematic this game is, it's worth the effort.  When played with the right people too, there will be high fives and genuine excitement.  Cannot recommend it enough.

RATING: 8
Love the game.  I've only played twice..lost both times, but had a great time trying to survive the island.  I really like the co-operative mechanics of the game. The stress this game invokes is something I enjoy in a game. Do I put all my tokens on one task or do I go risky and try to attempt two tasks with the possibility of not being successful and getting injured.  The stress level increases the closer you are to achieving your goals.  Did I make the right choice... aahhh.  Learning what to do or what not to do the next time I play.  My only gripe about the game are the rules.  Some of the rules are a little vague, which left me to have to come to BGG for clarification.  Although, with most games, rules are subject to interpretation by the reader.

Had a chance to play this game multiple times over the last few months with official campaigns well as with player made campaigns.  I am enthralled with cooperative games, since our group is able to allow players to make decisions for themselves without being rude.  This is my favorite cooperative game of all time.  I like it more than Pandemic, which says a lot.

Hmmm...I want to like it....I think I do when I start....but that quickly disappears.

There is just too much luck in the game. Luck of the card draw...luck of the dice.
You are often beaten before you really get going due to this factor,and this is not working for me.

Rather play something else.

#100 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

I feel like I should like this game even more than I do, given that is a co-op with some Euro feel to it. I think what keeps this one from being higher on the list is its complexity- it's almost too much. Still though, this is such a solid game. The theme shines through really well. I love that there are many different scenarios, and each has felt pretty different. We have completed the first five- I believe there are 12 in the base game, and then we have the Beagle expansion to play as well. Plenty of game left before we'd even need to replay anything!

The game is incredibly thematic and beautiful to see on the table, and we love having a cooperative game that can be punishingly difficult from time to time. The worker placement is fun, and so is trying to balance the puzzle of what you most need in order to survive. Our only complaints would be that it is just massive and has so many moving parts that it is difficult to get to the table sometimes, and that you can get super unlucky with Event cards or dice rolls (even if you mitigate them as much as possible) which can sometimes make it seem like the odds were so stacked against you that it was legitimately impossible to win the scenario. All that together does make the rare game that we win all the more satisfying.

Robinson Crusoe is one of the first cooperative games I bought and still one of my favorite games in this category. Every single game, no matter whether we lost or won, was a lot of fun. The replayability is incredibly high and the value for money one gets with the box is just incredible.

The only downside is the manual: Robinson Crusoe is a somewhat complex game and it‘s understandable that the manual is as thick as it is, but even then it could have been better. Information that should be placed side-by-side is separated and there is no alphabetical index as well as no table of context. Looking for a specific piece of information? A specific rule? Well, go ahead and browse the whole 38-page-monstrosity. As elegant, polished and fun as the game is: The manual is just as much hard-to-use. Don’t get me wrong: The actual explanations are fine … they just aren’t very well organized.
However: Once you’ve gotten a hang of it the game plays fluidly and you’ll have little reason to actually open the manual at all after two or three games, which is why the manual doesn’t really affect my rating. New players should still be aware of it and ready to invest some time before abd during their first playthrough … much more than would have been necessary with a better manual.

After all that negativity allow me to repeat what I wrote before: IMHO it’s one of the best cooperative games out there!

RATING: 9
This game has a really steep and specific learning curve but once you get through the headache of learning this game, it's super fun. It plays out more like a story than a board game. Everything you do thematically makes sense, and the game makes you feel like you're on a stranded island fighting for your life. There are a lot of cards that provide stories for exploring, building and gathering goods. Just invest the time it takes to read and understand the rule book. Once you get through that hurdle, the game will give you a bunch of scenarios and stories to experience. This is by far my favorite co-op game I own. Pandemic and forbidden desert are the other co-op games I own and Robinson Crusoe is leagues beyond those two. Theres this feeling that even after the game's finished, you just think about the stories you've created with your friends on the island.

RATING: 8
I have a love/hate relation with this game. On one hand it offers an amazing immersive experience trough the different scenarios and event cards, You really feel like you are on a cursed island and sometimes it's hard just trying to survive, but when you manage to beat the scenario you feel like you deserved it. For every game that I've played there are a couple of memorable moments, so it is one of this games that generate  stories.

On the other hand there are a lot of rules and sometimes they can even be confusing. Each scenario comes with it's own rule set and usually contradict the "normal" rules. This can also can happen with some kind of events or other bonuses. All this can force you to spend a lot of time reading the rule book or just house rule them.

Maybe without all these complicated rules and flexibility, it wouldn't be possible to offer such an amazing experience, so I still love the game and would recommend to anybody looking for a nice thematic cooperative experience.

Very meaty co-op. Great theme. Shame a little too thinky for wifey. However has good solo rules, plus being a co-op I can play solo at any player count.

Have beaten the Castaways scenario twice now, however you are very much at the mercy of the dice rolls and card draws. But then again, you are on a desert island so anything can happen!

Very good and looking forward to trying other scenarios soon.

I watched Ricky Royal's playing of this series and enjoyed the mechanics involved. So, I've added this game because it hits all the right spots. There are plenty of choices to make, deciding on what is more important, gathering, hunting, or building - and all of the sub-choices within. Of special note the flavor of the design, from map items to art really captures that stranded feel, and while the game is easy to catch on to, even after multiple playthroughs, it can still cause you to shiver and clutch your soccer ball closer in the temporary shelter. I'll certainly look to add the expansion at some point. Really a classic game!

A regény alapján készült kooperatív játékban különböző foglalkozású karakterek bőrébe bújunk. Felfedezünk, gyűjtögetünk, vadászunk, kríziseket oldunk meg és közben az időjárás is megkeseríti az életünket. Nagyon sok mindent belegyúrtak a játékba, hogy igazán változatos legyen. Sok kártya, sok lehetőség, sok körülmény. Talán kicsit több is, mint kellett volna. A tematika végülis eléggé átjön. Egy-egy új terület felfedezésével új állatok bukkannak fel, új eszközöket tudunk elkészíteni. Érdekes, hogy többfajta szkenárió van a játékban. Összességében tetszett a RCAOTCI, de nem éri el nálam a BSG és Pandemic szintjét.

I bought one of the few copies that Zman sold at Origins 2013 and I LOVE this game. It takes about 3 hours but it's so much more fun and more thematic than Pandemic. There's a myriad of decisions to make every turn and you really feel like your time is torn between a million things to do to survive. Super fun with 3 or 4 players! This game oozes theme.

How is this dominating the "Thematic" list on BGG rankings? This felt more like cooperative Stone Age than something comparable to most of the other games in that list when it comes to creating atmosphere. Could be wrong about this, maybe it's just impossible for me to get into because I find it hard to connect with cooperative games in the first place. But then again, I feel like Pandemic has more atmosphere without trying so hard.

I especially don't often enjoy cooperative games that are basically secretly single player games (where the strongest player literally has no need for his teammates), and this game does nothing to try not to be that or to change my mind. 

Also, maybe different scenarios are super different, but in the scenario I played, instead of Pandemic style coop where things get super tense super fast because you can die in an instant, this game felt like more of a slow burn, as it tried to be an epic. For someone like me who does not enjoy cooperative gameplay much, this just drags the game out and makes it less exciting than it already is.

[b]I'd Rather Play:[/b] Pandemic if I really wanted to play a cooperative like this. Battlestar Galactica if I wanted a game that uses teamwork much better as you try and deal with crisises and creates a much, much, stronger "narrative"

Remember, this is all coming from someone who already does not like cooperative games. if you are in that club as well, I wouldn't expect this to change your mind.

this game surprised me.  I thought i loved thematic games - i thought that was perhaps the most important criteria - and this one is really stuffed with it.  I was so sure i would love this game that I bought every expansion out at that time. 

But this one has very few decisions to make, each scenario has a best way to go about it, quickly discovered.  While it tells a good story, since I feel just along for the ride, after I play this solo, i can't help but think, "I'd rather have read a book."  

My son, who is the only other person i would play with this, didn't like it much either, and it wasn't that fun for us to play.

Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island is one of the most engaging games I've ever played. Despite the somewhat abstract nature of the mechanisms, the game does a fantastic job of allowing players to feel like they are on a deserted island, trying to build shelter, find food, and with a bit of luck, escape. Each scenario uses the core mechanisms to different effect, creating a totally unique experience and allowing for virtually unlimited expansion content. The rules can be a bit cumbersome to work though, but this game tells a story as well as any book or movie.

I kinda like it at first but after 3 games, I think it's really a bad game. The rules are just bad and unclear. 

It's also a simgle player game disguised as a coop game. Most coop games are like that but this one is worst than others. 

The components are of great quality though and the theme is great but the game is really below average.  

Personnaly, I'll avoid to play it again unless everyone else wants to play it.

RATING: 9
Only played it once solo... this has the potential for high rating; I'll decide once I've played it again, because it's got a lot of picky rules and fiddly to set up, but once you get going it's not that hard to play. Hard to win, for sure, but not that complicated to get into.

Maybe it's because I'm slightly burnt on it, but there are often times I'd rather play something else over this even if someone suggests it. I do really enjoy it for sure, and the various scenarios offer awesome variability, but when I sit down for a game (even a solo one), this is far from the first one I pull out.

Excellent co-op game. One of the more involved co-op games I've ever played (there's a lot going on). The production quality is amazing. I like how different the scenarios all feel. Can be prone to alpha gamer madness pretty easily though.

This game seems to be heavy in min maxing, co-op, progression, and handling tactical threats on the board.  Throw in that there are many different scenarios, and you have a nice game with ample complexity to explore.

If this was the only game I had, I'd like it a lot more. Unfortunately, I had the advantage of playing Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy and Eldritch Horror before this game. And both games execute Robinson Crusoe's mechanics better. Robinson Crusoe's encounter cards don't go far enough in terms of theme, but my biggest gripe with it is the lack of character identities and stories. They don't even have names! The scenarios can try to fill in the blanks all they want, but that doesn't change the fact that I can't see these characters as anything other than pawns.

Finally got a copy of this game, and while I have only played once so far, I am greatly impressed by it! My friends and I definitely have a lot to learn about how to make better choices early on, since despite this being the easiest scenario, it all came down to us, hanging on with our last few bits of health, starving and praying we'd survive the storm until morning for the last two logs we needed for the signal fire.

And that's what makes this a ten in my opinion. The game drew us right in, it was intense and the theme was well-realized. Excellent game!

Not as good as people say.

The more I play it the more I feel this game is unfinished, its multiple scenarios seem to have been added after the whole game was designed, therefore explaining why the whole game seems so unintuitive. This game needs to be reimagined from scratch.

Every once in a while a cooperative game comes along that steals my heart for months. Robinson Crusoe is that game. The presentation, art, and mechanics are all wonderfully integrated into a fantastic presentation that is certainly not easy to win.  There is a lot going on, but when you look at the amount of missions you get in the game and how varied everything is, you could play this for quite a while.  Great game!

Part of me is not super enamored with co-ops, so that drags the rating down a bit. I think the system is well-done and does a decent job of telling a story. It might just be that it was late when I played it and didn't get all that into it, and it certainly seems a bit long, but it just didn't grab me as much as I thought it would.

UPDATE: After another play, it's good and does tell its story pretty well, but is still just a touch longer than I'd like it to be.

RATING: 7
I'm not a huge fan of pure co-op games due to the hive-minding/forum aspect of them. This could have been mitigated, for me, if the individual characters actually got to use their unique special powers more often. 

That aside, if you genuinely enjoy the theme, co-ops, difficult situations and tough decisions then this game might be just what you're after.

It's a hurdle to work out what a lot of the symbols mean and how a lot of the game mechanics work. The explanations are poorly presented and/or not presented at all in Rulebook/FAQ.

The game itself is legendary though - I just need some handholding to get through it.  The poor layout of the rules makes me rate this lower than it actually deserves to be.

It's sort of on my to-trade list, but I'm super reluctant about it and would only trade it for something on the very top of my wants list.

This is a very nice cooperative game.  Many cooperative games can start to feel redundant no matter how good they are.  Even with a lot of variable content the game is usually played out the same way and you can start to lose interest.  Not this guy.

A lot of the usual cooperative game tropes are here.  Each player gets a unique role with special abilities at the start of the game, gameplay is carried out with action points to accomplish tasks each turn, and the game bites back by drawing from an event deck at the end of each turn.

Where this game starts to break from the pack though is in the challenges players are actually wrestling with.  Each game can be played against different scenarios such as rescuing a stranded companion, collecting resources, or escaping an erupting volcano.  And unlike games like Mansions of Madness or Legends of Andor, once you've played through a scenario I don't think this game would start to get stale playing the same scenario multiple times.  The scenarios really just make up a framework of tasks for the players to accomplish while the gameplay itself is still varied and tense.

This game is hard!  Perhaps the most difficult coop I've played to date.  There is a lot of micromanagement because players are almost always on a clock, but you still need to build shelter and cover to protect yourself from the elements, feed yourself each turn, construct weapons to hunt so feeding yourself is possible, and all while performing the tasks necessary to actually win the game.  The tension is very real, I start to feel the hopelessness of these characters stuck on the island trying to survive but for some reason it always felt fun and never frustrating.

The game also has decently good production.  Nothing that is going to blow anyone away but everything is pretty and nothing felt cheap.

This may have just become my favorite cooperative game.  Unfortunately it is already out of print just a few months after it's release in North America and owners of copies for sale are price-gouging people for 2-3 times the retail cost.  Of course I hold out hope that having sold out as fast as it did Z-Man has no choice but to reprint it in the near future.

Absolutely excellent. It's a pleasure to play it, there are enough cards to assure replayability, the quality of the design is excellent (maybe the pawns could be better).

Beware of the length of the game: with 4 players (where 2 didn't know the game, and I was doing the "master of the game") it took 3h30 to play, and we didn't reach the end because everyone was so tired.
The game is so difficult that it can be frustrating: with new players, I suggest to play rightaway with the additional support (Friday and the dog) and the starting objects. The point is to have fun: the players shouldn't have the feeling they are so far from the winning that they don't want to play until the end.

With 2 players, it's excellent: you can take the time to think, and also be less frustrated to lose, because you can think of diverse strategies, discuss more easily than with 4 players. It's my point of view.

This game needs serious streamlining and a decent manual. The FAQ & errata is 68 pages long!!! Without BGG rules discussions this game would be terrible and unplayable but with BGG its great.

But WOW what a game - so intense and fiddly. It tells stories and comes with a billion cardboard bits that you need to move about. It actually made me a bit dizzy having to keep track of everything - telling stories, trying to plan survival on the island and keeping the rules straight.

We won our second game - hurray! 
Enjoying this solo!

A very thematic game. It feels like a worker placement game, the players have to decide if they want to focus on the stuff they are doing (placing 2 'workers' on it), or if they want to attempt to do more in one round (placing only 1 worker on some places). Everywhere where players push their luck with only one worker dice decide if the task is successfull and/or if it brings any additional problems (wounds or an event connected to the task the player was doing (gathering, building or exploring)).

Events can sometimes be shuffled into the deck for daily events (simulating delayed consequences from an earlier adventure), occasinally it even depends on what the player did when he had a choise on the event card (e.g. if you find some strange berries while gathering you have the option to eat them for a small benefit, but the card will get shuffled into daily events and will ocme up later with something bad, if you don't touch them they also don't get shuffled in).

While the system is a bit fiddly it can generate really interesting stories.

The game comes with a lot of differente scenarios giving tons of replayability

Highly collaborative co-op game that doesn't feel like you're solving a math problem and is complex and varied enough to where quarterbacking isn't really a problem.

One of the most thematic games I've ever played. Because of that though, there are a ton of rules, but they are all very intuitive. For rules ambiguities, I was usually able to guess the correct rule just by asking myself "If I were in this situation in real life, what would happen/what would I do?

Finally decided to get this. Mostly intended for solo plays, but I'd be happy to try it co-op if someone would like to at some point.

Much to my own surprise, I managed to win the first scenario on my very first playthrough! EDIT: I know I played one rule incorrectly, using a build worker pawn (brown) for any kind of action. But I must have played more rules incorrectly, because I haven't come close to winning since.

UPDATE 1:
This is a seriously punishing game. Playing the first scenario solo, I'd be happy to even survive 12 rounds. Getting enough wood for the fire at the same time feels about as reasonable as expecting me to jump a skyscraper…

UPDATE 2:
I "kind of" managed to win a game today. I was playing solo, but used all four characters. I also added Friday and the dog. I used only Event cards with the book symbol. I also did not cover the Arrange Camp action with the card you're supposed to use when playing with four players, and I allowed myself two of the blue Wreckage cards to start, instead of the normal one. I also interpreted some rules I wasn't quite sure about to my own favour. For example, I'm not sure if you can lose the starting invention cards if you draw multiple cards that tell you to lose inventions.

Honestly, I feel this game is just way too ridiculously hard. I can't understand why they didn't ramp up the difficulty at least a little bit slower. There are 7 different scenarios in the game – you'd think they could at least make the introductory one not completely impossible to win in two or three plays without having to cheat…

I think the biggest problem is that even when I won (kind of), I had absolutely no feeling of satisfaction or success. I just felt that I was lucky, and that there really wasn't anything I could do to increase the likelihood of success, apart from finding ways to bend the rules.

I've lowered my rating of this from a 7 to a 4.

First the bad sides : it's convoluted, fiddly, increases the coop leader problem instead of diminishing it, the board is non functional and the rules are a mess.

Still I had great fun playing this!  It's highly thematic even if it's not really Robinson Crusoe.

Do I want to play again?  Not really.  All the people I played with felt the same.  A great experience that doesn't need to be repeated.

As someone else mentioned, this is really a multiplayer solo game.  You never feel like you play your own actions and there is nothing to manage by yourself.  I never felt like my characters with 2 actions, more like one big player with 8 actions. I'd give a better rating for solo play.

From the games I've played. I haven't played a game that is as immersive as this one. You get lost in the world that this game creates. You literally feel like you are fighting for your life. Every facet of this game is oozing with theme and realistic mechanics. It just makes sense. You go exploring by yourself? Well shoot you might just get lost and not make it back in time to protect yourself from the elements. But if you don't go by yourself or if you build a map, you mitigate the risks. Oh wait! There are otters eating your fish! If you don't kill them soon you lose a food source...This is just a small piece of the pie. There is so much you need to do but you have so little time. If you beat this game, you will just BARELY make it. I love it. People may complain about the alpha gamer complex, but this is the curse of EVERY co-op game. With that said, I think the alpha gamer complex actually spices up the role playing experience in this game. When your lives are on the line, people will not just talk civilly. There is a sense of desperation and this game brings it out so well. I only reserve to play this game with people who are truly dedicated board game fans. If Small World/Libertalia/Settlers of Catan are considered complex enough for you. Avoid this game. I would recommend Pandemic. It is a lighter cooperative game with a solid theme and also brings on the pressure. If you feel that you and a few friends want to experience something more complex and difficult then try Robinson Crusoe. You won't be disappointed. Just keep in mind that the rule book is a mess. You will need to read it carefully, and watching a playthrough on YouTube will help you immensely. Also playing a couple of 1 player games will help too. On that note this game plays excellently in 1 player mode. I enjoy having the company of Friday and a dog. Okay, I should stop before this becomes an essay. I love this game. It isn't for the faint in heart game, but for those who want to play an immersive, survival game rich in theme and challenges, I HIGHLY recommend this game.

Mature game. Maybe not as much thematic as advertised, yet many scenarios (with a room for more), randomized setup, many piles of random adventures, events, trophies etc. yields rich, replayable game. Very nice graphic layout (still, there are a few glitches, as usual in Portal games) Kudos. -.5 to rating for utterly bad rulebook.

Edit: After more plays, rating goes up. I think it is even better as I thought at first. The more I play, the more I see the game is crypto-hybrid of eurogame and role-playing/simulation game ;)

Edit 2: Acquired 2nd Polish ed. Most of glitches related to visual design has been corrected. Rulebook has been corrected. Rating penalty lifted.

Lots of interesting things going on with this game that really captures the feel. The different quests mix it up and keep it fun, although it does feel a bit too random and some aspects are a bit samey.

I hate co-ops, but this one was great, each player had different options, there were different "missions" the replay-ability of it is astounding. there was danger but it wasn't going to kill us off on turn one or two, there were some tense moments where we knew we could crash and burn, but we knew about them so it made it more intense. There was a lot of submersion into the game where pandemic feels like pushing cubes, this feels like survival on an island.
I see why this is getting a lot of hype.

Just finished my first game and I loved it!  I waited so long to be able to get this game and it lived up to my high expectations.  Didn't hurt that I won (although I probably got some rules wrong so I just consider it a learning game).  Very thematic experience with a lot of tough choices to play.  I thought this would be a great solo game but I will also try to introduce my family to it also.

First play through of the base scenario felt really good.  As a group we had so many options and were forced to discuss our options together.  I can see alpha players taking over, but that is of little concern within my normal gaming group, as we all get along well.  Excited to continue playing the other scenarios and working towards the expansion cards.

This is a very good game, the rules can be a little tricky to get to grips with on the 1st go but persevere it is worth it.  The game does have alot of bits a takes a good few mins to set up but the game is excellent and very replayable.  It is also fun to create your own scenarios as well :)

Probably my favorite game to play solo. It's very difficult and has great replayability. I recommend playing at least 2 characters because the morality system (which is integral to the game mechanics) is altered in the single character rules. The big flaw is the crappy rulebook. It's not laid out well, and furthermore it doesn't cover so many things. You will be googling questions constantly for many playthroughs. It's a little fiddly but worth learning. The random events flow together well. The decisions are meaningful. The atmosphere is there. Great game.

I find the thematic feeling great. Unfortunantely the game is constantly interrupted by the need to look up rules, only to find that the printed rules are useless, and you end up searching the BGG forum instead. I spend as much time looking for rules as I do playing the game. Extremely frustrating and it completely ruins the experience. Something is wrong when a game comes with a 20 page official FAQ, and a 59(!) page comprehensive FAQ. The entire thing should be redesigned from scratch. So sad, because it is an otherwise excellent game. Played it with my parents, and it worked really well (ie great family game). Bonus point for that!

Played it solo once, so far. Flowed nicely, liked it but it didn't thrill me somehow.

Won the Castaways scenario on the first run by far, which is something I don't like as I wonder about how challenging the game is. Must've done something wrong I guess?

[EDIT] Indeed, send out the Dog with a Map. Should've figured they wouldn't succesfully map about the whole island between them (racking in Discoveries as they went)... Should give this another try and hope I don't miss any other rule. And try with a different character than the Cook, which seemed quite powered to take on the Castaways.

[EDIT] Tried it out solo once again and though it is an ok game, still not overly thrilled yet. However, it is clear I merely scratched the surface, so I hope replays will get me enthused more for this game. The final vote is still out.

[EDIT July 2014] Another solo play, this time the Carpenter at castaways. Getting more used to the flow of the game, enabling me more to focus on what needs to be done. Pretty sure I played correct this time. As I played quicker, the game felt fresh and exciting. Won Castaways comfortably by the 11th turn but RC is starting to show it's strength: getting better at replay. Upped my rating by 1 to a solid 8 with upwards potential. Getting ready to give this a chance with my gaming group (though it might be on the heavy side for them, coming from Defenders of the Realm and Pandemic). Definitely the best heavy coop out there yet.

Robinson Crusoe: Why it is an 8:

Great Theme: One of the thrills of this game is how clearly the theme shines throughout a play.  The rewards and costs to the different actions players can take make perfect sense in the setting. At the same time, mechanics from spending extra wood on cold nights to not knowing what animals you will find if you go out hunting seem to service the theme as much as game play.  All of this is especially delightful considering the theme is a sparsely represented genre in boardgames.  

Control over negatives: Many beneficial actions introduce risk or lead to negative consequences. If you are losing lots of food to rain, well, it is because you didn't build your roof.  If you lose a turn due to illness, well, you knew it was coming, and you still didn't spend time on the cure.  If someone dies from eating bad food, well, you decided to eat that bad food. This control over what kinds of negative events occur adds an interesting puzzle allowing players to foist challenges on their future selves for the sake of immediate gratification.

Novel cost benefit analysis: The control players have over negatives mentioned above introduces an interesting psychological game; the drive to meet the goal versus the desire to avoid negative consequences. It is possible to make the players incredibly robust, with lots of food, weapons, and shelter.  Unfortunately, the goal of any particular mission usually requires the attention and resources of the players before they achieve this robustness.  This causes players to take risks, accept negative consequences they could otherwise avoid, and abandon strategies as they become too costly.  Players must constantly assess which pending problems they can afford to address, and which ones they must let slide in favor of advancing toward the goal.

Why it isn't a 9: 
I think the decision to management ratio of this game is too skewed toward the management.  This can make the game feel, particularly when tired, like moving a lot of bits around and following steps.  This isn't always the case, and there are tough decisions to be had, but they don't always take as long as running the game mechanisms that are triggered by those decisions.

Why it wouldn't be a 10 if it were a 9:
Group think:  The differences between players is very minor.  After accumulating a particular resource, which is non-transferable between characters, players unlock their special abilities.  Outside of having these resources, there is little reason to draw a distinction between players or between their characters.  On the first turn, there is no 'role' to fill.  Everyone can explore, get food, or build.  This leads to a situation where we enumerate the problems, and then we may as well mix up who does what.  This isn't always the case, but it is enough  for me to count against it.

Why do I keep trying co-ops? Because I'm still hoping to find one I really like. And this one had a ton of hype. And it's supposedly [listitem=2360681]the 7th best game to come out of last year's Essen[/listitem].
I was a bit put off by the amount of setup the game required and the amount of rules, but once that was over I was ready to try this one.
OK, so the scenario we played wasn't all that challenging, but it did show us some of what the game has on offer. 
There was quite a bit of random if-this-happens-than-flip-a-card or if-that-happens-flip-a-card-from-a-different-pile. Lots of random stuff getting flipped and triggering stuff. And as in most co-ops you team up to tackle the most pressing problems the game throws at you. It all felt quite been-there-done-that to me. It was all put together quite well but it didn't feel refreshing or new to me.
I might not be able to fully judge from this first play, but it seems to me [thing=30549][/thing] offers the same amount of fun in less time.

RATING: 6.2
Is it overlong? Yes.
Does it solve the leader problem of co-ops? No.
Is the rulebook messy and a nightmare to learn? Yes (so I'm told).
Is it Robinson Crusoe? No. There were 4 of us on the island.
Were any of the choices we had to make agonising? Yes; sort of.
Was it fun to play? It was. Of the 4 of us, 1 really liked it, I quite liked it and the other 2 both felt it ran too long for what it was.

Essentially, there is not much here that you haven't seen if you've played Pandemic (do something good, now do something bad. Repeat). The dice add an element of push-your-luck whilst allowing you to play safe but risk running out of time (actions).

It was fun, and I did enjoy it. It didn't seem to take as long as I'm told it did which is always a good sign, but I really have no need to pick this up.

Update: On a second play, I'm noticing little bits that annoy me, like how's there's no way to mark a -1 that's permanent versus one that is just for the round. Like how there are seven million little bits in the game (streamlined it isn't). It also really doesn't play any differently to all the other co-ops out there.

Rating down from 7 to 6.2.

Very good co-op game in which you're trying to survive through different scenarios. I like the deck buildning feature of the game that makes each game a unique story and in which all decisions you make might (and most often WILL) come back and mess up your life in a later turn. Very rich theme that goes well with the game engine.

OK components with a very "euroish" feel, wooden discs, cubes etc. I feel they give the game a slight "warsaw pact dullness" with the chosen colours. In a game with such a rich theme one would expect some miniatures and luxurious tokens.

Unforunately this game also confirmed my fear of co op games. I just can't help feeling like a teacher, helping all the other players with decisions and so on. I'm the biggest "gamer" of my gaming group. This leads to me not being able to immerse myself in the game and I don't have any fun.

Later, I also added the revised instructions from the re-print, sometimes reffered to as the Second Edition.

Far and away my favorite game. Theme runs very deep, tons of variety. Can run long (2hrs.) with new players, but the theme is appealing to gamers and non-gamers alike. Female representation of characters is a big plus as well. I have the expansion and all the extras as well, but plays fantastic with just the base game. I still think about different individual plays of this game often. Can't recommend this enough. Seems overwhelming at first with massive rules reading, but once you get the gameplay, is very easy to teach and set-up. Still a bear to organize all the pieces and tokens. Order an organizer with it. This is running about $200 online right now and I wouldn't even consider selling it.

  I raised my rating from an 8 to a 9 because this game just gets better the more I play it. Not easier, mind you, but better.

  It just evokes such a great feeling of being on a deserted island that you're trying to explore (without dying!), and slowly wasting away while you try to accomplish more than you can do safely.

  For some people, having the game grind you down is not for them, and I get that. But I think it's fantastic. Love Ignacy's work.

  One of my top ten of all time.

Fiendishly difficult to the point of frustration. Yet my biggest complaint is that this co-op feels very much like an overly elaborate game of solitaire with too many moving parts that add up to more chrome than substance. That's not to say there weren't parts I enjoyed. The overall theming, and especially the feeling of exploration, was lots of fun. The incidental artwork was charming even if the character drawings were atrocious -- especially the women. And the joy of flipping over a card to reveal the next part of the adventure was exciting. However, none of it added up to a game I really want to play on a regular basis. As a solitaire game, it's just too much. As a co-op, it never really felt like a shared experience. Too much chrome on top of too much difficulty on top of too much luck of the draw.

Very interesting game, I really liked the first one. We played a two-player game with Friday. And died on the 10th round of the first scenario. Still had a lot of fun. 

Two minor rules mistakes.

To me the rules seem perfectly fine (Z-Man edition, I don't know whether there's differences between editions).

At first I was skeptical because I didn't really like the topic. A scenario where people strand on an island and have to survive? That's LOST and I definitely do not want to be reminded of that #?!§ again. Since my cousin bought it, I "had" to play it in the end and I'm so glad that he bought it. I enjoyed every minute while playing the game. Working together, talking and making decision in order for everyone to survive but still progress in a way. 

Since I love the concept of crafting and worker placement, it's definitely of my favorite games.

Is a fine story-telling game that, while having some neat ideas in terms of how the scenarios play out, allows for alpha gaming to the max, feels incredibly random, and has so many moving parts that decisions feel nebulous ultimately. It's a game that I don't feel like I can ever win b/c of skill, but rather because I had four people around the table, which makes the game much easier.

Wow!  I had read the hype about this one but it still managed to blow me out of the water.

It's a highly challenging solo/co-op formed around the best implementation of worker placement that I've tried.  It also delivers what might be the best executed narrative of any game I've tried.  It has tonnes of variety, with six very different scenarios in the box (and more that can be downloaded in BGG's file section).  Gorgeous art, too -- this is one of the best-looking games I've seen.

The only aspect it falls short on is the crap rulebook, which is a poor resource for learning the game and is even worse for trying to look up specific rules.  Even the list of components was frustrating to read through.  But the obtuse and borderline incomplete rulebook isn't a dealbreaker for me.  This has the potential to be my absolute favourite game.  It's exactly in my wheelhouse.

Intriguing Cooperative Boardgame. Mixes survival and worker placement elements with a stranded on a (not so) deserted island theme. 

Slightly over-ambitious and clunky ruleset combined with a messy (English) rulebook, but doesn't stop the game from being enjoyable and entertaining, albeit slightly long which lends it too overstaying its welcome at times. Another downside is the constant book keeping and remembering what should be resulted, certainly not an intuitive game by any means.

Enjoyable. But maybe better as a solitaire game.

Wow, that rulebook! I knew going in that the rulebook was notoriously bad, so I thought I could get a pretty good handle on it. I was wrong. There are so many cards and so many special situations that come up in any single game that you're constantly having to go to the rulebook. Often times the answers are either really vague or  just not there, so you'll be spending quite a bit of time on the forums if you want to get the rules right.

Once you get past that, the game is not too bad. It does a good job of sticking to the theme and the whole element of placing two discs for a guaranteed success, or one disc for a riskier move, is pretty unique.

However, it does feel like your win or loss is mostly controlled by the luck of the cards and dice. Sometimes you feel like you're making all of the right decisions, using your special abilities to your best advantage, but you still just get destroyed by a bad roll of the weather dice or by the wrong card coming up at the wrong time.

I'm giving this a 6 for now because while it's not a great game, it's not a bad experience.

I'm biased against coop games, but this game has it's appeal. It drips with theme in a way that few games do... but it also drips with rules complexity in ways that few games do.

RATING: 9.5
The keyword here is "immersive". 

This game is very good at making every single decisions matter. it's very hard, and that's a good thing. A "good" hard cooperative games make you think and actually work for what you want to accomplish. 

The outcomes in this game will only depend on how you will deal with every situations. Are you willing to take a gamble on something in order to have more ressources? Are you willing to put all of your ressources on one action only during an entire turn just to make sure everything succeeds? It's very good at making you feel awesome when you accomplish something and terrible when you don't, but at least, you will learn from your mistakes and become a true survivor.

It's almost perfect, and I say ALMOST because there is one thing that bothered me a bit. The game didn't come with a "turn summary" which made my first plays very painful for other players since I was constantly reading the manual searching for one little thing hidden in a billion words paragraph.

Luckily, user PunTheHun made a fantastic summary sheet with everything we needed to remember during a turn, so that's awesome.

Another must own game if you are fan of cooperative games, hard games...or games in general I guess ?

I have only played the first scenario solo so far and found it to be easier to win than i first thought it would be, however because the first scenario doesn't really call for you to engage much with some of the elements of the game (the hunting deck, invention cards, special abilities) I really need to play this again and get this in front of my group. As a solo player i never really needed to worry about food, morale, and threat aspects but in a larger game i can see these mattering much much more.

*Update - Now having played a full 4 player game (we still only played the 1st scenario as they were all new to this game) I really enjoyed it, we got the win but only just and had to engage with several more mechanics than when i played solo. I still didnt find the threat actions very bad but perhaps we got lucky with our card draws. I'm looking forward to playing this again soon!

RATING: 7
This is one of those games that I appreciate more in theory than in practice.  It's a very smart piece of design, the system is very malleable and interesting.  But the game play is so tight and does not forgive any mistakes or bad luck which doesn't feel right.

It appears to be a sandbox game where you can sort of have fun with it and be creative in your decisions but you really cannot do things because you just want to do them.  You need to always take the perfect actions or take massive damage, which takes some fun out of the game.

On top of this the rules are pretty poorly written and quite clunky, which makes it more of a chore to play.

It's definitely a fun game to try but it's certainly ranked higher than it should be.

A brutal co-operative that keeps its players on the ropes from start to finish. The storytelling opportunities are rather unique, where an event takes place but is then shuffled back into the event deck, where it may come back to haunt your group.

Like many co-operative titles, Quarterbacking may become a problem with certain groups, but this felt like a natural step up in complexity from a title like Pandemic.

Gorgeous art & components. 2nd edition is the prettiest box I've owned. The difficulty balance is too knife-edge, and every single mechanic is just another way to hurt you. Depressing and draining. Character abilities feel like convoluted patches to the framework rather than interesting twists to gameplay.
The forced action order felt out of place, restricting for the sake of it.
The game is clearly designed as punishing and unrelenting, but without giving the players much empowerment - only resignation that their slow death is the probable outcome. Take the dog to ease the pain - he'll outlive you.

RATING: 8
A Modern Boardgame design, another sign of the future of boardgames. Combines the elements of the retro "Ameritrash" and "Eurogame" categories into an immersive yet strategic cooperative game.

Good flow of play, a plethora of choices, absolutely great sense of accomplishment, tough risk assessment, layers upon layers of theme and narration, amazing replayability, manageable luck.. Really this game does so many things great that it really seems like an instant classic. In addition this game takes one of my favorite mechanics, events that trigger with a delay, and boosts it up to venus.

On the downside there is the classic Alpha Player problem of several co-op games. I don't really see an in-game way to deal with this (one player dominating the others and ordering them around), other than the amount of choices that call for many brains to smoothly plan for them. Player groups that have this problem will like the experience, but not the game. In addition, the game really is a bit fiddly in practice, but not to the point of frustration.

Overall this game is a blast, especially for co-op lovers (like me!), and even co-op haters might find this engaging enough to enjoy. It's one of those games that leave an instant mark and you might catch yourself thinking about it hours after your play, and its narrative may well survive to become a point of discussion long after the gaming session is over.

I had heard that this game was insanely hard.  And I can certainly see how things could go wrong very quickly.  We were fairly lucky and managed to sail through the introductory scenario without too much of an issue.

I enjoyed the game a lot.  There's not a lot you get to do on your turn, and there's usually more that you want to do than can get done.  Which means that you'll want to work with your team and try to make sure everybody's on the same page in terms of what should get done.  What I really liked about the game was the narrative that we built around the game.  For example, our accident prone explorer insisted on crafting most of the game, and managed to fail to build anything three times out of four (but boy was he determined, ha get it?, to build that map!)  

I also like that there are various scenarios and that repeat plays will have different objectives and will play out very differently.  I'm already looking forward to trying a different scenario.

OK.  This game is something.  Wow, the instructions almost left me more confused.  It took about four reads before I could try to play without constantly looking at the rulebook.  There are some great cheat sheets on BGG that really make the game more smooth.  One you get the flow of the game, it makes for a great game.  It is very challenging even on the first 'castaways' scenario.  However, I strived to beat it and would actually play games back to back to try to beat it until I did...once so far as solo, and once barely with two players WITH the dog and Friday.  It is an addicting game with pretty cool choices and a great theme.  I also like the fact that there are no 'real' turns for players.  Players discuss on what to do together and place their pawns in those locations.  Makes it where you can theme the game to new players very easily.  As long as the game master doesn't control the game and plays it as "We just crashed and this may be what is coming, what should we do?" type of game master...it should be fun for all.  UPDATE:  The more I play this game, the more I like it.  The theme has really jumped out at me now, and I just love how things like cuts and scrapes will get worse with time unless you have a cure, etc... I now am playing with the beagle expansion and just love it...even though it is hard, I enjoy the challenge.  It has been on my table for days set up and it is not being put away anytime soon.

Self-flagellation gamified. The game successfully captures the desperation of slowly starving to death stranded on a desert island. An overwhelming oppressive narrative develops as nearly every game event has a net-negative outcome. Survival can be delightful, but losing after three hours of play is near unforgivable. Additionally, the game is overly fiddly with too much board management and promises a sense of adventure and discovery that it fails to deliver. I'd rather be on Gilligan's Island.

Very good thematic co-op. I have played a couple of games so far. 2-player with Friday seems a lot easier than a 3-player game. The event/encounter system is innovative and works very well. This mechanic will be reused in a lot of games. I've played the Z-Man edition. It's has some cards and some things in the rulebook that is hard to interpret.I guess some things got lost in translation. Since the theme and actions in the game is very non-abstract my kids were able to play it with me doing the mechanics and they made the choices.

I think this is an awesome game that I don't enjoy playing all that much , if that makes any sense. The mechanics are super solid, but the punishing difficulty tends to strip away some of the fun. I used to like it more than I do now. The last few times I've played it I just became frustrated. Great game, but I think I'm done with it.

The most interesting part of Robinson Crusoe was the hour or so it took to set it up. It is a large game with lots of cards and bits to sort through and figure out. From there it is punishing and brutal. It failed to capture my group's imagination. After a couple rounds we decided to abandon this one on a deserted island.

So I can understand the hype behind this cooperative game. It is both flavorful and thematic to the core. A throughly enjoyable design by Ignacy and one that deserves a high rating based on a few plays. However, like all text-heavy co-op games, repeated plays will likely reduce the score since as more text cards are explored, the novelty will wear off. The scenarios however, are quite rich and will provide a variety of challenges for many years to come.

The game features obstacles and hurdles coming from exploration, hunting and surviving the island enroute to achieving specific victory conditions. I find that the game balance is quite exquisite and a few crucial missteps may cause players to lose the game. However, careful planning and repeated plays will probably reveal some basic strategies for surviving the island.

A couple of novel mechanisms: Dual use cards akin to "choose-your-own-adventure" cards where picking a beneficial short-term reward may lead to a negative outcome further down the road. Love the risk-reward mechanism coupled with action selection where doubling your action prevents risk.

A great game design and worthy of some gaming awards

very good work from the designer of stronghold.
it unfolds a live adventure in front of your eyes
simple and nice mechanics too.
The only thing i kinda dislike is the random weather changes which i cant explain thematically to myself
but who cares the game is brilliant!
the game is TOO tough to win.
until now the greatest and best cooperative game.
and very good solo by the way.
really really  fun game!

An incredibly thematic struggle for survival. 4 plays and I haven't won the first scenario yet - I have few fears over replayability!

I could play this as a 2 player but it's too good solo so I'm keeping it to myself! Raised to a 10 after 4 plays.

Dropped back to a 9 after 9 plays because it really is a bit gruelling being continually beaten upon, I wish it was just a tad easier. But still a fab game!

Fantastic co-op that captures the feel of the genre beautifully. As a kid I loved reading Robinson Crusoe, Swiss Family Robinson and all the others - and this game taps right into those memories. 
Graphic design is beautiful, and the board has a map-like, castaway diary feel that is a pleasure to look at. 
My only gripe is the jarring illustrations on the character cards: why, when the rest of the game is so thematic, do the characters resemble steampunk rejects from the 19th century? Pith helmets, goggles and repeaters? Come on guys - disappointing band-wagon jumping. If this post ever gets read by the designers, PLEASE include replacement cards in an expansion.

This game doesn't exactly kill the Alpha player, since an experienced player will still have a 'better' idea of what the right decision is at any given moment.

Amazing game with tons of replayability. I really think this mirrors my feeling in Agricola very well, there is just so many things you'd like to do but never enough time to do them. 

Add in the challenge that if you want to do more actions you can gamble by sending one pawn rather than two. You might get an additional thing done, or you might not get anything done. Compelling stories to tell!

Hardly scratched the surface and there is still so much more to try.

I finally figured out what I don't like about Robinson Crusoe. It's a fine game, but it's just not for me. I think it makes the opposite move that Mage Knight does.

Mage Knight takes the Ameritrashy adventuring-hero-slaughters-monsters conceit but replaces the heart of its gameplay with a Euro-ish deck-builder-resource-management-thinky-thinky game. I love that.

Robinson Crusoe takes the Euro resource-gathering-worker-placement conceit but replaces the heart of its gameplay to with an Ameritrashy throw-dice-press-your-luck-draw-cards-risky-risky game. Meh, not what I want. When I want to go AT, I'll go all out with something like Eldritch Horror.

Strongly thematic gameplay is held back by a little too much fiddliness and too many vague rules/gameplay situations.

This game is amazing! It is -by far- the best coop game I've played! It also is the best Solo game I've played!
Once you digest the rules (which is the hard part), it is dripping with theme, the mechanics are superb, the tension can be overwhelming.

The 6 base Scenarios offer 6 very different experiences, as does the number of Characters used: 4 characters offer a lot of options BUT require a lot of resources for building and feeding! on the other hand with 1 or 2 characters, you have so few actions available that every single choice you make is critical!

More than a game, it is a story generator (Archipelago does that to a lesser extend). Depending on the first Events you draw as well as the first Island Tiles revealed, the same Scenario can/must be played very differently from one session to another.

I've been playing this game non-stop since I got it, I have beaten the first 5 scenarios at least twice, I'm close to a 50/50 win/loss track record BUT I still have not beaten the 6th (survived with the family but could not build all 9 items); I still have 3 additional scenarios to try and I am currently working on my own Scenarios (LOST-themed)!
Once again, amazing game!

update: I have now played and beaten every scenarios, including King Kong, the Naturalist, Leviathan's defeat, Zombie Island, Dino Island, Fallout.
update: also Livigstone, HMS Baikou, Hunters, LOST.
Now I need the French version of Voyage of the Beagle!

[+] everything is top-notch: theme, mechanics, replayability, components
[-] lots of rules to digest

I like this game.  As far as co-ops, it's one of my favorites.  It's nice that it's a little bit heavier than most of the cooperative alternatives.  This does have a bit of the "game plays you" feeling that can dog cooperative games, but it's minimized by the fact that there's no railroad track to victory, and the different scenarios make different things important.  The components and art are truly fantastic.

I'm amazed by how much I love this game despite how punishing it can be. I have had so many plays when everything went so well till the mid-game; when I was thinking to myself, I got this, only to draw a card that sent me on a downward spiral. The theme of fending for oneself on a forgotten island is very strong, the mechanics are sound. If you can handle a game where everything seems to have joined forces to annihilate you, you should try it and die trying. Also works very well as a solo game.

I like it and it's a fun cooperative game but I bought it because I heard how hard it is. The Dice Tower guys say they've never beat it. I have played it twice and we won both times. I discovered we sorta cheated on the Castaways scenario but I think we still would have won. But then we beat the Cursed Island scenario without too much trouble. What are we doing wrong?

UPDATE:

Despite multiple attempts, we cannot get past the Volcano Island. This game is very challenging. We play it when we want to feel stupid. Love it though!

Was bored of it after 3 plays. Cool theme. I can see why a lot of people would like this game. But really, it gets boring (for me) because no matter what choices are made, there is very little way to mitigate luck. If you play safe enough to not die, you struggle to beat the scenario objectives. If you play to get the scenario objectives, you die from not playing safe enough. In the end, striking that balance between the two is pretty simple but then it just comes down to a crap shoot of card draws and dice rolls. Thus it feels like meaningful decisions are few and easily made.

A mix of WP and coop which is why I probably don't hate it. The theme is very well done and maybe that's why this game doesn't feel as contrived as some other coops where you're playing "against" the game but don't feel invested. Maybe I just really like Robinson Crusoe. It's nice that there are a variety of scenarios and the teamwork is fun. You are actually working together. This is the first coop I've actually enjoyed. A touch on the long side but nice for a weekend.

Very good game, thematic, difficult in a proper level, really brings you into the mood of being a castaway. The only disadvantages I could say is the ambiguities in the rules (even if I have the new edition and the rules have become much better than the previous edition, still there are some ambiguities that you will encounter during play) and even the fact that there are a lot of event cards, gather, build and explore and mystery cards, the fact that there are 7 scenarios only, minimizes the replayability a little bit. These are the only reasons that the rating is still under 9. But in case I play it more and see that I still want to play it, the rating will raise.

Totally unique coop game. All about optimization and intuitive handling of events. The obligatory randomness of the event deck gets straightened out a bit by the cool mechanic wherein every event has a follow-up, of which you know it is going to come out, but you don't know when. Adds a lot of tension to the game, but the game still suffers from deterministic action taking sometimes.

RATING: 9
I think this might be the pinnacle of co-op games. The system is so robust that even though every scenario uses the exact same mechanisms, each one feels completely unique. Even replays of the same scenario rarely repeat their narrative. The highlight is the encounter system that not only forces you to make a difficult decision when it triggers, but then makes you deal with the consequences of that decision a second time when it pops up again in the event deck. It's incredibly clever and extremely immersive. 

The rulebook is a mess and there are still a few unresolved issues the FAQ hasn't addressed, but it's nothing that can't be worked around. Trust me, it's worth the effort...Adventure awaits!

Do not waste your time. Another poorly designed game by Ignacy Trzewiczek
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Short version is that this is good for what it is but not my thing.

I have to really love a game to put up with as many bits as this one has. Rules were also not entirely clear until we started - I think this is one of those that's harder to get your head around than the complexity would imply (like trying to learn Race for the Galaxy if you haven't played Puerto Rico or San Juan).

Obviously co-op games need something to prevent one player from bossing the others around. This game achieves that through randomness, and as a result, you have to play very reactively. I found myself unable to plan very effectively more than half a turn or so in advance. As far as reactive games go, this is one of the better ones I've played (though not on the level of, say, Battlestar Galactica) - but I found it very frustrating, even though we won. I felt like the dice going our way were a larger component in our victory than our choices, and I don't like that feeling.

Then again, I'm already predisposed against co-ops. I'd rather play this again than, say, Ghost Stories, so take that for what it's worth.

Great co-op game, it tells a superb story, and judging by the adventures it's a nicely open system. Just wish there were a few more options during the game to give a bit more flexibility.

This could have been a better game... What kills this game for me and my friends (and we like coops!) is the unrelenting monotony of the bad event cards in the Event deck. The fact that there is never a single moment of relief kills the game experience and enjoyment for us. I totally agree with Rahdo, who said that the difficulty of the atmospheric coop games should be much more like a rollercoaster ride, rather then a numbingly dull descent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=BLX9_RX6R24#t=1965 32:45

RATING: N/A
Structurally interesting but not all that original. Lots of built-in variability, at least superficially. Rules are curiously over- and under-written, and hopeless for a quick-start first game. I find the graphics muddy and amateurish, but they are thematic, I suppose.

It does not address the play-by-committee or alpha player problem at all, despite the designer's protestations to the contrary. In fact, given the complexity and the tightness/difficulty, this is a problem child on that score.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good coop, but doesn't try to solve the "alpha player" problem at all.

Because of that, I think it's probably best with 2-3.  Much more than that, you'd probably end up with one or two people who aren't really actively engaging with it.

This is a coop-game I realy, realy like. It takes your imagination all the way. It does require some patience to fully grasp all the rules and trying to explain them is not an easy task, but from than on you get sucked into all sorts of scenarios and adventures for many plays to come. The replayability is huge and one of the very strong points of the game. Best coop I played by far!

Robinson is perfect for me. People have many problems with this like randomness, high difficulty and complicated. I admitt that i can't fully understand why I enjoy this game so much and I'm blind for all these disadvanteges or see some of as good things. Randemnss in many cooperative games is higher and these games are still very popular. Maybe it's only me but in Robinson crusoe I always feel that I deserved success or loss, and random events and in fact everything in this game make it feels like real adventure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game simply tells an amazing story and provides a great sense of adventure. Robinson Crusoe is the most evocative and exciting cooperative game I've played so far, it's absolutely brilliant.

The number of unclear rules in the original manual used to drive me crazy, but forunately the 2nd English edition has new, revised rulebook (kudos to Paul Grogan!) so I highly recommend getting one (or at least downloading it from Portal website). Now I don't have any issues with the game whatsoever.

This game offers a very cutthroat and tight coop experience for strategic gamers; it also offers a very immersive storytelling experience through a clever implementation of the adventure decks. It excels Pandemic + On the Brink in many aspects.

After you learn the basics from scenario 1, however, only scenario 6 seems to reach the game's full potential. Scenarios 2-3 are too easy, and 4-5 are fiddly. I feel that there is a lot of room for improvement, through 1) new scenarios, 2) a mobile app handling adventures, or 3) more diversity in inventions.

If this game wasn't so fiddley and complicated I might rate it higher. It is so difficult and satisfying to play, I just don't like the 50 upkeep steps every round. I recently lowered the score 2 full points. I played a few games now and on more than one occasion I have lost a game in 2 rounds through no fault of my own (other than rolling 2 wound die). The cannibal scenario can be really imbalanced if you draw several of the book symbol event cards at the very beginning. I drew the one with 2 books on it and that basically takes you down half of your total life.

I'm torn with this one.

Very complicated, without meaningful gain in return.
Multi-player puzzle. You don't take your turn, but the group as a whole discusses each turn in detail.
Too many random effects. Many stacks of cards, and if that wasn't enough, a good number of dice rolls.
Too long. Too long to setup.
Bad rule book (german version).

Awesome and brutal game. You have so many options and so many choices to make. It's really good. The one thing I don't like about it is how the game has little cubes to represent everything. You're supposed to be on this island, creating all sorts of new contraptions, exploring different areas and then you have stuff represented by cubes. It just pulls me out of the game. You can buy some AWESOME replacements that people make online, but that doubles the price of the game.

Excellent game though.

Survive the island's onslaught of natural perils by desperately coordinating efforts to scrape together the basics to sustain us while trying to accomplish our goals.  It is relentless and luck factor is completely out of your control, but so far that only fuels our determination to beat this game.  My concern is the limited story objectives, but we are still trying to conquer the first one so maybe that is not a problem.  I'm told BGG members have written some in the forums.

Great thematic co-op game. Plays great solo thanks to the Dog and Friday character pawns and their limited powers. Included scenarios are challenging and will provide many plays before wearing out. Traded because Eldritch Horror fills the need for a longer, thematic co-op.

It's a good game. Original, and nice to play. It can get very difficult and challenging wich is a good thing. It lacks clarity in the rules, graphic design and symbols, however, and to me, all the different items and itsyfitsy bits reduce the game's elegance. I like Euro-style games, but compared to for instance Agricola, or Frisian Fields, this game feels messy.

There are few designers who take pleasure in crafting overwrought games with freakishly bad rulebooks, but Iggy T is definitely one of them. 

I mean, what other game has spawned multiple comprehensive FAQs that are 20 to 60 pages long? Besides [i]Stronghold[/i], that is, the designer's other muddled disappointment.

In the Castaways scenario, I loved my brush with gangrene and our feverish destruction of a charging ape.  But that was only 1% of our gaming experience, with the rest consisting of listless debate of where to place our wooden cylinders.

Next time, more gangrene and less wood.  Please.

Good cooperative game because everyone usually has a more good things to do than actions so there is no optimal move that the "pushy" co-player will try to talk you into doing.

This is my favorite game right now.  I cant imagine how long it took to play test a game that is both tightly tuned and yet plays like an open ended adventure.  

Mad props to Ignacy, his team, and all of the people who play tested this.

There are other games that I really like for other reasons, but this one is the most fun I've ever had while thinking really hard and often losing at a board game.

I've played four games now (won 2, lost 2, all outcomes very close.)  9 rating is conservative.  I dont like to hand out 10s and I'm waiting to see if there's a reason it shouldnt be a 10.  My only complaint is that the rules could be better organized - I dont even think that many of the ambiguity complaints are warranted for the most part, information is just not ideally organized in the rulebook making it very easy to miss rules that make critical distinctions. Fortunately we have a horde of BGGers helping each other figure it out.

10/26 - some scenarios are more fun and have more replayability than others.  Not everyone likes the feeling of struggling on an island and some people think its too fiddly for what you end up "doing."  I dont have that problem.  I love the game and will play solo when I dont have anyone else to play with.

Sticking with 9 rating.

Big game with lots of stuff, and a load of bits. But it isn't all used at once, and is all logical and there to help you keep track of things with a minimum of fuss. The actual game is hard, but makes sense, and you can figure out what to do logically then apply it to the game, which helps. Loads of variety in setup, and the 6 scenarios (plus others downloadable) give a lot more replayability than appears - it's highly unlikely you'll complete any successfully first time, and if you do... well, let's see you do it again! It is full of little choices, and does need planning & micromanagement, as well as lots of moving bits around the board, which some find annoying.

There's also assistance built in for solo play.

We tried it once with a too big group (4 players) with no real hardcore gamers. Nobody played the game before, so it was quite agonizing to start playing this game. It took us more then 1 hour to get an idea of the game and then everybody already got so bored and annoyed we stopped trying.

The theme and artwork is great, but the rulebook is a mess and makes the game much harder / confusing then it should be.

RATING: 8
I have only played this game twice solo on the first scenario but I thoroughly enjoy it. Unlike other games that I've played (other than Mage Knight) that say they can be played solo, this game feels like it's been designed that way and isn't some sort of variant that's been tacked on. 

The game is full of tough choices and doesn't seem like it would ever lose its replay value. Having 6 difference scenarios, a number of different characters with their own unique abilities and the sheer randomness of the cards, tiles, etc... I don't think that you could ever get bored. All of the components are beautifully designed and are of high quality too.

Like most coop games where the players are fighting the game itself... it's very punishing. There are also quite a few little rules to take in to account and the sequence of events is important to remember. Most of the systemic concerns I believe would disappear the more comfortable I became with the game. Only having played it twice now and pretty much a year apart, I think that I should get a couple more games in soon to really get the game down and then see what the other people in my group think. We don't tend to play co-ops, but this is something that they've seemed interested in in the past, so I might as well see what they think. If, at the end of the day, they don't enjoy it, I don't think that I'd ever get rid of it because I can already tell that it's a solid system and game. Its rating should only climb as I play it more.

A very thematic cooperative worker-placement game, where you play as survivors on an island that is trying everything it can do to kill your group.
It's an excellent game with a ton of stuff going on. There are more or less only four main actions that your workers can do, but everytime these play out very differently and make for a really interesting, very enthralling game that tells exciting stories. You never know what the island is going to hit you with next and there could be danger or treasures under each card, leading to very involved discussions between players when planning the next turn.

Very fun game and my favorite co-op. Varied scenarios combine with interesting actions and random setup to create a pretty unique experience each time. Also the storytelling actually makes sense in this game as opposed to the Arkham/Eldritch style of forced/"disconnected from gameplay" storytelling.

Production quality is lacking for the MSRP. Wooden cubes are generic, the plastic cubes feel cheap and the wooden discs should've had the character art engraved in them with a price like this.

Almost always get destroyed but I love this game. Highly thematic and once you get the steps down, the turns flow very smoothly. Out of many plays, I've only beaten the first scenario once as a 2p.

RATING: 8
I'd say the feel of this game is right between Pandemic (strong planning for next turn and seeing where likely trouble will occur) and Ghost Stories (sometimes needing to rely on the dice to succeed and you get kicked in the head from random directions a lot too)... so its pretty darn good.  The story scenarios seems like a lot of fun to explore and with those huge decks of cards I doubt this ever feels all that samey.  Gwen wants to see the components first... but I think we might be adding this to our collection.

Kooperacja przygodowa ze scenariuszami. Gracze: 1-4 Tłumaczenie: średnio, da się grać z osobą która ogarnia. Wymagania: cierpliwość i niezłomność. Czas: 3h + 1/3h per os.

Dużo klimatu - motyw rozbitków z epoki powieści Robinson Crusoe. Bywa trudna, trochę trwa. Ma sporo zasad, ale nie trzeba ich znać na pamięć, jeśli jest jedna osoba, która je zna. Brak downtime'u.

An amazing co op game. Very hard to win

The Good:
-The theme is so integrated in the mechanisms.
-The story is so immersive
-I love the planning. You really have to work together.
-The game feels like you are struggling to survive
-The event mechanism is one of my favorite mechanisms of all time.
-High replay value
-Some humor in this

The Bad:
-The rulebook(I think the new edition has fixed that)
-Very hard. So if you don't like games that are very hard, stay away.

Very nice game with good components, beautiful artwork and interesting theme! The rulebook is quite long, but well written and exhaustive.
After a few turns the game mechanics became easier, but the game is still quite difficult (but not impossible) to win.
It always gives you that feeling of not being able to do all the things that you need (which matches perfectly the theme), but it's also very rewarding when you finally make it to your goal!

RATING: 7
Seems a bit overhyped.  So far, scenarios seem pretty hard - maybe so hard that luck of the roll/draw becomes as important as strategy.  I don't mind a challenge, but the game seems to be just one bad thing after another and after a while that pain reduces some of the fun.

I think Castaways is a better game than this one because it is more fun to play and its theme and story is just as rich.

Ugyan még csak egy játék volt és a fele a szabállyal ment el, de eddig nagyon tetszik.
Jók a mechanikák és szuper ötletek vannak benne, minden adott a nagybetűs szórakozáshoz. Az ötletes forgatókönyvek miatt jó darabig nem fogunk unatkozni.

Played two games of scenario 1 back to back ...lost both :-) however I am completely hooked by this game! Gather wood and food, survive the night build a shelter and try to stockpile wood all with far too few actions, it is great fun and requires a mixture of luck and adaptability of playing style. I particularly enjoy the adventure cards that get shuffled back into the event deck lurking there ready to scupper your plans at any moment, building tension as the game progresses.

update 02 Sept 2013: after 4 more plays we finally beat scenario 1. We then tried Scenario 2 and died very quickly:-) I highly recommend this game. Everyone should have a go at playing it at least once.

....Someone should definitely make a Cthulhu inspired ^^^/;,;/^^^scenario... oh wait Arkham horror :-)

After almost 2 years i played it again with the new rulebook. It still feels thematic and exciting but at the same time more random than i'd ideally prefer. I definitely want to play it more but only multiplayer. I think i'm pretty done with the solo play with this one. Dunno. But still an excellent and unique coop.

Probably the most thematic game of my entire collection (250+ games). Robinson Crusoe is an enjoyable experience, but there are too many rule ambiguities to consider this game a masterpiece. I have spent more time in the rulebook or on this forum than actually playing the game. 

  Also, the box states that it plays in 2 hours, but expect 3-4 hours for your first plays (even solitaire).

This is a coop where the theme blends perfectly with the gameplay. The atmosphere of being castaways breathes throughout the game and a story unfolds in each play. 
The luck in this game is containable. You can take risks and push your luck, but you always have the option to play safe. The event and action cards never seem unfair and even give you a decision. You can take the benefits now and worry about the consequences later when the cards comes back. The dice don't feel unfair either since you can spend earned tokens to reroll. 
The teamplay is very prone to alpha players giving orders or directions. But you can always make your own decision or discuss the group plan. You never feel forced nor have the feeling the game demands You to take a certain actions, it instead demands that the Group takes actions to survive. The experience becomes better with fewer players, or when all players are equally familiar with the rules and gameflow. 
There is a lot of variation due to the different scenario's. Balance: the first scenario is too easy with 4 players. And that's bad since the game thrives on the feeling of survival and thus needs to be hard to evoke that feeling. The game is very moddable, it provides a game system and you can create your own scenario's. The game is also great for solo play.

Une fois les regles lues et intégrées (ouf!!), 
Première parties : très difficile et cuisant echec mais le jeu est fluide et prenant.
Encore quelques coup d'oeil au livre de règles, l'impression qu'il n'y a pas tout dedans (les blessure des personnages)
Tout de même impatient de recommencé une partie

Extremely thematic, but very complicated and the rules don't do the best job of teaching it. It took us three games to even be sure we were playing it correctly. Even once you get the rules correct, it is very difficult, which I think is a positive but others might find frustrating as it is very punishing and unforgiving. You really have to struggle and work together to survive, taking chances which may or may not pay off.

2/5/14 -- Half a solo play in and, frankly, I got a little bored.  Of course, I was still learning the rules and I have the attention span of a gnat these days, so make of that what you will.  It seems the game missed some opportunities to reinforce the theme, favoring instead abstract procedure.  For example, the weapons track?  What is this representing, how many spears I've made?  The events et al seem a little bit dry, e.g. a storm happened, take a wound.  Uhhh, OK.

But it's far too soon for a well-formed opinion.  I'll probably try pulling it out for BrianCon '14, wherein it will have the best chance for success.

I love how this handles its random element: you never technically *have* to roll dice; but taking calculated risks can be very beneficial.

I also love its storytelling element. Adding encounter cards to the event deck based on your choices is really brilliant.

It's longer than what I typically like but it does a lot really well.

Very impressive thematic/strategy mixture. I really enjoy the brutal difficulty and balance between luck and effective play. Robinson Crusoe seems to be a game that you can win or lose when playing well but simply cannot win when playing poorly. It requires you to learn its inner workings, plume strategic depths, and experiment with new plans. All the while it's cackling in the corner with devious intent. Let's see if its measly 6 scenarios can stand the test of time.

For me, this is the best co-op out there. Superb theme and a harsh island where you really have to fight for survival. Some brilliant mechanics in there too, and 6 scenarios in the box to keep things fresh. This is also much less of a 'puzzle' than Pandemic is too. Thumbs up.

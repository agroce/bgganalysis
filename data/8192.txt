RATING: 5
Badly written rules, so it's hard to say but it seemed mildly broken - 2 hours to play and it was too easy for the game to end in a tie. Fiddly, long waits between turns, but definitely an interesting system, so I have mixed feelings about this one. I'd like to try a finished / fixed game of this some time.

1 4 player game. the dice supply dried up before the game had really begun. I might try again with 3 players, so far this was (surprise, surprise) quite dicefesty, with 3 the game would probably last long enough to see if there are meaningful decisions beside the dice casting. I wonder if it wouldn't be less then 5 if it wasn't a train game... :-)

RATING: 9
Rating improves after realizing the runaway leader problem doesn't really exist. This is a very subtle game with tough choices thinly masked by the handfuls of dice being rolled. There is a superficial resemblance to a sort of "18xx lite" but this will get 18xx players in trouble...

Played only with the SoS variant in which VPs are awarded only for construction, not as a per-turn thing.

Quirky enough to warrant playing, it can get a little long, but still interesting. Extremely tactical, of course.

1 play, 2 players.  Possibly played incorrectly since switching the start player in the 2 player game meant that each player had 2 turns in a row.  Aside from this, the mechanisms are interesting... but the turns can take a long time with all of the bonus "?" dice that you can produce in daisy-chain fashion.  Mainly, I dislike the fact that the tile edges must match... we ended up with one huge, never-ending mountain range.  Note: it's probably best to keep the 2 expanding ends of the rail line as far apart as possible to avoid the never-ending mountain problem and give the grassland and lake railroads a chance.

It has some cool, unique game play elements.  I enjoy determining how to maximize my position each turn based on the roll of the dice, but it isn't that simple, which makes the game drag out longer than I like.  It also has a runaway leader problem.  I'll play it occasionally, but it isn't a favorite.

If you have the v2.0 rules and are having trouble understanding how to play, check out the v1.2 rules from the download section of the Railroad Dice web site.  They are more verbose and I found them easier to understand.

The dice management aspect is pretty interesting, but the game ultimately falls flat.  The stock just doesn't seem right, even though we played with a recommended fix (the rules, as written can result in a huge runaway leader problem).  Once you can buy shares directly from the current owner of a company, you've essentially locked that company for yourself for the next turn, as nobody can then buy the shares from you (until the next turn).  I really wish I could like this one, but the novel concept just isn't enough to save it.

This is a great and very novel game!  It took a play-through to understand the rules properly, but it was interesting.  There was some luck from the roll of the dice, but it was mitigated by the various methods of gaining bonus (joker) dice that could be used any way you wanted.  Very strategic and definitely wicked with the rules allowing for takeovers of others' companies (along with the stations they worked so hard to build).

Only played with two, but had a lot of fun during playing.  Very novel concepts!  I will echo the comment, however, that catching up to the leader can be nearly impossible.  Still, that doesn't make this a bad game.  Settlers of Catan is held in very high regard (rightly so), but also has this very problem.  The mechanics are great.  I could really see this emulated in other games.

RATING: 7
RR Dice offers players an opportunity to invest in 5 companies who each have a certain requirement for placing their terminals. The goal of the game is to create lines of terminals on each square of the board (sort of like Taj Mahal's palace chains, except they score every round). The game is driven by dice, which show either curved or straight track, stock, or a wild side. Players need to have a majority stake in a company to place stations and increase their income, but raids are regular, and being early in the order can make you the victim of a hostile take-over in short order.

The overall flow of play seems to focus on trying to pull off long turns by building stations and track carefully. This is partially driven by dice-rolling skills, but it is more a function of careful planning because bonus wild dice are given out for both moving the action to a new tile, and for creating stations, both of which should be options on most turns for the cagey player. Knowing when to give up on a company, when to loot the leader, and when to spend some dice to leave the next player in a tough spot were all aspects of this that I found interesting.

There are a few weird things here, like the way the board works (essentially, play is on two large boards, which come from a stack of 3 terrain types, and these keep being cleared while the "world board" is shown on small Carc size tiles) which make the game a bit hard to wrap your head around at first, but I think making the effort is time well spent.

The only real niggle I have is the stock system, but it's a big one. Players just invest in stock in the early going until enough stuff has sold out and then it's possible to filch stocks from the other players. The individual stocks mean nothing, controlling the company is all that matters. I think it might be more exciting if the company stock pool was reduced to 8 or even 7 in the 3 player game so the "steal from the director" shenanigans could start sooner. On a baseline level, I think a more interesting system would be to have each stock pay out the full company score (i.e.: incentive to buy more shares in good companies, incentive for the director to invest more even when there doesn't seem to be a threat), but I can understand why that wasn't done: it creates a huge headache because of how high the scores would be (at least 5-7X higher than they are usually) and it would potentially create even more runaway issues. It at least seems like it would work better than the existing system, which feels cobbled.

This game annoys me to some degree though. If the stock system worked a little better, then I would be able to love this game without reservation. Because of its limitations, I like the game, but rarely push to get it onto the table. The Germany board tried an entirely different scheme which to me was about the equal of this one; it works but it still doesn't make the game hum the way that it feels like it should.

This game was interesting and fairly fun. I like railroad games so that helped. The game also has some interesting mechanics including of course the dice. We've only played one game but it was a little dissappointing in that two players got out into a big lead. Me being one of them. This game will require more plays to fully see how fighting over the shares will all pan out.

I'm torn.  On the one hand, the game as published has problems.  It runs way too long, the stock mechanism is not the best, and it is easy to mess up the tile placement, in my experience.  But there are so many brilliant new mechanisms in the game, and it is so original, that I think it is definitely worth owning, playing, and tinkering with.  I also have high hopes for the first expansion.

RATING: 3
A few clever ideas packaged into a long, fiddly, and severely underdeveloped mess. The badly broken shareholder system, in which only first place matters at all and shares can be randomly stolen, is the most egregious offender. It also needs a complete overhaul of the unsatisfying ending conditions and a severe runaway leader problem.

The dice as currency mechanism is unique as heck and works exceedingly well, giving  some randomness, but not too much.  The components are wonderful, considering the relatively small print run.  I had to downgrade my rating as I'm not sure that this game works well...  The stocks aren't moveable enough and the 'rich get richer' problem is extensive, causing massive upheavals in directorship once players have nothing else to do...

RATING: 4
Low rating is based on the fact that there is a serious problem with the stock market. The concept of the game is interesting, but it just doesn't work, at least not with 4 players. There should be some incentive to be the second shareholder. I don't really understand the restriction on not being able to take over shares from another player until shares of 4 companies are sold out. I was very disappointed in this game, I wanted it to be better, but it just isn't.

A "rich gets richer" game with some funky player sequencing.
If you can get a few early stations down, your income improves, which allows you to put more stations down, which.... produces a run away leader.
I also found the passing of the start player marker in the same direction as playing order a bit irksome since one player pretty much has nothing to do for 2 turns (first on turn 1, last on turn 2). This can make the game drag.
Beyond these small complaints, a reasonably innovative game with dice playing a multitude of rolls (cash, track, shares, etc) and the "zoom in / zoom out" map works surprisingly well.
Definitely scope for some sneaky and vicious play - the track can be run on then off several boards between your own builds. And the whole "do something, get more dice, so can do something else, to get more dice, etc" is quite fun & fulfilling.

So clever it becomes dull is the right way to describe this game I guess. The share system is weird, the map system is clever and weird and so on.

RATING: 4
Players use dice as money/track to fund a railway line and build stations in one of five companies along the line.  Stations can only be built by the director (major share holder - shares in companies are bought too).  As more and more stations get on the board, income goes up (more dice to play with) which means the rich get richer and do more stuff (and get richer again).  Some "catch the leader" rules that force the change of directorship are included but seem hard to implement as the game will end about the same time directorship changes trigger.  Two hours plus with the unlucky forced to watch and not do a lot about it.  It is different and there is some clever stuff in there - perhaps just a tweak or three off being a great game.

I disliked RR Dice 2 so much, was surprised I like this one better, or even at all. The dice are much easier to place as track--just too crowded in RR Dice 2. 

Aspects of this game and RR Dice 2 have much in common but there are differences.  For example, in RR Dice 2, just as I found it unique that chips were interchangeable as currency & passengers, in this game dice the dice are both currency & track.  Unusual.  Like other RR games, shares are sold in this game, and the board placement is very different. 

I did not find the board confusing, as some have commented.  In fact I find the board (2 boards, actually) clever, and it certainly takes up less table space.  The screens are a bit too small and toppley.  

Still it is a dice game that is hugely luck based, the rules are ambiguous, and it becomes too repetitious.  After about the 4th station I placed, I was wondering when the game would end--it dragged on a long time after that.  I think I will enjoy the game more if we reduce the number of stations required to trigger end game by about half.  There is a serious catch-the-leader problem, too.

Great, innovative concept, but the game is lacking.

The manual is a disaster. After you finally go through it, the gameplay is at the beginning rather unclear. You're not sure what to do and even if you do there's not so much you really can. On top of it - the graphics is horrible.

Luckily it's not so random game as the title would suggest. After a while you have a real influence on what happens on the board and you can implement some strategies. But it's too little to make a really good game out of it. It's enough only for a decent one.

New players need to be warned to focus more on the stockmarket than building track, but there is a balance to find  Still, I have found this to be quite accessible and enjoyable for intermediate gamers.  It is a game of making the most out of opportunities and adjusting when opportunities are missed (due to others play or less helpful rolls).  The dice give a reasonable amount of luck, but there are many opportunities to obtain "wild" dice to do what you like.

At the beginning of this game I had no idea what the heck was going on.  It definitely is unique in the use of dice as both currency and track.  I like the mini-map / big-map idea.  I can't help but think that was influenced by the 'radar' view in computer games.  It works!  The stock holding and domination of companies can really kill you and it seems like it is very aggressive in that regard.  The game did drag on a bit for me, and it wasn't too exciting, but I would happy to give it another go.  I am also curious to try Railroad Dice 2, which might be more to my liking.

This is a very nifty game.  You basically are playing to two boards, which result in a map of smaller tiles, on these you are trying to get connected chains of your railroad's colour in order to score victory points each turn (which are called passengers).  Also has an interesting "hose-the-leader" mechanic in which (after a certain stage of the game) you can buy shares off the director of the company (thus reducing their shares, and allowing the  stealing of directorships, and thus cutting down a player who has worked hard to build a brilliant line).  If you get a good lead you can attempt to break the bank by saving up your dice so other players can't steal your good paying railroad and catch you.

Initially this seems like an original take on the train game, but it soon becomes apparent that this is a strictly luck-driven affair. Only the majority share holder can score in each company and you may not get enough of the 'right' dice to buy shares and extend their value by building a station. Had this been a 45 minute game it would have worked, at twice that (sometimes more) it just becomes monotonous. As is so often true, less is more.

A nice idea, but not perfectly executed, even with the SOS variant scoring rules. The shares just don't seem to sell out, which means the squabbling over companies doesn't happen. Perhaps you should get a VP for each share bought from the bank, or something, so there is some incentive to spend ?s on shares. I have high hopes for the other Railroad Dice games, but even this one isn't bad.

This is my initial rating after playing it with 4 and 2 players.  Had it been shorter and cost significantly less, I might have rated it as high as 7.

Play - or lack there of - over the next few weeks will decide.  And it has to compete with Power Grid and Age of Steam for table time, both of which are well worth the cost of admission and time to play.

Much more than a simple dice game with a railroad theme.  There's lots to think about, and it's a rather unique system.  There's still a bit of luck, however, but it did not seem overwhelming.  Played well with two, but I expect three or four to be better.

I enjoyed both the use of dice and the two board mechanism. The stealing of directorships can get nasty, but does give an opportunity for those lagging behind to impact the game. The game is at risk of devolving into tit-for-tat company stealing while the building of rails and stations become secondary. I need to play the game more to see if this is an attractive strategic element (the careful timing of takeovers for the winning play) or a finish where stealing back and forth is the unsatisfying end to what is essentially a building game. Certainly unique.

The concept is good but there is a balance problem. Personally, I would substitute curves (2 faces) for shares (1 face). The reason why is because you always get stuck with curves that you cannot do anything with them. Having less curves will force people to pass over some obstacles. Second, having more share would allow the companies to change their ownership. Right now all the players got either 1 or 2 company and it stayed like this until the end of the game. So it's like useless to try getting shares to steel somebody else company.

I like the ideas and how most of the game works.  I think it's a decent game but I'm not all too impressed except for the neat ideas you can do with the dice.  It essentially is a dice game disguised with some basic railroad game ideas.  I'm not sure I like the directorship/stock shares system per the original rules.  For my tastes, if the game took a shorter playing time, it would be more suitable.

A "train" game that as usual masquerades as such and is really about investing and building up companies with the unique twist that your actions are governed totally by dice!  The D6 has two sides which have a straight track, two sides with a corner track, 1 face with a buy 1 stock option, and 1 face with a "?" which serves as a wild OR can be turned in for two dice (which then have to be rolled if not used as currency).  This is a very aggressive game (or at least the one I played certainly was) where the player with the start marker routinely was raided for their companies and lost directorship of the company and the ability to earn passenger revenue/victory points.

RATING: 7
Very cool "thinking man's" dice game.  The stock mechanism seems to detract from the route building game as it seems a bit easy in the end game to wind up swapping properties based on timing and turn order and those responsible for building a company seem to get little reward for their efforts.  This can also be a little analysis paralysis inducing for me.

Really good, interesting design, but could have used some more development work. Some really neat an interesting concepts, and each decision feels important. However the game suffers badly from a "good gets better" syndrome. Would like to play with 3 players, or with a simple variant where each player gets to purchase one share for free on his turn. Downtime seems like it could be an issue.

This game went straight on my wish list after a single play (thanks, Mike!)  I think the appeal for me is that it's unusual in many respects:  The dice based mechanic (which is much less random than you would think, ) the micro/macro map board layout (haven't seen that in any other game) and the way that attention switches from track building to share ownership/directorship as more track is built makes for an absorbing play.

Played with twice so far (with 3 and 4) Very unique game but stock system is not quite working. Second stock holder has absolutely no benefit at all so no one try to buy them unless he/she wants to take over the directorship or exhaust the stocks in the bank so that he/she can buy the stocks of the best company. Also a lot of downtime. It was longer than we wanted it to be. Maybe I am looking for shorter and more dynamic game.

RATING: 5
The jury is still out after one play. I don't find this nearly as innovative as others do, and my initial reaction was pretty lukewarm. I do want to try it again with a better understanding of the rules (I screwed up multiple times, such as forgetting to keep a die in reserve to pay for my mountain build, and other things of that nature), but I doubt I will ever become a big fan of this one. Of course, as it's a dice game, I had horrible luck, too, rolling 10 dice at one time and getting 9 track sections and one question mark! I do, however, don't feel the game needs any rule tweaks as far as the stock and payoffs are concerned. I do think the game ends way too quickly, though, for the amount of thought required to get through the beginning rounds. *** UPDATE 6/5/04 *** A second playing with 2 players made one thing apparent... this game is bone dry. I felt just like I did back when I took computer programming classes in college (I dropped these courses quickly, by the way!) - bored out of my mind. I find there is almost no room for creativity in this game - something I find very unappealing in games. In fact, many well-designed games (as I feel this one is) don't have a chance with me because of this lack of creative options (Hansa comes to mind as another game like this - well done but just not for me).

The stock mechanic is broken in that players can be totally locked out after spending so much time collecting shares.  Despite this major problem, I'll give this game a 3 because it's based on a good concept.  Unfortunately, the concept breaks down during actual gameplay.

There's a reasonable game in there but the stock certificate acquisition seems a bit odd. Also, limiting one station per company per tile seems to drag the game out - we decided to allow multiple stations per tile (with intervening track).

RATING: 7
One play with four players.

Highly innovative game marred by rules that seem necessary to make the game playable but are counterintuitive from a logical point-of-view, make the game anti-climactic, or contribute to the runaway leader problem.

* A corporation scores by the number of stations that are built on adjacent tiles, despite the fact that no track has been built between those tiles. This is forgivable because of the game's innovative "big map/mini map" design. The "mini map" keeps track of stations built, not tracks.

* Only the majority shareholder gains income from its respective corporation. In your "typical" stock market game, each shareholder receives some dividend. This would be forgivable by the illogical rule that players may forcefully buy other players' stock. However, you have to be lucky enough to roll either a stock symbol or a question mark to buy stock. And it takes time to amass a lot of dice, and almost impossible to amass dice *and* build track *and* build stations to score points. In the meantime, the leaders are doing all this easily.

* One of the game-ending conditions occurs when the bank runs out of dice. In a four player game, there is not enough dice. In our last game, the player in the lead simply hoarded dice on his last turn. (We were playing with open scoring, though.)

Unlike most (maybe all) train games, this has an exploration quality because the map is revealed tile-by-tile.

I'm beginning to feel deeply anxious when railroad games are put in front of me. This one was as bad as a six-player Union Pacific. Sit around and watch others planning and rolling dice and building stations for fifteen-twenty minutes before you get a look in. The only excitement is stealing shares but this happens one or two turns from the end of the game. Difficult to take control of shares otherwise. Very fiddly too with lots of little rulings from building track through hills to number of dice as income for four different situations. Friends who like railroad games liked this one. I don't and didn't.

RATING: 6.1
Clever mechanics, but appears to lack some refinements. It is easy to get behind and hard to catch up. The stock market seems tacked on and difficult to manipulate. There is no motivation for owning stock in other companies, other than trying to take over ownership or simply draining the market so you can purchase other player's stock. Small payouts would have been nice, and help balance out the runaway leader issue this game seems to have. 

Manipulating and juggling your dice in front and behind the screen- as both currency and track- was fun and interesting. Making connections and building up your route was enjoyable, though having tiles get locked out makes a 4 player game chaotic. So much can change between turns, you can easily find your connections destroyed before you can respond. Downtime between turns is an issue, especially if you are the start player: everyone else will get two turns before you go again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice development game, but does have a runaway leader issue if the others players aren't careful.  

I still like the game for its unique use of dice and the overall bit factor.  I like how the large tiles and small tiles are related.  This might not be played often, but when it is played, I enjoy the experience.

RATING: 7
Some brilliant ideas undone by underdevelopment.  Once one player develops a strong company, the ability to take that company away comes too late.

I would try again with either the rules for RRD-Germany or some moifications to the original.  (Possibly fewer shares in certain companies.)

You have to do the 'SOS' variants and there is some tweaking required with the end of the game + stock rules.  We found the shares of stock moved too easily between players, basically have directorships of all the major companies change hands ever turn once the sudden-death rules kicked in.

Have only played this game solitaire (yes, I know, I'm nuts), so I can not really comment.
Seems to have some small "runaway" leader problems, but I'd have to play against different human opponents and not my imaginary friends to be sure of this.
But I have to say: the dice are so cool, I really don't care :D

RATING: 4
Unforgiving and rather long, yet it feels somewhat different from other railroad games. There's an interesting mechanism in there with the doubling of question mark dice when using them to roll, and the in front of and behind the screen dice. My only concern is the constant swappng of directorships in the second half of the game - it places a lot of worth on a player trying to end the game when they're the start player, just as the directorships start to get handed back to the other players. Worth exploring further, maybe.

Railroad Dice (2nd Edition) -- Played once; four-player.  Deep game.  We made several mistakes in our first play, but I think most were the fault of unfamiliarity -- even the more specific rules actually seem relatively intuitive to me.  Familiarity should prevent such mistakes in the future.  I can only hope familiarity will also speed the game up.  One cannot buy shares from other players until the bank has sold all shares for a number of companies.  Reducing this number might speed the game.  I respect the game, and I think I could come to like it more.

Takes a while to get used to, and it doesn't help that there's a typo in the English rules.  Once you get hold of a company directorship, it seems too strong, which means if the number of companies doesn't split directly between the number of players it can feel rather unfair.  I do love the idea of using the dice though, and feel there should be a way to fix the unevenness, even if I can't figure out how.

Interesting design.  I like dice games and it introduces a unique system for using a unique set of dice.  On the downside, the rules are confusing.  In fact, if you look at the comments, there are a ton from experienced gamers who were playing incorrectly, missing rules, etc.  Also, there is too much downtime.  
In some games, downtime is okay if you need the time to think and/or it's interesting enough to see what others are doing on their turns.  Some of that exists here, but not enough to compensate for the wait.  I'm interested to see if my rating would change upon repeat playings, but I'm not in a rush to play again.

I am railroad game lover in heart. I love dice and dice games. It makes me like this game, and to try it out. Bought it for long without trying it, because I kept waiting for appropriate players who would enjoy strategic games with dice rolling. 1 years later, I got a chance to play test it. Rules are not difficult but suffer from translation issues. Thankful that there is an awesome online tutorial teaching you the rules.
The game itself is interesting, and attractive from its ideas. The rules for being a director is however somewhat broken in my mind. I would develop a house rule to fix it. Or, I would like to play with the Crossing extension rules.

Each player is an investor who wants to take control of one or more of the 5 Railroad companies with the aim of constructing as many adjacent Railway Stations as possible in order to attract the most Passengers.

The game is played simultaneously on two large tiles upon which the tracks and stations are built. In a fairly unique methodology, finished tiles are replaced by miniature tiles as the tracks grow.

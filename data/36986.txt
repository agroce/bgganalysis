This game should be awesome sauce.  Let's see: Zombies?  Check.  Mayhem?  Check.  Good looking game?  Check.  Knizia's name isn't on it?  Check.

So what in the heck happened?

Well, it's stupid, that's what.  It's not stupid in the "I'm going to insult the player with a theme so lame that they will feel they are the butt of a joke" way that Eurogames manage stupid.  No, this is a whole different type of stupid.

You ever seen 50 clowns get out a Volkswagen Beetle?  Those clowns have nothing on these zombies.  75 of them can fit into a small room.  The stacking limit is infinity.  You seriously worry about the stack falling over!

And know this: when the zombie apocalypse comes, courage, cunning, intelligence, and tenacity are not traits that will help you.  No, what you want is a "bad reputation" (Joan Jett will thrive in the world of zombies).  If you have a bad reputation, then when the zombies try to surround you, you will run away and live to fight another day (or turn).  If you don't have a bad reputation, you will stand still while they eat your brains.

Like I said, a unique brand of stupid.

We sent a crew to zombie ville with the goal of exploring so many buildings.  We had the 2 bad reputation people run around an open field while 50 zombies chased them.  We got all of our crew wasted except 1 person and we won the game.  So what did we accomplish?  Absolutely nothing.  It wasn't a tactical strike against the zombies.  It felt more like a drunken dare: hey, I bet you guys can't run into that zombie-infested village and open up 5 doors!

Why is it so hard to make a good zombie game?  Is it the lack of dinosaurs?  At least we have Dawn of the Zeds so we know it's not impossible.

Though a zombie game, the scenarios makes or breaks the game. The amount of luck you need to flip those zombie cards are just as critical for the loot.

The best possible way to play is run in circles, killing off zombies with minimal shooting. Enter a building at a time and do the run-round-kill routine till most zombies are killed before searching for loot. 

More interesting way to play is to remove some empty loot cards are reduce the complexity by removing some high numbered zombie cards.

Overall, the system uses high numbers for shooting and low numbers for melee. Survivor reactions are somewhat semi controlled by the dice and chart. Which can create some strange outcomes...standing still and fight numerous charging zombie, or running away when only 1 zombie comes after you.....ironic and illogical.

Somehow, I felt the system was brought over from a squad level wargame into this story. Allowing the system to run a mindless zombie enemy, that is not fully tested. So partial system works....the survivors.....but some parts, fails....which in this case the zombie system.

Anyway, the zombies appears 'out of the open', which does not make sense. And they run just as fast as the survivors....so it looks like World War Z, the movie.

Overall, a weak experience and resolution for a zombie game.

Very Fun! Entertaining and engaging!Graphics are cool and elegant. The system is very easy to learn and plays quick. It does simulate a zombie apocalypse! The way you spent your equipment points and distribute weapons among survivors will make the difference. Protect the "stars" and make the best out of the grunts, keeping them on the tail of stars characters. THere are few consistent strategies to use to avoid being surrounded. Luck plays however a big factor but still... it is a horror survival game ! :)

A big disappointment.  The components had some serious defects:  the paper on one mapboard is peeling away from the centerline, the other mapboard shows some flaking.  Zombie loot cards have different colored backs.  To their credit, LnL has sent me replacement boards.

The game itself is ok, but cooperative play against the zombies is fairly tedious.  I've experimented with some variant competitive games with survivors on opposing sides, and they show promise.

Based on the game as I received it, I can't recommend it.

Even with the new components, I just don't have any desire to play this game...

As chits go, the quality of these are second to none.  That being said, the price of this game for what you get (even considering the quality) is excessive, in my opinion.  Still, it has good artwork/style and I am glad I own it.  

We don't play it much, usually opting to play Better Dead than Zed because we'd rather use minis than tokens/chits.

Solid premise and rules and I respect the design.  It just doesn't get much play.  It is great for road trips when space is an issue, though.

A light game with easy rules. At least when you start to know the different situations where you should do what.
As you throw dice to decide who goes first, there can be quite strange and funny situations.

The rules  used to create more zombies are good. As soon as you start to make noice you will attract more zombies which isn't good.
The scenarios included have a rising difficulty, which will make the game longevity great.

Haven't played it yet, but it sure looks pretty, in a zombie is going to eat your brains sort of way.

Edit: I've played a few of the scenarios at this point and am getting kinda blah about the game. The rules aren't as tight as they could be and so a player kinda just has to play so that they are in the spirit of the rules. Not a game for rule lawyers. Now that I think about it more it more of a sandbox from which you can build your own fun. That is okay with me at times. It tells a good story, but it's not a game which you think about your strategy much once the game night is over.

RATING: 5
I am not a wargamer. In fact, I have never even played a real wargame. As a result, I had to read this rulebook three times before I had any idea what was going on, and I still don't think I understood the game. The rules for movement and ranged/melee combat, though a little counter-intuitive at first (roll + add reputation for ranged attacks, roll and compare successes for melee), make sense after a couple of turns. Determining initiative was a little trickier, but I got the hang of it. 

Where I really lost patience, however, was in the rules for charging/charge reactions, panic fire, received fire, and in-sight reactions. What started as a relatively straightforward skirmish system suddenly became bogged down with all sorts of unnecessary and tedious things to remember. I still enjoyed myself, but I'd like to play this with someone more experienced so that THEY can keep track of all of this crap while I just have fun!

RATING: 3
Overall I am pretty disappointed with the game. I have played the mini game only once, but it seems far superior to the board game version. I would like it a lot more if it was a bit deeper with campaign rules (which Ed says he is going to post), more actions, vehicles, etc... Until then it is just a watered down specter of the minis game.

Also, I fucking HATE the stupid stacking limit of one character in a hex, but an unlimited amount of zombies. A home take's up one hex & yet only one survivor can be in it, so the scale is just screwy. That is just ridiculous. There has to be sensible way to correct this.

The game is the bastard child of a wargame and an ameritrash zombie game. Not that there is anything wrong with the concept in my book.

[Update 09/18/2010]

Still no sign of any real info on deepening the campaign, adding vehicles, etc... other than being told to port over rules from the mini game. What is the freaking point of this board game? Am I wrong or was the purpose of this was to be able to play the mini game without all the fuss of miniatures and terrain. So, it remains on the shelf collecting dust. I have half a mind to trade it to someone else that would actually give a shit to play it.

Also, it is interesting that the designer is listed as just Mark Walker. I would have it would have been shared by both him and Ed. To me it seems that Ed handed the game to Lock n' Load and they just remade the game their way. So, it seems that the mini game is the only real option until someone comes up a zombie campaign board game that makes sense. 

and I still hate the fucking idiotic stacking limits!

I have yet to try this game with more than 1 player, but it does work really well as a solo game.

AS far as Zombie-themed games go, I prefer LNoE.  It has a slightly more "tongue in cheek" feel to it.  ATZ feels slightly darker - maybe because with the hexes and all, it feels like more of a wargame, which I'm not fond of.  It's a tough game to win, because everything you do spawns more zombies.  The hardest part was the dice rolls.  Some you needed to roll high, some low, and it was difficult to keep straight which was which.  But bottom line, ATZ was just missing the elusive "fun factor" that is present with LNoE.  

Rating dropped because I've decided that I'm pretty much done with the whole zombie thing.

RATING: 8
Nice modular maps printed on hard board, large counters, item cards and a colorful rulebook completes the game box. The game mechanics shares similarities with a wargame but your foe is comprised by waves of zombies. You can select a stand alone scenario or a campaign game finding other survivors on your way and making a run to a helipad. You equip your characters with armory and try to survive. The sound of gunfire brings more zombies; the searching of buildings brings handy items for your struggle. Although the rules are questionable in some paragraphs, the game play runs well and has tense moments. A nice addition to a wargame collector.

Prior to Zombicide this was, I felt, the best zombie game on the market. It provided that swarming nature, setting up bottlenecks, exploring and gathering. It worked really well I felt in spite of the clunky rulebook. The game works better solo though because the light campaign combined with variable hero numbers made it a very clunky multi-player experience. In a post-Zombicide world though, this game is out of date.

I hit the wall with spending time reading the rules forum and trying to figure this game out after 8 plays. I eventually gave up on the game as in addition to rules confusion, it lacked some pizzazz. 

That the designer removed his name from the game's page over disagreement with the publisher's final version indicates this isn't the game that was meant to be, and sure enough, years later a new version of this is being released by the new management of Lock 'n Load. 

I would avoid this version and seek out the new one.

experience the zombie apocalypse ... alone or with friends. just be careful about firing that gun cuz the zeds can always "hear you now". It's like they are all Verizon subscribers and your pistol's the cell phone. Yeah, OK, I took that way too far.

This is apparently a war game implementation of the miniatures game of the same game. This game can be played solo (you against the zeds), co-op (you and some friends against the zeds), or competitively (you against your friends who are also survivors ... and you all have to worry about the zeds).

You may need a zombie motel. Zeds check in, but they don't check out. Rats. There I go again.

I am actually quite disappointed.
Ambiguous rules and impossible odds make for dull and repetitive game play. 
Shooting to kill a zombie on a 50-50 die result, results in even more zombies turning up, so the zombie horde escalates faster than you can physically cut them down. So do you opt to run away? 
The Zombies generally move as fast if not faster than you so there is no getting away from the horde of zombies. And Melee? 
Don't bother rolling your up to 2 dice against the 1die each (possible infinity) horde, just go sit in the corner... and die quietly.

Great little game, great introductory game for would-be wargamers, takes only 5 minutes to teach.  The cooperative element of the scenarios makes it not so confrontational for first timers.  

I break this out every time now if I want to introduce someone to hex & counter wargames.

From a more hardcore wargamer point-of-view, this is a very light & basic game.  The scenarios are not very imaginative and reminds me of those in the computer game "Left 4 Dead", but they are a bit of quick zombie killing fun just like the said computer game.  

Didn't like all the scenarios, the 2nd scenario was just plain boring, the zombies just keep spawning on one end of the map and you simply have to run to the other side of the map and hold at an advantageous spot till the game turns run out... a lot of pointless book keeping (spawning the monsters) but not enough action.  But fortunately there are other good scenarios where you are protecting someone and searching buildings for loot that make up for it.

I really have mixed feelings about this game.  I REALLY wanted to LOVE it.  I don't.  However, I don't hate it, either.  In a way this reminds me very much of the older minigames from the 70s to 80s.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as I'm a fan of such fare.  However, they typically (as does this game) lack depth.  For the retail price and even at online discount, it just doesn't feel like it meets it's price point.  I know it's not a mass market game, but overall considering the production, I'd have expected more like a $30 retail price.  The boards themselves are mounted (no annoying paper maps!), and I rather DO like them overall, but the gloss sheen detracts from the gritty world I'm trying to imagine during play.  

I've only played the first 3 scenarios solo as a campaign.  The possiblity of solo play is entirely why I bought this.  2nd Scenario was almost impossible due to above average zombie spawn rolls, even with new equipment and personnel purchased from the previous scenario.  First was difficult because couldn't find any decent weapons, had to clear all buildings to satisfy win requirements.  By the time 3rd scenario came up, I was so loaded down with purchased survirors and weapons, it wasn't even a challenge.  I'm not sure I'll even finish the campaign, maybe just play the scenarios through as printed.  

Little thought seems to have been put into the actual campaign, and there are only 6 scenarios.  Sure it would be easy to come up with your own, I suppose. However, sometimes I just want to open a game up and go.  I barely have time to play games, much less spend time padding their content.  :)

What I do like is that the game moves relatively quickly, if you're good at the bookkeeping end of games.  I.E. knowing the turn sequences, when and how to move zombie A.I, placements, etc.   Pretty much every turn is the same.  Roll initiative, move/Fire, melee, search, spawn zombies at turn end.  There aren't a ton of exceptions, so I'm not always having to flip through the manual looking for what to do every single action.   

The zeds have 3 different speeds, that differentiate them and other than artwork, nothing else does.  They are really only dangerous in groups, which is quite movie thematic, if you think about it.  It becomes quite evident which characters/weapons/and equipment to choose each scenario, leaving little reason to ever choose/use the others, unless found in a search.   

I'm really torn on this game.  I'm half tempted to trade this away while hot, as I don't think it will have legs after the inital play through of the campaign.  It does have a skirmish mode where players can face off amidst the zed threat.  That might be a bit more fun, but I'm not entirely convinced.  

Hope your mileage runs further.  Perhaps my expectations for this boardgame were too high and unreasonable.

Seems like a step down from the minis game--less variety, less sense of narrative. Stripped of its embellishments, the core system isn't as compelling--you make a whole bunch of rolls, and maybe you eke out a win or the zombies eat you. A little too much busywork in terms of moving all the zombies and managing all the other chits.

The rule book is incomplete and poorly written. The "Ed Sez" tips are useless it would have been more useful to have a separate section in the rules for game play tips.

Lock 'n Load doesn't seem very interested in answering questions in the forum.

A clever little zombie game with wargame mechanics. Great looking and mounted (!) maps, large counters. As wargames go, this one is fast and simple while at the same time offering different choices and tactics. Cooperative: Players versus Zombies, which are governed by a set of clever and very thematic rules. Could have benefitted from more scenarios, weapons and characters. I'm looking forward to possible future expansions.

Juego de Oz. Interesante aunque con carencias (activaci√≥n de personajes, personajes de participaci√≥n variable seg√∫n caracter√≠sticas demasiado diferentes, poca variedad de escenarios). Se presta mucho a introducir, cambiar y modificar reglas. Se teme a los zombies... ergo es un buen juego de zombies.

The wargamer's zombie game. Rules leave a lot unanswered, but the enormous FAQ helps a lot. Slightly simplistic and quite random system which cries out for more variety; boards, characters, equipment, scenarios, special zombie adversaries.

Played three scenarios as a 2-player coop, and we both had great fun. Recommended.

Update: Lowered my rating a bit. The system is great, but the scenario selection is unsatisfactory: Too few and of varying quality.

Update: Played a competitive survivor-vs-survivor scenario. It didn't work as well as the coop ones, and the rules were woefully inadequate. The result was also quite random. That being said, it was good fun. :)

The Good: Fairly good theme. The components are fairly good. 

The Bad: I just did not have much fun. You have to constantly consult tables. The dice rolls are not intuitive - in some cases you are trying to roll less than your Rep, in some cases you are adding to your Rep, in some cases you are adding the number of Zombies to their rep, etc. Lots of luck - loads of dice rolling and card drawing. I felt that the Luck factor swamped out any strategy in the game.

Une Ugly: This game took way too much study for the light diversion it proved to be. The manual left out key rules and concepts. I eventually found the answers here in the rules forum, But I still had to wade thru a ton of stuff to find answers in the rules forum in addition to the rather long manual. Overall the rules were a frustrating experience.

This is quite possibly the most pointless game that I have ever played. I found it to be no fun at all. The strategy is move around to avoid the zombies because there is no point in trying to kill them. Every time you fire a noise-producing weapon, you generate more zombies than you kill. This is a poorly implemented hex and counter wargame with a pasted on zombie theme. I use the term theme loosely as the game has no real zombie flavor. It's a dull, very vanilla game with few meaningful choices to be made. I particularly despise the rolling to activate mechanic. That just doesn't work for this kind of game.

  I like some of the ideas presented here.  It's just not that post apocalyptic ass kicking game I wanted it to be.  It's more of a run around sneaking and avoiding combat you don't initiate chess match against the Zombies.  I played it as the Zombies once and a friend played the survivors and it was horrible.  A second solo game was (after some rules clarifications) was much better.  Let the Zombies play themselves and have the players each play a survivor.  Anything else will just tend to frustrate you both.

Despite wanting to like this, something about it fell a bit flat for me. After the first two plays, I have looked for excuses to keep it on the shelf more than excuses to take it off the shelf.

I think this is a good game, but the jury is still out.  Components are okay, but could have been so much better (e.g., the cards could have been used for several things, and not just the fairly boring loot search).  Based on a couple of plays, I like the game, and time will tell if it has staying power.  I do wish, though, that LnL would improve their rulebooks -- they're too loose and vague for me.

Awful game. Rolling to see if your hero does anything is a novel concept...It just doesn't work. Your hero can literally sit there for 2-3 turns doing nothing and then just die. With a bit of bad luck it is possible that one player will get to make 0 decision the whole game and die early. That is the epitome of bad game design in my books. The weapons are grossly unbalanced. The shotgun is almost useless in its present form as it makes more zombies than it could possibly kill. Meleeing zombies (baseball bat and armor) or small arms fire (crossbow) is often an effective way to deal with them as you can eliminate them without bringing many more onto the map. The character cards felt like they were printed on cheap cardstock. The map is also quite bland. The rest of the components are passable but not great. One of the worst games I have ever played.

I picked this one up at a local game shop on a whim. The cover art looked a little cartoony so we almost passed on it but the description on the back of the box convinced us to give it a try. Well, I'm glad we tried it because it is easily our favorite Zombie game.

The game offers tons of options. The simple rules are very easy to alter to make the game easier or harder. The solo play is every bit as fun as the multi player play. You can play co-op with other players against the zombies (this is the way we like to play it) or go head to head pitting survivors against survivors (with zombies in the mix of course). You also get a number of very nice mounted maps that can put together to create lots of different landscapes. The reason this game beats the rest of the zombie games out there is sheer variety. Games are always different and its fun to create your own situations and encounters. Most of our zombie themed games gather dust now.

The components are top notch. Very colorful maps and counters. The counters are bigger than many game counters. Nice hand drawn art that fits the game well. The rule book is well written and easy to follow with lots of nicely illustrated examples of play. The game includes a bunch of different scenarios but my son and I were instantly creating our own setups and winning conditions. This game is like a toolkit for creative gamers.

We are fans of The Walking Dead TV show and this game can easily nail the sorts of situations presented in the show. I highly recommend this game to anyone remotely interested in zombie games. Even if you aren't typically a fan of the zombie genre this is just a really well designed easy to play game. The rules are simple enough to allow you to play with the whole family and open enough to allow you to alter to hit your difficulty sweet spot.

EDIT: I ordered the second "Reloded" edition. This game was fantastic but believe it or not Reloaded takes every element of this game to the next level. It now has rules for turning this board game into a role playing game. LnL made lots of tweaks to the mechanics and the game plays even smoother now.

Second session. We played the second scenario. Ended up losing one character in the run for the building.  Never had a chance to search for additional items due to the fact we had to stay together for mutual support because of the huge number of zombies we were being pursued by.  The lost character ended up getting swarmed by 16 zombies.  Because no more than one character can be in a hex, there was little to be done when melee occurred. I will have to catch up on the comments and updates to see if we did anything wrong, but we do not believe so. The three survivors ended up being within one turn of a total overrun by the zombies.  We adjusted the scenario to have a 3mp perimeter all the way around the building, if we had not, the game would have ended by turn 12.

Based on first night's playing. The initial try at the first scenario was a disaster as we set up way too many zombies using the rules in section 11, which seem to be missing specific info on how zombies are created at the start of a scenario.  By reading the example of play, we were able to determine that a roll of "greater than four" was needed to produce zombie counters, while in game a roll of 4, 5, or 6 does so.  We were surprised at the lack of clarity in the rules on this point.  The second game went pretty smoothly as was completed in less than twenty minutes.  Rating will probably adjust with more play next week.

RATING: 6
The game is...interesting. I enjoyed my first play, but I'm not sure about the reaction tests. It seems like you're often hoping for a "bad" result (i.e., panic) so that zombies will be drawn off in some random direction, chasing the sacrificial lamb.

The initiative roll-off is both brilliant and weird: It creates a lot of tension and variety, but it also produces some odd results. It reminds me of Combat Commander the way that chaos reigns supreme even when it flies in the face of common sense. People should [i]occasionally [/i]behave erratically, but not almost all the time. The grunts are a little [i]too [/i]prone to failing activation rolls and fleeing randomly into groups of zombies. 

It would benefit, I think, from some sneaking around. Like, you could sometimes sneak past zombies.

The stacking limits are off. One survivor per hex versus unlimited zombies per hex. Surely you could house rule it to two survivors/10 zombies, or thereabouts. Yes, the zombies have no concept of "personal space" and like to swarm, but unlimited stacking is nonsensical.

I'm pretty sure my search for that perfect zombie game has not ended. For now, this one rates a 6. That's not a bad rating, really, but that's also including a bonus point for it being about zombies. I still plan to play this game at least a few more times--maybe more--and so it could move up or down in my ratings. It's definitely got some good ideas and is worth exploring.

The game plays very well by ones self and I look forward to doing adversarial and co-op play as well as develop some house rules where necessary.

The game runs incredibly smooth and has a perfect amount of difficulty it seems.  Some of the narrow points of death comes down to luck, but hey, that's life with zombies.

I will update when I play different modes!

Wargame-like zombie game, what is not to like. One of the best parts of this game in my opinion is the unknown. At times your characters may take off running in a random directly or decide to stand and fight when you don't want them too. Some player may not like this aspect of the game, but I think it adds some realism, as most people may be a little out of the head when attacked by zombies. :)

Based on my first playing, I'll give it a 6. A bad roll on turn 1 of the first scenario has given me 7 zombies to fight right off the bat, so I'm getting some action pretty quickly. The game is fairly easy to play, though I wish the rules writer had dispensed with the extraneous comments and jokes. The rules could have been much shorter and clearer, and removing the jokes would have made room for more examples of play.

I enjoy this game. The theme really appeals to me, and the components are very nice. A few points cause me to give this game a lower rating than I had wished to.
:d6-1: the rules are ambiguous on many points and have caused me to interpret what I think the correct move would be in a few too many situations. The rules should have been longer and more specific. It's not that they need to be more complex, they just need to be fleshed out and clear. I anticipate this will cause the most problems and create the most frustration for new players. After playing a half dozen times and scouring the rules forums here on BGG, the game play is actually fairly simple and sensible. It just takes an investment in time & rules scouting to get there.
:d6-2: I wished LnL had developed the campaign more. A few more scenarios and a template for players to build their own campaign would have been nice. I would like a randomizing tool so the player(s) don't know exactly what type of mission/encounter they'll have the next scenario.
:d6-3: I also wish there were more survivor characters, additional items, and some type of random event generator for during and inbetween scenarios. I think a random event generator similar to Nuklear Winter 68 (minus the chit draw system) would be cool. :d6-2: and :d6-3: effect my rating and appreciation of this game the most.

The individual scenarios that I've played have all proven fun. Sometimes they go easier, sometimes harder. But that's all part of the activation system, which works really well and will give the game more replayability.

I also really appreciate that this game was designed with solitaire play in mind. It is well done in that aspect and is very fun as a solitaire experience.

I'm also looking forward to fan based expansion material, and will probably try to design a campaign of my own in addition to the other improvements I'd hoped for. I will recommend this game to someone who's into tactical situations and a zombie theme.

Already own and love the ATZ minis game; got the boardgame (finally) for when I don't want to set up the wargames table and mess with terrain.
Searching buildings is too hard, IMO. Only one survivor per building versus up to 6 zeds is tough.
Rules leave a bit to be desired, but with a lot of ATZ minis experience no problem for me.
Upped my rating half a point after trying the skirmish rules and being able to kit out my survivors to my liking. Made for a better game I think.

I really like the full game by 2 Hour Wargames, so I was curious to check out the boardgame vesion as well.  The boardgame version loses a lot of what I liked about the game though and what's leftover isn't very exciting.  Mostly what you seem to do here is try and search buildings.  When you search in the full game, you might find some food needed to keep your characters alive between games, you might find weapons or ammo, you might find several different types of survivors kitted out with their own gear who will react to you differently based on who you are and what you're carrying, you might find a car that lets you move from the city to the countryside, or different things which make the game feel much more open with possibilities like an RPG.  When you search buildings in the boardgame version of All Things Zombie, you might find a generic "survivor", or you might find some item, which all feel about the same except for the numbers of dice they let you roll for something.  The flavor and excitement somehow have been lost.

This is really enjoyable solo. A nice, relatively simple system able to deliver real tension and I love the idea of the campaign. 
The scenarios are great in that they give you various tasks to achieve which really drives the gameplay and keeps you interested - marvelous.
The only thing missing here are event cards with some thematic flavour text and more effects than just the number of Zombies you've come across.

Strange mix of components; beautiful, mounted maps but square cornered cards, glossy and attractive counters but thin character mats with scuffed edges.

More of a simulation than a real immersive "Zombie Game" experience, I have found this one to shine as a solo game. The base campaign included with the game is a blast to play through, and I look forward and hope to see new ones in expansions and on the web site.

If I had to choose a multi=player zombie game, I would still play Last Night on Earth however.

Il gioco in se sembra buono ma sembra premiere di pi√π gli scontri corpo a corpo, perche com si comincia a far fuoco la situazione degenera esponenzialmente rendendo la vittoria quasi impossibile. da riprovare prima di un giudizio pi√π sensato.

An okay tactical level zombie game modeled after LnL's tactical combat system found in their Band of Heroes war games.  Good for when you want a more structured approach along with a bit more control than found in something like LNoE.  Nice counters and boards with good potential for future scenarios and expansions.

Post-apocalyptic miniatures zombie game.  RPG‚Äôish & wargame‚Äôish with extensive rules and dice and table resolved actions.  I like the unique addition of wandering NPC human classes. Competitive and co-op modes with player elimination.

Its wargame-like flavor makes this one a nice fit with my collection. It's a challenge to survive, and a heck-of-alot of fun trying.

The cooperative angle of All Things Zombie is a minor step up from Zombies!, but otherwise it's just as disappointing as its rival. The game is a chafing bore, where - if you're lucky - you'll be prevented from moving for multiple turns.  Why? Because this will free up your time to scout around and find something better to play.

Now that I think about it, the style and mechanics of ATZ remind me of the homebrew cut-and-play games that were printed in gaming magazines in the 80s.  Trust me - this is not a flattering comparison.

I can't help but wonder whether zombie board games are - at their core - pointless exercises, and that video games (e.g., House of the Dead, Blood) are the only medium that can genuinely capture the tension and ruthless gore of the genre.

Good game, easily learned & played. But the lack of stacking and abstraction of building searches, plus repetitive action, limit it's score & replayability.

Mezcla perfecta entre Wargame "light" y juego cooperativo con la tensi√≥n de enfrentarse a los Zombies. Buen juego, perfectamente jugable en solitario aunque tremendamente m√°s divertido en compa√±ia.

Really great for solo play.  It seemed a bit fiddly to start with, but once I got the hang of the initiative role it played like a dream (also after I stopped spawning dozens of zombies with gunfire). 

Update:  Actually, after a few plays you realise guns are worthless due to the number of new zombies they spawn and the game becomes a bit of a slog, normally ending with 30 zombies stacked in your hex!  Still, the components are lovely.

I was asked to answer questions on the forum (and compile the FAQ), and I got some answers from the Head Shed, answers that shifted the balance of power to the zombies.  Now, instead of repetitively grinding down the zombie threat, the survivors have to keep moving.  Much more fun.

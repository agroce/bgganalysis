+ Vikings are cool; Concept of hidden worker placement is very intriguing.
- In the end there just wasn't much of a game in here; Very thin mechanics.


Why it's previously-owned:
The only real thing that this game had going for it was the hidden deployment selection mechanic; beyond that, it was very basic stuff and in the end, that wasn't enough to catch our attention.
I ended up trading this for Clash of the Gladiators.

RATING: 7
An interesting game design involving meeple allocations behind a screen utilizing player prediction analysis, then typically, attacking for resources with a seemingly novel combat mechanism wherein the attacker and defender play cards, then the played cards are effectively exchanged for subsequent attacks. Quirky and perhaps a bit too chaotic, this game certainly created some funny moments for us.

RATING: 5
{1 play • 4 players} Disappointing.  Once you lose a guy or two, your choices become so limited (especially if you leave a defense guy at home) that your moves kind of come down to how lucky you are at second-guessing.  Which is a shame, as there's some interesting stuff going on here.  Actually, come to think of it, the whole thing felt more like a prototype to me, rather than a fully realized game.  A pretty good prototype, but "unfinished" all the same.

RATING: 6
I was a bit surprised by this game.  It doesn't stand up and grab you as fantastic, but it doesn't leave you wanting your time back after playing.  Game play is likewise balanced between frustrating blind bids and smooth sailing.  In the end, the game is likely to leave you feeling both successful and beaten up all at the same time.  Game play can suffer if players gang up on one guy as recovery from a set-back requires a bit of luck (or really good planning) to avoid being where you are still the easy target to go for.  Likely is a tad underrated for those you like direct interaction and maybe high for those that find blind bidding and confrontation less enjoyable.

RATING: 8.5
Really clever and fun, one of my favorite Dirk Henn designs outside of Alhambra. It's kind of like a hybrid of soldier placement/siege, simple deterministic warfare where you select which resources you'll chase, and which opponents you'll attack behind a player screen, and then just watch the chaos erupt across the board. I also like the hospital track and how you refill your hands once you've spent all your cards in battle, and how you swap said cards during fights. The amulet card-swap rules feel a little wonky, but otherwise this is a great time.

Interesting game that I think will play better with a full complement of players. Strategies with card play is fairly subtle. As a result I find people aren't that interested when playing and a lot of the interesting decisions are missed by players.

What should be a simple family game is actually a few notches more complex.

Light majorities game where positioning is determined from behind your scheme.  Nice combat mechanism where your opponent inherits your attacking card, but can upgrade a limited number of times.  Reasonably engaging.  Works fine with 6.

I think this game is fun. I'm glad I gave it a second chance after it flopped the first time out. It's perfect for when you need a game with some conflict toward the end of the night when you don't want to expend a ton of brain power. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of strategic decisions to make, but you don't agonize over them. It's just fun to see what happens to your best laid plans.

This game has one thing going for it...The basic gameplay is extremely simple to grasp.  I like the fact that you just place your guys on your small board, then transfer them to the big board, then resolve any conflicts.  It flows easily and should be fully understood after the first round.  I also like the forced confrontations.  It's hard to have your feelings hurt too much, when you are almost required to go head-to-head with the other players.

What I didn't find quite so enjoyable about the game is just that it seems too long for what it is.  I'm sure with experienced players it would race by in a very reasonable amount of time, but with new players it can take well over an hour and a half to play.  Also it becomes too powerful if one player luckily selects the locations where no one else is going.  I realize this is part of the game, but someone can really start to runaway with the game if they just turtle in their own castle and run out to fields where no one else is going.  I also don't like the amulet thing, because it seems too risky to sacrifice points for the sake of a CHANCE at getting better cards.  I think it would make more sense if the amulets just strengthened a card directly.

All in all, I don't fing Eketorp to be a horrible game.  It's just not one that I'm anxiously looking forward to playing again.  If someone asked I would be willing, though.

RATING: 6.5
Although the game has a certain amount of chaos and randomness, the fact that it plays quickly and handles up to six players makes it an excellent choice for a super-filler and an alternative to a social game.

The mechanism of trading cards after a combat is clever, but ultimately this game falls into the fun category rather than the strategic one. This is not saying that there aren't any interesting decisions and there is room for clever play, but the chaotic nature of play may dictate the outcomes. Fun stuff with the right crowd!

The opponent can try atttack your home to steal some Bricks/Vps from you.

Rather light game with mechanics that are more refined in Dirk Henn's Shogun. Simultaneous hidden worker placement works well but is luck driven and fighting with cards increases the luck factor significantly. There's also good chance that leader gets beaten in the end since he/she can be left fighting with all the rest of the players.

RATING: 4
This takes probably my least favorite game element ever of bluff/double bluff, and then adds an extra layer of bluff/double bluff on top of it!

First, you secretly plan out where you want you guys to go.  If you guess well and avoid going where everyone else is going, you get whatever you wanted without having to fight for it.  However, if you end up with a crowd, fights are determined by playing a numbered card from your hand.  Higher card wins.  This is another bluff situation, as you're just trying to guess what number your opponent will play.

Furthermore, bluffing junk aside, there is a card exchange mechanism that just doesn't work so well.  To start the game, everyone is dealt cards from a deck of cards numbered 1-6.  For the most part, these same cards will circulate from player to player.  However, each player has 5 chits that allows him to trade in a card for a new one, meaning the low cards in the game are going to be replaced by better ones.  If players choose to do this, soon every card in the game is a 3 or 4 or higher, meaning there is not much variance in card values later in the game.  While I can see it was intended as a bail out for players with a couple low cards left, the side-effect of the mechanism is not so awesome.

Overall, the game boils down to a random bluff fest with a little beat up on the leader thrown in for good measure.  There are probably those that would like a game like this, just not me.

A fun game of sending your vikings out to gather natural resources or attack your opponents town to steal their resources. The thing is everbody is trying to do the same and there is just never enough to go around so fight after fight after fight determines the victors of the raw materials that you can use to build a wall around your hometown. 2 Plays.

Lots of guessing and out-guessing your opponents. Quite chaotic but not too long. The card swapping mechanic is clever.

RATING: 7.5
This is an interesting game with unusual mechanics.  Players secretly determine their actions, then all reveal them simultaneously.  It is a nice blend between worker placement, hidden decision making, and "take that" battles (that are easy and simple to resolve).  The battle system is very straight-forward, and well balanced.  A very fun game that I will try to get to table as often as possible, especially since it plays up to 6.

RATING: 5
Chaotic simultaneous action selection sending out warriors to collect resources combined with chaotic simultaneous action selection fighting of those warriors with your opponents warriors if they compete for the resources. It is just a bit too long for how chaotic it is. I think it could be improved by only building on three of the six wall sections. This would half the length of the game. It is a fun light combat based euro just not very satisfying.

Good game to have around as plays quite well with 6, although it can drag a little with that number.

It's certainly best to play with more than 3 as with fewer players there just isn't enough competition.

The game itself is fun and I enjoy the interactive elements, of trying to avoid being totally shafted while working out who to rodger yourself. The only problem is the way the rounds work - there are just too many and as they are basically the same it can get a little tedious unless everyone is on the ball, and a little flat.

I do like the card mechanism though. Good with the right crowd.

I wasn't crazy about this game, but take that opinion with a grain of salt.  Eketorp involves considerable amounts of direct conflict, which is something I don't enjoy.

But beyond the conflict there is definite strategic potential, if you can just manage to outwit your opponents by making hidden action choices that no one else picks.

This is an interesting little game that doesn't happen to be my cup of mead.

RATING: 6.5
a game which needs six players to play at its best.  This is a real take-that game.  Place your workers behind your screen then reveal them and move them onto the board in position.  On the board you attack other people to either gain resources or knock down their castle.  This is done through simple highest card wins play, with the loser retaining the winner’s card and vice versa.  

It makes for a very entertaining 45 minutes of second-guessing what everyone else will do and enjoying the light conflict.  And the rules are so simple it is a dream to explain and play.   So, good with light gamers, family (but some children may object to being attacked) and as a filler in a gamers’ evening. 

The game is available very cheaply these days.  

Hint: play the Ousgg variant found under varients on BGG, whereby you start with nearly half of your castle built. Played with the normal rules the game will outstay its welcome.  The marvellous Ousgg variant cuts around a third off the game time and gives a much more interesting start to the game.

After 1 play of the new Queen version with a full compliment of 6, I'm not too enamored with this one.  Shelley and I sat down to discuss the game (she played it twice in one day) in our 10/28/07 podcast at www.garrettsgames.com.  I actually think that the mistake made in Shelley's first game (using 8 meeples instead of the 5 mentioned for 6 players in the rules) will make the game better because there will be MORE conflict and more chances to get involved in many aspects of the board.  I won the game by a 6-point margin while getting involved in few conflicts and was bored.  That doesn't mean I won't give it another chance, however.

Nice game system. When you use your stronger card your opponent will benefit from it in a later stage because you discard in the opponents discard pile.

SOLD IT ($4)

I was originally drawn to the castle building element, reminding me of the various materials the three little pigs built their houses with. The higher card wins battle system is lame, but the card swapping afterwards is quite clever. High player interaction is a plus, but sadly it is quite hard to play a serious game since dumb luck (of where to place your Vikings) will always be more profitable in a volatile game such as this.

Another needlessly massive Queen box for the size of the game which takes up way too much room in an outgoing game bag, which if the game was portable, "might" garner a 6 rating from me.

If you enjoy games with guessing and bluffing, this may hit the spot.  If you are an analytical type, you will no doubt hate this, and probably sabotage the game to get it over with more quickly.

Me? - I'm in between and can at least understand why some will enjoy it.  There really isn't enough information to predict others' actions with any reliability, so you have to approach it as a light social game.  Probably improved by groups higher than mine in wackiness.  The mechanics are a mixed bag.  The card passing is a nice idea but gets a little old, but it is genuinely amusing when 90% of the vikings are in the hospital.

Queen edition. - Demoed at Essen, played my own copy now. Didn't work as a 3 player game, since I was the only one battling Mike and Mike started with a hand of high cards and Chris did NOTHING to help me except send more of my Vikings to hospital AND steal from my fort and when I used my Thor's amulet I swapped a 1 for a 2 and then a 2 for 2 while Mike swapped a 1 for a 6. It was so unfair.

Will play again with more people.

I own the DB Spiele version which suffers from really basic component quality.  The game however feels just right in the Queen version though, and the material is excellent.  My 5 player game was tension filled and I wouldn't want to play with less than that as the game centers around conflicts.  The way the combat cards are cycled is pretty neat.

RATING: 7
Rating is for a 3-player game of the original db-Spiele version. Material is sub-par, and using a sheet to write down actions feels weird, but outside of that it is a very well balanced simultaneous action game. I've heard it compared to Pirate's Cove, but with 3 players it is closer to Edel, Stein and Reich. The tactic here is mostly in deciding how many people to keep home and how many to send away. Card-based combats are quick and work really well, adding an interesting extra layer of bluff/tactic.

Eketorp is a game of bluffing and double-guessing with a bit of take that thrown in. Viking bands fight for resources to build their encampments with. Of course, rich encampments attract raiders, and walls that were raised are just as easily torn down again.

The game generally works pretty well. It does tend to run a bit long, however, mostly because of the direct player attacks. As a double-guessing game I prefer the shorter and purer approach of something like Pick Picknic.

A blind bidding game with a ho-hum card driven fight mechanic that offers neither anything new or anything resembling control.  Eketorp may offer moments of laughter, but each outburst is really the body having an involuntarily spasm to prevent the tears you feel you should be crying for wasting so much time.  And that's the other thing, this game lasts way too long.  The production values are superb, which seems to be status quo for Queen games but the game play is poor.  Aladdin's Dragons and especially Moai have a similar style of blind placement but the decisions in those games are strongly considered, and are not often as blind as they may appear.

Lavish treatment by Queen, but priced to match.  Good gameplay, but can be very random whether you have to fight or can walk away with wall pieces scot-free.  The attack-the-leader part does balance this, though playing with 6 may have caused it to drag a little.  Good if people play quickly.

Not a bad game.  It's mostly all conflict from the beginning to the end, but it's pretty lighthearted.  There's an element of bluffing as well.

Would like to play this again.

Not a bad game, and there are some interesting elements.  The first turn can seem like it lasts forever due to the many battles.  The battles aren't terribly exciting though, at least in my mind.  There's something antiseptic about the card plays that I can't put my finger on, but the upshot is I have trouble caring whether my vikings win.  It's like the battles in Dungeon Twister, which I also don't care for very much, but without the other redeeming qualities that make Dungeon Twister an impressive game.

I've played a few times now and have won by only concentrating on bricks.  Maybe I'm lucky at outguessing my opponents, but it seemed to be almost too easy.  For the most part, unless there is an easy pick... it doesn't pay to attack an opponent's structure.

I like the game and I'll play if requested, but it seems to be lacking something I really can't put my finger on.  I Must add that the new Queen version is beautiful and functional... and, because it plays with six players, it fills a gap that is increasing as a lot of newer titles only play with four.

An interesting, yet unoriginal game.  It feels similar to Hoity Toity with a battle system pasted on.  It seems like your best bet is to try to avoid confrontation (if possible), but the battles are quick and clean, and the card trading is interesting, favoring those with a good memory.  My main gripe with the game is the lack of a spark of greatness as well with a play time that is a little too long.

The game has many interesting rhythms.  You must adjust your strategy based on how many vikings you have this turn, vs how many your opponents have, how powerful your cards are, and the attractiveness of various targets.  The chaos level is just right for a game of this theme and length.  Finally, it rewards viking behavior.  I won my first game by launching raids on all of my opponents on the last turn, and leaving no one home to defend the fortress.

This was a very fun game of out-guessing. So far I love blind bidding, and this is all about it. I would play this again gladly. Sadly, half of the other 4 thought that this was bad and the other half only ok. Also; two variant ideas Jani came up with, to ease attacking players' forts:
1. More than one player could attack a wall section, and the defender would defend with one card against them both.
2. The wall pieces had one less defence value (with grass having either 0 or 1)

As we thought of it, I conceded that attacking walls might indeed be too hard. I never did it much.

A fun simple game that works great with it's max 6 players. Build your fort with better materials than others, but fights happen in a variety of different places.

Fun game where you have to protect your own camp from enemy attacks while getting new blocks (which generate points) from the central quarries. The game is mainly based on a blind placing mechanism where you have to guess what your opponents are going to do and adapt to that. But they are also changing their strategy and so on. So it will become wild guess and chaos pretty fast which can be fun for some but which is not my cup of tea.

Componentes are great and there is some strategy in it but not enough to rate it any higher.

This is the perfect game for those of you who complain about multi-player solitaire.  Eketorp has plenty of player interaction.  Unfortunately, there is more guessing than strategic planning.  The good news is this game appeals to my son who generally despises most eurogames.

RATING: 8
Eketorp presents itself as a Euro when in actual fact it stands much closer to Ameritrash.

The game is a combination of resource and card  management coupled with blind placement and high screwage.

Our games tend to be virtual Viking wars where very few viking pieces are usually left to take actions with from turn to turn. This coupled with the high amount of strategy involved makes for a satisfying and highly replayable experience.

In this Viking themed game, each player has a mat, and a player screen. Each player then secretly assigns vikings to tasks: 1) gather resources in the form of green bricks (1 VP) , brown bricks (2 VP), tan bricks (3 VPs) or gray bricks (4 VPs), 2) attack another player fort by sea, land or by boat, and 3) defend their fort. After everyone has assigned vikings, everyone reveals their locations, and vikings are put on the board. Wherever there are not enough resources to go around, battles are fought, with cards numbered from 1 to 6. Each player has a hand size of 4 cards, and must cycle through all their cards. The loser of the battle assigns their viking to the appropriate hospital, but swaps cards with the winner. The hospitals are a timing mechanism on when your vikings can come back to the game - e.g., if you lose by 3, 4 or 5, it takes 3 turns for your vikings to come back, if you tie, they come back at the end of the round. Players then take their plundered resources, and erect a part of their fort. There are 6 walls, which can hold a maximum of 3 brick, and the strength of the top brick helps when a person's fort is being attacked by another player. Each player also has 5 medallions, which are worth 1 VP each, or they can choose to use to exchange cards with the deck. Game ends after 10 rounds, or when someone has built 18 walls on their fort.

I'm not real fond of the blind bidding (where you assign vikings to resources then reveal to see if there are battles), since someone can get lucky by "outguessing" someone else. It's an okay game, and has some interesting mechanics, and clocks in at around 90 minutes.

Gamey mechanics to a degree, but ultimately a fair bit of luck/chance. Fun if not taken too seriously. Would play again in the hope of making the elusive 18-block castle, but I suspect that would be v unlikely.

Party-style secret deployment and card combat. There's nothing to get the blood pulsing for an experienced gamer, but it's a passable waste of time for 5 or - at a push - 6. Passing out some bonus building materials at the start (say, 1 clay, 2 wood, 4 grass) reduces the game time from 'too long for what it is' to 'entertaining and frantic filler'. A word of warning: if you leave your castle undefended at the wrong time, you will sit out much of the rest of the game.

Vikings fighting over building blocks for their strongholds is kinda funny and the gameplay backs it up. Simultaneous revelation of allocation of your vikings to either the resource gathering spots (some are more valuable than others) or to other people's strongholds to try and steal their blocks. If there's competition, duel it out by playing a card each (values 1-6), winner gets the spoils, loser goes to hospital and will return in a turn (or 2 or 3 ... depending on badly they got beat). In an inspired touch, the loser gets the winning card and the winner gets the losing card to balance things up in future. And it’s funny for everyone else when it's a draw and everyone dies. No strategy, just choose to try for the easy stuff (and hope no one else goes there) or whack a leader - and in another nice catchup, leaders will need to allocate vikings to defense of their stronghold meaning less vikings for getting more resource. But fast combat, fast turns, all over in 10 rounds, enjoyable as a romp, the more players the merrier.

Es divertidillo, sobre todo conforme avanza el juego y les vas robando material a los otros jugadores.

Luego la cosa se pone más divertida e interesante. Pero bueno, es un juego de VIKINGOS y hay que tenerlo, por lo menos yo.

RATING: 8.5
Fun game, with simple rules which actually make perfect sense.

The card exchanging may be ok, but on our first 3 player game, after spending a few of the amulets, we ended with all fives and sixes and a single four card. Combat was not fun that way, so we houseruled it so that any used combat cards get discarded and new ones are drawn.

We are considering downplaying the tactical (card-counting) element and introducing 1D6 combat to make the game more suited to our 6 year old. (Paying an amulet lets you roll a D10 instead).

Anyways, an excellent game alltogether.

Quite a bit of "in your face" conflict. For the resource spaces, or to directly attack another players home to steal the pieces they collected.

Like the card selection mechanic - with the twist the cards trade hands when played, a good card my come back to haunt you. 

Best to be countercyclical so your pieces go where they don't have the competition. Does make the game highly chaotic, as the players try to outguess each other.

Interesting bluffing game (both in terms of placing the meeples as well as during fighting). I can see how this game may fall flat if people become annoyed at backstabbing and random attacks but if you get into the spirit of crazy viking attacks and so forth, this is something for you.

Good simultaneous action selection game for up to 6 players.  However, the game isn't that interesting after repeated plays.  It also has a bit of a runaway leader problem (stemming from the number of uninjured vikings that survive turn 1).  I liked it a lot better after my first play than after my second.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Played once. The basic mechanism is the planning of actions (where to send your vikings) hoping to acquire as much as resources as possible. Since other players are trying to achieve the same this will result in some conflicts which are handled by battle cards. The higher card wins, but both players receive the cards of their opponent after battle. Beaten vikings go to the hospital where they spend some time depending on the injuries they suffered. It seems that fighting most of the time only helps the players who are not involved. However if you managed to do a sneaky attack on the village of your opponent ... :-)

Being a Viking is always fun!  There are some very well designed mechanics in a simple to explain game.  Basically there are limited resources for you to collect to help build a your town's fortifications, hence the conflict.  You can attack your fellow Vikings camp if you so choose.
The icing on the cake is the anti-bash the leader mechanic.  If there is a clear winner, as was in our game, those Vikings sent to bash that town, must first bash each other.  This lead to some fun end game situations.

We've played this a few times and no one seems to have worked out a good strategy. I like the mechanism whereby after a fight you exchange cards so when you want to win, it's by a small margin, but you can also try to sucker people into exchanging big cards for your tinies! The time I won I got no blocks at all in the first two rounds at all and I've no idea how I caught up! The first round goes on far too long (why not have everyone start with 1 randomly chosen brick so there's something to defend too?). It's very easy to gang up on someone (so play with people who like you). It's also very easy to cheat.

--Jul2008-- Let's begin with the basics: it's a lot of blind bidding.  One such (the viking placement) is the basic outguess-the-opponent with limited information:  that part reminds me (unfortunately, as it happens) of _Fist of Dragonstones_.  The other (combat cards) is much more interesting - but, as a whole, I'm not at all certain the game provides enough amusement to want often to play again.

Repetitive castle building game where you blindly place your vikings to either get resources from common supply or steal them from other player's castles.

RATING: N/A
From reading the rules, sounds like this might be quite fun. Looks like euro but is AT inside; resource collection with a simple, clever card-based combat mechanism. What sets this apart from typical euros for me is that not only do you collect resources, you get to take them from others too.

First impressions: It was really hard to predict where people would go. Though you had several options as to where you might possibly get some bricks, the decisions felt very similar each round. Could that be because we didn't pay attention to what cards everyone was holding? That was really difficult by the fact that you couldn't quite know when someone would pick up a new hand. So were you to keep track of cards, you'd have to do that for everyone differently. Everyone felt that it took too long for what it was; we likely went well beyond 45 minutes. Forecast not great.

The battle mechanism for this game is a brilliant idea. By swapping battle cards what goes around comes around - no more whinging about die rolls. To improve it even more you get to swap up to five cards during the game if you need something better for an especially important battle. Add to that the fact that there's many battles and you have balance. Add to that the hospital delay for injured troops and it's just very, very clever.

Here's the problem. Two problems:
1. That's it - there's just battle after battle - it's the whole game. It's not incorporated into much of anything else, so it kind of outstays it's welcome for a couple of rounds.
2. Placement is blind - which is kind of fun, and simple and speeds things up. But it's blind - so you have to be okay with that mechanic. Here it's not too bad, but again, it could have been more. After the brilliance in the battle mechanic it just lets it down a bit.

So, I really like bits of this. I'd happily play it again. I'm just a bit disappointed that the opportunity was missed to make this into something more.

RATING: 7.701
I think the game has some interesting possiblities for solo and team play. I liked Stone Age, but after playing that I wanted to kill or be killed, and this game certainly provided a bit of actual interaction. I would have preferred a dice modifier to the battle cards, but the battle card system seemed okay for a light Euro-type game such as this.  Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation and Dungeon Twister use similar battle card systems that I despise, but this one felt less card-counting, exacting, and chess-like and thus more fun.  I'm also generally not a fan of simultaneous guessing games like Hoity Toity and Pirate's Cove, but this one seemed to click for some reason.  

Additional: Remember to keep some Vikings at home so they don't all get wiped out the first round and needed to spend lots of time recovering in the hospital.

RATING: 6.8
A novel game with some original mechanics.  I like how you have to try to guess what everyone else is doing with the simultaneous action selection and there's an odd balance in how the cards get exchanged.  It can be pretty brutal, as there is plenty of conflict in this one.  It might be even an 8, although there are other games that I think I would suggest before this one.

UPDATE: While fun, I can't see it making the leap to an 8.

RATING: 6
1 play, in which one of the 4 of us had to leave so we played his actions randomly and he won! I think it was a fluke (no one attacked him, and our random strategy had him always going for material and never attacking us) but that's still kind of annoying! I would like to try this again -- it should play pretty quickly and was kind of an interesting game of random fighting, balanced by the fact that resources used to fight (cards 1-6) are exchanged after the fight so the loser will still (eventually) have a stronger hand to fight again. It's also got blind bidding of a sort, which I normally don't like. However, it's like Fischmarkt: everyone assigns their vikings to various locations behind a screen, then reveal simultaneously -- works fine.

Light and quick enough to try again some time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Reminds me of Hoity Toity in regards to the secret action mechanic where you're often trying to guess which area won't have a conflict, even if it's not the most advantageous place on the surface.  It also has a feature similar to the jailed thieves and has a type of blind auction to resolve conflicts.  I enjoyed it, although I don't see it as one that everyone will like.  It's just a little clunky and slow to rank with the elite games.

Interesting little game of placing Vikings to grab resources and kick down your neighbors walls. The rules were easy to grasp, but the strategy was a bit more elusive. I wonder how common it is for new players to be overly confrontational the first turn (like all four of us were), and then spend the second turn doing not much of anything because all their Vikings were in the infirmary? Play again? Yes! I don't want to own this game or play it a whole lot, but occasionally for some quick good-natured mayhem, I'd play this.

Let me get this right... these Vikings are doing their utmost to build walls around their villages, because the walls protect the villages by... er... distracting their enemies into stealing bits of the walls. Once the walls are gone, however, the unprotected villages now contain... nothing of value whatsoever. Interesting...
As for the game itself, it feels a bit random, and suffers somewhat from "attack the leader" syndrome, but it's still a good laugh in a chaotic kind of way. I miss it a bit now the owner's traded it away, but I couldn't see it getting many plays in our group anyway. If nothing else, it seems like it would make a great drinking game!

After waitng for two years to find a sale price on this one I finally snagged it and now I kick myself a little for having waited.

This is my kind of game - secret action selection combined with action drafting (worker placement) and the ability to mess with people (and be messed with).

There is a ton of bluff and double-think so I understand why others are turned off.  I like the luck introduced by dice and card draws and metagaming as long as the game is fast and fun.  I think it is fun looking over the board deciding if you will be competing for building materials, defending your fort or attacking another's (or a little of each).  It all depends on what you think others will do based on their position and needs.

This kind of interaction is great fun to me.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

A good, fairly light game that supports lots of players. I enjoyed the equalising mechanic of the winner and loser exchanging cards after each battle, ensuring noone stayed on the top for long. Choice of when to fight battles (relative to hand size and refreshing) is more subtle then you might think at first glance.

There can be an issue with play length if people are overthinking their move and not just rolling with the built-in give and take of cards.

Viking themed eurogame, set on Öland? 

Give me!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In Eketorp, players build Viking strongholds upon the Swedish island of Öland.

The goal of the game is to collect the most valuable blocks to build your own fortress, either by winning battles on the resource spaces or by stealing blocks from other vikings.

Each turn, new resources appear and the players secretly plan their viking movements. After all the placements are revealed, vikings battle each other for blocks (with the losers sent off to the field hospital to recover). The game ends after a set number of rounds, or when one of the players has succeeded in finishing their fortress.

Fluffy chaotic guessing game that neither overstays its welcome nor attempts to be more than it is.  There's tons of guesswork to hope that your Vikings are going somewhere that they can get goods without competition, and then also in playing your cards right so as not to languish in the hospital for too long.  Like the balancing mechanics of getting the cards played against you.  Wouldn't call it my favorite viking-themed game, as it is beaten by both [gameid=12495] and by [gameid=17449] for that title.  Still, theme is strong, though geographically abstracted.  For groups looking for light, thematic affairs, this is a good choice.

Dirk Henn (Metro); Category: Ancient, City Building, Bluffing;  Mechanics: Hand Management, Simultaneous Action Selection, Secret Unit Deployment; Viking strongholds are built upon the Swedish island called Öland; In the 2007 reprint by Queen games, movements are planned with meeples on then hidden player boards, not written down. Then all boards are revealed and the meeples are placed on the board according to the planning. Turns are reduced to 10 max (or one player completes his stronghold first).

blind deployment for limited resources, recycled combat cards, fort building in darkages scandenavia (sweden?) simple and fun with very nice pieces, carefully protect good resources or concentrate on getting as much rubbish as you can to finish quickly for the 5 bonus points,  ifn you have an awful combat hand talk to thor and  take a chance on getting better ones (wasn't Odin the norse god of war?) a very fun, simple, fast(ish) playing, quiet cheap game worthy of any collection

Cool Viking fort building game!  I had my eye on this game for years until I finally found it on clearance at Cardhaus and snatched it up.  

It's got simultaneous action selection in both the placement of workers and as combat resolution, so if that's not your thing, stay clear.  I like it though.  The combat mechanic is especially clever since you trade cards with your opponent after battle.  So if you lose a lot of battles early, you're likely to win some later.

We have added a ridiculous Swedish flag-adorned Viking hat as a starting player token.  Starting player wears the hat!

Really fun game when you have lots of friends over and just want to play something fast and quick but with plenty of interest, Eketorp really does provide that. My problem with it though is that I do find the combat is dull and not that great, it's too simplistic and is only good when you have 5-6 people (There's better games if you have less than that)

A good under-appreciated Euro improved with better components.  I have the original and the Queen/RGG versions.

Liked everything about this simple and interactive game.
The Board illustration is one of the best ever.

I'm disappointed. I really wanted a simultaneous action selection game, and this is so promising. But somehow the selection of actions are not balanced correctly, the healing track is too punishing, and there is very little development in the board. These three factors are weighing the game down. I'm going to try again, hoping that I'm missing something.

An enjoyable secret bidding mechanic which can lead to total chaos when playing with lots of people. Lacks in the fact that you need a lot of people to get the most out of it, but this also means that it will be absolutely impossible to plan and predict what the others will do.

Complete.
Played with 6 players and the variant that each player gets 3 grass, 1 wood and 1 clay to start with. Game ended in round 9 by one player with 18 bricks who finally won with 42-32-32-24-21-19.

Played at Essen 2007. Eketorp sounded good: Swedish theme, veeple, colourful board, plays up to 6. However, I wasn't too keen on the game itself: it was more about conflict and less about building than I would have liked. Conflict resolution is a simple affair of whoever plays the higher card wins, but the mechanic of giving your opponent the card you just played is a good one, leading to some interesting tactics.

RATING: 7
A very fun and quite clever little game of beating the crap out of each other (vicariously) and nicking building materials!

A game for when you want something silly, fairly chaotic and just entertaining, with some thought involved but not too much. And honestly, who could fail to love viking meeples (with historically inaccurate horned helmets!)?

RATING: 6.7
Nice little beat-em-up with a slight euro feel to it. I like how the used cards get swapped and the attacking mechanism works. We botched a rule where bricks are destroyed when attacking but it'd be cool to tear down someone's walls. I was distracted most of this game and would like to revisit it.

RATING: 4.5
Nice components, but a lot of blind guessing on what to do -- with more players, there's very little true strategy or outguessing your opponents on where to assign your actions. I do like the fact that combat cards cycle to other players throughout the game, so if you have a hand of bad cards, eventually they'll make their way to other players. Unfortunately, had a strong feeling of Pirate's Cove, with the fact that the player that is lucky enough to avoid conflict the most often has a huge advantage, despite the fact that there's no real rhyme or reason to avoid conflict, but a feeling of just luck.

No está tan mal, pero es simplemente un juego de bluf sobreproducido.

Much like Citadels, Eketorp is all about anticipating and predicting what other players will do.  

Cartoonish card art--in a game about Vikings!--was a minus for me.  Where's the carnage, blood, fire and fury?

Definitely best with 6p.  Interaction drops off steeply with fewer players.

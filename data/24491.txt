The art and aesthetics are gorgeous - from the striking cover image to the ship designs on the cards to the symbols on player tokens.

It may be the prettiest game I own.

Played it through a couple of times now and very impressed, it has a lot of intelligently designed mechanisms and the moving moons mean frantic struggles for points and influence.

It has, however, one of the strangest rulebook organisations ever, with much crucial information struck in the "components" section instead of the reasonable places like in the order of phases.

Realised it had not been played in most of a decase so Charitied to George Leach

This is actually a decent game, and as such, it should be much higher ranked on BGG.  

If you like Cosmic Encounter, Eclipse, or Tigris, you ought to try this game out.  The space theme is nicely implemented.

The combat is tile based (somewhat reminiscent of Tigris) and card determined (reminiscent of Cosmic Encounter and Fredereich).  I do love the original rotating moons mechanic.  The upgrade mechanics are reasonably interesting, as are the final round VP decision-making. 

On the other hand, I am not a fan of blind bidding mechanics in general, and in this game, blind bidding is used to determine who controls the effects of tile destroying solar flares.  What?  And the game is a bit long, and a bit fiddly.  Pruning this game back a bit, with some house rules, might make sense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty good.  Combat system isn't THAT unique, in my opinion (reminded us a lot of a variation of Friedrich).  But otherwise it was pretty good.  No real balance issues, plays well, pretty easy to learn (and probably to teach).

RATING: 7
Played prototype. Even with a few rules we got wrong this game is quality through and through. The Supernova mechanic is a ton of fun and add a small elemnent of screwage (just the right amount). Lots of different strategies to employ and I don't see myself getting bored of this game anytime soon. (granted will have to wait for publication) Good amount of conflict. Various cards in the game add a lot of spice to Supernova. With a few rules clarifications (promised by designer) this game will be a classic with our group. Everyone who played it regretted having to part with the prototype.

RATING: 5
An interesting space conflict game that ultimately feels a bit bogged down by some of the elements of play. The main culprit seems to be the battle card system which turns your very quick turns into multiple minute slogs. Special battle cards played simultaneously are also hard to resolve unambiguously. There are also some nasty turn order elements that come into play (flares, battles). I'm not a fan of the random flares as I can either save RUs in case a flare shows up OR spend my RUs to shore up my defenses, buy research and bump up my tech. If a flare doesn't show up, I've in a way wasted my RUs. Willing to play again.

Twilight Imperium lite.  Not really my fare, but I can appreciate its qualities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Initial reading of the rules does not give me a very good feeling.  There is blind bidding for the powerful Solar Flares and the random event of the powerful events.  I see the purpose of the powerful events as a catch up tool to gamble to see if you get lucky and get the beneficial event.  If you get the beneficial event, great you are back in the game.  If you get the detrimental event, then ah well might as well concede as you most likely have no way in catching up unless you can get 2 beneficial events to get you back up.  Another thing that doesn't sit well with me is how players have to determine what balanced map setup should be.  There is really not a guideline to assure a balanced map.  I guess this can easily be remedied by having an auction for turn order for the first turn to try to even things out.  The good thing is that the rules are short enough and should be easy to learn and teach.  Will give the rules another read through later on.

RATING: 5
Rules are poorly put together, but can (just about) be fathomed from reading and playing. 

However nothing new here. If you want a space themed combat game in the 2-3 hour timespan, look elsewhere first. Starcraft, Galactic emperor or Nexus Ops, although very different space themed games will scratch the sci-fi combat itch for you in a much more pleasurable way. 

Main problems are downtime (in 4 and 5 player games) and lack of abilty to tranverse to the opposite side of the hex board (the supernovea is in the way!!!) In all but a lucky card draw you can only attack your neighbours.

RATING: 6.2
Interesting and challenging game with a space sauce poured over it. In it's heart it's fairly abstract. Game rewards aggressive play and seems to be a constant flux of hexes changing hands. Very tactical game. No real long term strategy seems possible. First version of the rulebook is bad, very bad.

While there were some interesting mechanics in this game it was just no fun. That's also the reason it didn't get played anymore after the first play. Traded it away.

Initial impression.

The game is not terrible, but the battles are ridiculous.  Since they are such a large portion of the game, I do not enjoy this one, and won't readily play it again soon.  Was hoping it would be a far better offering.

The "pre-order bonus" was a joke.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I was frustrated that some of the visual design work on this game made it look space opera-ish, but in fact it is more of a competitive puzzle game, not well-linked to the theme. It makes very little sense to me to control empty areas of space into which a moon might happen to pass to score an abstract victory point... That said, I don't doubt that there are depths of strategy this game can attain and that some gamers will love it.

RATING: 6
Another thematically promising game eurofied into blandness.  As a tile laying exercise it's good.  As a game of space exploration and intercivilization warfare, not so much.

RATING: 7
I really enjoyed this medium-weight space conquest game. The basic hex-placement control mechanic is made more exciting by the fortification mechanism and the moving moons, which make players fight over their board position with future turns in mind. The research tree is useful without being intrusive, and the planet ability cards add a layer of strategy to the mid/late game. Overall, it's not breaking any new ground in game design, but it's a lot of fun and doesn't take a whole weekend to play. Would definitely play again.

Chris' Tips: I think Supernova is fun to try once, especially if someone else paid for it and you're in to the whole genre of space economic conquest, games, but: Stick with the short game. Avoid the "standard" game like the plague unless you've already played a few times and know you're up for it. The short game is already a touch on the long side. Stick with 4 players; with 5, the downtime can be painful. Keep the game moving. It's not rocket science; it's a mix-em-up slugfest, and needs to move along to be fun. And get the FAQ. The rules aren't quite as bad as they're made out to be, but they are pretty bad, and there are a couple of areas where things are genuinely un or underspecified.
---
Yeah, this game is rather clever, but it's just not there. The battle card system is not quite right, the research cards are a little uneven, and it's conflicted over the length. The design really needs the game to play out for a while, but the battle cards are swingy and players get hammered and the game is a bit repetitive and even the short game really is too long already; I can't imagine playing the "standard" game.

I dunno. I really like a lot of stuff in this one, it has many elements that are clever, but unless we can figure a way to tighten the screws I see it getting relegated to the closet.
---
I played this one, I actually liked it personally, but it seems like it's in an awkward spot between euros and more wargamey stuff and I'm not sure where it finds its audience. Probably more on the euro end; it's at its heart a tile-laying/auction-ish game. I liked the blend assuming you can live with the awkward rules and paper over a few interaction problems with the special battle cards, both of which are surprising and disheartening to find in a finished product. But, play the short game, and stick to 4 players, probably *exactly* four players. The short game with 5 players is still a couple hours, which honestly is too long already. In the three-player game, one player gets to be Poland, as described by a friend, which is not awesome obviously.

This sort of game needs a bias for action, but Supernova may have actually gone *too* far, made attacking too lucrative and defense almost impossible (admittedly, this is a far better problem to have than the 90% of these sorts of games where the defense is too strong, and people end up just staring at each other). It's unduly random for its length, again it's just souped-up diplomacy, but the moons are clever and it's graphically nice. Many cards are unfortunately vague. On balance, it feels a little half-baked, I honestly don't think the total package really works all that well, but it is clever, and it is unusual, and it is visually appealing, and it'll be good for a few plays. But it's hard to recommend. All else aside, I think the back-breaker is the length, especially with more players. Even in the "short" game.

Last thing in this random assortment of thoughts, I'm considering removing the "gray" wild cards from the battle deck. They just seem too weak. Sets are not so hard to make that having a wild card is helping much.

Final final thing, I actually do kind of like Supernova. But it's got to move along at a decent clip, and it's undeniably not going to be to everyone's tastes.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after a single 3 player game. Maddeningly ambiguous rulebook combined with a less than ideal 3 player game produced less than stellar results in my initial game. This despite the fact that we started with version 2.2 of the rulebook. The main controversy centered around when tiles are layed vs when battles are resolved, combined with the battle card replenishment. This is crucial, and seems to confuse just about everyone.

Once that issue is resolved, the game is decent. Technology in each of four areas is beneficial, but not necessarily decisive, which is good. There are definitely some hard decision points in how to spend your tiles and resource units, which provides some interesting tension. Battle is a little kooky and reminiscent of [i]Maria[/i] but, given the abstract nature of the game, acceptable to me.

Current verdict: Want to play again with four or more before rendering final judgement.

It's still a "prototype", but definitely has potential.  The game works.  And in fact the final two turns (there are nine turns in the game) were really good - if only the rest of the game was as much fun, we might have a real winner on our hands.  I'll post a session report on this with some ideas...

I played this game at a convention a couple years ago when it first came out.  There was a lot of hype or great expectations surrounding it at the time, and while I enjoyed playing it I forgot about it amongst all the other convention festivities.  

Now cut to 2010, the game has been on my mind lately.  I've decided after many TI3 plays, and playing Galactic Emperor that Supernova was a pretty darn good game.  I remembered it being a unique experience, so I bought it.  In fact, now, I believe it's unique approach to the space game is rather marvelous.  It's not an epic game like TI3, but it's not forgettable like many Euro games that come and go.  It lacks a bit of thematic chrome, which is probably why it was dissed by it's probable audience.  Space Gamers LOVE chrome.  Star Fleet Battles anyone?

I will start by saying that the rulebook out of the box, are absolutely horrible!  So much so, that I re-organized the rules to this game and added clarifications from FAQ's/Forum questions/conversations with the designer.  My first draft is the foundation for what will be the 2.0 rules for the game.  Click here for more info:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/393909

Now that's all fine and dandy, but what did I think of the game when played with the proper rules?  This game is savage!  I don't know if it's the dynamic of our group but it ended up in a lot of aggression, starting on round two and continuing throughout.  The mechanisms of the game really dissuade people from turtling too much.  The card driven combat and various technologies are pretty interesting.  I think my biggest issue with the game right now is that the research cards and super power cards do not feel balanced very well.  After further plays, I've decided this one runs a little too long for the amount of enjoyment I get from it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a bad game, but not overly exciting. If I want a space battle, why would I pick flat cardboard and cards, when I could play something epic like Twilight Imperium 3 or Star Trek: Fleet Captains? It's too bad that there are so many other great games out there, because I just can't imagine pulling this down when other games are just more fun.

I enjoyed my first try but it wasn't without a few frustrations.  Anytime I see a stack of random effect tokens, I always cringe in apprehension; it usually means that the players getting hosed early lose an edge which can be tough to surmount.  There are some neat elements, I like the combat mechanic as it is necessary to find an abstract way to get this done so the game doesn't crawl too much.  In our three player game, one player went into turtle mode and invested heavily in engines and defense and ultimately won by a comfortable margin.  I don't think this would be the same every time, but there seems to be many ways to achieve victory in this game and I'm curious to play this again.  We really struggled with the rule book though...

I played a lot of new games at BGG.CON 2008, including a lot of games I'd rate an 8 or 9 (Dominion, Space Alert, Le Havre, etc.), but my best gaming experience by far was playing Supernova in a tournament set up by the designer, Oliver Harrison. I didn't know what to expect going into it, but I ended up absolutely loving this game.

This game is exactly what I would look for in a dice-less confrontational wargame experience, but with many Euro-style mechanics that regulate the balance and increase the tension. There are many clever things that I like here, and almost nothing that I don't like:
- There are many different reasons to start a battle with an opponent, as various places on the map have significance (planets for victory points, moons that circle around the planets for income and victory points, encounter token spaces, etc.) It's not just a matter of grabbing up whatever space is most convenient to acquire - you are fighting over hotspots (some of which move) and for access routes to important territory.
- Each player almost always has access to start a fight with any other player, since you can always start battling from the supernova outwards. This can help keep the leader from running away with a victory, as everyone else will work together to keep him down.
- Timing and controlling the turn order plays an important role in the game.
- The artwork is amazing! Congratulations to Mike Doyle for a very functional design that is pleasing to the eyes, but doesn't draw too much attention to itself.
- The board develops in 3D, which looks cool, but also plays an important role in game play. Tiles will be built up on various spaces as battles are waged across the board, with an occasional tower being constructed for important pieces of real estate. Unlike Java, the heights of the terrain actually means something and can play in important part in defending territory.
- The dice-less combat resolution using cards allows for some luck, but can be strongly influenced by each player. The tension of deciding which cards to play in a battle can be excruciating, and it's as close to playing mini games of Poker within a different game as I've seen.
- In any given single battle, a weak player still has a chance of beating a strong player if they have prepared for the battle. This does not mean it is chaotic - there are very significant advantages to being a strong player in the lead, but it does mean that no one is ever completely out of the game.
- The game allows for very different styles of play, with a mini tech-tree that gives bonuses for attacking, defending, number of tiles to place on a turn, and number of cards in your hand which are used for various functions, including attacking and defending.
- Each player has a special ability in the game, which they can choose not to use for extra victory points at the end of the game. These special powers seemed pretty well balanced.
- There are several things to use money for, which makes for a lot of difficult decisions. Do I save it for the research cards, use it to bid for controlling the solar flares and bid for controlling turn order, or save it for victory points?
- The theme of the exploding star is unique and plays an important role in the game. Using a solar flare as a weapon against your enemies is just too cool.
- The modular boards mean that every game can be set up differently.
- It only lasts for 9 turns, which can take anywhere from 2 hours to 5 hours, depending on the number of players with AP. 

I think this game will be a big hit with the type of gamers who like confrontation in their Euro-games (Euphrates and Tigris fans for example) and should please a lot of Ameritrashers as well. I hope that a lot of people look into this game and are pleasantly surprised by it! It's publication has been delayed, but the wait will have been worth it, trust me. All of the people I played with in the tournament enjoyed it so much that they were going to get their own copy.

alright...i love that this game is all about combat and confrontation with the potential of emergent partnerships.  but my love stops there.

the flow and rules are very clunky.  way too much downtime between turns...even if someone battles you - "hey...i happen to have 4 wilds in my hand and i lose to your one five and discard my highest card. and that flip of the coin keeps landing on peace so i just can't seem to get the chance to bid for first player in order to raise my shields before you get the chance to draw up to your maximum hand size (and get absurdly great cards) and come at me again."  

yep...this game relies a bit more on luck of the draw on the cards than i care for. i mean...i could handle it if it was designed to run faster and i wasn't wasting my time sitting around for 3 hours drawing terrible cards and watching the flip of a coin.  you have a game that runs that much on luck, it better not take this long.

i wanted to poke my eyes out after looking at the artwork or lack thereof for hours on end.

A pleasant surprise. I'm not sure why this game has a bad rap. The new rules are fine and explain the game well. A good 4x space game with multiple ways to score points and different strategies to pursue. The only downside is the down time between turns. I would like to play this one again and try out more some different strategies. This is a fun game you can pick up for fairly cheap.

Crappy space exploration/space war game. Tile laying is bland.  Battles are mindless and have little strategy.  Decisions on what to purchase are interesting, as are the special power cards.  Rest of the game sucks.  Mechanisms discourage you from attacking because it leaves you weak.  Lots of downtime with five players.  It all feels totally half baked. One of the most under-developed games of the year. Probably going on the trade pile.  

First play we got a couple rules wrong.  It was better that way...  that should tell you something.

RATING: 5.5
Supernova looks like an abstract, and in many parts, it also plays like an abstract. The card-based combat certainly looks like it rewards hand management, and the planet and moon based resource mechanics are pretty neat, encouraging conflict while rewarding good defenses. And the tile laying mechanics are cool.

But, a lot of luck enters the game in three ways:
1) Combat cards and combat in general are pretty random after all. You can do some limited hand management, but you depend a lot on what cards you get, and the many different combinations make it very random how good you'll be in combat after all.
2) Technologies (the ones you research) vary greatly in power, some are very helpful while others are totally situational.
3) The bonuses you get from holding planets vary greatly in power as well. It's been a while, but I seem to remember that one of them was a lot stronger than all the others in our game, while another one was basically useless.

Furthermore, if more than one player attacks the same opponent before he can refill his hand (the one card free refill doesn't count), he won't stand a chance in later battles. Thus bashing the leader is a very viable strategy, and there isn't much he can do about it.

Don't get me wrong, these things aren't technically [i]bad[/i]. That ganging up on the leader is viable reduces runaway leader syndromes, and you can always go for planets you want early on, you're not stuck with your initial choice - and how many planets there are depends on the solar system layout as well, which is very flexible. The things I mentioned are just different from what my group (including me) expected after looking at the components and I had read / explained the rules.

I'm looking forward to giving the game another go myself. I'm sure there's a gem in there. It's just not an easily reachable one.

3 to 5p (4 best).  3hrs.  Weight 3.0.

[q="cfarrell"] So, I've played Supernova 3 times now. Most of the players I've played it with have found it a clever game, but somehow close, but not quite; most of us agreed a couple minor house rules would be necessary to get it on the table again. I've felt since the first pay that it needs a couple tweaks to put it over the top, but now I have some suggestions.

There are I think 5 key problems:
1. The draw of the battle cards can be incredibly swingy because of the huge variance in card strengths and the difficulty in cycling cards
2. The High-impact battle cards have a bunch of confusing rules associated with them, but often seem to be weak to useless to actually harmful, but hard to get out of your hand
3. Comms seem under-powered
4. Intermediate scoring seems very coarse, while end-game scoring is almost too fine.
5. Even the "short" version runs a bit too long.

Fortunately, I think these are potentially easy to tweak.

1) and 2) It pains me to suggest it, but I think the High Impact Battle Cards should just be removed from the game. The Power Inverter is a terrible card, always worse than just drawing a 3, plus it can actually hurt you. Dual Seeker is always worse than just drawing a 4 or a 5. Only the Smart Bomb seems definitively OK, but again almost all the time you'd be better off just drawing a 4, and you'd always rather have a 5. The additional playing restrictions on these cards also make them constraining. If they were powerful but hard to play that would be one thing - but they seem just average battle cards that are hard to play and introduce a bunch of awkward rules grit. If we wanted to keep one, we could just keep the Smart Bomb and ditch the other two.

1) Instead of fiddling your hand in step 5 if no battles occured, just let a player discard as many battle cards as he or she would like and draw replacements. Then in the purchasing phase, for 1 RU you can draw three, keep two, and discard one - allowing the player to hold extra cards over their comm limit. Or something along these lines to make this purchase a little more worthwhile.

1) and 3) Allow the players to replenish to the Comm level in 1) and then in 3c) of their (not opponent's) turns. You still just replenish to 4 on other players' turns.

On the flipside of this, if you play an invalid hand, you have to form the strongest valid set from the cards played and take the rest back into your hand instead of discarding them. In my games, invalid hands became a key way to get rid of useless HI battle cards.

4) For end-of-phase scoring (phases 1 and 2), you get a half-point for each occupied hex on the board. It's not a lot, but it would make intermediate scoring slightly more interesting. At the end of the game, you don't get points for RUs. As it is currently, players are always trying to figure out whether spending an RU will bring them a point or not; it's not terrible but not great either and it slows the game down. This way you just have to worry about saving for the final flare instead of balancing every expenditure.

5) We solve this by tightening the screws on the rest of the game so that the length isn't as much of a problem

Muy buen juego de pegarse palos en galaxias distantes. 
A diferencia de otros del estilo, la guerra está de sobra justificada y no zurras al compañero por hacer algo, esto evita nadie se enfurruñe ya que por lo general, uno entiende que haría lo mismo en el caso del contrario.
Por otra parte es facil recuperarse de un ataque ya que tus principales recursos están en tu tablero individual en forma de progresos tecnológicos que no te pueden robar (bueno, un poco si, pero eso es otra historia).
Hay muy poquito tiempo de espera entre turnos, mas que nada por que no es raro que un mismo jugador ataque a uno o dos adversarios diferentes, de esta forma todos "participan" en el turno del jugador activo.
El sistema de combate basado en cartas es emocionante, aunque tengo admitir que tengo debilidad por los juegos con este sistema. Y también hay que decirlo, el grafismo de este juego me encanta.

RATING: 6
First played January 6th, 2010. Taught in 15-20min, played in 2.5+ hours with 5 players. This game has lots of strategy and some luck. It appears that some elements of the game make this more luck driven and not enough balance. The board is created to give everyone a chance at a planet and moon (5 players, 5 planets/moons) around the Supernova center. There are also special tiles with special resources to be randomally be gained as well. Players are given two resource crystals and 4 battle cards to start. Battle cards are of 4 colors ranging 2-5 in value + a wild set each worth 1. Two types of battle cards have no value and can only be played with like color, and only one may be played in battle (swap highest cards and card has value of your highest value card played -1) Three phases are played with a number of rounds in each phase (4,3,2 rounds). To play a shorter game, remove one round from each phase. A start player is chosen at random at the begining of the game. Each player has a reference sheet showing their technology advancement. On your turn, you 1) refil you battle cards to your max (starts at 4); 2) recieve income (1 crystal + 2 for each moon you control; if another owner controls it's planet, then you must give one to them); 3) place tiles connecting to the center or another one of your tile placed. You get 4 tiles initially. You may fortify the first tile (stack on top of a previous tile; if planet then it costs two tiles; discard 2nd; aides in battle) If you place on someone else's tile, it becomes a battle. Each place up to 4 battle cards face down (one or more at a tile) then resolve battle. Highest number wins with defender breaking the tie. The value of defenders' sheild and attackers weapons is added in for result. Also if there is any height advantage in tiles, that is added in to higher stack. Defender wins, remove tile. Attacker wins, tile remains on top of defenders tile. After battle, each player is given one battle card and the active player may place another tile if they have any left. If they lost, they may re-attack the space. If you place in a space with moon or planet or special space, place your tile under them. If you place under a planet, you take that planet's special ability (+2 to attack, etc). If you take control of a special space, take that action if required to be done immediatly and place a new special ability. Later in the game (phase II?) you may exchange 2 tiles for a special ability. Refill your hand limit. 4) You may purchase Technology advancments shields, weapons, engines(attational tiles), comms(additional battle card hand limit; get 1 card immediatly). If you have both sheid and weapon, you get a bonus upgrade by one in both. You may buy Research cards to be used in a future turn at the cards' desingated time. At the end of your turn you may exchange a battle card if you did not do battle. --- At the end of each round the supernova disc is tossed and may (50/50 chance) cause a supernova (clearing a certain number of tiles removed). Next the moons move in orbit one space. At the end of each phase, a supernova happens regaurdless and the person who decides which tiles are removed is bidded on (ties go to battle; where battle cards are played). For each phase, that number of tile spaces (all tiles in each space) are removed from the board. --- At the end of each phase, scoring occurs with players controlling planets get 5pts, and moons 3 pts each. Next the player decides who will be start player for the next phase.

For the life of me, I can't see why this has such a low ranking here on BGG.  It has undeservedly received a bad-rap.  Mothertruckin most likely explained it correctly:  people take it out on party night not having read the rules (WHICH YOU MUST, SEVERAL TIMES) and try to slog through a 5 player.  This game is excellent, but requires some reading.

There are some nuances regarding rules that need to be ironed out, but once done, the game is superb.  1st play was with 3, but I'm thinking 4 or more is where it shines.  - Later note:  tried a learning game with 4 and it took significantly longer, but as people were figuring out the mechanics, it sped up.

I look forward to purchasing and subsequently playing this game when it comes out.

I don't know why this isn't creating more buzz. It's a very good game. After one play I enjoyed it very much. Rating could increasing if subsequent plays reduce playing time. Can have a fair amount of downtime if players get too involved in deciding what to do. Keep it moving everyone.

we liked this game... perhaps it would be better to redesign the "faces" of races... They are not so good looking. In our opinion the graphic should invite you to choose one intesad of another (as in Twilight Imperium) not to just "random choose" races because no one is good appealing!!! :D

While the theme is wonderfully realized in Mike Doyle's fantastic art the game itself is a shallow slog. The 180min playing time is laughable; the game routinely runs over 4 hours and comes down to who drew better cards.

Disappointed me to play this game after reading good news about it.  I think that the Hex area mechanic is nice in the sense that you can cut-off access to moons and planets, but the implementation of the Research cards is sorely out of sync with the research tree feature.  The game certainly looks sci-fi-ish but it feels like a beer-and-pretzels game; very random.

Played once, 4 players.  This game takes all of the things I hate about traditional Ameritrash and adds one Euro-ish mechanism (periodic scoring).  The concept I hate most about these kinds of games are - A PLAYER CAN BE TAKEN OUT BEFORE THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO PLAY!  In our game, one player had effectively been eliminated before their second turn.  And not because they made a mistake.  The game's "catch up" mechanisms are very weak, and really don't compensate for a hideous board position.  Finally, there is EVERY reason to beat up on the loser in this game - you want their resources/money, and it's easier to get it from them than anybody else.  Of course, they're now even further crippled.  And, as usual, combat is a near random affair - draw 4 cards, play them.  Do they happen to match up better that your opponents?  What a brilliant strategy!  A different ruleset, with more balance, is totally possible for this game.  But without some serious changes, I will never play this again.  This is one of the biggest disappointments of my gaming life.

Supernova has a good many things going for it. #1 I really love the fact that you are not just safe collecting your resources for moons because the moon moves every turn. #2 I love the tech, it adds a nice ah-hah moments in the game. #3 The graphic design for the game is nearly flawless. Too bad Mike Doyle isn't doing any more board games. There are unfortunately a few problems with the game. It is particularly slow, and prone to severe downtime if you play with players who are either AP inclined, or have problems figuring out what to do with the multitude of options you do on your turn. I wonder if removing the interaction tiles would speed up the game some, and I hope that a more streamlined game could be find in there somewhere. Overall I enjoyed the game, but just found that it dragged too much to really enjoy it.

I played the prototype of this at BGG.CON '07.  It was a bit of a disappointment: there weren't any interesting decisions to make.  I went away with the feeling that it was a good start to a good game but that it lacked the particular element(s) or mechanic(s) that would make it worth playing instead of other similar games.  As it stands, I would rate it a 6.

OK the card battle system is what drags this game into the depths of hell.  Other then that I think it wasn't too bad.  I would much rather have put my trust in some sort of Dice mechanic.  You can come in with a HUGE army against a single fleet and the other player plays a card that switches the cards from highest to lowest and you can lose.  

I would rather a system where as you progress you get better dice and then you can roll or something.  Ugh I just am soooooo disapointed.

Enjoyable conquests+expansion space game, with a good touch of a civ development/bonuses. The downtime is tangible which is probably my biggest and only complaint. Something that should speed up with experienced play(ers). Not too complex, but the game does possess some good, suspenseful and balanced mechanics, primarily in the battling system.  Not simply because of the current battle, but you have to consider the next attack. So it sets you up to have to determine if your opponent is staging a decoy attack or not. Quite good really.

After first play with 3 I know this game should be played fast, otherwise it takes too long.

I will preface by saying the game I played I did very poorly and was absolutely slaightered, so it may be painting a glummer picture than deserved, but I did not think much of the game.  When you fell behind, I could see little way to recover.  You have less cards to use, and attacking the leader trying to weaken them only ends up depleting your own hand to the benefit of the last players.  The leader will have better attack ability which gains you extra funds to bid on the supernova, which allows you to destroy the losing player's spaces.  I liked the techs, but wish there were less duplicates.  The game seemed to kind of disappear after publication, and I can see why.

Unique and fairly abstract-feeling war game where players are trying to claim territory on the board and take over planets and moons.  There are a ton of mechanics: auctions, tech-track, card-play, special powers, etc. and they all work together fine just don't get too far behind because it's tough to catch-up as board position is very important and the leaders will be gaining more income which can be used for a variety of purposes.  I would love to see more games from this designer.  For my tastes this one is too long for what it offers.

Ehh...Some nice stuff here, but too long for what it is.  Also too complicated for such a simple game.  I guess fiddely is the word I am looking for.

The swing from good to bad may be a little too much.

Long-ish for my tastes (about 4 hours), but not bad. I think I would prefer this playing the shorter version. (Skipping round 2)

Enjoyable, I like how the upgrades work. I *kind of* like the combat system. Although sometimes you really are at the mercy of the draw, at times. But, you mitigate by upgrading your comm for larger hand size.

No matter how strong you entrench yourself, it seems really easy for an opponent to come in and fuck all your shit up. 

VERY important to keep this in mind at all times.

Enjoyed it enough for a first game. Not too complicated to learn. Derek had to leave early with his copy so we didn't finish. However, just from one play I sense the replayability will be limited. We realised that the technology tree is skewed toward one type of strategy. The special alien powers are way unbalanced in comparison to eachother. There are too many rule ambiguities. The rules are horribly written and we kept coming up with questions about rules that had no answers in the rule book. I can't see this being a long term game.

There's a lot to like in this game.  The area control elements and the moving moons provide a lot of interesting game interactions.  It can bog down in the last few turns however.

After playing the newly released VG version I must say I really enjoyed this game.  It's very dynamic and full of action.  I enjoy the released version much more than the prototype I played.  There are still quite a few fiddly rules and min-maxers can make this game take a long time. 

Ultimately the game doesn't have much staying power.

--Feb2009-- There's potential here...  We had several confusions that weren't covered by the rules as stated.  And it's quite possible that the game won't work when we understand it better, too.  But at this point, I'm intrigued and would be happy to try it again.
--Mar2009-- Ok; that was the first play.  In truth, the only problem with the game that I can see is that the rules, as presented, are rather poor:  it's very very easy to play the game incorrectly, and - at least in my opinion - the game system isn't robust enough to work when one doesn't get it right.  On the other hand, when played correctly, I think this is really pretty cool.

Not the excellent gameplay I was hoping for. I really don't like how repeated combat boils down to who happens to draw a better hand of cards.

I very much wanted to like this game.  It is billed as something of a eurowargame, which usually excites me. For me, I was let down by the fact that it exuded the worst qualities of both design styles.  

I found this to be mostly an abstract game where you are laying your pieces down to claim hexes much like Through the Desert.  There was little story to the game, you just place pieces in hexes deep in space.  Sure there are objectives, but that is only to score points, not for a narrative.  The Tech Tree is merely a chart for simple modifiers. The races are the same.  The only individuality that the game offers is bonuses from discovered planets and from research.  Sadly, when you use your research you lose it and with it your individuality.  

On the flipside, this fails to be a great pure abstract not just because it moves from being deterministic into a the random. Combat is just a number rummy game with a couple twists.  Drawing better cards is ... better. That said, there was some entertaining ways to manipulate your hand. Regardless, I thought that Tempus did this better.

It is tough to take even as a lighter Euro, because it suffers from all age old problems that most Multi-player wargames have been plagued by. The second place player should be hitting the leader, but it is easier to take out the guy farther in the pack.  There is a rich get richer system here where money translates into tech, which translates into a greater attacking/defensive power (in a four flavors).  There is catch up mechanism that helps a bit, but it really isn't going to keep you close to the Joneses. 

In addition, this game suffers from what was the biggest weakness in Sword of Rome.  All players have the potential to earn an equal number of points in a turn, when an attacker takes one person down they get the difference in points.  So, in order to even catch up, the defender must take back twice as much from the offender -- from a considerably weaker position.  When you throw an economic earning parallel to the point accumulation, the whole thing gets thrown out of whack.

It is easy to recognize that you are in an unwinnable position early on.  What is the right thing to do?

1 Play and keen to try again. Lots of bashing, in fact not much else you can do. Looks fab  and probably takes 2 hours when you know what you are doing.

A game with a lot of potential, but the five-player full game drags on for hours, with most of the time spent watching and waiting.  In three-player games, the player stuck in the middle has a huge disadvantage.  I like the complexity, but the average first-time player will find the volume of rules overwhelming.

Abstracted 4X game that race forward during the first half of the game then bogs down to a crawl due to the battle card management. 
Down time accelerate as the board becomes clogged and more agression is played out.

I would rather exchange the battle cards with dice to speed the game up.

I was so looking forward to this and was a bit dissapointed (in fairness after only 1 play).  It's not that there's anything wrong with the game - it just seems to be a fit too fiddly and too long for what you get.  There are better area control games out there.  Having Small World become available shortly after this probably didn't help, as I feel that's a better game for a similar mechanic (even though Small World is also quite fiddly).

FIRST PLAY

Wow.  I have heard great arguments from both sides of the fence on this game.  It is too long, the battle/resource management mix of different paths to victory is wonky, muddy rules, great combat, immersive gameplay, you name it.  And it is all those things.  

Our first 3P game went 2.5 hours--and we played the short game.  The rules are so incredibly unclear that it blows my mind that this was just released this year.  Hard to explain, but man they are so muddled and tossed together.  

Components are beautiful.  However, my main boards have all suffered a bit of warpage, which is not uncommon for a title from VG (I am looking at you, Container...). 

SECOND PLAY

Oh boy.  I don't care who you are playing with, there is no way that a game like this should stretch over 5 hours with 5 players.  Maybe it should, but it is not worth it--not for that amount of time.  The downtime is immense, and incredibly off-putting.  Depending on the variable turn order, a player can literally go 45 minutes between turns.  My group tends towards the slow side, but c'mon.  

What is tough is that there seems to be a good game buried in there somewhere.  Because of the incredible tilt towards battle, the game just tends to get skewed.  Planning and implementing any sort of strategy can be rendered useless because of a solar flare or one or two players snowballing with their power.  There are some clear balance issues, between special powers and colonization bonuses.  

And then there is the sickening length.  Downtime in a game like this should not be so great.  It is not an epic game by any stretch of the imagination, yet it plays like one--in length only.  The game can simply drop into a lull of doing the same things over and over again.  

I am not going to trade it--yet.  But I really don't feel like playing it again for quite some time.

And why in the world can't Valley Games get someone to print their games without having boards and cards curve, curl, and warp?  The game would be stunning to behold, but the warp in the cards and boards is stupid, wrong, and off-putting.  Boo.  Seriously.

This is a gem for people that like games like Risk 2210 or Twilight Imperium. Components are very nice and functional (but you need to get rid the tray so you can store everything in the box). The game has simple rules, is well balanced, allows for some really smart moves, and one can say it is a streamlined and better version of Twilight Imperium. It is a long game (runs around 5 hours for 5 people), but a lot of excitement and the end is always a tight race.

Wow.... Had to trade this away to keep bad blood from creeping up in the family. Son and brother were about to come to blows over this one. For a Euro-style war game it sure tends to bring out the battle lust! The problem is that the game goes a bit longer than it needs to letting the simmering feelings to go to a complete blow-out.

Interesting take on building, improving, fighting but I did not see anything new. Movement is like the pirates in Rum and Pirates. Fighting is card play. Use all different colors or all of the same color. Card draw quality can be very random. Capture moons and planets for income. Use income to improve offense, defense, hand size, or movement. OK for what it is but I don't want to play it anymore.

Now that the game is out and other people are rating it, I feel pretty comfortable rating my own game.

I've given it a 9. I like it a lot. After having played it as much as I have, I doubt it'll hit the table often much in my house. However, for the level of tension, the amount of options you have during play and the simple nastiness of it.... I think it's a fabulous game. I'm really proud of it.

That being said, it is long. The scores fluctuate a lot. It can be random. If these aren't things you're okay with in a game, it might not be to your liking. But in spite of these negatives, I'm sticking with my rating for the simple fact that I still get a rush out of playing  it, and likely always will. Maybe that's my bias showing, maybe it's just the kind of game I like. :)

Hmm has a strong get stronger element which can always be a bit dangerous in a multiplayer wargame. (its more cost effective to attack the weak player, but then the leader continues to leave everyone in the dust)

The answer in most games that work is to add alliance situations that allow great advantage in cooperating (say for example by not having to defend a border with an ally) but terrain really doesn't have much rigor being fairly elastic with the nova flare ups making it easy to punch to a planet. (Update: there is an odd sort of alliance element in that allies can eat each others units to earn rewards -- but its not realistic and is a bit odd)

So overall the game has fun mechanics and novel ideas, but could do better at the dynamic that imho makes these types of games shine.

RATING: 6.5
Far too long for my preference, there are actually quite a bit to like in Supernova.  The battle card driven combat system is a welcomed change over the all too common die rolling; the researches are a nice implementation (even if they may be a bit too cheap for the benefits one can reap from them); I thought the tile laying for territorial expansion as well as the stack as a measure of strength is a neat touch; the desperation card is also a good catch-up mechanism for those without a planet to control, I actually went through the majority of the game with that and came in one point behind the leader.

However, there are also a few things that didn't really work either.  The different colony's power doesn't seem very balanced to start with, and if someone manages to snatch up two complementary abilities, it is very hard to take that person down without a concerted effort by all players.  Which pretty much means that the game suffers from bash the leader problem.  The supernova coin, while nicely produced, doesn't seem quite fair because we've only managed to flip one solar flare.  There weren't enough control tiles to last us the entire 12 rounds either.  Lastly, the special power cards and the exploration aspect felt rather poorly conceived and shallow, they seem more like an afterthought to me.

Even so, I imagine Supernova will appeal to those that enjoy the space colonization games with conflict.  I also found it to be a lot better than Galactic Emperor that also came out in 2008.  Decent, but probably not one I'd play very often.

So, so game. While it's fun in the beginning it can drag on and on later. For my taste there's way too much downtime between turns. Another big minus is that most of the time you only have 2 neighbors to wage war on (you have direct contact only to 2 players) even when you are playing with 5..

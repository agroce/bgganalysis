[i]tl;dr - Interesting ideas for a campaign-based game, but total lack of support and expansions leaves it dead in the water.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Warhammer Quest is a conflicting game for me. I really, truly did want to like it -- even though I'm not much for the RPG scene. This game could be described as a really lightweight RPG -- you will have one character throughout the five scenarios, and you'll be pimping out his actions and giving him better actions as you move along. As you go through, you'll be facing more difficult monsters and bosses and progressing through the five scenarios the game provides. 

Here are the two problems: 
1) The game is so short! I love the concept, but there's just not enough in the box. I have four basic actions, which can be upgraded to four advanced actions over time. Naturally, I'll upgrade my weakest action first and then go from there. Each successful round completed, you get to upgrade one action and add an item slot, so there aren't even difficult decisions to prioritize. They could have made the upgrading a game in itself (by providing 3 or 4 levels of actions to upgrade, leading characters to specialize much more), but they didn't.

A similar criticism for the scenarios. Wait, 5 scenarios and we're done with the box? Sure, you can go through again with different heroes (there are 4 total, so some replayability), but Odious Grump will always be your first boss and you will always use the same tactics to get through the scenarios. There's NO variability after you get through the initial quests.

2) The game isn't hard. At no point did I feel challenged or even surprised that we had won a scenario. Most seemed to be over too quickly and we just did similar things repetitively to end it. I'd really like to see a harder difficulty, or at least variability (three different versions of each boss, for example) so we would never really know which one would come out or which challenges we'd face. 

[b]In short, this is a great idea with very flawed execution.[/b] I could see it thriving if Games Workshop put out more expansions to it (more heroes, but especially more scenarios!) but there's no indication of that happening, especially with the recent GW/FFG split.

I've played the first scenario five times and the second scenario once, all losses.  I like the fact that the game supports solo play and there are real choices to be made during gameplay (and I guess I'm making a lot of wrong ones).  I'm reaching the point where I'm past the initial newness of the game and the losses are making it a lot less fun to get out and try.  Ah well, I'm sure I'll play the game again I just don't know when.

I shouldn't like this game as much as I do.  A little bit of that is nostalgia for my youth but it is more than that.  The difficulty is a big part of it and the way it feels different every time you play is probably the other big driver.  Extremely sad there will be no more content for this game. :(

A well designed game with a lot of interesting choices. The game is challenging. There is a lot of variety in monsters, locations, items, etc. to keep the game interesting. The art direction is fantastic. The rules are comprised of two books and require a lot of tedious and time consuming flipping back and forth. A must for Warhammer Fantasy fans.

I've only played the tutorial so far. It seemed fine. The main selling point would be that it's straightforward to teach. You get something like The Lord of the Rings Card Game without having to worry about everyone's eyes glazing over when you start to go through the rules.

But in return for that, the game play looks like it won't be super interesting and, more importantly, there really doesn't seem to be any meaningful story to it at all. This is really just an excuse to chuck dice and kill monsters for an hour.

Maybe there would have been an expansion that added a better story-telling mechanism (right now, they have to cram everything into a single half-sized page of paper and the locations are mostly shared). But that can no longer happen due to the breakup between Fantasy Flight and Games Workshop.

This game suffers from the subtitle. This game would have benefitted from a board to provide organization. This game would have benefitted with dials or scales or progress tracks or.....

RATING: 7
Συνεργατικό Fantasy card game στο κόσμο του warhammer με τον κάθε παίκτη να ελέγχει έναν ήρωα με διαφορετικές ικανότητες. Το παιχνίδι περιλαμβάνει μια campaign με 5 σενάρια όπου στο τέλος κάθε σεναρίου οι ήρωες μπορούν να βελτιώσουν τις ικανότητες τους ή/και να εξοπλιστούν. Παράλληλα το παιχνίδι περιλαμβάνει και ένα έχτρα αυτοτελές σενάριο κατά την διάρκεια του οποίου οι ήρωες πάλι βελτιώνονται όπως στο campaign. 
Το παιχνίδι είναι σχετικά απλό στην εκμάθηση αφού τα διαθέσιμα actions είναι 4.Τα actions αυτά είναι σε μορφή κάρτας, άρα ο κάθε παίκτης έχει μπροστά του 4 κάρτες και όταν χρησιμοποιεί μια από αυτές την γυρνάει ώστε να μην μπορεί να την ξαναχρησιμοποιήσει. Έχουμε λοιπόν attack, explore, aid και rest. Ακούγεται απλό.

Υπάρχει αρκετή τύχη στο παιχνίδι αφού σε κάθε action ρίχνεις τα ζάρια για να δεις πόσα τσεκούρια θα φέρεις. Προφανώς στο attack τα τσεκούρια δείχνουν πόση ζημιά θα κάνεις, στο rest πόσο heal θα κάνεις, στο explore πόσο θα εξερευνήσεις την τρέχουσα τοποθεσία και στο aid πόσα τσεκούρια θα δώσεις δώρο σε συμπαίκτη για μετέπειτα δικό του action.

Παράλληλα όσο εσύ κάνεις actions αν υπάρχει εχθρός μπροστά σου, ρίχνει και αυτός το ζάρι του μήπως και σε χτυπήσει. Συνεπώς δεν μπορείς να αγνοείς για πολύ τους εχθρούς κάνοντας explore και aid γιατί μαζεύονται μπροστά σου και σε χτυπούν ανελέητα. :arrrh: Μου άρεσε που οι εχθροί γενικά είναι απλοί στην χρήση τους και γράφουν πάνω στη κάρτα τους τι κάνει το κάθε τους ability. 

Συνολικά το παιχνίδι έχει μια αίσθηση από Lord of The Rings LCG κυρίως γιατί βγαίνουν τα τέρατα από την τράπουλα και μοιράζονται στους παίκτες αλλά και σε μια κεντρική περιοχή.  Οι ήρωες είναι διαφορετικοί μεταξύ τους όχι μόνο στο πόσα ζάρια ρίχνουν σε κάθε action αλλά και στο τι έξτρα πραγματάκια μπορούν να κάνουν μαζί με το κύριο action τους.

Αρκετά διασκεδαστικό και με ωραίους μηχανισμούς απλά φαίνεται ότι θέλει παραπάνω σενάρια, παραπάνω τέρατα, ήρωες, κτλ γενικά δώστε πράμα στο λαό. Δεν έχει replayability, χτυπάει κάπως άσχημα για παιχνίδι της κατηγορίας αυτής και το κάνει να δείχνει ημιτελές. :(

Mechanically, this game is the love-child of Space Marine Death Watch and Lord of the Rings LCG.  Smooth game play, dripping with theme, and with just enough luck to keep the excitement up.  And as many have said, it is a demanding game,and the heroes MUST work well together to score a win.  

Still, after a few plays, it's starting to seem somewhat mechanistic, so I'm less sure of its long-term appeal.

RATING: 8.4
Cool dungeon crawl card game for 1-4 players, attempts to recapture the glory of Warhammer Quest in a smaller format, and does succeed to an extent. Mechanics here are not all that new for Fantasy Flight, with clear nods to the Lord of the Rings LCG and Death Angel, but with the proper expansions, giving us more quests, enemies and characters, I can see this standing alongside Warhammer: Invasion and Chaos in the Old World as one of my main ways to interface with this fictional universe (since I don't play the minis and rarely get to play WFRP these days).

A pity about the split between FFG & GE, this co-op game had an opportunity to be highly expandable. Regardless, this is a card-driven "dungeon crawl" that sends a party of 2-4 heroes out to fight evil creatures in the Warhammer Fantasy setting. Interesting action selection and exploration mechanics makes this an interesting game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good alternative to Pathfinder: ACG. Warhammer is much tighter with more interaction due to the scope of actions. I don't see a huge amount of re-playability once you've completed the main campaign once or twice - the delve concept is cool, but the enemies are somewhat limited. Still, an excellent game - I'll be the first in line for the expansions.

Warhammer : The Adventure Card Game is a need little game with a high difficulty level.

It is quite... relentless in some aspect, which is not a problem by it self, but where I feel it falls a bit short is general strategy. The Luck portion of the game is fairly high, almost too high for such a game. If you will always play this game with a group of 3-4 people, this will be mitigated a bit as you are able to help each other.... did I say able ? You will have to help each other!

It's a great story, need game mechanics, it is relentless and works well with 3-4 players (best at 4).

This game surely seems a reimplementation of Lord of the Rings - The Card Game, without the LCG aspect (no deckbuilding and no regular expansions) and with an easier access for casual gamers.
The good news are in the relatively easy setting up (unless in LoTR you have already built decks) and the easier gameplay and learning curve: each hero has four actions and every turn the choice will be which one to use.
The randomness element, not coming from player's decks, is provided by dice rolling (but it seems manageable).
The bad news lie in replayability: there are just 4 heroes, and not so many scenarios... The need for expansions is already in the air...

RATING: 7
Well done core set. It's too bad that they didn't issue additional quest lines for the game. It's a fun card-based dungeon crawl that feels like a mashup of Shadowrun: Crossfire and Space Hulk: Death Angel. I've heard it also described as a streamlined Lord of the Rings LCG, which I have not played. 

This game replaced Space Hulk: Death Angel for me. The leveling and gearing up of your characters is quite fun. Each quest feels tightly balanced and the dice do not appear to make or break a particular session. Also, exploding dice. The campaign and delve quest provide good replayability. 

As some negatives, the box does feel like a core set, which is an artifact of the failure to develop this product line. Some of the character classes also do not work well in particular combinations at low player counts (e.g., 1 or 2 players).

Very enjoyable and worth the $25 price tag. I'll get a lot of plays out of this.

Once I clarified the attack, engage, attack rules in the forums (not that clear based on the number of people asking the same questions) this is really a well designed game, all the mechanics make sense as it emulates a typical dungeon crawl rpg or board game.

Compared to the Lotr Living Card Game (8.8) it is not as good andhas far less content 
But the monsters and enemies are much more diverse than in say Gears of War (rated 7.4)

The Art is beautiful. And once you get used to your heroes you start loving them just like in a real On line Adventure game.

The basic manual is not that great and a bit confusing without searching for internet help.

Most common mistakes are the black die results of ONE claw which means 1,2 or 3 hits on your hero (blocked or not) and depending on the monster.

The manual lacks a clear "Sequence of play" with all steps involved in a case by case number.

The Reference guide though is great and clearly a new initiative since these reference guides were introduced in FFG's Eldritch Horror.

The rating might go up in the future (I hope so),.... 
--------UPDATED ------ !!!

Downrated this due to the NON fun play of the last 2 scenarios in a 5 round campaign for solo play with 2 avatars ...

Desperately needs the DELVE quest to be changed with a firmer "timer" so gamey/unfun tactics are not used.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
This is what I wanted from the LOTR LCG.  I wanted the card play mechanisms, minus the deck building, and this is exactly what is here.  I also like that the game is no cake walk, with every adventure being a nail bitter till the end.  I can't complain about the amount of content yet since the game just came out, but for a game like this to survive, we are going to need a ton of content, and I am not sure how much support this will get compared to an LCG.  If this get support, I think this could be a fantastic game, however if it doesn't get support, it will just end up being a fun, yet forgotten game in a few years.

Traded away my copy after playing some of the campaign. The game can be fun but it wasn't exciting enough to keep us interested. The campaign carry over felt minor and didn't really give us the feeling of growing more powerful. Coupled with the fact that there will be no further support for the game I decided to move it along. Not a bad game by any means, but not enough there to hold my interest for more than 5 plays or so.

RATING: 5
After a single play, I doubt I will try this one again.  We played the start mission of the campaign with the Dwarf and the Ranger.  We cleared the first location relatively easily and then hit a location that spawned 5 enemies, and the nemesis came out to play too.  We didn't have a chance.
  
This was unsatisfying because I didn't feel like there was much we could do to change the course of the game.  I had a hard time seeing how we could use different choices to adapt to the situation.  For example, the dwarf was our tank.  With lots of monsters out, we want to prioritize dealing damage.  The best way to do that is for each character to Aid the others' attack.  The Ranger refreshes on the Attack option and the Dwarf refreshes on Aid, and the Ranger's Aid refreshes one action for the Aided character, so you can get as many as 3 attacks per round.  But the black dice for engaged enemies meant that they were dealing more damage on our attacks than we did, and our rolling was merely average, so we had trouble killing even one enemy per attack.  5 enemies plus the nemesis (who easily counts as 2 normal enemies) was simply insurmountable. 

A co-op needs to provide challenge to be worth playing.  But it also needs to provide tools for the players to overcome the challenge.  This felt like a challenge with no tools - flip the card, deal the enemies, and roll until you win or die.  I felt that the cards and die rolls had far more influence on the outcome than my choices did.  Which essentially makes it Candyland in Warhammer clothing.

Another winner from Fantasy Flight Games.  This is roleplaying for board gamers.  Components are great, the game concept is excellent.  I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 because I had trouble interpreting the rulebook and not enough game play examples where provided for me.  Thanks to everyone here I was able to dig through the forums and find the answers I need.  This is a no brainer purchase for fans of co-op, dungeon crawl, or solitaire games.

EDIT:  After numerous plays this game is just awesome.  I have put it to 10.  The rules can be a confusing but the game is worth figuring out.  Amazing game.

A game reminiscent of Konieczka's Death Angel but with a campaign twist and a pseudo-advancement mechanic that makes it so much better! 
Had a lot of fun playing it with good friends! 
I think it's gonna feel repetitive after a while, but it is very expandable and I bet my house that new quests, heroes, enemies, gear and what have you are already on the way! 
I won't go nuts about it but I think I'll never say no to a game!

Since Pathfinder is just a dull collection of low quality cardstock I was looking for another RPG-like-cardgame.

I like the gameplay where you have your different actions and you have to figure out what might be the best option for your turn.
Currently it seems a lot easier than LotR LCG, hopefully this will change later in the campaign.
Or with upcoming content, which this game absolutely needs to shine.

Very fun little card game.  FFG did a good job of distilling a dungeon crawl down to it's essence: kill things, grab their loot, and move on.  Best with four players - in fact, it is best to play with all 4 characters no matter how many players you have. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Great dungeon crawl style adventure game. Difficulty is tuned perfectly with four heroes: tough as nails but failures are rare once you get the hang of it. With only one short campaign (5 quests) and one longer delve quest that reuses the bosses from the campaign, it has limited replayability.

This is an interesting card based dungeon crawler that's somewhat evocative of its miniature dungeon crawl equivalent.  The action card management is interesting and there is a nice deal of content for the price.  However, this game does seem very reliant on content discovery as a primary means for play (like every other dungeon crawler) and you can burn through this content relatively quickly.  

Dungeon crawlers need to feel alive and mysterious and this one can lose that feeling once you've seen the same item/location/enemy repeatedly.  

It also doesn't feel as daring or original as Space Hulk: Death Angel, a comparable design.  That fell out of nowhere and was completely shocking for how strong it is.  WHQACG on the other hand feels like an evolution of that design as well as the LOTR LCG.  Not as shocking or surprising in 2015.

Death Angel also avoids the content discovery crutch because it's not exactly a dungeon crawler.  It's more about running a gauntlet and trying to cling on to the roller coaster for dear life.  It's more about the challenging experience.  This game is challenging so it has some of that, but that's not what really makes WHQACG interesting and not the main element I want from it.

This is a decent game and is interesting, but I think it fails to really achieve its potential.

There is a mature underlying mechanical system here - as there should be, given its pedigree. Does a good job of capturing the feel of exploring a dungeon, whilst remaining fairly abstract in its overall build. The role of exploring rooms, and means of refreshing character abilities is interestingly implemented. A good use of the grim-dark setting in making each character an interesting option with very different gameplay styles. I only wish there were a few more cards of all kinds, in order to greater facilitate one-off adventures with a little more variety - but I am sure these will come in inevitable expansions. I was bought a copy of the original game when it first released, which both got me into the fantasy gaming hobby and led to many happy memories of playing it - I hope this title lives up to the lofty expectations created by such a strong personal history. 

But... after trying the tutorial, I'm not entirely sure whether I liked it or not! So much swinging in terms of wounds and healing, makes it seem a little... unusual. I think a system that slowly reduced maximum health as assigned damage thresholds were hit implemented, only healed between adventures (or even then, not always fully). Also: additional alt. options for character training, representing a different (riskier) path for each of the four actions, so allow for a degree of customisation.

Excellent game for those that enjoy a dungeon crawl with less setup. Still a complex and challenging game with a mixture of skill and luck. Didn't give a 10 as I find that the solo (2 hero) game is somewhat unbalanced (bright wizard) and very difficult, although this is a problem with a lot of other games as well. Better than LOTR if you like to save time and not spend 20 hours before playing the game sorting out a deck, plus you are mostly in the game during a quest even if u get a couple of bad rolls

Rather slim approach to the whole "adventure game" trope. Each character "consists" of only four actions and a handful of gear that has to be aquired while on a quest. Mechanics take center-stage and the storytelling aspect is somewhat muted, but the workings make for a solid and interesting puzzle, forcing players to plan their turn and not just mindlessly spend their actions. Artwork and production are good. While not a game that completely "wows" players, Warhammer Quest offers engaging and rewarding gameplay.

This game is so fun! The rules can be a bit difficult to understand at first, but basically you have 4 actions. On your turn, tap an action card to take that action. You can't tap an already tapped card, so you will want to do different actions from turn to turn. One of your actions also "refreshes" tapped action cards, but is generally weaker than your other actions to compensate.

Attacks aren't deterministic but rely on dice. The dice will hate you! Like I said, you want to spread out your action types (so you generally won't be using your strongest attacks turn after turn) but the timing matters a lot. That's because you'll want to juggle between dealing with monsters (because they hurt you) and advancing the plot (which you have to do to win the game). 

A cool feature is that monsters have "AI" written on their cards so you can predict who the monster will attack and for how much damage. It is really important that this is discussed as a group so that the timing of actions between group members is coordinated. You don't want to be in a situation where you desperately need your healer to heal but oh no! Their heal was tapped and they didn't have a chance to refresh! And now you're dead. This is a hard game.

The "campaign" is pretty cool because you can upgrade your action cards for better actions. But the monsters also get harder...Like I said, this is a hard game.

RATING: 6
Pros:
- Strong teamwork element with players choosing character specific action cards that must wait a turn to refresh. Players have to manage enemies, attacking, resting or preparing for later rounds.

- Each character is unique in terms of what they specialize at and provides a different play experience.

- Challenging game when having to manage everyone's life points and timer of scenario. Dice combat is not overly swingy but still random enough to be dramatic and fun.

- Great artwork and component quality. You miss the idea of a board and miniatures but the card game version idea works well here.

Cons:
- Biggest issue is limited replayability despite having the generic dungeon crawling mode. After playing through a single campaign you've seen everything the game has to offer as all enemies and bosses have been present at some point. No expansions currently due to license issue. Maybe in the future they will reprint and expand it?

- Loot is random and in a campaign some characters can randomly get way more powerful than others due to how loot drops and who potentially gets their character specific items, but it is a cooperative game anyway.

- Full information opens door to alpha player play.

A fantastic idea for the previous WFRP gamers, who are 'too old' to gather again for a session involving actual 'role play'. Instead you get a still good Old World theme for dungeon crawling and 'action' side of Warhammer world. 

There is one big con - FFG and GW stopped and killed new-born and IMO evolving game. This is unbeliveble loss for fan like me. But hey! There is a growing community and available expansions and add-ons. Still a core game can give you a joy both in solo (!) and co-op team.

The rulebook is a bit of a mess with moments where I was left puzzling and scratching my head. It is a very fun and challenging game that has a lot of spiritual connection to Space Hulk: Death Angel where the nature of the game is captured, the skirmishing and re-positioning of enemies that are common in a dungeon crawl without the sprawling map and miniatures. The knock against it is that the rules aren't intuitive, just like SHDA, and at times cumbersome and on occasion leaves me craving the streamlined, intuitive rules, of Warhammer Quest or Space Hulk. But in all fairness the reverse happens as well where I'll be playing one of those craving the more gamey version. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Gets a surprising amount of characterisation out of four action cards, the elf moves and shoots fast, the dwarf soldiers on, the wizard is volatile. Equally the game makes the most of its different enemies and locations forcing you to think through effective strategy. I like this at present, it gets a lot out of a relatively simple structure and rule set. Generally i find dungeon crawlers rather dull, but this game hits the spot thus far.

RATING: 7
Warhammer Quest ACG is a cooperative experience that shares many mechanical similarities to Lord of the Rings LCG. I say this because players will be using their characters to explore locations, attack, and aid allies while progressing through a quest through very similar mechanisms. I prefer Warhammer Quest because: 

-It doesn't have near financial upkeep to own everything. Though, that means there is less content.

-There is no deck creation outside of game time. This could be a negative to some, whereas I'm more of a pickup-go sort of player that doesn't like to do deck creation anymore.

-The various quests in WHQACG can be played in a campaign where you upgrade your characters between quests. LOTRLCG has strings of quests (thematically linked) that players can play in sequence. That said, you don't really upgrade your deck/character. You simply may make some changes to your deck. It feels less like upgrading because you didn't do anything in the game to earn these new changes. I only played the Core Set of LOTRLCG, so further expansions (of which there are many) could have changed this.

-I feel like every quest in WHQACG is beatable by the characters you're provided. In LOTRLCG, I've felt that my deck will eventually hit a quest in the string of thematically linked quests that focuses heavily on exploring or combat and if I don't have a deck specifically made to deal with these challenges, I don't have any chances at winning. Yes, I could alter my deck and beat that challenge, but then when I continue on to the next quest I may find the deck has deficiencies that are hampering my ability to win. So, in LOTRLCG, I feel like you will lose more often because of the kind quest you come across rather than a player's skill. Where's the fun in beating a quest when you have made your deck specifically to do just such a thing?

WHQACG also has a somewhat similar feel to Sentinels of the Multiverse. There is less diversity in WHQACG, but there is a lot less fiddliness and calulation/re-calculation, which suits me just fine. WHQACG is also compared to Pathfinder ACG. I haven't played PACG, but I do know there is less persistence/upgrading of your character in WHQACG. That said, PACG is more expensive when you consider each quest in the string is a separate cost and there are additional addons that can be purchased.

WHQACG is not a perfect game. It contains player elimination. I said I would never own a game which contains this. It's not the biggest deal in the world because I tend to play this 2-player with 2 characters each and if one person has both of their characters die, we count it as the entire party dying. It could be a problem for other people in a 4-player game if someone unluckily dies early. In addition, like LOTRLCG, I feel this game doesn't scale very well. I find the challenge is reduced the more characters you add, but the issue is ultimately more amplified in LOTRLCG. Don't worry, it's still a tough game. While there is decent variety in WHQACG, I did not keep it due to the GW FFG split, meaning no new content for the system, other than user-created content.

Played twice. A good dungeon-delve themed card game. I like the Warhammer universe, so I guess I'm predisposed to liking this, but the game does a good job of providing that delving feel in a slightly abstract card game. Brace for expansions! There's hours of fun in this box, but you'll probably need an expansion at some point to keep it fresh.

A fun game. Enjoyable mechanics and puzzle. The campaign elements are pretty thin; an extra die here, a marginally useful item there. The scenarios and location cards provide for some interesting variety. There is sort of a generic sameness that permeates the experience in an unsatisfying way, and I'm hard-pressed to pinpoint exactly why. That and the rules are the most annoying thing to parse. Bad rulebook took 4 games just to get it right.

Nagyon jó kis kártyás dungeon crawler. Most talán jobbnak mondanám, mint a Pathfinder, mert kevesebb kártyából, elegánsabban hoz ki, akár nagyobb változatosságot is. A karakterek elég mások, az összedolgozásra is figyelni kell, és pont annyi random/fix van a küldetésekben, hogy változatos legyen, de ne is vesszen el az eredeti sztori.

The rating based on two player games. The first two scenarios were a little bit on the easy side, the third one was very good. The biggest negative about the game was the lack of depth - there are very few moments where you really need to think, the decisions are fairly easy. But the game is fun nonetheless. Re playability is low, because the bright wizard is very underpowered and unplayable. With more campaigns and at least 4 more characters (as I saw on the nets, there are about 10 more in the original Warhamnmer Quest) the re-playability would go up significantly.

Theme and feel of the grail game Warhammer Quest distilled in to a, believe it or not, excellent card adventure game.

Still a lot of replay value here as the synergy between player powers is quite excellent.

Beautiful! I thought that the dice could ruin the game with too much randomness. instead they create only a little and nice mess.
The game is fast, but requires you to think about your next move. it may seems not so hard, but you get to the end with really few life points.
brilliant campaign preparation.

This really seems like it should be the perfect solo game. But I just have no desire to keep playing it, after half-a-dozen tries. I'm not sure exactly why. Certainly, it's too hard, with just one win in those tries. But it's also the feel of playing, the feeling that it's just slamming you at every turn again and again, that is unenjoyable. Just not a fun experience.

Positives: The mechanics are easy to learn and make the game play smooth. The rules are intuitive and easy to learn after the tutorial. The quality of the game is good. My favorite solo and co-op game. I do enjoy the story of the campaign. Also, the gear/dungeon cards, plus the ability to upgrade my character's abilities after every phase of the campaign. 

Negatives: not a lot of content. By this i mean there is only 1 campaign and one mini-campaign. There are no expansions. Also not a diverse set of enemies. I just see the same ones. Again, an expansion would solve this problem.

Overall, a great game to have on your shelf if you ever feeling the need to play a game but have no one to play with. An above average co-op game, but would be drastically improved with an expansion.

It is also HIGHLY OVERRATED by the BGG community.

EDIT: DO NOT BUY. This is only a shadow of what Warhammer quest was, and only a fifth of what this game should have been. ON TOP OF THAT IT IS AN EMPTY BOX FOR 40-50$!!! A pure FF game, and I am not telling you what those two "F" means. hehe!

Before this came out, I had a prototype that was warhammer quest in card game with a system of monsters that is similar to Arkham Horror (the monster cup thing), why did they not use that? Fantasy Flight have a knack at doing crappy games and ruining 50% of the time classic games like Merchant of Venus and Warhammer Quest for examples.

Hey! Look, there are some elite monsters... yay! I feel like I am in a MMO Hack'n'slasher! You suck FF as much as these morons that created that video game about WQ, you both ruined a great game. Why don't you guys at FF reprint the old version of the game with monsters like in Arkham Horror (small tiles) where you can print you famous but useless eyecandy on them with their stats on the back? You really need some intelligent and creative game designers in your gang, you really suck.

Yuck! This sucks! Where is my real Warhammer Quest? Why is it that everyone is ruining this nice game with "spinoffs" that are not even close to the original game (fun and depth)?

There was that crappy video game that had nothing to do with the Warhammer World (felt like a dumdum DnD gameworld) and now this!

Come on! Reprint THE REAL WARHAMMER QUEST PLEASE!

Will boycott that one like if I was on a crusade! Don't buy! 

If you do not know Warhammer Quest like me, then this game is EXTREMELY LIMITED. For 40-50$ you will have less than 8 hours of gameplay, an almost empty box, and characters that do not progress beyond "level 4". Meaning that after two adventures, your character will be maxed out. Boring right? In the old warhammer quest, your charater could do dozens of adventures before he gets to maximum level (level 10 and no stupid cards for character building), it was great. I really hate it when people destroy excellent games like that with cheap remakes. Just republish the damn original damn it! Even if it's with cardbord minis or tiles for monsters, I don't care!

Like all Fantasy Flight Junk, it's just eyecandy and very little content and no great game mechanics.

I'm getting rid of this junk.

Have only played tutorial and 2 campaign stories.

Pros: Warhammer adventure without mini or RPG, for the player short of time and friends.
Love the enemy mechanic where they hit you every time you attempt an action. Make you think through your actions a bit more carefully.

Cons: Similarly to Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (which I have played extensively), the game is language heavy and prone to a lot of card interactions that may be confusing. Although unlike PACG, reading the WQACG rulebook is more likely to give you an answer. 

A smash hit so far, no wonder FFG is out of stock.

Deckbuilder licencia warhammer fantasy, con personajes arquetipicos (enano tanke, hechicera tirabolasdefuego, guerrero paladin y arquera elfica)

el "motor de juego" viene a ser basicamente, el de ESDLA LCG ("viajar", enfrentarse a enemigos que se alinean a los jugadores...), como aquel, es cooperativo, aunque este ya viene ajustado de serie para jugar hasta 4 jugadores. el sistema ha sido tuneado con un esquema de acciones trincado del space hulk death angel (tienes 4 acciones basicas: atacar, explorar, apoyar y descansar, que agotas y una de las 4 no se agota y permite reponer a las demas), aderezado con tiradas con dados y bueno... lo tipico de todo deckbuilder: montar combos con las cartas para optimizar resultados y ganar la partida. 

el juego es dificilillo, aunque sin llegar a frustrante (al menos en principio). el esquema de juego es sencillo y agradable de jugar, pero el manual en algunos puntos no es del todo claro. y eso que es manual doble "estilo eldritch" (guia de juego y guia de referencia). en la primera partida cometimos varios errores por no encontrar en ninguno de los manuales resolver cosas basicas del tipo de "y si se agota el mazo de enemigos que se hace?" o_O

ilustraciones bien. calidades suficientes (cartas, 6 dados y algunos tokens). tematica poco original pero bien desarrollada. mola que es un juego "pequeño" (caja tamaño simbolo arcano) y que no es un LCG, asi que no van a sacar para el 184 expansiones que hagan que el juego completo acabe costando como un coche pequeño. como contrapartida: probablemente sera poco rejugable una vez acabada la (unica) campaña que trae. y la mision introductoria es una pesima broma, es 1 LUGAR Y PUNTO. no dura ni 45 minutos y eso incluyendo que te expliquen comosejuega y el (minimo) despliegue. bueno, es que de hecho si 3 jugadores exploran se puede acabar la "partida" en una ronda. o_O

en fin... rants aparte... buen juego y apto para casi todo tipo de publico. de lo mejorcito para introducirse en el proceloso mundo de los deckbuilders. 

pd. propuesta de noche tematica: warhammer quest, dungeon quest, hero quest, arcadia quest y munchkin quest. XD

RATING: 7
After a few solo plays of the campaign game, I feel mostly inclined to say that this is an interesting evolution of Death Angel. The campaign elements are pretty thin; an extra die here, a marginally useful item there. The scenarios and location cards provide for some interesting variety, but then again the same could be said of Death Angel.
I am keen to try a delve quest with more players.
[EDIT] Yeah, I think Death Angel might be better. This is a little too long and the campaign elements really are rather thin. There's sort of a generic sameness that permeates the experience in an unsatisfying way, and I'm hard-pressed to pinpoint exactly why.

I was VERY surprised how much I enjoyed this game. The rule book is vague about a number of things. We had to refer to YouTube videos for reference. While I don't normally mind this, it can get frustrating when you're in the middle of the game and need a quick rule or procedure explanation but the rule book isn't clear. So someone has to leave the table, find a video, then find the part of the video that talks about the question you have. So one star off for lack of clarity in the rule book. Otherwise it's a fun coop card based dungeon adventure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good co-op.  Good amount of discussion among the players and the characters feel different.
Fairly simple rules,  but the "Learn to play" and "Reference book" combo is really badly structured. I've never flipped through the rulebook so much for such a simple rule-set.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
From a strict solo perspective: challenging, brutal dungeon crawler, oozes theme. It plays smoothly with smart and elegant mechanics throughout. The campaign aspect of the game is brilliant. After some 9 hours of play (in less then a week - NOT AT ALL usual for me) I just want to play it some more. The art and the quality of the components are stellar (hey, it's from FFG: what did you expect?)
Setup time is around 7-8 minutes which is cool. On the other hand playtime -at least solo- is longer then "advertised", clocking in from 75 to 120 minutes per quest AFTER having well grasped the rules.  
I just played it solo for now, but the game is built around adventurers helping one another and it's easy to see it "should" be one fine cooperative game. I'll edit as soon as I try it multiplayer (I hope soon).

If you play solo, OR you like Warhammer lore OR you like dungeon crawler games: make yourself a favour and try this game.
I love it.

RATING: 7.85
A surprisingly rather hard game, where dice roll maybe a little too much, story is a bit short, but Warhammer feel is here as well as a sense of exploration,fighting well-known monsters with a simple AI, and all. Cooperation matters if the heroes are to make it through to the next Location. Feels a bit like a mini-Assault on Doomrock.
I'm not sure going through the campaign will make levelling up that interesting, even if upgraded cards are significantly more efficient.
The game is rather short to play, which is a definite plus nowadays.

Sounded good on paper, but ended up being disappointing. Don't recommend for solo play.

Uneven difficulty based on how many characters you're playing with. This is not that unusual, but here, you need to play with 3 to have what I would consider a fair chance at winning. For a solo player, that's a lot of bookkeeping. 

The four action cards give you limited options in what you do and a lot of the game is dependent on chance. 

Forgettable theme that disappears when you play because of the samey locations and enemies, and the Warhammer setting is just silly. It's ironic that Games Workshop, the company behind something so uninspired and borderline plagiarized, is so controlling about its "intellectual property." 

It seems like they tried to streamline LotR LCG but went too far and lost too much of the depth and fun of the system.

A great game. For me, the best dungeon crawler and best solo/coop game I have ever played. The mechanics are simple and clever, providing a lot of meaningful choices with minimal book-keeping and creating the right theme and atmosphere. There are 5 campaign scenarios and 1 single-shot quest. Both the campaign and the single quest can be played multiple times, due to the semi-random setup of the scenarios giving new problems to tackle each time. It is also interesting to play with different hero count and combinations. The random element (dice rolls, card draws) is balanced very well, making the outcome of actions uncertain but controllable. I suggest this game to anyone who likes solo and coop games, and for those who want to try a new take on the dungeon crawler genre.

A great game that should had become excellent with more expansions and adventures sheets. It was discontinued way too early... Juego cooperativo que enfrenta a los jugadores con una serie de obstáculos tipo "escapar del calabozo". El "tablero" está compuesto por cartas y la puesta en función es muy ágil y atractiva. Las jugadores alternana acciones que no pueden usar de un turno a otro. Algunos monstruos están en la sombra y pueden atacar sorpresivamente. Muy divertido, aunque la curva de aprendizaje puede ser amplia.

Evolution of LotR LCG. Lots of pluses in this design -

No deckbuilding - base game is fully playable and a complete experience unlike LotR base game.

Nemesis boss hangs out off to the side affecting players via the nemesis die rolls. Eventually comes into play alongside monsters.

Plenty of tension - go after monsters, explore, or take on the boss. Exploring an area also sometimes does things like reset a cannon to fire which was a fun mechanic instead of just "travel to the next card."

Plenty of interaction between players in terms of assisting each other or tactical plays - everyone is involved at all times.

The game scales well because it allows for more health and more actions with less players to balance things.

Plenty of tactics with the monsters and solid AI. Can be a bit confusing but after a play or two it makes sense.

Loot system works well - go after loot card draws by exploring which may include legendary items later in the game, or try to stay on top of the monster hordes.

Blends in quest success or failure mechanic from Descent well.

Captures the essence of original WHQ but removes the stiff, sloggy, one dimensional play of the original. Also don't need a GM which is a plus.

5-part quest in the box is fun and has plenty of story arc and holds the players' interest. Remarkable for just a card game since it ratchets up the challenge and your character improves abilities and gear making it feel more epic.

Solo option.

Quibble - doesn't allow for much in the way of dungeon exploration. Would like something along the lines of space hulk where you have physical cards to go to and do things. I am hoping this happens in one of the expansions.

This is a tight, well refined game, taking the best parts of prior FF fantasy games and making a new, solid game that still holds nostalgia for WHQ fans. I really don't see any issues with the game other than the usual FF issue of many small rules that are tough to stay on top of and could use better clarifications in the rule book.

We played through the five quest campaign in two sessions and enjoyed it a lot and are already looking forward to expansions. Game has a lot of potential for expansions other than just "more cards, characters, loot, etc."

The game can be quite challenging but the theme and setting really tie into the gameplay and overall feel.

Seems to play better at 3 or 4 players. At 2 players the health increase isn't really enough to offset having to deal with multiple monsters at once whereas in higher player counts the monsters would be more spread out so you're more likely to be able to do the action you want that turn.

Fun game that's a combination of LoTR: The Card Game and Death Angel. However, it avoids the deck building of the former (a good thing in my book) and has much better gameplay than the later (which I'm not a massive fan of). It just needs more content; which I'm sure it will get...

Very elegant and well-designed mechanics. An excellent blend of styles from several different games (such as Lord of the Rings LCG and Space Hulk: Death Angel) yet manages to improve upon the drawbacks of such influencing games, and also creates some clever new additions of its own.

It seems to be best with 3 players though. Four players may be too easy, and 2 players (or solo) can be too difficult depending on the heroes you play. The Bright Wizard in particular seems underpowered if used in a 2-hero game.

My main concern at this point however is replayability. Even thought it comes with 6 quests and 4 heroes (for a total of up to 36 possible distinct set-ups depending on player count) I'm not sure this will be enough. Expansions are likely forthcoming, but you don't get too much for your money with this starter set.

Still, overall a great game and can't wait to grab more for it!

A clunky, fiddly reimplementation of LotR LCG and Death Angel mechanics. The rulebook is a chore (I actually like the separate rulebooks FF has been doing, but this one is pants) and doesn't taste like Warhammer at all - it is machine-extruded dollar-store-brand dark fantasy with dull, generic characters and uninspired mechanics.

Great art, though.

Wow, this game is hard to win! In two games we didn't even come close to a chance of winning. It's not just a lack of squeezing out the last efficiencies, a change in strategy seems necessary. Maybe, travelling faster, running away more from the foes instead of trying to defeat the majority.

Warhammer Quest: TACG is a good mix between relevant decisionmaking and thematic experience. What role to play, when to use special abilities and success tokens, who to target and how to cooperate. Bad luck with the dice and the card draws can thwart the best plans but it will still be entertaining. The biggest threat to entertainment might be a limited replayability. 

The campaign is interesting although it certainly would be more interesting when at least one of the games is won to improve the deck for future quests.

Time: 30-60 minutes
Players work together to beat a series of quests that form a short narrative campaign. Minor character advancement occurs between quests. Monsters feel unique from one another and the action is driven by action selection management. this doesn't feel like the original game, but is certainly enjoyable in it's own way!

A szabályok elmondása után kicsit LOTR card game érzetem volt (ami amúgy jó jel), de azért összességében eléggé más a játék, csak néhány főbb elemben egyeznek. összességében tetszik az egész a hangulat, a tematikusság miatt, csak kicsit túl soknak érzem a kockadobást. Gyakorlatilag mindenhez szükség van rá, és bizony lehet elég rosszul járni. Az egymásra hatás, egymás segítése nagyon jó, nélkülözhetetlen, tényleg kooperatív érzete van, oda kell figyelni a társakra. Elsőre minden bizonnyal nem láttam át annyira az egészet, amennyire kellett volna, de szívesen játszom még vele, úgy érzem, van benne potenciál.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I expect my Monday night group will work through this as a campaign. A lot of people seem to love this one but I wasn't overly impressed. The character development feels slow and offputting. The process of questing is interesting in how the card actions work and are unavailable after use in many cases until the weakest action is chosen to refresh a character's actions.

Pretty nice little dice-chucking game. I love the art. I just can't resist the fantasy theme.  I like that the dice don't have a FAIL side like they do in Descent. If you roll a few of those in a row, it's so easy for the game to South. But in Warhammer, you know you're at least going to get a shield, which is good for something, not just flailing about hitting the air.
I like the explore and other mechanics that are used to give the game something of an adventure feel.
I am finding, that even though I very much want to like this type of game, Eurogames still draw me in more with their complex decision making trees.

RATING: 7
Did this game replace LOTR LCG for me? Well for the most part. I think I like the exploration action for LOTR more, and how it integrates with the staging area, in that you have the choice to engage with monsters sometimes, and not doing so makes exploring more difficult. Both have a very interesting dynamic of balancing exploring with attacking, but here, it's more just dice rolls for exploration and monsters attack you no matter what. I also like how what actions you can do changes in LOTR based on what different cards are in your hand. However, that's where the things I like more of lOTR LCG ends.

First of all, no deck building required for Warhammer Quest. While this would probably be a negative if I was super invested in LOTR LCG, the number of highly situational cards in the base set and the need to specific cards at times to counter each scenario of LOTR LCG makes this a plus for WQ. Secondly, the monsters don't seem to require as much metagaming or swinginess, e.g. the LOTR condition card that effectively puts one of your hero out of commission half the time, which is devastating early game unless you have some way to cure conditions. The monsters do act differently from each other in WQ, but not knowing a specific card is not going to be a deal breaker. Which brings us to the third pro: unique monster AI for each monster. Fourth: It feels like a more complete game prior to buying expansions. Fifth: I liked the need to time your actions so that your cards refresh when you need them to. Sixth: I was afraid the aid action would feel like what you do when you can't do anything else with your actions, but based on turn order, what monsters are engaged with who, etc. aiding other people can be quite profitable. Seventh: I like how fully exploring a location is a bigger deal in this game, as it wipes all shadow monsters, but you don't want to do it too soon or you'll get overwhelmed with monsters.

This game definitely requires you to work together. Between deciding which monsters engages with who, ranged attackers choosing who to attack, coordinating who is attacking vs. exploring, etc. This is accentuated by each hero having fairly different play styles.

I love the brutality of this game, which it manages to do without the LOTR metagaming. Unless a game is smacking you in the face, there isn't as strong drive to defeat it. 

This game will have to prove to me the scenarios have much distinguishing themselves from each other before I bump it up to an 8.

I was afraid a 3 player game would be bad due to the assymetric distribution of turns, but I actually kind of liked the needed added coordination of figuring out who had to do what based on who got the double action, and turn order.

I absolutely hate the format of the rulebook. Basically it gives you a feel of the game, and then all the details is written in the format of a glossary, that self references itself like crazy, causing you have to flip everywhere to find anything. The worst is one when it said see this keyword, and when we flipped to it the only thing it said was see another keyword.

EDIT: Hmm a solo campaigned the scenarios and just played a 4 player game recently and won all of them, so much for being brutal. The scenarios all have the general idea of rush exploring while not getting over with monsters and beat a timer, but feel more different than they should be mechanically. The upgrades do make your characters feel pretty different, although you get a lot of them throughout a campaign so I don't think you'll feel different from campaign to campaign, and there's a bit of runaway winner/loser syndrome (similar problem as Descent)

RATING: 5
I like card games. I like that I don't have to paint figures, and I can setup and tear down a game relatively quickly. I also like to play solo sometimes. Oh, and I like a grand adventure game set in a fantasy environment with fantastic artwork. So why on earth don't I like Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game that much?

Let's start with what I do like. This game incorporates elements of several games that I also wanted to like, but never formed a lasting relationship; The Lord of the Rings Living Card Game, Pathfinder, the Adventure Card Game, and Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game. After playing all of these games I came away wishing for elements of each game to be incorporated into one truly awesome game. Maybe Warhammer Quest could be the "one game to rule them all". 

In Warhammer Quest you play as four different heroes, and you can play it as a four player game, or play solo controlling two to four heroes. The characters are standard fantasy fare, and include a wizard, elf, dwarf and a warrior priest. There isn't any deck building in this game. Unlike Lord of the Rings, you don't spend 30 minutes building a custom deck for your hero before the game even begins to then find out you added cards to your deck that you won't need. Each character has 4 unique action cards that let you do things like Attack, Explore, Aid and Rest. On your turn you activate a card, do what it says and then exhaust the card until you activate one specific action card that refreshes all four of the cards for your hero. I love it... it's simple but offers lots of fun strategic decision making. You really feel like a team of explorers, who can unleash hell on one turn, while offering support to their comrade on the next. 

And there's lots of hell to unleash upon. Endless waves of ghouls and goblins pour into your characters engagement zone, offering a typical Warhammer mixture of quirky humor and horror on each card. Attacks are accomplished with custom dice that produce "Success" symbols along with "Shield" symbols which block hits. Wounds are tracked using cardboard chits. The enemies can attack during each activation of one of your action cards, and also during their own Enemy Phase... yes, there will be blood, lots of it. 

Interspersed within all of this violence there is a mission. Each Quest has it's own setup rules and goals, and as the mission progresses, new enemies appear as indicated on the Quest card. Location cards offer variety within the scenario, and new locations can be visited once enough progress tokens are placed upon a location, so don't get too caught up in the bloodshed... you've got to be somewhere else... and fast! I think this is a brilliant game mechanic that has been much improved upon since I saw it in the Lord of the Rings Card Game.

Sounds like fun, right? What's not to like? Well, as I write this I realize that it really is a fun game;  I'm still playing it and thinking about playing it when I'm not playing it... so what's my problem?

Let's start with the setting. I'm not a Warhammer fan. Never have been. Just don't get it. If this was set in the Middle Earth or even Star Wars universe, I'd be shouting from the rooftops "Best game ever!", even with its flaws, but I just can't. The artwork is excellent, but I just don't connect emotionally with anything I'm seeing. The characters don't even have names! It feels like this game was made for Warhammer fans only, and if you don't know the universe you're out of luck. Also, I always find in games without maps or boards that I never connect with the locations. Showing me a card with a forest on it never allows me to smell the leaves, but put the forest on a map or game board surrounded by different terrain features, and ahhh'... smell the freshness! I can't explain it, but flipping through the drab sepia tone location cards for this game just doesn't make me feel like I'm going anywhere.

Next, let's talk about the rulebook. I've read debates online about how bad this rulebook is compared to other Fantasy Flight Games. I play a ton of games, and have read many, many game manuals. Let's just say that there's room for improvement in this one. There aren't enough game play examples and some of the game terminology is confusing. I can't recall a game where I spent more time scrambling through the rules to find answers to questions, and then questioned the answer yet again. In typical FFG fashion, you receive a Learn to Play guide which throws you into the basics of gameplay, and a Rules Reference where the real meat of the game can be found. I normally love this approach to learning a game, but Warhammer Quest feels as if it was forced out of the womb by C-section rather than natural birth.

Another problem with card games like this where you shuffle a deck with monsters of various levels of horribleness is the "First Turn=Instant Death" syndrome, where you reveal a truly viscous boss character card on your first turn while another nasty nemesis is already in play from the scenario setup. Yippee! Now you know within a turn or two they'll have chunks of your heroes in their lower intestines and the game will end. Wasn't that fun? I know for some people this kind of challenge gives them the motivation to get out of bed in morning, but I have always found it vexing and anticlimactic.

The components are excellent quality as you'd expect from FFG, but there's just not that much of them in here. 6 dice, some cardboard chits and around 250 cards. Don't over pay for this one.

To summarize, if you buy this at a good price, with some future expansions I think Warhammer Quest could grown into a great franchise, but "as is" out of the box you might be disappointed.

UPDATE: This game is unbelievably difficult. A punishing exercise in futility where you never feel you have a chance to finish a quest. Lowing my score to from 6 to 5.

[Played 14 times]

Simple "dungeon crawler" (it does not feel like one) that quickly feels very repetitive (each hero has the same four cards - that at most become "advanced" over multiple games - and possibly a few items). 
Limited options make it a much lighter game than one would expect from the WQ brand, but it is enjoyable (if only for a limited amount of sessions). 

It features abundant luck (from random enemies and locations to every action being resolved rolling dice), just as one would expect from the WQ brand.

It scales poorly (but that's quickly fixed by always using all the characters; they are easy to manage so it is not an issue).

It is blatantly a solo game that lets you split the (already limited) control among multiple players if you so wish (no hidden info, totally open communication, etc.).

It'd have been easy to expand (and it'd have definitely benefitted from it), but the license was terminated so this will remain as it is.

Overpriced.

Great Co-op game. Very puzzly, involves teamwork and forward planning. Leaning towards the tough, but fair. Plays well with 4 players and very enjoyable as a solo game (official rules state play 2 character party with each character getting two moves per round, playing as a 4 character party with one move each is far more fun). The two add-ons give you a bit a choice in which characters to use to form your party. Just a shame no new add-ons will ever come out.

I love the combat system and the nemesis system but this  game doesn't really do it for me. I will keep playing until I've finished the campaign and I hope it will eventually grow on me. 

I've been playing solo and I get the feeling that the game is really best when played as a true coop. I will donate my copy to my office gaming group and maybe it will get a chance to prove itself. Without a stronger solo experience it won't find a perminent spot in my collection. I know it wasn't designed to be a solo game but most of my favorite coop games work just as well solo so I hoped this would be the same.

Rating based mostly on 2 player games. 

The game somehow condenses the outcomes of the original board game into a shorter (and portable) experience while borrowing also additional mechanics (e.g. a time counter) from other games. Instead of many different buffers for your allies, you rely mainly on the card "Aid" which adapts to the situation and varies slightly depending also on the hero. 

However replayability is not so high, and only two additional characters were provided (no additional quests, locations and monsters) before shutting down the game leaving its potential largely unfulfilled (hope now relies on fans good will in providing unofficial variants).

[microbadge=1714]

19-Mar-2016:  Warhammer Quest: ACG pretty much falls right in the middle of Space Hulk: Death Angel and Lord of the Rings LCG from my perspective and gaming experience.  It takes elements of both games and combines them like a peanut butter in my chocolate kind of way.  It has a similar set of action cards to Death Angel, and you must puzzle out the best use of them from turn to turn to fight off the enemies attacking.   And it takes the enemy engagement aspect from LotR LCG by having some enemies in the Shadows and some engaged directly with the characters, sometimes moving back and forth between the two.  There is one location in play at a time, which you must explore to move forward and rid yourself of its possibly harmful location effect…a combination of both games.

However, it doesn’t stop there.  On top of all this, it adds a campaign mode.  A system where both the story and your characters progress over time, as you move from one quest to the next.  Your characters will add new abilities, weapons, and actions to their arsenal.  Enemies will follow you from one quest to the next because you didn’t defeat them the first time.  Do well and complete a quest successfully, and you’ll be rewarded with more goodies.  Fail and you won’t gain as much, making it harder on yourself as you go.  It all comes together wrapped up in a nice package of adventuring, leveling up, and fighting off the Big Bad.

I really like this game.  That doesn’t surprise me as the game is an evolution of two other systems I’m already familiar with and have enjoyed.  I was both excited and skeptical of the campaign system when I first got the game.  I couldn’t see how moving from one quest to the next when you didn’t complete it successfully would work, but I believe it does.  Playing one quest again and again until you win before moving forward isn’t the point.  The narrative of the quests is both specific enough and generic enough that your success or failure will coincide with the overall story in either case.

Enemies are a major part of the game, obviously, and I love how each enemy type is its own system.  There are a set of actions found on the enemy cards which causes them to act and react in different ways when they become active.  Some enemies may move from the Shadows, sicken a character, and slither off back into the Shadows.  And so on.  It’s a fantastic system that adds so much decision and flavor to what might only be a hit-point counter.

But it’s not all roses.  I still have yet to try the game with less than four characters, but the rulebook makes it clear that the game is intended to be played with four.  The game, of course, can be played with less, and I know that it will work perfectly fine.  The only scaling, however, is the number of hit points your characters can take before being defeated.  I just don’t see playing a two-character game, for example, will be as cohesive as a four-character one.

I bring this up because playing a four-character session solo becomes more fiddly and complex the further into the campaign you go.  In the first quest or two, there are less cards in play, less actions to take, less modifiers to track.  But because this is a campaign game and effects, cards, and modifiers all move with you from one quest to the next, they begin to fill up both the table space and player’s headspace.  Each quest has its own “twist” to the rules that you need to remember as well.  There can be a lot going on

Overall, this is a great game.  It takes elements from both Space Hulk: Death Angel and Lord of the Rings LCG and combines them into a fantastic campaign system of adventuring and character progression.  I love how the outcome of one quest will carry over into the next, both good and bad.  Your characters will find new gear to wield, improved actions to take.  Enemies are wonderfully evil, having a different set of characteristics for each type.  They will act in different ways from each other and have different strengths and weaknesses, just like the hero characters.  Combine that with the varying gameplay twists of each quest and you’ll be in a different setting for each one.  There is a puzzly aspect to the cardplay I enjoy.  You aren’t playing individual character actions to fight off what’s in front of you.  You are looking to play a set of cards each round that, when combined, will give you the best hope of success in the whole scope of the game state.  It’s a game of cooperation amongst a group of heroes to overcome the evil forces they are facing.  And it won’t be easy.  But it will be fun.

I played 3 consecutive Delve Quests games during my first session to learn the game.  Of course, I got drilled in all 3 but feel much more comfortable with the game flow.

The aren't many components, but the footprint on the table is still fairly large.  There is a decent variety in the box even in light of the small box.

I generally like the game, and will certainly play more.  The exploding dice really work for me.

Beautiful artwork, cool theme and elegant gameplay make this co-op card-crawl very fun to play. 

Be forewarned: it's not a game of many choices, by any means. But the experience is so immersive and enjoyable that I don't really mind. 

It is a pity that it's almost certainly dead, since FFG and GW parted ways and the ownership of the different licenses cross. There are no expansions (only two new characters), so the lifespan for this one is very limited. A shame, as for me it was thematically a bit more interesting than the Pathfinder (bland), LOTR (too much Tolkien out there) and Arkham Horror (too much cartoony Lovecraft out there) card games.

Its great. It could be compared to Space Hulk in many ways. It is the kind of game that will make you think and plan your strategies almost every single turns, and that is the hallmark of an excellent co-op or solo experience.

I prefer Space Hulk however, for the simple fact that it is easier to setup, to get through a game, and to pack it back into the box. Thus, Warhammer Quest is great when I want something like Space Hulk, but have a bit more time and energy to spare.

[thing=181521][/thing] is an excellent 2-4 player and solitaire game which includes just about everything I look for in a dungeon crawl:
:star: A campaign system where you can record your progress for posterity.  
:star: A town phase in between quests where you can visit two of three locations to train, shop, etc.
:star: Travel to different locations, each with their own effects.
:star: Iconic adventurers that can level up and use weapons, armor, and items. Also, each character has the same basic four actions, how they do them feels quite unique. 
:star: A good variety of monsters that have unique behaviors.  For example, if you are confronted by a Night Goblin Archer, he'll retreat from you then pop you with a couple of arrows.

I can't wait for the expansions!

Surprisingly, making a hack 'n slash dungeon crawl into a board game, or in this case a card game, isn't as fluid as it sounds. This game is super simple, but you wouldn't know it by the rule book. Pretty disappointing overall, as this could have been a huge game for Fantasy Flight.

Excellent co-op game for 2-4 players. It is easy to get started but it has lots of tactical decisions during the quests. What I really like about this game compared to other co-ops is that it is designed for synergy. You can't win without the other players help and you have to work together as a team all the time in order to win the game.

The only downside is the lack of content, there are only six quests in the box and there are no expansion quests available for the game at this time. But it's worth it for as long as it lasts.

I'm a card-game lover. To my very soul. There's no denying.
This is nothing like the other FFG LCGs. This is not better and certainly it is not worse.
It's one of those games you start playing and you go "oh, ok, it's a nice little fun game..." and suddenly you're filled with arrows and monsters attacking you relentlessly and your 21 health points are coming to 3 or 4 and you're like "ok, ok, ok, I gotta foccus and put myself together if I want to win at this"
Lovely game - FFG's art is always amazing.
I wish there were more official expansions, though [that's why it's not a ten].

Was hoping that this would be the dungeon version of Space Hulk - Death Angel, despite no involvement from Corey K.  Sadler Bros confirmed that SH-DA was an influence in the games design, so here's to chalking up another near 100 plays on an FFG title!

UPDATE: It is really fun.  Love the randomness and balance - had some REALLY close games.  First campaign win 12/29/15 - with The Warrior Priest and The Ironbreaker. It was so close, like almost every session of this gem.

After some depressing sessions of not-even-close games, decided to move to three heroes and am REALLY enjoying the extra decisions and gameplay - especially with the newly added expansion heroes.  The games aren't as close, but sessions no longer requires specific heroes to enjoy them.

A refreshing new take on the primary mechanics of Death Angel, only this time actually beatable and not unfairly difficult!

In more detail, this 1-4 player cooperative card game really captures the essence of a dungeon crawl, only without the miniatures and oftentimes complex rules.

This game distills the dungeon crawl experience into four different actions you can take on your turn which you must coordinate with the other players in order to explore locations while simultaneously fending off an innumerable horde of enemies and desperately trying to stay alive!

I have only played through the training mission but I am liking what I am seeing. I would say that this does feel like the LOTR card game and the Space Hulk card game. However there is room for all 3. Space Hulk feels spare and elegant, LOTR very strategic and puzzly: this feels much more boisterous which I would put down to the dice chucking.

I hope this gets some decent support.

"Cooperative fantasy combat card game. To me, the gameplay feels like a very streamlined LotR LCG, but perhaps not streamlined enough. There is randomness, but this is more of a thinky game than a casual romp. There is more direct cooperation than in most co-ops. "

What I like:
- Really clever mechanisms of exhausting and refreshing actions
- Strong cooperative elements of helping each other
- The characters do feel different from one another
- The tutorial is well-done (and only took 20 minutes)

What I don't like
- I prefer "exploration" games over "combat" games, and this is almost all about combat
- I don't like that 2 heroes have to activate twice--it's hard to track solo
- Sometimes an almost-inevitable loss can take half an hour to play out
- The game has a few more rules and effects than I prefer
- The rules had a couple surprising ambiguities

I got this in a trade for a couple games I would have given away, so I knew it might not be a perfect fit for my tastes. I would put the weight around 2.7, with the depth around 2.4 and the complexity around 3.1

For solo play, I put tokens on the cards I activate, to indicate whether it is my first turn or second each round. Using the first-player marker as suggested by Rahdo for 2p still left me confused at times.

I own the FFG Lord of the Rings LCG. The artwork on this game is at times amazing but there are are couple of things about the gameplay that I don't like:

Placing a token on the current location to advance the current quest.

Shadow enemies  - that enemies engage and withdraw. 

Warhammer Quest takes these two elements and adds artwork that isn't as good as LOTR or their Cthulhu-based games. 

Once again, FFG have a game where the mechanics feel arbitrary and put in place just to make the game work so they can ship it, rather that giving us an elegant gameplay experience. Rather than thinking - 'I have to slay this skaven,' I am thinking 'Ok, I have to exhaust this card and place a token there...'

On top of that the game has the same thing that turned me off Arkham Horror as a solo experience - you play for hours even though it became apparent about 30 minutes in that you just aren't going to achieve a win. As with Arkham Horror I stopped the last game I played over 2 hours in with the end far away and no chance of a victory. I just got tired of it an packed it all away.

Disappointing overall.

It has some excitement of trying to beat the bad guys, has cool artwork and engraved dice, but it´s too dependent on dice luck and choices are mostly quite straigt forward. No card-combo playing to make it more interesting either here (all your actions are static cards on the table that you exhaust and later refresh). There is some adventure feel but it is on the weak side and locations/monsters are often repeated. If it had some kind of hand-management and card playing mechanics it would be so much better.

RATING: 6
This is based on about four game sessions, one one attempt through the campaign.

We played four player, and it was just too much of a burden to get rid on enemies. To kill one enemy usually required one person to support and one person to attack, and this includes using the fully powered up attack option, sometimes even with a weapon (although the gear we got was fairly lackluster in that department). This usually led to a snowball effect where we just couldn't keep up with the pace of the game and ended up under a landslide of enemies that would basically kill us in one turn. We did win the first mission, but lost the second. We still had not received any Legendary Gear by this time, so the third mission was basically a complete exercise in futility. The fourth mission... we called it early when it was clear there was no way to win. We tried different tactics, like just exhausting the enemies and exploring, but they just piled up way too fast and it only takes one good attack to bleed, disease, and basically render you on death's door. 

TL;DR - It wasn't fun enough to overcome the frustration that went with snowballing losses.

Some similar mechanics to "Space Hulk: Death Angel", and light elements of Descent 2e (character/ability development, multi-quest campaign), though lacks the tactical movement of Descent.

With it being entirely card-based (plus dice & a few tokens), this may become a very compact/portable & quick-playing stand-in for questing/dungeon-type games eg. Descent. Hopefully will have sufficient depth & replayability to remain interesting over time.

Expansions will almost certainly follow.

Playing solo with 2 characters at the moment.  It's ok and I think I'd just rather play Lord of the Rings LCG over this.  The dice are sometimes really nasty to you and the randomness of the item and event decks you make can either make or break your run through a dungeon.  Asides from the different enemy types being either orcs or skaven, there's not a whole lot of Warhammer Quest feeling in this game.

Tough game. Still trying to figure out a good strategy.

If this game took 45 minutes I would love it. The fact that it often takes closer to an hour and a half has me quickly falling out of love with this game. For that time commitment I would much rather play almost any other game on my shelf. Because of this I traded it in the January '17 Math Trade.

This is a great game that has a small footprint and has a nice story for the dungeon crawl.  It's a shame that it won't have any future expansions due to the GW split, but for the price, it's worth jumping into this one and givign it a go. You'll get a dozen plays out of it and that's good mileage for any game.

Warhammer Quest The Adventure Card Game. One VERY enjoyable Card game that truly gives you the vibes that you are actually dungeoncrawling in the world of Warhammer.
Does take some time though to get properly into the rules, since they are quite vague. But once into it, the game rox and extremely enjoyable.

The perfect combination of RPG and adventure game.  It is difficult enough to give me the feel of being over run by Skavin, goblins and wolves without feeling impossible. The campaign mode allows me to build my character/s up to meet bigger bad guys.  Play is tight and relatively quick for this type of game.  If I had anything to grumble about, and it is a tiny grumble, it would be the dual rule books.

All the fun of an adventure card game without all the downtime and upkeep.  I love Lord of the Rings LCG and Pathfinder ACG's, but both of those require you to plan and setup your decks (I personally enjoy this part as much as the game itself).  Warhammer Quest ACG however condenses all of that to 4 actions, 2 upgrade choices per campaign session, and still feels incredibly deep.  Super easy to break in new players (something that is incredibly hard for the two previously mentioned games).

The more I play the WHQ Adventure Card Game, the more I am impressed. This is a game that packs a lot of dungeon crawl feel into a tight package. Everything is here: monsters, exploration, character advancement, and delicious dice-chucking. Two elements in particular stand out to me. First of all, the scenario design in the campaign is excellent. It finds ways to do a lot of interesting narrative flourishes with different mechanical nuances. The other impressive quality is the AI that controls the enemies. All of the enemies behave in ways that make lots of thematic sense, without drowning in card text. The character design is another strong point. The different classes all have their strengths, and there is a lot of depth to learning how they can interact with each other, especially given all of the other variables that go into determining how the game goes, like random gear drops and what dungeon locations show up. The campaign is structured in such a way that it doesn't feel like an enormous burden to push through it, and if you want a single session the delve quest gives you all of the character advancement in roughly two hours or so. This is a very fun game, and if it has legs into the future its rating could go up.

I think that Marco Arnaudo got it right when he suggested that this was "Lord of the Rings LCG lite with dice." I found it quite enjoyable, though in terms of depth it pales in comparison with LOTR LCG. I've only played it with two players so far. I'd like to try it with four. There's little chance I'll be able to play LOTR LCG with four, so this might be a decent alternative for game night.

A clever adaptation a la Space Hulk: Death Angel - tactical miniatures combat without board or minis. C

Monster tactics are interesting, player options likewise. Suited to solo play, but plays multi-player very well.

Hopefully will see a few interesting expansions - a few more character choices and a few more monsters would really put this game up a few notches. The campaign system is fun, but perhaps could achieve original WHQ perpetual play with just a few tweaks? 

Thank you FFG for another game in a sensible-sized box!

For solo-play and simplicity, try SH: DA first. For long-running campaign and character development, Pathfinder ACG. For in-depth tactical choices, Mistfall. For something that combines the three, WHQ: TACG.

[1 play] Not my style of game and I find the fantasy theme more and more to be my least favorite theme of all.

That said, I do try to approach games with an open mind. But with this game, my sense was that my decisions were either obvious or meaningless time after time. It was as if the game's designers isolated the clunky combat system of Fury of Dracula and we played it as a game for 3 hours.

I like the idea, but the implementation leaves something to be desired. Much like Shadowrun: Crossfire, this game likes to throw curves that may not be solvable.

RATING: 7
This game basically feels like a more streamlined smaller form factor Descent.  In this game each player controls a fantasy hero and is trying to accomplish a mission, usually by completely exploring all the locations that are part of that quest.  Each round the heroes each get to perform one action, either attacking, exploring, aiding another hero, or healing.  When an action is taken it is exhausted until that player uses the specific action that refreshes the rest but that specific action is usually their weakest.  When the players are finished activating the enemies each activate, then the location special effect happens, and the timer ticks down which often results in the boss monster wreaking havoc.

It is very streamlined and easy to pick up but the game itself is tough, at least starting out before any of the players have upgraded in town.  That's pretty much what you want out of a cooperative game.  I liked the tension and it certainly encouraged party-wide discussion and planning.  There also is a bit of luck involved with dice rolls determining action effectiveness but also a lot of ways to mitigate this luck with success tokens, equipment, etc.  This reaches a nice balance.

I liked the game overall.  I think it lacks a depth of content.  In 1 game plus the tutorial we saw a lot of the monsters, treasure cards, etc. that come in the initial offering.  There is always the hope that they release expansions to increase the amount of content available but that's always a crap shoot.  Some games are popular enough to get more content, others aren't.

Thoroughly entertaining and challenging solo play. Rules are pretty well written, though lack of any kind of organisation in the box makes learning to play harder than it should be (compared to Pathfinder ACG for example). Also compared to Pathfinder it seems overpriced for what you get. 
Finally, its worth bearing in mind that there will be no further expansions for this... and sadly it really needs some expansions.

THE solo fantasy card game - succeeds in a crowded arena of other games (Rune Age, LotR, Death Angel, Pathfinder) by being king of the ring. I hope they are careful when expanding this - new heroes, new items, new quests, but don't fiddle with the mechanics! Well designed, challenging, but most importantly, fun. I've seen some complaining about the rules, but just read both books through - it doesn't take long, and everything you need is in there somewhere.

I have played through the campaign twice now and the delve 3 times. I have really enjoyed this game. It is a good co-op. It is a good puzzle. It simulates a dungeon crawl with an elegant system. It is challenging. You really do have to be good this game to succeed. Looking toward the future, it looks to be incredibly expandable and I can't wait for more content to come out. On the downside, I found the rules to not be great. There were things that were vague and the organization was not the best. The first number of plays always included searching through the rules. I recommend using the unofficial FAQ, found on Boardgamegeek. But once we mastered the rules, the system is quite impressive.

A good dungeon/fantasy 'D&D' style romp. The action is full on from the beginning and each location is full of angry monsters to defeat. There is no exploration as such other than completing one location card and flipping over the next but.... Somehow it still works and evokes and atmospheric dungeon crawl experience. Plays well solo. A good purchase that I expect to get quite a bit of (solo) play....

The widespread criticisms of the Warhammer Quest Adventure Card Game rule book are justified--few games that I've played are made harder to learn by the included guide than is this one.  Primarily, the table layout and flow of the game (especially engagement and combat) should have been detailed with examples that last full turns of a full game: Without online excursions, I would be playing this game incorrectly. I learned much heavier games like Mage Knight, D-Day at Omaha Beach, Conflict of Heroes, Advanced Squad Leader Starter Kit 1 & 2, Thunderbolt Apache Leader, and many others from the rule book alone, which is my preferred method.

In any case, this irritating obstacle is a hindrance to what eventually turns out to be a very fun dungeon crawler that has nice artwork, a wry sense of humor, atmosphere, and excitement. The creatures are distinct, and their programming with counterattacks as well as multifaceted activations (wherein foes advance, retreat into the shadows, hurt heroes, hurt their own peers, exhaust heroes, etc.) give them a whole bunch of personality, which only enriches the game world.  The customized dice are also clever, and like many, I relish the opportunity that exploding dice may bring. At times, a critical hit is the lone hope of an overwhelmed hero.

Other than the rulebook, I don't have many criticisms, though I'd rather my character simply dies when defeated, rather than continue forward...with impediments to another quest.  It took more effort than it should have to internalize this fairly straight forward game, but ultimately, the detailed environments, the strategic dilemmas, the rich art, the sturdy components, and the well-programed villains make the effort worthwhile.

The game isn't too bad - but something just doesn't click. For starters, the game is far too easy. While the campaign doesn't require you to win every games (which I think is great) only one of the four (?) games was at least a bit challenging. We even won the Delve Quest at the end (barely, to be honest - but still won). The ruleset looks good in theory but it didn't really deliver during gameplay and stayed rather bland. I also feel, that the characters are unbalanced - which shouldn't be a big thing in a co-op, but it's frustrating if players feel, that they do not contribute to team effort. Especialy the iron breaker lacks any interesting abilities or legendary treasues.

One of my favorite games is [thing=77423][/thing], which is a heavy inspiration for WHQ:ACG.  I never played the original [thing=1634][/thing], so I'm not really into the universe at all.  But, I've definitely played my share of dungeon crawlers.

I have to say I'm impressed by WHQ:ACG.  It had gotten a lot of buzz lately and for once the buzz didn't lead to disappointment.  There are definitely a lot of similarities to LotR:TCG.  Exploring a deck of locations by placing progress, killing a deck of enemies where the enemies are either engaged with you or in the shadows (a.k.a. staging area).  However, there is no player deck and no deck construction.  So if you aren't into the deck construction, WHQ:ACG offers a much lower barrier to entry.

The player turns are fairly simple.  You have four actions and you pick one of them.  Then that action is used, so next time you have fewer than 4 actions to pick from.  So on one hand, the decisions seem pretty light and simple.  But there can be a lot of semi-long term planning to make sure you can used all of your actions at the right time.  Campaign play is what you would expect from a dungeon crawler.  Leveling up, getting loot, etc.

My biggest complaint is lack of content.  This game is begging for expansions.  In that regard, it feels pretty similar to just the core set of [thing=77423][/thing].  Personally, I love the deckbuilding in the card game, so WHQ:ACG will always be second fiddle.  But, the card game has gotten too complicated and difficult for my wife to enjoy, so now we have another co-op that we can play together.

UPDATE: The FFG - Games Workshop split killed this game for me.  It really needed more content.  I'm hopeful that someone will build on WH:ACG and make something better.

I love this game! Fantasy Flight just knows how to make games that resonate with me. You've got a fairly simple game system (although the rules are not the best) and just tons of variety within that system (different quests, heroes, equipment, enemies, locations). It's awesome and it feels different from most co-op games.

Let me back up a little bit. When I first saw that this had the subtitle "The Adventure Card Game" I was immediately turned off. I only played the Pathfinder ACG once, but that was enough to know that it wasn't for me. But luckily this game is much, much different (and better). For one, the campaign is much more manageable here. You play through a few quests, and between each quest you can get certain upgrades. There is a sheet you can use to track your progress, but minimal bookkeeping is needed (especially compared to Pathfinder ACG). It seems like you could even complete a whole campaign in one sitting if you wanted to commit an entire day to it.

Then I heard that the game was more similar to the Lord of the Rings LCG. After playing both games, that comparison is spot-on. WQ feels like a streamlined LotR LCG, but it allows for more players and campaign play. Also, you don't have to build a deck of cards (which could be good or bad depending on your perspective).

At this point they haven't announced any expansions, but based on the huge success of this first print run and FFG's track record, I'm really excited to see what they add to this game.

Update: I've played this quite a few times now and I still love it. Just a couple of things I'm not crazy about though:

The difficulty. I know the rulebook even mentions that the game is intentionally set to a high difficulty, but some of the quests (especially quest 3) just feel hopeless. I would have proffered some sort of official difficulty adjustment (maybe each hero starts the campaign with 1 upgrade of their choice) to make the game at least [i]slightly[/i] easier and I still hope they'll do something like that in the future.

My second slight issue is the setup and teardown. Even though the game is nothing but cards, this can take some time because of the way you have to separate the different decks. You can store your enemies by type because each quest dictates that you use certain sets of named enemies, but then you have to shuffle up the remaining enemies to fulfill the random "open enemy group" requirements. So you always have to both group enemies together, and shuffle the remaining enemies, so their setup will always take a lot of time no matter how you store them. Locations are similar but there aren't as many of them so it doesn't take quite as long.

Update update: I originally had this rated a nine and I have to admit that my original enthusiasm was to a large extent based on the expected expansions. The game in the box is fine, but I was imagining all the eventual new scenarios and going back through the base campaign with all sorts of new heroes and equipment.

With the game being dead that won't happen now (at least not until FFG rethemes it in a few years). I've now updated my rating to reflect this as a standalone game. It's still good, but with the fairly static setup of each scenario there's not much reason to play through it over and over.

Luckily the Arkham Horror LCG is out now and it perfectly fills the role that I was expecting this game to take on. A few of the mechanics are similar, but more importantly there is a steady stream of new stuff that will be coming out. New heroes/investigators, scenarios, entire campaigns. While I'm sad that this game never got to live up to its potential, I'm really glad to have the Arkham Horror card game.

I traded this for Pathfinder:Skull & Shackles just before the announcement that this game will not be supported anymore (i.e. no possibility of expansions).

If they do a re-skin there is a big chance that I will re-invest. That is, provided they can "confirm" that it will be supported.  Since it's up to Fantasy Flight to make that call, I am fairly confident this is the eventual path. I guess we'll see.

It never did overtake Thunderstone:Advance or Dungeon Crawler the way I thought it would. 

Good about the game: The "shadows" mechanic is pure theme, and I LOVE the combat system.
Not good about the game: Persistent rules confusion.

Rules are a mess. You can find the answer to many questions  on the forums, but there still are some unresolved ones.

Gameplay is fast an furious. Select an action, roll some dice. Fun ans satisfying.

There is a decent amount of interaction in the game, and a small amount of planning is needed.

Campaign is super-fun, scenarios feel different.

Delve quest is semi-broken.

Low replay value, finish the campaign 3-4 times, and that's it.

Do you like Warhammer fantasy? Do you like RPGs? Do you like Dungeon Crawling and getting loot?

Get this game (if you can, since it's out of production due to the breakup between FFG and Games Workshop.

You control atleast 2 heroes and the heroes have 4 action cards. Using those action cards you rush through dungeons, slaughter masses of creatures and try not to die. 

I like this game a lot but I gave it an 8 due to the rules sometimes feeling a little clunky to me (Peril Track & enemy actions being confusing when starting out), and because of the out of production status while there isn't all that much content.

Luckily there is a lot of love from the community which spawned numerous extra scenario's and monsters! However I cannot include that in my rating seeing how I only rate the official retail products. If you don't mind printing some cards, this game will keep you busy for a long time!

About [thing=181521][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=181521][/thing] is a card game of medieval fantasy adventure, whose mechanics are influenced by [thing=133038][/thing], by [thing=77423][/thing], by [thing=71721][/thing] and even reminded me a little bit of [thing=128445][/thing] due to the use of actions. 

Is a cooperative game, based on scenarios, each with a unique challenge, foes and locations, which isn't the most fun to set up, but it didn't take as long as I thought it would.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
After setting up the scenario, accordingly to a sheet each one has, players pick the hero they want to play and the four action cards of the hero. Each hero have only 4 cards, and these are:
- Rest: recover life;
- Fight: attack enemies;
- Explore: put markers on the location, to advance to the next place. During the explore action, players take Events from the dungeon deck, and have a chance of finding items and equipaments;
- Aid: give successes to another hero and ready one of her action cards.

At each turn the player can make one action. After the action is done, the card is exhausted and can't be used again, until one one particular action of the hero (that changes from hero to hero), which can't be exhausted, is used and, coupled with its normal use, it also makes all the other cards be ready for use again.

When doing an action, players roll dice equal to the number showing on the card being used. One black die is added to the roll of each non-exhausted foe engaged with the hero doing the action. Regardless of the result of the black die, the intended action will be done, the black die is there mainly to do damage to the hero and/or to activate the special boss action of the scenario.

After all the heroes execute their actions, all the foes will activate accordingly to their card (some will attack than flee to the shadows; others will not only give damage, but also conditions, like Bleeding and Sickned; others will stay in the shadows, attacking from afar; etc). Than the location will be checked - if it has start of turn effects, it will trigger, regardless of being fully explored; if completely explored, and the heroes choose to, the next one will open, and will bring a set number of foes - some that will directly engage the heroes and some that will stay in the "shadows" (that would be the staging area in LotR) - enemies in the shadows can't be attacked by melee, but heroes can pull them to the fight.

In the scenarios players will have goals to fulfill.

If playing in the campaign mode, after each scenario, players have the opportunity to receive 2 of 3 things: one random equipament; raise the limit of carried equipaments; gain one advance action (replacing the basic one). If players won the scenario, one legendary equipament will be added to the equipament deck. If they lost, normally the boss of the mission will enter in the enemy deck of the next mission, making it harder to beat.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which action to use. That will be the main decision of the whole game and made several times. Due to the exhaustion mechanic for the actions, the decision is, for one side, made easier, as you have less options to pick from, but, for the other, the timming to use them becomes much more important, as not having a key action in a moment of need can mean the defeat of a hero and/or losing a scenario.

So yes, you can use Fight now. But how is the next turn looking? And what is happenning with your companions? Maybe Aid is the way to go, as someone might be handling a bigger threat or can do something better than you right now. Or Explore, as advancing to the next location, while bringing new foes, is what is necessary to not fall behind in the scenario internal clock.

The second tier of decision-making is: which enemy to fight? The player must choose before rolling the dice, and this also takes into consideration foes in the shadows, as engaging one of them allow for a direct attack, but also means that they will add one black die to your rolls until you have dealt with it.

These will be the pillars of the decisions in the game: actions - timming - enemies.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Truly a cooperative game;
- Easy to start playing - no need to build your hero deck: just take the 4 cards and you are ready to go;
- Great art on the cards;
- Campaign mode, which includes not only chained scenarios, but also increasing the abilities of the heroes and carrying equipaments from one adventure to the next;
- Good amount of theme for a card game;
- Fine amount of unique enemies.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Medium to low replay value. This caught me a little off guard. Not I wasn't expecting the need of expansions, but after playing, I notice that:
a) the scenarios seem more balanced for 4 players, which means that, even when playing with less then 4 (but probably not solo), all 4 heroes will most likely be used. The base game should come with 5 or 6 heroes;
b) the advancements during the campaing will normally be: one extra slot of equipament and one advanced power. This is because equipaments the heroes can gain during the scenarios, and the other two, no. This will make that, by the end, the hero have all of their advanced actions. Expansions might (and probably will) add new variant advanced actions, but, until then, you are stuck with one for each type and you will definitely get all of them;
c) the way the scenarios work make that all the locations and, normally, all the monsters, are known and used (but the locations used do change from game to game). The locations and the creatures don't form one deck, and there isn't "shadow effects" (of LotR) that make some cards appear in a different way and not in the normal way (like a powerful Troll showing as a shadow effect, and this will effect and change one play of the scenario to another in the same scenario). This makes the scenarios much less replayable, even less than those of [thing=133038][/thing], as though the locations are the same, the contents in them change.
- High amount of luck coming from several dice rolls, can make some plans void.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like actually being part of a team going in an adventure. I didn't extended when I said in the good things "truly a cooperative game", because is a feeling matter more than anything else. [thing=181521][/thing] offers more cooperation between players than that found in [thing=77423][/thing], in [thing=71721][/thing] and in [thing=133038][/thing].

The Aid action [thing=181521][/thing] ins't the ugly duckling of the 4 available. Is, on the contrary, one of the best ones in the lot. So consider that, normally, around 25% of the actions done in the game will be done to help others. While one could argue that 33% of actions could in [thing=71721][/thing] could be Support, these are not in the same level of usefulness - support tokens are good enough, but the they aren't as good as attacking nor activating important features of the location or positioning properly. In WQA the Aid action isn't done with a grunt and a "well, since I can't do nothing better...", which is a common fell in Death Angel with the Support. Pathfinder has almost nill cooperation, except when using certain characters and weapons. LotR, without Ranged heroes, has more of the cooperation that comes from the same goal, but not proper "I help you", so I have my problems, the other player has their own, and we both must find a way to travel foward.

So kudos for the designers, for making WQA a game with high cooperation.

Still, the low replay value is a big issue. One that can be solved with expansions, and Fantasy Flight isn't shy of them. But we do have cases of games dropped into the twilight without expansions, and, for now, I can't say the way this will go. Nonetheless, [thing=181521][/thing] is far from a "one and done" purchase, so be warned.

In the end, I enjoyed the game, the whole gameplay is easy to grasp, the rules on the cards are clear enough, so we rarely had to consult the manual, and the simplicity of it makes for a lower bar to enter than LotR or Pathfinder (basically the same of Death Angel), even if someone just hands you the deck and says "just read the cards and rock on", simply because you won't really know your deck, but the 4 cards in front of you, you will. And the game has enough depth, with the timming, scenario requirements, unique enemies AI, to warrant continued interest.

RATING: 8
A nice combination of the Pathfinder Card Game and Lord of the Rings LCG, and a bit of an evolution from the Space Hulk: Death Angel card game.

I like the simplified character development (i.e. either upgrade 1 of 4 actions, or get more gear), although the lack of diversity in upgrade paths is stifling.

The main issue is that the game is ripe for campaign expansions, and nothing is coming because of the FFG / GW divorce. A bit of variety can be had with trying different combinations of heroes, although the game seems most balanced at 4 player anyway.

Still an enjoyable experience.

RATING: 6
Something in this one leaves me underwhelmed.

It might be that the game is "too" cooperative, so it feels more like you are managing the game (a la Pandemic) than playing a dungeon crawl.  So, I much prefer Pathfinder's version to this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Most of what I've said about Shadowrun: Crossfire can be applied here. This is a delightfully thematic co-op dungeon-crawler that manages to recreate the experience without any board, miniatures or tactical movement. And while I don't think it's nearly as difficult as Shadowrun, it certainly has that "legacy" appeal in spades.

Yes, your characters will team up on adventures to defeat monsters and collect treasures. Perhaps the most interesting aspect though, is between adventures, where you get to level-up, acquiring better skills and better gear.

Again like Shadowrun, you've got several different roles and each role is intended to perform a different function. Some want to stand on the front lines, while others focus on searching for the objective. The way that WHQ:ACG abstracts the experience of wandering a dungeon and fighting monsters is actually really clever and it has much more depth to it than you might expect.

The game's greatest strength is in it's potential for "campaign play". In the box is a series of 5 scenarios, each building upon the last. And, sadly, this will ultimately be the game's demise...because, as it was announced not so long ago, Games Workshop has pulled the rights, meaning this game that had so much potential, will never get the expansions that could have made it flourish.

As of right now, this game is still a great experience. It only makes me sad that it's fate seems now destined for descent into obscurity, rather than as a shining beacon of a new generation of adventure games.

RATING: 8
Lord of the Rings: The Card Game used to be one of my favorite games. I loved the theme, the deck building, and the game play of it, but once I got into Netrunner the idea of spending time playing-but-not-really-playing two games didn't appeal to me. I sold my very large collection and moved on, only occasionally looking back at LoTR: LCG with rose-tinted glasses and a hint of regret.

Well, I can get rid of the regret (and I can't quite pull off rose-tinted glasses) because Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game keeps the best parts of LoTR: LCG's mechanics while ditching the giant, constantly changing card pool and deck building. It can be played with anywhere from 1-4 players out of the box (LoTR: LCG needed a second core set to play any more than two players) and each character feels unique and useful.

The addition of dice had me excited from the start. Instead of swingy shadow cards affecting the enemy, you now have dice to contend with and some of those dice benefit you and very occasionally those dice can really benefit you as they explode over and over again.

Basically, this kills any desire I had to play Lord of the Rings: The Card Game every again. It removes my chief complaints about the system (deck building, too-big card pool) while adding something fun and exciting (dice!).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Card game filler co-op version of Warhammer in the old world. Scenario based with LotR similarities. Dice driven combat and aid. The scenario cards are well designed to track progress.  Eight to ten hours to play throuh, characters level up to face increasingly difficult challenges. I think the miniatures, move dudes on grids, is needed to capture the excitement that the encounters are supposed to elicit...

UPDATE: I've changed my mind, after watching it played, I like that it is a small footprint without moving dudes on a grid, easy to take traveling and get in a light fun dungeon crawl. Pretty amazing how much game and adventure fits in such a small box. Very challenging to win which is a good thing.

I grew impatient and tried to learn the game from the original rulebook.  Mistake! These are some of the worst mass-market rules that I've read in a long time.

The Learn to Play guide is vague and misleading, and its organization is as confusing as it is bizarre.  The tutorial is pointless, as it deals with a stripped-down scenario that is only tenuously connected to the standard game, and the "advanced" rules (the standard rules!) are presented as a random scattering of topics.  No rhyme, no reason, no class.

Also, there are two separate Quest Setup sections in the Rules Reference (pp. 2 & 12) - and they're not identical? What the hell?

The take-home message: The two-booklet FFG approach only works if the Learn to Play guide is any good.  If not, it's a total disaster.  I don't know whether to blame Games Workshop, FFG, or both, but certain key personnel need to refund their holiday bonus checks and be relocated to Accounting.

By the way, major props go out to [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1482162/unofficial-faq]this thread[/url] for rules clarifications.

[i]Update #1:[/i]

After numerous stops and starts, I finally have the rules down. The rulebook still needs an overhaul, but I won't belabor that point any further.

I can see myself dashing through the full campaign with different groups, mostly because it's only five scenarios long.  So the campaign's brevity is a positive in this case.

FFG has always been excellent at cannibalizing (frankensteining?) mechanics from its other games, and WQ:ACG is a showcase in this regard.  Nicely done!

[i]Update #2:[/i]

The overall design is excellent, but I now despise the game's extreme difficulty and reward/penalty campaign structure.  If a party fails a scenario, it isn't necessary to add another penalty as a disciplinary measure, thereby making it even harder to win later scenarios.

In comparison, I really like [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37046/ghost-stories]Ghost Stories[/url], despite its insane difficulty.  Going into a session, I know there's an 80% chance that we won't be successful, and I'm prepared for it.  But when I lose, I'm not punished further by making the next three sessions even more difficult/impossible.   Under those conditions, there's a good chance that I would stop playing altogether.

In WQ:ACG, in our case, we lost the second scenario and things went rapidly downhill from there.  Previous nemeses were added to the campaign pool, then the warpstone, and now we're screwed from here on out.  That's... fun?

Call me a sore loser, but I prefer 'lost' rewards to be delayed rather than permanently eliminated.  E.g., if we lose a scenario, its associated legendary fortune card is added to the pool after a one-scenario delay, not totally throttled.

[i]Update #3:[/i]

The final campaign scenario was a depressing defeat, as was the delve quest.  The delve Abomination - which can only be survived, not killed - is the least fun 'boss' that I've encountered in any board game.

[i]Update #4:[/i]

After replaying the campaign (x2) and delve quest (x4) with the base game characters, I've lowered the game's rating due to extreme cruelty. In a multiplayer setting, each additional WHQ participant makes it harder to win because they have a mind of their own and don't cater to your every demand.  Many co-ops are like this, but this game is the most egregious example.  Plus, playing a full campaign without winning a single game - particularly with new players - doesn't motivate people to try again.

When using the basic heroes, I'm definitely using the 'easy' variant from now on: Each hero starts the campaign/delve with a random advanced action, a random legendary gear card, and an extra gear slot (i.e., two slots to start).

The art is awesome, I'll give it that.  The rulebook ... well, the rulebook is terrible.  It is really bad.  Normally I'm a fan of Fantasy Flight's two book system, but this one is missing so much information it makes the game difficult to play.  I had multiple questions while playing, and after reading the full "learn to play book" as well as relevant sections of the "rules reference", I had to just guess as to what was intended for 2-3 different situations.  The answers were nowhere to be found.  Game-play wise, it's ok for now - I'm not blown away but I can see some potential.  I suspect my rating would improve with more plays and less time spent looking up rules.

Another very interesting game by FFG with a great theme (I love the Warhammer universe) that ended up being dismissed too soon.
The game is nice, I love the theme and there is great artwork and an interesting game play. Some people compared it to Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (with some elements from The Lord of the Rings: the card game by FFG), but I think this is a little bit of a stretch.
In this regard, I believe Warhammer Quest is much less deep and engaging with respect to Pathfinder and I would never replace one with the other (as others suggested).
Given the lack of support for this game, the low re-playability and the reduced number of choices available in a game, I was slightly disappointed by it.

Strict BGG rating for the solo experience. Played LotR LCG, stopped before the first expansions, I'd say this is similar but more bloody. 

I enjoyed the first quest, which I thought was going to be a walkover going through to the second location, though I was overwhelmed in the penultimate location. It's pretty brutal, but then that's the way you want it, there's a lot going on mechanistically and playing the first quest ironed out the rules.

Lots of theme and flavour here, a nice diversion when in the mood.

Good : 
* plays like Death Angel but with less randomness and no lucky stressful die roll (still dice but strongly mitigated). 
* variety in quests
* action management and support your fellow players, teamplay
* warhammer fantasy feel
* monster activation system with little 'ai'
* nemesis
* tempo of quests with peril track
* dungeon deck
* good mechanisms overall

Still lacks : 

* more variety in cards especially monsters
* feels a bit mechanically
* more diverse monsters

The weak: 

* location exploring isn't very exciting (weakest thing out of Lotr Lcg)

Would like to see: 

* more skills per character to choose from
* more complex monsters

RATING: 7
Rating based on 2 plays of 2 player.
Suprisingly deep thinking game considering you only get 8 actions each in the whole game.

Not sure it is my thing.  Feels a bit like Chess in terms of thinking a lot of moves ahead.

If you are looking for an enjoyable twist on area majority that plays quickly, then this game is for you. I felt very constrained by the 8 actions I had for the whole game, but employed a balanced strategy and managed to win with a tiebraker. I'm curious to see how the British can effect the game... we didn't see them win any territories, but I think that was due to lack of experience with the game. I'll happily keep playing this, but I don't feel the need to own it.

Tug war. That is the first thing coming into my mind when thinking about this game. You do a move, and the opponent immediately counters it. You have symmetric decks so it really is a question of analysing the potential of the initial setup. Not too fond of this one.

RATING: 7.5
Hmm...I like this, but on of my group hated it.

On the postive side, it's fairly brain-burning in the middle and end games. It's good to look at, the theme is an interesting  one (if a little abstractly tacked on), it plays quickly and once you understand the rules, it's easy to get on with.

On the negative side, it's hard to get to grips with the rules on the first play - it's counter-intuitive in that you don't play a faction, and there are some fiddly bits for such a short game.  The rules aren't easy on first play - it's maybe best to get an experienced player to explain them.  Also, the start game is pretty random - you cannot make many plans there, apart from maybe which cards to hang on to.

I like it and think it fits a nice gap in the market - a short, slightly brain-burning, area-control filler.  Whether I'll like it more or less after further plays reamins to be seen.

Excellent game. Area majority but with an original take. You only have 8 actions in the entire game, each player having identical sets of action cards. The game structure is formed by the resolution of each of 8 Siamese provinces between 3 factions, so there's decision-making pressure right from the start. Players don't represent the factions, but collect pieces to show their influence with each one. There are two alternative and opposing victory conditions to take into account. For one victory condition the winner is the player who has removed from the board the most pieces from the faction that controls the most regions, so you're trying to manipulate the leading factions with fewer and fewer pieces available. The second victory condition happens if 4 or more provinces are drawn (represented by the British taking over); in this case, you win by having sets of all three faction colours.

I rate this as one of the best games of the show this year. It's themed, rather than historical. Simple and clean mechanics with originality, lots of tense decision-making, combined with good quality components, a good price and much player interaction.

Games should reward players for accomplishing interesting goals. Games should never penalize players for doing something fun. Playing cards is fun. Changing the board is fun. By never drawing new cards, and never being able to pick up discarded cards, players are punished in later rounds if they exhausted their cards earlier.

RATING: 5
An area control game with - reminiscent of  Liberte - the cubes representing political factions that the players manipulate.  King of Siam plays quickly, with control of one of eight provinces resolved each round and players having identical hands of just eight El Grande style cards to play all game.

I think that here lies one of the problems with this game; it's all so stripped down and symmetrical that players tend to cancel each other out.  Resort to the tie-breakers is frequent. 
 
There's also an issue with the early game not really mattering.  The board situation is so changeable and your actions are so limited that pursuing a game-long strategy is all but impossible.  Early turns feel like no more than an extended set-up, preparing for the end game.

Very good area-control game. its a very symmetrical game. Players compete for the control of Siam. Easy to teach and fast to play. Players have only 8 actions for the whole game so you better make them worth. Standard quality components. Tight gameplay. It was designed as a 3-players game. I should also try the 4-player variant.

A fast paced political game, with some depth and a game mechanism that I have not see anywhere else. Taking pawns away from the board to get the majority while weakening your own favorite makes the game interesting. The only drawback is that it has fairly low reply value, this is why my rating is 7 until I get to play more and see if the game can still be interesting.

RATING: 9
January 2012:  King of Siam is a distinctive and different sort of game.

In particular, each player has the exact same set of cards, with the exact same set of distinctive card effects on each card, looking at the exact same board, operating under the exact same set of rules. No dice rolls, no surprising new card, or card effect coming into play through chance, not even a hint or glimmer of luck. Not that such gaming characteristics are anything particularly exotic...chess and virtually every abstract game you will ever play (eg Blokus) can be characterized as such. But...

In King of Siam, the simple but pleasing mechanics very nicely create short term, medium term, and long term effects, that cause you to constantly adjust your short term, medium term, and long term strategy and tactics. And all of this information is very accessible and visible to you on...let's face it...a very simple board.

You feel like you really should be able to figure out the puzzle in front of you...because it is in a relatively simple and accessible form. And, of course, when you do figure out the puzzle, you feel pretty good about the whole thing. A game that is perhaps not fireworks...but good in a very quirky way.  I give it an 8.

April 2012:  After playing this a few times now with three, I think this game is very much of a classic, very chess-like.  Raising my rating to a 9.

June 2014:  Still a brilliant classic.

I’ll start with what initially doesn’t excite me about this game.

* Tie breakers and tie breaker tie breakers are needed the majority of the time. I like that the games are close but I do miss clear and definitive wins. They maybe happen occasionally but I haven’t seen one yet, granted I’ve only played a handful of times. 

That is about it, so far.

Tactics and strategies were very opaque in the first game, what I could do and plan for all seemed to be just a stab in the dark. After every game I’ve played so far though I’ve come away with ideas and plans for how I could improve my play for the next session. The game is revealing itself like the skins of an onion.    

At the moment I slightly prefer playing with 2 rather than 3. I think once I get a handle on the 2 player game I could progress to the 3 without feeling so overwhelmed. I haven’t played the partnership game yet but with four players who know what they are doing it looks like it would be very interesting.   

It is hitting all the right notes for me at the moment I can see this being one of my classics. With its simple rules, minimal luck and deep game play I predict this entering my top 10.

(I bought 4 extra British markers from the publisher. I feel that aesthetically it needs them to look right. All the other factions use 8 so the British only having 4 was odd. I have gaming OCD so it was like poking pins in my eyes. Like me, they use an extra 4 British markers on Yucata.de so I’m not the only one who thinks 8 is the correct amount.)

This game reminds me of the quote, "A designer knows he has achieved perfection, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."  I'm inclined to think that the design is deliberately thoughtful rather than just terse.  Lots of cube pushing.  Little bit of stock ownership.  Remarkable amount of game for it only having 8 decisions per player, and playing in such a short time.  Found it highly elegant, all the way down to the box size.  I think it may run well with fans of Chicago Express.  Still far from perfect for my own tastes, mostly because - win or lose - I don't feel a great connection between actions and game results, despite having played (and won, and lost) several times.  That's all for the 3P version, though, and it seems that the partnership 4P game (despite a lower BGG recommendation?) offers more control.

RATING: 8
This is a great little area influence game with a tiny twist.  That twist is time.  Players have 8 actions for the entire game, but have the option to play more than 1 action per turn.  It is this decision - to play or not to play - that makes the game really shine.  If you burn your actions too soon, you will run into trouble, but if you hold back it may be too late to have the influence necessary for the win.  There is a lot in this small package.  The game is underappreciated - maybe because people think that simplicity cannot equate to depth.  For me, the game's depth lies in its subtleties.  Combined with speedy play, this is a solid little game.

Plays well as a 2 player or 4 player but each is a very different game feel.  May shine as a solid 3 player.

This one is a tough game to like, but one I did like anyway. I'm not too keen on "these are your cards... you can only use each one once per game" mechanics, but they're quite well though out here. Plus, as the game really plays very quick, you don't miss your used cards for too long.

There are better area majority games out there (with one of the oldest ones, El Grande, still being the best), but for such a short playing time, this one delivers quite a punch.

It is a long time since I sat in the middle of my first game with a smile on my face just as a result of thinking 'this is good'.  Maybe it was as a result of the other games I had just played, but KoS offered lots of choices. a short time frame, no negative constraints on your actions.  Played with four in pairs.  I hadn't expected it to work like that but it worked brilliantly.  Look forward to further plays and maybe an increased rating from an already excellent 8.

If BGG rankings would be calculated by the number of meaningful decisions per rules complexity ratio, Konig von Siam would probably be #1.
It is an extremely elegant, simple and streamlined design, with every chrome scratched away (it is almost abstract): an area majority game with only 8 areas to score and only 8 actions per player. It plays slightly differently if played with 2, 3 or 4 players.
It is a true gem, and I am glad to own it!

Out of Print (OOP).

I can see that this game will be getting more plays with the passing of time. We just tried our first game and made a couple of mistakes.

1. Initially thought that we can only play 1 card per power struggle but this is not true, you can play a card, let the opponent play a card or pass, then play yet another card. Hence, multiple cards can be played for each power struggle.

2. We were initially confused over where to place the control markers -> they are to be placed in the provinces to signify control.

3. There are cubes in each player stockpile, we forget to take this from the common pile.

Since it is fast and enjoyable. I love the area control aspect and how you will try to manipulate the results to meet your objectives.

Played once as a 3-player game.  Being a fan of games with zero luck, it probably comes as no surprise that I enjoyed King of Siam.  It's definitely one of the better fillers available.  The timing of when to play your cards reminds me of Wolfgang Kramer's Bison, which for me is a good thing!  The main downside to King of Siam is that it's over much too quickly for me to grow attached to seeking it out.  However, if I only had time for a quick filler amongst gamers, than this game would probably be it.

I played The King is Dead first but have since played both this map/ version and the Saba version on Yucata several times.  Very quick, very thinky at 2 but still has a nice amount of theme.  At two I need to be in the mood but it works very well.  Great on all counts.  Might just prefer The King is Dead as it would be slightly easier to get to the table though the theme works best for me with this version.

This is teetering on '10' quality. As a partnership game, it's great, but without any hidden information I wonder if the signaling isn't just making up for subpar play. Theoretically, given optimal play, one player could play both hands and it should end up the same as if there were two separate players. I'd like to see the same concept, but with partners holding some information that the other player didn't have. That would probably be an insta-10 for me.

I quite admire the design of this one. Despite being extremely opaque, especially during the early plays- and then again the early game is always a little cloudy. I've only had the chance to play it with 2 and 3 up to this point and say that I prefer the 3P game. The 2P game quiets down the chaos and provides for an even more abstract feel. Those who say it it's a stock game are right. The feeling it gives you as you play cards (well sometimes atleast) is that you're manipulating the market and cashing out, but rather than a bunch of actions in between, the game is so streamlined that you're basically doing both at the same time. Investing and then taking ownership by nibbling a piece of a particular color. The give and take of increasing ownership while simultaneously weakening that color's board position.  It's a mind bender. Little pull and tugs. The unlimited card play is interesting, having to ration your cards most times to have any control in the endgame. The Brittish victory is rare, although it does happen eventually if too many players turtle through some of the early rounds. It adds another level of consideration, a reason to be diverse in cube selection- but of course at a tempo and potential cost to another color, usually your strong suit. Enjoy the jockeying for leader positions in the 3P game because the game starts you going in two directions from the start. 

Overall a beautiful package. It has very functional bits, attractive cardbacks and colorful cardboard tokens. A nice looking game and simple presentation. It has a high score in the "few rules, deep emergent gameplay" category- might be one of the best examples of this concept/design attribute I can think of. The opaque layer of "drying" the board up of a color you intend on on holding creates a barrier of entry, but I think the game can sustain plays even when players get a better feel for the counterintuitive nature of the system. I think even after the players get a better feel for the prior, the game will still be worth playing. I see myself having this one for a while. I hope to have an update about partners at some point!

RATING: 8.1
Very intriguing game. You play to get the most influence in the most succesfull faction. But to gain influence in a faction you have to weaken its board position. Add to that the fact that you only have eight actions to last the entire game and you have a game filled with dillema's and very tough decisions. Original take on the area majority game.

Only played 4 player version so far, where you can't talk to your teammate.Object is to collect the most influence markers of the faction that eventually wins out in a majority control game that is undetermined until the end. 8 turns total. Each turn players decide to play one of their 8 cards to move cubes onto provinces on the board or pass. Whenever they play a card the player gets to remove one cube of their choice from any province on the board. In this way you get 1 cube per card you have. Each player has an identical set of 8 cards to play for the entire game. The winner is the side who has the most cubes of the winning faction's color at the end of the game. Whenever a province is tied the British take it over. If four of eight province come under British control, then the side with the most complete sets of all three colors wins.

Gameplay is interesting (aside from the stupid "can't see any card except the top one" rule); the victory conditions leave much to be desired.  Gheos is a superior game, even with the problems present there.

A unique and interesting area control game where players are manipulating the board to allow certain factions to have the most control while trying to also collect the most influence of that faction. Players can only play 8 cards (i.e. take 8 actions) in the ENTIRE game. It plays very fast and there are lots of subtle tricks that can be played. We found it to work well with only 2 players and play very fast (around 20 mins). While it isn't the best game I've ever played, it is an interesting take on area majority and its fast playtime means it could get off the shelf often. Note that this was recently re-themed to The King is Dead, but the game is basically identical with some minor map changes.

This is a tense area control? area influence? game.  There are 3 factions that are trying to control 8?9? regions.  Players move around cubes to influence which faction controls the region.  Each time they use one of their 8 cards, they get to take a cube from the board.  The goal is to be the player who has the most cubes of the faction that controls the most regions.  I've only played this 2-player and it feels very much like a chess match.  Play your cards early and you may be left helpless at the end, but you may have controlled the board to the point that the second player can do nothing.

Peculiar game in a good way. Game play combines both strategy and tactics, with two possible endings depending on how areas resolve. The small deck of cards also forces the players to be extremelly frugal with their actions. A really unique twist in the genre and probably a hard game to master. Looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 8
One of the top rated games from Essen 07. (#7 on the Fairplay Poll). A quick game of tactics that is quite easy to learn, fast to play, yet provide enough meat to be satisfying. Seemingly simple, but there is depth of strategy. Kudos to the elegance of the game design. Lean and efficient. Not easy to come up with a fresh mechanism for area control which has been done in so many games. Congratulations to the author.

Having played numerous 3 player games, finally tried a 4 player and it was surprisingly tense and interesting. This game's scalability to 2, 3 or 4 players is another bonus.

Make sure the ending conditions and tie breaker scenerios are well understood for there not to be a letdown with the endgame. Nevertheless, sometimes there is kingmaking in the end which does result in a letdown for such a great game.

Clever and simple area control game with clean design. There's enough options for the game to be interesting but it's not overly complex to be to long.

We found out that there might be an issue of king making in the game which is a serious minus for the game.

RATING: 8
Only played twice. A simple game with lots of strategic choices. Over eight rounds you can play eight cards to affect the control of eight locations. Your aim is to predict the faction that will have the most control at the end of the game by collecting the most cubes of that colour. But collecting cubes removes them from the board and makes it harder for that colour to gain more control.

Extremely constrained gameplay -- you'll pick up a maximum of 8 (probably just 7) cubes throughout the game! And the rules are not at all intuitive. Still, it's very quick and could be interesting to play several times with the same opponent. UPDATE: 6 -> 4. The strategy for this game is a little too obscure. I simply don't understand what the hell I'm doing.

 I like it - a refreshingly different approach to area majority and it packs a lot of game into a short time.  Looking forward to playing again.  The use of alternative victory conditions in certain circumstances is slightly reminiscent of Liberte in a good way - meaning you have to stay on your toes rather than just plough ahead blindly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting take on area control.  Only having 8 actions for the entire game means you have to make every play count, and makes decisions surprisingly difficult!  Also since each player only can take a max of 8 actions for the entire game, the works great as a filler which I would have never thought judging by the rules/packaging.

RATING: 3
Game is definitely not for 4.  If the players are at all smart there is enough power in the team who goes second to force a Britain win in the first four regions.  By that time both teams should have identical (or nearly identical) sets which means the team which goes second wins by tie-breaker.  BROKEN GAME for 4!!!! (Not yet had a chance to play 3, but after seeing the play with 4 would be entirely willing to pass.

RATING: 8
[14/11/2007] A very tight and elegant design, which proves there's still plenty of room for novel takes on the area control genre. It is distinctly reminiscent of Liberté in that players merely have stakes in the various factions rather than controlling these themselves. However, while Liberté's card drafting aspect has issues, Der König von Siam offers flawless game design.A particularly delicious decision-poin in the game: Increasing your influence in a faction decreases its presence on the board. Considering how many overwrought and ultimately unfun Euro heavy-weights are published today, this game's a breeze of fresh air. Few recent releases have offered such strategic depth, while being so slim in terms of rules complexity and playing time. Certainly sofar my favourite 2007 release. The modest (yet well-designed) package belies its intriguing content. An 8 is a preliminary rating, merely having played the 3-player version. I might possibly upgrade it should I find the other player configerations as interesting.

Simple rules, easy to grasp, but the important thing is that you'll be working out the decision tree quite often. Because like Poker, often the best play is to do nothing, but you better be sure, because if it's actually in the best interest of the other player(s) to do nothing, then you were supposed to do something.

RATING: 4.5
This is a weird little game! It’s actually quite cool and I don’t recall any games like it. Essentially you’re trying to manipulate 3 different power factions in 8 different regions over 8 rounds. You want to get the majority of power cubes of the power faction which owns the most regions after the rounds. In doing so, each round you can play a card or pass – but you only have 8 cards, so you might run out of cards before the end of the game or a round might just consist of players passing! Oh, and I like that a round doesn’t end until all players have passed in a row, so you can always come back later if you want. What is really neat is that during the game you’re playing cards that add/remove/move cubes from the various regions, and one after one they’re going to score. But after playing a card and for instance adding a yellow cube because you want yellow to win, you also need to grab a cube for yourself in order to gain influence in this faction – so while you’re trying to make yellow win, you also removes some of that faction’s power from the game board during the play! It’s a great balance and works well.

Oh, and I also like that you also need to monitor if the Brits seize the power (i.e. there has been a tie in 4 regions) because then you need sets of cubes in the 3 different powers instead of a majority in one. I would assume this would be most likely to happen in a 2p game, which actually happened once in a game I played. As you can probably tell, the game is extremely fast and plays in about 15-20 minutes for 2 players, making it a nice and different filler.

Not for me. It is all based around everyone having the same fixed set of actions. It is an area control game where you are trying to support the most successful group like Liberte. The trouble is it is so abstracted and dry. The chaotic way in which players can pass and then reenter play before an area scores prevents long term strategy. Neither enjoyable nor particularly interesting.

After two plays - one with three and one with four (i.e. team play) - I think this is a solid 8 with potential to go higher. It is an intense sub-one hour experience that makes me feel like a dunce. There is so much game in so little time, I feel myself wanting to pull this out a lot at game nights. A good sign.

Update after 6 plays including a couple of two players, and another couple of four-players, this game is phenomenal. It starts out at controlled chaos and quickly is reduced to a delicate dance where you are constantly trying to ensure that your plans don't go astray - but they somehow always do. I think the partners version is really my favorite. The chaos is minimal, the teamwork is maximal.

4 plays (1x2p/2x3p/1x4p) - tremendous game kernel, maybe a hybrid in the best sense with El Grande & Liberte feeling elements plus province track like Maharaja's governors... Feel original and familiar both. The shorter length is another strong value that could lead to more play. Very tight game. Every decision is crucial, making it feel intense with AP potential. The shifting sands... I like the gambling sense to it a lot. Victory seems decided by only one cube or one timing decision. Cube counting during your turn doesn't take long, but leads to quiet play. I have to keep my big mouth shut. Playing 2 v. 2 teams has a different kind of fun factor, but mitigated by more silence.

RATING: 3
King of Siam is a simple majorities game with minor elements of Liberte mixed with El Grande. On the board, there are 3 colours of cubes, each representing a faction in Siam. There is also a series of chits on the left side of the board, Maharaja: Palastbrau style which shows the order in which the regions are going to be resolved. Areas, when resolved, leave behind a marker showing who won the area control contest: i.e.: if a single faction has a simple majority when it scores, they win the province. If there is a tie, then the British get to put a chit there.

All of the action is driven by a hand of cards that the players start with, all starting hands are identical, and the cards allow players to place fresh cubes onto the board, or move them around, El Grande/&c. style, to swing majorities. When you play a card, you do the action shown, and then you steal a cube of your choice from the board and place it in front of you. This is used to determine influence in each of the factions.  The end game scoring is where the Liberte comparison comes in, as the goal is to have the most influence in the faction that controls the most areas. If the British control 4 areas at the end of the game, then the winner is the player with the most sets of 3 in front of them. That is the game.

This plays quickly, and is decent, but it is too simplistic to really grab my attention. Though it has touches of some games that I really enjoy, the player choices are extremely restricted, and there is a lot of formulaic back and forth because of the identical hands that the players have. It plays quickly though, which is the only reason why I might be willing to play it again, but there are much better ways to spend 30 minutes.

First reaction: a bit (unpleasantly) surprised to see such a small box priced like a full-size game.

Third reaction: WOW! This has about the highest ration of interesting decisions to rules complexity of any game I can think of. Especially when played in teams, and adhering to the rule that teammates may not communicate.

This will sit proudly as my only 2v2 boardgame (although I'd be happy to try Dog if I could find it). The fact that it plays quickly, is dirt simple to teach, has zero luck after setup, are all bonuses.

RATING: 7
Even though I've played it on numerous occasions, I'm still not sure how I feel about this game, [i]exactly[/i]. It is a clever design, without doubt, and shows that there's still life left in the age-old mechanism of majority control. As with all good games, I'm slowly learning to 'see' the strategies and patterns, so no problems there, too. The most difficult part of the game is the beginning: you have no idea what to do and how to accomplish it. Just grab something, and see where it leads from there. All in all, a tight affair which has the players thinking surprisingly hard and long for such a small affair.

What I'm not sure about is whether or not the game is too complex for its own good. The tiebreaker rules are annoying to remember, but [i]must[/i] be remembered as finishes can (and are likely to) be close. The last card cannot be played unless you win with it-rule is also annoying, because it means that the game pace slows down considerably as players begin weighing and calculating their options to the last decimal. Finally, I'm not sure I like the team player option which supposedly makes this game playable for 4. Truth be told, I don't mind the team aspect much because I know that there is no hidden information: all players start out with exactly the same hand of cards so there is no need for complex 'signalling' or plain hoping that the partner has a good hand or whatever. Still, I've gritted my teeth over avoidable mistakes made by my partner on more than one occasion. Teams should be composed of equally experienced players, otherwise it isn't much fun. This relegates King of Siam to the 2- and 3-player gamepile. Where, as I predicted, it works much better simply because there is no need to wonder about what your teammate is going to do, too. I designated this game to be 'best of show' while at Spiel 2007, and I still think it ranks amongst the best I've played there. But there is now a little doubt whether I wasn't too enthusiastic at that moment. The game is still good, but those rules feel unnecessarily 'gamey' to me.

I've decided to settle on 7 for now, for the 3P-game; this is a good and tight affair causing many interesting decisions. 4P is between 5 and 6 unless the players are all experienced and know each other well—something which regrettably doesn't happen very often in my gaming groups.

This is a brilliant distillation of a meaty game into a small box and a small play time.  

So far I seem to be able to come up with a strategy and stick to it, although that could be because my opponents are living from move to move.  

If there's still scope for combined strategic and tactical play after we're all up to speed I'll most likely up the rating.

I've only played with 2 so far and am loving it, but I'm also very keen to try it with 3 and with 2 vs 2 - which might also up the rating as well.

An excellent little brain-burner.  It's pretty short but definitely not filler.  Setup is the only random element, and everything is perfect information.  Shares some elements with Carolus Magnus in that you have to balance cubes on the board for faction control of territories with cubes in hand for player control of factions (each player uses an identical hand of action cards to get new cubes into play).  Also in that it's set up as a 2- or 3-player game and 4 can play in partnerships.

RATING: 8
New sub-genre: Brain-Burning Filler. :)

Players attempt to grow their influence in any number of the three factions. Each player has only 8 action cards to play over the course of the game, can play any number of them in a turn, but there are only 8 turns. Playing an action allows the player to add or move cubes of different factions and then remove a cube from the board, thereby increasing their influence in that faction, with the side effect of potentially weakening that faction's chance of winning. This game is very clever and very thinky for a 30 minute game. It has a simple set of rules, but also plenty of interesting decisions. Watch out for analysis paralysis, though.

One of the best two player area control games.  Much better than Macht & Ohnmacht.  Simple, elegant rules - this is one of the more underrated games.

Played the 4er, 2-team game.  Strange game.  Hard to figure out what to play.  I think this one could increase in rating w/some more plays.  Strangely, it felt a little like bridge.  However, there are a few things I'm not sure I like about it.  The cube collecting feels very "one-up"..."oh you just tied me in yellow, let me get one more".  So it becomes difficult to overtake a leader in a color.  More plays may reveal this to not be a problem, but after one play I wonder how much variability the game will offer.

The best thing this one has going is the delicious partnership rules. How well do you telegraph your intentions to your partner, and do they take a cue to invest in the colors you intend?

This is undoubtedly a very clever game.  It seems to me to be a mashup between Carolus Magnus, Maharaja, and China.  The problem for me that I think I would rather play any of those other games over this one.  The only 8-actions bit makes the game very tight, and maybe too puzzle-y for my tastes.  The best part of this game is that it makes for an intense competition, but that is a fairly common trait of area majority games.  For 2, I would rather play Dynasties.

After the initiative cards are dealt, there is no luck in this game at all.  In this area majority only one faction will win, and you have to try and make sure that you have the most influence on that faction.  The trick is that by increasing your influence with a faction, you are removing their potential for the resolution of future conflicts.  It's also interesting that The British can end up colonizing which causes the end the game early and changes end game conditions.  This game is pretty quick and with 4 players you are playing 2 teams head-to-head.  Unfortunately the game feels dry compared to other area control games.

Stunningly simple game design, but lots of choices and a tight game to be had here. We played a partnership game and Paul totally screwed up my chance of winning. But I definitely want to play this as a three player game. The box has lots of theme and history, but the regions of Siam may just skew it a little. Perhaps an abstract map might have more balance in the end game, which for us played itself out for three rounds.*** Played as a three player and enjoyed it. It seems tricky to enter with a strategy. If you play your cards early, you have no control later in the game. I think you need to ally with one player, and let them do the work and then steal the lead.

Short, deep, fantastic game where players are distinct from the factions on the board. Every cube counts, and the mechanic of having to remove a cube on the board is genius!

Duration: Short, sharp, there is potential for AP, but the seeming chaos, ambiguous consequences, fixed hand, and immediate concern limits that. There's almost no bookkeeping and turns go by quickly.
Design: The core mechanic of manipulating factions and balancing board strength and personal influence is fantastic and innovative, and well-tied with action-management and resolution-order management. The tie-breaker and anti-kingmaker rules are a bit fiddly, but it's clear what they address. The illegal move rule is a bit fuzzy, and the anti-reversal move is annoying. Randomness is confined to the board setup.
Strategy: Plays have very clear immediate effects, but their longer term value is mysterious. I understand that some play with open information, so the entire game can be analysed; apparently the game holds up just as well.
Production: Simple and straightforward, some errata is included. I would like the illegal move rules to be expanded upon in the rulebook.
Theme: I really enjoy the theme and how it's played out in the major mechanics. What the cardplay corresponds to is however unknown.

The chaos and immediate region resolution makes it tactical, yet managing the factions, your supporters and your hand strategic.

July 2011 Update: At this point I'm very frustrated with how my strategy tends to fall apart in the final turns, and reading through the final plays matters more than colour control and the like.

What makes King of Siam so interesting is that the game is not about pushing for a certain outcome.  That game is about fighting  for advantage.  Creating situations where your opponent is forced to spend more cards than you gives you all the power.  Regardless of which way they go, you can always respond in kind until your final card gives you the flexibility to win over what they do.  Luckily the game gives you plenty of opportunities to turn the table on your opponents.  I would liken it to a wrestling match where the person on top has all the advantage and the game is about fighting back and forth for that advantage until someone is eventually pinned. So tense, so deep, and so fast.  That sounds a bit dirty after my wrestling comment, but what the hell, it's one of the most satisfying games I can play in 30min.   

2player is great if a little bit dry.  3 player can be as much about managing your opponents at the game so everyone has to be playing a pretty solid game lest they give it away.  4 player is becoming my favorite. The dynamics of the partnerships are so interesting adding just the right amount of uncertainty and extra layers to the tight 2 player structure.  Of course, this is even more reliant on all players being somewhat experienced lest your partner basically go out first when you called tichu.

Seemingly simple idea, deep game. It's so hard to read that  you may not find a strategy until a few cards have been played almost arbitrarily. I imagine if you can really assess the opening cube layout/province order you could make some astute plays, but I can't see that far ahead yet.

Every game I have played has turned out different, and the gameplay felt different each time as well. The first couple of power struggles are resolved without much action. The next few turns players have jockeyed for possition by playing cards. The last couple of power struggles are usually very thought provoking. Players tend to play cards that put pieces on the board so they can gain influence on strong factions. Most games are very close and come down to one of the tie breaking conditions.

RATING: 8
A delightfully different area control game. Eight Siamese provinces are to be divided between three factions (and the British who take over whenever there is a tie). Players can influence any of the factions, and the most influential player in the faction that wins the majority of provinces becomes King of Siam.

Each player only has 8 actions for the entire game which mostly add or move cubes around. After each action a player may collect a cube of any faction from anywhere on the board. This serves to strengthen his influence in that particular faction (most cubes of the dominant faction wins the game) but at the same time weakens the same faction on the board in its struggle to actually gain the majorities required for domination. The way to the crown is a real balancing act.

One game played, but thoroughly enjoyed. The strategy is very counterintuitive to other games as you try to orchestrate which faction is going to win on one hand and make sure you have enough of that faction to claim the win on the other. At the same time, you are trying to concel as best as possible, your true intent from the other players. In my (limited) experience, the game seems to cinsistantly come down to the tiebreakers to determine a winner. These are quite complex and it seems like the person who understands those tiebreakers the best has the best shot at winning the game.

Pfffff... What a game! It is the heaviest brain burner you can play in 30 minutes. It is unbelievable how much game there is in a deck of 8 cards. I've only played it with three and four players.

As a Thai, I'm naturally interested to try any game that has Thailand as the main country on the map :-) This game's premise sounds promising - back the winner in the fight to dominate Thailand between the Siamese, Laos, and Malays. In the even of tie, the control of that province goes to the British. Both goals and mechanics feel very faithful to history. Unfortunately they didn't gel into a solid gaming experience. We played twice and had no idea what kind of strategies to use; our actions seem easily cancelled or made moot by the next opponent. A pity as I really wanted to like this game.

Elegant tight take on an area-control game.  I can see the comparisons with Web of Power and El Grande, but this takes those ideas and compresses until they squeak.  You get a lot of game in a short time, just kick the AP players along.  And a bit of history as well on what could otherwise be an abstract - ie the theme sticks.

Solid little area control game.  I really like the idea of two different endgame conditions and the fact that this is all about backing the right faction rather than playing a faction yourself.  I enjoyed this more than China or Web of Power as there is a different set up for scoring each game and you have those darn British to concern yourself with at all times.  The overall look of the game is very clean and while nothing stands out really, I think it looks pretty nice.

2vs2 only (for us), 3 occasionally.

Alterations/House rules: Cards laid flat in the open, and then discarded as used; Cubes are pushed up to the edge of the board for an easy visual grasp.

Touchstones: A game of chicken as one holds cards to the very end; Maharacha card could come out early; Fuel an arms race?; Should I throw a signal to my partner by doing the obvious?; The first card played contains mountains of information for the rest of the table to decipher; it rarely helps your own cause directly.

Possibly the ugliest game I have ever played, but interesting gameplay.

I likely will never play the game again.  Since my last move couldn’t win me the game it wouldn’t let make a move. I find it horriably broken that I had to take last place when there were three different moves that would have gotten me second.  I think a player shouldn't be not allowed to make their best move and end in their best position.

Dense is the best way to describe this game. You only take 8 actions, but deciding when to take each one, and then what do with it, is tricky every time. The two layers of majority needed to win makes this game exceptionally difficult and interesting. Judging your timing in this game is agonising - you can't tell if it was too soon until someone else plays, but you always feels the pain when you play too late and have junk cards left in hand. The most game for the fewest components.

I deleted my original rating of '10' because I haven't been able to play the game in some time and to be honest my memory of it is fading in light of other games I have been into. Here, nonetheless, is the comment I wrote after playing: "You MUST try this excellent area control game. The rules are simple, but watchout: there is *profound* depth and very interesting dynamics. What is also amazing about it is that it plays in only 30 minutes, *and* it has a rich (though detail free) theme that is deeply integrated into the mechanics! It would definitely not surprise me if this game will wins a steady stream of followers and much long-term respect in the boardgame community."

A very rule-light area majority game.  Can one own too many of these? I sure do, yet the agonizing decisions, the short playing time (30 minutes except with AP prone players), and the intriguing 4 player game (I love 2 and 3 players too) make Siam a very nice game to have around.

RATING: 9
Few games make eight actions hurt as much as Konig von Siam. Aligning yourself and making win a particular faction is the name of the game, but every other player around the table's play is shaped by the same limitations -- and to make things more difficult, everything is in plain sight. Accordingly, this becomes a game of chicken in which players wait until the last minute to turn the game around (if it isn't too late already!) -- which is thematically linked to the time and place. More often than not, this game is one of THAI BREAKERS, and playful nonchalance. So much from so little.

This clever election game makes timing of the very limited actions to both strengthen and gain influence in the political factions of Siam the key in a focused and clever game, seemingly meant for 3 players.

A very nice effort, and one which will probably reward further plays.

If you can get past the dense rules, this is not a bad game. It is deceptively quick at less than 30 minutes, yet there are some interesting tactical choices in all of 8 turns. You only have 8 action cards, and are free to use them up as much as you want on a given turn. If you use them up early, then your opponents will get control in the later turns and you'll be helpless; it is an delicious dilemma that is posed to all the players. We've only played once, but agree that based on the mechanics that 3 players is the sweet spot. With 4 players, this has to be played in teams of two, which doesn't feel satisfying. This is a much meatier filler than No Thanks or For Sale.

I like the indirect area control play of the game. I was initially afraid that trying to figure out the ramifications of actions (which might not become entirely apparent for several turns) would be a recipe for agonising analysis paralysis (something I generally hate in games...I like to keep the action moving). Maybe this game is Too Hard To Analyse (for my group, at least) because that hasn't happened in my plays yet.

One downside is that it seems that players can get stuck in low probability positions relatively early on. By which I mean, about halfway through you realise that Red is the most likely to win and you have no hope of wresting control of Red away from Player A and Player B. Luckily the game plays quickly enough that a loss like that doesn't take the entire night.

Need to play more frequently or don't play at all - otherwise the strategies don't develop & the winner doesn't know how they did it.

I don't mind the partner game with 4 players but 3 players is probably my preferred number.  

[q="clearclaw"]... it is all about the tie-breakers.  The whole game is the cascade of tie-breakers, and thus the heart of the game falls neatly out from there: establish ties that end up resolving in your favour.  How to do this?  Present the other players with forks, decisions such that no matter what they choose, to act, to not act, to use any card, to take any cube, so that no matter what they choose they loose position, and do so in such a way that the forks form a string one after another and so the other players lurch from losing decision to losing decision.

Of course the other players are attempting to do the same to you, which can make things a mite tricky.[/q]

First played March 25th, 2008. Taught in 10min, played in 20min with 3 players. This has great luck/strategy balance. Perhaps more strategy. Each player starts out with 1 random player aide card and one 8 action card set. The player aide shows two starting followers(4th get same as left neighbor). The board has 8 province and 3 are initially influenced(home) by blue, red, and yellow(one of each). Each province gets 4 random followers to start with the exception of the 3 home get two of same color then two random. Eight matching province tiles are shuffled and placed on the board to show the order which battle for control will take place. Lowest #'ed player aid goes first and chooses one action card (of 8) or passes. Actions are(#of): place one of each color in a non controlled province; can be same or different(2), two of specified card color in a non controlled province adjacent a province controlled by that color or the home province(3), move specified # of cubes around on the board from/to non controlled province; could be same color; 2 for 1 has to be adjacent, 1 for 1 does not(2), change order of battle between two provinces and choose one that can't be further changed(1). Action cards played must be completed if possible(even partially). After playing an action, take 1 cube from the board. Play continues clockwise until all players pass, then control is determined by which color has more followers. If one has majority then a marker is placed on the capitol. If there is a tie, it goes to British Control. After control is determine the next territory fight begins. Game ends when British control 4 provinces, otherwise after all 8 provinces are controlled. The color with the most provinces rules, if a tie exist, then rule goes to the last province controlled in the tie. If British control, the winner is the player with the most sets(1 of each color). If a tie, then winner is the last to play an action card. Otherwise winner is the player with the most of the 1st ranked, then most of 2nd ranked for a tie, then first to use up his last action card played.

Nov08: Well, that was refreshingly different.  You have to walk a thin line of control versus just letting things ride.  Early cards take full effect, but the ramifications of late cards are more poignant.

I'm still split on owning it however.  I know others have said it, and I'll say it again: The tie breaks are annoying.  Why?  Because there are 30 of them.  Or at least it seems like it.  Why does the last card played win in some circumstances, but lose in others?  It shouldn't really bother me, but it does a little bit.

I might have to give this one another go to really make up my mind.

Stock-holding mixed with area control and hand-management. Short play time! No luck! Tiny box! Packs a lot of agony-per-minute and -per-cubic-inch. Rules changes make the 2, 3, and 4 player games unique experiences (the 4-player partnership mode has great potential). Would take 2 minutes to explain to a newbie if not for all of the tiebreakers (which are quite necessary).

Probably my favorite 2-player game. 3 is ok, but 2 and 4 are where it shines.

I once took a point off because I thought I enjoyed it less with less experienced players. After further experimentation, it turns out I don't.

This is a tough game, really, in a good way but it does cause some AP as the system is set-up to be countered balanced.  

You have only 8 turns and you are trying to collect a colour (there are 3) that you hope is going to win and in order to do this you have to remove one piece from the board which WEAKENS that colour, pretty brutal really and also kinda fresh in a very big batch of AC games.  Not much luck at all here but a little player induced chaos with the order track (similar to Maharaja) and how and when cards are played. A nice feature here is everyone shares the same 8 cards and gets to choose when to play them, even being able to choose to play 2 or 3 in one round which will cost you later but having the option is nice! I also love that when you pass your action, you can jump back in later and play another action as long as one other person also took an action, excellent design choice there. 

I'm pretty sure most games will be very close and come down to the last turn which keeps you on your toes the whole game. I didn't like how ties were broken as it seems a little anti-climatic and ties do look to be quite probable often however I'm not sure there is a better or more logical way to do it either. The British victory though (if 4 of the provinces tie the British win then whoever has the most sets of three colours wins) looks like it should be should be 3 provinces instead of 4 which would make it more doable and a more viable option, this would really up the tension I think kinda like Liberte in that way. 

A nice short and elegant area control game playable in about 30 to 45 minutes. I do think the partner game might be the best version of the game as it will really add an interesting element so I need to try this, that version could rate an 8 for me. 

[u]Update:[/u] 7 => 7.5 The partnership game rates an 8, a really excellent psychological battle as you try to figure out what the other team is doing but also what your own partner is doing! 

[u]Update:[/u] 7.5 => 7 Hmmm it seems the game is so counter-balanced that games really do come down to the last turn or so with good players. So while games are close and that sounds good, it seems like the whole game before the last turn is mostly a futile effort as the game just gets decided on the last turn anyway (as long as you were playing correctly and didnt fall behind). This applied to the last 2 four player games I played and I think one 3 player as well. Still a good game but this I think takes away from it for me and will kill some of the replay value as well(desire).  

=> traded

Really enjoyed it and was surprised. There doesn't appear to be much here, but it really was nicely done and had very good strategic play. Good production, good game--it is dry and an abstract, but that didn't stop me from being involved and in a very close game.

Eva, Jorge, and myself played at Geek Con 2008 and had a really good time with it.

I came in 2nd (it was most close) and the contest had great tension--honestly, I was surprised at the involvement.

I believe that I would buy this if the price wasn't so nasty. It's a good game.

RATING: 7
Single 4 player game, which worked well as a 2 vs. 2 partnership game, plus three 3 player games.

Nice, quick-playing area majority game. After 4 player game we agreed that it felt a little like a lighter, quicker Liberté in that you play to control the factions on the board and advance the one you think will win.

However, again a little like Liberté you need to know the various tiebreakers, understand when each applies, and how to manipulate them as the game often seems to end in a tie. Given there are only eight turns in KoS, the players each take only eight actions and start with the same resources, the high occurrence of a tied result is perhaps unsurprising.

A nice little game.  Packs a lot of strategic punch for a game with simple rules that plays in under an hour.  I don't like area control games much, but this one plays 2-player and 4-player (with teams) where all the kingmaker issues don't exist.  Even the 3-player version is pretty fun.

RATING: 7
Good majority game. I like how everyone's 8 actions can be used (or used up) at any time. I'd like to play the partnership version with 4 players. Partnership could be that little bit extra that pushes this game to an 8. My only complaint is that the "last card cannot be played unless it is the winning move" rule feels forced to mitigate a kingmaking problem with the game.

RATING: 4
After two 3 player sessions I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed. I traded for this because one of my geekbuddies referred to this as a better version of an overly-bloated Liberte. I liked Liberte and thought if this was a better, faster, more streamlined version of it than it would be worth a shot. Yet following our back-to-back 3 player sessions the game doesn't feel as exciting as Liberte nor does it feel as thematic. 

Our first game ended in a British Victory with 2 of the 3 players pushing for such an outcome. The winner was able to play their final card to ensure victory while all three of us had the same set of blocks.

Our second game 2 of the 3 players decided to hang back while the other player dominated with yellow early on. The other two players passed much of the game before pushing for red collectively; red ended up being the winning faction. This time the two red players were tied with the winner having a bit more yellow to win the game.

Overall, I think I appreciate the design more than the game itself. I don't like 2-1 strategy that the game clearly favors wherein 2 players push something that a third party is powerless to stop. I might enjoy it with 2 or 4 better, but for now the game gets a 6.

UPDATE: 12.11.11

Played a 2-player session with Nicole tonight which she won in a tie-breaker scenario at game's end. Nicole didn't like it much and felt frustrated throughout most of the game. I didn't like the tit-for-tat feel of the game and like the 3-player sessions, I feel as though I appreciate the game more than I enjoy it.

UPDATE: 1.11.12

Ultimately I'm a bit disappointed in this one. I know it is supposed to be a stripped-down version of Liberte with all the good stuff left in but the game just feels soul-less to me. I don't feel the theme and with everyone having the exact same set of cards the game quickly falls into a tit-for-tat affair. Sorry, but I prefer Wallace's bloated, theme-rich Liberte warts and all.

RATING: 8.5
In essence this is a very short (30 minutes) yet meaty area control game. The theme is refreshingly original (although it's relatively abstracted), and the production and art are nicely done. It's one of those games that just really clicks with me. Games that it felt similar to in various ways, all of which I happen to also like: El Grande, Imperial, and, (to a lesser extent) Hansa Teutonica.

I like how everyone influences the three factions rather than each player "owning" a different faction.  The closed cube economy makes for interesting dynamics between investing in a faction while causing that faction to become weaker.  Thus the game has an arc as it progresses, where as you increase your investments/points, it becomes harder and harder to invest and/or strengthen the very color you're invested in, due to a shrinking "cube pool".

Scales well from 2 to 4 players and feels very different at these different players, which bodes well for replayability.

This game fills a nice niche: 30 minute thinky spatial/area control that scales really well from 2-4 players. This game has been out for 3 years, but until someone recommended it to me on a thread a few months back, it hadn't been on my radar at all. Definitely one of my biggest pleasant surprises of the year!

Update after 8 plays:
Downgraded from 9.2 to 8.5.  Because it's no luck perfect information, it loses a bit in the arena of replayability.  I still like it, just not as enthusiastic about it as I once was...  But, it's still a really fun game.  I love how the historical theme inspires and was integrated into the game design - read the designer's notes!

King of Siam might be too subtle for its own good, i.e. most players won't enjoy the game as the available actions seem to be pointless cube pushing. The relation between actions changing the majorities on the board, investments by taking one factions cube from the board, province scoring and victory conditions is so opaque that actively influencing the game into your direction becomes a doubtful exercise at times. It needs experienced players to levy the potential of KoS. Otherwise, the result can be very random without any random element in the game.

On first play (two-player game), both of us ended up with the same set of cubes.  We forgot that the last card can't be played unless it'll win the game.


  I "won" because the other player played her last card.   If she hadn't played it, we think I would have won anyway.


Will try again.

RATING: 8
A quick playing game that is only lengthened by the agonizing decisions one must make. You must try to plan multiple moves ahead, but at the same time you need to remain very flexible to pounce on any advantage you can. There are only 8 total actions to play for the entire game, which can be spent all at once during one of the 8 turns or spread out. You also need to mentally keep track of what actions your opponents have played as well. A terrific game I look forward to playing again.

Best part is the cards. You get 8 (iirc) but they never return to your hand after being played. So you want to keep your best cards for last. But what if your last couple of cards just... don't really work all that well anymore in this situation? xD

Only played twice, but I love the decisions it gives you.  Simple rules, no luck, but complex enough that it doesn't feel like a dry excercise in figuring out what your opponents' perfect moves are going to be.  Indirect victory condition, like 'Triumvirate':  one of the factions wins, usually; then the winning player is the one with the most control of that faction.

A really cool quick cube-pusher that despite being very abstract still feels somehow connected to the theme. Low luck, I especially like the way you need to get a lot going your way with very few actions allowed and the lookahead needed to play them right. A bit of brain burn and AP isn't too bad here, it's quick enough anyway.

I need to play more to see if some player count is optimal, but the 2-player game was good. I suspect it's different but no worse with 3 or as the 2 vs. 2 team game. The team game needs repeated plays with an experienced group to really shine, I doubt it will get that on my shelf.

Horrible, pure abstract euro game what does not make sense at all. So it's very unintuitive. 

It's an area of majority game where you manipulate cube movement and you pickup cubes that you are going to use as a shareholding that color. 

I thought that the player with the most of a color scored the amount of territories controlled by that color. So I tried taking majority in 2 different colors. But no, only 1 color would win. So I should be able to guess from the start which color was going to win (1/3 chance) and stick only with that color to make sure it does not get stolen. That was what the player did, he had more than 8 cubes in a color making in impossible to control. 

So it's just a plain boring abstract game where you are moving cubes for no reason and then at the end of the game, somebody wins for no good reason either. I don't see how you could enjoy playing this.

I was disappointed in the play of this very short game.  Reminds me of a very abbreviated Liberte (which I enjoy) in scoring.  Each player will only have 8 actions maximum in this game which everyone else also has available.  Its very difficult to make plans to win in this game as you basically decide whether you will play a card and take the action or pass in the course of voting in 7 regions (assuming the English do not take over 4 provinces first).

This is a fine little abstract game, very intelligent design. So far, I have only played it 2 players, but as such it is very good.

RATING: 8
A tight area control brain burner with only eight decisions for each player to make over the course of the game. Oh! How delicious are those decisions, though. For example, gaining support of one of the three factions in the game comes at the expense of weakening that faction's overall presence on the board. Therefore, feints and subtle plays become as important as bold, overt gestures. Strategies will quickly collide as players interrupt one another's plans while working towards one of two possible end game states.

About time I gave this game a comment.

I've had this in my collection since early 2010 and it still sees regular play (at least once a month or so). 2-player, 3-player or 4-player... this game just shines. So much active involvement in a game, easy to explain rules (except for the necessary but somewhat counter-intuitive tie-breakers), action management, economy (of a sort); for a 20-30 minute experience there is NOTHING else that even comes close, IMO. Easily one of my favorite games of all-time.

This is a fantastic game to start a games night, but not one that I'd end on since it's deceptively tough on a brain already taxed with exhaustion. Needs to be back in print.

You know how when one of your gums is sore you can't resist poking at it, because even though it's hurty it kind of feels good at the same time?  King of Siam is like that.

The theme is surprisingly well-integrated for such an abstract-seeming game.  The components are very attractive.

Plays well with 2, 3 or 4.

RATING: 9
Astonishing. Intense game, in which you have eight actions to gain majority for a faction in eight areas, while gaining control of the faction at the same time which weakens its position on the board in exchange. Or you could screw with your opponents, and weasel the English in. Good luck with that, though. Because of the limited actions, you have to play your opponents, you have to watch your timing and have to be able to change course if necessary. On top of all this, while each mode differs from the other, plays equally well with 2, 3 or 4 players, and very accessible to kids over 8 or newbies, while it remains just as tense and exciting as with battle hardened pros.

Initial rating after 2 plays with 2: Neat majority game, set in Thailand. Mechanics are different than most area control games. Feels like a hard one to master. "Deep" for such a short game.

NL: Mooi uitgevoerd relatief klein en kort strategisch spel zonder geluksfactor. Je probeert je invloed te vergroten in de partij die uiteindelijk Thailand het meest gaat overheersen. Verassend strategisch voor zo'n kort bordspel.

RATING: 5
I liked this one okay, and I think many of the mechanics are quite interesting. I appreciate the strategic tension of needing to place cubes in position to control areas but also needing to remove those same cubes from the board in order to collect colors or sets. The concept is simple enough that I was able to do some planning after just a couple turns of my first play, but deep enough that it sustained interest.

Ultimately, this isn't a game I would ask to play. It still feels pretty abstract and not immersive enough for my tastes (it is just cube shuffling, area control and hand management). However, I would probably play it occasionally if asked, and it seems to me that (at least based on my admittedly limited Euro knowledge) it has some good and innovative ideas.

I don't use decimal points in my ratings, but this one would probably be 5.?, I suppose, to slightly distinguish it from the typical Euros which are in the 4-5 point rating range.

I suspect that, [i]for me[/i], this is close to as good as it gets in a standard Euro. That's not exactly a glowing recommendation, but it is what it is.

RATING: 4.5
Uninspired abstract.  Took an interesting theme and squeezed all the life out of it.  Played with two which at least gave one the feeling of some control: cannot imagine playing with any more as I would feel totally detatched with any more.  Each of us made some clever little plays with the cards, but once you've made your clever plays, won't they just be used over and over from game to game?  What is the point?  Only eight actions so cramps your ability to play creatively, we can only repeat our clever acts so many times before they get damn boring.  At least the iconography of the cards made playing easy, not that I will ever have any desire to do so again.

An excellent game of very subtle balances--the changing victory conditions and nuances of tie breaking are fascinating. However, British victory seems unlikely. Extremely close games the norm. Pronounced learning curve; quite difficult to know what to do at first, even given the slightly asymmetric starting point. [9 plays]

RATING: 4
Basically, you say "pass" repeatedly until you are forced to make a move at least halfway through the game. I suspect this is not how the designer anticipated this game would be played. It feels less like a game than a puzzle that shifts ever so slightly until one player realizes he can solve it and makes the winning move.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Excelent are control game with a twist mechanic that makes the winning condition harder to achieve because you have to take off cubes of the color you want to win from the board, and that is against the nature of a area control... GREAT!

Through sheer good luck I have found a coven of gamers at work and at least two or three times a week we'll get together at lunchtime and play a variety of quick and simple games in one of the break rooms. Usual favourites are Parade, Coloretto or Quoridor.

One of the chaps suggested that when there are but two of us we could try König von Siam as it was supposed to have a bit of depth but be quick to play.

Well, after a few plays I must say it's got a lot of depth and a lot of replayability. The game is really well designed with great production values and offers difficult choices every turn - even the decision to 'pass' can be of great significance.

A great little game that plays quickly and has huge depth. Well worth a try.

What appears a simple game turns into a real brain burner as you try to work out which powers will dominate which provinces. This also has the self-attacking mechanic where by taking more of a colour you think is going to win to improve your stock in that power has the effect of reducing that colour on the board (and hence its ability to dominate!).
The game play is quick and yet involves some really difficult decisions.
A Good short game that will appeal to gaming groups!

A game of manipulating majority of different areas for your benefit. Like chess, everyone has a fixed set of cards and fixed turns, you only choose when to pass, when to play cubes and what cubes to take. The rules are simple but leaves a lot of rooms for creative play. The theme is non existing and while there is tension among players, it feels kind of flat. You also have less sense of control compared with other abstracts for a three players game (which is the ideal number)

King of Siam is a really interesting and unusual game to play.  The limited actions and limited turns makes for a very interesting dynamic, where players are both encouraged to play their cards, and encouraged to hold onto them.  The game has a lot of think to it, as the only random elements are the initial cube layout and the order the provinces will resolve.  It can be a jarring game to play, because it is so unlike most other games you play.  Still, it packs a lot of strategy into a very short play time.

I am still a little unsure about King of Siam, but it is unusual and fun, and my group really likes it.  This is definitely a game that, if it were longer, would outstay its welcome.  As it is, it seems to be exactly the right length, and is a great dense, short game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In this 2-4 player game, there are 8 provinces in Siam that are being contested. Players play cubes (red, blue or yellow) onto the board to affect the area control. Players have an identical 8 card hand. When they play a card, players take a cube anywhere on the board to add to their collection. Whoever has the majority of cubes representing the majority in provinces, wins. In a 4 player game, it is a team game.

The team game isn't quite as fun as a 3 player game, and it seemed a bit artificial that a partner could ride the coat tails of the winner. The 3 player game is pretty good, with lots of tension, and back and forth between the players. I haven't played with 2 players, it might be slightly easier to have more sense of control then. It's an okay game, and plays quickly at 45 minutes.

Given that it is a pure area control game, with minimalist rules and a very short playing time, it offers much variety, tense game play and a lot of strategical possibilities. 

Not the perfect game for me (the winning strategy that one has to apply seems to me more like betting on a horse than positional strategy), but a game I will play over and over when I have little time.

Good in 3 players, but surprisingly also very good with 4 players (the game is played in two teams in the latter case).

You may consider adding it to your collection if you like area control games and minimalist design.

It's strange that in Siam you can play Lao and Malay factions (well you don't run them but...).  Also, it was the British and the French that attempted to manipulate the kingdom, not the British alone.  If you discuss it in the historical part of the rules, why not put it in the game?

rating based on one 3 player game where I put down my last card (the 23rd put down overall of the 24) and I coud not win, but had the option of deciding the winner. not a good thing in my book. the rules prevent this for the 24th card, but not for the 23rd. otherwise the idea is clever, and would not mind trying the partnership game. AP type players will ruin this otherwise short filler-like game.

Gioco molto strategico e tattico, poche regole ma molta profondità.

Il gioco non è esente da possibile kingmaking ma la durata contenuta rendono anche questo aspetto accettabile.

After a couple of games (4 player) I'm pleasantly impressed; it's a game that encourages further play, if only to determine what makes it tick .  There appear to be a number of strategies that can be adopted to achieve a victory, although the final result can appear to have had little to do with the initial (or for that matter, amended) plans of the players.  Further exploration needed.

RATING: 8
Played for the first time as a 2p game. Loved it. At first blush, this appears to be almost TOO stripped down a game - it's area majority distilled down to its essence. Further reflection reveals this game to be more akin to a fine cognac - it might be a distillation, but it's an oh-so-tasty one that is meant to be savoured. The limited actions force constant evaluation of your position: Do you commit a precious card now or play chicken with your opponent? Do you give the perception of working together or do you head in an opposite direction right away? Do you make a play for one faction early or hedge your bets? In short, an impressive number of considerations must be taken into account each turn, and the meager supply of action cards force you to be very careful with each and every decision.

Update: Have played several times more since then, including 3 and 4 player.  I still feel the same way - this is a great game.

Very intriguing and original design. Easy rules, hard to play. The kind of difficult reminds me of St. Petersburg - I mean, newbies look at the board, see the possible moves yet don't have a clue about what to do and why.

RATING: 7
It's a game of tit for tat in an attempt to eke out an edge at the point that the other team are willing to let go. Which makes for a tense battle and brinkmanship. The possible switches in winning conditions make life uneasy, and with only 8 actions, timing is all important and the game tense. It's just pushing cubes around El Grande style, but the partnership rules make for an interesting mind-reading exercise, trying to set your partner up for the win if only he'd realise it and do this! Knowing when to save your firepower seems to be key. Lots to like for an essentially abstract area majorities affair.

You only get 8 moves during the whole game and must manage these throughout the eight rounds in which a location is scored. The location will become controlled by either the red, yellow or blue cubes or end in a tie. Your goal is to move the cubes around in order to collect the most cubes of the type that wins the most regions. Not must to it, but indeed there can be a lot of thought as you never get your cards back and have to manage them as well as collect cubes. Quite an interesting game.

I love games where the strategy is much more complex than the rules, and after a couple of plays this definitely seems to be one of them. Each player only gets 8 actions in the entire game (though it does only last 30-45 mins), so they have to be chosen very carefully. The interesting thing is that the cubes on the board don't represent players, but independent factions, and by increasing your personal influence over a faction you reduce its power on the board. There's something almost Zen about it all, and I'm really looking forward to trying it again, though it will have to be with a well-chosen group of players.

May 2014: Upgrade from 5 (April 2010) to 7. Area majority game in which every move feels significant because the difference between first and second place is usually only one cube or territory.

My only issue with this one is it's not a game that I would like to play on a frequent basis. The game itself is short, but the turns are not; I usually have to be in the mood to play games where the atmosphere is mostly pensive silence. However, I don't like the rule that you can only see the last card your opponents have played! Changing that would probably increase the downtime!

Strategically, feels a bit like Knizia's Samurai, as you have to secure several majorities in order to win.

King of Siam is a tricky little beast.  It's almost more about gaming the other players than it is about playing the board.  It's a game of deception, trickery and thinking fast.  The fact that each player can only take eight actions in a whole game was what intrigued me and led me to purchase King of Siam, and I have not been disappointed.  The urge to play cards, to have an impact, sometimes outweighs my own sense of what would be a good move.  Very interesting, very frustrating and very clever.

The random set-up is important to the fun and replayability. A lot hinges on reading this right and then on mis-directing your opponents. The Mexican stand-off on playing cards is very interesting.  I like the partnership game - trying to get consensus on where the team is going is interesting. The three player game seems more prone to inadvertent collusion.

I enjoy the team play with 4 players, but no communication.  Strategy was surprisingly subtle compared to my expectations, and yet it doesn't take a long time.  It felt like we were going to be crushed, but then came back and took over the influence we needed to win.

This game seems very cool: a Euro-feeling game with various actions and nontrivial scoring of 3 colored points, but pure strategy with no chance except the random map setup.

--Feb2008-- Fascinating little indirect area majority game.  I really enjoyed my first play (despite coming last) and would love to play it again.  Despite only playing eight cards over the course of the game, there's a great deal of subtlety involved in those plays; the various cards have distinctly different time windows in which they are maximally effective - and those time windows are moved by the player actions.  It's a great system.

The only downside: the physical object of the game isn't that impressive.  In the copy that we used, the cards were unexceptional, the board rather crudely cut, the rules a couple of sheets of paper.  The game deserves something prettier.

Strange? Unpredictible?
Anyway: somehow this game is a short brain teaser - especially for three players. And because of the randomness of the tiles it should be different again and again. I think I've to rethink my rating after more plays.
Definitely there's not half of the flesh of its big Histogame brother and sister.

EDIT: I rethought my rating and let it fall down from 7.2 to 6.9 ... It's not my cup of tea, strategy is almost impossible.

Abstract playing chicken thinking game where you're looking for narrow victories, leading opponents on the wrong path and where understanding the tie breaker rules is vital. It's a close run affair that plays quickly. You've got to pick your battles and play your cards right. Of course. Probably best with a third player to create uncertainty, or in teams. Ultimately it feels a bit too dry to me as a two player. Not enough theme comes through and I'm just concentrating on those tie breaker rules.

RATING: N/A
It seemed very abstract, with the most pasted on of themes, yet, unusually for a Euro of this type, the rules had designer notes which went some way to explaining the theme. Brain mangling decision making in play. The game is about area control, with just 3 factions, but victory relies upon you having the control (the most cubes) of the winning faction. Cubes are limited, so the more cubes laid to establish area control, the less there are for you to collect to establish faction control. Each player has only the same 8 cards (actions) to play in the whole game, as each of the 8 areas is decided in turn, which results in agonizing choices around saving your cards till later or establishing advantage now. 

A masterpiece of design elegance and simplicity combined with brain burning decisions. Excellent game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Bet on which of 3 factions will win in the end. But the more you raise your stake on a faction, the weaker the faction becomes on the board. The erosion is very incremental, and it's difficult at times to see how each cube removed from the board gradually adds up. Hence, you want to raise your stake late, but your actions become weaker as more cubes dry up and options dwindle.

Lots of things to consider, and each turn in a game provides a unique puzzle to emphasize different things. Cubes in supply, the battle in the next region to resolve (and the next, and so on), the possibility of a switcheroo, other players' remaining actions, each player's holdings, the utility of each action card, and so on.

One of the few games which you can play in an hour and feel full afterward. There are a ton of options and directions with each move, and it always seems like you could "break" the game, but it doesn't; it just provides another situation. My only gripe is that the early game feels like a motley of fools bumbling around aimlessly and trying to remain flexible, and after the random collision of personal agendas, the game only takes on a clearer direction and becomes more interesting later on.

Only played the 4-player partnership game. I like the idea, since any majority game with over 3 players threatens to become a series of private, protracted battles. The teamwork element keeps each battle tight and involves all players in a clever way. It works (unlike other team games that are team by name only, since one player can play perfectly for both) because there are so many options that it's hard to get on a united front with your partner (and it's gratifying when you actually do feel like you're coordinating with your partner). There's also an interesting tension between going for the win and supporting your teammate for it.

This game just feels as though the designer has understood and mastered all the intricacies of a majority game.

Still need to try 2-player and 3-player.

Quite a change from the detailed and involved Friedrich. This one is pure eurogame. Players have a fixed set of 8 cards which they use to move cubes around the board in a bid to jostle for clear majorities. This has been done in games such as San Marco etc. 

I like that you can play as a partnership. We'll see how this one plays out. Definitely not as innovative as Friedrich. But you can't win them all.

Update:
A knife fight in a phone booth. Here’s an area-control game with some differences: players have asymmetrical actions and the game is designed to play within 30 minutes. Theme: Siam is having a civil war. Players have 8 actions to influence one of three warring factions. Each turn, a region is resolved and a majority of  cubes give the region to the winning faction. A tie gives the region to the British (which in turn alters final VP conditions).

The engine is driven by play of ‘El Grande’ style action cards. Place cubes, move cube, switch order of region reolving etc. Play of an action card also allows players to pick up one action cube. If a player has majority in the winning faction’s colour, they win. However, the agony lies in the fact that taking a cube from a faction also weakens it in future majority conflicts. A 4 player partnership game is also very intriguing.

However, one downside is that the first few turns (and cubes to take) are really stabs in the dark. One hopes that a cube taken will happen to belong to the winning faction. Thankfully, the short game length will help ease the pain of poor early choices.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I would never expect so much brainburning put in such a small box. It is quite difficult to develop a decent strategy, actually it is so hard to control what is happening on the board that you should try before you buy- it turns many people off.

Me, I do not regret buying it at all- I only hope I can find people who will appreciate it.

UPDATE> Ι don't think it will ever see the table again so I'm selling it.

It is a strange little stock game were only one stock pays to the player that has the majority.  

While technically you become King of Siam if you win the game, and yes it is played on a map and uses real historical factions.  Ultimately this is a dry abstract game.  Ameritrashers complaining about "cube confusion" will be choking on 'em here.

I feel that this is the kind of game that you try to move some stuff around and at the end you see what happened.  The ending was for me remarkably anti-climactic.

It is a real missed opportunity that, despite taking the passing system from 1853, there is no inclusion of an elephant to indicate who the priority player is.  In addition to being thematically cool, it also just makes things confusing without some marker.

An interesting game of pushing cubes around trying to gain control of majorities, sort of like Liberte with all theme removed. Plays pretty quickly, but it feels chaotic and the last-card-played-rule is REALLY annoying.

The board shows a map of Thailand divided into 8 regions, 3 of which are home territories (red, blue, yellow). Home regions get 2 cubes of their color, and 2 random ones; every other gets 4 random cubes. Region tiles are arranged in random order, setting the order in which regions will be resolved. Players get a set of action cards, and 2 starting cubes (shown on their start card, which also specifies starting player). On your turn, either PASS (may later play a card if your turn again), or play a card and take a cube from the board. The round ends when all players pass in a row: resolve the current region.Resolving a regions: if a color has majority, they win -- place control marker there. If not, the British take over. Either way, return cubes to supply area. Game ends immediately if Brits control 4 regions; otherwise, play all 8 rounds/regions.

The cards: 3 x place 2 cubes of a color in regions adjacent to a province that color won (home provinces count unless different color won). 2 x place a cube of each color into any province(s). 2x1: exchange cubes in adjacent provinces, 2 for 1. 1x1:  exchange 2 cubes in any 2 provinces. Maharaja: exchange 2 Region tiles (changing order regions will resolve); also place token on one of them -- it can no longer be moved.

Fiddly rule: the last card of the GAME may not be played unless it helps the player win.

A very interesting area control game that gives everyone the same 8 abilities that can each be used once.

RATING: 7
[Histogame 07 edition] {Siam; area-control, action-card, team-play; optimal 3p} King of Siam is a nice stock game, rather than an area control game.  Players have to collect the most followers of the winning factor in order to win the game.  It's fast, meaty and tactical.  The theme is thin; it's basically an abstract game.

There is intense player interaction.  Players have to react tactfully for the opponents' actions.  The limitation of 8 action cards is challenging, which forces players to think carefully before using a card.  In making a decision, players have to consider the limitation of followers (both in total and in supply) because it would directly affect whether a faction wins a province or not. And, due to this limitation, the game grows tenser when fewer and fewer followers are available.  The card playing mechanic is clever: players have to decide whether to stay and watch what happens, or take initiative to act.  A typical game is around 20-30 minutes.  This makes King of Siam a very good meaty filler.

The production quality is good for a small publisher.  The tiles are colorful and sturdy.  The illustration of the card is effect, though it's easy to forget the special 2vs1 function card.

Slightly unusual card driven area control game. The basic principle, whereby players compete to place or remove cubes of one of three colours from regions on the board, is one that has been seen numerous times before. Where the game differs is that each player has a matching hand of cards, each allowing a certain action (mostly variants of placing cubes of a particular colour in a specific type of region), and once these cards have been played they are out of the game. Therefore choosing the optimum moment to play a certain card is the main strategic decision in this game. The scoring is always tight at the end of the game but overall, after a few plays, you've seen pretty much all 'KoS' has to offer.

A puzzling and complicated game. I really liked a lot of this, but it is just a bit too fiddly to really be fun and make me want to play it again and again.

Update: Over time, my ratings have gotten harsher, whilst my understanding of games seems to have improved. As a consequence, my rating for the game is about the same, but I can now grasp what to do much better. This basically boils down to a case of how long can I hold off taking actions (and collecting cubes) to give me the most choice in what sets to collect vs. how many regions can I let resolve before I get involved?

That's an interesting decision, but I'm still not quite in love with the game.

Further update: I'm still not *in love* with this game, but I am kind of in love with what Peer Sylvester has managed to create from so few moving parts. It is an exceptional piece of design, even if the end game often leaves everyone co-operating to try and work out whether a player can win.

This has potential to be very special. The delicate balance of having to reduce influence of each faction as you commit to it is fantastic. Initial set up provides variety and after this the game is based on perfect information and each player has exactly the same resources available. Decisions were tense and interesting without being incredibly weighty, no huge downtime and analysis paralysis. This was the two-player game and it fills a great spot as "medium" weight game.

I dislike partnership games because I'm hopeless in reading what my partner requires. King of Siam is strange because it discourages 'table-talk', meaning that my partner can't even hint on what he/she needs! 

By the end of my first game, I realised too late that the key to this game is that you'll collect only 10 cubes throughout the game - you have to decide early on on which cubes you want to collect. If you want to maximise on Blue, collect 7+ blues, and so on. I suppose the only reason why you might want to diversify is if the British win, but that seems quite unlikely according to what I saw.

2 plays, 2 player.  I think the game is outstanding, if a bit dry, and very hard to pick up at first.  After 4-5 games though, I believe it will earn its keep.  

Thoughts:  Tremendous artwork, tough restrictions to work with (only 8 max actions), and welcome footprint--it takes up so little space.  Good test of gaming focus, as it takes so little time to play, and seems like it is wisest to figure out how to get the other player to burn actions when they don't want to.

I bought this because I had read it was Liberte-light, a good brain-burner that plays quickly and scaled well from 2-4 players.

It does not really come close to scratching my Liberte itch, but it is a good brain-burner that plays quite quickly.

I have only played it with 2 and 3 players, but playing partners with 4 sounds fun.

Rating is 7 so far, but my gut tells me this will go to up with more play.

Update: My rating has gone up to 8.5.  I am loving it with two and the portability is a plus.

Update:  Rating back to 7.  I don't know how I feel about this game but it is not "fun" with only two.  I need to play with 3 or 4 to know better.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3

A very interesting game and very fast which is unexpected for this type of game. I felt like it should be longer but that would really hurt the game in all honesty. Not that short is bad just saying this depth of thought usually is experienced in longer games. I'm not currently sure about the tie breaks though just seems like the game doesn't really accomplish what it's wanting to if more times than not win is resolved by tie break.

Very interesting combination of mechanisms. The general object is to gain more influence than your opponents over the strongest of three factions on the board, but that influence is only gain by reducing the faction's strength on the board. A bit of a brain-burner, but the mechanisms force the game to a finite length. I need to give this more plays to rate accurately.

Simple and intriguing game. You want to play again and again. It is a gem but for people that they like kind of abstract games (although the theme here fits very well). Give it a try, it will surprise you!

RATING: 5
DIY version... Abstract commodity speculation game with pretty opaque strategy. I hesitate to call it simple because it feels overwrought for the quality of decisions I feel like I'm getting for my effort. Too many options to consider at one time. Too high likelihood that a given move doesn't really matter. I don't know if this kind of thing is inherent to the stock-holding genre, but it feels loose (at least until the end of the game): the questions asked of the player need sharpening somehow.

Only played 3-player. It can be played 2p or 4p with partnerships but I'm not interested in that.

There is something interesting here to be sure. You have a limited number of cards you can play to affect the eight provincial contests. The essential concept of the game is that you use your cards to advance the dominance of one of the three factions, while also increasing your investment in the factions that seem most promising, because the largest shareholder in the strongest faction wins the game. Whenever you play a card, you can also take a "stock" of a color of your choice. So, it seemed to me that an obvious strategy is to hold on to the cards until near the end of the game when it's clear which faction is going to win. The player doing this did win (not by a landslide), but there is an interesting trade-off, in that many action cards draw cubes from from the supply, and the supply is limited. This means the longer you hold on to a card, the more likely it will have reduced or no effect once you get around to using it.

Simple and streamlined, this game is a thing of beauty and elegance. Only a very limited set of actions during the game makes it both short and tight. One of the few area dominance games I thoroughly enjoy.

A difficult, unique game. After a random setup, it's all strategy and psychology. The more influence you have for a faction, the worse that faction will do in the future. Great balance, and doesn't feel quite like any other game I've played.

Just a lovely little brain burner.

The designer taught school in Thailand and, while living there, learned how Siam avoided colonization by the British & French in the 19th Century; a successful tightrope walked by a number of factions struggling for control when the King initiated modernizing reforms. yet they didn't fall into the chaos of civil war, which would've prompted the British to walk in and establish order to protect their, erm, "interests." So, neat designer notes.

I played this once, and I'm not sure how much control I actually had in the game.  I'd like to play again, just to see how much tactics there are.

Having played a second time, I see that the game has some good tactical depth, but I don't see any strategic depth yet.  Still, it's interesting enough to keep playing.

RATING: 6.5
Played three times with two players and liked it. I am convinced that the game gets better as players get more familiar with it. This is mainly because it is hard to fully grasp the rules (especially the winning conditions and tie-breakers), even though there are not that many rules to learn. It also helps to fully understand the cards, as it is possible to wait too long before executing certain actions. Second game was already a whole lot more enjoyable than the first. Good deal of suspense for such a short game. Looking forward to playing with three!

RATING: 9
An almost-masterpiece by Peer Sylvester. Counter-intuitive, brain-burning strategy with a unique mechanic: You try to strengthen your influence over the seemingly-winning faction (acquiring cubes of that color) but in doing so you must inevitably weaken that faction on the board - thus hurting the chances of that very faction. Marvellous.

Half way through my first game of this, I declared it one of the best games I had ever played. The amount of game that is packed into 8 cards and 30 minutes is incredible. 

Definitely the best "filler" game I've played so far, and something that sets the benchmark. It's games like these that I'm searching for, and the ones that deserve to be in my collection.

There's so much beauty inherent in the design, I always get this feeling of wanting to affect change, to make a move, and ultimately regretting it when I make a move too far. I never seem to regret not making a move though; I need more patience.

29/06/14 - Played the partnership version and this game was fantastic! This game just gets better and better. It's amazing how the limited actions can confound new players, but after the first game it just clicks. The partnership version is really interesting, and the ability to not only monitor your opponents but pay attention to your partner and their signalling makes this an absolute delight. My partner was new to this game, and they followed my lead perfectly; I began by trying to force a single colour, trapping the opponent's team into over committing before my partner made a push for a different colour. It was poetry in motion.

I can't recommend this game enough. 

4 player is far and away the best way to play this game.

Lots of brain burn, and a significant amount of chaos.  It's tight, and it makes a great three-player game.  Love the alternating victory conditions.  Theme is cool, though the connection to the mechanics is pretty tenuous.  With this following the success of [gameid=12891] and [gameid=40354], [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/1629/histogame]Histogame[/url] is establishing themselves as a must-play.  Although they're not my favorite games ever, they're always novel, fascinating, unique, and very dense.

The 4p partnership game is sublime; 2p is pretty good too. King of Siam squeezes wonderful depth and angst from just a few moving parts and simple map, all in a 30 minute time frame - gah, what an achievement in game design.

There's a lot going on in this quick game. Everyone gets just 8 turns to affect the board. And with different victory conditions depending on whether the Siamese or the British dominate the map, it's a delightful game. I have a lot of work to do if I ever want to be consistently competitive in it. I think it's best with 3 players.

King of Siam is a brain burning strategy game offering amazing amount of strategic depth for such a quick playing game (~half an hour). The very limited number of cards, provinces, and followers involved doesn't leave much space to operate. Even the tiny board contributes to the claustrophobic tension. Influence on the game is subtle and only in nudges, not very much control at all. Highly abstracted politics that feels very, very slippery. Scoring is tight and often requires more than one tie breaker. The game varies greatly with the number of players (2-4) and my preference is the three player game. The four player game is 2v2 sans direct communication between partners.

RATING: 8
A unique quick game that needs to be played several times to "get it." It has a unique feel -- you're trying to get control of the winning faction, but you weaken your chosen faction's position by selecting them.

I played it with Mark and Vince at Great Hall Games.

After 2 games @ 4 players and 2 plays @ 3 players.

Awesome game. Small, easy, not too long, with (sometimes) extremely contriving. You have to careful watch each element of the game - regions, cards, cubes and so on. Emotions to the last (or almost last) turn.

I was laughing that is another game about moving coloured cubes around the board, but this game has "it".

After year break another play for 3 players - I've won by letting British make Siam their colony :D

I like to support small publishers - especially when their bits are classy - but there's not a lot here to distinguish it from others of its type.

Rating from two one-line plays, so it probably is not a completely fair shake. The game seems complex and deep, but weirdly arbitrary. I'm not a huge fan of area majority games, and get the same feeling from others (such as San Marco and Web of Power).

Overall, I'd be willing to try it again in person, but it's OK if I don't, also.

The first play of this game was quite interesting.  Neither my wife nor I knew exactly what we were doing.  By the third or fourth contest we were figuring it out.  She ultimately won on the last move, cornering the yellow and blue factions in a way that she could win no matter what.  She did comment multiple times that she now wants to watch "The King and I."  :)

Many have commented that this game is an elegant area majority game. There are few rules, no exceptions, and a deep strategy. The game is quick, our two player match lasting 30 minutes or so. My wife commented at the end of the game that there is a lot of thinking required. I haven't played many area majority games. Kreta and Dynasties are two that come to mind, though I do own and want to play China.

I like the mechanic that has you trying to increase your influence in a faction by pulling the resources from the board. This inherently makes that faction's influence on the board less powerful. This is a very counter-intuitive mechanic that makes for some interesting play decisions.

King of Siam is an intriguing game, but seems slightly dry. More plays may increase this rating as a deeper understanding of the strategy evolves.

RATING: 6
Interesting game though I am thinking that too much of the game hinges on the last turn. As in I feel the game is too much of a move followed by a countermove which leaves things basically stalemated till the last turn. This takes a lot of the tension from the rest of the game which simply feels like posturing till the endgame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I really like the tradeoff in that the more you invest in a particular faction, the less influence it has on the board since you are removing its cubes from the play area to keep as your own as indication of your control.  However, I feel that due to the limitation of the actions available and how the regions are arranged, the outcome of each game is largely determined at setup when the initial cubes are drawn.  Furthermore, while King of Siam is best with 3 players, I am somewhat perturbed by the fact that unless everyone play conservatively, it would be a far more likely scenario that two of them would find themselves competing for control early, leaving the last person to dominate near the end.

This is a quick and a fairly adequate area control game with a couple of really nice ideas.  Unfortunately, the aforementioned problems really disrupt the flow of the game itself, and as a result I find myself only wanting to play it occasionally.

After 2+ Plays: Both of my plays were with 3 players, and I don't know if changing that would significantly change my opinion of the game.  When it was described I thought I would really like the game, but the actual playing didn't live up to expectations.  A big problem is that ties seem quite likely, and the tie-breaker is annoying--Ties are broken by the player who plays last.  Combine that with a strictly limited number of actions for each player and you end up with people doing nothing, trying to wait each other out.

Очень короткая и чрезвычайно напряжённая игра на противостояние трёх этносов в политических страстях. Чистое евро, голое и строгое. Не терпит ни одной ошибки, "догнать" лидера невозможно. Суть заключается в лёгкой корректировке ситуации на поле путём симметричной руки карт игроков, и принятие стороны победителя, которого ещё определит противостояние самих игроков. 

Imperial в миниатюре. Минусы - при игре мастеров выигрыш зачастую приходится на ход по середине партии, где какой-то цвет какого-то игрока был выставлен позже. В связи с этим шахматным подсчётом каждого хода иногда становится слишком "сбалансированной", и в связи с этим хаотичной. Но ощущения после партии всегда чисты и прекрасны, как после чашки ароматного кофе.

"Never sell or trade games shelf" - Another gem. I love games where every move actually matters....unlike most euro type games where you make a bunch of silly-worthless moves and don't feel satisfied in the end. Highly recommended. First version as the King is Dead but I love both maps. If you only get one though get The King is Dead because of the mordrid variant included in the box.

Insides Moves is the best version in my opinion. The pieces are abstract and wooden, which I prefer over plastic horsemen or pawns. I am picky about game aesthetics and I wouldn't even play it if I had the plastic horsemen version. I do believe it is one of the best games I've ever played though, and simple enough to teach anyone in a few minutes.

This is a grand old strategy game by George Parker (of Parker Brothers), originally copyrighted in 1888.  A checkers-like game of jumping enemy pieces.  But because of the large playing field the game usually evolves into several independent battles.  This gives it a wargame feel.  I personally love Camelot and would like to see it reissued, although used copies are readily available on eBay.

1930 Tournament Edition
1931 Castle Edition
1940 Pictorial Edition
1954 Deluxe Edition
1961 Standard Edition

Camelot is a very fun game to play. Much more interesting than checkers (which I would never touch given a choice between it and Camelot), and plays a lot faster than chess.
I like how it plays out like a battle, with flanking maneuvers, feints, charges etc. Multiple victory conditions are very nice too; Total annihilation, occupation of the enemy's castle, or simply leave him unable to make a move.
It is brutal and very unforgiving of mistakes, but you just have to learn the capabilities of the pieces and stay alert. Very underrated and unappreciated game.
My favorite set is the Tournament Edition with its larger size board, which allows you to use full-size chess pieces.
The knights and foot soldiers from Kingsway Florentine chess sets are especially awesome to use with the TE board. Thanks to Michael Nolan for the idea.
If you like abstract strategy, pick up a copy on eBay. Parker Brothers made over 2 million copies during the 1930s, so it is readily available. Get one today! :)

A slightly more complicated version of checkers, so there's not a whole lot here.    The ability to capture a ton of pieces at once does make it somewhat amusing though.

I have the Inside Moves edition; its pieces are nice but the board and box's color scheme is dreadful.  A pity Hasbro didn't make a "Nostalgia" edition to go with their other games in the series in the early 2000's.  But then they probably let the rights to it lapse long ago...

Perhaps just a bit [i]too[/i] wide open.  Even playing on the internet - with three days per turn - I felt somewhat overwhelmed by the sheer number of possible moves and counter-moves I was forced to consider.  Playing OTB must be agonizingly slow if either player has even a slight tendency for AP. 

Still, it's an extremely interesting game, and pulling off an absurdly complicated multi-capture is easily one of the most satisfying things I've ever done in a game.  Makes it all worth it.

It may be old, but it's quite a unique abstract. The original thing is that this game is so violent... Captures can occur very quickly and you can lose all your pieces in one turn. The games are really quick, at least the first fews. This makes it interesting to dig further to try to understand it more. 

UPDATE: Lowered rating from 9 to 8. The position change too quickly, it makes it hard to read ahead. In other words: it lacks clarity.

RATING: 7
Camelot (aka Inside Moves) is a real interesting game that shares elements of halma and checkers.  Pieces follow halma rules when adjacent to their own pieces and checkers rules when adjacent to their opponents.  Knight pieces (for which there are only four per player) can make both halma-style and checkers-style moves in one go.  Almost anyone can play, and a building strategy is needed to win.  It can be an absolutely brutal game.  It doesn't feel like any other abstract I know as part of the strategy is to force huge sacrifices and mess up your opponent's positions enough that you can move faster into their castle than they can into yours. I originally didn't care much for the game because of the devastation that can develop rather quickly, but it is part of the game and part of the strategy to win.  I've warmed up quite a bit to Camelot over the years.  I think this is a fine abstract and for any fan of the genre, it certainly is a game that doesn't play like anything else. Deserves higher accolades than it receives.

My copy is the contemporary "Inside Moves" which features nifty wooden pieces instead of knights on horseback.  An excellent game that I had wished to trade, but now consider it a keeper, regardless of how often its played.

I've owned this copy of Inside Moves for a long time, over 20 years.  I really don't recall how I came to own it.  I have a 2nd copy for trade which has a pristine board...the box lid shows the wear of over 20 years but is in good shape.

This game of checkers-on-steroids holds up rather well (as most well-designed abstracts do) and offers a difficult strategic horizon to forecast (as one move is sometimes like throwing a bear into a pool of sharks, you know the sharks are going to win, but you're not sure as to how they're going to come out of it) -- It also turns out that this was one of the Parker brother's favorite games (that he had designed). Probably easy enough to find a thrift copy.

RATING: 9.75
A truly remarkable game that combines elements of draughts, Halma and chess into a concise package. This game will make a draughts player never want to play anything but Camelot again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
Akin to Draughts/Checkers, Chivalry/Camelot has a lot to do with how you set up your own men to create options for strategic movement and capture and respond to your opponent's moves and strategies.

All pieces may move in any direction orthogonally or diagonally, and all may jump over one friendly man (a canter). All may jump over one or more enemy pieces (a jump, proper), and are in fact required to do so if possible.

If a piece ends next to another enemy piece they must continue this jump movement. Enemy pieces jumped are removed immediately.

So all pieces are more or less like kings in checkers, but the 4 knights for each player may also combine the canter and jump in a move called the knight's charge, and this is where the game becomes fascinating.

Because the 4 knights are able to combine a series of canters, followed by a series of jumps, the possibilities for movement and extended capture become far more variable and far more interesting to predict and to setup.

I am rating it a 6.25 on one solo play, but I can easily see this being a more flexible game than chess (though more simple), and a game with far more depth than checkers.

An excellent find, in a very traditional line of games, and worth picking up if you enjoy abstracts.

Interesting little factoid.  It was THIS game that George S.

I've played it, and recognize its chess and checker origins, but don't regard it as anything more than an engaging abstract design.

I had trouble getting my head round this one.  Each time I played a very cautious game which was slightly compounded by my opponent playing in the same style.  Therefore the game felt like caution then at the first bad move the knighht would charge causing incredible damage and then going down in a glorious death.  I am sure that this cant be right.

Excellent strategic abstract that lies somewhere between draughts and chinese checkers and is almost as easy to learn but just as replayable and way meatier than any of both: the rules are compact, the gameplay agile, difficult decisions are already bothering after the first couple of moves for any approach to the game (every single move counts), and even though one mistake can be fatal players have to earn their wins and not just wait for the rival to commit suicide.

A historic game with mechanics vaguely like checkers, but the tactics are just so  fast and brutal. This is a great, quick, lightweight abstract strategy game—but the smaller version Cam is even better, faster, and more brutal. If you like that moment in checkers where you capture half your opponent's pieces in one move, then you'll love Camelot and Cam.

I found this to be a very pleasant surprise. Unlike most "jump over opponents to capture them" games that I own, this one does a great job of putting you right in the action since the pieces start out close to each other. Similar games that I own (traverse, leverage) start you far away so it takes a while before you actually are close enough to interact with your opponents pieces. I have the "inside moves" edition of Camelot and I am very pleased with the components.

Own as [b]Inside Moves[/b].

I am still unsure about this one.

Some mistakes can be far too punishing - my very first move allowed my opponent to capture *five* of my pieces, including two of my power pawns! I know what some people's response may be - "it's not the game's fault you made stupid mistakes" - but I never played a game where one mistake is so hopelessly irrecoverable.

This may be a result of the power pawn being so... well, powerful - its capacity to jump over its own units indefinitely and then capture indefinitely could result in half of the opponent's pawns captured. Yes, I know both players begin evenly, they both have that capacity, thus no advantage given to either player, but the fact remains that when one mistake is finally made it means utter destruction for the player who made it.

As such, the goal of the game is not to occupy your opponent's goal but to simply not make a single solitary mistake as that what makes or breaks you.

If you are given to oversights, you will hate this game, as it will ruthlessly punish you for them.

If you want a challenge to work on your analytical skills, this is definitely for you... just be warned it won't be sympathetic.

I remember seeing Inside Moves available years ago and wanting it.  I never did get it.  However, back in 2004, after trying to figure out what it was several times, I found a copy for cheap on Ebay and snatched it up.  

So far, the play has been really uninspiring.  The power of the tall pieces with a move and a jump is pretty overwhelming.  Actually, jumping in general is pretty powerful.  With the pieces starting so close together, you can have a lot of trouble in a hurry if you are not careful.  Thus, good play seems to encourage separating from your opponent.  However, so far, those I have played have tended to want to charge straight forward, resulting in a bloody game.  Perhaps one day I will be able to play this enough with an interested enough opponent to try some of that separation type of strategy.  Until then, I have more interesting strategy games to play.

RATING: 9
A Checker like game based on medieval war, with more powerful units (Mounted Knights) on the wings and somewhat less powerful units (Infantry) in the middle. Typically, someone launches a devastating attack with a Knight, which might win the game but also might leave the attacker so disorganized that an immediate powerful counter attack could win the game for the original defender. Not unusual for the advantage to switch between the players several times. For such a simple game, it does simulate medieval warfare fairly well. Remarkably good game, considering it dates from the 1888. I would imagine this game gave Parker Brothers a powerful start.

A classic chess-checkers variant.  Classic with a reason.
I have the Parker Bros. "Inside Moves" version.

My version is called Inside Moves.  This and Go are the only pure strategy games I'll play.  The difficulty is in getting someone to play against.

I need to play this one a few more times because there is a strong chance my rating could rise to an 8. There is hidden depth here, and I love (in a hate sort of way) the opening. Due to high piece mobility and proximity to the enemy, the game forces you to engage with the other player right from the start. This leads to exciting yet devastating exchanges without any dilly-dallying during the opening. I bring this up because it relates to Dameo's (see my review) willingness to position opening pieces such that mobility is maximized. Camelot is slightly different, however, in that the pieces are initially close together, but the surrounding board is relatively huge -- and so pieces can spread out quickly. However, by spreading out, you open yourself up to attack.

Pieces capture in a manner similar to checkers, but with (again) increased mobility. Multiple jumps are possible, and encouraged. I have to do a better job setting up and anticipating the multiple jumps that seem to be both common and bloody. Bunching my pieces would seem a safe tactic, but the game doesn't allow for that because you have to spread out to attack, and to pursue one of the game's two winning conditions.

Interesting is that Camelot is both a crossing game as well as one of material capture. You can win by move pieces across the board to your enemy's home base, or by wiping his pieces from the board. Balancing those two objectives is challenging, but also a means to increase tension in the game. There is always something driving the game towards its conclusion. You can't get bogged down in a capture race because there is always the possibility that the other person will maneuver across the board for the win. So you have to stay on your toes.

All in all, Camelot (aka Inside Moves depending on the edition you find) is a game that mashes together concepts from Chess, Checkers, Chinese Checkers, and others. This mish-mash works, but my rating is a little lower for now because I haven't yet found the game's focus. There is a lot going on, and the game can feel daunting as a result. With more experience, I may be writing an updated review with a better focus myself.

A game I used to play as a child. I recently managed to get a good copy from Ebay and now play with my 12 year old daughter.

Also played it at my local gaming club and it goes down OK as a filler.

I have the 1950's version with plastic knights. Really neat game- mine is somewhere in storage. I also have the wooden version with metal spheres on the tops.  Also in storage.

I love this game. On nearly any sized board it just takes on so many dynamics throughout the arc of game play. Games start out with a huge degree of caution as that first multi-jump/elimination move can be lethal.

Seriously considering paying good money to have someone build me a beautiful Camelot board.

Complete and in like-new condition on the inside.  The box looks as if something sitting on top bled through a bit, but otherwise is very sound, with no ripped corners.

Tentative rating after a quick play ([b]Cam[/b]) against an AI.  It is a house-of-cards sort of strategy game, in which you deliver (or receive) devastating blows in a single turn.  Interesting and suspenseful.

I do not have the board for it.  I just have the playing pieces and rules for it.  Also 2 little flyers.  They are in a nice little box.

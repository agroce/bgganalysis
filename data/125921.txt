1st Play: Broke this out on the afternoon of New Years, and I expected the kids to not like it.. Pleasant surprise, my 8 year old enjoyed it, and she won without buying a single Coco. Proof positive that reading the gripes on forums are no replacement for actually experiencing the game.

2nd Play: I enjoyed it again, solid kid game, and my kids enjoyed it too. The wife liked it and the turns play fast, the bits are well produced, worthwhile introduction for gaming.

If Settlers of Catan is about one thing, that thing is trading.  Imagine my surprise to find that the stripped down "kids" version of the game is basically sans trading but still a fun way to introduce kids to the series.

The Pirate theme helps quite a bit and the components are top notch.  

Players still build connected routes, and still have to be wary of the the robber (who is now a ghost pirate).  Players can exchange goods with a neutral marketplace in order to fulfill the building requirements they need.

recommended for families.

RATING: 7.5
A watered down version of Catan that (mostly) works for kids and adults. The game gives you pre-determined starting spots and simplifies the trading by allowing straight 1-for-1 trades at a market on the board. You only roll one die as well so every spot is equally good. For kids, this is an above average game that teaches set collection and route building. The components are pretty nice with thick cardboard resource pieces and plastic minis for the players. My 4 year old enjoys this although I can see him outgrowing this game fairly soon.

This game is good for kids just getting into serious games.  It is an excellent introduction to Catan-style resource management without being difficult.  I started playing this game with my kids when they were 6 and it went well and they enjoy it.  Adults will probably not find this game all that interesting because most of the games tend to play out exactly the same way, but it's way more fun than most games you can play with your kids at that age.

This is a very good Catan implementation for kids. My six year old can grasp all the concepts, though I still assist with resource distribution, and my four year old grasps everything except the rolling for resources.

RATING: 7
Honestly, the first time I played this I was not really taken by it.  I have since started teaching it to my four year old son and he's picked up on it very well.  I think there are three mandatory house rules that make the game significantly better, those being; (1) Can only purchase one parrot card per turn, (2) Trade with the stockpile at a 3:1 ratio instead of 2:1 and (3) Do not use the marketplace and instead trade with opponents.  This last one is listed in the rulebook as a variant.  Those three rules changes significantly improve my enjoyment of the game.  My 9 year old daughter really enjoys it as well but my 12 year old daughter could take it or leave it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great introduction to the style of gameplay in Settlers of Catan.  The theme is great (Yay, Pirates!) and is reasonably easy for kids to play.  
This game can become very one sided so we play the houserule of only 1 Coco tile per turn.  Even then it can still be quite uneven, not the greatest where kids are involved as they may become discouraged.

This was a big hit with my daughter (see her geeklist: Views of a 5.8 Year Old: Capsule Reviews from My Daughter). Enjoyable, but a HUGE first player advantage in being able to buy a parrot (development card) right out of the gate and take the lead on that build (effectively the largest army/longest road bonus). Plays quick, has the essence of Catan, and seems to capture my daughter's imagination.

The game is okay.  It has the same idea of building towns and roads, but has been simplified drastically.  The only real neat element are the parrot cards and building on pirate island (whoever has the most parrot cards).  Usually my kids pursue this, and I let them fight it out with eachother, while I focus on my thing and win.

This is a nightmare!!!!

This game is a disservice to kids and adults. The coco cards are extremely unbalanced, collecting resources gets out of hand quickly (second turn), and trading? Social? Haha... It has a runaway winner take all basis to its entire design which is, worst of all, really a poor representation of what is out there in the world of tabletop games. Yuck yuck yuck! SO many other GREAT games for kids out there!

Good introductory exposure to resource management.

Out of the box, the game is great for 5-6 yr olds. 

To make it more fair, only allow one Parrot tile to be acquired on a player's turn, otherwise it could easily chain into more Parrots and that gets out of control quickly. Go with 3-for-1 exchanges instead of 2-for-1, especially if playing with ages 8 or higher. And if you want a longer game, ignore multiple resources to be acquired (allow just one) if a player has two or more lairs built next to the number rolled.

RATING: 6
Since I bought this to play with my son, I didn't have high expectations of it. However, after a single play, I am surprised to say that this is perhaps a better game than regular Settlers of Catan (non-Junior version). Basically, this "kid's" game streamlines it down to a 30 min affair by getting rid of player to player trading (although that is an official variant), cities, longest road, and VP developments. It has the same feel of regular Settlers, and even scales down to 2 players by using a double-sided board--why doesn't the other game do that?

At this point, I would rather play this than regular Settlers--even among adults. 

Also worth noting is that the production quality is poor compared with other Euro publishers and even other Mayfair games. Instead of wooden bits, it has plastic. The box is also very thin cardboard, as well as the board. The goods are shaped cardboard tiles that don't stack well. And it doesn't come with plastic baggies to put the pieces in. About the only bits that are of decent quality are the Coco tiles, player aid tiles, and the die.

RATING: 7
Excellent version to play with kids; it's certainly less complicated than the original but retains the feel, and two can play. The pirate tiles (the counterpart of the development cards in the original) effectively give you an extra turn and then some, so the idea is to buy those as often as possible (although the one-per-turn variant suggested in one thread is an excellent idea). One could wish for more strategic options, but, hey, the game is meant to appeal to children.

For a kids version, this is awesome.  Though when I play as the yellow player, I never win. I swear it is rigged. Great for 5-7yo.  Thank goodness we have graduated away from it, but it still deserves the 7.5 for accessibility and choices for 5yo kids.

RATING: 6
Surprisingly effective child friendly version of Catan. They have managed to streamline the full game to a fast paced version that still maintains many of the mechanics; even the largest army is kind of there through the occupation of Spooky Island. After tile games like Tsuro and Carcassone this is the next step for budding board game geeks as it introduces resource management and trading.

Simple Catan game for the younger gamers.  It works well enough, providing you use the German rules for the Parrot tiles.

Yes, I own a Catan game: Junior, as it should be.  Nieces love it, so I play it.  It's very simple and clicks with kids.  I'm not sure what they like.  Maybe it's the cute goats.  Maybe it's the formulas you use to pay for things.  Or maybe Catan is cool, in all of its forms, and I mostly don't get any of them.  Mostly.

UPDATE:
Still going strong two years in.  Kids love gaming the CoCo cards -- buy a CoCo card, cash in CoCo bonus, buy another CoCo, on and on.  They seem to have a blast.  Like all Catan, I have absolutely no idea what all the fun is about.  I smile and nod and play along.

Catan Jr is a great kids game.  Junior introduces kids to the Catan system of trading, but is very forgiving. You still build cities and roads (errr...

Not a huge depth game, but is certainly fun and is especially good against kids ages like 7-10. If they have more game experience, they will enjoy it (but not if played often, as adults), and if they are just learning board games this is a great intro to euro style games without being too unforgiving.

Maybe it is my burnout from Settlers of Catan (and bad experience playing with people who don't know how to trade), but it is telling that I give Catan Jr. and Settlers of Catan the same rating.

A full game captures her attention and engages her for the full time. I love that I can see the wheels spinning in her mind and know she's weighing her options. Any game that can get her mind running and she can have fun playing like this deserves a high rating. She is also a coco the bird junkie and knows to carefully place the ghost captain due to consequences of having him on the space. Family favorite game in my house.

Terrific introduction game for younger kids. It has simplified trading, but still similar to Catan, and only uses 1 die (no probability distribution to worry about), and a cool pirate theme. But still involved enough that the adults wont want to blow their brains out when the kids want to play it.

This really does a great job of catching the flavor of Settlers of Catan. The game play is very similar. Just streamlined and simple. My 6 (almost 7) year old son grasped the game very quickly and proceeded to beat me in our first game. Definitely my favorite kids game that we own so far.

Love what it does for the idea. Make the game work well for kids/family. Keeps the mechanics and turns it in to a viable option for a family game. Sure it loses the luster of the adult version but I'm playing with my children which gives it much more value to me.

RATING: 4
Rated as a kids game. With even younger kids, I think you're much better off playing regular Catan with open holdings than this version. The advantage of this one is that you don't have to add the numbers on two dice together and teach that the 8 and 6 spots are better than the 9 and 5 spots, etc. But the resources are more abundant in this version, and everyone has the equivalent of a 2:1 port for each resource. The result is that players often have a lot of resources on their turn and a large number of options for how to trade them with the stockpile and what to build with them, which really only an older kid or adult could optimize. So for the kids to have any chance to win, the adults have to either hold back in their own play or help the kids -- and at that point why not just play regular Catan (or any other game where you're going to hold the kids' hands the whole time). If you want a kids game where the kids can compete on their own, of which there are plenty, look elsewhere.

Impossible to rate.  I only play this game with my kids, so that makes it a ten because . . . well, I'm spending time with my kids and that's great.  And it's teaching them strategy, planning, social skills, and it's getting them away from the idiot box.  But . . .

. . . having played regular Settlers, well, obviously this is for kids.  Still, I enjoy playing it, solely for the time I spend with my offspring.

I'm not a big fan of Catan.  I never really was.  When I heard about Catan: Junior though, I figured I'd give it a try.  I have to say, Catan: Junior made me enjoy Catan.  I like how you're not dependent on your opponents for trades as much as you are in Catan.  I also like the Parrot cards and the simplicity of rolling a single die and grabbing up materials in that manner.  Good, little kids game that plays well even for adults.

RATING: 6
2015-11-05: Rating as 6 after having played this for about 1 year now at the game store with my kids. Everyone seems to get into it when we first start playing and it doesn't drag on like regular Catan does, so the random dice rolls don't feel so bad. Turns also seem to go much faster and the Marketplace tradepost is an excellent mechanic, one that I feel regular Catan could use to its benefit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice version of Catan for kids who are not ready for the real thing. Enough here to keep the adults playing with them interested enough. I would say this has a shelf life in the age range of 6-9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good resource management game for the kids.  Often the matches are very close, despite the randomness of the dice rolls.  One time there was a very large spread.  The pirate ghost sat on the same spot for the entire game.  The number for the spot kept getting rolled, stretching the leader's lead with every turn.  Coco cards may be unbalanced, and there is a lot of talk about this on the forums (house rules, etc.).  A lot of games are won by who has the most of these (because they get to put out an extra base for free), and who got the FIRST one (because it can help that player's resource collection to gain early momentum).  Some meaningful decisions to be made, such as which directions to build your bases, whether to cut off other players, which spots to deny with the pirate ghost, and whether to invest in Coco cards.

Christmas gift for my daughter, who LOVES it!
Like most girls I ever played Settlers with, she thinks the building and expanding parts are much more fun than the winning part, which stops the game, and should be drawn out as long as possible... :)

And the components are fun to play with when daddy is too busy to play, making dinner or whatever...

I feel really stung by this game. It had received such positive reviews, thought I would be clever by getting it for my children for Christmas. The kids hated it. My wife hated it. I hated it. Virtually no decisions, just wait for you resources to come in a try to buy stuff. And you don't even build interesting buildings. Ships and Pirate Lairs over and over. I don't say this often, but I think I could have thought up a more interesting game.

Children's game rating.

I think it's still a bit more complex than it should be. On the other hand it works fine, in case you can find a 6-year-old (I'm not talking about gamer kids) who are ready to listen to so many rules explanation they might like it. For an adult it's still pretty luck-dependent, but for a game for 6-year-olds it's quite a thinky one (that rarely ends in 30 minutes).

Rated as a kids' game. This is a really good simplified adaptation of Catan for kids. Roll 1 die instead of 2 for resources, trades are with a sideboard rather than each other, no actual robber theft, no "two space" rule -- but nonetheless it's recognizably Catan. Enough so that an adult can enjoy playing.

At the same time, it's simple enough that kids in the 7-year-old range can learn the game and play it correctly by themselves. It's remarkable.

Only real knock against it is that the insert is just garbage.

This is a terrific introduction to the Catan game world for younger players, and it manages to be good, fast fun for the adults, too.  Teaches great (albeit light) strategic thinking for young kids, and I feel like the "pirate island" theme really works quite well.  I have always had nothing but good fun playing this with my 7 year old.  He plays the full Settlers version with us as well, and there is enough variance between the two games that it doesn't feel like we are simply playing Settlers light.  It is nice to be able to play a Catan game in 30 minutes.  :)

I really love how this game takes the Catan mechanisms, simplifies them for kids and adds a pirate theme. No keeping track of score, no cards to hold onto (although you can buy Coco tiles that work as instants) and two simple trading mechanisms (1:1 once on the board per turn and 2:1 unlimited with the supply). 

Played with my son and wife and have to say that it's pretty fun and the player who makes the best decisions with what they have to work should usually win. It's not really one of those silly children's games that you'd play with your adult friends though.

Rated as a game for ages 6-10.  My kids, ages 7 and 9 really enjoy this one; I do, too- it's one of the best "euro junior" implementations that I've seen.  It has the spirit of the "big" game, but is simple enough that younger kids can play it.  It also plays fairly quick, especially with two players.  And there is enough going on that it's fun for adults.  My 9-year-old could easily play the "big" game, but her younger sister would still struggle with that, so this is a good gateway version.

Two and a half years later:  Still popular with my now 9-year-old, though her now 12-year-old sister has moved on.  I've upped my rating to a 10; cannot praise this enough as a game for the intended age group.

We bought this game so that our 5 yr old could take part in playing "Catan" just like her older siblings.  She loves it and by letting her "be the banker" she really thinks she's special and forgets that she is practicing counting and number recognition.  The game also uses pattern recognition for buying pieces which she loves as well.  I was floored how quickly she caught on to the strategy of trading at the marketplace.  I love how much this game "teaches" but she just thinks its FUN!!!!

Very nice components except the box feels very flimsy and the insert is awful. I really like the art on the board. This is a great way to teach young ones some more advanced concepts and should work well as a step up for younger gamers. My daughter caught on very quickly has enjoyed our games so far. There does seem to be a lot of luck in it, but it is still short and enjoyable. This is based on several plays on the 2 player board as I have not yet played with more. I do not regret purchasing this. It plays quickly enough that the high luck factor isn't too annoying.

It isn't much of a game for adults, but really I've played hundreds of games far worse that were made for adults.  With kids on the other had, it is a blast (I'd give it a 9 or 10 for a kids rating).  The thing that makes the game great is that little kids can play it for real and adults that play with them don't have to cheat for them to win and aren't bored playing it with them.

Once a kid starts buying into Coco the parrot they start getting a taste for it.  They get so excited and can't wait to see what they get.  Plus the race for the most parrots and the instant reward of getting a lair out reinforces it.  It is like watching little junkies in the making.  I could pay rent (buy a lair), but I'm just going to get one more Coco.  That said, I've seen kids win with the Coco strategy.  

All in all it is super fun and everyone gets excited.  There is nothing more satisfying to watch that a stoked 5 year old teaching the game to a 7 year old and then watching the 7 year old teach the game to other kids chomping at the bit to play.

Picked this up at the 2012 Australian Toy & Game Expo specifically to play with my 5 yo son and a couple of his kindergarten friends. Played twice, 2p then 3p. He's played a number of other young kids games so I knew he'd understand the rules well, despite this being the most complicated of the lot (others are for 4+, Catan: Junior is 6+). Although he was busy making up stories and playing with the cool pieces when I was explaining the rules, we got there and he became very excited when the game started. He loved the whole building his engine and getting more resources so he could build faster part of the game. It is Catan at heart, but light enough for young kids. After the first game with me he was so excited that he wanted to play again with his mum too and started explaining the rules to her (wish I'd videoed it). So, far this is a real hit. It definitely has luck, but there's much analysis and thinking (for a young kid) to do in order to work out a good play. For me this sets it apart from most other good kids games that are primarily dexterity or memory games. It's a simple game for seasoned gamers, but even I had to think hard a couple of times.

Excellent gateway for younger kids at age 5 onward. Watching them click and start trading with ease at age 6 is fantastic. 

A bit pointless beyond the age of 8 (just play regular catan) but this is junior catan after all.

Top tip - stick all the pieces in a plano, compartmentalised plastic box that fits inside. This means the game has no set up time beyond sticking the board out. Works really well for school nights.

Settlers with streamlined rules and player trading replaced with a structured market.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating edged upward due to this being a game aimed at kids.

As with (curiously) many games I can discuss it in terms of "what you get to do" and "how you decide who gets to do what and when."

What you get to do in this game is reasonably interesting. Each player starts from two points at the edge of the map and wants to build inward and get all their pieces out. You collect resources from adjacent islands, can exchange them with a simple but elegant market, buy parrot tiles for perks (and having the most of these at any moment counts as having one additional piece out), and move around a ghost pirate to deny resources to others. I'd mainly criticize that the game ends before the routes got built as much as I'd like, so there wasn't that much blocking of paths.

It's the other side, the allocation/regulation of actions, that is very weak. The islands produce resources according to a die roll, which ends up meaning it's quite random whether and when you can build anything. Also, when you [i]can[/i] do things, you can do as many as you are able, in a single turn. This allows for some surprise wins and tension, so maybe it's good, but I think it aggravates the randomness.

The ability (actually requirement) to deny resources to others using the ghost pirate seems to create a negotiation element (not ideal to have here) and also a small means to attack the leader (which is probably good; the winner would be somewhat arbitrary anyway, so why not add some feeling of control).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating based on the joy my daughter gets playing this game (6 yrs old).  I almost like it better than normal Settlers now due to the fact that it is 30 min or less, probably 15 min with two players who are familiar with the game.  Scales well with 2-4 players (dual sided board with different setup).  Good gateway game for kids, nothing more.

As opposed to the Kid's of Catan which is tearable, this one is actually really good, mainly because it is the same as normal Catan with the exception that you trade with a market (at 1:1) or with the resource pool (at 2:1) instead of each other. This simple change (and possibly the pirate theme) means that the game can easily work for a four year old and above. It is quite a long game and quite hard work for a four year old so I wouldn't say its his favourite but it is still a hit. Rated 7 for the boy, 4 for me.

Does away with asymmetrical setup and some of the randomness, as well as p2p trading (now an optional rule). The idea is to acclimate kids to the basic mechanics without rancor or indeed much competition.

Worth it as a gift for a family of non-gamers, but for typical kids I'm guessing there's only a small window between 'Isn't even ready for Catan Junior' and 'Is ready for full-on Settlers'; Settlers isn't such a complicated game, after all.

We are not normally fans of the junior games, but this one is an exception for us. It is a great stand alone game that is fun to play for all ages, rather than being an overly simplified version of a game. Hats off to the game makers for not assuming little children only want to play boring games, and for making something the adults will happily play as well.

Well, yes, there was a legitimate problem for Klaus Teuber to address: no one under 8 is going to enjoy regular Catan.  The art is fun and elegant here.  The mechanics are perfectly simple.  And it's paced just about exactly right.  It's a good game, and we are playing it quite a lot.  But it's an interesting demonstration of the limits of the Eurogame design premises: without a certain volume of logistical complexity, huge volumes of subtlety and suspense evaporate.

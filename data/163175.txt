Pros: 
 - Quick and mostly streamlined (you use your deck for most stuff)
 - Tomes are an excellent mechanic, that also add flavour to each character. They offer you some interesting choices
 - Characters seem distinct and have their own style (I saw only 3 so far)

Neutral:
 - Artwork is decent, but looks inconsistent and not that interesting (can't say why)

Cons:
 - Attacks seem rather samey. Usually you can hit with most of them and positioning isn't that important, because if you want to attack, you're usually in range of your opponent, so he can just hit back. You'll just use the attack with highest damage.
 - Destiny phase is arbitrary, but has a huge effect. If I have the initiative I want a 1-3 combination, if I don't i want 2-2, with both being same probability. There's some light tactics stuff to it, but it seems badly designed, because it's mostly luck
 - Facing is annoying. Firstly the miniatures don't have a clear facing themselves, secondly it doesn't add much to the game, but must be constantly watched.

Overall the game is still rather good, because it plays so quickly that the negative points don't interfere that much.

As of this comment, I have played this game once and had a pretty good time with it. I like the way that the action pool is utilized and I like the idea of mixing the different decks. My biggest frustrating was keyword overload when I started playing this game. I'm thinking after more plays, it will play even better due to not having to constantly stare at the glossary.

After three plays of 2v2, it's become one of my favorite four player games that semi-normie gamers might play in a regular evening. Big caveat though, the 2v2 aspect. Haven't tried 3v3, but it sounds draggy ... although probably still better than 1v1 or free-for-all. 

Team play smoothes out the edges in terms of inequality and avoids kingmaking. We play to two knockouts - when a team is knocked out twice, they lose. It doesn't matter which character is knocked out. Same one twice or each one once. 

The theme comes through nicely, and the tome page turn mechanic is "novel". Boom!

Mini-facing is difficult to ascertain, as most relate in forum posts. Keyword-heavy, but the glossary is nice. Also, the simple rules are made tricky due to the instructions' strange writing style. Not sure what it is, but it has taken us three matches now to get a pretty firm hold on the rules. 

Straight up American stuff here, euro gamers should avoid this one. But that's probably obvious from the box cover!

It is a good game system with quality pieces.  It's customizable without getting into buying a huge collection of pieces every months or so.  It is "just right" for someone looking for a skirmish game without spending a ton of cash or sinking a lot of time into army building.

It's got lots of asymmetry, beautiful art, and it's pretty approachable--all definitely for the good in the genre of quasi-miniatures slugfest. However, it's pretty awkward in terms of player count; free-for-all is unabashed kingmaking much of the time, and two-player can be an unsatisfying slugfest with little positioning. That pretty much means four players exactly?

Game has awkward rules and some gaps we had to infer. It is a bit dry and boring. We played a 2p game. You take a move or combat action, then a tome action (flip a page in your book, pay to juice up an ability, etc). Movement and combat are limiting. Sometimes when the tokens are selected, there is only one combat token, then it's a card flip to see who gets initiative. Whoever does can grab the only attack token for that round. Leaving you with maybe a chance to attack out of your tome, but not always.

Attacks are dull and sometimes tedious because the target you are trying to hit has to be within the pattern of hexes on the attack card. Facing of the character is annoying because there is no arrow pointing from the base of the character, yet there are spearheads on the hex maps helping to show the flow. If your pattern doesn't fit, you are out of luck. If you want to maneuver first with a move card, the other guy will probably take advantage and wallop you with an attack, or simply move some other annoying direction. It's a bit of a dance between the combatants trying to guess which hex patterns the other guy has so that you can stay out of their range. But there's really no way to know this and sometimes you just turn and run away, dragging things out.

Many of the attack cards wind up being blocked. You can usually hold 4 cards, some of them have blocks. But you usually have one at the ready in a 2p game. Most/all of the damage is blocked. Some riposte back or trigger something else. The cards are interesting because an attack card generally has a piece of text that augments the attack like move into a better position after the attack or do more damage if X is present. The block cards have defensive text. Dodge is good because it allows you to sidestep and then if you are now standing outside of the attack pattern, no damage occurs.

I would say try it with 3-4 players, probably 3. Because if 3 players decide to gang up on one person, I could see them getting hammered and their hand gets depleted so that they can't defend themselves. I think that would make for much less fun.

The deck being your life force is pretty interesting. And one ability that I had was kinda neat - Heal: Place this card (from your tome) underneath your deck. When it is exposed, put a card from your discard pile underneath it. It helps keep you in the game a little longer, but in a 3-4 player game it probably wouldn't matter much.

I do like the "debuffs" you can give to other players. They're like curses or dots in MMORPGs. Each character has a special debuff (blinded, etc). You can then "detonate" them to do damage (but the condition is lost and you have to reapply it). The negative from the condition is sometimes worth leaving up but usually you just want to burn it as quickly as possible. This is because this damage cannot be defended against and it's a good way to quickly wear down an opponent.

After your deck depletes (each point of damage you receive is one card lost from your deck to the discard pile), you become "restored" and your avatar card flips over with slightly different stats and a somewhat different ability. Your discard and karma cards get reshuffled (karma determines initiative and is your fuel to power the spells in your tome). After this is depleted, you are out of the game.

I want to like this but it needs streamlining as our game took too long to finish. The things you can do on a turn aren't fluid and it's a lot of 'stop and start' moments that get tedious. This should be a fast paced duel ala SW Epic Duels and should last about 30-45 minutes. Ours dragged on for 1.5+ hours.

RATING: 7.5
Simple dueling game pick your master and a kami to go with it, shuffle the decks together and start playing.

The art is great as are the miniatures that come with the game.

One minor annoyance is the character facing. It's not always obvious so you might have to mark the base. Facing doesn't really come up much since you can change it freely when attacking and moving but when it does it can be a bit annoying. The other is the keyword USE when used to describe simply placing cards on the bottom of your deck (you don't actually trigger any abilities off of them), it can be a bit confusing at times.

I enjoy ther multiplayer aspect, and the life based deck mechanics also feel nice, but the games are too short.  Even with some of the variety, I still feel like you just run up and beat on one another with no real strategy.  Defense cards don't quite do enough and the karma damage is way to high with no real cost.  Kenta's fury damage and akiko's page 8 ability seem overpowered.

RATING: 5
A multiplayer fighting game. Rather unique for this style of board games, it doesn't work best with two. In fact, two players offers a subpar experience.

Like the idea a lot. Combine a character and his spirit animal? Yup, good fun. Sure, some combinations are simply better than others but hey, they offer recommended pairings if balance is that important to you.
Also, no real player elimination.

A fun battle game that suits 2-4 players, combining the character deck with your chosen Kami deck allows a lot of different strategies and replay value. This is only going to get better once the expansions are released. The combat mechanics allow for a lot of strategy and forward thinking which can be very rewarding.

Reading the reviews everyone says, "Beautiful Art!"  beware a game that has only that going for it!  Actually it has everything going for it, all thrown into one terribly complex, hard to teach, difficult to grasp rather boring package.  One out of six people so far enjoyed this game.  For me, not a keeper.

Pros:

Miniatures look great, card art looks great, mechanics are fun.

Cons:

Positioning attacks on the hex grid can be confusing when playing multiplayer. 

Built in kingmaker mechanic in multiplayer where a defeated player can come back to the game but will not be able to win the game, just beat on another player and decide who wins. The designers even wrote on a BGG forum that they thought kingmaking was fun. What?!

Which means that this so-called 2-8 player game with all of the expansions is actually just a two player game. :( :( :(

A beautiful game for 2 or more players. Played with more than 2, playtime explodes from 50 minutes to several hours. The card driven combat using two "smash-up"style smashed together decks offers a lot of variety. Character might not be balanced.

Good card driven arena fighter.
The characters felt somewhat unique. The combination of choosing a kami master and then a kami makes this game interesting.

When I played I didn't feel that my chosen character played that well with the chosen kami but it was still an exciting game.

RATING: 6.5
Based on one play: We played at four which seems better than just being two. You battle our based on a mix of two decks. First chose to either move or attack based on the remaining action tokens, then you can perform your action and one other ability. You gain karma to use spells and some land hexes provide benefits or penalties. Your deck is also your health so you don't want to race through cards. Fight off both opponents by eliminating their deck and you win.

I picked up the full Kickstarter version of Yashima with all expansions, this review will cover the base game but I might make reference to the extras.

For quality, I'm impressed. Box and card art is amazingly well done. The miniatures are large and very nicely detailed, with a satisfying weight when moving around the board. The board pieces are solid and look nice as well with the accompanying manual being well written and illustrated too. The cardstock is good. I always sleeve cards (since I tend to play games in a bar), so it's also a plus that the cards are standard size for cheap and easy sleeving. All in all, the quality of the components you get is top notch.

Gameplay is obviously the most important part of any game and I think Yashima is really good. You start with 4 decks for the different Masters and 4 different decks for "Kami" styles. While there are "canon" combinations of Master to Kami, you really can mix and match to get a lot of variety in your matchups. Each different match of Master to Kami style will produce a character that plays very differently, so there's a lot of variety in the base game. The combinations of Kami to Master can produce some that seem very strong as well as some that seem quite weak, but I've found none that I'd consider overpowered (even through having all the expansions) which is great.

Gameplay is relatively simple, but the rules took a little bit of reading to start. Play proceeds by drawing cards and playing attacks when you have an attack action, or playing from your spell tome if you have enough Karma in your cards displayed. Once everyone gets a grasp of the rules, play does proceed pretty quickly. The only slight negative on this side is the keywords, which often require looking up as they're not always obvious - and there are lots of keywords (something that happens more through expansions, which is a positive and a negative).

Your deck of cards being your life points is a mechanic I've seen before, but is a good one that works well. Cards constantly being put into your Karma deck means that this is a fighting game where you can't really turtle and sit back, which is a great side effect of the system. Players do have to get out and aggressive. In 3+ player games, the use of the restored mechanic (you don't die when you lose all your health the first time, you come back stronger - but your win condition is removed) is a good idea - but puts me off playing a FFA game, as a "restored" player essentially becomes "Kingmaker" (can't win, can decide who does). That's something I don't like in games. In a team 2v2 or 3v3 (with expansions), the "restored" mechanic works much better!

Overall, I find Yashima a fun game. I'm a big fan of Mage Wars, this is a quicker/simpler version of it. Getting through the first game with new players is tricky with all the keywords, but from the second game onwards - Yashima plays much better and quicker. Definitely a keeper in my collection!

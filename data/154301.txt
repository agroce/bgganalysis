So many neat ideas in this game that are criminally under-developed. There are rules blatantly missing all over the place when we had questions about entering the board, replacing ship upgrades, and parts of the boss. Love the basic gist of the game, but the flow is wonky as hell. I played with a group that got stuck in this mess for three freaking hours. What the hell.

I also think there's a seriously weird bent towards PvP for VP. We didn't go that route strongly because it feels like it's against the spirit of the videogames the game is imitating (aren't we trying to kill aliens?). But killing your buddies whenever you get a chance is one of the best ways to get VP and it's kind of annoying.

I'm seriously shocked z-man let this get published without far more playtesing, editing, and attention to detail.

This is basically an 8 or 16-bit SHMUP emulator for your Tabletop pleasure. Simple movement and upgrade rules allow you to fire at enemies (or other players), collect Power Ups, heal up Energy, etc. The background map 'scrolls', but honestly I could have done without the plastic rows altogether and just scrolled the cards on the table myself. The mechanic is a nice tribute to how the graphics in the video games work, and adds an element of the unknown as you wait for what different Space Cards and Bosses come out. Fun.

Board-game version of Galaga? Absolutely unique game, captures the 80s - 90s vertical scrolling shoot em up vibe terrifically well. Have played multiple times with different people and never had anything less than a fun experience yet. Given how different it is, could fit into any collection and add sometime totally different!

RATING: 4
The retro video gaming theme is cute, and the mechanics faithfully reflect the theme. But with five new players, it was a 2.5-hour slog that felt like the fiddliest parts of Mage Knight (constantly revealing new threats and planning an appropriate course of action) and RoboRally (blind determination of player order and the cascading effects of other player's actions).

Not interested in playing this one again, although I can see it playing well with 30-somethings nostalgic for their arcade gaming past.

Whoooo hooo. Omg, yay!!! I won the bgg contest and received this game, my first contest win, ever (both in and out of bgg). I love to play scrolling games on video games and look forward to seeing how it turns out on board games. Probably one of the worst storage solutions a game has ever come up with.
Played a 2 player game of this...was fun but i think the computer games are better.

Attention publishers: STOP trying to turn video games into board games. It's not working. Even still, this game could be decent if you removed some of the completely unnecessary mechanics (like the initiative cards- what is that about?) and made power-ups less ridiculous. What works in video games probably doesn't work well on a table.

Many ups and many downs. Upgrading, flying and shooting are satisfying. The turns are done quickly, getting shot down isn't too punishing and the threat mechanic works well. The scrolling is a nice feature and well implemented.

Problems:
 - In a 5pl game there's not enough to shoot at. The 3rd - 5th player will often have nothing to do, but shoot their friends. The game doesn't scale well.
 - Snowball: You are the quickest to get Bellonium? You'll upgrade first and become even quicker!
 - Euro mechanics don't fit with the game: The game encourages you to do weird things to gain points.
 - PvP is imbalanced. Shooting your friends is often the most point-efficient thing to do. When multiple players shoot the same player, he'll usually explode or has to skip a turn.
 - Initiative badly implemented. The way El Grande did it or just random, or clockwise would all have been better choices.
 - With no way to know what comes in the next row and completely determined results for what you see, you should just count the max. point gain / bellonium gain for your turn and do this action. This is dry.

This game captures the Shmup video game genre wonderfully. Unfortunately, it didn't feel like a great game, but it was definitely still a good one. I wouldn't seek it out again, but I'd play again so long as it was only 3 players. I played with 5, which I wold not recommend, but I don't think that would really change my overall opinion of the game, though it would probably fix my biggest fault: too long. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The game is sound mechanically and features some good decision making, but at around 90 minutes, it is too long for what it represents - a scrolling space shooter.

RATING: 7.5
Great game that simulates the old schmup games very well.  Will have to work up to the PvP aspect but until then it's a great game.  Only gripe is that some mission cards are very difficult while others not so much.

RATING: 3.5
In theory, it's great. In practice, it's too mechanical. Imagine if Gradius was a turn-based strategy game. That's not what you want from a side-scrolling shooter. Also, the way scoring works is not at all fitting for the theme.
I admire what they tried to do with this game, but putting euro mechanics on a theme like this makes no sense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
So the game is both good and bad.  The theme of the game is definitely a 1980s arcade game throwback and the theme comes through.  However, the gameplay is fiddly and repetitive.  I get the need to build up from simple bad guys to the boss monster and from rudimentary weapons to super-dooper ones, but it still feels repetitive.  we played as a 2-player and it probably is better with more, but it's definitely a game whose target audience is old men in their 30s and 40s, not young kids who will find the length and fiddliness of the game a turn-off.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Honestly not sure how much this will get played, but it's a fun experience and the retro video game inspired art is fun too. It feels like one of those old arcade games (kind of) and has some interesting things happen along the way.

Sadly, I think the theme pushes it into a niche group.

-sold-

It tries to recreate the feeling of a sidescrolling arcade shooter...and it does well.

Plays pretty fast, the scrolling mechanism works well, components are so so. The cards are too flimsy and could have used a better cardstock. Pointy corners and black borders are waiting to be marked.
The artwork is good for an 8-bit-pixel-style which is normally not well done...

But the game does its job. The more the merrier... I guess... I think 3-4 is the sweet spot. Depending on the cards 4 might be too crowded while 5 definitely is.

This game seemed really good when I saw it on the Shelf but it just has so much going on that I don't think I will ever play a full game. Too many components, directions that are too long. If they could simplify this game I buy the new version in a heartbeat. Cuz I love the idea of this.

I like the theme of old shoot-em-ups. It has a quite old school feel with the randomness, take that and fiddliness but it still plays in a reasonable time. I'd guess a 6.

RATING: 6
There is a lot of info overload on the tiles, and not a huge amount of upgrade variety. I want to love it, but the combat mechanics themselves... are really rather dull, if honestly assessed. A greater range of weapon/enemy abilities could have been integrated beyond the simple power-ups. But I'm keeping hold of it in anticipation of future expansions. Not a bad title, by any stretch... just, not brilliant - which is a real shame.

This game is F****NG Sick! It's definitely not a deep euro man's thinking game. It's a fast paced, semi-stategic beer and pretzels awesomefest! I love the 8-bit artwork, the theme completely fits the SHMUP love letter this board game is portraying and It's just a blast to play, especially with the pvp element.

RATING: 6
I really would like a way to get more mission cards, and I would appreciate a more robust and less "PVPish" system to award glory (most enemies defeated per round, perhaps?), but I'd still like to give it another go before I form my verdict. Co-op perhaps?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.75
One of the absolute favorite games in my collection.  I love playing it, and the tons of complexity and options that spring up every move from just having the basic actions then more and more gets added with every upgrade you tack onto your ship.  All of the parts and art are high quality and have a really great look and feel, and fit the arcade cabinet vibe.  Once you get the flow of the game down - it is a blast!  The only downside is setup can take a little while due to the sheer number of parts and cards.  A race for score with just enough "take that" involved to keep you on your toes!

Haven't completed a play but so far the first impression is quite good. This is a rather more euro style game than the theme would've let me believe, but that doesn't detract from the game. Action point system, small area battles, along with upgrading your ship make this game fun to play without the real time twitch video gameplay.

Lots of interaction through combat and small board space.

Not a fan of the random card draw for player order but so far it doesn't seem to hurt the game much.

Cool art, smart component design, okay quality.

So far, I have three playthroughs, all of them 2-player. This has been tons of fun. I'm looking forward to a few plays with a higher player count before giving it a rating. Unlike many, I love the ability to shoot other players, and to benefit from them blowing up. I do fear that with only four bosses, replayability will take a hit, though I have yet to play with the tunnel variant. More bosses, special cards, and cardsets in expansions will be much anticipated.

An excellent use of arcade/pixel art, and I think they absolutely nailed the theme! The scrolling felt better than I thought it would, and I enjoyed trying to complete my mission and the different achievements. There's a nice variety of enemies and obstacles to deal with each game, and it's great that they found a way to use cards to create the map so that every game will be different. Plus, there is a good selection of bosses to choose from.

- It falls apart when the bosses come out and everyone degrades into shooting each other which doesn't make thematic sense.

I absolutely love the art and theme of the game. It perfectly implements the retro arcade games of the 80's. The gameplay is fast and smooth, new players usually get it in the first few turns.

One of the best parts of the game is the ship upgrades. After a few times shopping your ship really feels unique. The mission cards and goals add a nice touch to the game and give a little more direction.

The rulebook could have used some more work, but that is about the only negative about the game. Definitely one of my all-time favorites.

It's fiddly, but this game is actually pretty good. It's so thematically beautiful, it actually feels like a retro top down shooter.

I don't like the PvP mechanics that much. It seems this would have been a more natural coop game. The achievements can swing a game pretty randomly too which can be frustrating. The rules aren't the best either.

Once you nail down this game though, the play becomes silky smooth and so much fun!

Very disappointed in this game I was looking forward to so much. The trouble is it can't quite decide what it wants to be - a co-op or a competitive game. Add to that the lack of challenge and non-existent penalty for blowing up and you have a very unchallenging hum-drum experience. 

Avoid, even if you like shmup computer games.

Had this for over a year collecting dust on the shelf before I finally pulled it off.  It was actually quite a lot of fun.  The "scrolling" trays are a bit of a nuisance but other than that is a very cool looking game that simulates the old shoot-em-up game play nicely.  
I want to play this more but I find the theme to be restrictive (in terms of interest from my gaming group).

Nice game, which really makes you remember the good old times of the Asteroids computer games, when you were loving the gameplay and graphics. Now adays you really wonder how you could have loved them :). But on the other hand the computer graphic like illustrations in the game are perfect. But the qualitiy of the materials: cards and especially the sliders is really bad.
The game itself has really simple basic rules, but a lot of details on Upgrades and different types of dangers which one has to memorize. Once this worked it is a really funny game. I would have hope for a little bit more differsion in the types of upgrades, but this will probably one of the key points of the planned expansions.

This is one of those games where my memories of it get more fun as time passes. It reminded me (oddly) of a much simpler Mage Knight, where making bold moves was expensive but you couldn't win by being cautious. I like that tension!

It also captured some of the feel of modern shmups much better than I expected it to.

On the other hand, it played slow and one of my friends had dire complaints about the turn-order bidding system. Playing with fewer than 5 people might help with both of those but could reduce the tension I liked so much.

Very interesting effort in simulating a classic shoot'em-up arcade game, although I could live without the PvP element. The game is highly thematic, even though the mechanics surprisingly tend to the Euro side of the spectrum, with no dice. The game is a little too long and a bit fiddly, but also quite fun and engaging. The box is very sturdy, but the plastic trays (used to facilitate "scrolling") are disappointingly cheap.

This game isn't bad, it's just that i couldn't have cared less about the outcome.
Maybe it's the rather unique game play & theme.. it made me wanna play R-type & other old computer games.. simulating this as a board game just made obvious what excitement you're missing out on right now.
The deterministic combat didn't help, there's no dice combat.. so this can become VERY thinky.. something arcade games are neither known nor loved for..

Played a couple of times now and I really enjoy it. Nicely ramps up due to how the level scrolls while maintaining a just-about-managable level of tactical and strategic thought.

It also has a really cool aesthetic and I appreciate how you can pursue different approaches in your playstyles with it still exhibiting a great deal of balance.

Does a great job giving the feel of an 80s top scrolling video game. The artwork is great and I like that each spaceship looks unique. Plays fast and fun. The combat isn't very complicated..I feel like it needs something extra there. A great game tho- tons of old school fun!

Wow... shockingly positive surprise.

Amazingly true simulation of shoot'em up video game back from the old 'pixel' days. You name it – shooting enemies, scrolling screen, asteroids, anomalies, power ups, achievements, several types of upgrades (each with its own levels), 'lives', bosses and a big boss at the end - it's all there.

And above all - it's NOT a clunky, forced game.  On the contrary – it's smooth, fun, satisfying design with a room for strategy.

The entry barrier might be a bit high (->no. of types of different elements of the scrolling board and the interactions between them) for new players so it's essential to know the rules perfectly when explaning the game.  Otherwise you might deter potential co-players and you surely don't want that :)  You actually want to _have_ co-players for this innovative and wonderful design :)

Seriously overlooked and underestimated game here, on bgg.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (March 2015)

All the idea behind The Battle at Kemble's Cascade sounded great, I dig the art, I even love the name and I really wanted to like the game but I was a sorely disappointment¡ :(. IMO, the game commits the worst sin a game can commit on my book , it has a very long downtime (with 5 players), a long playtime for what it offers and the decisions needed in the game are kind of obvious (so not interesting, you only have to move/attack or to recharge). It also has a lot of uncontrollable randomness, the worst offender are the initiative cards, I don’t know why they are in the game BUT they can disrupt your plans and there is nothing you can do about them  and if you played first this time and last next turn, the downtime is way too much for me. In each game you have a mission to accomplish and you can plan to achieve it, however many random evens can disrupt this plan (scrolling, someone shoots at you). The idea of fighting a boss sounded great and the boss cards are nice, but this part continued to be boring for all.

The game components and the ships are very well done.
 
I haven’t read the rules, but from what the friend who read them tells mem, there are some holes in them.

Bottom line, it sounded great but The Battle at Kemble's Cascade fails to deliver. The shoot 'em up scrolling games that it emulates are fast and furious but the boardgame incarnation is very slow and boring. It is however very novel the way they emulate the scrolling. I will get rid of my copy ASAP.

Current Rating: 4.0

RATING: 7
80s video games come to board gaming as you use your energy to move and shoot aliens coming down at you row by row, avoiding the asteroids and other obstacles, until you take out the big boss. Enemies are represented on cards, meaning that your tableau changes from game to game. Buyable weapons and power ups help as well. But for all the mechanics in the game, there is an imbalance with some of the upgrades... and there is no mechanic to slow down a player if they are moving far ahead of the others in terms of score, so it's possible to see one player already has won the game before the big boss even shows up.

PLUS: great use of theme, easy to learn
MINUS: manual isn't great, no balancing mechanism

A scrolling old school arcade game in a box! 

Brilliant and unique game where you all take a ship each and start to fly up the board but every round the bottom of the board is lost and comes back on at the top forcing you to move forward a space every turn regardless.

I'm not really sure what to make of this game. The box art makes me want to love it, but I don't think the game play will engage me much. Your goals are kind of obvious, you want to move and kill things while taking as little damage as possible. There are VPs to earn from achievements that anyone can claim (like in Tash-Kalar), and each player has their own mission to accomplish. There is certainly some opportunity for planning, but there are lots of random/chaotic things that can mess with you as well. Not the least of which is someone deciding to shoot you.

The game uses a neat cascading board comprised of 5 rows of cards. Each turn the bottom row is discarded, pushing players up if needed. A new row is then added to the top. This is supposed to invoke the scrolling nature of shoot-em-up video games. It's a neat system of modular board design.

It is an easy game to explain, and seems to have a certain fun-factor because of the quirky board construction, and subject material. Although, I'm not a video-gamer and have no fond memories of the shoot-em-up games of yore. I don't foresee this game having much staying power for me. Not high on my list of games to seek out.

As I mentioned above I love the box art, bright crisp graphics that still have that retro look. It's a shame that they went the 8-bit chic look for the rest of the game components. I would much rather a beautifully illustrated and stylized take on the 8-bit aesthetic (if such a thing exists) than anything approaching the horror of the genuine article. But, as I said, I'm not the target audience theme wise.

RATING: 8.25
Perfectly captures the look and feel of those classic 1980's arcade shooters. Although it initially requires a bit of spatial analysis that trips up some players, after a few turns it becomes easy to determine which direction you're shooting and you'll be zipping around the 'screen' like its second nature. My only complaint is that at higher player counts - with gamers who have a fair handle on what they're doing - the screen can quickly be wiped of enemies, leaving large, easily navigable, empty spaces. If the folks that you're playing with aren't keen on the PVP aspects of the game, it can cause a bit of a lull until the next wave of enemies arrives. Overall though, it distills the nostalgia of pumping quarters into an arcade shoot-em-up into a game that's easily understandable and highly enjoyable.

After a video review: This looks weird. I do like the theme and there seems to be more depth than another similar game on the Game Crafters.  The Player vs Player makes no sense, there are a few other mechanics which are weird or feels uninteresting like the mission for example. Not sure if the game is balanced with different amount of players, It's playable as solitaire but might be very hard to play.

But one thing that looks interesting is the boss battle. In fact, I think they should have only put boss battles in the game and scrap the rest of the game.

First Impression:

Enjoyed my first play with two players which took us slightly over an hour after rules.  Brings in the feel of the arcade relatively well and the scrolling mechanic is pretty solid.  Several different effects are in play on the boards and represent the arcade game well between different power enemies, black holes, asteroids, jump points, etc...

This was another game that I really, almost desperately, wanted to enjoy, but when I actually got to play a game it just fell completely flat on it's face. The game does an okay job of mimicking a side scrolling spaceship shooting game (i.e. Galaga), with enemy ships, asteroids to be avoided, and even a big boss at the end of the run. The graphics are unfortunately par for the course for Zman games (please hire a better graphic designer Zev!). I have no idea how they made 8-Bit artwork into something so ugly, but they did. The gameplay is just so-so with mechanics that didn't make me feel like I was side-scrolling my way to a big baddie. I felt like I was playing a board game that was trying really hard to imitate a side-scroller. Other than the artwork the components also could have used more work as the demos for the game at GenCon all were using tape to keep the card holders for each column of the "screen" in place. Gameplay was almost completely forgettable. Look for your 1-UP somewhere else.

This game has surprisingly more tactical depth than its cover or description would leave you to believe.  It's all about efficiency, and making best use of your actions every turn to score you the most points or get you in a better position next turn.  There is a lot of silent contemplation over your turn in this game -- more than the "pew pew" theme would suggest.  I was pleasantly surprised by the tactical depth but it has turned down some people who were expecting something casual.

This game overstayed its welcome by at least an hour.

It would have been fun, if it had taken the advertised 60-90 minutes, but especially the end draaaaaged.

Furthermore the turn order mechanism is seriously unfun. If you get only low cards by the time it's your turn, there is nothing left to do for you except to take potshots at the other players (with your inferior weapons, because you never earn enough to upgrade as much as those who got to shoot early).

I think this could be salvaged into a fun chaotic game, if its duration was trimmed and the turn order mechanism was fixed.

I really like this game.  It's exactly the kind of example I love to pull out when faced with getting new people into the hobby.  My only real criticism is that when playing the game, it is exceedingly easy to gain glory, while exceedingly difficult to gain more bellonium.  The only reason I bring this up is that, as a video gamer, I enjoyed playing these top-scroller games because you want to level up your ship and see just how powerful it can become.  Unfortunately the opportunities to gain bellonium in the game, while present, are few and far between.  Sure there are enemies that award $, and the occasional universal symbol pops up and everyone gains 1 bellonium, but it's to the point where, by the end of the game, you can only afford to upgrade 1 system the whole way, and that's by ignoring any of the other cool weapons!   

I've been toying with some house rules as to how to address this, but they need further testing before I'd post any variant options, but they mostly have to do with rewarding behavior in game.  Maybe each character has a different unique way of earning money (minor: gain 1 bellonium for every 2 asteroid energy destroyed each turn; Mercenary: gain 1 bellonium when you destroy the same color ship as the lowest sensor bid each round; SpaceHulk: gain 1 extra bellonium when you destroy an object by running into it.), or maybe there's a global way of earning extra bellonium, by offering any of those unique abilities to the board at large.  Maybe instead of glory, ships can gain bellonium by completing space mazes.

Regardless of all this. I think The Battle At Kemble's Cascade is a fantastic, creative, cool, and often funny example of what board games can do, and I'm always up for another game of it.

A little fiddly with a lot of parts, but fun.  Every move you make can mess with your opponents' plans and it's fun to see them stress out as you do something that ruins their plans.

When I heard of Kembl's Cascade, I thought I would be playing a very dynamic game of shooting, powering up, destroying dozens of enemy.

I realized it's not the game I was expecting.

Nevertheless, Battle at Kemble's Cascade is a nice game of optimization. The theme is very strong in the game. It still allow surprise with the bosses which are really huge and some fast plays when the rules are understood (you do not wait 5 minutes to play your next round).

The first time I played we totally screwed. One of the player nearly rage quit the table because it seemed difficult and unfair game (crashing from one asteroid the the other).
Then I made another one with another group, explained the rule more accurately and that second game was awesome! 

Since then I have some great fun with this game!

I would be expecting from an extension to add a big variety of new tiles, and why not, some middle boss to be added to the pile of tile

Space games where ships can't be at the same place or can't even pass through occupied space squares always fail to embodied the most obvious criteria of what space is. Some space games (like this sucker) even fail to understand propulsion carrying you forth when space literally sucks you back at the end of a turn. Would be worth playing to experience what a busted game changing random initiative "mechanism" looks like.

This game is a blast, and much more clever than just its cool screen-scrolling mechanism.

Really cool game. The scrolling mechanic is very unique and does a good job a re-creating the 80's space invaders video game feel. The art work is beautiful - it really attracted me to the game. But unfortunately, the mechanic and artwork alone was not enough to keep me replaying it. I mostly played it with two players so not sure if that is the reason I found it a bit boring and flat, but it just didn't live up to its good looks. It's a really cool idea but each game left me feeling frustrated and a bit irritated even - it was a bit finicky.

A remarkable game !!

This boardgame simulates perfectly the ''shoot'em up'' retro arcade styles.

Ever played Raiden, Gradius, Gigawing, etc. ?! If yes, this game will reminds you all the good memories from your childhood, but without losing your coins every 2 minutes. 

The mechanics are easy to understand, but very tactical and challenging as the game goes on.

Lots of depth for this kind of game, as I was totally surprised by the quality of the flow and the gameplay. The components are a bit cheap, but everything else are great.

It's definitely a Euro-game, as there are no dice involved. There are also several ways to play the game: If you want PVP elements, use the cards for it, if don't don't want, just remove them from the game, simple as that.

Overall, this game is pure GEM !! Get it now while you still can !!

This game emulates the 8 bit atari space game very well. That being said, this game is not ready for prime time. It felt like there were a lot of rules they changed or pulled out when it was close to production, and then they didn't test the game enough in it's new form, so there are some artifacts of the old rules like icons that mean nothing, turn order mechanics that are weak, and some techs and goal cards that aren't balanced. The plastic trays you use to hold the rows of cards are super poor quality.

I'm on the fence about this one.  I love the idea, but I found myself feeling like, "well, yes, they've totally captured what it is like to play a vertical shooter in a board game...but, uh, if I want to play a vertical shooter, couldn't I just go play one right now?"  
I can't come up with a response that defends this purchase.  Oh well, at least I got it cheap, and the box is cool.

Explode! Respawn! Repeat! Kemble's accurately captures the feeling of the old school arcade shooters, but does this really translate well to the board game format? It seems shields are the obvious first upgrade, since if you're blowing up the least you can guarantee to still be on the board to collect points when other players explode. It's a silly mechanic that encourages players to snipe each other at low health. The micro-management of sliding down the rows of cards can get tedious, and the ships obviously should've come with flight stands (there's already a hole!). Despite all of these minor annoyances, Kemble's manages to provide a fun experience. It's a bit of a gimmick, and I won't always feel like returning to the Cascade, but I can see it improving with an expansion or two.

Rated from 1 play. Euro style game with an 80's video-game-shoot-'em-up theme. Feels quite unique with the gameplay and captures the theme well. Good opportunities to screw other players over with PvP and maneuvering. Played 5-player and playtime seemed a little long - suspect it would be better with 3 or 4.

I got part way through the rules / learning game and gave up.  This is a complex fiddley game about doing the obvious thing on your turn and hoping other players don't decide to spite you.  Rating would likely go down if I finished a full game.

Also, I was promised a solo option, but the game seems to be 2-5p.

RATING: 7
Fun game with interesting mechanics.

I played it with three other friends. It did take a while (~2h) but it was fun. The art is neat, the components are quite decent, the threat/energy mechanic works, the game becomes increasingly difficult as it goes, the final boss fills the entire screen, power-ups can surprise you and your mates, achievements and equipment keep you active as your fly "through the screen".

The screen scroll thing is quite cool, giving you that Galaga feel, and it's not boring to handle. The game may take a while to set-up but after that, it flows smoothly.

My only complaint is that there is no penalty when you die - nobody did that when playing video games. But it does allow for interesting strategy, though. I, however, was able to win dying only once and being a noob.

It probably plays best with more than 2 people.

Another interesting thing is it could be played solo.

A fun and fairly realistic simulation of the old style arcade shoot 'em ups where you fly a spaceship through space, dodging bad guys, asteroids and black holes until you encounter one of four different boss monsters at the end. While you will need the FAQ to enjoy this game, I have played it several times and liked it each time. It allows you to play co-operatively (nice) or PVP style (mean). You will definitely earn more points if you play PVP, IMO. All in all, it's a fun throwback to the 80's which I would like to get to the table at least two or three times a year.

Fine for what it is, "The Battle at Kemble's Cascade" really captures that old arcade shooter feel. 

It's quite random and there isn't much to it. After a couple of plays it's easy to see which upgrades are objectively better than others. Once this happens the game loses most of it's challenge. 

Variant rules can add difficulty, but feel tacked on, and adding impassable walls to the sides of the "board" limiting movement also limits fun and feels more unfair than more difficult.

The game is also very cheap, both in price and quality. Low quality card stock with sharp corners and chintzy trays that make up the board crack and break easily. The low quality trays also made it very difficult to "scroll" the board unless playing on a bare table.

This game pleasantly surprised me.  This game is meant to emulate the experience of playing one of those video game "shmups", or shoot-em-ups.  Think Galaga.  I wasn't too terribly excited for this game because I'm not a huge fan of those types of games.  However, I actually think this game feels a good deal different than those types of video games and I found it enjoyable.  The flip-side to that is if you really do enjoy those types of games and were looking forward to this for that reason I would temper your expectations.

The reason I don't really feel like this is a "shmup" made into a board game is those types of video games are all about speed and reflex.  This is a very slow tactical game.  Each round each player will play a card with a number on it and the highest number goes first, much in the same vein as Robo Rally.  That player then gets a free move and a free fire action and can spend their energy to do more.  However, energy is also your ship's health so you have to be careful when and how you spend it.  The board is made up of alien enemies and lots of obstacles such as meteors and black holes but also has spaces that give you extra power ups, energy, money, and even points.  There is also a PvP systems so you can open fire on other players for additional points (and to hopefully set them back as well).

The main scoring method in this game are "achievements".  These are special goals that can be achieved by players each turn for points such as killing a certain number of enemies or attacking a certain number of players or adding a certain number of upgrades to your ship.  This is another way that the game feels a lot more tactical and different than the game I thought it would be.

I think it is way too fiddly for me to want to have to manage (the board "scrolls" and you need to pull a line out and add a new one to the top each round) and even though it pleasantly surprised me, it isn't something that I'm super excited about.  One of the biggest problems is the imbalance in some of the elements.  I got a sour taste in my mouth when I drew a pretty weak and conditional Power Up card to start the game and watched other players play very powerful and exciting ones.  Also, I feel like some of the weapons are much more powerful than others, especially the beam cannon that can clear an entire line of the board.  It makes the other weapons pretty much not worth pursuing and if you don't know that going in, you can fall behind against someone who does.  But in the end I did enjoy myself and enjoyed the game play and mechanisms in it.  It certainly is unlike anything else I've ever played, and there's a lot to be said about that.

So much to like here.  If you've ever played a scrolling shooter, this is exactly what you already know but ported from digital to analog.  I was amazed at how well the spirit of those games was captured in Kemble's Cascade.

I think one of the things I really liked about this game is the fact that it's basically a constantly changing puzzle.  It's got short-term strategy with a lot of tactics.  

Even more, this game rewards timing and I think that's what really drives the game.  Some people will complain about the PVP aspects, but those serve to drive timing. I really think it's pivotal to the game and not nearly as tacked on as it first appears.

I've been thinking about my first play constantly and can't wait to play it again.

If Kemble's Cascade is trying to recreate a fast playing video game then it fails badly. It is pretty light and really shouldn't involve AP, but it's far from a brainless, fast twitch game. I really dislike a lot of the production; the ships are cheap and look pretty rubbish, the card trays are functional at best and I personally dislike the 80's style artwork.

The game itself was moderately interesting with a pretty simple progression; get better everything in order to give yourself more option. It all functioned pretty well together, but the rulebook was a bit of a mess and it was never deeply engaging.

RATING: 7
The game nicely converts a lot of the aspects of classical 8bit 2d vertical shooters, most obviously the implementation of the artwork, but it is missing one crucial element, which is the frenzy that was always part of these games. An insane number of projectiles headed your way with only a couple of millimeters space to dodge them. To convey this sort of feeling you'd need a real-time element. And as such it would require a new game. But the game as it is does so many things right apart from just the graphical conversion. I for one love the upgrades and the power-ups, love the scrolling mechanic, like the shop system and I really appreciate the amount of strategy the game offers, even if that means the game becomes a bit draggy at times. I really think the game could have benefited from more chances to gain bellonium, because everyone would have wished to build a ship bristling with weapons but instead could only upgrade some here and some there. But then again this resembles resources scarcity not uncommon to a lot of other very good games.

A lot of really cool ideas.  As many others have already said, some of the execution is a miss.

I'd say overall they did a great job of getting the theme to the table, particularly with weapon upgrades and the natural feel of needing to maneuver through enemy fire and obstacles.

I think the trays are a bit of a let down.  I get why they built it the way they did, but visually it looks a little rough.

I really do like the game though, I think it is pretty cool.

The game really does a good job capturing the feel of playing a shmup.  Best when playing retro game music in the background.  I've really enjoyed it.

Having the ability to attack other players makes the game more interesting.

So far played it as a 2 & 3 player game.  Enjoyable with both player counts.  I must play with a lot of AP players because if I play again (especially with higher player counts) I busting out a timer.

My biggest issues are:

Disappointed in the quality of the trays
Box is a little too small once I organize the cards into baggies
Wish the character sheets/score board was made of thicker cardboard

Game sleeved with Ultra Pro Standard card sleeves and Mayday Mini Euro (the non premium ones, my Ultra Pro Mini Euro wouldn't fit in the tray.  Mayday sleeves work because they're thin enough to bend).

TBaKC delivers on its esoteric theme with a clever design. Although this faithful recreation of 2D shoot 'em ups replaces the nervous / twitchy of a video game with the methodical planning of a board game, it still provides a satisfying experience unlike any other game.

The game suffers from some component quality issues and some less than stellar scoring mechanisms, but is still worth a look if the theme interests you in the least.

RATING: 8
The way this game recreates the experience of an arcade shoot-'em-up like Galaga or Raiden is pretty remarkable. It's got everything you would expect to get from this sort of experience: power-ups, wipe-outs, bullet-hell, warp-zones, huge bosses and a race for the high score. And the game wraps it all up in a very welcome 8-bit art style with tons of character.

Despite Kemble's twitch-reflex roots, the underlying game mechanisms are actually surprisingly euro at their core. At first glance, you'd expect a game like this to be full of dice rolling and just sort of devolve into a random mish-mash of silliness. But that's not the case at all here. On the contrary, there are zero dice in this game and you've got to make your moves and choose your upgrades carefully.

And this brings me to the one and only potential drawback of this game: at higher player-counts, the game can become a victim of slow-down and be derailed by players with AP. To that end, I've devised a very simple house rule which I think helps return the fast-paced, seat-of-your-pants spirit to the experience. Set a 1 (or 2 if that's just too restricting for you) minute timer for each player's turn. If the player hasn't completed their actions before time is up, too bad. Since death in this game is really more of an inconvenience than anything truly punishing, getting scroll-pushed into an asteroid because you couldn't maneuver in time isn't a big deal.

There's really nothing else like this game and it is a surprisingly deep experience for those who are otherwise expecting a throw-away luck-fest.

Oh, and the game's money is called "bellonium". Classic.

Board game simulation of a competitive space shooter video game (personally reminds me of Galaga...I can hear the music in my head). Players move their ships about the scrolling board of hazards, meteors, and aliens to score points, earn beloved bellonium to buy power ups, and complete side missions. I like games that allow you to buy extra moves like this one does. I also like the threat system to resolve incoming fire. Big boss at the end. Good luck.

4 after 1 play.

Use of sensor cards to determine player order seems superfluous. Allowing weapons and upgrade cards to carry over to your new ship when your current one is destroyed is so illogical. Semi-coop part of the game also feels strange; if a player is out of the running, why should he/she help bring the boss down? Last but not least, computer games calculate hit points and damage quickly and does not carry over well into a board game.

I was worried this game would be gimmicky. I don't feel that it is. There's a lot of variety for replayability. Even if you fight the same boss twice, you won't necessarily be on the ground as you were the last time, because you won't know what boss to expect, or what weapons to focus on.

EDIT: we did not follow half of the rules, and played a much different game than we should have. I definitely skimmed the book.

Learned a few things after our first game: bought weapons are only used once per turn; you can only add one PvP cube to a player once per turn per player; and Shane thought he could Overcharge as long as he kept spending 2 energy to do it, though I'm not sure how often he was actually able to do it a third time.

If I have any real issues with the game, it's that the ships have very fine protruding details that make me worry they'll snap off; also, there is no good way to slide the rows down to scroll. The latter makes an awful noise, and picking them up to move them one-by-one seems like you'd be at risk of things moving around.

Otherwise, I like everything about this. I can't wait to fight the bigger bosses. I'd love an expansion to add more stuff.

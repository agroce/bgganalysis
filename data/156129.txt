GAME: Deception: Murder in Hong Kong
RANK: 170
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Played three times in quick succession, with that "one more time" feeling.
A lot of fun. A combo of mysterium, codenames and werewolf.
Being the murderer felt very exciting.
Being the forensic scientist must be like being the ghost in mysterium or clue master in codenames, but with the added battle of wits with the murderer.

RATING: 6
Different twist on the social deduction game; in this you receive clues and use those clues to find a killer while they (and their accomplice) try and throw you off. Less like ONUW outside of using (somewhat clueless) teams, I find it handles higher player counts much better than ONUW does in particular (and I think Deception needs at least 6, if not 8 or more to really work). It's much more solidly in the deduction category than any sort of bluffing. It's a game where I want a friend to own it more than I do (I can't justify buying it, but it's really enjoyable when it comes out). One concern I have is related to how well the murderer can plan for what item will be selected. Once a group gets a general understanding of the game, finding the killer ramps up in speed. There is some meta strategy related to being the killer and choosing your items that we don't have a handle on yet (likely because of how it's mechanically setup compared to Avalon/ONUW).

Deception, Murder in Hong Kong is an unusual social deduction game that uses word association cleverly as a core mechanic.  It is accessible, the games are fast, and it has been a hit with my non-gamer friends.   It creates some story and experiences that are memorable.

This is a good game about discovering the murderer (hidden role) using deduction rather than just accusing and feigning innocence. I don't think I'm a very good forensic scientist though - the one who provides the clues to the other players - so I start to feel a little incompetent. But it's fun.

Easy/beginner mode: Play according to game rules (murderer must choose both weapon and clue from the cards in front of themself).

Normal mode: Murderer must choose both weapon and clue from the same set/player, but can choose from *any* set/player (not just his/her own).  This variant allows the murderer to participate in the full game (with the "easy" version, once the murderer is identified, nobody cares what they say anymore, so they basically sit out the rest of the game).

Hard mode: Play all weapons and clues in the center of the table (you may want to reduce the total number of cards). The murderer may pick any weapon and clue on the table.

1st plays: Kindof disappointing, or else the game was a bit too easy for the good guys.  I played with 8 but it seemed like it was too hard to cover your tracks, and too easy to identify which clues go with which evidence.  We may need to increase the number of possible clues, or maybe less clue cards.  The theme is still cool though.

No 2nd play: Just too hard to get to the table and when I have the correct number of players for this game, there are other games I'd rather play.  In our experience it was too easy for the good guys (perhaps it's better with 6 tho).

Kickstarted. From the first few plays, it seems like it might be a little too easy for the Investigators, but it has high replayability and everyone was very into it.

After multiple plays, I still think the game is slightly unfavorable for the murderer, but adding 5 cards to each player seems to make it more balanced. It's a great game - I have yet to encounter anyone who didn't like it.

Fantastic social deduction game packed with loads of replayability. It's like an Avalon where players are actually able to start pointing fingers based on solid information. Works well with 5+ players.
The Witness and Accomplice roles really add to the experience. This one shines with gamers and non-gamers alike. Great for a variety of situations. Possibly my favorite party game. 
Comparisons WILL be made with Mysterium, but I'll pick Deception over "Meh"-sterium every time. Solid, solid party game.

Fantastic game that fires on all cylinders for our main gaming group. There are echoes of Mysterium, Codenames, One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Avalon/Resistance here, and I think this game is actually better than the latter two.

I've played it with 4, 5, 6 and 7 players so far and while unfortunately there are some situations where it is almost impossible to get our group to guess the murderer, the weapon and the evidence correctly I haven't had an experience I haven't enjoyed. I think for these numbers it is better to play the game in a vanilla state with only the forensic investigator, murderer and investigators.

My favorite hidden roles game for large groups. It beats out something like resistance because it gives you tangible ways to defend yourself with the various cards in front of you.

For me this completely replaces games like one night werewolf and a few others. It's a really solid implementation of a hidden role game with plenty of decisions on how to select your "instruments" or clues.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played without witness or accomplice.  Fills the "itch" that Mysterium has, but plays in a much shorter time frame.  I'd be a bit worried about the limitations of the "bullet" tiles where you can select. 

The added element of having a traitor (murderer) among the players works out much better thematically and is more interesting than identifying a murderer who is long dead.  

Tentative 8, possibly will go up with additional plays and trying out the witness/accomplice.

Great party game for 10 or more players.

Those are some hints for the investigators:
1. focus on what Forensic Scientist didn't choose.
2. beware the order of the hints.
3. make noise to cover the Witness.
4. always give logical speaks, don't make the others think you are the Accomplice, or even the Murderer.
5. give pressure on the maybe Murderer (or Accomplice) to make accusation against another maybe Murderer, in order to deduce the truth.

11/12/16: I think that this is a game that's not going to come out too often because you really need 5+ people to play.  That said it does it's job as a light party game.  You can explain it relatively quickly.  I can't shake the feeling that there are going to be some times when you are not going to be able to solve it, giving the murderer an auto-victory.  We'll see with more plays.

A very fun party game with lots of planning. It can be incredibly frustrating to be the investigator but that's part of the fun.

Essentially, this is Mysterium with a traitor mechanic. Like Mysterium, there is a silent player (forensic scientist) who acts as a game master. And each other player has a set of cards in front of them, which may correspond to the evidence/murder weapon used in the crime  Thing is, only one of the players is actually the murderer and none of the other players know who the murderer is. Thus, the forensic scientist tries to help the players deduce who the murderer is by selecting answers to clues that are drawn (the day of crime, the location of crime, etc). But as you can imagine, many of the answers can correspond to multiple cards and may have little to do with the scenario (red herring). And the murderer can talk like the other player, and will attempt to throw the other players off. 

Overall, I think I prefer this game to Mysterium. The clues in the game aren't as open-ended as Mysterium and the traitor mechanic adds an interesting twist. Still, this isn't a heavy deduction game that creates a lot of concrete information. Largely, the deductions are done through inference and intuition and the game feels more like a party/social game than a gamer's game. 

That being said, it's certainly a game I would play if I'm in the right mood. But in general, I gravitate towards heavier euros with more concrete information.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's a weird game that took a few games to comprehend. It's My crazy take: it's The Resistance meets a storytelling game, but where the storyteller is severally constrained by what they can tell the group, by selecting a few predetermined categories and hoping that the fellow investigators will understand what they mean.

And often ... they don't. As a game, it is massively biased against the investigators, especially at higher player counts. But as an experience, it's wonderful time.

I think for Deception to shine you really have to keep the player count down.  With too many this game falls flat.

That being said, I really like it.  Just with the right number of people.

Great social deduction game. Watching the other players trying to accuse each other can be both hilarious and frustrating for the forensic detective, when they are unable to get the hints. It's also pretty quick, so people tend to ask for another play, which says a lot about how good the game is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
Very interesting Mysterium semi-coop version, with no visual aspect but a very more elaborate clue-giving mechanism that makes it more thinky and imaginative. It all comes down to imagining the tale behind the clues, which compensates easily in my mind the lack of intricate Mysterium artwork. Definitely one to check, especially with the extra roles.

RATING: 7.9
This is a very well designed game that feels like a blend of mysterium and avalon.  I like that there is not much to teach and I like that it plays out quite different from avalon.  The accusation bit is somewhat boring and there is no real incentive to not wait till the end to do your accusation. Still great game.  Also depending on the clue card that comes up it could become much easier or harder for one side but that is ok.  Overall I do not think it reaches the highs of Avalon but is a compelling alternative.

Completely random guessing game where you have to make up stories in your mind and somehow expect that the game leader is thinking the same??? In our games that never happened, it's just blind guessing. One of the worst "games" I've played, together with Mysterium.

This game is a definite crowd-pleaser. It's a combination of Codenames and Avalon, but not quite as good as either of those. If you've exhausted playing those games too much and are looking for a new party game, this is a good choice. I've played it once with 11 players and found that was way too hectic. Groups of 5-6 have worked well, but the investigators have won every time. So I need to figure out how to balance the game more in the favour of the murderer.

Great fun! Played this 4 times back to back with Flo, my sister and my mom on New Years Eve. I really love this. It takes the Werewolf/Resistance style of game and turns it into something so much better. The role of the Scientist is fun to play but difficult as well. You have to put out clues that point to the way of the killing (easy) as well as the evidence (hard). It plays quickly (20 minutes or so) and gives the "just one more time" feel to it. This game might have me getting rid of games like ONUW, Resistance as well as Mysterium.

RATING: 7
Proof that as long as you have good ideas, no genre of anything can be over-saturated. Breathes new life into the werewolf/mafia concept, while supporting it's theme with amazing visuals and design. However, the bevy of items mixed with player's powers of persuasion can make finding the killer a tad overwhelming. Still a fun experience.

RATING: 7.25
A very fun party game, works well at all player counts and goes up to 12 players. There are some problems with the game, some of the categories that are on the clue cards especially the locations are not applicable to many items and the murderer will tend to choose similar items round after round. The game also seems a little unbalanced in favor of the detectives, even when extra cards are given out the murderer is often guessed in the first round.
That being said, my game group and I both enjoy this game and is one of our first choices for larger groups

This may easily become my favorite pure social deduction game.  It plays AMAZING in groups of 8 - 10 and is really good in groups of 4 or 5.

RATING: 7
A well put-together social deduction style game where one player is a forensic scientist and one is the murderer. The rest are investigating to find the murderer. The forensic scientist knows who the murderer is and a clue and weapon tying them to the crime. The scientist clues everyone into that by placing bullets on cards and the other players discuss. It makes for an interesting discussion where each investigator (and murderer looking like an investigator) provides their story of what happened. Each player gets one guess to identify the murderer with the single clue and single weapon tying them to the crime. In some ways this is better than Resistance because it generates a better story and explanations for why certain things are the way they are.

Note, this game is mediocre without using the optional witness and accomplice roles, which require at least 6 people. In this game, everyone has a hidden role and some cards showing murder weapons and evidence in front of them.  There are bystanders, a forensic scientist, and a murderer. The scientist is revealed and has everyone put their head down a la mafia style, then has the murderer awake and choose which cards in front of them are the murder weapon and evidence from his murder.The accomplice is also involved when in play. Then the murderer goes back down and the witness is shown the murder weapon and evidence, and thus the murderer. Then without talking, the scientist uses tiles to show different pieces of information on the murder weapon and evidence. For example the tile might say "the expression on the victim's face" with possible answers such as "frightened, surprised, scared, asleep, or uncrecognizable" and they must pick which description is best, without saying a word. If players think they know the correct evidence, they have 1 chance each to attempt top pick the correct cards. If they get it wrong, no is the answer (whether 1 of the 2 cards was correct or not). If they are right, they've almost won, then the murderer and accomplice try to pick out the witness and if they pick right, they still win. 

Mostly a social game, the fun in this game comes from including the witness, and the struggle of the witness to get the group to get to the right answer without making it so obvious that they get snuffed out.

Two plays, one as investigator, one as murderer.

Resistance never really sat well with me. It felt very close to just throwing random accusations, which is fine (I like Werewolf) but with a bit of unsatisfactory "deduction". I used quotes there because it didn't feel like you were deducting anything concrete, and besides the game was too short, and not enough discrete actions in the game, to have your "deductions" matter in time to affect the game. (I completely accept that that's likely just me being bad at the game.)

One Night Werewolf was fine, not necessarily better, but shorter and more random. I could go in knowing that I probably won't be figuring anything out, and just do it as a silly filler and have a laugh at the seemingly-random result. But the roles and the interactions were just a tiny bit too fiddly for what I was trying to use it for.

Deception to me is better than both of those games in all important ways. It'll be full of accusations, but they're not totally random, they're reasoned based on the vague clues you have. The different roles are limited, keeping the game simple and keeping the core of the game lighter and more accessible. And I like the vague clues the forensic scientist player is forced to give, which is a unique twist to this genre and really adds a more real feeling of deduction that is lacking with a lot of the other games of this type.

Can drag with large groups. The moderator / forensic scientist needs to keep the game moving. I also suggest choosing a forensic scientist instead of randomly assigning -- not everyone's going to like sitting out on the "fun" of the deduction.

Very good hidden roles game where one player is trying to lead the others to guess a set of cards (murder weapon/method and piece of evidence) but he cannot speak and instead communicates by giving clues from lists of possibilities.  Another player is the murderer and tries to lead them astray without being too obvious.  Needs a few more plays with more players, but quite fun.

M̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶d̶a̶t̶a̶ ̶r̶e̶q̶u̶i̶r̶e̶d̶, this one hit with a group of heavier gamers for a few games, but I do think it will really hum with a lighter crowd. Also: must play it with more than 6, seems that more people is where this one is at.

EDIT: Wow I've played this game a lot in the last few months. This to me feels like the true successor to The Resistance. I love the theme, it handles a larger group WAY better than The Resistance does, and it naturally injects story into the game by making everyone connect the dots, rather than force everyone to roleplay their missions to avoid the game just feeling abstract. Won't ever reach for other Resistance successors like Secret Hitler over this again honestly. Not as amazing with heavier gamers, but for everyone else, non-gamers included, a slam dunk.

Another game of high hopes and great disappointments.
The idea sounds awesome: Mysterium meets Social Deduction.

I still like the idea but the way this game tries to implement it just isn't enough for me.
You get a bunch of clues, discuss, one more clue, discuss, one last clue. A round lasts 15-20 minutes. And that's it.

If you have the bad luck that your cards in front of you fit the hints because the loudest person misunderstood some of the hints then the round is close to lost. Most of the time your fellow investigtors focus so hard on you that they don't see the other things on the table...and you can say whatever you want.

Something is missing to make this game more complete...but I can't tell...yet.

First couple of plays, 6p. One murderer. I think groups need to start with smaller numbers (4-6) with one murderer to get the hang of it. Then, when people are more familiar, and the forensic scientist understands the game and how to "clue", you can introduce more players and/or the accomplice/witness.

Looking forward to more plays.

I am not at all a fan of hidden traitor, deduction, or bluffing-type games in general, but this one didn't strongly feel of any of those things.

I liken it more to a game like Unusual Suspects where clues are being given, and it's up to the players to interpret those clues to narrow down the field of options. The only difference here is that one player is the bad guy, trying to steer everyone else the wrong way, rather than it being fully cooperative.

Overall a fun party game/activity if your guests don't mind some of the darkness of the game.

There is almost no game to this. Its like a 30 minute discussion leading to one guess. Poorly implemented system. Could've been better with a little more thought into the design. There's a lot of people waiting for something to happen, and I've played it 5 times now and its never an exciting finish. It doesn't get more strategic. There's just nothing to the game except somebody chooses two random cards. You get a few vague hints and you have to guess which cards were chosen, You only get one guess and you have to discuss it with the group for what feels like forever, because there really isn't any game play. There are plenty of better party games that have more going on. All this has is pretty looking components.

Extremely interesting combination of social deduction (Resistance) with clue interpretation (Mysterium/Codenames).  It takes the best of both elements and packs it into a short and delicious experience that is memorable on each play.  

I do think it's much better with 6+ and using the included optional roles that mimic Merlin/Assassin from Avalon.  Positively sublime this way.

This is the game that Mysterium thought it was/wanted to be/what I thought it was supposed be...  Just in case my disappointment with Mysterium was my own fault...  BUT I have had so much fun playing this game.  The frustration of being Forensic Scientist and not having people understand you, the confusion of being an investigator, the subterfuge of being an Accomplice, and the sneakiness of being the "murderer".  Just missing being the Witness.  I think this is the game that fits just about any group (of 6 plus people).  If I was to mark it down, it would simply that there aren't enough Means of Murder cards.  I think there should be as many of these as there are clue cards, hopefully this gets rectified soon.

Excelente juego de deducción y engaño. Es un poco dependiente de la suerte porque hay veces que a uno le tocan muy buenas cartas para despistar y otras en las que son tan únicas que a la primera los demás aciertan con el asesino y el arma.
Me gusta que no hay eliminación de jugadores como en el Ultimate Werewolf. Sin lugar a dudas este es uno de los nuevos favoritos en la categoría de juegos de grupo.

It's the demon love child of One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Mysterium, and Codenames. With an awesome L.A. (Read Hong Kong) Noir theme layered over it. It has all the fun of association of Mysterium, but you can play it in 10 minutes. I really enjoy Deception. Plenty of plays to come. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yeah, this is a good one. Honestly? I think this is might be the best social deduction game for people who don't like social deduction.

Because while you can make some assumptions off of people's behavior, this game has much, much more game information to take into account. The focus is really not on bluffing, and the game is not at all accusatory (while still  being highly social). The focus is on solving the mystery, so even if you're the "bad guy" you don't feel on edge and threatened in the way you do in your typical Werewolf/Resistance kind of game.

And, most importantly, the puzzle is just plain fun to solve. If you've played Concept, it will feel familiar. 

The only thing in this game that gives me any sort of pause is that unlike similar games where you're dealing with either concepts or clues that are vaguer than the concreteness of words (say, Mysterium's vision cards), it does feel like winning and losing can come down to what clue tiles your Forensic Investigator draws. Still, in a 15-20 minute game where you're likely to play a few games in a row before giving it a rest, it doesn't really bother me too much.

Oh and HUGE PROPS to this game for scaling so well. Seriously, I've played with everywhere from 4-10 and it works well at all counts. The low count games have a very different feel from the high count games, but the key word there is [i]different[/i] - not really better or worse. The only thing I'd say is, with a 4p game you really need to use 5 cards per person instead of 4.

I really hope this gets the love it deserves. 2015 was a stellar year for party games and this one came out pretty late, but I think it's just as worthy of consideration as the heavy hitters like Codenames and Mysterium.

PPS: As a fan of bluffing games, I really like playing with the Witness role!

RATING: 5
This is a social deduction/bluffing game that has flown under the radar, but I think you should take a look at it if you enjoy games like The Resistance and Concept as it’s sort of a mix between those games. You’re investigators who need to find out which of you is actually the killer. One player, the forensic chemist, knows who that is and tries to give clues to the other players who it is. Each player has four “means” card as well as four “clue” cards in front of them, for instance a cell phone, a rose, some rope, perfume etc., and while the other players close their eyes, the murderer selects two of these and shows to the FC, who will then have to try to give clues about these two objects. But the tricky part is the way this is handled… Because the FC draws a couple of placards with 6 words on them, for instance “summer/winter/autumn/spring/day/night” or “pieces/clefts/ashes/water stain/disorderly/tidy” (there are a ton of cards and they vary a lot). So if the murderer chose drowning and a rose, it is not that hard to point to summer and water stain – but another person might be sitting with cards which can also be directly related to those clues, making it not too obvious. 

Also, you can get royally screwed by these placards as it is almost impossible to extract any meaningful clues out of some of them. If the murderer chose lipstick, and you get a card with the seasons, it’s not going to be easy… And of course the murderer will have to try and shift attention away from himself and try to convince that it must be THAT player instead of him… Still, every player needs to be very aware of the order in which the FC places his clues; what he feels is the best is placed first, so the last or second last clue might not mean a lot. 
When you draw placards randomly and play with a lot of players, it’s actually quite hard to win because there are so many possibilities. And even if you’re fairly sure who the murderer is, each person still only has one shot to uncover the murderer and you need to guess both the means and the clue card!

In my opinion it’s not as good as Resistance/ONUW/many other social bluffing/deduction games, but I do like the mix of those games and Concept (as the Forensic Chemist, which is a great role by the way, tries to give clues and hints only by placing pawns on the placards, but not by saying or doing anything else). My family enjoyed it a lot! I’ve tried it with 4-6 players, and personally I like it better with fewer players as it’s easier, but there are rules for adjusting the difficulty. Also, there are additional roles (some of them which reminds me of Avalon) if you’re playing with 6+ players, and I could see it being an interesting experience with 9-10 players. Oh, and the game takes like 20 minutes to play, which is a huge plus in my book for this kind of game!

Very good deduction game that lends itself to creative story-telling.  Variety of roles, none of which feel superfluous.

Social deduction with a logical puzzle, highly enjoyable.
When it works it's amazing but can sometimes fall flat without a decent murderer. I also wouldn't recommend at the maximum player count due to the sheer amount of cards.

Very good social deduction game.  In our first 5 games, we found it pretty easy to discern the murderer, clue and method while in the 5th game we failed.  Some of it comes down to luck of the cards, but if the murderer is careful and observant of his/her opponents, they can shape the difficulty of the game with wise choices of their method and clue cards.  We also played with only 5 people.  I would imagine things become more difficult as the count increases.  Looking forward to more plays.

Group deduction game.  One person is the spy who points to a two cards in from of them.  There a mute narrator who manipulates tokens on a board to help the other players figure out who the murderer is.  Kind of a mix of Codenames and Mysterium.

RATING: 7
Great game with 4-6 Players so far, lots of intrigue and some inspired guess work. 

Doesn't appear to work so well with more than 6 at the moment, but it may just be a case of working to make the cards more visible to a bigger group.

When a game looks so fascinating that I take time to make my own Norwegian version , you know there`s got to be something to it. (Bought the real McCoy later though)

Excellent deduction game that mixes hidden roles and
lots of social interaction. Like everything about this game and the production value is magnificent.

Mysterium without the intricate pictures.  In place of vague pictures you get vague words.  Can still be fun.  One player is actively working against you, which is different than mysterium.  

Why I got rid of it: I would like to pay it again.  It went over well with groups. Kinda long for a social deduction game for me.

Plays better with more people; it's a bit simple with only 4 players. Good mix of social game with some deduction/storytelling.  I feel that it's a bit weighted towards the investigators.  The murderers rarely seem to win in our group.  Maybe we are all just bad at bluffing!

RATING: 7
My favorite Resistance-like game to date. Having a concrete base of (often ambiguous) information to work from made all the difference.

Playing the Forensic Scientist felt a little bit like being spymaster in Codenames, in a good way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Components: Fun images on all the various means/clue cards. The cards and tiles are made much more difficult to read by the inclusion of Chinese characters. Not sure if the intent was theme or a dual-language release, but it really clutters up the cards; especially when trying to read from across the table or upside down.

Experience: As the forensic scientist, I find it challenging to concoct a consistent and sensible narrative of the crime. As an investigator, I like that it is part deduction, trying to interpret the clues; and part social deduction, trying to read people's reactions. As the murderer, it's challenging to pick means and clues that are both incongruous with each other, and as similar as possible to other means and clues on the table; I don't like having to deflect attention from myself.

Simple deduction game with someone being deceptive to cover their tracks. This game plays better at higher numbers but if you only have 4-5, then play Mysterium.

Four cards in front of each player of weapons and clue. Murderer picks items. Forensic scientist can't talk, puts tokens on descriptor words. Each person gets 30 seconds to say what they think happened. Trying to guess both correct. Similar to Mysterium.

Un jeu en provenance de Hong Kong maintenant. Pour des parties de 2 à ... 12 joueurs !! De quoi remplir les gros groupes de joueurs lors des soirées bien remplies ! En plus, c'est un jeu un peu à la loup garou. Il y a eu un meurtre qu'il va falloir élucider. Chaque joueur a un rôle caché (investigateurs/villageois ou meurtrier/loup garou). Les investigateurs vont devoir trouver les preuves irréfutables du meurtre. Le meurtrier va essayer de les induire en erreur. Tout cela sous l’œil du médecin légiste. Les quelques tables que j'ai vu tourner à Octogone semblaient bien s'amuser. A essayer, donc ! En fait, je me dis que ce jeu être plus proche de "la rose noire" que les loups garous (mais ça reste le même type de jeu)

Pour 2 à12 investigateurs  pour des parties de 30 minutes

Have enjoyed this quite a bit since our first game, although we added a rule.  The first time we played the murderer chose some things that made no sense together and we came nowhere close to solving the crime. Since then, we have require the murderer to come up with some kind of story to link the items. That makes it a bit more interesting for the investigators, who are forced to talk through what happened. Might be a bit too easy that way though...

Played it for the first time yesterday and have experience with games like "Codenames", Mysterium, Dixit, Resistance.

The absolute best hidden role/deduction party game. Open options for those to bold face lie, stay calm and quiet, or loudly work out the clues. Could possibly suffer from a quarterback player, but can be controlled by limiting player talking time and not allowing interruptions. One of the few games most people should have in their collection.

Only thing stopping it from being a ten is component quality. Could be a bit higher and some of my investigator badges have changed color over time and a few red cards as well. Could not find any evidence elsewhere of moisture or water damage so I have no idea what caused the change.

One of our most played games. It's super simple to setup and teach with a great theme. Anyone that has played Clue will instantly understand what's going on. It's always a hit.

I will say that the game lacks a decent structure so we've house ruled how each round works. Also the game in our group is way too easy so we have everyone with a total of 10 clues in front of them instead of 8. Even at 10 we've found that it can still be fairly easy to figure out who the murder is unless the Forensic Scientist is just awful. We may eventually bump it up to 12 per person.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This was an instant hit, and fast favorite of mine.  The simple fact that it can accommodate up to 12 players is a huge bonus since there are very few games I own that do work with large groups.  I do want to point out that it didn't work very well with 4 players, although 5 and 6 seemed to work OK.  The more the merrier!  The gameplay is very fast, which is another huge plus.  I love the mix of social and logical deduction, where you can purely focus on the clues given by the forensic scientist, or you can pay close attention to how each player is acting to try and figure out who the murderer is.  But most often, it is a mix of those two that will be the most help.  Even playing with someone that usually HATES games that involve lying, they were pleasantly surprised at how much they enjoyed this game, even when they did end up being the murderer.  I highly recommend this game, and can see this being played very often in the future.

I just played this yesterday and it was a lot of fun. If you're the murderer, you should try to pick your two cards with as much overlap between  other players, or even just one player, as possible. It makes it much more fun when you can, as the murderer, just slide any accusation at you to any other player just as easily. I like this one a lot!

Played this three times last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Brings a breath of fresh air to the hidden role genre.

Social deduction games aren't my favorite genre, but this one is better than average.  This is because the clues guide the discussions in a logical fashion, as opposed to random, baseless accusations which drag down many of the games in this family (Werewolf, The Resistance, etc.).    This adds a Clue element to the discussion which works quite well.   The art is a bit dark and muted and a little hard to see across the table.   The Chinese printing gets in the way a little bit, so I'm not sure that flavor is helping anything.

"Oh, you mean like Clue?"... That's the one thing everyone says when I introduce this game. The answer: Well... kinda. You are attempting to determine who the murderer was and what the 'means of murder' and 'evidence' left behind was. You have one guess, use it wisely. The HOW is completely different than clue. The 'Forensic Scientist' knows who the murder is and gives clues to everyone by silently placing clue tokens on tiles (think Mysterium or Dixit-esque). One of my favorite party games when we have 6+ players!

My favorite social deduction game, by far. I was well burnt out on it (played more games of Resistance than I can count and Werewolf was a popular favorite night-ender when my game-group was at its peak.) Since, most of them have been exhausting minor variations on the system.

Everything about Deception is perfect. The limitations on the detective are hilariously harsh and makes for so many far-out theories on what they're trying to say. Since the detective has generally come up with a 'story' to come up with their answers, players will throw out all kind of crazy tales about how the crime took place.

I can't imagine getting sick of this game. I wish I were playing it right now.

One player is the detective. The murderer identifies himself to the detective in an eyes closed session. The game plays out with all of the players, including the murderer (who plays along in a deceiving role), having to work out who the murderer is via clues given by the detective.

It plays fast (10 mins max), and is a refreshing change from werewolf/resistance games.

Awesome game which combines the Resistance: Avalon, DixIt, Mysterium, Codenames and Clue. It rejuvenated social deduction stalemate situation in my gaming group. It is fun playing as any role. It seems that it goes a bit in the favor of the investigators instead of the murderer but I am going to confirm that soon.

2017-08-26 : First play. Social deduction game that is a bit fragile - for lack of a better word - it is very dependent on what cards are out there in what combination so even the cleverest play can be all for naught. Getting the right combination of roles for the number of players is also hugely important - in our 6-player games having both an accomplice and a witness meant that even when the investigators got it right, there's a 33% chance they'll lose - which the rules allow, but really shouldn't.

Deception is as many people have described: a combination of Mysterium and Resistance. It's a bit similar to Mysterium in that you have a silent protagonist who's trying to feed restrained clues to the investigators to solve the murder. The Resistance connection comes from the fact that one of the players is actually the murderer who is trying to throw the other players off his track. When you add the additional roles (2 seem to be a direct copy of Merlin and the Assassin), it's even closer to the Resistance. In The Resistance it's easier for the Spies to win, so the Merlin/Assassin combo feels like overkill. Since the murderer has a tougher time in this game, it seems like a good balancing mechanism. Without adding those roles, I'd almost consider adding more Clue/Means cards per player.

It's quick (quicker than the resistance), easy to teach, accommodates a large range of players, and is just generally a fun game to play. In addition, people who dislike lying may find more to like here since every player is doing the same thing: showing why there are connections between other player's cards and the clues given by the Forensic Scientist.

SOLD IT! ($18)

In theory I like what the game is trying to accomplish, but the main guessing element is so loose I felt I was guessing at clues. Little info changes between rounds and I wish more happened at this point. It is of course the sort of game that succeeds or fails with the blend of folks playing with you.

It is quick and intuitive which is how all games in this category need to be.

Mysterium meets Resistance, as player assume hidden-roles and try to oust the murderer/accomplice based on somewhat abstract clues from the mute forensic scientist. There isn't much structure to the game, which helps facilitate the discussion and debate amongst the players. I prefer Mysterium, but given it's surprisingly quick play time, it lends itself more to the filler space anyway.

Impossible for me to talk about this game without referring to Mysterium. Mysterium was Clue meets Dixit, so I guess Deception is Mysterium meets The Resistance.

In Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, players find themselves in a scenario of intrigue and murder, deduction and deception. One player is the murderer, secretly choosing their weapon and the evidence they leave behind. Another is the forensic scientist who holds the key to convicting the criminal but is only able to express their knowledge through analysis of the scene. The rest are investigators, interpreting the clues to solve the crime and the killer is among them. Plays 4-12.

This is much like Mysterium, with (at least) one traitor, that plays much faster and is therefore easier to explain, set up, and finish.

I haven’t played many other games with traitors (Werewolf, Resistance), but after playing this and Saboteur, I realise I dislike the lying, not because I’m terrible at it or because I dislike deceiving people on principle, but because so many people are terrible at it and I find it’s generally too easy to figure out who’s lying. 

More than that even, it’s the resulting unpleasant knowledge of who among my friends and acquaintances is particularly good at lying and who isn’t. For whatever reason, this makes me uncomfortable and so I don’t have a lot of fun with these games. The more I play them, the less I have to say while playing.

(I also find it’s too easy to work backwards into why the FS would choose certain hints over others — unless the FS is a teenager.)

However, many people seem to enjoy these traitor games and I will have to play them more than I’d like, so if I were to choose, I would likely choose this one because of the theme and general openness of play.

My rating is high because I think the game works well overall and everyone else I’ve played it with has thoroughly enjoyed it and wanted to play it over and over. Great with 6+ player groups, especially with those who don’t enjoy other types of “thinky” games.

Interesting cleudo like concept however there seem to be too many clues as it is almost impossible for the murderer to get away. 
I think it will shine with the full compliment of players, where the accomplice and the witness are included but it feels unpolished with 5 players.

A cross between Mysterium and Werewolf, with the investigators trying to solve a murder that one of them committed and one player being the silent clue giver. Works fine, and since it's over quickly one can forgive that both the murderer and the clue giver only have very limited means to influence the investigation.

Different aspects of the game design are ill-suited for both larger, and smaller, groups.  There's a great little party game hidden nestled in here somewhere; unfortunately, the game as currently designed just doesn't work very well.  And with larger groups, most of the game is simply circuitous talk and very little actual gameplay.

This is one of the best party games in our collection. 

It has classic yet elegant deduction and bluff mechanisms. - - It is encouraging everyone to speak up, with breaks when every investigator gets to talk the rest of the group through his/her story.
- It is focusing the conversation on the police case with tangible thematic evidences.
- It plays very well with imaginative people who come up with great funny stories explaining why the assassin killed her victim in an elevator with a hook and hid the evidence in a teddy bear.

One of the downsides of this game, I find, is the pace. The first round is pacy but then we get to add only one card at a time and pause, three times.. and there is little incentive to burn your ticket and go all-in with an accusation, meaning the game can drag a bit..

Easily the best social deduction game I've played. Somehow the game drives a really good time of debate.  I've played at 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 players and it's much better at 6+ players when you can use all roles.

I really wanted to like this game.  I still do really want to like it.  It has some really bad balance issues though, and it is almost impossible to win as the bad guys.  I have played with varied groups and varied player counts.  We have tried a few house rules to try to fix it, but to no avail.  Good simply always wins with the groups that I play with.  It isn't because the murderer is picking bad items.  It isn't because the murderer and accomplice don't try to muck the game up.  The options just get narrowed down too quickly regardless of what you pick.  If the game was balanced and the win rates were anywhere near split 50/50 between good and bad, I would love this game.  Unfortunately, it is no where near 50/50.

Nice, light social deduction game. Not sure it has a ton of replay, but there are probably enough cards for many games. Rules are pretty easy, although it relies on shared social contract for how to enforce. Overall, seemed hard for the investigators in my very limited experience.
The social deduction is very straight-forward. For one-night werewolf, you need to be aware of how the characters inter-relate to lie believably. This one, you can simply work covertly without much thought. With the optional roles for larger groups, it's a little more complex.

EDIT: Actually, what the game needed was more players. 2 more card per player doesn't dilute the pool of suspects enough, but a fresh set of 8 cards can make a huge difference. Also, the witness and accomplice roles are fun to play with. So this game is a 9 for 8+ players and a 7 for fewer.

EDIT: After playing a few more times, it's become clear that it's far too easy to find the murderer, even with 5 cards. Because of this I've reduced my rating. It's still a fun game, just not as tense or interesting.

I've only played the forensic scientist, but it was really interesting! There's a plenty to think about as the scientist and it's a lot of fun to listen to people misinterpreting your clues and later removing those same clues. The cards that give hints to the investigators are all interesting and I've been able to justify all of my picks so far, even though they're seldom obvious. I'm not sure about the murderer role, it seems to play just like the others as you're never suspicious of yourself anyway. It's necessary to make sure the cards picked are hard for the scientist, but it seems like a boring role to have. 

I've heard people describe this as Mysterium with a traitor, but I think it's simply just a variant on Mysterium. Which is fine because I love Mysterium, but I would have liked for the traitor to be able to do more. Perhaps with the built-in variants that part of the game will open up more.

Overall it's a smartly designed game with interesting choices and discussion. I like how it forces people to talk and listen equally.

Very very fun thematic game. The investigators are really trying to find the murderer. Plays well with accomplice and witness. When playing alot of people (10+) I would suggest taking out 1 means of murder and 1 clue card, it would be too hard. Also, we just decided on giving the forensic scientist to someone who's smart enough to point good clues :p. The kickstarter edition comes with the consulting detective. The only bad side i would say is not having many roles for the investigators.

Great hidden identity game. Has similar elements to codenames with word association. I have to admit I was expecting it to be better. There was a lot of hype and anticipation surrounding this game that lead me to believe it was going to be a masterpiece. And don't get me wrong it's a good game it's staying in my collection and I'm sure it will see regular play, but when we finished the first game it was one of those "thats it? Oh. Okay." Moments. I would still suggest this game for many reasons, it's just the hype sort of tainted the experience for me.

A solid item in the "enigmatic clues" genre (Codenames, Mysterium). I could see the murderer/witness elements being excruciating with people who actually just want to play Werewolf, but there's plenty enough game to just play without getting personal if you want to.

Can get a little gruesome if you think too hard about the murder weapon cards.

This game is always a hit.  Whether it is with family or friends, the mildly macabre conversations that ensue are always delightful.

A fun party game with a light secret agent/traitor element. Cards give very little information, but it is fun discussing how each piece of evidence can align with potential clues and leads. Hidden role element has a lower focus than some contemporaries. Gives a lower stakes feel that works for the game. The clues also do a good job of immediately giving players something to discuss and avoids some of the early game deduction issues from similar games.

A good social game. Everything is on cards so you don't have to come up with your own choices as in SpyFall or Dixit.Might be a little dull though based on the cards in front of you, it's often one of two cases, you don't have any specifc so everything falls in the same category or you have a unique combo that no one else has.

This game may well get a 9 eventually. Everytime I play it, it moves up in my esteem.

I really like the theme and players (especially non-gamers) really enjoy the "murderer is amongst us" aspect. 

The problem can be with players who are terrible at lying, they can be very obvious, then if your group puts pressure on them, they blush like a goldfish, so you know who the murderer is. Then it is just a simple deduction game of finding the right pair or murder weapon and clue.

With experienced players however, it becomes much much more interesting.

I think part of this bad rating was the hyped expectation i had going in there.
I was hoping this would replace ONUW or Avalon of some sort.
I expected way more table talk about how the murder took place, but that ain't gonna happen. There's just no point to argue, "i think blunt weapon means hammer" "well i think blunt weapon means shovel" so..?
And that's the main part of the game. There's nothing else much.

As a normal investigator you're pretty clueless and mostly take a shot in the dark. If the murderer is clever he chooses two things that don't fit together at all (wich doesn't make for a good story btw).
The clue giver is okay i guess, but really interesting seems only the role of the murderer itself.

My group was unimpressed.

I really like the concept of Concept with a Theme. However, even though there were laughs to be had, sometimes, having such diverse items and key evidence really stumps the conversation. Maybe my group just ain't that good at storytelling, those moments really mar the game.

There are times when the laughs and stories are just great! I don't know how many more I can get of them though. Hanging on to these for awhile more to see if it turns for the better. Maybe adding in the event variants will help.

I like Deception so far, but I haven't played it much or with high player counts. I have found in some games that the clues you can offer as the Forensic Scientist are wildly misleading, and there's little you can pick that's useful. Maybe that's thematic, and I can see that being mitigated at higher player counts where there are other roles in play. It's not really a fault of the game, but I mostly got this game as a social game to replace Avalon (for people who don't like the chaos or lying). It turns out that the theme is more unsettling to some people than I thought it would be, so I've actually mostly enjoyed the game with other gamers.

Tried with two different groups: one group enjoys heavier games, and most of the players did not find the game too interesting. The second group leans towards light to medium games, including social/party games, and that group loved it - played it three times in a row.

With the right group, this one can be a hit. I really do like the fact that this is quite different from all the other short hidden identity/traitor games out there on the market today that I have played (mafia/werewolf, the Resistance, Who is the Traitor?, Mayday Mayday!, Saboteur, Lifeboat). I would say this game is more socially oriented than all of them except for mafia/werewolf.

Game interest level depends on the creativity of the forensic scientist, otherwise unfortunately it will not be able to hold a candle compared to other hot favourites like Avalon/Resistance in terms of social deduction. 

Too much unnecessary details and brain energy wasted in going over distracting clues/evidence etc while it does occasionally make the game interesting, kills it eventually.

This game is refreshing and really makes you feel like the smartest guy in the room. It's really just exciting discussing the different thought processes everyone goes through. My biggest gripe with this game is the size. It fills so many check boxes, it's fun, different, and it's fast! BUT. Man this box is big. And there are so many other party games that can just fit in your backpack or you can put in a tiny canvas bag to go. Deception is just so big it feels like a hassle to bring to a board game meetup when I'd rather take a 1-2 euro with high replay-ability instead. Other deception games scratch a similar itch but they are so much lighter. Overall, great game, I wish I could play more but when I'm bringing three games to game night and other people have party games this one just falls behind.

6p, 7p, 8p, 9p or 10p? A social-deduction game with hidden traitors. Similar to Mysterium and The Resistance. Video 81430 shows a 4-player session with no excitement, but youtu.be/IXGUP3apjM0 shows two 7-player sessions with excitement. The accomplice seems to be a vital role, and it seems that 6+ players are needed to have an accomplice (/article/24754129#24754129).

We played Deception with 8-9 people, and it just didn't work. We may try again with less, but I wasn't too inspired by our first night. With that many cards on the table, and the vague-at-best clues provided by the draw, it was nearly impossible to narrow things down as a player. The game also needed, IMO, some mechanics to help the Forensic Scientist really commit the correct answer to memory, and to give them a chance to observe the field before diving in to the proceedings. I noticed how hard it was for the Forensic Scientist to try and study the correct answer before clue giving, without making it obvious he/she was doing so.

I really just don't get the appeal of these short, condensed social deduction games. With so little information to go on I feel like you lose too much of the deduction, and it becomes just social. I can't imagine ever choosing this over Resistance, whose length allows for actual information to become available and thus actual deduction to happen.

I've only played this game in groups of 5 and maybe it would get an even higher rating if I played it with more.  The game is like Mysterium in that there is one character (in this game, randomly assigned) who doesn't talk or gesticulate, but is the one who knows the murder and most offer clues.  The clues involve setting tokens on terms on the board that involve the murder, which connect to some of a larger set of clues that each player/suspect has in front of them.  If the clue giver doesn't have a lot to work with--and the murderer is supposed to choose clues that don't leave much to work with--then the discussion can fall a little flat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very group dependent, like most social deduction games. It also has a tendency to end anticlimactically now and then, because the forensic scientist draws the perfect clue.

Having bad vision makes playing it a little annoying, since I sometimes have to walk around the table to see the tiny clue cards.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2015)

When I bought the game, I had no idea it was a party game in the vein of Mysterium and The Resistance: Avalon. In fact, it is a mix of those 2 games and I feel the end product is a good deduction game. One of my favorite mechanism is Hidden Roles so I’m naturally inclined to like the game.

The rules are dead easy and can be explained under 3 minutes. The game components are ok but I feel the game is a bit expensive for the quality/quantity of the components. I acquired in on Kickstarter and I now see they are selling it $5 less than I paid, however I have some promo cards so I guess it is ok!

As usual in these kind of games, it is way more fun to have a role in the game (Murderer, Forensic Scientist, Accomplice, etc.) but as the playtime is rather short I don’t mind much.

On the bad side, in each of our plays, it was DEAD EASY to identify the murderer. I dislike this as there wasn’t really any way for the murderer to deflect attention away from him. Perhaps this was due to the fact that we were only 6 players, but still it bothers me a bit. On the Resistance you can always accuse other players, but here it is very obvious you cannot do that to great success because the Key evidence and the Means of Murder are clearly seen by everyone. The luck of the clues can be overpowering, one of our games ended very quickly and the murderer couldn’t do a thing. I need to play the game with more players to see if these issues disappears.

Bottom line, the idea of the game is great and I want to play it again soon. However, for me it doesn’t replace Mysterium or The Resistance Avalon (both games are superior IMO). I need to verify that the game isn’t too easy for the investigators, but it looks this way due to the luck factor and the lack of tools for the murderer to deflect attention. Identifying the murderer is very easy, but identifying both cards (Key Evidence and Means of Murder) is not that easy. I will keep it in my game collection for now and I enjoy the game tremendously, thus the high rating.

I finally played the game with more people and I still like and enjoy the game, however in EVERY game the killer has been correctly identified and that bothers me. The few times the killer was able to win was because he correctly identified the witness.

Deception also comes with event tiles (which I haven’t used) but I read them and they help the investigators even more. I feel the game is way unbalanced against the killer and accomplice.

I have played Deception: Murder in Hong Kong a lot this year and I’m enjoying it tremendously. I have played with many diverse people and I found that many times the bad guys win so I no longer have this issue. Besides you could easily increase the game difficulty adding or reducing cards and I think it is an official variant. I’m upgrading its rating.

Concept meets Clue. Interesting idea but limited options severely constrain the clue giver. Murder's role is also somewhat limited as are his or her opportunities to mislead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun hidden bad person (people, actually) game somewhere between Mysterium and Resistance. One person knows who the bad guys and gives clues as to who they are to the others by choosing words from lists (the Mysterium bit), while the other players 'debate' who the bad guys are based on those clues (the Resistance bit).

Prefer it to both of the games I've referenced. The clues are verbal rather than graphic. (I like words, and I find the graphic element in Mysterium very random - just keep guessing, you'll get there in the end). There is at least something to go on when debating who are the bad guys - with the wrong group, Resistance disintegrates into a loud, never-ending squabble between the pushier players.

RATING: 8.5
- This game is pretty fun, that can be really fun with the right crowd, but either way is very versatile and generally liked by most people.
- Great player-count and age range.
- Easy to teach.
- Can be played relatively quickly if someone helps keep the game moving by prompting players, etc. This can be done by the Forensic Scientist without compromising play.
- It can be a great alternative to games like the Resistance for people that don't like to lie, as there's scope for everyone to act a bit suspect, and people generally don't get interrogated in the same way they do in the Resistance.
- This game benefits significantly from sledging and players that like to role-play a little. The plays really can make or break this game.
- I prefer this game with 6+ players, with the Accomplice and Witness included. It's fun for players to speculate who the Accomplice and Murder are, and the Witness helps to speed the game up as Witness usually helps steer people in the right direction, and the Murder knows they have a second chance if they get found out.

In this game, each player is given four murder weapons and four clues, which they lay face-up in front of them. Players are also handed secret identities. One of these identities is a murderer. Another player plays the "Forensic Scientist". Much like the man-behind-the-screen in Mysterium, the Forensic Scientist is to give clues to the other players to help them guess the identity of the murderer. Before beginning, everyone closes their eyes while the murderer reveals himself to the scientist and indicates the weapon and the left-behind clue from among the eight cards in front of him. The Scientist then uses cards, some are the same every game but some are randomly drawn, to give hints to the other players as to what the correct weapon and clue are. Players openly discuss the possibilities in a structured format called a "monologue". If three rounds of monologues pass with no player guessing the correct weapon and clue, the murderer wins. Each round, the scientist can change one hint. This game is especially fun if everyone gets into the spirit and makes up wild stories of murder as their monologues, which are essentially a cool way of marrying sometimes improbable combinations of murder weapons and clues. Players can guess at any time, but each player only gets one guess.

Maybe it was us, but we played four games and each time the murderer was found either right after, or even before, the first monologue round. This game could get dull quickly if it is always this easy. I'd like explore it further. I'm sure you can always reduce the number of hints given to make it harder and maybe that's what I'll have to do next time. Jury's a bit out on this one, but the first go around was a good time!

[floatleft][ImageID=2575504][/floatleft]I played as the forensic scientist (FS) once and as the murderer once. This is a one against many game with asymmetric roles. One player is the FS and another the murderer, all other players are investigators (at least at 4p, there are other roles with more players). The investigators are trying to solve the crime and the FS is trying to help them, the murderer is trying to mislead the investigators. The person playing the FS is known to everyone, but the identity of the other players is secret.

The game starts with each non-FS player being dealt 4 clue cards and 4 murder weapon cards, these are placed face up in front of each player. All players close their eyes and then the murderer wakes up and points at one of their clue cards and one of their murder weapon cards, the FS is also awake and makes note of those cards. The job of the FS is to lead the investigators to these cards by choosing words from predefined lists. There is a stack of tiles with titles like "cause of death", "location", and "time of death" (see the photo below). The FS gets to choose one word from each list in an attempt to point the investigators towards the two cards chosen by the murderer. 

[center][ImageID=1955701 medium][/center]

It can be frustrating to try to single out a specific card in front of someone. The words the FS has access to are very limiting and if a few of the weapon or clue cards are related in some way it can become nearly impossible to differentiate between them. In one of our games the murderer's clue cards were book, fiber optic cable, and computer mouse. The correct clue was fiber optic cable. Have a look at the word options in the above photo and try to imagine pointing out a fiber optic cable, let alone trying to narrow in on that when computer mouse is also an option. So a lot of the game comes down to luck, which words show up and how similar are the murderer's chosen cards to other cards that are also available.

I also find it extremely odd that the FS has to invent all of these facts about the crime yet it's the murderer that chooses the cards. Some combinations really make no sense at all or need such contrived explanations as to be useless. It was an interesting exercise in word association, but I don't think it's much of a game.

Have played this game twice, and on both occasions people have just guessed the correct combination on the first guess. People are saying that this is a rare occurrence, but it doesn't seem so. 
This is not so much a game, more a random point to two cards puzzle. 
Any game that has no discussion and just ends when someone guesses can not get higher than a 4. Like Cluedo.

A nice relative of Mysterium which is a little simpler to play and teach, and the addition of a traitor is a great idea.

The theme is somewhat grisly since you're discussion murder weapons and crime scenes. I have found it to be nearly impossible to win even if you don't take into account the traitor. This has detracted from the fun somewhat since it only took us a few plays before we gave up hope on ever figuring it out.

RATING: 6.5
When I’ve played this game I’ve had the feeling that the groups enjoyed it a bit more than I did. 

Each time a new group has played it, the hesitancy and distance of the early minutes has quite quickly been overcome by quite enthusiastic engagement. The group makes its own atmosphere as the players realise how frustratingly inadequate the clues are - and yet at the same time, how frequently they guide them to identify the murderer.

In my experience the one player who has the least agency in the game is the murderer. As the discussion narrows down the possible suspects, it’s usually pretty difficult for the murderer to deflect attention from their own cards to those of other players. And the murderer is the only player with the incentive to do so - an innocent accused stands to lose nothing, and in fact only gains in that they know they’re innocent and can focus on winning the game while the others are misled.

This game is sometimes compared to The Resistance, but the only common feature is the objective of uncovering hidden knowledge. The Resistance is a game of some logic and a great deal of direct social interaction between the players. Deception is a game of some logic and a great deal of elimination of false leads in cards. Social interaction is limited to “how can you say that a hammer is something you’d find in the kitchen?”

Where The Resistance is a rowdy, open, game full of wild banter - a game to bring out the teenager in you - Deception is a light, mild, fun game that is more likely to appeal to the disciplined, sensible, introverted side of the players. 

In sum, the perfect setting for Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is an after-workshop meeting of researchers who are, by and large, not gamers.

The Game Boy Geek Dan King pointed me to this game at BGG Con 2015 and we played it for 6 1/2 consecutive hours, :p.  This game makes me worry that I won't get Mysterium to the table anymore.  It's sort of a cross between Mysterum and The Resistance, 2 of my favorite games ever.  It works in a way that is quick and clean and tense, can't say enough good things about it, possibly my game of the year for 2015.


Update: Now that I own it, I think this game works best with 6+, so my fears that it may replace Mysterium are probably unfounded, my collection easily has a place for both of these games.

Very simple, fast and fun deduction game. This game is like Dixit meets Mysterium. Forensic Scientist is trying to explain the murder to the investigators using the tiles that give the location of the murder or how the murder occurred etc. The twist is the murderer is also sitting with those players trying to make people not understand the clues or make them think of another thing that the clue doesn't apply. This twist is so clever and creates so tense moments I love it. 
We just play it so everyone gets to be forensic scientist once and it is so much fun playing both sides. I recommend this game to everyone.

This one has potential of getting a higher rating, but I haven't played it enough times just yet to know where it places.  It may just move up to match Resistance, though. (I gave Resistance a perfect 10.) This game is very accessible and is a bit like a mix of Mysterium, Resistance/Avalon, and One Night Ultimate Werewolf... all games I adore.  Killer game that I am very happy to have Kickstarted.  :-)

I'm not a big fan of social deduction games. I just don't do deceit well apparently. This is probably the best one I've played so far though. There's more going here then just trying to figure out who is lying and who is telling the truth. Fun for me as the forensic scientist or an investigator, less so when I'm the murderer. This is the game I drag out when I have a lot of people that would rather talk than play a complicated boardgame. It always seems to go over well and I'm often surprised how capable of deception some folks are.

We just got this game and have already played it 5 times in two days. As a party game it is great. All you need is room to see everyone's card hand, which you lay on the table face up. With that, the accusations and denials begin.

Lot's of fun.

RATING: 4
Not my type of game.  Has mechanisms that remind me of Werewolf, Insider, and other party-type discuss and debate games.  Large player counts will have the problem of trying to see each others cards laid out on the table without having to stand up and walk around the table.  I'd play again if others wanted to but based on my experience, I hope that doesn't happen.

Really captures the mood of a gradual-reveal detective series, as a narrative clicks into place over several small revelations, often building to a sudden twist or moment of realisation. The limits on when to speak do a good job of preventing the chattiest player from controlling the game, and it lifts some of the pressure from the murderer, who can't be cross-examined in real time.

RATING: 6
2 partidas.

Un party tipo Cluedo, de descubir el asesino, el arma y la evidencia; que, además, tiene una pincelada del Hombres Lobo, por lo de dormir todos al principio (menos el forense) y hacer despertar al asesino.

El forense te va dando pistas, sin hablar, marcando palabras que puedan ayudarnos. Tienes que ver qué combinación de arma y evidencia, concuerda con las pistas y se da en el mismo jugador (porque todos tienen delante 4 armas y 4 evidencias), el cual sería el asesino.

Está bien pensado el juego, lo que no me gusta es que puede llegar a ser muy complicado acertar, si el asesino elige armas y evidencias raras (por ejemplo, cuando me tocó ser el asesino, elegí como arma una muleta y como evidencia unos pendientes... y no había forma de dar buenas pistas para eso).

Really great game for larger groups. Quick paced and fun. 
The quality of each game varies, though. 
You need talkative players who like to argue and accuse each other (which is just the description of our group). 
Sometimes the murderer chooses bad means and clue cards so that it is obvious in the first round it is him/her, and people are just guessing the right combination of means and clues. 
Sometimes the Forensic scientist gets really "bad" tiles and is not able to lead investigators to the murderer. 
In spite of that we like the game a lot and play it whenever there are 5 or more of us.

== Rated for higher number of players ==

+ Easy rules
+ Fast Play
+ Inlay can hold all cards sleeved

- Sometimes a round falls flat as no good clue cards pop up.
- It is often possible to rule people out very early in the game. This makes that "bad" rounds occur more often with fewer players.

* It is possible that none of the clue cards realy relate to a murderers clue. What if the best clue that somewhat relates to "shaver" is "pieces"?

RATING: 3
This is like mysterium meets the resistance. Which sounds wonderful, but ultimately if you're the murderer the only thing you can really do to throw people off is pick two cards that don't go well together. And for the investigators, you can talk everything through but you can't really defend yourself because you have no control over what's in front of you which means that ultimately the game is very random. Would much rather play one of the aforementioned games than this again.

Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a game of deduction and deception for 4-12 players that plays in about 20 minutes.

In the game, players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case – but there's a twist. The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!

It's like werewolf but with more structure and content. Now I like it better than werewolf, but there is much less special powers. My complaints for this game is more the production issue.

First, the person giving clue is allowed to give a degree of truth to the clu it is giving. A logical way to mark this would be to be able to put for example the pawn on the side if it does not really match and straight up if it does really  match. The problems is that the pawns are bullets, so they cannot be put sideways without rolling off the board. Or be placed upside down.

Second, yes again, the box is too big, but there is a huge amount of large tiles which kept me wondering, do you really need those things as cardboard tiles? Using tarot cards could have done the same thing and save a huge amount of space and reduce the production cost.

Seriously, if you enjoy social deduction at all, you deserve to give this one a try. It is a standout in this bloated genre. Trying to get into the head of the Forensic Scientist while sifting out the murderer from the crowd is both exciting and intriguing. The abstract clues you are given can narrow items down to a certain point, but the secret murderer will always try to sow confusion into the ranks. Tons of fun!

Bei diesem Spiel geht es darum einen Mord (ein Rätzel) zu lösen, das aus 2 Karten, einem Motiv und einer Mordwaffe besteht, die man unter vielen Karten finden bzw. der Mörder verschleiern muss.
Alle Spieler erhalten jeweils vier Mordwaffen und 4 Motive (jeweils Karten) und verdeckt je eine Rollenkarte. Der Forensiker deckt sich auf und fordert alle Spieler auf ihre Augen zu schließen. Anschließend darf der Mörder seine öffnen und dem Forensiker zwei Karten (Mordwaffe, Motiv) von seiner eigenen Auslage zeigen).
Der Forensiker deckt darauf 6 Plättchen auf, auf denen jeweils 6 Begriffe stehen, z.B. der Tatort: Wald, Kirche, Wohnsiedung, Kneipe, usw. oder auch Gefundenes auf der Leiche: Körperflüssigkeiten, nichts, ...
Auf diese 6 Plättchen legt er nun jeweils 1 Marker zu je einem Begriff, die auf die beiden vom Mörder gedeuteten Karten hinweisen sollen. Reihum darf nun jeder seine Meinung äussern. In der zweiten und dritten Runde wird je ein neues Plättchen gezogen und ein anderes damit ersetzt. Nur durch diese Plättchen darf der Forensiker mit den anderen Kommunizieren. Alle anderen Spieler, auch der Mörder hat im gesammten Spiel jeweils einen Tip. wenn dieser stimmt gewinnen die Ermittler, falls nicht geht es weiter. Wenn am Ende von Runde drei die Karten nicht idetifiziert sind, gewinnt der Mörder.
Das Spiel hat starke Ähnlichkeit zu "Mysterium" und zu "The Resistance" was mir echt gut gefällt.
Mir haben alle Rollen gefallen. Als Forensiker freut man sich innerlich (oder heult), darf das aber nicht sagen. Als Mörder musst du alle von dir überzeugen, was, wie ich finde sehr schwer ist, da die Tips des Forensikers sehr viele Karten ausschließen kann und als Ermittler musst du miträtzeln und dich fragen: "Was möchte der Forensiker mir mit dieser Auslage sagen???" :) -> Ausserdem spielt man nur knappe 20 Minuten daran.

The best social deduction game, 'nuff said. While the high points of Deception may not be as high as those in Secret Hitler or Werewolf, Deception is just a more consistent game. The roles are fun, the design allows for shy players like myself to be more easily involved, the game plays with 5-6 better than most party games, and solving the crime, giving the perfect clue or even getting away with murder feels so so good.

Deception is a lowkey social deduction game for up to 12 players. As detectives in the Hong Kong police department, it's your jobs to solve the homicides of the city's murderers, but little do you know that the latest murder was committed by one of your own. As the murderer mislead your fellow detectives with the clues that are shared with the table. A great social deduction game for those adverse to conflict or find difficulty in telling blatant lies.

Played this a few times in a row, and it the best version of this kind of game I have played. Hidden roles, deduction and player interaction.

Only played with 4 & 5 and it looks as if it gets more interesting with more players. 

My only thought is that it 'may' get a little stagnant after multiple plays, even though it is a ton of fun to play, there isn't really much 'game' here.

RATING: 5
I really like that unlike some other social deduction games you actually have something to go off of fairly early rather than things initially people just randomly accusing each other. The options for each clue set also feel a good balance of giving you enough varied options while being vague enough that the murderer can make wayward interpretations without being obvious about it. However at the end of the day I don't like social deduction, so appreciate this game more than i enjoy playing it.

Mysterium meets Resistance, Deception is another deduction game that is really great in all roles. It's fun to piece together the clues left behind to identify the murder. It's really great to be the one nudging the investigators in the right direction. But it's best when you're evil and trying to skew the clues that are given in a way that prevents everyone from guessing correctly.

They definitely made some improvements over the original version (CS Files), and I'm really glad that I blind backed this project ages ago.

Resistance meets Mysterium. 

First play was with a large group (9+).  It worked well but it was a bit hard to see everyone's cards around a long table.  It also seemed to drag with the large number of players.  I think this may be best with like 6-8 players.

I need to play this some more to finalize my opinion of it.

Of all of the Mafia/Werewolf style games, this seems the most constricted and abstracted.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, since the game performs pretty admirably.  This is a game of restricted information that is often bad information, but that's the information you have to work with.  Not every game seems solvable at first, but that's where the fun is.

I really enjoyed this game.  I like social deduction games and this one is very creative. What I like best about it is that unlike other deduction games (like Resistance or Werewolf) you actually have something real and tangible to talk about right out of the gate.  First couple rounds of these games are usually boring, trying to force conversation "I think I heard him moving" or other nonsense.  This game has actual, important gameplay to discuss right out of the gate.  I also like the limited, uninterrupted explanations.  First, it keeps one person from dominating the table (guilty) and second, it forces quieter people who are often very perceptive to share what they're thinking.

I think this is my favorite game it this class of games.

Good mix of subjectivity and logic. There is always a debate after each game which I love (for good guys or bad guys). You don't have to lie to people's face which makes the game more adaptable to a wider audience. 

I just always want to play this game when there are around 7-9 people. Can't wait for the expansion.

This rating went down from the initial. Most of the time the game is okay, but due to the sheer number of random draws, it can go downhill if there isn't some continuity in the way the cards fit together. Good party game possibilities here though. Still better than Werewolf and Resistance by a mile. Played with four; really want to try a game with the Witness character -- I think it would be much more suspenseful.

Very similar style play to Mysterium.  2 plays.  I was the Forensic Scientist in the first and no one even looked at the murderer's cards!  She picked some kind of Tube and a Cassette Tape which no one keyed on and I couldn't get them to even look at.  The 2nd game I was an investigator and correctly guessed Potted Plant/Apple.  The FS gave a clue of poisoned as the cause of death even though I had poisonous cloud and poison needle in my weapon cards and I wasn't the murderer. LOL

Very good semi-cooperative game which plays better with higher numbers due to the collaborative, discussion-based play style.

Always followed by a request to play at least once more.

UPDATE 9/4/2017: Down to a 6, chopping block.  While I think the game is well-designed, the issue is the inconsistent experience.  Like Mysterium, you could be completely screwed by the tile draw.  I would prefer games with a tighter design like Resistance or One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

-----
Easy for non-gamers to get into and there is actual deductive reasoning involved instead of random guessing.

I've enjoyed this far more than Mysterium and it does work well with 5 or 6 players.  I would say 7 or 8 players with the Witness and Accomplice is where Deception hits the peak.  I would not go beyond 8 as the game can be very confusing at that point.

For me, it's a great alternative to Mysterium and something that is more consistently fun (success/fun in Mysterium is largely predicated on having a good ghost). I can play Deception with family or friends and it's great with both. Really, really like it!

RATING: 9
Wow does this game fire the Resistance for me. The problem with resistance is there's a lot of social pressure on the traitors, and a lot of people find that uncomfortable. In Deception, that pressure from being the secret murderer is much relieved. Looking at each person's evidence in front of them, The group collectively tries to piece together the Forensic Analyst's clues by talking together out-loud. If you're the murderer, all you have to do is try and find an alternate interpretation of the clues that would lead people to believe and accuse someone else. The deduction element to this game is great, and since it's a cooperative thinking game, the murderer can just pretend he's a good guy, and cleverly sidestep suspicion. This game marries the hidden traitor element, and deduction, into an excellent game.

Very different game as the clue giver vs investigator (and expect the murderer as well). Fun game, has the hidden team elements from the Resistance, but with a guessing arrangement, and with more information on which to start making deductions.

RATING: 7
Good: 
A pretty fast paced hidden role game where you actually get some clues to help deduce who the murder is. 

The game encourages a lot of cross-table talk to interpret the clues given by the CSI. This makes it a good filler and/or party game.

Bad: 
Too easy for the good guys so far. For some reason, anyone playing the CSI is able to lay out enough information to point to the murder weapons by round 2. We haven't played with the accomplice/witness yet, so I am hoping those roles will increases the challenge and enjoyment of the game.

[b]2016-03-28 7.60[/b] After 32 Plays:
Comparing to other popular social deduction games, Deception gives players more information to actually deduct from. The Murderer's selection of murder weapon and evidence is important from the start as it sets the difficulty for the round. It still forces players to lie though. But the murderer can more readily distract them by pointing out how other players' cards also match with the clue. Much prefer this over One Night Werewolf, both gamers and non-gamers in my groups have enjoyed this one.

An immediate hit. Played 9 times in a row with a small group of 4 people. Can see this being one of my all time favorite party games for a long time. Had an evening with friends playing at full 12 players which was one of my favorite gaming experiences. The atmosphere this game creates with the right group is just incredible. Social gaming at its best.

Edit: The game can be a little fragile, and is sometimes just okay. I think the players need to really buy into the theme to make it fun. It’s not as fun if it’s played too clinically.

This game killed The Resistance for me. Excellent deduction game from social and logical standpoints.

RATING: 10
If you're looking for a large party game with a different game mechanism rather than "pleasing the judge" - then this is a game for you. There's traitors and murders in our midst! As a group we try to unravel the mystery as our forensic scientist tries to give clues to help reveal the identity of the murder and their accomplice. The murder and accomplice clearly want to avoid detection and win the game ... which makes every discussion round interesting - because they want to throw everyone off their scent -- and believe someone else did the grisly murder! 

We had a group of 8 ... and played this 6-straight times with each match more fun than the previous one. A great time - challenging, and taxes your power of perception AND deception ... A great game!

Excellent game!
Not played enough to know if it is a Resistance/Werewolf/Mysterium-killer, but certainly has the potential for it. Great fun gameplay, maybe a bit simplistic.

An excellent addition would be if questions could be asked to the moderator as a part of the gameplay.

The rules of the CS-Files version are quite poorly written, and to be honest, parts of it are poorly designed. Some house rules makes this a much more enjoyable game for me.

Great, great social hidden role party game. It's like a cross between Avalon and Mysterium, where one player takes the role of the forensic expert, one is the murderer, and the rest are investigators trying to catch the murderer. Each player has a bunch of cards that can be clues or murder weapons, and the killer chooses one of each to kill the victim. The forensic expert is sort of like Merlin and the Ghost combined, and knows who the killer is, but can't speak and can only give clues based on the cards the killer chose and what profiles randomly show up. The investigators then need to decide each round who the killer is.

When you're one of the investigators it's really fun fighting over who you think the murderer is. Although I don't really enjoy being the Forensic Investigator as much, in a big group (6 or more) the game really shines. I wouldn't play it with less than 6. One of the great things about Deception is that the bigger the group, the more fun it is! If you have 12 players, it still plays fast and fluid and is better than playing with less. It's great to bring out for those big parties.

Deception seems to want to cross The Resistance with Codenames, and I don't think it works very well. All the words are supplied for you, so the creativitiy Codenames demands of you is lacking. In addition, the words are intentionally only vaguely related to each other, lest the game becomes too easily solved. The best you can do is make extremely tenuous associations, so the game feel like it's mostly just a guessing game, with about the same level of deductive skill as, say, 20 Questions. That's not a knock on 20 Questions; I just wonder why I'd play this over that, The Resistance, and/or Codenames. I can see how other people might enjoy this game (the group I just played with seemed to), but I was not a huge fan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This one is a Resistance/Werewolf/ all other deduction type games Killer!!

It's just great because there's all the talk, double talk, accusations, lying to the face, etc... like in those games but in this one there's actual reasoning and thought process involved!

The Forensic Scientist knows who the killer is and how the murder was committed and has to try to give clues to the investigators to allow them to deduce who is the killer and who the murder was perpetrated!

Depending on the number of players there can be some extra roles, like the Accomplice that tries to shift suspicion away from the Murderer, the witness that knows who the Murderer and the Accomplice are (he doesn't know which is which) so he can try to steer the investigators in the right direction... but he has to be careful because if he's to obvious and the Investigators are able to get the Murderer and the clues, they Murderer and the Accomplice will have a chance of unmasking the Witness and if they do it's like they caught it and killed him and so there's no one to testify and they go free!

Very very cool excellent game!!! LOVED IT!

Very original idea, but I wonder how it will fare with a larger group (played with 4).

Update: It fares well, indeed, but much rides on the clue giving skill of the Forensics player. Also, do not allow the investigators to dawdle just because no one wants to spend their badge on an accusation to get a new clue. The game can grow tiresome quick if it deadlocks like that.

RATING: 9
I'd been wanting to try this for ages and finally got a couple of game in of another persons copy. I didn't enjoy being a Witness, but loved being an investigator (and was guessed as being the Witness in that game as I deduced so quickly).

I still want to own it and will when a reasonably price or trade appears, but I hope I have other players who are more interested in being the Forensic scientist as that role appeals to me less.

Edit: Now own it and it's even more awesome! I played Forensic Scientist the first game in order to teach it and I found I actually enjoyed that as well. I was also the murderer for the first time and liked how tactical you could be with choosing your murder weapon and evidence based on what other cards were out there. I still don't want to be the Witness, but love this game. After teaching it we played it 4 more times and only stopped for something a little more strategic!

Short and sweet, but packs a really good punch. It gives me a similar vibe to Codenames, but I think I like this one more. The clue-giving is neat, and the fact that the number of weapons and pieces of evidence scales with the number of players is very cool. I only wish I could get it to the table more, and that there was just a little more to it. It almost feels like the game is over just as it begins, and I wish that there was more to Deception than just guessing two cards. The hidden roles help, but I don't think that they add enough to allow the game to leave a lasting impression. Still, this game plays a large group very quickly, and the puzzle-y nature of the game works really well for me.

I like the concept of giving and interpreting clues to identify the secret culprit. However, I'm worried that Deception falls between two chairs in my gaming groups.

Still, I'd like to give it a try in the right group.

This is a fantastic party deduction game, love the social interaction, love the mechanics, only thing that keeps it from being perfect is that the more players there are, the easier it gets for the investigators to find the murder tools, so I would think more roles that add twists in favor of the murderer somehow would be cool. But even as it is, amazing party game.

(After 16 Plays) 10/21/16: This is another hidden role/bluffing/deduction game that my friends seem to really enjoy. The theme of this one seems to work pretty well (better than Resistance Avalon) and it is often easier understood than other games of the genre. I have had an issue where the murderer does a poor job of selecting their cards and is accused correctly very early on. This is not the games fault but it caused this to really fall flat on an occasion.

This one was pretty fun at first and then INCREDIBLY fun later. One con is despite the cool bullets and pretty nice badges, the game doesn't have a lot of fancy chrome or components. It's nice that they're cardboard tiles for what the forensic scientist uses and not just regular cards but all the art and other cards are pretty basic and there's no "wow" factor when looking at this game. However, it does what it needs to well and this game isn't about components. This game is a surprise hit for me in so many way. Plays well with many numbers of players and is easy to learn, simple to play, engaging fun and near perfect for what it's trying to achieve. One "con" is that the game needs to be "physical" meaning during the night phase with larger players, it can be necessary for everyone to stand for several reasons and later people will want to get up and move around to look at cards but I actually like this.

How can a game seem to blend or at least remind you of:
-Resistance Avalon
-Clue
-Concept
-Mysterium

And yet be simpler, more accessible, and arguably just as fun or more fun than any of these? This game is an all around winner. I can't recommend this game enough. It goes into one of my rare "10s" for what it is, what it's trying to achieve, it is near perfect.

Rather group dependent for how long it runs and how enjoyable it is, as are most social deductions.

Great party game, good timeframe and avoid many of the issues associated with Werewolf-type games. However, the game tends to be too easy for the Investigators (even on hard mode) and the event tiles make it even easier.

Tremendamente uguale a Avalon: The Resistance. Gioco che andrebbe accusato per plagio. Rispetto ad Avalon, questo gioco ha gli indizi da scoprire un po' in stile Cluedo. Personalmente ho trovato questa 'imitazione' meno bella di Avalon. Nessuna voglia di riprovarla.

Enjoyable blend of Werewolf and Mysterium. Needs some good storyelling and/or RPing to really get into the feel of things. Not sure about the Hong Kong setting, but otherwise this is a blast: one of those games that you can't play 'just once'.

RATING: N/A
In this game, one player is the Forensic Scientist and all other players are investigators. But the killer is one of the investigators (a.k.a. traitor). Each investigator and killer are each dealt weapon cards and key piece of evidence cards face up to the table.

All players close their eyes. The Forensic Scientist will ask the killer to open their eyes and show the weapon and the key evidence that was used in his crime.

The FS will now give clues to the investigators in such a way that reminds me greatly of Mysterium. The clues are vague, yet helpful in some way. The investigators will talk about what they think could have been the weapon or key evidence in the crime. Meanwhile the killer is secretly misleading the investigators into choosing the wrong evidence.

An investigator can accuse the murderer at any time, but must pick the correct piece of evidence and weapon.

The best thing about this game is the tremendous amount of weapon and evidence cards. The cards look great and really get you thinking about how it could have been used in a crime.
At any given time in the game there could be something like 15 weapons showing on the table and 15 key pieces of evidence. That's a lot of evidence to sift through.

I'm kicking myself for not backing this on Kickstarter! But this is a fantastic party game that combines elements of my favorite social deduction games: the bluffing of Werewolf, the deduction of words and images from Mysterium and Codenames, and the thrill of all three! No matter the time frame of the game, which can range from ten minutes to a full hour, Deception gets everyone engaged into the conversation and never lets one player take all the glory. Great game for beginners and veterans; haven't heard one negative comment from anyone's who played this game!

These quick party games are popping up a lot. You have a forensic investigator that is dropping clues to the investigators by indicating the best way to describe the crime. The investigators must then try to determine the two main aspects of the crime by accusing one of the other players. Although a little bit odd due to the strange categories that are difficult to chose from and many make no sense when related to the cards you are trying to lead people to, this game is still quite fun. You can also add an accomplice and a witness to really shake things up. Seeing how people interpret your often strange clues is fun and we found ourselves playing several games in a row.

RATING: 7
If this game has one weakness in design, it is that everyone has to study the cards good beforehand in case they are the murderer so they know what they will choose. If they don't, they will make a terrible choice, and anyone that studies the board too closely after the role reveal will give themselves away. Of course, if you aren't the murderer, all that effort was wasted.

Best with 6+ players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love, love, love the hidden-role implementation of this game, in that it's more a logic puzzle and less a series of arguments about minimal knowledge.  The only reason it's not a 9 or a 10 is that some card combinations are brutal.  If one person has three different cutting implements and ends up as the murderer, good luck to the Forensic Scientist.  Fortunately the games are never so long that you can't just dish out another one.

Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a social deduction game based around solving a murder.  One player is the "forensic scientist" (very similar to the ghost in Mysterium), one player is secretly the murderer, and everyone else is investigators.  Each investigator and the murderer has a number of cards representing objects in front of them.  The forensic scientist, who knows who the murderer is but can't speak, plays a series of clue cards that are supposed to give hints that relate to the murderer's cards.  Each investigator has one accusation, and must guess the exact two-card combination that represents the circumstances of the murder.  If no one guesses correctly, the murderer gets away.  While there was thankfully less arguing in this game than other social deduction games, I didn't really find it to be particularly interesting.  The murderer player doesn't really have an opportunity to do anything besides act like a normal investigator, all of whom are trying to clear themselves.  The cards and clues didn't provoke thought like Mysterium dream cards do.  I found it difficult to become at all invested in the game.

RATING: 8
Great party game. Easy to teach and plays quickly (about 15min). Best to not let discussions go on to long. A timer helps. A fast playing deduction game with traitor(s) and no player elimination that can play up to 14 people? Yes please!

A lot of fun working with the group to deduce the murderer and the murderer trying their best to throw suspicion on someone else. The "traitor" element doesn't seem as harsh as other games. So people who normally hate being the bad guy might do better with this one.

The game isn't a replacement for Mysterium as some have said. Mysterium is good game in it's own right and serves a smaller group of people. Deception isn't a replacement for games like Battlestar Galatica or Shadows over Camelot. This game is more of a replacement for Clue.

Being the murderer can be a difficult win with 5 players. Sometimes the cards just incriminate you early on and there really isn't much you can do about it. 

However things get more difficult for the investigators when there are more players. Sweet spot is probably 6-8 players.

With 5 players you can increase difficulty for investigators by giving out extra means and clue cards.

There is some imagery that may not be appropriate for younger kids but those cards can be removed. 

Also we found that 12 and under tended to struggle with the deduction aspect of the game at times due to life inexperience. Not understanding what some items are and/or the correlation of the clues given by the Forensic Scientist. For the most part they did fine though. 14 and up had no problems and played the game quite well.

(01/18) I love this game but haven't played it so much because it relays a lot in language and I don't live in an english speakin g country, but somehow when I am with people that know english, we tend to play other games, this being more of a "deduction party game", usually when we're in the mood for party games not everyone is fluent in english.

Haven't played it yet, but it's on the way to my house.  Based off of the mechanics alone this is an automatic 8 in my book, the question is whether or not this will jump to a 8+ after a few playthroughs

Finally got a chance to play it and this is an awesome game at all player counts and is becoming my goto game for large group social deduction games.  Played this at 4 players and it was solid, played it at 6 players and this is when it starts to get good with the added roles.  Then 12 players is a monster on it's own the game is a ton of fun, but seems to be in favor of the murderer unless if he picks an obvious weapon and evidence.  To fix this I'm definitely going to increase the chances of the Scientist to pull an event card.

Mysterium without the art seems like a tough sell. What makes the game for me is the ability for dark humor in the narrative, being able to accuse your friend of murdering a man with a blender, but forgetting his flip flops behind when hiding the body in a slushie machine. Definitely needs a group willing to act, I could see this fall flat among serious gamers trying to maximise the chances of getting to the right solution.

Mysterium-style variant (one silent clue giver/GM) for a larger group setting (ideally 6-7) with one or more chameleons convincingly misdirecting the other investigators in order to win. Might be a good springboard into the dynamics of different roles and associated motivations with dramatic twists.

RATING: 10
Probably the best new game I've played this year (2016).  It's like playing werewolf where the moderator is GMing the game in a way that's interactive instead of just rules moderating.  I think the sweet spot for this game is maybe 8 or so.  That way you can get the special roles and have some decent card combos out to confuse things.  Definitely turn your cards upside down so people can read them.

RATING: 7
An interesting social deduction game, with more emphasis on deduction than most. I like the back and forth of the clues, and how the killer must rely on misdirection to win rather than straight-up lying. I also like that the killer gets a meaningful choice to start the game, of which two cards represent the murder. It's a bit easier to grasp all the possibilities in this than in a more chaotic game like One Night Ultimate Werewolf, which kind of evens out the experience. The exciting moments aren't as exciting, but it's much less likely to hit a dud round too. Overall, I like it, but not enough to really want to play it over other similar games.

Downgrading the rating from a 7 to a 5. I just don't get this game. I've played it many times now, and it always seems like its really hard to figure out who the murderer is. Maybe I'm playing it wrong, but I've read and reread the rules so many times and I just can't get it. When the investigators win, its rare (only twice out of 6 plays) and it seems like its just by a lucky guess. I like Secret Hitler at lot better. (10/23/17)

This is a fun game that takes some of the ideas of Mysterium and some of the ideas of social deduction games and mixes them together to create a fun one vs many experience. Rounds play relatively quickly. Set up is a bit of a chore and sometimes the killer can be somewhat disadvantaged by bad luck, but overall it feels fairly balanced and is a good time. Generally willing to play, although often would rather play Mysterium or the Resistance depending on my mood.

So deliciously devious. All of the roles are a joy to play, and you can see how well you really know your friends and family. We've often begun laughing before we've even started, at the murder weapons that include favorites like "dirty water" and "the machine," or the evidence left behind, like the puppet who happens to be decapitated. It's so fun to be the murderer, and just sit quietly as the investigators grow more and more convinced that the other is the bad guy, or to narrow down the suspects and finally catch the culprit. My only quibble is that some of the cards the forensic scientist has at their disposal can be entirely unhelpful, but that may be intentional. We played with parents who don't game much, and they were still talking about it the next day. I feel like this would be a hit across a wide range of groups. Deception has settled into my Top 5, and I can see it being a favorite for a long time.

This is my favorite deduction and social deduction game. From the first clue that the forensic scientist gives, you can start making guesses and pointing fingers. It's a lot of fun playing any of the roles, but giving the clues can be an excercise in frustration, but the source of the most satisfaction when players catch your hints correctly. I will play this game at any player count from 4 to 12, but i think the sweet spot is from 6 to 8, playing with all the roles.

RATING: 8
A quicker, less abstract alternative to Mysterium. Since this is more of a word-association game, how helpful the clues are depends strongly on the random boards that get laid out. Sometimes it can be very easy narrowing down the murderer, and sometimes it feels dwonright impossible. Part of this also depends on how social of a group you are playing with. Overall, I really enjoy owning both Deception and Mysterium since they both have very different strengths. Deception does a great job of supporting its larger player count.

An expansion could really kick this up a notch. Something creative like specialty roles similar to Avalon/Resistance. The promo role included with the kickstarter copy is kind of a dud.

A party game with some social deduction, some old fashioned deduction, intuition.  One player gives clues, one player is secretly the murderer and everyone else is trying to figure out the pattern from the clues.  Much more intuitive play style than Codenames. I love a game that leaves people talking long after it is over.

Bumped to a 9:  Fourth play, we were yelling at each other after the game ended.  Awesome!

RATING: 8
Clue for gamers is an apt description. The game really shines because it provides a structure that allows the clue-giver [forensic scientist] and other players to create a space that allows a narrative to be formed.

The engagement develops from how the clue-giver's narrative overlaps with the narrative developed by the other players, and the cat and mouse mind-games played between the murderer and witness.

Half a point deducted due to component quality. Cards should be much bigger, and of better quality considering price to component ratio.

April 2017: This one was a hit for me at Gen Con 2016  (best/funniest moments).  My high school club likes it a lot.  Keys to a good session:
1) Bump up the # of cards per player, if you think it plays too easy.
2) Emphasize that everyone take some time to look around the table at everyone's cards so that the murderer can have a chance to pick cards that aren't *too* different from some other cards.  Otherwise, it's too easy a game.

RATING: 6
This game (the copy I have played is called "the CS Files", according to BGG it is the same game though) - whose main premise is a group of people discussing things amongst themselves, with at least one of the players secretly trying to steer them away from the correct answer, and another player who gives certain limited clues but who can't say anything - is actually quite entertaining, much more so than you might think from reading the above description. It's essentially a pure social game, and not the kind of thing I usually like. It's still not a game I'd often choose to play - but it works well and certainly isn't bad.

Such a great social deduction game. It diffuses the tension around the table like many hidden traitor games have, and replaces it with a great conversation. The base game feels like it should have a bit more in it, a few more "murder method" tiles, as well as a few more description tiles would go a long way.

Played for the first time a few weeks back. This is a great party game. The killer pick 2 pictures to represent a clue left behind and the murder weapon. And everone else is trying to guess who it was, what clue they used, and what the weapon was. There is a know all character that gives clues on the tiles, but cannot say anything. This is a lot of fun with a lot of people.

RATING: 8
A superb cross between The Resistance and Mysterium.  Imperfect information being passed via pictures and categories mixes well with social deduction and hidden traitors.

The event cards in the Forensic Scientist deck should all be removed, and instead let them draw-2-pick-1 whenever they draw -- that gives them a little more agency and removes dud draws and overpowered draws.

as is: 7/10
with events removed: 8/10

if you have the group and table space for Codenames, play this instead. the first thing you should know is that you don't have to be a big fan of the traitor mechanic to appreciate this game! it was quite unexpected that i would fall in love with this game. the second thing you need to know is that you should all get straight to the 30-second presentations and the second round clue PRONTO. this game doesn't have to drag on like an un-timed round of One Night Ultimate Werewolf. there's plenty of fun arguing what means lead to "blood loss," whether "starvation" is an accident or a disease, whether "living room" rules out video camera, etc. including the Witness and Accomplice cards in a bigger group works great as well. highly recommended game. easily replayable multiple times in a night. easily! having said that, i'm a little burnt out after 20 rapid-fire plays.

RATING: 9
For as simple as this game is, it really is fantastic.  Every single time I play as the Forensic Scientist, looking at the cards/clues I have available I think to myself, "No WAY are they ever going to be able to get this..." and yet, somehow, almost as if there's a mysterious connection, they drift into the right direction.  So many times I've seen a few "bad" clues wind up guiding them to the correct solution!  Very unique gameplay and always a great time.

RATING: 6.5
Rating after one play only. This is approachable, positive fun (and very attractively produced). My first impression was about a 7, but I have docked it a bit for one reason only: I feel its strength lies in a large-group-friendly aspect, but that's diminished by the unfortunate fact that each player needs to be able to see all of the other players' 8 smallish cards during the whole session, and that's difficult. Still, this is a nice game and I definitely will play it anytime in the future.

RATING: 8
Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is probably my favorite large group game. In this game Players take on roles of investigators with one secret murder. None of the players know each other's roles. One player is the Forensic scientist who describes the murder scene without talking and only placing clues on different card that describe the scene. It isn't much of a game but whatever it is it is fun as players argue with each other to convince others that they are not the murderer

Pros: fast gameplay.  Really interactive for all players. Game plays up to 12 players. Easy to teach rules.

Cons: oversized box.

RATING: 8.25
This game has been a real hit with my group.  We played it many times back-to-back upon introducing it, something I don't do often with my group.  The success of this game arises from how easily playable it is, while delivering a very "complete" experience in a duration typical of a filler game.

While being a hidden role game, this also has the advantage of being very approachable for players who avoid hidden role games due to the feeling of being under pressure and needing to bluff/lie to do well and preserve the experience.  When you are the Murderer in this game, your only requirement is that you not blurt that you are guilty.  You are not placed on the spot to defend your actions as in other such games, because everyone at the table has the same mindset and understanding: you look at all of the other cards and try to reason which ones might be the solution to the crime, and do not consider your own cards.  This is true regardless of role, and so this game avoids the issue of somewhat requiring good liars/social engineers to make it interesting.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is like a cross between The Resistance, Clue, and Mysterium. I like most everything about it other than the 'everybody gets 30 seconds to talk' part. It's a bit clunky. However, everyone talking and hanging on the forensic scientist, waiting for the next clue, is delicious. I really like this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Everyone who knows me knows that I don't like social deduction games, so this isn't necessarily a bad rating. I liked that this game didn't have misdirection requiring knowledge of the other roles/abilities which is a huge failing of most games of this type. I wasn't a huge fan of the pressure assigned to a randomly chosen player as the Forensic Scientist, and would rather play with someone choosing to play that role, but thankfully that wouldn't affect the game play!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The best part of this game comes after it's already over, when the forensic scientist explains the murder they invented to explain the weapon and evidence. The game itself is a little shallow for me. It gestures at social deception, storytelling, and co-op hinting, but there are so few decisions made that nothing gets explored enough to be interesting.

Played a handful of games while at Origins 2017 and I just don't get the appeal of this game. Most of the time it was kinda lack luster and the murder and their chosen cards were figured out before the end of the first round. Only one game felt tense and people were strongly divided between who the murder might be and/or what their cards were. Seems like this game is a bit too dependent on who is playing, what the spread of cards looks like, and what boards the scientist has. A single bit of good/bad luck in any of these areas can easily cause the game to swing between being a flop and being fun. I just experienced too many flops in my plays and there are other social deduction games out there that are much more consistent with how a game goes.

The best party game ever made if played thematically rather than purely mechanically.

It's not explicit in the rules but the Forensic Pathologist must come up with a good story in their head, and tell it through the cards, rather than just be reactive to the players.

The players must understand this in order to get the most fun out of the game.

Really enjoy this hidden role deduction game. Feels like a cross between Werewolf and Mysterium - one player knows the guilty party and the murder means and key evidence, but is restricted to sometimes less than helpful clue cards to try to guide the rest of the team into solving the case.

Slower paced and clearly more thinky than either of those, we still played several times back to back so each person could experience the fun and "frustration" of trying to give the clues.

This is my favorite party game. It's a blast to play in medium-large groups. However, in larger groups, the increased number of suspects makes it more difficult to find the murderer if he or she chooses their cards wisely.

Avalon Meets Clue. Great Game. Very difficult to be the murderer and get away with it.

RATING: 7.8
Really great addition to the genre, and I'd argue better than Avalon or the Resistance. In all these games, you've got a couple of teams working against each other with limited information and everyone acting like the good guys, even though one team is full of bad guys that are bluffing. The thing that makes this worthy of owning is that the Forensic Scientist controls the information flow of the game. So rather than there being abstract "missions" and who acted how and when, you collectively are trying to figure out the information from what the scientist is giving you. I think it makes for a more interesting game to be trying to figure out what the scientist is telling you rather than to try and figure out how people acted in a hidden manner.

One player communicates clues with vague word associations. The others do what they can to make the connections, similar to the way Mysterium works, but Deception is much shorter.  It's an interesting social deduction game that requires more than deducing who the murderer is; I find that part rather simple just by reading people.  Narrowing it down from there is the hard part, and that's where Deception gets interesting.

Have played this several times at a local meet-up. There's a bit of deduction - potentially but it depends largely on being able to get inside the moderator's head. The clues are quite random and often it's hard to see how such things could be even remotely construed to relate to any of the cards on the table. It mostly just boils down to a guessing game with very little actual deduction. My interest is about gone for this one. Very frustrating when, after one round at the meet-up, folks want to go again rather than changing things up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a light, very fast-playing game of deduction and hidden roles.  In the basic game players are each dealt a means of murder card, evidence card, and role, either a vanilla investigator, the murderer, or the forensic scientist.  Much like the sheriff in Bang! the forensic scientist is revealed at the start and runs the game.  He has everyone close their eyes and the murderer open them, Werewolf style, and identify a means of murder and evidence card in front of himself.  The goal is for the investigators to figure out the murderer and exact cards in the solution.  However, the murderer is among them and trying to steer them away from the solution.  The means for discovering the solution are through clues given by the forensic scientist.  The forensic scientist knows the solution but cannot speak, instead he has tiles with small word banks related to a certain category such as "location of the crime".  He gives clues to the solution by selecting a word on these tiles until either the murderer is caught or gets away.

I'm not the biggest fan of hidden role games because typically there is very little actual gameplay associated with them and it just boils down to blind accusation and guessing.  That is definitely not the case here.  This game blends actual deductive gameplay with social elements very well to make a hidden role game that is actually a game.

I will say that the actual game experience can be very sporadic.  Sometimes you will get such perfect clues that two of our games we were able to determine the solution after only two clues, these games lasted 30 seconds.  Other times either there were such similar cards among players or the clue tiles the forensic scientist had to work with were so vague or unhelpful that we were almost blindly guessing by the end of the three rounds.  And sometimes the murderer was just convincing enough that the social elements actually worked the way they were supposed to.

This game is super short.  Even the games that ran their course with 6 players took less than 15 minutes.  A great filler, especially for larger groups of more casual and/or social players (I believe this plays up to 12).  There are also variants in the box that mix up the gameplay a bit.  There can be an accomplice who is on the murderer's "team".  He knows the solution and acts as another player against rest of the investigators.  There can also be a witness who knows the solution but is working with the investigators, the catch is that even if the murderer is caught, if he can finger the witness he still wins.

If I had a couple negative things to say about this game it would be that the sporadic nature of the game can ruin some experiences.  Nobody likes to set up a game for it to be over in 30 seconds.  It also makes it difficult to adjust the difficulty.  You can add or subtract cards in front of each player to make it easier or harder but when you can go 3 games in a row with a loss then 2 games in a row winning in 30 seconds (which literally happened with my group) it's hard to determine where the difficulty should be.  Another small problem I have is that I kind of wish  there were some more tiles.  There are a ton of evidence and means of murder cards that you can go through probably a couple dozen games before needing to repeat a single card but only 2 or 3 games before you're reusing the clue tiles.  Mixing them up provides enough different combinations that you still get some variety though so this is a minor problem.

In the end this is both a great filler and one of my favorite casual hidden role games.

Even people who dislike social deduction will at least like it cos of how quick it is, and how interesting the designer made it to be.

Short, sweet, and to the point social deduction experience. I like it better than any other social deduction game I've played so far because it solves the number one problem of social deduction games -- baseless accusations. People don't get too butthurt over accusations because it's entirely based on the Forensic Scientist's clues and the cards in front of people. So much better than "He blinked twice! He's the mafia!"

Often gamers will denigrate hidden role games on the basis that generally it's impossible to actually deduce the identity of the bad guy conclusively based on the information available. This game seems like a response to that, giving the players more information, and incorporating more deduction. But then the discussion and the hidden role element feel like a bit of a waste of time. Giving a player more agency and control to "work it out" then end it takes away agency and involvement from the other players. This plus the fact that the murderer is completely at the mercy of what tiles come out mean a game experience at around 3.5/10. I rounded this to 4 as I would potentially try again with a higher player count to add a little more chaos and make discussion more necessary.

I've played this three times, at one session, so far. I get the feeling that this game is very dependant on the group. The first play wasn't great fun, but the last one was pretty good.

I have a vague feeling that this won't keep the same rating for me with more plays. I think either we'll learn how to play it well, and how to make it fun, and then I think it will rise a point or two. Or, it might turn out there really isn't anything interesting in there, and it'll probably drop to a four.

Okay deduction party-ish game. Feels like there is something missing and it is a bit repetitive. Can be fun if you're looking for that specific game, but I feel Mysterium has more going on and is slightly more interesting. This is still fun just feels more niche.

Different social deduction.  Very well rounded, and enough similarity between cards to make every game into an interesting one.  I think it works best with about 6, since that allows for the accomplice ti participate.  It also has enough game that it is, to me, much better than other social deduction games that seem to be more of social activities than 'games'

One of the most boring gaming experiences I've had in the last couple of years.
Maybe we're seasoned gamers. Maybe we shouldn't play this with non-gamers. Maybe I'm just too analytic.

But to guess the murder, murder weapon and item right after only two (!!) cards have been set by the foreign investigator (cause of death and location) screams of game design issues to me. 

Felt really bad spoiling the game so I've ended up running as foreign investigator after that. We also added in an Accomplice. But even then our group of 6 usually got the culprit the first round, or possibly on the second. We all agreed the game might be better if you'd add in more murder weapons and items per person, but if you already try salvaging a game after the first playthroughs that is a clear sign to me the whole design just doesn't work.

Great twist on the Hidden Role mechanic.  These genre of games were undoubtedly becoming dull for me, but being able to have tangible components to argue your innocents makes for much better game play.  Unlike other hidden role games, in Deception you can make factual arguments based on the cards on the table. In other games, like the resistance, most arguments you make are purely circumstantial and have no real weight to them.  Additionally this game is great for introduction to the genre since its not just pure lying.

I am enamored with this game. After playing Avalon and others to death, hidden role games started to lose their appeal to me. Deception takes a hidden murderer role and adds a whodunnit/Mysterium edge to it so that everyone is engaged. It can be a filler, but often folks enjoy it so much that we play it over and over again into the wee hours. We haven't tired of it yet!

Even more fun than I expected it to be, I was worried the murderer would be obvious but I have seen nearly a 50/50 win-loss-balance of the murderer to the inspectors after several plays now.

The whole idea of misleading and deduction of facts adds for more complexity than a game like Avalon, and I find the process of convincing others, while not trying too hard fascinating.  I honestly think it might even be harder to bluff in this game than Avalon, but Avalon requires you to to pay more attention to the individual decisions and have a much better memory.

I think I still prefer Avalon, particularly because of its unique mix of roles.  But overall, both games easily rank highly on my top party game list.

Interesting game that combines social deduction with a little bit of logical deduction: It's frustrating usually for the murderer because the hints just don't match to other players cards. So much easier to be investigators.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rock solid Mafia/Werwolf style game, probably my favorite in a genre that is not my favorite. The fact that no one is really out until the very end ups the fun-factor. The added element of constructing a narrative from evidence and clues pushes it over the top.

The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced this is a story-telling game in disguise. And it's really in this idea of telling a good story that the game will succeed or fail. The many cards that players lay out in front of them provide plenty of opportunity for creative thinking. How you combine the evidence with the players is like a giant game of Clue, but one where you are forced to come up with multiple versions of the same murder story (like Clue the movie!). As part of doing well in the game is about trying to convince the investigator that your story is the one that holds water, you're incentivized to make your story that much more believable.

I only wish the focus on that narrative construction to an even larger degree. Because in the end, Deception really is just a variation on an old and well-tested formula. The story-telling elements are fun, but I've seen players shy away from that, in which case the game plays out with much less pizazz. To mitigate this possibility, play with a large group for maximum impact, but make sure that everyone is on board with the premise before starting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game can be pretty accurately described as [thing=178900][/thing]/[thing=113997][/thing] meets [thing=925][/thing].  The clue giver knows who the murderer is and has limited abilities to describe who did it.  

I don't think I would quite say it's the best of both worlds, but it addresses my biggest complaints from both Mysterium and Werewolf. Mysterium's biggest problem is downtime.  The ghost often spends minutes deciding on the first clue of the round, and everyone else is left twiddling their fingers.  In Deception, the clue giver can usually give one clue right away and everyone can start discussing.  

My biggest problem with Werewolf/Resistance is the reliance of lying/bluffing.  It just doesn't appeal to me.  I greatly prefer games like [thing=9220][/thing] where you are basing your accusations on people's actions instead of just their words.  Likewise, in Deception there is no lying.  Your best defense is to make a logical case against someone else, instead of just saying "believe me instead of them."

I rarely like deduction games, but I might actually buy this one.  And it might replace [thing=113997][/thing].

My friend came to visit me over the Holidays and wanted to play board games with my gaming group.  Before playing with us she thought all board games were like Monopoly.  I used Mysterium and Deception: Murder in Hong Kong to introduce her to board gaming.  She enjoyed Mysterium but she absolutely LOVED this game.  It isn't overwhelming with complicated rules for someone who is new to gaming and it still is enjoyable for people who enjoy games with a little more meat to them.  I highly recommend it!

Nice theme and lack of real player elimination meant that CS-Files replaced Ultimate Werwolf in my collection. Game is easy to explain and play and every group I played with enjoyed it quite a bit. 

People especially appreciated that by using their badge for trying to reveal the murderer they are nto out of the game, just loose the option to accuse but they are still playing with others. It's ultimate bluffing game where the focus may turn on those who still have a badge and are thinking of how to use it. Really improved game experience from times of Werewolf.

RATING: 9
Wow, I'm really impressed with this game. 2015 was a big year for these types of social deduction games (One Night Revolution, One Night Vampire, Codenames, Spyfall, Coup G54, Mafia de Cuba, more) but this may be the best of the bunch.

It's kind of like Codenames (or Concept) combined with a hidden role game like The Resistance. One player (the Forensic Scientist) gives clues to the other players by simply placing markers onto cards that contain text. This player can't say anything or give any other kind of indirect clues. This is important because one of the other players is a murderer and the Forensic Scientist knows who it is.

There's an interesting element that even if players find out who the murderer is, they still have to correctly guess which clue and murder weapon were used. These are represented by different cards in front of each player.

So it's essentially one player (the murderer) against all of the other players. With six or more players you add in an accomplice, making it two players versus everyone else. With a larger group you can (and probably should) also mix in a witness that is similar to Merlin from Resistance Avalon. There are also some optional event tiles you can mix in and there is just tons of variety in all of the cards and the tiles.

A really neat take on the genre and I'm eager to play more.

With at least six players you use all of the roles, plus there are just more cards out so there are more accusations being thrown around.

Even with only four players, this game still manages to be an absolute blast. It's not about winning so much as realizing all the potential hilarious means of death and clue cards.

fantastic group game. This feels like the evolution of Mysterium. Players take the roles of investigators arriving to the scene of the crime. The caveat is that one of them is the killer. One other player will be the forensic scientist, and knows who the killer is. only using limited clues from the game, the forensic scientist must lead the team of investigators to the right conclusion.

Deception could be called CSI: Mysterium. The players are all part of a team of investigators who want to solve a murder. Everyone ostensibly wants to solve the case, except one of us is also the murderer. There's a forensic specialist who knows who the murderer is... but for some reason can only indirectly hint to us what he knows.

Each player, except the Forensic specialist, gets four weapon cards and four clue cards which are placed on the table in front of them for all to see. All the players close their eyes and the murderer reveals himself to the FS and points to one of his weapon cards and one of his clue cards. The rest of the game is a struggle for the FS to get the investigators to guess these two cards and the murderer to muddy the waters and prevent that from happening.

There are three rounds. In the first round the FS puts out a bunch of tiles (like 6 or 7?) which are tied to a particular aspect of the case, like location, and that have 7 or so preset answers related to that aspect of the case. He puts a marker down on the option he's choosing, which hopefully helps identify the murderer's cards. Then there's a discussion phase. In the second and third round, the FS gets to remove one tile and replace it with a new one, which is also followed by a discussion round. At any time a player can take a guess at which cards are the correct two, but if they're wrong, they've blown their only guess. They can still take part in the discussion, but that's it. If no one guesses the murderer by the end of the game he wins.

In our first play, someone made a guess immediately after the FS put out his tiles, ending the game in something like a minute and a half. We immediately played again, and that time we went the full three rounds, but it still only took about 15 minutes.

The game shares a lot of the same feel of Mysterium in a much quicker format. The game might lose a little bit in that the FS/Ghost is fairly limited in his choice of clues, but I think that the tradeoff in time is more than worth that. I also think that this is less likely to get "played out" in the way that I think Mysterium might. The limitation on clues makes it less likely for anyone to associate "this clue is always that answer" type scenarios. And the random distribution of weapon and clue cards will make change what clues make sense for the FS to give.

The game is set in Hong Kong, and all the cards are subtitled in what I think was Chinese? Other than the title and the subtitles, there was only one other thing that suggested to me that we were in an Asian country and that was that one of the "weapons" that could be a cause of death was "work". I didn't pick up on that at first, but it was a bit of cultural jolt when I realized that working oneself to death was a big enough phenomena in China to make it into the game.

RATING: 6.4
I liked the premise, but many games the murderer got caught in a situation where they couldn't plausibly implicate anyone else without looking suspiciously obtuse, so the murderer just sat silent until their exact card combo was guessed.  We all liked investigating, but hated being the murderer.  We knew to pick cards that could double with other players, but many times the hints would unluckily rule the double out quickly.  Games the murderer stayed hidden longer were great though.

Mix of Mysterium, Dixit and The Resistance: Avalon. If you like those games this is a must buy. Plays very quickly and gives people a lot to talk about.

Probably the best title I've played in the hidden-agenda genre. Having no player elimination is hugely important to me, and this game works around that so well. People are contributing the entire game, and it even allows a bluffing game that works for players who dislike bluffing. It is all about logic and story-telling instead.

With round that last max 30 minutes, this is another one of those "just one more time" games. If you can find it, I absolutely recommend it.

A fun game but I play it a little differently. I like to have the forensic investigator chosen first, then the weapon/clue cards dealt out and looked through before I deal out the murderer/investigator cards. I also only give two round table, solo discussions. After all 6 are down and a round table solo talk is made I remove two tiles at once and replace them then give people one more chance to discuss.

Best part of this game is that it plays well with 7-10 players. Few games can accommodate that many without feeling like a drag. Even social games like Coup or Resistance does not play well with 7+ players.

The game is indeed inspired by werewolf or Mafia. However, everyone participates in the discussion as they try and pinpoint the killer. I like that games are relatively short and moves along in a rapid pace, assuming of course the forensic scientist moderates the pace of the presentation and discussion.

The biggest thing I dislike about the game are the yellow tiles that describe the crime scene. Some are completely useless and does not help solving the clue. In fact, for the most part, the cause of death or location are the keys to identifying the crime. Beyond that, many of the scenario tiles weren't especially helpful and were often ignored. Many of our deductions mainly centered on the cause of death and location.

This game likely stays in my collection due to the player count. Otherwise, I prefer Resistance or Coup to scratch my social deduction itch.

Fun bluffing game that does away with player elimination. Instead, the whole game evolves into a court room as players accuse each other of being the murder. Personally, I love playing the forensic scientist the most as I'm not the greatest liar, but watching the tension grow as players try to isolate the two murder items is one of the most tense and enjoyable aspects of the game.

Excellent murder solving, clue giving, social detection game.  Concept is players play one of a several roles types. One of you is a murderer.  The murderer selected a means and a clue card.  The investigator knows who the murderer is and what they selected.  They have to, without using their mouth, place indicators on clue boards to help drive the investigators to the right means and clue cards.  All the while, the murderer is amongst your team, throwing them off and being deceptive.

I am just plain bad at being an investigator, and it's not a lot of fun for me.  I've been the Forensic Scientist once, and I like that experience a lot more, trying to get people to guess what you are telling them with 2 "good" clues, and 4 "bad" clues that you don't really get to pick (the brown clue cards that people keep assuming "oh, he just has to pick one of those, it doesn't mean anything", and you have to stop yourself from yelling at them that it's a good clue!!).  It's a good amount of stress and thinking.

1st impression: Balance issues. Nice idea, keen to try again but I doubt my rating will improve. If you have less than 8 players then just play Mysterium (admittedly this is much quicker with a low player count) - more than 8 then the balance shifts to the murderer too hard? Less than 6 it's too easy to catch the murderer - maybe need to deal out more cards?

I've played this one now for about 5 times. There is something missing in my opinion. In each round we have played so far, I always got the feeling that I had absolutely no clue about what the weapon and evidence could be... I don't know but I think it is way too hard to figure it out especially since the hint tables of the scientist are really shallow. 
I really tried to like this because I like hidden roles and deception games but this one is not for me.

Just doesn't grab me like many similar games (Dixit, Mysterium, Resistance, or even Concept) have.  On the plus side its quite quick to play, but I don't find it nearly as engaging as the alternatives.

Still feeling this game out a bit.  I think it's a mad concatenation of the best parts of many games, sounds perfect... but my experiences have been a bit mixed.  I've had it fall really flat and no one get into it. I've had people repeatedly guess the murderer within a minute, and I've had people never even get close to the murder weapons.

Great party and deduction game. Currently the best of its kind as it has an easily scalable difficulty and the gamemaster(forensic scientist) also has an interesting task. It is a bit like mixing werewolf and Mysterium and takes the best of both worlds.

For me it's a 7.5 and for my wife it's a 9.5. So behold an 8.5. My wife loves the theme and the easiness to get into it. She loves solving the crimes, trying to read her murderous friends' expressions. I'd have to admit it's pretty fun, although I usually desire a little more complexity. This game plays best with at least 5 people, but fun can still be had with 4.

Simple clue-giving game that's a spinoff of [gameid=925].  It's unlikely to change your world, but it works for the same reason that its parent game works.  Somebody's lying, and trying to catch them in that lie is fun, and trying to get away with it is fun.

The game does have a niggling feeling of being just a bit off.  It's really important in communication games like this to get the feel and the vocabulary perfect, and there are some aspects  of the game that are just a little bit off due to translation issues.  A bit more care with the localization efforts from Chinese to English would have alleviated some of these issues.

Refreshingly different from other social deduction games, and might end up being my favorite of them all. My one tweak to the rules is to have only ONE round of everyone presenting their case for 30 seconds instead of three, which is just too many. This tightens the game up and makes it actually take the 20 minutes it says on the box.

An excellent deduction game, with one person (silently) serving as the forensic scientist, giving clues on the crime at hand. With actual evidence that the players will debate, this is a satisfying narrative almost every time. Less shouty and inflammatory than something like The Resistance. Can sort of stymie discussion if new cards don't help or if a suspect starts to seem obvious.

Easy-to-explain, quick-to-set-up, free-flowing (no turn order) deduction game.  One player will be trying to provide clues for the other players to puzzle out and at least one other plater will be trying to confuse the issue by leading everyone away from the truth.

Resistance Avalon meets a deduction clue giving game. Tons of cards so replay ability is great although it may develop groupthink like Dixit if overplayed (but the expansion fixes all that with so much more variety and new roles/events).

With the expansion there are now so many cards/roles/tiles/special events that the game is always new. This is, in my opinion, the best social deduction game out there. It transcends the normal finger pointing accusations of the other games and makes players think, role play, and deduce in a way that makes people want to come back time and time again.

Completely arbitrary deduction.  If the murderer has significantly unique items, it sometimes limits the choices down to a single player immediately.  Most of the time, the cards are narrowed down to one or two sets, so a team of investigators can eliminate one option to identify that the solution is the other option.

I prefer many other hidden traitor deduction games.

RATING: 4
Played in two 8-player games, once as an accomplice and once as an investigator. Both games ended abruptly after brief discussions because the very first weapon/evidence guesses were correct.

The local party gamers love it, but I don't need to play again.  I'd rather concoct a real murder where I "accidentally" ski across someone's face.

I'll eventually sell the book rights, so the jail time will ultimately be worth it.

Decent game, but I suspect it's more fun as the forensic scientist or the murderer because you won't spend the game feeling like you have no idea what's going on.

A really good social deduction game that borrows some elements from Resistance, Werewolf and Mysterium. It plays really quickly too, we got through a play in around 10-15 minutes once we got going with 4 players. I'd like to try this with 6 and I wonder if 8+ will bog down too much due to the sheer number of options that would be available in a game with that many cards on the table.

First off, I would like to give Grey Fox Games a shoutout for quickly addressing and replacing the missing role cards that were not in my copy. This game has definitely delivered for my game group and we usually start with this or end the night with it. Everyone enjoys being any of the roles, but especially the Forensic Scientist or Murder. At the end of the game, we have the murder give us a story on the two items but also what story the Forensic Scientist was trying to tell as well.

Wonderful hidden loyalty, and social deduction game. To me there's a lot more engaging gameplay here than in most of the Werewolf/Resistance style game. This was one of those games which I had to play again right after my first play, and then again after that.

RATING: 9.9
This is a FANTASTIC party game!  It's a bit loose on the rules (not that the're vague or anything - just easily augmented with house rules for preference), but the experience is fun each time.  
The Method and Clue cards can be somewhat odd, and when randomly dealt out, they make for a sometimes brief game since solving the murder can become quite obvious.  The key in this game, and the actual hardest part of it, is DECIDING which combination you wish to use if you are lucky enough to be the murderer.  It's a very intense decision that can often dictate how the game plays out.  But that's what makes it fun!  If, like the rules suggest, you take the time to look at everyone's panel of cards BEFORE obtaining your roll (ie before you even know if you are the murderer), you can really get a feel for your [possible] opponents - allowing you to make a decision based on their thought processes rather than just randomly winging it with a choice that could be obvious to another player.  
My only complaint (and its VERY minor) is that the category cards seem limited...  I expect this was purposeful, since some of them already seem redundant.  However, I easily overlook that because, in practice, they are ALL equally useful and useless.  Its quite dependent on what combination of clues the Forensic Scientist is working with and what players are actually saying.  This is a game that provides so little framework that games can play out drastically different depending purely on WHO you are playing the game with.  
Another word of caution. At first, I was inclined to try and explain all the "rules" before playing.  This is a MISTAKE!!!!
Instead, what i found worked much better was to decide that who ever had played the game before could be the forensic specialist (including myself) and simply tell everyone new about the *single accusation* rule (turning in your badge to make the accusation) This does mean that new players are starting off almost devoid of understanding.  But, since you will get the dynamic of the game very quickly by being one of the investigators, this is one of the few instances where [with the exception of the Forensic Scientist] playing the game actually is an easier way of teaching the game than to simply try and explain it.  If EVERYONE is new to the game, make sure one player reads all the rules and knows them well, then let that person be the Forensic Scientist/specialist.
I hope they expand this game further - even if all it does is add more cards for both the investigators/specialist, it would still add even more to the game.  As is though, the game is near perfect!

This is a game that requires a good group for best results. A lot of people have a hard time with the "courtroom" aspect where everyone gets 30secs to share their thoughts on who is the murderer and who isn't. However, with the right group, this game is amazing. We have had some incredible plays where the murderer was almost caught but managed to divert suspicion to someone else, or where someone comes completely out of left field with a combination that catches the murderer, or when the murderer and accomplice snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by finding the witness. A great large-group game!

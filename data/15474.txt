 nice tension 
 quick, fun gameplay
-game box(size and quality) and manual(some things are not clear)
-card quality (cards tend to bend)
-icons with card functions could be better

I bought it after Zombiaki 2 and honestly I've never played it. Both games are almost the same (they only differ with couple of cards), so I prefer to play better looking one (Zombiaki 2).

RATING: 6
A neat zombie game that captures the siege narrative of many zombie films that most games never approach.  In some ways it plays similar to NEUROSHIMA HEX but in linear fashion.  Quality is about on par with a Cheapass game but I found it to be more enjoyable than most of the Kosmos 2 player line.  It's very quick, very thematic, and worth a couple of plays for the horror game fan.

Now, after 50 plays, or even more, I consider this game predictable and slightly boring. But this is after 50 plays, and I wouldn't have played it so much if I had considered it to be boring from the very beginning, right?

I like the the idea and theme of Zombiaki. It's Human vs. Zombies in a 2 player card game standoff. But while playing it, I didn't really feel like I was making any meaningful decisions. I guess this game is all about the experience.

I would love to see what Knizia would make out of this setting.

Fun undead themed slug-fest. Seems like Humans have the advantage, but that gets mitigated a lot by luck of the draw. Doesn't bother me, but for folks that get homicidal when they roll continuous 1's in Risk...probably wouldn't like this game either.

Confrontational and very thematic game!

As it plays on an imaginary grid, you see the zombies advancing turn after turn while the human player tries desperately to shoot, burn, bomb or block them down before they break into his barricade. 

Zombiaki is my favorite zombie game up-to-date.

With difficulty to rate this game. Pointlessly simple, almost schematic, in sum quickly is bored, but when already will take place one party, one is a readiness on following and following. The greatest delight causes playing with people, is quite a lot combinings and the excitement. Instead zombii are terribly boring, because the all strategy is based on the set their as many you can on the board. Some rules are strange or half-baked, similarly as cards. Generally the I play in Zombiaki as I have a suitable mood.

RATING: 5.9
Surprisingly good. Fast, you can feel the theme. 

Quality of the cards is rather poor, similar to my self-made Battleline, and that's really not to good... But on the other hand the game is extremely cheap, so I'm not complaining any more.

Good thing is, that after some harsh opinions about the readability of the cards, their special powers and the rulebook, the publisher did actually make some changes, answering the fans.

Make the quality of the game components better, add tokens and a little board, and you can have something like Condotierre or Lost Cities but with a much more interesting background theme :-)

+0,1 for the zombie theme :zombie:

RATING: 7
I am really glad I traded for this when I had the chance. This game plays in about thirty minutes (if that), and is full of tension. The zombie player is racing to get his zombies up the "board", and the human player is just hoping to keep them at bay long enough for the sun to come up. Easy to learn, and interesting choices come up in every game. The only draw back I would say is that the end is kind of predictable in the latter part of the game as the decks get smaller and smaller. If there was a way to hide the number of cards the zombie player had left I think it would make it much more intense. Overall though this truly is a winner.  

Recommendation for Possible Future U.S. Publisher: 
Make the cardstock much thicker, and increase the card size to standard deck size.

A 2-player card game with zombies advancing toward the barricaded humans, who are doing their best to stop the advancing hordes.  Lots of special effect cards showing typical actions from zombie movies.

Amusing, quick, nice art.  Polish text on the cards, but good icons remind you of what each card does.  It plays well and fast, and seems reasonably balanced.

Mechanically it's like a weird cross between Neuroshima Hex (draw up to 4 cards, discard one, play or hold the others) and Lord of the Rings: Confrontation (the fellowship of the zombies tries to get past the humans' barricade at Mordor...)

The rules are a bit frustratingly unclear in places, and the English translation leaves out info from the Polish original, but most questions are eventually solvable.

RATING: 5
A funny two player game, which places one player in control of an endless stream of Zombies whilst the other player controls Humans, trying to defend their barricade against the undead invasion. 

The game's downside is that it is very hard to defend the human barricade and if the human player chooses a different strategy than stalling the Zombies, they will most definitely loose (Humans win if the Zombie player draws the Dawn card, which is always the very last card of the Zombie Deck).

Therefore this is more a Dawn of the Dead kind of game, where you have to wait it out till the morning. If You're more into The Walking Dead and would like to get to kill Zombies, I would suggest playing Zombicide instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fast and funny game for 2 players. Rules are easy, but you must search the rulebook all the time to see what each card can do. You also need some luck to win, especially if you play humans, because zombies are a bit overpowered and more likely to be victorious.

Simple,light game that you can take to school/job and play with friends within a 15 min break. The ruls are uncomplicated and easy to teach. Gameplay is smooth and there is even some space for strategy although its still mainly based on luck. It's slightly boring after 40 or so games, but the price is low so altogether: good game :)

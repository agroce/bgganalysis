This is a pretty good game.  You'll be overwhelmed by trying to work out the best way to deliver your contracts..  But the bits are cool and it feels a little different from other pick up and deliver network games.
I like the cut-throat ending mechanic.

A fast, fairly light route building/commodities train game here. I've got a few quips with some of the graphic design and components, but it does fill in a gap between family games like Ticket to Ride and heavier systems like Steam. Actions are easy to explain and there are a few neat little mechanics like how the market values can shift rows and trains already on the tracks can get free pushes along at the start of turns.

It is more difficult than ticket to ride because it has more strategies. It has some of the uncertainty of Union Pacific, but it could have been better. The game is a lot of bungling at that's a pity.
Only the third game after searching on BGG I had the rules right. And the game became worse. After delivering the 4 (and not more)commidities everybody had only one thing to do : build track. So no one moved his train anymore and we all were waiting for the end where nothing changed. So I have lowered my score from 7 to 5.

This game had so much potential. I had to try it from the description. It's a Frankenstein's monster of a train game. It's a mash up of many popular train game mechanisms. Unfortunately, it doesn't come together all that well. Having only one action per turn was a mistake in my opinion. Especially considering what your options for an action are. For example, moving your train onto a track is a turn. Extreemly unsatisfying. I doubt train game players will appreciate this game and it is too light and slow developing to keep the attention of gamers for long. The rule book is vague in reference to train movement. I hope we played this wrong.

First play I felt there is something there but the rules really dragged it down and it became frustrating.  I'd play it again, maybe.  This would go no higher than a 6 or so.  It feels like a crayon game mixed with TtR.

Played a 4 player game.  Great game that I didn't know about.  I love that it is a cross between Ticket to Ride and Empire Builder.  3 new players, teaching and playing game in less than 90 minutes.  Fantastic game.

Second game, 4 player, ended with scores of 39, 38, 38, 37.  The winner strategy was to not deliver commodities or move the train, only 1 train move the whole game.  He built track and received many $3 goods from the market and completed his route card.  Shows that the game can be won in a way that no one has seen before.

This is a nice step up from ticket to ride where it adds in pick-up and deliver to the game.  While initially it seems like you can't cut people off much if you are not careful you will find yourself spending lots more cards than you need to in order to lay the track you want.  Plus with the soft end game trigger the last round can be very tense.

A simple, shorter stepchild of Empire Builder, this is a train game where you're delivering goods around a board.   Unlike Empire Builder though, you'll be lucky to deliver even a small number of goods.

The pacing just seemed off in our initial play of this one.   Just when you were starting to get going, the game ends.

I played this at Geekway to the West, and while I can see what the designer was trying to do, I will not willingly play this game again. I would rather play a straight out crayon rail game or Ticket to Ride. 

It felt like they were trying to meld these 2 games, but not catching the "!!!!!" that I get from either of them.

Things that ruined it for me: 

Bad rule book - in an effort to make it accessible some of the rules had been left out. Even with our ability to look up things on BGG, the rules were very frustrating.

Fiddly pieces - OK the track pieces are cute. But super annoying, it took just that extra moment to fit the train into the track, every damn time, every turn. ARGH. Plus they were just slightly too big.

Not enough cards - The whole "go through the deck 3 times, than shuffle these 3 cards into it" just felt messy. 

So I guess what bothered me most about this game was its lack of elegance. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I was not a fan of this game. 

Firstly, the game is unbalanced from the start. The initial delivery cards that you are given predetermine your maximum possible score. I realized about 10 minutes into the game, that it was possible for me to complete the highest valued route on every card and still lose, just because other people had a higher possible max score. 

Additionally, I'm sure some people found the train tracks and the little train mover to be nice. I just found it fiddly. I'm a rather clumsy individual, and I could not get my engine to stand on top of the track. I kept knocking everything over. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial impression:  The game very much owes a debt to Ticket to Ride.  Mr. Glenn simplified some of the base TtR mechanisms, then layered upgrades and pick-up-and-deliver over it all.  The track and train pieces are a bit fiddly and hard to work with, but otherwise the production is good.  I'm not sure if I'll weary of it after a handful of plays or if it's a long-term keeper yet.

RATING: 8
What an incredible game!  It combines my favorite aspects of Empire Builder within an easy to learn/play Ticket to Ride framework.

If it wasn't for the fact that I break a lot of people into gaming, Spike would totally fire Ticket to Ride, in my opinion.  This game is CRIMINALLY underrated.

Very good pick up and deliver game with some nice extra touches (commodities market) that add an extra layer.  The game moves quickly - and the end seems to arrive just as you feel you've got your engine humming.  Some points removed for the extremely fiddly bits - they look great, but in practice just move around on the board WAY too much.  There had to be a better way to implement this.  Overall, though, a fun game that's a nice step up from TTR.

2015-05-18 : We broke the game on our first play - by simply playing by the rules as printed. Talk about house-ruling this and that started already halfway throuh the game - it's that bad. Major culprit : nowhere is it stated that you can't build rails to more than one city at a time. In the rules forum the designer rectifies this, but stuff like that should have been picked up on the first playtest outside the designer's playgroup. 

Other problems : weird flow of your gameturn - first a free move, then actions ; color of the tracks on the cards doesn't match the color of the tracks on the board ; city names get obscured by the tracks (probably less of a problem for USA-nians) ; Contracts should have a visual clue of where those cities are, just like those end-game cards.

Maybe we need to play this again with the corrected rules but with so many games ready and waiting, why bother ?

Yet another Ticket to Ride Variant but we have had good luck with them.  Africana is quite different enough and enjoyable to play and this one is the same.  Different enough that you don't even think TtR.

Trying to maximize resource sales and make your route card before timer(card stack) runs out.  Really a quick and easy game to play. Some tension as routes cannot be shared.  Being able to use more track of one color for the other mitigates card luck.  Nice design!

Spike has all the feel of a first design, it's very derivative (Transamerica, Ticket to Ride) with some complexities tacked on, I was quite surprised to see that Stephen Glenn was the designer. What happens here is that you draw cards from a face up selection, use them to build tracks between cities (sound familiar?) then move your train to pickup and deliver goods for money/VP.
In spite of the above, this is much better than I expected, it's sort of an optimisation puzzle where you check at the start where cargo is available and where it needs to go for maximum return, then execute your strategy hoping not to be blocked by opponents. The card deck is exhausted quickly, there's certainly no outstayed welcome. A bit of a sleeper, I didn't expect to want to play again, but I do.

RATING: 7.2
My first instinct is to say this is a mash-up of Ticket to Ride with pick-up & deliver plus a dash of Transamerica; an interesting mix of light, medium, and heavy games.  While there are definitely those similarities here, once you start playing you'll find that it plays quite differently than you'd expect.  For one, you get only one "ticket" and three/four deliveries (depending on player count) for the entire game and if you're not careful you'll either short-change yourself and deliver them too cheaply too early or you'll run out of time and miss deliveries.  You need to play through once to understand the pace of the game and even then, knowing how the other players pace themselves will help immensely. 

I do have a few issues with the game. For one, this is NOT a game for the AP prone. There may only be a few things going on at once but they're logistical and take some thought and consideration, especially once you're first dealt your cards. The AP prone individual(s) will cause the game to drag. 

Next you'll notice is that it's definitely fiddly.  The rails, once placed flat on the board or table are nearly impossible to pick up!  The tracks are easily bumped and shifted on the board (don't bump the table or game-over!) and the train doesn't sit nicely on them either.  It's actually quite annoying IMO. I think flat cardboard rails would have been much better suited.

My third issue is that your deliveries and your route card may be in completely opposite directions or just spread out all over the board while your opponent may get a lucky card draw and have things lined up quite nicely.  I haven't tried this yet but I plan to try it next time I play it.  I would change the set up from random delivery draw to a draft.  Deal everyone ONE random delivery card and then deal the route cards but let them pick a side. Then starting from the last player and going counter-clockwise, each player drafts another delivery, then draft the second delivery clockwise, etc. until everyone has the correct number of deliveries.  All other rules remain the same but this should help limit the luck factor. Admittedly this draft would take longer, especially with new players, but the luck balancing may be worth it.  

One final problem is that once (if) you complete your final delivery, you won't have much to do besides build meaningless routes to rack up cash. If everyone is doing this, it's a very anti-climatic ending that drags to it's conclusion.

So a lot of words about the cons but all-in-all this a pretty good game that I'm looking forward to playing again soon. I can deal with some of the issues and maybe correct the rest. The jury is still out.  If you enjoy a logistical game and like games such as TTR, Age of Steam, Railways, then this falls squarely between them in weight and you should enjoy it.

Lots to figure out in this pick-up-and-deliver train game.  You have to spend a turn to get your train going, but once it's on the track it moves for free.  The fact that your money is also your victory points makes for some hard decisions, too.

I like train games and I like money games.  When the two are combined, I'm in gaming heaven.  This is a 'must have' for my collection and well deserving of an '8' rating.

RATING: 5
Spike has the dreaded distinction of being too thinky and slow for a fun family game and having too little tension for a gamer's game. I can't see this game having an audience.

Spike takes basic Ticket to Ride card drafting as its main driver, but adds more complex connections and route goals along with goods delivery. The main problem I think is that it has the trappings of an economic train game (route building, goods delivery, train upgrades) without actually being an economic game. Money essentially equals points. You spend a few points to make upgrades, but there is no economy whatsoever.

At the beginning of the game you are given a route card and three or four goods that you alone can transport - ONCE each - during the game. The cities you can possibly deliver to are on the card and each is worth different points. So you start the game figuring out how to complete your route while delivering to higher point cities. It is a logistical puzzle to be sure, but that's the biggest decision in the game (what city do you start in and what is your expansion plan). After that the game just kind of unfolds with little interaction and zero tension.

It's weird to be building a giant rail network that one lone train travels - SLOWLY - to make its three deliveries. It's weird that the game comes with so many route cards when each player only uses one per game. And the third weird thing: I think you can get a lot more points more easily route building that you do delivering goods, which makes it feel like expansion is a purpose unto itself with no practical aim.

RATING: 7
In between Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam but closer to the former game. It’s heavily front-loaded even for a pickup-and-deliver game. In principle, players have to parse a lot of information to solve the travelling salesman problem on hand. Optimally, players combine connecting the cities from their bonus card with completing their order cards while tactically connecting cities when they are most valuable. Actually, focusing on short-term connections and tactically completing deliveries could pay out as well while dramatically reducing the barrier of getting started.

An enjoyable game for fans of the genre that’s hampered a bit by the slow progress towards the long-term goals and fiddly handling of the track tiles and locomotives that will challenge some of the clumsier players.

It's Ticket to Ride with a pick up and deliver mechanism attached on the side. The grid on the map is more known from Transamerica on the other hand. Each player has four tickets, one hidden and three open ones. The open ones have multiple ends. The rail cards have a nice joker system and the end condition to lessen card hoarding which is nice. Major con in comparison to TtR is tragically the end condition which offers the leading player the chance to just pump cards in the end while others are possibly trying to pull up some meaningless to catch up. Due to the grid the game is also really prone to AP. On the other side of the coin the automatically moving train and the need to spend a turn to make a stopped train move again are brilliant design choices.

I love network-building games in almost every shape and form. Spike combines rail-building with pick-up and deliver as well as managing your train on the actual tracks. All combined in a medium-light package.

Spike uses also another variation on the Ticket to Ride approach of using cards as the currency to build different rails. Because you can come up with your own networks on a very dense grid, the amount of blocking between players was minimal. 

The main challenge was coming up with an optimal route, as well as managing the timing of your moving train with the rest of the actions (especially building new rail).

Two things that bugged me about this game:
- Looking at the 4 contracts you have, with 8-10 destinations each, and trying to come up with an optimal route makes my brain hurt, especially without any kind of visual representation.
- The plastic pieces used for the rail are really badly designed and are very hard to pick up with your bare fingers (everybody had this problem in my game).

The rest of the game was fine, but nothing particularly remarkable about it.

This is a mash up between TransAmerica (connecting cities with a route), Ticket to Ride ( building train routes using coloured track cards) and Railways of the World card Game (pick up and deliver goods). This plays so quickly that the experienced players insisted on playing their variant of an extra round of the game! It still accelerates and plays very fast. There is a lot of luck with the route card as you get only 1 and it may not align with any of your goods contracts - maybe draw 2 and play 1? Pieces are very fiddly as you run your tiny engine along tiny plastic tracks!
I need to play this gain to decide for myself whether the length is correct and if the route card luck is manageable without a change.

Looks and sounds like a perfectly good exercise in the route-building and pick up & deliver areas, but there are serious problems.  The distribution of secret route cards can lead to artificially lopsided scores.  The rules for train movement are very awkward and easy to forget.  Worst of all, the sudden death endgame makes the delivery/contract part of the game...which really ought to be the main course...too risky and inefficient.  It is far too easy for somebody to accelerate the game by building lots of track for quick connection bonuses while ignoring their delivery contracts, and they may even win by doing so.  "If only I had one more turn, I could have/would have/etc." is something you'll hear many times if you play Spike frequently.  It feels like you're midway through the game when POW, it's over.  It just isn't the game it appears to be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The automatic train movement is an amazingly brilliant concept, and the need to restart the train after stopping in a city adds the perfect final touch to it.

I'm not sure there's any balance or mathematical basis in the cargo tickets except for the fact that the highest prices are somewhere on the edges of the map. The route ticket deck is fantastic, though: there are 36 tickets even though only one per player is used, so memorizing the deck and guessing other players' routes is not simple.

The rulebook is a bit too brief, especially the track building would have needed a more precise presentation and good examples of certain special cases. I'm not entirely happy with the end condition either: It presumes that players will notice and tell if they get an end card from a blind draw, and also makes it too easy for the leading player to just rush through the deck.

Some uneducated choices in component quality and design:
- Low quality bendy cards.
- The train upgrade puzzle pieces do not quite fit together.
- The upgrade prices are not shown on the train pieces, even though there is lots of empty space available.
- The locomotive piece fitting exactly inside track pieces is pretty neat but in practice it is very tricky to get it to land there.
- Unnecessarily raises costs of the initial production run by having the most inefficient punchboard design ever: They have used six different cuts for what could have easily been done using three, or with some creativity maybe even only two cuts.

I'm not a train game guy but this one is really fun. It moves quickly. Turns are brief but satisfying. Goals are simple and flexible. Interaction is constant but not overly intense.

The "train just keeps moving" rule is original and clever. It feels good to get something for free on most turns! 

The art is nice, with clear colors and symbols and good atmosphere. Component quality is great too. The jigsaw expando-trains are loco!

Cute set collection rail builder. There are way too many special route cards. If there were only 7-10 well selected routes then it would still allow for variability without inadvertently causing clumping. We played a 4 player game where everyone had to build to the NE to score. We were thinking about how if 3 of us where there and another was out west, they would rule the game with little interference, while other players would be buried in a dog pile.

The special rule is really confusing. You never have to stop in a city that you don't want to deliver to. So the rule for moving trains should be that you always get to move your train if in motion until you want to stop in a city to deliver. Then you take an action to pick up goods and move again.

I would have to play this more, but I can't help but feel that the payouts seem really extreme between cities. It is really clear by the last shuffle near the endgame whether or not you are going to compete in the game or not. Maybe one or two players will be able to make an important last delivery, but the system just fizzles when there is no follow through for your loads. As a result the ending feels anti-climactic.

The pieces are super cool in isolation, but they are an absolute dog to use. The plastic slides all around the gloss board, the trains can barely stand up on their own and then you have to try to stack them. One person would only play the game with the condition that other players manipulate his pieces. I'd probably give the game a 6.5 if the pieces didn't actively interfere with playability.

This is a very good medium weight train game.  It is certainly a step up from Ticket to Ride in terms of complexity, but it is easy to teach and fun to play.

Fun railroad building pick up and deliver game. Not sure I need it in my collection but won't turn down a play of it.

Only downside is the board/components are just not top notch. The plastic pieces are too big for the paths on the board and one bump can send things into a jumble. A bigger board with more space to lay tracks would be an improvement.

This is a pretty nice streamlining of the crayon rail pick-up-and-deliver games, although I prefer Empire Express. The mechanics here work, but it doesn't seem to be very well balanced: too much randomness in the initial distribution of routes and, especially, contracts. There is a pretty wide range of contract values, with some worth much less than others; it's possible a bunch of these end up with one person while the other(s) get the cheap ones. Nor can I tell if there are multiple paths to victory here: can someone compete if they (mostly) ignore contracts and instead concentrate on track building?

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
[u]Setup[/u]
- Randomly distribute the 12 goods tokens into the chart on the board.
- Shuffle track deck, place 4 in display.
- Place the 3 game timer cards on the track on the board, the first one face up.
- Each player:
... gets a random contract showing a starting city, an end city, and several cities along the way. At end of game, earn $ based on city furthest along path to which you connected, +$1 per city along the way.
... gets 3, 4, or 6 (4, 3, or 2 players) contracts, all of which correspond to a different type of good. Contracts have several possible destinations, paying more $ for more distant deliveries.
... gets 5 random track cards; 1st player gives one to last player
... sets up their train: level 1 engine (moves 1 space), level 2 card drawing, one cargo space
... in turn order, players place their loco in any starting city

[u]Your Turn[/u]
- If you have a train on the tracks, advance it up to a number of spaces equal to engine level (1 at first; max 3).
... Move only along your own tracks. 
... May not change direction while on track.
... As you move, may jump over cities you don't want to enter.
... If you enter a city, may deliver a good on your train; earn $ according to value showing on contract. 
... You may only deliver to any particular city ONCE; may only deliver each type of good ONCE.
- Take one action:
... start train moving (up to your engine level)
... draw cards (up to your card drawing power); may draw from display and/or deck; only replenish display at end of your turn
... build track: play track cards corresponding to tracks on the board; must build a complete link to a city. May play n+1 cards of one type, to count as n cards of another type. The first time you connect to a city, move the corresponding track marker to the bottom row of the chart; earn $1-3 depending on which row the marker started on. Shift the other markers up to fill in the empty space.
... move train one additional space

[u]Game End[/u]
- When the draw deck runs out, flip the next round marker card face up. Shuffle the Display and the discard pile and create a new Display and draw deck.
- When the 3rd timer is face up, shuffle all 3 into the bottom half of the new draw deck. When the 3rd card is drawn, the game ends immediately.
- The player with the most money (tracked on score track) wins.

Easy and accessible train / pick-up & deliver game. Fine enough thematically, intuitive basic economy and fun bits creating track and moving about them. Gets repetitive though.

Not a heavy game, but some confusing, non-intuitive rules, like only being allowed to deliver once to a city, which the little check marks for the demand card confuse by only marking one of the demand cards; the city isn't marked. Also, only once per contract card. You can skip through cities with no movement loss, but the city acts like an extra piece of track when you pick up or deliver. Maybe I find the rules confusing just because of playing the Empire Builder (EB) series a lot.

The 3-5 Contract cards and the Route cards are a lot to process at the start of the game. On the other had, you have no real choice but to deliver to the three highest contract amounts, or nearly.

Spike seems desperate to be like but different from EB, Ticket to Ride, and TransAmerica/Europa. This makes the board a bit of a mess, visually; the plastic track bits a very much harder to handle than either TtR trains or TransX's (or On the Underground's) usual wooden sticks; but they have to have train-building cards and two types of routes like TtR.

It has the same baby-step feel as Ticket to Ride: all you do is draw two cards again and again at the beginning and inch your train one step per turn. It thankfully accelerates, but the baby-step beginning is painful. But the balance of actions is good: I rarely had a spare action to push my train an extra space; I had to keep building out my network.

I'm not sure the weird cards do anything for the game; the wild card rules are so easy, that it's almost impossible to get stuck as in TtR. I think I might enjoy the game more if I were just placing track instead of drawing cards to place track, though maybe that's my pro-EB/anti-TtR bias. It needs a rule to prevent blocking, maybe no more than three tracks of a color in an intersection.

A bit Ticket to Ride, a little Empire Builder, a smattering of Age of Steam, Spike is a clean route-building and pick-up-and-deliver design that remains accessible to many players like Ticket to Ride but has a bit more going on that should satisfy gamers seeking a little more challenge. The track pieces can be a bit fiddly, but they look nice and there's little else to complain about here. I found Ticket to Ride a bit too simple for my tastes and so far have found Spike to be more engaging.

Spike is a bit of an odd game. My reaction immediately after playing the game was very negative... but upon reflection I think that's largely due to the fact that I completely misunderstood the game.

I went into this game thinking that this would be somewhat like other train games and that delivering stuff would be a big part of the game. That was a fundamentally flawed assumption. The most deliveries anyone made in the game was 3, and that was the player who finished last. The player who made the fewest deliveries, which was 1, came in second.

My assumption that I would be making a lot of deliveries meant that I spent a lot of time trying to figure out a really complicated plan for how to make multiple deliveries at the beginning of the game, something that I found to be insanely hard to calculate. I usually don't enjoy games where you have to decide your entire plan in the game before turn one and you're pretty much locked into that strategy before the game starts. And that's really what I thought this game was going into it.

The game has 12 commodities. Each player (at least in a four player game) got 3 commodities randomly. Those commodities are locked in as yours, no other player will ever do anything with them. Each commodity comes with a contract card showing possible cities that you could deliver that good to and each city has a different payout value.

The board is a map of Eastern US and each city is tied to a particular commodity that it produces. Generally the farther you have to travel to deliver a commodity, the more it pays you (with $20 being about the highest reward I saw). So there's no variable setup in this game, as all the contract cards are (at least in theory) balanced so that the places you pick up a good from are an appropriate distance away from the cities that pay well for delivering that good.

At the beginning of the game you also get a route bonus card that gives points at game end for having a connection to every city in your route and a special bonus depending on how far you get along that route. In the advanced variant you get to choose from a couple of cards, but we played where we just got a route with no choice. Which was a little annoying as most of my goods weren't near my route.

To build track, you collect cards and then spend them in a way very reminiscent of Ticket to Ride. The card deck also triggers the end of a round, with the game lasting 3 rounds. To deliver a good, you move your train along your track according to it's engine speed, but once you're out of a city, you'll get a free movement every turn. You can upgrade your train to move faster and to allow you to draw more cards.

There's also a connection bonus you get for building into cities which depends on the good type of that city. Basically all the goods are grouped into sets of three and randomly start with one good type at $3, $2 and $1. When you connect to a good type you get the money it is currently set at and then it gets reset to $1, pushing the other goods up.

At the beginning of the game, I knew that my route was from Mobile to St. Paul. And I needed to pickup and deliver Steel, Coal and Fruit. But you can never deliver to the same city twice. So I started trying to figure out complex scenarios of how I could set up a delivery chain that would let me deliver a bunch of times. Which is tricky, as each contract card of mine had four or five different possible locations I could deliver a good to. And those destinations paid out anything ranging from $3 to $17. But some destinations were worse because they weren't the right good I needed to pick up. And they weren't close to anything I needed to pick up for my other cards. And the goods I needed, weren't close to my route.

I kept trying to figure out which starting city I would choose, where I could deliver those goods to, and how I'd pick up more stuff, and how I could pick a second destination that would let me deliver my second good for lots of money, but also let me pick something else up, and then be set to get to a third delivery city, and then be able to repeat the process. I very quickly got bogged down to the point that I couldn't figure anything out and just decided to start on a simple delivery from Little Rock to Mobile and then decide how to proceed from there.

I was still thinking I'd be making a bunch of deliveries at that point. It took me until about halfway through the game before I realized I would struggle to make a second delivery. And by that point I had already done a bunch of silly stuff, like upgrading my engine, under the idea that I'd be delivering several times.

Another player went with a strategy of only doing one really long delivery, never upgrading his train, and just connecting to cities on his route and ones that paid well for the connection bonus. Which meant that he avoided all the calculations I tried to figure out at the beginning of the game.

I think if I had realized that I'd only be making a delivery or two in the game, and could have avoided trying to overthink the setup of the game, that I would have had a much better experience in the game. I also would have played the early game much differently. So my initial impression of the game was probably overly harsh.

Aside from the game itself, I didn't particularly care for the aesthetics of the game. The board is a little overwhelming with every hex on the board having six connections out of it, each potentially a different color and line type, all against a very yellowish (or maybe yellow-greenish?) background. It made for a very busy and unattractive board. And the rail tokens were little plasticky things that nobody liked.

Overall, this isn't a game I'm going to ever love. It's basically a step up from Ticket to Ride. But a weird step up. It adds a lot of complications that make it math-ier but I don't think it's particularly much more deeper than TtR.

I like how the free movement provides momentum for the train. Otherwise it seems like an interesting track building, pick up and delivery game. I like it in general.

I have read the rules and gleaned that it pays out points/money in several dimensions

** pick up and delivery for contracts that specify various products

** route building to fufill connections specified by an assignment card

** a mechanism that fluctuates the pay rate  for merely connecting certain cities at the best paying moment

all of which I can find attractive. The question is whether it is so much spread among these that any one item is diluted to being only a small snippet such that overall it feels unsatisfying in combination.

Table time desired for further discovery.

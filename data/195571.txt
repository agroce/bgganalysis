RATING: 7.5
I had a lot of fun playing this Legendary Encounters game set on the Firefly universe. I played Legendary: A Marvel Deckbuilding Game and I think the mechanics works bether in the Firefly universe. Not that it is a greatly thematic game at all, but there are good flavor and reference in the missions of the episodes from the series.

It doesn't mean that people that never watched Firefly wouldn't enjoy the game, but certainly the references would please more the players who watched it.

Talking about the game mechanics, the game is a full coop game, that utilizes a deckbuilding mechanism signature of the other Legendary games. It is interesting and fun, with a great dose of difficulty.

The components are not that great, though, the cards have different print color patterns, even the same copy of a card have different color patterns, and I found it bizarre.

But overall, a good game, I want to play it again.

RATING: 8.2
This game is famous for its bad artwork, but I find that underneath the rough and inconsistent art, there is something, uhm, shiny. The mechanics are pretty easy to explain and feel engaging. It is not the most sophisticated system ever, but it works. The Firefly theme is very strong, and makes you want to watch the series once again with each play. The only downside (apart from the sometimes not so pretty artwork) is that you see a lot of the same cards over and over again in a game, which bores after a while.

RATING: 7.9
The episodic nature of this Legendary Encounters game is very fitting to the show it's based on, and in truth this is a really fun way to experience the system, especially if you like the original stories. HOWEVER...the art here is a huge problem...mediocre at best and downright embarrassing on some cards. I'd say a good 15-20% of the cards are plain ugly and jarring next to others. So Alien and Predator are just aesthetically more pleasing to me, even though this competes on a  pure game play level. Not sure how often it would come out over the Firefly board game or RPG, but I'll hang on to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.28
I love the Firefly theme and hoped I would enjoy this despite not loving Marvel Legendary. That was not the case. I just don't enjoy the Legendary system for deckbuilding. This game was also a nightmare to set up and tear down. It wasn't a bad game, but it definitely wasn't one worth keeping long-term.

RATING: 8.5
Worst art, but the best implementation of the Ip out of all the LE games. Quite true to the source material - and a fun option to play a campaign
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is my first Legendary Encounters (LE) game. It's fine. The LE system maintains the simple mechanisms that form the heart of deck-builders and adds on an interesting narrative aspect as you play. The campaign mode is fairly simplistic, and is basically an afterthought. LE: Firefly is a good experience that will warrant the shelf space for awhile. It's well worth the $30 I paid.

Coming from other co-op deckbuilders like Shadowrun: Crossfire, this game is quite easy. I'm not sure why people find LE: Firefly to be overly difficult. Maybe it doesn't scale as well at higher play counts (I've only played with 1 or 2 players) or requires smart choices on main/secondary characters. 

I put this close to Shadowrun: Crossfire for my desire to play. I do prefer the combat mechanisms in Shadowrun: Crossfire more than LE: Firefly. However, I prefer LE: Firefly's episodic-driven narrative over the crossfire deck & shadowrun card in Shadowrun: Crossfire. If I want a more narrative-driven, easier going deck-building game, I'll go with LE: Firefly. If I want a more difficult game with a more fleshed out campaign, I'll go with Shadowrun: Crossfire. Overall, Shadowrun: Crossfire will likely get played more often than LE: Firefly in the long term.

Update Jan. 2018: I pulled this one off the shelf again after I played Xenoshyft a few times since I wanted to compare the two. I prefer Xenoshyft. Either Firefly is a mediocre version of Legendary Encounters, or I'm not its intended audience. The difficulty takes too long to ramp up (it's only touch and go in Episode 3) and the purchase decisions during the game seem way too constrained.

Only played solo, about 2.5 games. The third got interrupted and had to be packed up before I could record where I was.

I love the theme, not the artwork, and the gameplay was very fitting for the theme. I feel like I could sit and binge this game with the show easily.

I love Marvel Legendary, I rate it a 10. This version takes the same mechanics and adds a couple of weird things to it (the ship and crew strikes) not to mention that the character you play does not give you access to that characters cards. Even with that, it is a tense and fun co-op deckbuilder. I love how the game plays though the episodes in order. I see myself soloing through this very soon.

I love firefly/serenity and I really wanted to enjoy this,  I could appreciate the mechanics and gameplay. And yes it had lots of details from the game in it, tying it to the stories - but it still felt absolutely atmosphereless (at least to me),  Maybe story driven card games aren't me.

Nice thematic deck-builder that I heard a lot of good about. I would be as thrilled for the Alien-version (with the Predator-version placed last on the list) but this is my favorite of the themes in the Legendary Encounter-series. 

However the cards are not that good-looking so I feel I might want to try it and see before I go for the uglier Firefly with a theme I like more rather than the beautiful Aliens. Also it is the matter of this being some kind of deck-builder.

(Tentative rating after two plays)

Much like LE Alien & Predator but with Enough changes that make it unique to Firefly. Mechanism feels a little more stop/start after each episode, but the crew/ship strikes are cool. 

I’d agree with the general opinion that some of the artwork (especially crew strike deck) is below expectations however it doesn’t impact gameplay. 

Very keen to get more games behind me for a solid review.  Very difficult but fun so far!

Judging solely on the game mechanics, this is a continued improvement on the legendary encounters system. The addition of the ship, as well as a more thematic objectives deck, make this game a lot of fun to play. However, as I',m sure many people have said, the artwork can really take you out of the game and leave you wondering "who actually approved this?"

A lot of people complain about the art in this game, but what they should be doing instead is play it - because it's great!
The characters feel different from one another, the episodes feel thematic, the whole game feels very Firefly - but I guess you need to know the show to really feel it.

The game play is pretty fun and the theme hits home very nicely. A few things detract from the game: 
1) the art is pretty dreadful
2) the rulebook is pretty bad - I suggest the Ant Labs playthrough for learning the game (I've found previous Legendary rulebooks to be somewhat unapproachable)
3) it has fairly high setup/takedown time

1 & 2 could be fixed, 3 is pretty much the nature of the beast.

I look forward to playing this more

After one play I am pleased with the game-play and the feel for the Verse - really captures it well and the little tweaks to the Legendary system are clever. Four plays now and it's a good rendition of Firefly via the Legendary engine.

Some of the art though is woeful - strike/flaw/Shiny cards are the worst offenders - Upper Deck should have enough resources to do better than this with a well known IP.

RATING: 6
Coop Ascension, that's the best comparison i can make. As a deck builder it felt a little insubstantial, draft cards to get cash to draft more cards or do damage, get some good combos and bonus where you can, attack the most dangerous enemies. It works quite well as a light Firefly play through. It follows the tv series chronologically and represents it about as well as one can within the deck building format.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Horrible, ugly art aside, the game feels unfair with 5 players. I don't mind a difficult co-op, but too often the game can setup an unwinnable scenario that leaves players with nothing to do but be spectators as the game plays itself. It seems that all positive reviews are either from players using house rules to "fix" the game balance or players who are playing with less than 5.

I'm a fan of the [b]Legendary Encounter [/b]games having the [b]Alien [/b]and [b]Predator [/b]ones. I'm also a Firefly fan so this was a fairytale marriage except that some old crone cast an evil spell on the artwork and now, while I love my bride, I can't look her in the face.

That is, a lot of the art is truly laughably bad. Like 9th grade study hall bad. Art is subjective and I know some of you out there think it's fine, [i]Really it's fine![/i], but some of us have more discerning tastes. I pretty much avoid looking at the art and just glean the information. It still renders a thematic experience for me in the unique way that the LE system does. A card might be a character, an item, or a moment from the show; just brilliant.

And they continue to impress me with how they're able to vary this system. The best innovation IMO is the addition of Talent and Flaw cards. Talents, when drawn, activate a special ability your character has. You may accumulate more as you play. Flaws are the inverse and activate a character weakness. These can also be gained during play and clog up your deck (though they're one and done). Jayne, for example, gets extra damage for a Talent card but when a Flaw comes into his hand, other players have to draw a strike. [i]Oh, that scoundrel![/i] In addition to you taking strikes, Serenity herself takes damage and you can lose if she's destroyed. So take care of the old girl.

You play through 3 episodes in each game. At the end of each episode, you count up how many XP you've earned and can spend them to heal yourself or repair Serenity or add cards to your hand, etc. So you get the feeling of leveling up and can even carry your characters forward into the next game (of 3 episodes) and play through all five games (of all episodes) as a campaign. As for replayability, you can mix up the episodes (just like they did on TV) and play different combinations.

- HOLY CRAP THAT ARTWORK.  Think about this...not only does the person who drew this stuff probably refer to themselves an artist, but some person, or presumably persons, sat in a room at a table together, looked at it, and said "yeah, screw it, let's go with that."

Picked up a used copy of this that my friend was getting rid of. I originally planned on getting this when it came out, but after seeing the artwork I passed. The art is just terrible. I only picked it up because it was cheap and the gameplay is OK.

I was worried about the art, but looking past that it's a really engaging and great game! The Legendary Encounters system is very simple and fun, there's something about needing to think about the order that you play your cards as well as the coop+deckbuilding combo that just clicks for me. The flaw/talent system works great and the theme is well integrated.

Surprised by this game a bit. I'm somewhat burnt out on deckbuilders, but the cooperative element made that mechanism feel fresh again. I was impressed by the ability of the game to create an atmosphere that reminds me of the episodes of the show.

I did not enjoy how important character selection is for each mission. The most efficient way to beat a difficult episode is to make sure you choose the right main characters for the specific cards in the episode deck.

The game is a good co-op deckbuilder. The co-operation usually involves players acquiring cards of different "suits" and sometimes helping each other out by using cards with assisting abilities.
What drags this game down is the really bad artwork. Score would have been higher if the artists were able to correctly draw perspective (among other things). rating would have been around 8 with decent artwork.

After a couple of games at different player counts I am a little concerned about the balance/difficulty. It feels like too much hinges on pure luck of episode card order, plus there are far too few ways to trim down your deck or unclog the bridge (market).

Obviously, it will need a few more plays before a proper verdict. Besides that, it captures the theme well and has an interesting overall approach.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the addition of having a ship to upgrade along the way.  Having the entire crew (sort of) was novel and took some getting used to.  I appreciate the attempt at a campaign, but it feels to us like there are only a few characters that work well enough across all scenarios for you to try a campaign with.  The "mild reset" between episodes during a normal game is interesting; it definitely helps take the typical end-of-game tension from the other Encounters games and lets you go through it three times every game.  Lots of great moments trying hard to finish an objective before that Inevitable card makes its way to the Combat Zone.

Gameplay: Episode-based deck builder. Big fan of Side Jobs, new system of Talent/Flaws + Avatars - it's all very thematic but brutally difficult.

Surprisingly solid game experience when considering it is mostly the same game engine as that horribly bland, dry and themeless Marvel deck builder.

Well done Upper Deck!

RATING: 7
When I saw the low average score I figured there were some art critics invading my hobby. The art isn't even bad; it's just inconsistent. It's similar to Dominion. From what I understand, the art of the comics was also inconsistent due to the range of artists hired for different installments. I'm tempted to up my rating to counter some of the simpletons judging this book by its cover but true to myself I'll be honest and give a nuanced review:

I like Firefly but I wouldn't call myself a fan by any stretch so you aren't seeing my predisposition of the theme taking over this rating. Having played Legendary and the first Encounters (Alien) game, I personally think that the system better fits a cooperative environment. The semi-cooperative nature of Legendary feels weird since you're all superheroes working together (or are you superheroes? How come we both have Spiderman in our decks?....) It brings out the worst in a competitive group, with players trailing having potentially some capability of tanking the game and making others' decks less efficient. This is more of a flaw in the new trash heap of Legendary Big Trouble in Little China. 

The Encounters system makes you a part of the game even when it's not your turn as you may see a card come up on an ally's turn that would fit your deck perfectly. Since you're all working together to beat the scenario, chances are you can get your partner to leave you that card even if it looked good for them. It feels very cooperative, and it takes the random 5 card offering first seen in Ascension and makes it strategic from a group perspective. So I like Encounters a lot more than Legendary, but what do I think about Firefly?

Let's discuss the changes and additions:

Characters: They changed the way classes work. Instead of playing with a "medic" class you will be choosing a character (Mal, Zoe, Jayce) for your class. Interestingly, you will build the crew deck out of the characters NOT in play. It's strange to be playing as Zoe and not have a single Zoe card in your deck. But there is something to like about the new character system: you now start the game with a talent card, which can be activated and then returned to the supply for an added effect. It allows you to plan when to use your big ability, but also there are certain negative effects in the strike deck that get canceled by a quick reveal of a talent card. Some other strikes force all players to discard a talent from hand. "Do I hang on to that card or play it?" is a persisting choice you may be faced with constantly the game.  Some talents are more obvious (activate to cancel a strike) while others give you a choice. There are also flaw cards that replace that force a character-specific negative event. Simply put, the flaw/talent system provides immersion and variability as different characters have a unique set of not only skills but also shortcomings. Several events will key off of certain characters being in play, which I'm sure will make fans of the show happy as they relive the episode. For me, I thought that specific feature was the weakest addition as it essentially made a certain set of characters the "ideal" crew for the scenario, which hampers replayability. On the whole I find the crew cards you'll be adding to your deck flavorless (Simon healing makes sense, but why is River milling cards in my deck?) with abilities reminiscent of established deck-building mechanisms. It does, however, provide a firm mechanical basis. 

Ship: Yep, you're on the Serenity. Thus, you'll be taking ship strikes (that's the bad damage cards) and also adding upgrades. Upgrades are purchased after finishing episodes using the credits you've acquired during the previous episode. It adds a whole extra layer to the game as you try as hard as you can to accomplish objective worth credits without losing sight of your main objective. Ship strikes are negative effects that occupy an upgrade slot and can be removed in lieu of purchasing a new crew card.  The ship was executed extremely well and greatly enabled my next point, which is...

Campaign: You can play as a campaign, conserving your ship and making decisions that will impact how you start future episodes. Progression is a welcome addition to the Encounters system. Do you deliver the medical supplies or keep them for yourself? Both have benefits so you'll need to make the call as a group.

Episodes: The structure of episodes was changed from Encounters Alien to suit the world of Firefly. Gone is the downright fear lurking around the corner with the threat of a chestburster. In fact you can even come back after you've been "knocked out". I personally like both flavors and appreciate that they didn't simply rip off of Alien Encounters by slapping a "reavers" card to imitate the chestbursters. There's a unique challenge they faced in designing the episodes: you play them in groups of three. How do you make the action rise and fall over the course of three episodes? I really don't know, but they did. The Alien movies made sense because they were full length feature films, but I'm impressed by the design of the episode decks and how their design strengthens that feeling of progression within the episode. 

Overall: Any time a game is released based on a specific system, I expect it to do something to distinguish itself. Otherwise it's a cash-in. Legendary Encounters Firefly avoids that characterization with an excellent new campaign system, a ship that progressively changes along with events and upgrades, and a slick new talent/flaw system that broadens the game in a way that feels consistent with the character development from its source material. Not all of the modifications feel welcome, such as events that always target certain characters (or whif if they aren't in play). However, as a successor to a system that tailored Marvel Legendary more to my discerning taste, I'm impressed.

This should be an automatic buy for me because my wife and I love Legendary so much, but she has NO interest in Firefly, and I doubt I'd be able to get her to play it as often as we play Marvel Legendary.

Good game with a feel of the 'verse. But the card art is a tad dark for my tastes. It's not quite in keeping with the 'verse feel which is a tad lighter. Extremely tough.

Too much luck (mostly bad) not quite enough opportunity for strategy.

Feels unbalanced. So far we are 0/2 and not looking forward to playing (i.e., losing) again.

I worry that this review might be too accurate -- https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1661844/game-basically-candyland-5-players

I also worry that you need to use the same main characters each time. From the forum, Jayne seems to be necessary.

I also think about Chvatil's feedback about Robinson Crusoe. Ignacy says "try harder" but the game doesn't allow for it. -- https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/13091/are-you-designing-game-you-better-have-vlaada-chva

This is definitely my favorite Legendary game so far. I really like that the game comes with a mat instead of a board. I wish I could convert all of my game boards into mats, but alas that is not currently possible and would probably be very expensive. But the entire layout of the Encounters series, particularly the way that you Scan the cards in the [insert name here of that thing I forget]. Damage/wounds are also dealt with in a pretty cool way. I absolutely love the Serenity upgrades in the Firefly version as well. Oh, and of course the amazing art.

RATING: 5
Played this for quite some time at GenCon 2016. The game is lacking in the excitement and fear factor that the previous Legendary Encounter games have. Firefly simply isn't "legendary" in that regard. I'd love to see Jurassic Park, Jaws, or even films like The Mummy or Men in Black in Legendary Encounter format, but from what I played with Firefly, it was too mundane to be called a Legendary Encounter game.

Legendary Encounters gameplay is as solid as ever.  Firefly adds a few tweaks.  The differences are a welcome change when we've played Alien too much but they generally make the game slower.  The art is extremely inconsistent and frequently bad and the game can often throw up impossible challenges which makes this game inferior to the Alien game.  However I'm not going to get rid of it because I do like the variety of the 15 episodes which generally all feel different.

FUN: the Firefly setting is nice, ship upgrades are a nice addition.

UNIQUE: since this is the third Legendary Encounters game, there's nothing unique about it.

NEGATIVES: it felt more static than other Legendary games. You can hardly cull your deck and the bridge doesn't seem to change that much. The art is indeed pretty bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yes the artwork is rough, but the art that doesn't depict people is great, and not all of the people are drawn horribly as some would suggest. The strike cards are the worst offenders and they have the least thematic importance of all the cards. The avatar cards, the main bad guys (Patience, Dobson, etc) are ok and keep the theme from falling flat.

So the gameplay: Episodes just work, flat out. This is a fun game to play. It has a lot of the Firefly thing going on - salvaging cargo, misbehavin' aplenty, even finding a shiny or two. As far as the incredibly played out deckbuilding genre goes, this has a lot of freshness and fun going.

RATING: 9
Mechanically this is probably the best implementation of the Legendary system, it brilliantly captures the feel of the show and allows players to recreate the stories of the episodes. Unfortunately in order to experience this greatness you have to look past the frankly abysmal art on the cards, I'm not usually a fan of screen grabs in games but in this instance I would have happily made an exception.

Preliminary rating of 5. I like the Alien and Predator versions of this system, but this game seems overcooked. And worse, I did not have any sense of the story when playing.
With Aliens it is simpler I guess: I do not need to remember how the movie unfolds, all I need to know is that Aliens are bording my ship, and they crawl through various rooms.
In Firefly I have references to story elements I do not remember. Some ship, some guy. It does not grab my attention.

I need to give it a second try, maybe some different missions. Rating might go up.

Update: I played the first 3 missions again. I inteded to start it is a campaign, but by the time I had finished the first part (Mission 1a,1b,2) I got kind of bored with it. Why? Because there was absolutely no challenge here. Sure, I was lucky the Dortmunder arrived late in Mission 1a. Had it arrived early it might have been close to impossible. Such a poor design decision.
Rating went up to 5.5 though. I suspect it might be 6, or even 7, in multiplayer. There are so many card to help the other players, but it is just so boring a game to play solitaire.

Update: Dug it out to try again. Raised the rating with 0.5 point to 6. I am entertained for a bit at least. Having a lower expection helps.
Still, once again I only got through the first (of 5) scenarios before giving up on the campaign. Who wants to spend 8+ hours when there is no challenge?

I'm not a deck-build player normally, but this is the best of the LE series, and the preferred short game I'd play with Browncoats.  The constant changes between episodes, the ship upgrades, and the character flaws give this game more substance than other LEs.  The set up and tear down is a bit long, and the card artwork is mediocre.  However, this game has more mood than any other Firefly game except for the RPG (but the RPG genre is naturally set up for that).  I gave this a 6 and most other Firefly games I'd give a 4 to.  I gave the Alien LE a 5.5 for perspective.  Oh wait, forgot to add 2 for keeping Firefly alive.

All things considered, this is probably the worst Legendary base set in terms of the mechanics. I feel like the play testing for this game was almost nonexistent, as most of the scenarios are so difficult that you almost have to have a certain group of characters to even have a shot at winning. The Firefly fan in me likes this game quite a bit though, as I feel that it captures the show's theme better than the board game does. It may not let you explore that universe as well, but the folks at Upper Deck did a good job of transferring the feel of the show into a game. I just wish that the difficulty wasn't so ridiculous, because this puts Predator, which I thought was very difficult, to shame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Legendary refined and improved (except for the artwork).

Pros:
- Captures the theme so so well.
- Ship upgrades & strikes system changes the legendary game.
- Avatars, Flaws & Talent system is clever.
- Always play with the whole crew, very clever and thematic system where the non-player main characters still matter to the stor... sorry gameplay.
- Excellent as a solo game as well.
- Difficult

Cons: 
- Difficult... on the first game, if the first episode card is the Alliance ship, you are toast (happened in my first 2 games even though there was a 1/12 of that happening). 
- the artwork is abysmal. ABYSMAL.
- Setup time still a minor flaw in legendary.
- Can be lengthy solo, the game loves to make you die of a slow death....

Add me to the collection of people who ask, "What the ^%$# is going on with the art?"  I do a fair amount of retheming, and am kind of tempted to rework this one.  If it weren't for the fact that getting a decent set of cards to replace these would be/will be cost prohibitive, it wouldn't even be an issue -- I'd just do it.  Because the game IS good.  It deserves a better treatment from the art department.  I enjoy it and the universe it's set in.  I love the ability to assist other individuals on their turn -- I think that's been incorporated into some of the other Legendary Encounters games.  (I seem to recall it in Alien, but might be misremembering.)  If you like Firefly and you enjoy the Legendary series, I highly recommend it.

Next iteration of the Legendary system, based on the Firefly TV show (but with original art). Each of the 9 Serenity crew are represented by an Avatar and a crew deck. Each player chooses an avatar. Additional avatars are placed on the table to bring the total up to 5. The remaining 4 crew member decks are shuffled to form the deck you can recruit from. 

There appear to be several new mechanisms and other changes to the system.

2 Plays - Another great deck builder in the series of legendary (Alien/ Predator being good ones). I thought this had all the greatness of previous implementations of this series, with meaningful tweaks that made it different enough to be its own game. Given the number of great games out there these days, I probably wouldn't own this on top of Alien though. My nitpick for this game is that it seemed even more setup heavy and more fiddly (in-game) than Alien (which in my opinion is overall a little more 'elegant'). Close call, as I do enjoy the ship upgrades and other elements in this too.

I HIGHLY ADVISE READING ALL THE WAY UNTIL THE END OF THE RULEBOOK BEFORE YOUR FIRST PLAY AS THE BUHN DAHN WHO WROTE IT HID THE "BEGINNER" INSTRUCTIONS ON THE LAST PAGES. We got destroyed first time out, the game is VERY hard. We use the "beginner" instructions for all our games, also, since the game lets you pick a character but not let you use their cards, we used a variant that let each player have a mini-shop of two cards from their character's set that they could purchase instead of buying from the Bridge. The game was MUCH more enjoyable the second time around with these rules.

I love Firefly too much to want to look at that "art".

I'm reminded of a movie called "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus". Due to Heath Ledger dying before the fantasy scenes were shot, his character is played by three different actors while in the fantasy, and Ledger in the 'real' world. YMMV on how well that worked.

Much the same, here we have most of the cast looking like they're being played by at least four different actors, none of whom were on the show. And at least one of them is some sort of mutant hobgoblin.

I'd long seen the Legendary Encounters games. Something about them didn't really resonate with me, so I never bothered getting any of them. Christmas 2016 changed that. My girlfriend asked me "would you prefer a game that looks bad, but has great gameplay - or would you prefer one that looks good?". I replied that I don't care what a game looks like, gameplay matters much more. So Julia combined my love of Firefly and boardgames to get me this one and the game was on!

Component wise, the box is big and sturdy. Card stock is good and the rules are pretty well written. The game is fairly easy to figure out. 

As a deckbuilder, the game plays pretty well. I like the episodic format, Firefly fans will be able to follow along with a series - it all ties in well to what we know and love. I'm not the first person to note that the artwork REALLY SUCKS. Seriously, if you're going to pickup the license here - then do a similar job compared to the other  legendary games. Having said that, the game is pretty fun and engaging, with limited downtime between turns.

I've only played it 2 player. It's not an easy game to win, but we managed to snatch a victory from the literal jaws of defeat. That good feeling probably feeds into my scoring.

Overall, I like the game enough that it'll always be in my collection and I'd have no problem suggesting having a game. However, the horrible artwork really does remove from my enjoyment here. If I didn't know Firefly, I probably wouldn't care as much. But I do know it and I do love it - and I can't help but think that the artwork stops this from being a real favorite game of mine.....

RATING: 6
The theme is pretty well done -- I like the introduction of flaws and ship damage to enrich the legendary mechanics, and the fact that all the episodes and main characters are represented.  I really like how the flaws are often worse than the talents, making the crew feel dysfunctional and thrown together.

Like other Legendary games, the game can feel a bit rote -- every card that comes up on the board will eventually be bought (minus the 5 there at the end of the game), so you don't feel like there is really much control over your deck construction -- just distribution between players.  A house rule to allow discarding cards from the available set would improve the game immensely.

Some complain about the art -- I understand their issues, but it doesn't bother me.  I still find it thematically strong, even though the characters do not resemble the actors.

The game balance is pretty good -- a tad easy, but still offering tension towards the end.  I really like how the game 'resets' between the 3 episodes, so you get a sense of scrambling to complete the mission and get out, rather than methodically eliminating every single threat that comes out.  In other games, you had to dominate to win.  Here, you can race in, do it, and get out and still do very well.  That is both thematic and strategically interesting.

I adore Firefly and I'm so glad to finally be able to say they have a game that's worthy of the franchise. The game-play was engaging with little/no downtime between turns. We played a 5 player game and won by the skin of our teeth. 
Pros:
- Little/no player downtime
- Fantastic theme that WORKS (the flaw/talent system is challenging, but fun and thematically engrossing)
- Fun deck builder that can be merged with the other Legendary series
- Constant player interaction due to coop mechanic

This game is both an outstanding revision to the existing Legendary card mechanics while at the same time creating a worthy adaptation of Firefly to a card game setup. While GaleForceNine's board game is epitomizes Firefly game play, Legendary Encounters captures a nice Firefly flavor, and with a little conceptualizing a few mechanics, you get as fun an experience with a third of the game length and a tenth of the setup effort. 
I'm already a big fan of Marvel Legendary, but I'm an even bigger fan of the game-balancing mechanic shifts in this rules set. The starting hand ratio has shifted from 8/4 to 7/5/1 for a better variety and balance in your opening turns. The "preparatory" round(s) with a high number of players is a crucial update, allowing players to spend a round or two not fighting and getting a chance to buy a few cards before facing danger. The three-tiered episode system is brilliant as well. Replacing the villain deck, which was haphazard and unpredictable, sometimes yielding multiple Twists or oversized villains too early in the game to be playable, an Encounters game is made up of three episode decks of your choice as long as you play then in order of their rating, one A, one B, and one C episode per game. This ensures the game escalates at a playable rate, not overwhelming players early, and allowing the game to be suitably challenging at the end. Finally, the game is fully cooperative (rather than semi-), which fits better with the 'Verse, and new mechanics that let you play cards to help others on their turn means you are always engaged in what is happening instead of taking your turn and then waiting for others to finish before you get to play again. 
From a Firefly perspective, the cards work well to capture flavor of each character. The game is set up to choose five "main characters" from the nine crew (even with fewer than five players), whose avatars players will use during the game, and the remaining four characters' decks make up the Support Deck, so all nine crew members are involved in every game, maintaining that Firefly crew feel. The cards are flavored nicely from quotes from the show, with mechanics that still work well in the game. I was surprised to see art on the cards instead of shots from the show, but I imagine that will give them more flexibility if they want to expand into original stories for additional episode expansions, or use stories from the comics, etc. 
Overall, I found this to be an amazing game, and I can't imagine every getting bored with it. The cards and playmat are high quality and game play is fun and repeatable, especially if you are a Firefly fan. I brought this to try out at our weekly game night, and it ended up being the only thing we played that night because we just wanted to keep playing through all the episodes.

I really enjoy the Legendary System, Alien being my favorite.  My initial thoughts were not to purchase the game because of the poor art, but I succumbed. I'm glad i did.  The art, although not that great doesn't bother me and the gameplay, like Alien, is downright fun.  I love the new mechanics of talents, flaws and side jobs and the theme shines through strongly.  I gotta say, despite the less than stellar art, this is excellent.

Captures the feel of Firefly very well. However, the artwork is HORRIBLE (one of the worst I've ever seen... you can't even tell who some of the main characters are). And the biggest problem is the sheer variance of difficult based on the order of cards coming up and who you have or don't have in your party. Some missions can be super easy or incredibly hard just based on the order of the cards and who you have. Finally, I wish there were more ways to cull ("Defeat") cards in your deck to improve over the episodes. It feels like a lot of hands are either super useless or super amazing due to almost never being able to remove the starting cards.

I purchased the game as a Christmas present for my daughter. We entered February and had still not played the game due to study commitments. I borrowed the game Wednesday February 1st to learn the rules, which I did so the following day (with the assistance of a YouTube play through). I purchased the game the following day for myself and cannot believe it has only been one week since learning it. I have read multiple comments, many about the artwork (which initially was a concern for me too), BUT after learning the art is similar the Firefly graphic novels it has no longer bothered me and really - it does not detract from the gameplay experience.

RATING: 9
The only game from Legendary Encounters series which appeals to me. I enjoy the way how well Episodes cards reference the TV series, different goals and ways to achieve them, fresh ideas with talents and flaws, side jobs, ship upgrades and damage. 
As a negative side, random order of some Episode cards can make the game easy to lose and artwork is quite mediocre. This game merits better art.

I'm not a big Marvel Legendary fan, it's such a slow burn that you don't do anything for a long time. This game feels like Firefly as you play through the episodes and is a ton of fun. I'd highly recommend the game, but I'm not sure it's a game that I'll buy, I'll just play my friends copy.

RATING: 8
I was really excited to play this game, as cooperative games are my favorite kind, Firefly is my thing and this title comes from a family of games with positive buzz regarding its quality. I'm pleased to say it lived up to its predecessors. [thing=195571][/thing] is a good game, with some neat mechanics - the way the enemies and events run by the locations hidden is neat and tense, as we can see the threats advancing, without knowing what they are, unless we scan the place, which can, in turn, lead to even more nastiness. The game play is mostly the same as in Legendary - deckbuilding with two "currencies" - attack (to defeat enemies and ships) and influence (to acquire new cards). Cards to purchase come all from the same deck - built by 4 of the heroes decks (which will be the "support" for the play; the other heroes will be the main ones) - , and a new card is revealed after one in the track is taken. 

[thing=195571][/thing] is based in scenarios, following the episodes in the series - in the first scenario, Serenity Part 1, for instance, the final goal is to find some salvage parts; for the second, Serenity Part 2, the goal is to defeat Patience and Dobson; as for the third scenario (which closes the first chapter), The Train Job, the goal is to defeat Crow and steal medical supplies. Everything connected with the episodes and highly thematic. Even more than [thing=146652][/thing], [thing=195571]Legendary: Firefly[/thing] goes deeper into the theme, with many cards in the scenarios relating to a particular character, and its presence (or absence) can help or harm - very fun.

Once the enemies reach the combat zone, they will start to attack the players, making them, on their turns, to draw from the strike deck, which will, most of the time, cause injury to the characters - if the damage reaches the total HP of characters, he/she will be killed, and out of the play for the moment, but can be brought back to play, if she or he recover health, helped by someone - if all players are down with no one left to help, the players lose. But the enemy can also be ships, and these will attack Serenity itself, causing damage, which will make the life of the crew harder; and if Serenity suffers too many hits, it will be destroyed and the play will end in defeat. Finally, the game ends in defeat if a mandatory objective isn't fulfilled; however, other objectives can be left unmet - it will just lower the final scoring of the play. Players will win only if they can avoid the ill fates above and fulfill the final objective of the last scenario.

The decisions aren't all that hard to be made - is mostly which card to buy (usually vying for combos, using cards of the same icon, like in regular Legendary), which enemy to attack and/or where to scan. Scan is done blindly - there is no way to know what will appear (and, well, how could be otherwise, right?). Which enemy to attack is often given, either because there will be only one, or because if you have a lot of attack, you will normally attack the enemy that is tougher to beat, or one that is causing the most problems or one that is also an objective - this is only slightly changed when there is a ship attacking Serenity, as these don't immediately harm the players, and Serenity can be patched easier than recovering health. Furthermore, with the inclusion of Serenity and in between scenarios (episodes) steps, in which players can spend Credits earned during play to heal or buy upgrades do Serenity, add a little more choices.

There is plenty of luck of the draw: in the players deck, in the draw deck and in the enemy deck - in this last one the goal cards are shuffled, and while there is no way of knowing where they are, the decks are small - 10 to 12 cards, normally. The luck of the draw can be a little reduced by the addition of Coordinate cards - these can be played by other players during someone else's turn in order give boosts in attack or influence - this, besides talking about the the best way to proceed (which place to scan, who to heal, and so on), is the cooperation in the game.

As one could expect, deck builders aren't really the best mechanic to create a cooperative game, as the very nature of a person building her own deck is mostly a solitaire business. The Coordinate card is mainly all the interaction allowed by the game. One player can't, say, put his character in front of other to protect it from damage, nor they can share resources, or split to cover more ground (ok, this part is good that can't happen). Still, the Coordinate is key to win and, considering several cards have this key-word (including the Browncoats cards, that are a basic card, always present), Coordinate can happen often, so there is definitely a sense of cooperation between players, even if not as much as some other games.

The cards are a little on the flimsy side, but the game mat is awesome - is made of rubbery material, and it feels great (and it doesn't have "memory" - i.e.: it doesn't curve the tips). The artwork is serviceable, with some great and other subpar.

The worst part of [thing=146652][/thing] is the player elimination, a mechanic that, while thematic (and is necessary to properly give a sense of dread), can lead to someone leaving early (as there are some high damage cards in the strike deck, dealing 4, even 5 damage at once) and just watching the game go on.  [thing=195571]Legendary: Firefly[/thing] don't took away the fear of dying, but the player elimination was softened, as another person can use cards that heal in order to bring the hero back to the fight.

[thing=195571]Legendary: Firefly[/thing] has a simple campaign mode, in which players use the scenarios in a specific order and while the decks don't remain built, upgrades and damage on Serenity are kept.

Overall, [thing=195571][/thing] is a good cooperative game, dynamic and tense, that doesn't go "easy" on players, even in the first scenario. The rules and flow are easy to understand, specially if the players already know [thing=129437][/thing] or [thing=146652][/thing]. There is truly a feel of the series in the game - the side jobs, the enemies, the problems with the persons and places, all the while people keep trying to take the sky from you. Make sure you don't let them, even if this require some misbehaving.

A fun deckbuilding romp through the Firefly 'verse... Scenarios allow you to relive each of the Firefly Episodes.  Highly thematic.  My favorite of the Legendary systems. Not sure I need to own it, but Otherwise fun.  However, Card art is pretty poor and could use a more robust culling mechanism.

The artwork is inconsistent and very painful to some firefly fans who love aesthetics in their games.  The board map, box, and most character identity cards look wonderful.  The character action cards, strikes, encounter cards, and such... look unpolished and cartoonish.  I love the gameplay and can live with poor artwork.

OK, the rules could use work. If Firefly had been my very first Legendary game, I would have been baffled and woozy.  And if I'd never played a deckbuilding game at all, I wouldn't have gotten past the first five pages without having a seizure.  Minimally, why not include an example of a full turn?  You know, for the kids?

As a bonus, some rules are simply missing (e.g., a ship strike overlapping a ship upgrade).  And a game with this much card text needs to strive for maximum clarity, which isn't always the case.

On the gameplay side, one issue is that the random order of the early Episode cards can cause the game to flop hard.  (Legendary:Aliens has the same problem with early facehuggers.)  We lost our first game in 10 minutes due to unavoidable ship strikes that caused the melancholy destruction of the Serenity.  We persevered and tried again, but others might have grown frustrated and hypertossed Firefly into the trade pile.  Or the 'Pile, if you're hip to the lingo.

The new twists on the Legendary system are inventive, though: differentiated crew/ship strikes, flaws (wound variants that feel fresh), wacky side jobs, episode intermissions with a purchasing/upgrade phase, and character powers tied to generic Talent cards.  The latter means that it's possible for multiple copies of a character's power (i.e., multiple Talent cards) to be in his/her deck.  Clever.

Plus the designers clearly dig the series.  You can play every single episode of the show, which is cool if you're a fan.  And if you're a blind fan, doubly cool.  Because the card art isn't art in the traditional sense.  More like abstract dream imagery inhabited by sock puppets.  And the top-down illustration on page 5 of the rulebook? Wow. The only natural thing about that image is my aversion to retinal torture.

[i]Update:[/i]

This is my lowest rated Legendary game.  I'll still play occasionally, but my enthusiasm has dissipated - if it was ever pated in the first place.

The difficulty is screwy, and almost always on the high side. Scenarios are either too accelerated (not enough time to build a decent deck), too random (certain cards come out early = loss), or too schizophrenic (requiring high money AND high attack, which is difficult to achieve).  We'll be exploring the official "easy" variants: increased health, 1-2 free buy rounds, etc.

And the suggested major characters for each scenario are NOT GOOD.  Quite the opposite, in fact.

Solid engine, loved LE: Alien and Firefly has always been in my top 10 shows (easy to squeeze in once a year at only 14 ep).

But this art is truly unacceptable. I thought the avatars were actually pretty good overall, but so many of the other cards just look like prototypes, and even that feels a little too generous on some cards. For the exorbitant price this is nothing but a cash grab and I hope it fails miserably.

The Marvel version of this game is my favorite game of all time. The same cannot be said for this version. I am a massive fan of the TV show it is based on, but my fandom isn't strong enough to let me look past the game's laughable artwork. Additionally, all the streamlined mechanics from the Marvel version have been abandoned in favor of convoluted mechanics that poorly replicate events from the show. I will still play this game, but I'll be modifying it to be more like the Marvel version.

Yes, some of (actually most of) the art on the cards are quite bad, but it's a minor issue considering how good this game is mechanically and how well it captures the theme of the TV-series.
This game also introduces some solid new mechanics (Serenity as a 10th "character", ship upgrades and campaign mode to mention some) compared to the previous installments in the Legendary Encounters series.

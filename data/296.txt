Great game. Played three times in a row yesterday, last time was the best. A four player match ended with three of us within 46 and 49 victory points and each using a different strategy: closing cities, taking money and spreading through regions. Saving money won.

It's a great concept that plays just slightly awkwardly. The interest should come from competing over towns, but that's very difficult to do. Generally either it's taken before you get to it or the writing is pretty clearly on the wall within a round of two if you actually get multiple players in there. In the end, it ends up as an area control game that plays more like multiplayer solitaire.

Maybe if most of the cities had been 5s, they would have been big enough for many battles to go on, and then players would have to split their attention and it wouldn't be so clear who would win what. Unfortunately, that would require a components update, so not something that can be solved with a house rule.

The game is also a bit awkward with the turn steps. For the purpose of the games, they make sense, but there's something unintuitive about them that makes it easy to go in the wrong order, and you have to remind players to readjust their turn fairly often. I think that it's due to this that there a substantial increase in play speed between the start of the game and the end. Once people finally lock in on the order of events, moves are very fast and the game flies. But it really takes a long time to get to that point. It's not just one of two rounds for everyone to get comfortable. Instead is more like 3/4ths through.

I do think this has the basis for a great game. And maybe, played with the same group many times over, it would become a deep and cutthroat game, as everyone comes to understand exactly which paths are necessary and how to block those off, etc. But, minus that, and you're left with a game that feels 'incomplete' somehow. It just don't work quite right as it is.

It could have been the group of players, it could have just been a mood, but this one just didn't sit well.  The rules felt clumsy and the area control mechanism was very frustrating.  Out of the six players playing none enjoyed the game.

RATING: 6
Although Medieval Merchant's theme is the expansion of trading houses, it most closely resembles games about the building of transport networks.  Early turns can feel fairly scripted:  set-up close to the highest scoring city you can open, open it, place branch, take income until another player threatens your majority.  The game opens up later as the control of cities is contested and trading networks are extended across the board in a desperate race for the last of the victory points.  The random deal of city opening tiles and decisions on their placement bring a degree of variability from game to game.   What bothers me somewhat is that in terms of value and routes to other towns, cities and regions, Koln and Erfurt are definitively the best starting cities.  For balance the game relies on other players to make them less so.

While the artwork is quite pleasant, the twisted mass of routes is much harder on the eye than, say, Ticket to Ride's.  Production quality is good, except for the flimsy paper money.

I had my eye on this for a long time.  Widely positive comments, supposed to be a rare best-with-6P game.  I eventually acquired it, and eventually played it.  The actual rules are only about 6 spaced pages, but we wrestled a bit with terminology like adding versus opening branches, cities versus towns, etc.  It's really a simple game, and we all found it to be surprisingly devoid of interesting decisions and impacted by random city marker and player order distribution.  I think this one is holding up because of old ratings, and wouldn't stand much of a chance with any theme compared to more modern games.

Power Grid light.  Beautiful board.  Really plays best with 6 because you need everyone else in there jostling.  Otherwise it becomes too easy for one person to grab a slice of the pie for themselves and run away.

This game was really interesting. I started in an expensive area of the board and didn't secure much income for myself. By the time I realized what I should have done, it was too late. Next time I'll play it differently. It was a 6-player game, so the board was very tight. I'm interested in seeing what it's like with fewer players.

Just an okay game.  Too complex to serve as a gateway game.  Fine for gamers.  Basic/balanced setup isn't very good since the "short" routes through the towns see almost no use... so play using the advanced rules where everyone gets a few city discs and must play one per turn to the board.  The money is ugly.  The graphics on the board are very busy.  The 3 space cities are very valuable (easy to take total control).  Seems to have some balance issues if playing with less than 6 players... you need to watch who is doing well and try to chip away at their advantages.  Also, beware of rushing an area.  If too many people go to one portion of the board, you will end up wasting time and resources trying to get into the area (go somewhere else instead).

With 2nd Edition rules modification from Riogrande 2002. Empty cities cost now some guilders for building up branches here. Avoid, IMO 2 and 6 player games! 
I managed to unite Medieval merchant with K.J.Wrede´s Die Fugger card-game as a small MOD-Addon. This now supports 5 good-cards (a deck of 60 cards)and a small demand market and increase your revenue and get some bonifications when you raise your guild status. I tried to keep the base game characteristics as much as possible an playing time should stay the same of dual-simultan turns between the players. Additionally a Guild-level system is the cream of MM. Over 14 years after his release this is again a hot shot.

Medieval Merchant was my only new game of my 5-day retreat and my second favorite new-to-me of April. It's what Power Grid would be if you stripped away all the yuck. It's a network building game where you get the majority of your victory points from having the absolute majority in cities. Each round, you have the choice for each city where you have influence of either increasing your influence or getting paid the current monetary value of the city (which goes down over time). You then use the money to pay the connection costs to extend your network. Very interactive as it's all about figuring out what other people are going to do in cities you're both in on their turn. Easy to teach and fairly short (I think it took us 2 hours but I'd expect it to drop to 60 - 90 with another play or two) which is great since good 6 player games are few and far between. Absolutely recommend trying if you've got 5 or 6 people (not sure if it'd be too open with less).

The sweet spot lies between 5 and 6 players, probably slightly closer to 5.  Never play with less as there just aren't enough elbows.

Timing of opportunity is everything.

The complaints about the rote end-game are valid except for the fact that the very end of the game, once it reaches that point, is very rapid and entirely predictable.  A minute or so later and the game is done.  Thus the actual end-game occurs a bit earlier and happens to be quite marvelous.  Pay attention.

I like the decisions you have to make here. Initial board position may be a bit too important, and I'm not sure whether there is a turn order advantage, but it feels like maybe there is. 

Biggest negative is that the board can get pretty busy and hard to look at, although the crucial information isn't all that hard to parse.

My favorites aspect of it is the double action contracts. Those make the game, in my opinion. It allows other players to have the potential to foil your plans. It allows you to sneak in and get that position you desperately needed/wanted.

Its also important that there are multiple game end conditions. 

It all works well enough, but the them is pretty thin when it comes down to it. I think maybe Power Grid does what this game does, but better and with more meat.

Good, solid euro style game, which unfortunately doesn't get voted up anymore with my extended gaming group.  The game is a game of outmanuevering your opponents for valuable trade routes.

Medieval Merchant is a very nice, if somewhat dry, perfect information economic game. The key tension - timing when to switch from leeching income from cities to locking them down for victory points - is both clever and provides a satisfying decision density throughout. But this only works well with five or six; the game really benefits from a more constrained play space, and more players also shortens the less interesting income-only first phase. The game does beg for a graphic redesign, though, as the bland color palette is both unappealing and makes differentiating regions much more difficult than it needs to be.

There was a time that we played this game once a week for months at a stretch.  It's a solid game, with the constant angst of having too much to do and only a few actions to accomplish 'em.  The static board was designed well, but with all the playings we gave it, I prefer it with four players only.  Three's too much space, and five's not enough.  I would LOVE to have a new board for this game someday...  Magna Grecia really kinda reminds me of this game, only on a variable board...

A wonderful, yet strangely underrated, game by Goldsieber. Players gradually open up areas of the board and build networks of trading houses in towns and cities. At each city you can either increase your trade holdings or draw income (vital for future expansion). It&#039;s all about victory points in the end, which are earned for controlling cities, building in villages, being spread across the board and holding lots of cash. Very much a &quot;want to do lots, but can only do a little&quot; game. One of my favorties.

An overlooked game, and a great one too. I feel that the complexity and the feel of this are on par with the El Grande. But Medieval Merchant has easier decisions and smoother play than El Grande. Yet MM doesn't leave me aching to play again right away. Another great game from Goldseiber, whose track record for big-box games is unparalleled.

RATING: 4
Very disappointed. The title and box art intrigued me, but then when I saw the board all I saw was a dumbed down medieval Power Grid. I was out of the game before I had even made my first move. Playing last with 5 players, there were no unclaimed areas on the board that were aligned with the cities I was drawn. Game shouldn't be played with more than 4, and even then it's doubtful that it is worth it.

Purchase at the 2006 WBC.

Played once a long time ago. Played it recently. I enjoyed the game. It is a fairly easy game to learn since you do the same actions each turn.

Somewhat like Power Grid, but without auctions and resources. I wonder about it's replay value, but's it's enjoyable.

What do you do in your turn? You place a city on the board and than do you get some money or place control markers in a city? More controls in a city, the less money it can give you. You need a good balance of both.

Plays surprisingly well with 6, and is reasonably quick too. An interesting game where you need a sense of timing to do well - do you take income or close off cities for points? Plenty of tactical decisions, in part because of the cunningly asymmetric board. I've also played with fewer and it works fine too, but is less crowded and perhaps less tense.

A dry and somewhat boring game, very computational.  Nothing really gripping here -- fails to evoke its theme.  Drab colors lack visual appeal.  With fewer players, tends toward abstract strategy; becomes more difficult to plan as number of players increases.

Excessively puzzly, overstepping it's reasonable boundaries in that regard.  We played the beginner's version, which I suspect was a extremely big mistake, and so this rating is pretty unfair.  Should revisit.  I quite like the look of the map.

This game works better on paper than in practice. On paper, (excuse the cliché) Power Grid on steroids. In practice, too narrow and unforgiving. Decisions aren't as interesting as you think they'd be but rather driven by circumstances each turn. And if you don't manage your income correctly, you can be effectively out of the game early on. The calculations cause more downtime than Power Grid, and I concur on the criticism of the player colors. Light brown and dark brown? Really? Really, I should just play more Power Grid.

A good game so far; didn't quite make the 9 because I share the fears of those that say the opening play can have an effect on the entire game.  While I don't believe good initial placement gives certain victory, I do believe it helps a great deal; and some towns are definitely better than others in this respect.

Update 16OCT03:  This game is staying at an 8, but I now believe that initial placement has less influence on victory in the game than previously envisaged.  There is definitely more than one way to skin this cat, and the winner of last night's game achieved victory through taking income as often as possible (which bolstered his lack of influence throughout the game).

UPDATE 20DEC06:  I have generally adjusted many ratings; this hasn't been out for a while so has dropped to a 7.

Medieval Merchants has simple rules (even if the rulebook makes it seem complicated and arcane at times) yet engaging gameplay. Players constantly need to decide between the need for more income that is required for further expansion of the trade network and building majorities which reduces money-making opportunities but can contribute significantly to your final score.

The game has aged very well with little excess baggage, and plays quickly even with the full complement of players.

A good game. The heart of the game is choosing turn after turn for each city if you want to take the money or add a control marker for securing the majority in that city. The money is not direct victory points but is essential to expand your network of cities. Remind me a bit PowerGrid, but much simpler. On the down side, the board is very confusing.

Excellent network building game.  The uninspiring English title and ultra-Euro box art are not going to help convince new players to try it, but if you like connections, this is a fun one!  The decisions of when to convert cashflow to securing points are fantastic.  It's a bit akin to a lighter Power Grid without the auctions and resources, but with greater need to spread out and intermingle without getting blocked in.

Opinion: good classic game of building your network. A game from 1998 that could stand for today. The rules are clean, with nothing superfluous inside and leaving a gameplay clean and with many interaction between players. You have to build your network of offices in the map, but you have to take into account the routes to follow between towns and cities, take a look at majorities in the cities and which cities are in play (all are going to be in play, but the timing players decide this is part of the game).
This is not a game I will prepare a session to play, but could be one I play in any session. The gameplay has lot of tension with the offices built

Played 2+ 5 Players. When I sat through the rule explanation for this game I thought "What are we playing!". It feels like you are about to take the Mensa entry exam rather than play a game for pleasure. Initial impressions aside, this is an enjoyable game that I would jump to play again. Mar 04

Very dry, very mathematical, with an anti-climactic ending.  Its like someone borrowed the flaws from powergrid and built an area majority game out of it.  There is a lot of downtime and not that many decisions to make on your turn.  Your strategy seems sort of driven by the circumstances, although it seems like you get to choose between the super-income strategy and the make just enough to get by strategy. The game is functional and fun at times, but I can't say I want to play it again.

I waited about 10 years to play this a second time.  Yes, I must have gotten a bad impression the first time around, but I think I'm past that now. :)  I think that the key is to spread out among regions as fast as possible, so stay out of the top-right and focus on the small regions in the south.  A single house in a region is worth 3 points -- 1 for the house, 2 for being in a new region.  Spend most of your money every turn -- run a lean campaign.  (I tried to save up money and spend it at the end, but I had much less time and space at the end than I thought I would.)  Perhaps, try to win the odd-sized cities (you need only 2 houses to win a 3-city, but 3 houses to win a 4-city).  And despite the bonuses at the end (2 VPs/region   1 VP/$20), the score along the way is extremely meaningful.  Try to win cities and steal points from the leaders!

I hear that the game is only good with 5 or 6 (not fewer) players, but I don't have any evidence.

Medieval Merchant, on a first play, seems a very under-rated game in many respects.

It has much of the map and connection domination aspects of Power Grid (6-years prior), ans also offers a lot of elegant, but nasty choices between locking in VP with cities or taking the income (which only seems to dwindle as the game progresses).

I loved the area control, and endgame points for regional offices- both seem to actually bring out the theme in what otherwise can be a slightly themeless Euro (but truly, less so than Hansa Teutonica seemed to me).

I'd love to get a really big game of this with friends, and get down to some pushing and shoving- it seems like it would be terrific at max counts.

My only reservation was the semi-random distribution of cities. In the 4-player solo learning game I played it seemed like (a) the players with the best cities had a huge financial advantage, which translated into end-game points, (b) despite the effort made to distribute a fair number of high point cities there was no guarantee given that it wouldn't fall out badly again.  It might be interesting to build out set starting hands of high-point city tiles like the initial sun distribution in Ra, to avoid that, especially in lower player-count games.

I suspect that it wouldn't be as much of an issue with 5-6 players; the lack of space would guarantee no one ha droom to turtle, or suck up too much uninterrupted income.

I think I have to start this one at a 7.5, despite my misgivings withe initial draw of cities.  This game has a lot going for it- I definitely like it even better than Vino, and I think it probably deserves more recognition on the site.

PS: I actually also have a new copy on pre-order, but discovering that the new RGG reprint would be 
'Starbucks' themed, I got impatient to try the original flavour first, before the coffee-flavoured version comes out.

The income calculation nearly requires a calculator and the board is a bit graphically overwhelming.

After the initial placement it felt like the first couple of turns were fairly rote as everyone was quite spread out. After that it settled into a decent enough Power Grid-lite connection game.

But at the end of the day I'd rather just play Power Grid.

An interesting connection-building economic game with a board that quickly crowds up, but is still open for swift, surprising, and well-timed actions. It's a little reminiscent of Power Grid, but it plays faster and there are fewer elements involved. Each city has a variable amount of spaces for players to open branches (I believe the players are competing bankers). On a player's turn, for each city where that player's branch exists, he can either collect income or add another branch. Income from a city is determined by the number of empty spaces on a city, so the less branches, the higher the income. But points come from having a majority of branches in the city, so if you collect income, you risk having other players swoop in and grab the points. You can also expand to one new city or town on your turn by paying the connection cost, so everyone pretty much expands at the same rate. It is cheap to connect to towns, but they don't give you income and they only provide one point, and while cheap, they also slow your expansion rate to the income and point-producing cities. Each player also has two "letters of escort" which allows them to double the effectiveness of one of their actions for the turn, so using those letters at just the right time is also key. I thought this game had interesting decisions in every phase. The game board is broken into regions like in Power Grid and you get points at the end for each region you have a presence in. 

The game is good, but what makes it a rare treat is that it is a solid economic euro that plays GREAT with 6 players. How many euros can you say that about? If you play with 6 even occasionally, this is a great game to have on the shelf!

Update: I've decided to move this on. There are more options at 6  players these days and I feel this game loses a lot at lower player counts. Dropped my rating a point to reflect this.

As I've had a chance to play it twice in a row recently, I'm coming increasingly to respect the scope in this game for strategy and (if you play it this way) diplomacy.

This is a connection game in which your are expanding into cities - but at a cost depending on the connections that work for you.  Entry into cities grants income each turn - which diminishes as more players enter, or as the fight for control heats up.

The outstanding feature is Pfeffersäcke's playability with six players. Each turn is short consisting of either taking money or developing branch offices followed by the extension of trade routes. Once an absolute majority in a city is reached or at least the relative majority is settled, the city is scored.

It's interesting enough for a play or two, it works but Pfeffersäcke doesn't grab me. The decisions are bland. Starting positions are too important. The starting setup can decide the game against players if they get stuck between others as it's most important to be first in cities and have one or two uncontested cities. The starting player has an advantage if not mediated by other players giving him a harder time than players later in the player order.

RATING: 5
I don't get it.  A combination between an area majority game and a route-bulding game in which neither the area majority competition nor the route-building is particularly interesting.

Why is the scoring so convoluted?  ("Towns pay income equal to the number of blank slots in the town multiplied by the number of players, minus one.")  Why do the routes have such bizarre costs?  (39, 17, 28, 5, etc.)

The game tension is too low, and the central conflict too dry, for me to believe I'll ever play it again.

The game is an interesting challenge in graph theory and the scoring is clever. However, the money is really annoying - it would have been better to use poker chips or bring a roll of pennies.

Of all the brown games I've played, this is the brownest. Brown box, brown board, brown bits. Probably the biggest gap between expectation and experience that I've ever played. Looking at it, I expected a 3 - but it's easily an 8. Holy crap, what a great game. I'm guessing I'd never heard of it mainly because it looked so unappealing that it must be that others felt the same and this slipped under the radar. There is a seriously good game in here - I love the way the town rondels work, the limitations on access, the fight for control and cash - let down by boring theme, art and presentation.

RATING: 9.3
The gameplay is simple, the randomness is minimal, and the strategy is high. Essentially, the player attempts to expand their influence across the board by gaining influence points. Influence points are won by controlling cities, claiming towns, occupying regions, or accumulating money. The person with the most influence points wins. A turn consists of - 1) Placing a city marker on the board [for anyone to branch into], 2) Collecting money for branches OR Opening a new branch in cities the player is already in, 3) Paying money to branch into a new city [to control it and/or collect money from it] OR Buying a town [to gain an influence point and have cheap access to other cities]. Thinking a few turns ahead for all players is a must. I thought, "where do I want to be a turn from now" and "where is everyone else going to be on their next turn."  Two players are honestly too few - there isn't enough interaction between players.  Three or four players take longer, but there's more interaction amongst the players (making for a better game).

Elegant, flawless design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A competitive area-control game where your you start your turn-off by looking at each city you're in and either adding influence to it or producing income.  There's a true trade-off between money and influence as cities produce less money per influence within it.  After that you can expand to a new city (or town).  You need to pay the connection cost to do so (and they can be expensive).  When expanding there a few things to consider such as opening up a new part of the board for one's self, adding influence into a new region (which score at end of game) or encroaching on an opponents's city just to reduce their income or perhaps in hopes to take it over eventually.  Plays great with 4 and is very poor with 3 (as the static board was too open).

Expanding your network by paying connection costs and adding little wooden houses sure reminds me of Power Grid.  While expansion is just one of many interesting activities present in Power Grid, claiming cities is the primary focus here.  Not nearly as many things to worry about here, but it is satisfying nonetheless. It plays reasonably quick so makes a nice alternative if players aren't up for a meatier (and longer) game such as Power Grid.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Medieval Merchant is like what Power Grid would be if the game actually focused on the interesting decision of cash flow management rather than on turn-order maneuvering. It's a game of keeping one step ahead of everyone else in the race for leverage.

Like Vino, the designer's other "big" design, the game is about choosing between long-term and short-term benefits. But, it's not the boring "pivot point" style of cash-engines turning into VP-engines that characterize so many economic development games.

Unlike games in which you can ignore your VP engine until your cash engine is churning, your VP engine is your cash engine in this game. It's a question of where you're going to drive the car, but choosing one direction gets you further from the other.

Players are bankers, and on their turn are founding a bank, expanding a bank, or travelling to other banks. VPs are awarded to who has the majority of  tokens on a bank and have tokens on houses. The board is made up of circles (for the values of the banks) and lines joining them represent the cost to get to them. Game is randomized by dealing out the circle (which have the values of the banks). Since the values of large banks range from 5 to 8, some people will have an advantage of which bank they are dealt. A couple of neat mechanics, where one has to decide to expand or collect money. Strategy wise, if another player crams you in, you could be restricted on what you do, and it seems how one's fortunes depends on the initial placement, the banks that are dealt out, and if neighbors decide to crowd into you. One positive thing about this game is that it does support 6 players.

RATING: 7
I didn't totally understand what I was trying to accomplish until halfway through my first play. Now that I get it (sort of) I'd like to play again. That's always a good sign and usually means the score will rise. **A second playing has moved this to a 7. I won this game, but I'm not sure I did anything that clever. This is something of a bad sign. It's still fun but more plays are needed to see whether it makes it to an 8 or settles back to a 6. I must also qualify the above by letting you know I have only played this with the full 6 players, which may account for the feeling of there being limited control and options available. **UPDATE 6/4/04** A couple more 6-player games have cemented this as a solid 7 rating. I enjoy the gameplay enough to dismiss any problems with this many players. I do look forward to a less crowded game to see how things differ.

absolutely loved the possibilities, and all of the mayhem that can be caused durring the game

i love that there is little randomness and that there are many different ways to score points... i think that it may take a bit for new players to not get whooped up on by experienced players... but fortunately i played this game with other noobs...

every part of this game requires some thought, and it seems that most games are scored very closely

also this is a GREAT 6 person game... however... they need to be gamers... it doesn't take very long either (1-2hrs)

The constant dilemma of moving optimally for yourself vs the value to yourself of sacrificing a move to shutting down someone’s cash cow provides angst. It also tends to lend equal importance to all turns throughout the game, from setup on, accentuated by the decisions each and every turn on whether to take the cash or secure a city against invaders. Good stuff. Downside is that the fixed board can get a bit samey from game to game.

A lovely game that requires players to judge when the time is right to abandon income collection and strike out for control of cities.  Plays quick - perhaps slightly too quick for what it is.  I am surprised more people don't rate this more highly.

RATING: 5
Nothing too devastatingly good here, though it's a fine connection game with some interesting decisions to make.  Still, most decisions, after first placement (which is somewhat luck-based) are fairly straightforward, and defending against certain moves seems easy.

That said, I've only played this 3 player, and I can imagine it gets better with more players, probably peaking at 5 or 6, as more of the board is contested and the high numbered spots not so easily acquired and defended.  I might play it again, and if someone was eager to, I'd give it a shot, but probably not with less than 5.

Also, the board is difficult to read and calculating income is a tremendous pain.

Like the trade off between getting money - needed for expansion and locking in your victory (aka influence) points.
Very strategic - need to look ahead to see where you want to be so you can expand later. Also a bit of brinksmanship where you make your plays to force others to forgo money.
Looks to play better with more players - 5 or 6 you need the competition for the spaces on the board

This game is enjoyable to play with many choices and challenges. Points are awarded by being the merchant with the most pieces in a city.  Cities with an equal number of merchants the points are halved and given to the first merchant in the city.  1 point is awarded for putting a merchant in a minor city.  At the end 2 points are awarded for having a merchant in each region.

Unsure why I like this game so much. The theme is totally misleading. It's a plane game set in medieval Germany! Too much calculation involved in working out income - we kept adding it up wrong. Need a professional auditor. The initial set up can advantage a player who manages to capture their own corner of the board early on the control marker distribution seems broken. I guess I just like influence and territory grabbing games a lot.

My wife hates this game and rates it below Carcassone (our whipping post game), but I like the balance of build or income that players need to walk as well as the area control.  I sense this would be a ton of fun with more players.

I was able to play a four player game and it was great!  I am raising my rating of this game up from a six.  It gets much much better with more elbows around the table that is for certain.  I would love to try it with five.

One thing seems to be true concerning play of this one is the end is a little anti-climatic and why my rating isn't a nine or ten.  Near the end of the game it appears that everyone should know who is going to win.  The middle portion of the game is quite competitive though and while I prefer tight endings, this doesn't break the game for me in Medieval Merchant.

This game is a PURE GAME. Not a lot of bells whistles or chrome, but it sure delivers! I have always admired the "LESS IS MORE" approach to game design, and its what I admire in games like MM, MEDICI, DVONN etc. There aren't a lot of components in this game, but you are always in a struggle of wanting to do 4 or 5 things and having to choose your BEST play. Fantastic game! Same designer of VINO (another great game). It is especially rich in brinksmanship (putting off an action as long as you can, to derive max value before it goes bad, like playing "chicken"). I was thrilled to pick up a used copy of this one!

Okay, my rating has gone up on this one. For being too long, I was wrong. The game plays just fine with any amount of players. I had missed a rule, and that caused the lower rating.
This game's only flaw might be the use of color (lack of). A game of managing money through buying branches in your banking network and traveling to new places to set up a new bank branch. Another winner by this author. Vino, the other.

A networking game that is pleasing despite a several moderate flaws.

Issues:
 - high luck based on initial deal of city tiles
 - low interaction unless playing with high player count
 - huge down time with high player count0
 - snowballing
 - kingmaking
 - lots of tiny irritating math calculations

That said:
 - there are interesting tradeoffs between efficiency and tempo (towns take an extra turn but are much cheaper)
 - there are interesting questions about when and how to use your 2 letters
 - the snowballing and luck are well masked until you get to know the game

All in all, this was a solid 7/10 that didn't age well as the genre matured.  Its minor problems are less forgivable now than they were in 1998.

I wish the game could be rethemed into the railroad game it obviously is and have the map cleaned up and decluttered to require less experience with the game to see, at a glance, the relationship of places on the map (my old map paradigm pet peeve again).  Still, a really strong game from a great designer.

Another comment for a game gone missing. What I said before still applies; nice simplified Powergrid without the auctions.

Played once, and I'm not sure the rules were explained correctly. However, I was still thoroughly unimpressed with this. The board was too busy, the pieces were boring, and I found myself pretty anxious for it to be over. There are countless games I'd rather play. [Update: I played this a looong time ago, and I wouldn't mind giving it another try once Rio Grande Games reprints it. At the rate they're going, though, I should be safe for another 10 years.]

I really enjoy the connection aspect of many railway games, so I naturally sought out this game.  I finally was able to play my copy and had a thoroughly good time.  While in essence a connection game, it is also very tactical.  Getting into cities first is a huge advantage, as is skillful use of the escort letters.  Our first game had three different people winning at different times with the final win determined by only a single point.

What crap this game should be.  Medieval Merchants my ass, this has nothing to do with anything either Medieval or with Merchants.  A non-gamer friend took one look at the game and said oh this is what you guys mean when you talk about a pasted on theme.  This was before we had even begun to talk about it.  By all rights I should loathe this game.

But I love it.  This is a wonderful game lots of tough tactical decisions, plus it alows for the ability to utilize a nice light long-term strategy.  The short turns make up for the lack of any significant player interaction (which I usually demand in games).

If you can get through the overly convoluted rulebook (just think Foundations/Internal/Income/External) there is a highly rewarding game underneath.  

Now if only they could have picked better colors (honestly light brown and dark brown what were they thinking).

Another, big joke is that they have coins on the box, but instead there is awful paper money inside.

Regardless, we like to think that were are placing fast food restaraunts in malls.  Trust me, it makes the game.

UPDATE: In all the times I'd ever played this game it was only with six.  I finally played it with four players and it is almost broken.  What a contrast.  I give this a rating of 2 with four players I can't see how this could even be playable with three.  Remember only six players, five if you must otherwise you are wasting your time.

Just played again after many years. Played the basic version, where all cities are opened: DON'T DO IT! This version made the towns almost irrelevant, taking away a significant part of the game - the connections and route build-up. With all cities open, it simply became a race to expand into the high-valued cities. Would almost drop the rating, but I need to play it again with the regular rules.

The rules are fairly straightforward yet the game itself presents some difficult choices, such as whether to add to a city or collect income, when and how to use your escort cards, and what one branch to occupy.  The battles in this game can get pretty cutthroat.  Maybe my rating will increase upon further playings, although I&#039;m not sure because it has such a claustrophobic feel.  Overall, an enjoyable game.  One caveat is you may need a timer if playing with people who fall in the &quot;analysis paralysis&quot; category.

This game was painful.  It had elements that reminded me of Power Grid, and that's definitely not a good thing for me.  Just like in Power Grid, the board is ugly and covered with a bunch of cities where everyone is trying to build a network of houses, and the cities are linked by routes that cost varying amounts, with the numbers listed on the routes.  There is serious downtime between turns as everyone takes a long time to calculate all the different routes they could use to expand their network of buildings.  It's very mathematical and dry and tedious as you are constantly calculating the costs of building and the payouts from doing so.

Very under-rated in my opinion.  Resembles Power Grid and the 18XX series a little, but quicker game play for sure.  There is a vicious one game learning curve where you see what your mistakes were and adjust in an immediate replay in game 2.  Probably not for the social/casual gamer, but if you're a gamer or "semi-gamer" with some experience, then you'll enjoy this game.  Game play varies due to the disk placement feature.  Would like to see a reprint in 2007.

RATING: 7
At the end of every turn you expand into a  new town or city. But first you get one action in every city where you have presence: either take income from that city or add another one of your houses to it. Income is based on the number of empty spaces left in the city for houses to be built in, so the more houses present the less income the city will yield. But for the city to score points it must eventually be filled up and whoever gets the points is (roughly speaking) the person who placed the most houses in it. Players quickly get in each others' cities, creating a dilemma between increasing revenue to expand elsewhere and adding houses to try and be the one who scores points for the city. It's a real interesting twist on the whole "build your engine, then score points" trope in euro games- usually a self absorbed calculation here depends largely on what other players are doing.

I like games that focus on a central idea and don't have much clutter added on; Medieval Merchant is such a game, with an idea that is intriguing and original. Only worth playing with 5 or 6 as the board doesn't scale to lower player counts. Also, like a Winsome game, you need clever players at the table for this to really shine, as players need to be mindful of keeping each other in check.

Very dry and excessively computational, this is definitely not recommended for those adverse to calculating and recalculating their income and expenditure round after round.  The tension between collecting money and extending influence is an interesting one.  However, I found the game to be a bit too lucky in rewarding those with better marker draws, especially allowing players with a steadier source of earning to collect VP more readily than those without.  Does not seem like it could offer much in terms of replayability, as there is almost no variable factors besides when a city is opened.  Would like to try again with a full complement of six.

The gameplay mechanics reminds me of the roll checks of D&D and card play of MTG. I like the concept of playing endurance cards because it makes for some interesting choices.  The inclusion of competitive play and a cooperative mode with a few acts makes for a worthwhile purchase.

This has a similar premise as 'Warhammer Quest: The Card Game": A group of adventurers fighting their way through a small fantasy story. While Warhammer Quest focuses on the puzzle aspect of the fight, Aventuria is a more light-hearted dice chuckler. The deck-building aspect here is minimal, but the game has duelling mode, where the heroes can fight against each other (probably best in team mode and therefore for 2 or 4 players). Fans of DSA will like the fact, that the quests in this game mimick the first published original DSA adventures, however, the story-telling part is thin.
This game definitely needs some expansions to add variety and there are already some on the horizon.

Some borrowed mechanisms from Magic, with all the good parts ripped out and die rolling added in. The decks are all very straight forward with no room for clever play. I found the duel mode combat so dull I didn't even bother trying the co-op adventures.

Since 1991 I had the DSA Virus! It captured me for 20 years. 
Less time and more work stopped it. 

This is a glimpse, back in old days and a faster way  back in this magical world.

Played the co-op scenario with all 4 players and actually really enjoyed it. It is reminiscent of MtG and other cards games of that ilk in that your have your specific deck and do specific things i.e the dwarf fighter is slow but hits hard, that kind of thing, and then combat is very D+D roll a d20, aiming for specific target numbers or below, fluff the roll and you get fate, which can be spent on various things, or then roll your d6 for damage.

A nice mix and plays surprisingly fast and flows well. scenarios are well written with several (very D+D like) skill checks to begin which give minor bonuses/penalties before you play the combat part of the scenario... it is just a same there are so few scenarios... I am not sure this really has the legs, I guess it depends on how fast new scenarios come out

Not my type of game. Heroes vs monsters, rolling dice until one side dies.

However, if you love dungeon games you might like this game.

Love the art and design. Discarding cards to play cards requires agonizing decisions. Getting all the expansions and sleeving most of the cards.

Watch. KS $44+10. MM preorder $35. Base only has 1+3 acts, not much story content. Story on rails. So buy below $25.

The forest expansion is $21 @MM and only has 1+1+3 acts.

Wow, this game offers so much. And the price (around 30 Euro) is really spectacular (compared to US publishers). Can be played fully cooperative (extra adventure mode), two versus two or everybody against everybody. Cleverly borrows mechanisms from Cthulhu LCG (using cards as resources), Pathfinder Adenvture Card Game (dice rolling) and Star Wars LCG (life point wheel). There are four heroes (each has a deck of 30 cards). In your turn you draw cards from your deck, use them either as resources (which means you can not use them otherwise but they act as payment for using other cards) or ativate them (permanent or single time). Once you run through your deck you can not reshuffle but must make the best of the permanent cards in front of you. The dice are used for attacking other players or monsters (in coop mode). Highly recommended.

- Very nice Gameplay (feels like "inspired by Magic TG")
- beautiful Graphics (as always with N. Schäkel)
- Overall high Quality
- 2 modes (Duel & Adventure) both very challenging and FUN to Play
- Expansions already incomming (increasing max-player-number!)
- Awesome "introduction to the dark eye" for the non-dark-eye-people from the "Mainstream" -> leight way into (possible) P&P-playing

Great Adventure Card game. And very good memories for my RPG time.

Hervorragendes Abenteuerkartenspiel - obwohl es Würfel hat. Es erinnert mich an meine RPG Zeit. Ich bin mit DSA angefangen und habe die Abenteuer damals gespielt. Die hohe Bewertung also zum Teil aus Nostalgiegründen.
Das Spiel ist fordernd aber einfach zu verstehen.

Terrific, clean fantasy dungeon crawl type game.  Everything about this game is simple.  Some folks understandably knock this game as too "vanilla" or "dry" but I see it as a solid foundation upon which to build expansions or even custom content.  Great art too, which never hurts.

First impression after two-character solo game --- my favorite card RPG adventure game yet!  This beats out Mistfall (overly complicated), Warhammer ACG (too puzzly for this kind of game), and definitely Pathfinder (never warmed up to it).

Aventuria plays fast, your character gets more and more powerful every single turn, lots of difficult options between discarding cards for endurance vs playing them, easy to learn, and the d20 mechanic is fun!

Ended up gifting this game.  It was ok.  I would have kept but I do not like keeping games with demons in it.  The special ability was for a demon ability so the game had to go.  I would have played more except for that.

Played the first 2 scenarios in co-op mode with a friend. The game is very thematic and has a great card management mechanism. The powers are nice and the characters all feel different in their play styles. So far, I love the adventures. I hope this game gets some love from the community and we see some home-brewed adventures. This is at the very least on par with Pathfinder and Warhammer Quest. 

P.S. I was missing a card, but the publishers (Facebook page) were quick to respond and replaced the card withing days.

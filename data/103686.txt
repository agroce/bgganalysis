like: good interaction. trading, multiple paths to victory.
dislike: the events are a tad fiddly, and not really necessary except for more advanced players.
overall: good game for 4+ players, i like the "shoot the moon" path to victory. i give it an extra point for having the good trading interaction.

Another example of a rulebook laid out very poorly.  Lots of references to stuff you don't find out until later in the rules.  Thankfully they're short.  They could have included a simple (see page #) to stop the flipping back and forth.

Our first game was overlong, but there were constantly interesting choices to make.  The forced trading felt really novel.  The art is great--almost too intricate, though.  I had to squint at many of the elements.  Still, good box size and design!

Bruno Cathala is one of my most respected designers, he produces a lot of good stuff, and a lot of not so good stuff. This game is in the second category. It is not a bad game, but it is not great at all compared to other of his works. It is a card game with exchange mechanics and a set collection way to mark points, not so original and nothing special here. The good point of this game is the way we can evolve into getting a lot of good upgrades with our sets.

A good game, but not so great.

The object of Mundus Novus is to create big sets of cards (every card different or all the same).  You do this by building a card drawing (caravels) and/or saving (warehouses) engine.  Card trading allows you to iron out the luck of the draw a little.  Mundus Novus starts slowly and takes a long time to gather pace.  It feels like a great many short steps, punctuated by hardly any interesting decisions.

The artwork is rather nice and production quality is decent.  We struggled a bit with the rules; some of the game concepts seemed poorly explained.  The lack of player reference cards is irritating.

Simple cardgame with minor poker elements and minor drafting elements. Gameplay is very straightforward for my likes. It seems to me that at the first turns you should collect cards of the same number in order to buy the ability cards and later in the game you should collect cards of different numbers in order to score VPs. The artwork is nice.

Mundus Novus is a solid game, even thought not so balanced it is still fun. Even if it's not my cup of tea, I can see its value and my opponents liked it more than I did. I won't be playing it again, but it's still a game I can recommend to those who like trading, set collection and a lot of randomness.

In Mundus Novus, players are trading goods from the new world.  It's a card game (with beautiful art-work by the way) where players try and collect sets of all the same or all different types of cards.  

Going for cards of the same will gain the players access to special powers like more ships or places to store their goods(cards).  

Going for all different will let players get money which can help them win the game.

There's a nice flow to the game as the goods-cards dance from place to place around the table.  Goods are distributed and then swapped from player to player.  There's the sense that you are getting a lot of game in a small package but I fear that there might not be a whole lot of room for variant strategies.  

It seems like buying more Ships is almost always the right play as your just not going to be in contention if you have 1 ship to everyone elses 2 or 3.

It does seem to be a game worth exploring tho.  I'll be looking forward to more plays.

Initial Impression: There's some beautiful, colorful artwork in this game. I was surprised that though the game mechanisms are fairly straightforward, the game lends itself to multiple methods in order to achieve the victory objectives. Having to decide between retaining Trade Master, claiming points, or building an engine for future growth makes the game feel meaty. I really enjoy the trading aspect of the game and am anticipating experiencing the game with more players.

This is an enjoyable, fairly light and quick trading/economic game with some depth.  Scales between 3 and 6 players very well, maybe a bit long with 5/6 and any new players.  The development powers are all interesting and the two different victory conditions add tension.  

Special mention for the artwork - it is fantastic!

A strange game about collecting sets, with an unusual card trading phase at the start of each round. I enjoy this one, though the iconography on the special powers cards could have been more intuitive!

A race to trade in sets of cards to get money enough to trigger the game's end and hopefully have more than anyone else to win!

Really enjoyable, snowballing game rather like St Petersburg I suppose, with your options each turn being to either gain snazzy cards that let you build your engine or points (or very occasionally both).

First time out I won by dint of being forced down the points route through not being able to get the cards I needed. Everybody built massive engines but gathered few points and by the time I picked up some big point scorers at the end I was so far in front they couldn't catch me. Of course we will get better at timing it next play but the mere fact we are discussing that means replayability.... a lot to go at here.

Second game - got caught out by somebody getting the full set of cards 1-10 - it is easier than it appears, got to watch out for that!

Es un juego de cartas. En cada ronda, hay cinco cartas de desarrollo y se reparten cinco cartas de recursos a los jugadores. El que tengo menor valor de flota se convierte en "maestro de ceremonias" y decide cuantas cartas se van a intercambiar los jugadores (2,3 ó 4). Tras realizar los cambios, viene la fase de desarrollo, en la que cada jugador, empezando por el que diga el maestro, puede canjear cartas de recurso iguales por una carta de desarrollo (según el valor de la carta podrá escoger la primera, una entre las tres primeras o cualquiera) o cambiar cartas de recurso diferentes por dinero.

Se puede ganar consiguiendo 75 doblones, o reuniendo  9 recursos y 1 reliquia. Además, la primera carta de desarrollo determina qué evento está vigente en esa ronda.

Es un juego entretenidillo. Sin grandes pretensiones. Sirve perfectamente para pasar un rato.. además es rápido (menos de una hora) y admite hasta seis jugadores.

Played once.  That is enough for me.  And I ended up winning with the all at once 10-card cool play.  In spite of that, this game feels very meh.  There is almost no theme.  It is really just a light euro or even just a set-making card game with a tacked on "trading" mechanic.

A very strange, but intriguing game. It reminded me a bit of the Traders of Carthage, not only because of the theme, but also because the rules are so unintuitive. With both games, however, once you've figured them out you realize that they have some very original and unique things to offer. It is still impossible for me to remember in which phase I need like goods and which requires different goods. Plays well with two.

RATING: 6
A unique blend of set collection, engine building, and an odd little trading system.

Basically, players have a hand of cards, where some of the cards will be traded around via a set trading phase each round.  At the end of the round, you'll want sets of cards in your hand either in order to buy special power cards that will make you better at stuff, or to just cash them in for money, which is used to win the game.

First player to either 75 points, or to form a very specific combination of 10 cards in their hand wins, with multiple strategies available in order to hit that 75 point threshold.

I really enjoyed it because I was wholly prepared to be underwhelmed, and I was suitably whelmed. It's Ronseal... it does what it says on the tin. It isn't wanting to be more than what you have in front of you. You can decide between going for sets that give you the points or forgo them in deference to special powers that could potentially really help you get the points nearer the end.

Having the power to decide how much should be traded is also invaluable. I know how many cards I am comfortable giving up on, and I don't want someone else making that decision for me. In the game I played my opponent got the power that constantly locked me out of that role, but they got it too near the end and I had already managed to get myself in a position where I didn't mind so much about that. I really liked my Fleet, because the pirates were not coming up as much as the Fires that killed the other player's warehouses.

I think there is some good strategy in controlling (as much as you can) what Event was going to come up in the next round as well. This is 45 minutes well spent. It did not outstay it's welcome at all. I'd like to play it with more, but it worked nicely with 2.

RATING: 7
This game wasn't fun with only two players. I want to try it with more before I give up on it.

I like the set collection idea, and that it plays with a higher player count, but our group rarely hits 6 players now.

There are a lot of special actions due to cards, and special rules/events that caused the game to bog down a bit. It might be less clunky with more players and more trading, but with only two players, we ended up looking at the rulebook every time we started a new round.

Update 2018-01-14: We played with three players. The game was a lot more fun. We also realized that the game really is a race to 75 gold - we focused a lot less on getting development cards. By the third game (second for Aeris) we already sped up the three-player game to 45 minutes.

I'd like to play with more than three players. Playing today changed the game from a 6 rating to a 7 rating for me, and from a game that I was going to trade to a game that I'll keep.

This game got better after we understood the rules. We started to "race" to 75 gold. As a result, the game didn't drag like it did on our first play. I think that when all the players are familiar with the game, it can be quite quick.

This is a pretty unique economic game with a lot of fun options. The rules are pretty simple (even if the rulebook scores big on the Vague Meter*), and the game manages to feel fairly light and breezy while presenting dilemmas with real depth. This game has a really great pace where you start out pretty constrained, and then soon everyone is rolling in goods and vying for Trade Master while also trying to setup epic combos to get them even MORE goods or precious development cards.

The development cards give you a few different paths to victory with two distinct strategies (doubloons vs. shooting the moon) and lots of little sub-strategies by which to accomplish them. It's really lovely, and I think they will keep the game pretty replayable.

The way actions work mean that every card is potentially useful to you, giving you a high degree of flexibility on how to take your turn and how to trade. As such, it's pretty rare to have a turn where you accomplish nothing which is really nice to see in a card game.

My only issues with the game are all easily-solvable-with-BGG components/rules issues. The rulebook is pretty vague in many spots, and I think a player aid would have been nice here just because passing around the rulebook can be a drag. The special cards also took some rules-referencing our first time through as they're textless, but there are so few of them that it's not really a big issue.

I've only tried this with 2-4 so far and I suspect this is sort of the sweet spot. I imagine things get a little chaotic with more players as things (especially the development queue) may change too much by the time it gets back round to you, but the whole Trade Master mechanic should mitigate that somewhat (i.e., you may have some useless turns but as long as Trade Master keeps shifting, so should everyone). Would definitely be willing to try with more players.

*Things not made clear in the rulebook:
-You can do each of the 3 progression actions once per turn.
-You can use multiple Inca Relics as wilds, as long as you have at least 1 good to pair with them.
-Doubloons are kept face down.
-This is made clear at the end, but using "doubloons" and "victory points" interchangeably is confusing.

Not the easiest game to learn or teach.  The card play mechanics are a bit cumbersome.  Super prone to AP for those so inclined.  Trading is wonky.  You either take another player's offering into your hand directly or dump it in the market for one you want there. The players who get the ship development cards first are at a distinct advantage.

This game is based on the trading and part of the construction mechanisms of Mare Nostrum; some liberties have been taken to turn these into a game of their own. My first game was sufficiently positive to purchase a copy, spurred by a [i]very[/i] agreeable retail price: I am not usually into card games, but this one features such a familiar mechanism with stylish artwork that it all seemed to click pretty nicely. 

That said, there are some annoying issues which need to be mentioned. First is the unclear wording of what you can do with your cards after the trade's over. I was explained that you can do [b]either[/b] a combination of different cards [b]or[/b] a combination of equal cards [b]or[/b] a combination of jokers. But thanks to the author's infamous incapability in creating clear rules, the ors should in fact be [b]and[/b]s. Second is that nowhere is explicitly stated when the players receive incoming from buildings and the like. That would appear to be a crucial detail, but no, the rules are silent. The answer: at the end of the progression step. Third is that there is no player aid in card form: the tables you need to remember are all printed on the backs of the rulebooks. Whoever thought this up at Asmodée should be subject to extensive box thwappage. I recommend a full sealed Mundus Novus-box to drive the point home rather painfully. 

[b]Update[/b] Two plays in, with 3 and 5 players. In both cases I found the game slow and plodding to start, and once it picks up some pace it is nearly over. I think the problem is that in the boardgame you know that the purpose of trading is breaking up valuable sets, or forcing a particular card onto the table—in Mundus Novus you [i]don't[/i] know what cards people have (save for those obtained via the caravels, or by counting cards—which is not realistic to expect and only leads to a guesstimation). So the decision of number of cards to trade as well as subsequent trade is a rather artificial business with the only clues provided by the developments... And those are not only slow to appear; they are also rather limited in their function. I guess the idea is that players look at those developments and then start playing a game of reverse psychology in their heads: [i]That guy has a development which turns any card into a 7, 8 or 9. So if I put out a 9, he is not likely to take it. But wait, he can exchange it at the market for this crap that's currently there and so withhold it from that other bloke who’s been keen on collecting 9’s. Choices, choices...[/i]—which doesn’t make much sense because there’s too little information to go on.

I’ve downgraded my initial rating by 1 point; although it is good physical value for money, provides some distraction for an hour or so, and accomodates up to six players, I should have been a bit more careful with my decision to purchase the game.

[b]Update 2[/b] Sold off the game. I was just too wary to play this... Or rather, to have to pass over it all the time. Let someone else bear that responsibility.

Wow - I really enjoyed this game.  There's a fair bit of look ahead, of judging how your actions can influence what you can and wish to take.  I love tech trees, which this game has done nicely.  Even the events have enough look ahead to anticipate them.  My one complaint might be one of the ending conditions requires you to keep track of the total value of a pile of face down money chips.  That's a fairly small annoyance, though.  I'd like to try the game again to see if I like it as much as the first time.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
Mundus Novus es un juego con unas ilustraciones francamente bonitas, un precio muy recatado y un desarrollo interesante (personalmente me gustan los juegos en los que te vas construyendo cosas/mejorando tu lado de la mesa, y este lo cumple: puedes construir almacenes y carabelas, "alistar" mercaderes, contratar a grandes personajes del siglo XVI...).

¿Por qué no lo considero entonces un juego notable? Seguramente, por su escasísima rejugabilidad.

En Mundus Novus las partidas se hacen bastante densas (el juego tiene bastante más miga de la que aparenta, por lo que las partidas se te hacen más largas de lo que en realidad son) y solo hay dos maneras de ganar (por doblones o consiguiendo una escalera perfecta de mercancías): eso hace que una vez que has jugado un par de veces y ya has podido explorar los dos caminos hacia la victoria, se te hace muy cuesta arriba el volver a sacarlo a la mesa. No es que tengas malos recuerdos de él (más bien al revés), sino que simplemente te da la sensación de que ya has visto todo lo que podía ofrecer.

Comentar también que, pese a su temática, no es exactamente un juego de mercadeo: tú no negocias con otros jugadores para intercambiar mercancías, sino que vas cogiendo las que hay encima de la mesa cuando te toca el turno.

Excellent components; chits and cards
2 to 6 players, which I always prefer.

Read the rulebook and it left me like 'before the wind' game impression. A simple card game with too many twist in gameplay (note that twist here mean a bad thing). It seems a simple game (it is) but I just don't like how much complexity (the game is not complex at all, I just can't find the right word to express it) there is for a simple card game.

A decent game, especially at £8 which is what boardgameguru was hocking at (at time of writing). It is essentially a rummy game (Gin rummy is probably closest) but it has a trading between players system (though there isn't much haggling or negotiation), card events and upgrade cards. It also gives you two routes to victory, money (points) or getting a 1-10 straight. The theme isn't deep but it works and there is enough room for clever plays with particularly when choosing upgrades and maneuvering events to make it worthwhile.

This is my favorite Cathala game, and probably my favorite Laget game too.  It has most of what I like about Mare Nostrum, and none of what I don't like about it.  Its also great with a wide range of player numbers.

RATING: 7
While most games boast this, I truly feel that Mundus Novus encapsulates the "Easy to Learn, Tough to Master".  Its a fun game and can become quite competitive once everyone knows what they're doing.  Not my usual type of game, but I'm glad i own it.

RATING: 6
A breezy card game with charming art and surprising depth, although some of the concepts seem difficult for some players to grasp, especially as you need to refer to the back of the rules a lot to determine what can be traded in for what.  Should have come with a players aid.

Elsőre nagyon ígéretesnek tűnik. Ketten is játszható, és van benne bőven kiismerni való még. Szép, hangulatos, gyors és akár hatan is játszható. Nomeg hajós. Mi kell még? :)

Sikerült több játékossal (5) is kipróbálni. Nagyon jól működött, bár talán kicsit túl könnyűvé vált a tökéletes sor megalkotása a 75 ponthoz képest.

Trading without negotiation? I'm interested. This is a set collection game in which the sets can be used to either gain VPs or to improve your "technology" and thereby your future scoring potential. Simple premise, simple execution, with quite a punch for such a small game.

What prevents me from giving it higher marks and only places it in the "nice diversion" category is that you cannot know what your opponents are looking for. Putting up goods for trade is done blindly and accidentally handing someone else the game on a golden platter is certainly well within the realm of possibility. You won't know until it's too late.

Also, the rules are pretty bad.

This game is slowly growing on me. I'm still on the fence with it. I need to try with my wife.
The game is ok, but I feel that should be at least great. I'm going to decide after a few plays with my wife what to do with it.
I hope she like the trade system.

RATING: 8
The game requires a couple of plays to settle into the rhythm of it. During a round it has phases of play that do not have a correlation with any other card game - there is no hook to hang from while you learn. In fact you need to approach learning this game as a mid-weight eurogame. I.e. There will be separate mechanisms that lock together and some special features.

RATING: 6
Simple set collection game - each turn 5 cards are dealt randomly to each player and then a couple of mechanisims allow you to get more cards and also to improve your sets to maximise your ability to acquire either cards that give advantages or points. With largely random card draws you have little information so this is just a set maximisation exercise with little ability to meaningfully impact the other players. We found the trading mechanic issue referred to in the rules quite off-putting although the game remains playable - has spoiled the game play a little.  

Ok filler game, the components are all good.

Opinion: I found it suitable to play with non casuals, only need to explain how the trade phase works and they need to make sets of cards. If the sets are going slowly, the game can last more than these kind of games deserves. Nevertheless I enjoy the game thinking my sets and what cards should I need

This is a really cool game for its size, but I'm not sure how much replay value it has. There's a tantalizingly wide range of choices but my games have all gone the same way-- the person who has both boats and warehouses gets a 10-card win when the people going for money are a round or two away from ending the game.

RATING: 5
It reminded a bit of "Andromeda" with the similar trading and set collection. Not bad, but my first game took almost two hours with just three players - at least twice as long as I think it should take. I cannot imagine playing it with six. Also, the disconnect between the two victory conditions (money and perfect set) bothered me a bit, and strategy is a little obvious, no matter which of the two paths you choose.

Takes the best part from "Mare Nostrum" to form a filler card game about trading. 

The box says 45-60 Mins. which may be true if everyone knows the game well and plays fast. If that's not the case, it will probably take much longer than that, which hurts the game a bit, as it does repeat itself from round to round. There are no cool abiities in this game, just a few bonus cards you might get.

All in all it's a fun trading game with some depths to it. Nothing great, but a fine game.

In a type of boardgames of its own, these card games in a small box that offers a hugely unexpectedly big gaming experience, this is currently my favorite. A HUUUUGE game in small package. I love basically everything about this game: the nautical sea-fairing theme, in which you are basically doing business with all these New World goods, such as spices and etc. and then you are shipping them back home to the Old World. Again a bit shady period of exploitation and genocide. Highly educational though. However, in this game there's no war, no battles and murdering; it's all about business, trade, auction, buying stuff... Then there's real, once lived characters in the game, for example Hernan Cortes and such conquistadors and others like them. You can sort of hire them and by doing so acquire some special skills they offer. With more players, the value of this game grows a lot. Even with two players it's enjoyable. The only reason why I don't give 10/10 is that game can be a bit too long sometimes, visually it could have looked better and game is sometimes a bit too complex for its own good. So it's not for everyone. Still, when there's only cards and some tokens, you really can't go much higher and bigger, more epic. Highly recommended.

Me encanta este juego. Llevamos más de 2 años jugando con él y sigue apeteciendo una partida de vez en cuando, especialmente cuando estamos de vacaciones (esto no puede decirse de muchos otros juegos con más renombre). Aunque es un juego de cartas, el azar no es decisivo y permite distintas estrategias para alzarse con la victoria. Es totalmente obligado imprimir la expansión "Nuevos horizontes", que puede encontrarse en la página de este juego en la BGG, ya que añade una alternativa nueva para vencer. Es un juego imprescindible en mi colección, dentro de su categoría.

Me gusta:
- partidas rápidas y emocionantes.
- reglas sencillas y fáciles de asimilar.
- es estratégico.
- la ambientación histórica.
- ideal para 3 ó 4 jugadores.
- perfecto para llevar en las vacaciones.
- la ampliación "Nuevos horizontes".

No me gusta:
- a 6 pierde frescura y se vuelve caótico.
- unas cartas de ayuda hubieran venido bien, pero eso tiene fácil arreglo casero.

Se parece a:
- ninguno que haya probado antes.

A neat mechanism in the card-sharing (one that works well in Nicht Die Bohne!) coupled with an overly arcane scoring system and a lot of opacity as to what anyone else might be going for. Few opportunities to affect other players or to change your play based on what they're doing.

After two plays, the main strategic question is "do i try to get a better card in front of me, or go for cash?" with a sideline of "do i focus on warehouses or ships?" The trading phase has much complexity for little gameplay benefit. I'm not opposed to the game but I'm not much of a fan either.

Nicely designed card game based around the trading mechanism in Serge Laget's Mare Nostrum, the trading mechanism being for me the best part of the earlier game.

The special power cards are used to build a card engine which you then use to buy points. Certainly there are many other games with this overall approach, but this one has a decent amount of player interaction through the trading and the ways the different strategies adapted by the players feed off each other.

There are some useful player aids here on BGG which help players into the game.

The idea of the game is good, trading cards for sets and using sets to buy advancement cards. But the actual play strayed closer to 2.5 hours (instead of the advertised 45 minutes).

With 6 players, the game becomes draggy and long, a fact exacerbated by the stupid symbology on the cards. Constant referrals to the rulebook for sale prices and various counting mechanisms slowed the game horribly. This game desperately needs a player aid, and even then, I don't think all the charts could fit on it.

This game is pretty much the commodity trading from Mare Nostrum (one of the few games of that type which I actually can play halfway decently and enjoy) surgically removed from that game and given a smaller, more manageable host body. It's Mare Nostrum Das Kartenspiele, but where those experiences are often pretty unfulfilling when compared to the original game, this one really holds its own. Play is pretty straightforward and snappy, and it works with fewer than five or six (though I think it's probably better with more.) They did a really good job on this one. As a bonus, it just plain looks beautiful.

Would only ever get this card "filler" plus the PROMO cards, that conveys a real feeling of unscripted trading in a game, for me, if/when the boys showed a real interest -AND- we had ready access to a larger group of 4-5 players.

Mundus Novus uses the trade mechanic from Mare Nostrum, where you take a card offered by an opponent, who then takes another card and so on. The cards are exchanged either in sets of similar cards to get a tableau of powerful cards or in sets of unique cards to get victory points. The first part is interesting, as you have limited cards to get what you need. But although the game progresses, the card costs remain the same, removing the tension and leaving a game where the luck of which cards that happen to be available at a player's turn determines the outcome. I can't help feeling that the end game could have been so much more interesting.

Another solid game from Bruno Cathala for me.  My only concern is the perfect hand victory and how others react when you pull it off.  You need the right people who will appreciate your victory, not want to throw their cards because they were winning up until that last round.  :)

Neat card game that I'll play anytime, but I bought it largely because I wanted a game that could occupy six players for 45 to 60 minutes, and it totally fails in that regard. It takes at least an hour and a half, unless everyone is throwing strategy to the wind and deliberately rushing.

The theme, trading in the Mediterranean yet again, is totally pasted on. The cards illustrations are great, better than its nice but a bit uninspired box cover.

It takes the trading mechanic from Mare Nostrum and adds some development "engine building" factor. Sadly, the engine building part is not really interesting. Most decisions are pretty much evident, and it doesn't create enough differenciation between players. At the end, it's just about who will be the luckiest to get the different cards needed for the victory first.

The trading part is not more interesting. Players will go first for the goods that are more scarce.

My games have lastd quite more than 45 minutes. And even if it's still significatively shorter than Mare Nostrum, I prefer to invest more time and play Mare Nostrum, a better game in all regards.

Get cards (valued 1-9, plus a wild), each player places X cards on table, player take turns taking tabled cards from other players, build sets and sequences. Trade in sets for special power cards, trade in sequences for VPs. The special power cards allow to get more cards next turn, or save unusable cards, or give you straight VPs, and then all sorts of variations of the like. Lather, rinse, repeat, until someone builds a card collecting engine that allows them to get to 75 VPs or build a 10 long straight using a wild. It's a bit repetitive, but the competition for these engine cards are what drive the interest, exploring their power. Being generally un-obnoxious, it'll get some play as it works fine in that light Rummy type card genre.

This game takes the trading mechanic from [b][size=12][thing=174785][/thing][/size][/b] and made a game from it. In my opinion this is a very neat game but lasts about double the time I want it to. There are some neat events and happening with the hand management but all in all it outstayed its welcome. It is a game I could revisit if the opportunity presented itself, but not high on the list to do so.

RATING: 4
this is the game that takes the trading mechanic from Mare Nostrum and makes it it's own game. I thought I would enjoy this a lot, but people had a really hard time understanding it. Once they did, we had issues from the Technology cards where certain cards would just sit at the bottom because nobody wanted them, so we'd be encountering the same event over and over again. 

There was also disconnect when people wanted to know how to fight the pirates from the pirates event, but you don't. We ended up calling this in the middle of the game due to people not really feeling it. I'm willing to give this another go with a lighter group sometime, but I don't feel super enthusiastic.

I wonder if this isn't a mechanic too far? The core idea of how the trading works, but the effect of trading seems disconnected from the method of trading. This is to say, yes, all the cards get traded, but it's such a confusing circular system, you sort of want some additional benefit or effect to result from the trading process itself, since the system is so out of the ordinary.

March 2012: Downgrade from 6 to 4.

I thought our first game was slow because two players suffered from AP. We didn't have that problem in our second game.

The game is just really slow. Avoid this game at 6 players! Perhaps the maximum for this game should be 4.

February 2012: One play, six players.

Bottom line: This is a card drafting game that moves quite briskly, even at six players, and offers more bite than other Euro card games. So if you're looking for a six player game for gamers accustomed to Eurogames that plays about an hour (the box cover's 45 minutes, I think, is an underestimate), then seriously consider Mundus Novus [i]despite my cranky comments that follow[/i].

=====

I'm not a huge fan of Euros, and this game is yet another example:
- Not very interactive
- Tactical depth achieved through convoluted scoring rather than game mechanics
- Does not offer much strategic depth in relation to the rule complexity and time to play the game

Pros:

* A card drafting game that handles six players reasonably well; turns move quite quickly. There are two kinds of card drafts: one where each player determines which cards are available to be drafted, and a more "traditional" buy-cards-from-a-queue draft add variety to the game.

* Art work is lavish. A nice touch to the components: the development cards and the resource cards are differently sized.

Cons:

* This is *not* a trading game. In each round, players reveal a number of cards that will be drafted by all the other players. You want to reveal cards that players really want because that will enable you to pick cards earlier. However, you can't simply ask players what cards that they want because there's no guarantee that a particular player will be able to get the card you want to offer. So the "trading" phase is largely a guessing and hand management game; the decision about which cards you want to offer to trade comes down to not offering up for trade the cards you want to keep.

* This game is soulless, like most Eurogames: base mechanics that make no sense in relation to the theme, and it has overbearing scoring and arithmetic for such a middleweight strategy game. The first main mechanic is the trading phase mentioned previously, which does not feel like trading at all. The second main mechanic is right after the trading phase in which players buy development cards with melds of resource cards that are the same or points with melds of cards that are all different. Several issues here:

- Buying stuff with melds is very gamey. (The game comes with 90 money tokens, but you never spend those; they represent points, so there's no real economy here.) However, because players are only focusing on two kinds of melds, and players cannot accumulate cards from round to round (with the exception of certain development cards), this makes the trading round feel a bit repetitive.
 
- To find out what you can get for your meld, players have to reference three tables. It's astonishing that the publisher did not include player aids that contain these tables. Players have to share the back of the instruction booklet for them.

* Not very interactive: The trading mechanic doesn't feel that interactive since you can't directly trade with a particular player. I suppose players can collude among themselves and ignore a particular player in the lead, so by the time that player gets to draft a card, he'll have less choices, but I have the feeling that when most people play this game, it's more advantageous to focus on your goals rather than screwing someone else over. Same thing during the development card purchase phase: one could purchase a card another player needs, or purchase the few fuck-you development cards available, but again, it seems more advantageous to focus on your position.

Neutral:

* Strategically straightforward and not that subtle, but for a relatively light game, that's not really an issue. Here, you have the typical Eurogame conflict: at what point do stop buying special power "development" cards and start focusing on winning? If players are willing to analyze the scoring structure and pay attention to their opponents' progress, this decision is probably, I'm afraid, straightforward.

This a neat little set collection game. Collect sets of like goods to collect utility cards that make you more effective, collect dissimilar cards to trade in for money (victory points). There is a bit of manipulation of events which becomes apparent after a few games and it plays well with two. Sadly, I have no idea how it plays with more, but I anticipate that it is more fun than two.

I'm really not sure what to make of the game.  The mechanics are fascinating, but (a) far too many choices were arbitrary due to low information, and (b) it was too easy to get locked out early with a couple of bad hands.  Overall, the early rounds are influential but random, which is unsatisfying.  In any given round, there are a few cards you definitely want, but once you get those (or they are taken by others) the rest of the plays are pretty arbitrary.  What cards you draw at random seems more influential than how well you play your turn -- your choices matter, but luck overshadows the good stuff.

Not a bad trading and special ability card game. Reasonably fun. Nothing particularly ground breaking, yet it all fits together in a sub one hour package that plays easily enough.

Take your card allocation, then trade some using a forced trading mechanism, then buy victory points and a card from the available ones on offer. Do it again and again until someone reaches 75 points or has laid out ten different card values.

It won't ever knock my socks off - I'd rather play several other card games, but it's nice enough.

Much better than I would have thought from reading the rules.  I like the way the trading works, but there is a little wonkiness in the Trade Master role with how you have to give a card to anyone who was shorted.  Aside from that, it will keep your interest and the developments keep driving you to get better sets.  Very solid!

Es un juego bastante táctico por las muchas decisiones que puedes tomar a lo largo de un turno. Y muy rápido, como te descuides, alguien conseguirá las 75 monedas antes que tú. Pero lo mejor es que es una gozada ver cómo crece tu empresa a medida que vas adquiriendo desarrollos.

RATING: 1
A bit unique euro that seems more fun than it actually is. It's set collecting plus hand management, with a bit more rummy feel than most set collecting games. Central mechanism is interesting - called trading, though it's kinda open drafting between cards players decided to share. 

Sounds good, no? But while it seemed novel and intriguing I was mostly doing two things per turn - building my engine or getting money. It's this weird situation: it feels like an interacting game, but I was doing my own stuff, not really caring much about what others are doing, except in terms of doing it faster and better. But at least people look each other in the eyes when playing this, so that's good. Other people's comments suggest the game gets samey with repeated plays and I'll trust them on this. 

EDIT: actually bland and uninspired. Uninspired is a crime punishable by 1.0 rating ("please don't make such games again")

RATING: 6.5
Played once with 4P. I'm not really sure what to think of the trading mechanism. On one hand, it does seem rather random as you can never be sure of what your opponents are building up in their hand. On the other hand, paying attention to what your opponent is collecting might give you a slight edge as you can work towards picking up cards that they might need. Also, if 4 cards are selected for trade, then the phase might be a little long.

The development cards make the game interesting, as they slowly inch you closer towards the victory conditions in different ways. Not too fond of the theme, but the game is quite abstract anyway.

RATING: 6
Interesting little set-collection/card-drafting game. The meat of it is in the trading phase, where players each lay out [i]n[/i] cards and progressively draft from the other players until they return to their original hand-size. Sets and straights can then be sold for victory points, or for development cards granting various special abilities. There is also a perfect 10-card hand that grants instant victory.

There are several major problems, though: 

1. Because you can't keep cards between rounds without first buying certain development cards, success is heavily dependent on luck.
2. Development cards are not created equal and there is a positive feedback loop to getting the right cards, especially the right cards early, which can leave some players left behind through no fault of their own.
3. If the round's master trader draws well and decides to limit trading, others will have no opportunity to improve their position.

That said, the trading phase makes up for a lot. It's an interesting little game that doesn't outstay its welcome.

[thing=103686][/thing] is a hand management and trading card game, one that is reasonable interesting: first because it works well enough with a smaller number of players, which is not usual in trading games; and, second, because is not often that someone is locked up in trades, by being avoided, mostly because all cards have a value (sometimes the person doesn't even want to trade them) and to make your sets, you might simply need what someone else put for trading, regardless if that person is winning or not. And the trading phase is rather lively, since there is no denial - no back and forth, haggle or deals.

I also like that there is a progression in the game: you don't finish as you start - you grow your trading company, by taking developments (personalities, warehouses, ships, etc), thus increasing your possibilities. And is enjoyable to have an "all in" option (winning by having a set of all 9 goods plus an Incan relic), as even way behind in money, everyone is still in the game, hoping for that perfect combination, in order to pull off a big upset.

[thing=103686][/thing] isn't particularly great or sensational, but it does work well and delivers a fine experience of play, being easy to teach and to play, and having interaction without being mean or agressive. The decisions are mostly in the tactical order, however the developments do lead into an overall strategy. There is a sizeable amount of luck in the game, but the trading phase serves to reduce the strength of it. The time of play is reasonable for what it gives. In the end, a good game that won't knock your socks off, but will likely offer an OK time.

I felt like this was almost great.  I really like the trading mechanic and enjoy other aspects as well.

However, it felt like the game was designed to make it so you can't really utilize the mechanics much - you need to get a huge number of extra cards coming in before you can ever trade in your cards for more than one thing in a turn, and by that point the game is mostly over.  (This can vary a bit depending on how cards come out.)

Additionally, there seemed to be a few balance issues - most clearly the Incan idols, which are extremely strong and give a clear advantage to whoever happens to draw them.  (This could potentially be interesting if the caravel mechanic meant there was some cost to getting yourself better cards, but the vast majority of your hand will be random card draws.)

Provisional rating, one partial play with 3.  We learnt it from the rules, and it took a long time before we thought we understood what was going on. It's not that the game is complicated but the rulebook is vague on some basic concepts, and is lacking examples of play. Once we got going, I liked it a lot, though after all the headscratching we only had time to play half a game.

RATING: 5
Interesting mechanics, and fantastic artwork, but woefully underdeveloped.  The trading dynamic is simple enough that it is mastered very quickly, and doesn't lead to major decisions.  The economic engine building is also uninteresting, and comes down to "Is now the time I should stop buying cards and focus on VPs, or should I wait for next turn?"

That leaves the development cards as the mechanic that differentiates good players from bad.  The mechanic for purchasing those development cards is terrible.  The cards vary wildly in strength, which the game attempts to fix by having a card row that makes the ones that have been out less expensive.  In practice, it's too easy to get the "expensive" cards.  As a result, everybody snaps up the good cards early, and then the card row fills up with crap that nobody wants to buy, and you end up hoping that a good card flips up after the player to your right makes a purchase.  Even worse, the event that happens is determined by the card at the front of the row every turn.  Same card sticking at the front of the row every turn because nobody wants to buy it?  Same event, over and over and over.  

The game that's in the box shows promise.  I believe it could be houseruled into something that works, but the basics are bland enough that it doesn't feel like it's worth taking the time to do so.  It's not meaty enough to be a main course for an evening, nor simple and cute enough to be a good gateway game.  Might have a spot for groups looking for old-style simple Euros that are almost superfiller and that can accommodate up to 6, but even that's a stretch.

☺ Jeu de stratégie mixte (quelques éléments aléatoires et/ou de hasard raisonné).

►JOUEURS, NOMBRE(S) QUE JE RECOMMANDE:
# Meilleur :
# Recommandé : 4

# Non-essayé : 2, 3, 5, 6

►COMMENTAIRE(S) ABRÉGÉ(S):
± THÈME : plutôt plaqué; mais agrémente le jeu.
- Aide de jeu : 1 inclus mais j’aurais aimé qu’il y en ait 1 par joueur. Manque certaines précisions importantes.
+ Configurations équilibrées selon le nombre de joueurs.
± Icônes : sont relativement aisées à apprendre et à mémoriser.
- Matériel : insuffisant; le nombre de pièces de monnaie est insuffisant (1$).
- Règles : déficientes; certains points de règles manquent de structure et/ou de précisions (voir : FAQ, forums, etc).

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
1e essai à 5 joueurs. Bonne première impression pour l'ensemble des joueurs malgré quelques incertitudes de règles.

2e essai à 4 joueurs. Partie moins enlevante que la 1e mais était-ce dû au joueur en moins ? 

Actuellement, je le conserve parce que je ne connais pas un autre jeu possédant une mécanique « d’échanges entre les joueurs » similaire et j’aime bien quand un jeu possède une particularité que les autres n’ont pas. Je souhaite aussi l’essayer dans ses autres configurations. À suivre…

►EXTENSION(S) ESSAYÉE(S): 
& "5 cartes promo" : Oui.
& Je n'ai jamais essayé l'(les) autre(s) extension(s) parce qu’elle(s) n’a(ont) pas assez soulevé mon intérêt pour me convaincre de le faire.

The mechanics and art seem very nice. It's a shame that the theme is about the Spanish taking advantage of the New World.

Small box.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/outpost_mobile/user/Vroenis]Outpost mobile[/url].

Card game.
Bidding for Trade Master (who trades first and buys/sells first).
Resource trading between players and common market.
[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/set_collection/user/Vroenis]Set collection[/url].
Light-medium weight.
Light-medium player interaction (trading).
Light-medium theme application.

It's the light-medium game! That's actually a good indicator actually. I quite like it. At first there seems to be a lot to keep in mind but the phases separate everything nicely, shouldn't take too long for newcomers to gain competent literacy. The game does accelerate sooner than some might expect so at least two games might be in order to get a feeling for the dynamic. Eventually players will want to keep track of what goods others take during trading, and what ability cards they have in their respective play areas.

I love that this whole game is in two decks of cards and some tokens. Brilliant!

What I like-
Tension between scoring points and developing your trading company. The trading of goods for your sets or sequences. The ability to have more cards if you invest in ships or warehouses. Or better quality of card if you get merchants. 

What I dislike-
Can be hard to keep track of opponents victory points in a game that ends when 75 points is achieved.

I liked this one a lot.

It's a trading/set collection game based on the trading mechanic from Mare Nostrum.  A good 45 minute filler.

16th Century Spaniard ship owner seeking wealth by exploring the new world. Player trading card game. Bid for master trader with an interesting Chinese auction aspect. Set collection combos. Rarity of cards have increasing purchase power. Score points with sets of different cards. Also a shoot the moon win condition. Light but can play long. The meat and fun of the game is the poker variant card trade phase where the leader determines how many of your dealt cards are put face up for a turn order draft. It has a theme but I would say the game is more abstract.

Great little card game! Quite a few different strategy for such a small game, only down side that i can think of is the playing time might be a little too long for a filler type game. But i look at it as a medium weight card game.

Not a really innovative theme, but beautiful art and great ideas create a fun trading game, that doesn't turn into a 'take that' game because of the structured trading mechanic.

Little known game from Cathala, I like this game a lot, plays well with 5 and 6, and is easy to introduce to no gamers since its mainly cards.

Neat mechanic where you choose to buy cards or victory points with different combinations of cards.

Art by Vincent Dutrait is a plus!

Good card game using the trade mechanics from Mare Nostrum... the rounds are similar and the engine building is very small, but it's fun enough...

I quite liked it, but not again with 6 players. 3 or 4 might be best.

Once we learned the rules (deceptively deep game for such an 'easy' trading card game) it was a blast.  I can see this being played a lot in future meetups.  Really outstanding 'Euro with cards'.

Very cool card game that could be described as "Mare Nostrum: The Card Game", if only more people knew about 'Mare Nostrum".

The production, artwork, and pacing are all top notch. An excellent little surprise of a game.

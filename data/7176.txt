This is my first Panzer Grenadier game, and I have to say I love the system.  Simple, elegant, yet enough to make one think about tactics and maneuver.  The Bulge game is a great intro to the system, with scenarios ranging from small (with only a few units on each side) to Team Desobry with lots of infantry, armor, artillery, and loads of action.  Play moves quickly, and the game has a variety of scenarios.  Highly recommended.

Despite that I have many of the games in this system, I keep struggling with it.  It's nothing in particular, but the sum of a pile of little things that bother me, though scenario design is a big part of that pile.  Much depends on the particular game box played, for some reason.  Still, I have issues with the LOS and Spotting on hills.  If the publishers would just fix the issues these present then I think the games would be very good, actually.

Airborne (Introductory Edition) and Elsenborn Ridge are probably my favorite of the games in this series.

Note: apparently there is a 4th edition rule, and a new series of boxed games, but I have looked into them.

The new 3rd edition rulebook (available for free download from APL) finally puts the PG system over the line from "near miss" to "solid fun."  Not nearly as detailed as most other tactical games, but the learning curve is very easy and there are far fewer markers to deal with.  There are hundreds of available scenarios with an incredible array of different units, and with the exception of a few scenario special rules, the 16-page rulebook covers pretty much everything.

You won't get the flavor of ASL from PG, but then again, you'll be pushing counters and rolling dice within an hour of opening the box.

The only issue with Bulge is that some of the maps have tricky terrain depictions that are a nightmare if you try to use the old "10% Rule."  The new rules loosen that up a bit, so it's less of an issue.

Panzer Grenadier does the Bulge.  Probably the best maps of the series, backed up by now familiar rules and low counter density.  Fun system.

I have modified the game to have some actual casualties in it now, plus I cut the scenario turns in half- And it is now a wonderful game.
I love mounted maps, large counters and Tanks. 
I wish the tanks were 3/4 perspective like the infantry and artillery....

Nice scenarios with plenty of armor. Many scenarios are very tough for one side or the other, but that doesn't matter much for me since I play solo lately.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
 51 scenarios, ranging from 9 turns to 140 turns. I'll stick with the ones under 40 turns, as I like the shorter ones. With the action segment alternating between both sides it is a great game for both two players or solitaire play which I really like in a tactical game. Both the counters and boards are pleasing to the eyes. Units are at a platoon level.

A good veteran gamer buddy and I sat down sat. night to work our way through this. The free five minute rules we found to be indecipherable.
Poorly written and hard to see. We abandoned them for the full rules set and worked to learn the game. The first two hours of attempting scenario 1 were painful as we struggled to understand the rules, which are some of the worst written and organized I've seen in some time.

My buddy Steve and I have more than 60 years of gaming experience between the two of us and have played all complexities of games. The rules here, however, came close to turning us away in frustration, only because of their poor organization. It was hard to understand some of the game aspects as certain rules had key elements of themselves scattered and buried in different rules sections. One example is the morale rules, in which leader effects are partially addressed in the leader rules and not the morale rules etc. Another is that no where in the direct fire rules does it explicity state that attacks are against all the occupants of a hex. We found that under the definition of "direct fire" in the front of the rules.
There were many, many examples of this phenomenae we found. Nevertheless after constant cross referencing of the rules and making copious notes and reminders, we did figure the game system out. 

In short, I felt there was a nice game in there hidden behind a very poor rules set and some awkward design decisions. As we both had some past experience we clearly felt this was a nice try at a Squad Leader - Lite game, marred by the rules production.

I found it very dull, mostly an accounting excercise. I think it is because of the limited variations  in the terrain, most boards have one town, or hill or a big block of woods (and many of the scenarios say to ignore the woods or hills!!!). The battles thus center on taking that one location. The game thus consisted of limited manuever, the formation of a giant scrum, then game play consisted of target selection, order of unit activation, where to use leaders....different strokes I guess... Finally the ugly top down view for tanks is a major turn off, but one I accept as a necessary evil for some games where facing important...but that's not true here.

PG was first wargame system which we played with friend. I have some fond memories of it. Although we have find lot of small gaps in rules and thinks which we do not like that much (for example we house-ruled assault) added degraiding terrain and so on.

I did not like fact that with lot of infantry games tend to bog down a lot (due to lot of morale states) at the end games were sometimes lot of rolling rally attempts which was not lot of fun. But I did like tank battles or small battles were only few infantry units were.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6

Initial rating based on solataire play of small scenarios.  

PG: Battle of the Bulge is an easy playing system that captures the chaos characteristic of the small unit actions during the Battle of the Bulge.  The small scenarios are more challenging and interesting than those included in the introductory PG game, Airborne.  The rules (Third Edition) are clear and the game plays quickly.  The PG system is quickly supplanting TCS as my platoon level game of choice.

Nice little game still in 2015!  Maps were holding this series back IMHO when it first came out and I didn't buy into it. However 21st century maps much better and system, despite a few things which seem odd like no move&fire, is generally sound. I can see a lot of other wargame designs built into this low complexity system. 

Great if you like platoon scale gaming!  

I just bought a copy of BoB as my first PG game in 2015 and it's still pretty hot! I passed up Desert Rats about 10 years ago because I hated the map. The gaming shop was cool enough to take it back and I bought a copy of Advanced Tobruk instead even though what I really wanted was a platoon level game. Panzer Leader (and to a lesser extend Panzer Blitz) were firm favorites of mine back in the day and I just love that scale of game. I don't wanna fire every bullet and carry every weapon, though I certainly see the appeal of squad level/individual weapon games. With platoons, you can re-enact battalion and regimental level engagements.

Panzer Grenadier fits the bill for me after having had a few trial games with Battle of the Bulge. The maps are a lot better than Desert Rats and having a large collection of games I can scavenge and improvise my own maps for the desert if required. I've even taken to using the move/fire counters from ATS in my PG game! But this game is all about scale: 

- time is longer and challenges preconceptions I have from other games. In 15 minutes, a lot can happen in combat, or troops can become inert. There's some criticism and doubts whether the PG system is bloody enough, but let's face it, we're mostly comparing it with other games such as ASL and ATS. I've read a ton of war history (like so many others here on the Geek) and war is just a variable thing. Things can crumble in minutes, or can take hours, with no result. I suppose this game makes that possible.

- area of hexes is a big old plot! ATS and ASL are 50 meters or yards, while PG is 200. That's roughly a 4x4 hex plot of land on a squad level game, or 16 hexes. Imagine if it's a house to house struggle, and that can take quite some time in a squad level game! At first I was thinking the game isn't bloody enough in close quarters but when I think it isn't necessarily hand to hand combat when units are in an Assault then it makes more sense. In ATS units battle to the death right then and there, but an Assault is more than that. It includes the approach, positioning, and waiting for the right moment. 

- scale of the units is perfect for my interest and that's definitely a personal thing. You can attain an interesting blend of units while not being bogged down representing every piece of equipment. PG also is fully compatible with different modules and theatres which made the PB/PL thing a little difficult with platoons with less tanks with Wehrmacht (PL) or more in the case of the Russians (PB). With the Russians, I can see the weaknesses inherent with a rifle platoon in PG while in PB, they were strong companies!

- rules. This is soooooo important in this day and age if you're like me and want to maximize gaming/dice rolling time at the expense of complicated rules. PG rules are written well enough to dispel most doubts and now the 4th ed is out there it's a polished act. The PG-HQ.com site also hosts an annotated set of 3rd edition rules which incorporate official rulings and clarifications. Compare this to ATS which was a bl**dy rules nightmare! I can learn the game while playing and make decent progress in doing so. More complicated than Memoir 44, but much less so than ASL. A nice in-betweener!

- maps at this scale are excellent for recreating snippets from books and other situations. There are 5 hexes to a kilometre and 8 hexes to a mile. A battery of 88's is not going to dominate the entire map typically so there's some room for maneuver depending on the scenario. I think platoon level games bridge that strange gap between strategic regimental games like the AH classics, and the low level detail of squad gaming. There are not many company level games out there and I think they might not be as successful in blending tactics and strategy as much as this scale. 

Just a mixed bag of my first impressions, and hope this is of use to anyone reading who could be considering the game. Overall, I'm really happy I got the game and glad the passing of time has resulted in an improvement in map quality.

Another Bulge game but on a tactical level.  The system utilizes the Panser Grenadier from Avalanche Press.  Good efforts.  This expansion is required to play the scenarios in Panzer Grenadier: Arctic Front Deluxe Edition.

My favorite of the PG series, which grew on me the more I played it, but there is a generic quality to it that I didn't care for.  The leadership system, once understood, is excellent and makes it rise above Panzer Blitz & Panzer Leader.  I gave the Panzer Grenadier system up in favor of the Advanced Tobruk System games by Critical Hit.  I know - apples to oranges.

I'm more of a strategic, quick-playing boardgamer, so when I saw this game in a hobby store going OOB, I took a chance. This is a great game (and series). I was surprised, despite the generic maps and counters, how it felt like BotB. Gameplay is quick and highlights the importance of leaders, something I wan't used to with tactical games.

Update: AVP shipped this game (before reprint) with hard mounted mapboards. Their new game, Elsenborn Ridge came with card stock, snow-themed maps. I decided to use those instead to give this game an even more Bulge feel.

RATING: 8.5
Funny, but I've only recently begun to fully appreciate this game. I am a big PG fan and have had this game for about 5 months. I enjoyed getting my ugly hands on the maps (numbers 9-12) as so many PG supplements use them. Yet, somehow, I felt less than fascinated by the military situation studied in this game. I dunno - I suppose it's the way people go on and on about the Bulge; it just put me off. Now, in the last week, I've played three scenarios and they are really good, tense situations. The scenarios also show how well PG models combat, because the killing rate is horrific, showing the power of the tank armament and the infantry automatic weapons. One strange thing is, there are no rules for hand-held AT weapons as in some of the other games in the series - even the 1939 Polish unfantry in White Eagles get to knock tanks out.Good stuff from APL

I think this boxed set is a great first buy for anyone considering to get a taste of Panzer Grenadier. The first scenarios are good, just look out for the somewhat complicated hill/spotting/limiting terrain rules. I dare say this is of the few game that I really enjoy playing solitaire nearly as much as FTF, especially in combination with this great website called Panzer Grenadier HQ.

Just getting into the PG system(this is my first game--Beyond Normandy,on the way),first observations,for a Tac game the luck factor is quite high(this is not a bone to me,I like Tac games with a large element of luck)---I use my Inf.boldly,get right up next to the enemy and assault, best way of taking them out(but first soften up the enemy with artillery),I find;I don't worry about Opportunity Fire much,because my experience so far is it has less than a 50%chance of hitting your units as they move.One thing I don't like about the game is,even if you use lots of "Off Board Artillery" on an enemy hex ,it's still a chancy thing that all that fire power will effect the enemy units;but I still recommend those Tac lovers to get into this system(Time and Money well spent).

Very preliminary first impressions (played only two turns of scenario 1):  My first exposure to PG ...  Map is butt ugly and rules seem very awkward.  Hard to see units on board because there are so many leaders everywhere.  No fire/move or move/fire is a big downside (maybe it is an optional rule?).  Units are too busy and hard to distinguish what is on them (not that most of it matters anyway).  Disappointed so far ...  (Gave it away and then bought it again, just because I was so impressed with number of scenarios.)  Will give it another try.

With one scenario played through to completion now, I rate this game pretty high.  This system is like Panzer Leader on steroids, and I mean that in a good way.  Not overly complicated system but lots of modules and scenarios to choose from.

RATING: 6
These scenarios just don't grab me, and I dislike the odd T and L shapes that the maps are arranged in some scenarios

Now that Elsenborn Ridge has been released, the only reason to own this boxed set is because so many other great modules depend on it, though honestly, if you just got the Bulge 1 + Airborne map pack from AP, you could probably just use ER counters for most scenarios that call for the Americans.

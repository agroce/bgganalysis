Second entry in the GIPF Project, this one attempted to introduce the element of Time.  Unfortunately, the introduction was made with small hourglasses that work 'most of the time' but occasionally just stop.

Add that, and the few blocking strategies the claustrophobic board allow, and each game begins to feel very samey.  

Probably the best thing that came out of this game, was the ideas that helped build the first set of Potentials for GIPF.

Pretty cool little abstract game.  Very unique with the timers, and I love the pressure they put on you.  Plus it makes the game play very fast.  Not sure about the longevity of the game, but I like it for now.

This is a lighter game in the gipf series, but it is so much fun to play.  Still involves some fairly deep strategy.  My 9 year old daughter enjoyes this.

I find about half way through the game, you start having to be careful about your pieces.

Very basic abstract. The sand timers add a nice twist, but are not enough to make it stand out.

RATING: 6
When compared to the great games that are Gipf and Zertz, this looks like just an average abstract game when played without the time pressure, and a highly innovative game which I don't feel comfortable with when played with the time pressure.  Perhaps with more games and more understanding my opinion may change.

The red-headed step-child of the Gipf series, Tamsk really has little in common with its siblings.  Take away the time pressure and this would be a simple, dull game of maneuvre and denying your opponent space.  Time pressure turns this game into something that's much more fun.

Tamsk is not the prettiest abstract.  However, all the parts are solid and durable.

{1 play} The timers are interesting... on the hand I really like them, since I'm not that great at these type of games, so I see them at limiting my opponent more than me... but on the other hand, they were frustrating, as I already feel mentally hindered by the genre :)  Still... another cool concept from Kris Burm, who knows enough to not make the game too deep if timers are involved.

The inclusion of the time element makes the game's design quite unique.  Without the time element, the basic game mechanics create a nice strategic game.  The time element rachets up the pressure just enough to make the game quite interesting.  Not the strongest in the GIPF series, but it should not be overlooked.  [GTI Code: AGSD]

RATING: 8
Wow.  I held out on buying this for a long time but it's great fun.  Easily the lightest of the Gipf series but just so quick to play.  It's easily a filler.  Tamsk is the anti-analysis-paralysis game, hence the reason I like it so much. "So you're taking your time huh? Well cop this 15 second timer!"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tamsk is an innovative, unique and truly four-dimensional game (xyz-time). While other 3D games can be made 4D by simply adding a chess clock, some kind of timing mechanism, or real-time play, Tamsk attaches a non-trivial temporal worth to each hourglass piece. I can't think of any other game that accomplishes this. This in itself is what makes Tamsk worthy of being among the other GIPF series games. You definitely have to play with the 15-second timer to really get into the real game. Further plays may result in a higher rating but I doubt that it will outshine either of the other GIPF games in terms of personal appeal and fun factor.

[i]Posted: 1/21/09, Rated: 6[/i]

I'm a fan of the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/project_GIPF]Project GIPF[/url] games.  After falling in love with [i][gameid=7854][/i] and then appreciating [i][gameid=528][/i], I had to try the rest.  This impulse happened before [i]TAMSK[/i] had been replaced by [i][gameid=31999][/i].

In a fit of irony, the potential of [i]TAMSK[/i] exceeds its reality.  Here is this intriguing game, which uses hourglasses as its pieces.  I marveled at the concept of having pieces which were capable of keeping their own time, and which could expire.  Envisioned strategies of "letting your clock run" during your turn to strand your opponent's pieces were exciting.

The actual game turns out to be quite hectic.  In a manner similar to [i][gameid=2346][/i], you want to keep your options open.  Many times, you can see the available moves along certain routes, while others will be dead-ends.  I haven't played enough times to develop the skill to effectively manage my sand to "let it run," but I can see the desire to sacrifice pieces to limit your opponent's mobility.

Perhaps even more interesting is that the sand timers are not all equally filled.  Whether this is done by design or through manufacturing, they are not all equal.  This would be fine if both sides had even numbers, but in fact the sides aren't equal.  I don't know if this fact affects the playing of the game, but it does affect my enjoyment of it: I'd prefer to have precisely-filled timers across the board.

This residual doubt combined with a game that requires the development of a new mental muscle, make me reluctant to reach for [i]TAMSK[/i] instead of the other entries in this series.  My perceptions might change if only I spent more time with it.

I really like this abstract game.  The way in which you have to manage three different sand timers all at once is very clever.

The sand timers add an intensity to the game.  It's quick and you have to scan and analyze quickly so you can keep your pieces.  Thoughts of letting a piece sit for a bit longer to just build up it's sand reserve is one of the different types of moves in this game.  I like it and looking forward to playing again.  THIS one reminds me a bit of Hey! That's My Fish, actually.

I play just the basic rules without turning over the sand timers, because there's never any need.  The game is very straightforward and not taxing to plan for, so I'm able to make my moves quickly enough to negate the need for timers. It doesn't seem to be the deepest and most challenging game of the series, but we do enjoy pulling it off the shelf to play from time to time.  Sure seems like there's a lot of equipment here for such a simple game, though.

This is a remarkably clever design, one of the cleverest abstracts I've ever played in fact. The use of time in the game (through the timers) is suprisingly subtle, not what you'd expect at first blush. This is highly recommended, and the short playing time makes it an excellent "filler" or side game.

After Zertz, this is probably my favorite game in the series. It's got a strong theme, a variety of playstyles that show for fast-paced, chaotic play or slower, strategic play, and distinctive high-quality components. Even though I like Zertz better, I would say this is probably the stronger game overall due to the option of whether to turn the hourglasses with each move or to pace it more slowly.

RATING: 6
I've been slowest to get Tamsk, in part due to its previous out-of-print status....but mostly because I thought the time pressure element wouldn't be very enjoyable. It turns out that the time pressure doesn't bother me terribly much. What bugs me to some degree is that there really is a fairly big variability in the amount of sand and length of time for the different hourglasses. Its to the point that I feel it affects gameplay significantly. On the other hand, you can always see which timers are closest to running out, so its not like you're going to be unfairly ambushed. The spatial play in Tamsk seems to be the most simplistic of the Gipf games. I haven't played enough yet to unlock the strategy of when to stall or when to rush...but I'm hopeful that this adds significant strategy to the game. I've enjoyed my games of Tamsk. They certainly move along quickly and smoothly. The rules are entirely intuitive. I think my rating may rise with more play, but for the moment I'd have to rank it as a worthwhile game, but last in the line of Gipf games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I bought TAMSK based on the fact that I liked ZERTZ and YINSH, and I had always been intrigued by "the sand timer game". In comparison to the other GIPF project games above TAMSK is pretty light, but it still has ended up being my favourite game from the project to date.

I think the first thing to mention is that I just enjoy the visceral pleasure of flipping the timers over and physically playing the game. It's hard to explain it, but the experience of simply seeing the game in progress is great.

Secondly, the game has depth, but it isn't so depthy as to be inaccessible to more casual players. There is a lot of room for clever plays (blocking, cutting off sections of the board) but the game is never so wide open as to completely overwhelm people either.

Thirdly. the use of time in this is really wonderful and it doesn't function quite the way that one would think that it will. The 3 minute (approximately) timers are not clocks in the sense that you feel like you have to move quickly to keep them from running out, but they shape your decision tree significantly because only certain ones are viable moves at certain points in the game. You can use this public knowledge against your opponent as well, because you know that, for instance, that the timer they just flipped over with almost the full 3 in top now has to sit there for a while to regain some sand before it can be a viable move again, which then allows you to try and do mean things to it. And so on.

The 15 second timer is also a delightful part of the game (once you're ready for it). I haven't seen many double turns result from it, but the way that it can allow players to dither (purposefully) on their turn, or, alternatively, to play aggressively to keep their opponent on the tight time clock, is just another fun layer on an already very enjoyable game.

Basically, this game is not heavy, and it is not involved but it is very fast, has some good tactics, is accessible, and most importantly, fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Seems like more of an experiment than a game, really...it is probably the "least awesome" of the GIPF games and it seems to run somewhat astray of the other games' aesthetics and intricacies but that being said, it's really unique and it is a lot of fun to play.  In addition, it's probably the best suited game to use the potentials with the main game as TAMSK games are very short and allow you to quickly get back to GIPF with a resolution.   Price is a bit steep but it's OOP so buy it while you can!

Second game in the Gipf series. Not quite as good as Gipf or Zertz but still a very good game. If it weren't for the time pressure this would be rated lower, but then it wouldn't be the same game so taken as a whole its definitely deserving of a 7. I'm tempted to give it a 8 just to match my ratings of the other 2. (I haven't gotten to Dvonne yet). But although its close to the other 2 I think they are a step above this one.

RATING: 4
(Played at Essen 2005) Weakest of the GIPF-series by far: despite the time pressure incredibly boring. Once you figure out the strategy&mdash;which really isn't that spectacular&mdash;you can play this on auto-pilot. The time 'management' element tends to equal out because once you start dragging out your moves, so will your opponent, turning Tamsk into a game of chicken. The rules for the hourglass playing are contrived with lots of wriggle room: 'I didn't hold that hourglass horizontal!' 'Yes, you did!' And so forth. Games which are based solely on annoying your fellow player are not fun to play. Looks and feels very cheap too, despite the trouble the designer had to put himself through to get somewhat accurate hourglasses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Has sort of a thrown together feel about it, but the overall experience is tremendously fun.  A very simple, basic abstract lies at the core, but the timers add everything to the experience.  Not so much because of the time pressure, but rather because they force you to divide your attention.  

It's all too easy to forget about the timers completely, then suddenly find yourself in a panic.  Or conversely, you might fixate too hard on the time element (particularly after a close call), and walk right into a trap.  

Fantastic, just fantastic.

RATING: 6
Components: Sturdy pieces. Sand timers can tip a bit precariously at times, but I've yet to see them actually topple. The board is certainly interesting looking, but not as pretty to behold as that of DVONN.

Experience: Interesting options, requiring very quick choices, as I try to hem in my opponent, while leaving myself some breathing room. It is an ingenious mechanism to have each pawn be a living timer, and to have the board spaces have different capacities. I find the game super stressful and mentally exhausting, but it's worth it.

Another premature rating since I don't own Tamsk and the owner isn't a huge fan. Sadly, we didn't play the standard game with the added time pressure so my rating is for the learning game only. It reminded me a lot of Hey, that's my fish (with the benefit of a smaller setup time) and I had fun playing that game. Maybe I'll get the chance to play the full game at a later time. I will update my rating then.

It is not among the deepest games in the GIPF series, but it is an absolutely brilliant idea for a game. It combines abstract play with the time management in a fascinating and a very unique way, thus making up for tense and exciting games. Brain burning under pressure, wahey!

Darn these GIPF games are just excellent:  the unique ideas, the design, the quality of the components, and the ease of play.  
With auctions for this game regularly going for $150 to $275 in the US, this game is still available new in Germany.  With the savings on all of the games I want, I could probably fund a return trip ticket.
Fun.  Not infrequently I consider adding sand timers to games.  Time pressure adds to the challenge.

When I originally picked up the Project GIPF games, this one was in slot #2.

When I first played it, it was still in slot #2.

Now it's all on its own an abandoned... it's a great game, so it's still in as far as I'm concerned.

And Pluto is still a planet.

The added element of time doesn't seem to add much to an otherwise over-simple abstract. The wife likes it though, so that's a plus. She's into the idea that you don't have much time to think and it plays to her advantage since she's a naturally impulsive player.

One of my black hourglasses runs 10 seconds longer than the rest. Otherwise, they're about even.

Because of the analog condition of ending the game, this is my least favorite of the GIPF series.  I realize this is a very original and innovative game twist but somehow it goes counter my natural inability to focus correctly.  Still a lavish and worthwhile game.  The key element here is to not get locked out on the board and to time your moves so that your opponent has the least options as possible.

[Abstract, Time] [2P:9]  *** UPDATE: Absolutely awesome! TAMSK is the best game of the GIPF Project to this pundit. A game that uses real time as a weapon isn't something that's easy to find. (And I'm going to bet that many fans of "traditional" abstracts aren't going to be too fond of TAMSK, but that's certainly not a minus.) TAMSK not only uses time as a weapon, it uses three intertwined layers of time to create a game that's astonishing in its deceptive simplicity but remarkable in opportunities for clever and creative play. This is now my favorite abstract game, beating out its younger sibling YINSH. Its price point is likely to keep it from becoming very common until a manufacturer figures out how to produce the nice plastic hourglasses cheaply. My ranking of the series: TAMSK (9) YINSH (8), PUNCT (7), DVONN (6), GIPF (5), ZERTZ (4).[][][][][] *** Old, pre-acquisiton comments *** Due for RGG reprint some time in 2005. Keep your fingers crossed. One of the few games that employs time as an integral element, but isn't of the same nature as a realtime game (Brawl, Falling), a timed game (a Chess clock), a race (party games like All Play in Pictionary or the auctions in Merchants of Amsterdam) or a game that requires a sense of timing (The Princes of Florence, RA, Puerto Rico). Hey, this would make a good Geeklist...

Tamsk is a pretty cool abstract where time plays a crucial role.  Without the fact that each piece is a sand-timer, it would be a fairly average game, but the time element makes it very unique and engaging.  And it's the only Gipf game that can easily be played in bed!

Nothing great there. I feel the time pressure could be used in a better way. The game itself is bland. UPDATE: Rating went from 5 to 6. Played it again. This time it seemed better, but the strategies are a lot less involved than other gipf project games.

RATING: 1
I very much dislike this game:

1. It's not completely abstract (according to combinatorial game theory).
2. The hour glasses are not exact.
3.It's a hexagonal adaption of the game Quivive. 

Claiming Tamsk to be a genuine game was probably done to circumvent intellectual property rights and amounts to plagiarism. In fact, it's just a variant of an earlier game that was well-known all over Europe (including Belgium).

Highly original game. It reminds me of a long-distance race ("course de fond"). Not because it's a long game but because you know that you can't pulverize your adversary. There are no shortcuts.

RATING: 5
A second game of this confirms my dislike for it. At its heart, TAMSK is a very simple abstract and the entire point of the hourglasses - to create tension - is completely lost because one is rarely at threat of their time running out. It can cause a few problems here and there, but those problems are usually equally replicated in one's opponent, thus equalizing the game once more and reducing it again to a very simplistic game of chip placement and area control. I didn't want to get rid of this because it is part of the GIPF series, but I can see why Burm decided to part ways with it. It really does not have the elegance of it that deserves the GIPF name. It looks amazing and in theory sounds great, but the gameplay is anything but. There are much, MUCH better games out there and I don't see myself pulling this out again, even for the novelty.

I've played this one several times now, and I have to say it's outstanding. The time pressure is great. When I played chess tournaments in elementary school, I loved manipulating the clock (when it came down to that), and now that time pressure element is pivotal to a whole game! I'm in love! I have two complaints: it's not really as pretty as the rest of the GIPF games (though it still beats P&Uuml;NCT by a mile), and the slots for the hour-glass pieces are sort of shallow, so they'll fall over if you're not careful with your move. I'm also concerned that the rest of the game, outside of the time pressure mechanic, might end up being a bit simplistic. If so, that might hurt the game in the long run. But for now, I think this one of the funnest games from the GIPF project.

TAMSK is played in real time using sand timers [i]as the playing pieces[/i].  It's not a frantic game, but you do have to think on your feet.  The real genius of TAMSK is that the timers do more than simply limit the amount of time a player can think about his move.  The administration of the time remaining on the timers is integrated organically as a strategic element of the game.  The flipping of the timers regulates the pace of the game, forces players to use all of their pieces, and allows them to consider not only where to move a piece but also how long to delay before physically moving the piece.  TAMSK may not be the deepest or most famous game in the series, but as a game [i]design[/i], it's absolutely brilliant.

YINSH > TAMSK > PÜNCT > DVONN > ZERTZ

Thirteen plays. Most people seem to see Tamsk as merely a timed three-dimensional game, and as such it would indeed be disappointing. If you take the trouble to explore it with a little more care, however, you will find that it is a four-dimensional game, one in which the manipulation of time is as important as where you place your pieces on the board. Truly a unique game, with the only negatives being the high cost and the occasional inexactitude among the timers. I ordered an extra set of timers from Rio Grande and switched out the ones that were a little slow.

RATING: 7
After playing TAMSK, I can understand why it might have became the black sheep of the GIPF family: with its timers, TAMSK is certainly not a game of long pondered moves (I'm also imagining that the expulsion from the family might have had something to do with the production costs as well!). However, this does not mean in any way that this is not a good game! Rather, it's simply a different beast, and a very fun one at that. 

While it shares with other members of the GIPF family an ever shrinking board (see ZERTZ, DVONN, TZAAR), your pieces are sandtimers -- and you have to flip them everytime you move one. Move a piece, drop a ring: most rings played wins. However, should your timer run out, your piece is locked up and it brings your opponent closer to having a free reign on the board to be able to drop rings without impunity. Managing the sand in your timers becomes as important (if not more) than the positional play on the board making this a nail biting experience (without it being a race or a rush: there's 3 minutes total worth of sand in there).

Clever tie breaker rule: in case of a tie, last sand timer "standing" (i.e., with sand left) wins.

... if only the box were the same size as the others!

RATING: 7
TAMSK is the 7th game of the 6-game GIPF series, the one that was dropped, and became hard to acquire.

It adds the element of multiple timers to the gameplay, and in the end Kris Burm decided it was a stand-alone, rather than a fitting member of the set, and it shared Pluto's fate.

Somewhat like ZÈRTZ, TAMSK works by limiting player moves, but instead of the set acquisition scoring in ZÈRTZ, players must dispose of rings after movement, and the least remaining stock wins.

Players move their own tokens, 3-minute glasses in player colors. If the sand runs out in a timer, it becomes frozen, and the token can no longer perform valid moves- game end is when players have taken all valid moves.

This all makes TAMSK a bit of a manic experience.

First take, it's not a bad game, but it has a very different feel from the other Burm games, while it works something like them at the same time.

Okay, this is pretty silly.  I can certainly see why it was removed from the GIPF project, because it has a very different flavor, less complexity, quicker decisions (and thus more impulse-based).

Probably there's more going on here, but on the first play, at least, what stands out is the slightly frantic nature of the game.    (1 play)

Oh my, quite disappointing, now I see why it was removed, it lacks depth. For the longest time I wanted to buy this as I thought it might be the coolest game in the series with the realtime aspect....nope.  

I mean I came from Dvonn, Yinsh and Punct then I played this and I asked my friend while playing, "is that it, no other hook?", nope. I think that 3 timers were not enough, too easy to keep them going, 5 would have been cool and very hard!  It’s a decent abstract but I’m not sure worth the price and not as good as the others IMO.  I was really looking forward to it with the timer aspect as I thought that would add some real tension but I didn’t get that sense as much as I thought, its there, just not that prominent like I thought.  I guess I need to play it at least a couple more times and there is some planning there but nothing like the games, stick to the tried and true.

One of the Gipf project games.  Tamsk is also the only game I know that uses time as a manipulatable characteristic of the game.

Abstract game in the Gipf series. Players take turns moving their pieces - actual egg timers/hourglasses! - around a hexagonal board. Each time an hourglass is moved, it is turned over and one of the player's rings is placed on the square moved to. Each square has a limited capacity of rings (1-4) and when the capacity is met the square is out of play. If an hourglass runs out of time, it is locked in place for the rest of the game. The game ends when a player gets rid of his last ring, or when neither player can make a valid move. The player with the fewest rings left wins.

Tamsk is a fine, interesting game, and lightningly quick (5-10 minutes pr. game). Recommended.

Initially TAMSK looks like a game of 'frantic' time pressure management, however, you'll soon find that it's the tactical placement of your rings that is most important.

I may actually like level 2 the best, even though it isn't a "complete" game, according to the rules. In ranking this against other GIPF games I've played, I'd put this above DVONN, but below the rest.

First time I played I could not wait to play again ... but after I did play again I lost any desire for it.  An interesting, novel game which seems contrived - as if a group of designers were locked in a room and told they were not allowed out until they had designed an innovative two player abstract strategy game.  They succeeded but I can acknowledge that a game is interesting, novel and innovative and STILL not want to play it.

Generally, I dislike pure abstracts because many players tend to ponder and plan each move and take too much time to make a decision. Not so in TAMSK. The timers give the game a sense of urgency, so players can't think too long. The game however suffers from a lack of depth, and feels too light.

Ebben az esetben maga az alapötlet talán legfőképpen a homokórák miatt érdekes, a lépés+gyűrűrakás alapjáraton kevés lenne. A játszmák nagyon rövidek, az idő szorítása feszültté, néhol kapkodóssá teszi a dolgokat. Igazából elég agresszív játék. :D
Tetszik, de tény, hogy nincs egy szinten a többi gipf projektes játékkal. Ettől függetlenül nem kellett volna kitagadni. :P

I love pressure, tension in games. I also like fast, dynamic games.

Nice idea, well executed.

Tamsk is an entertaing and fast paced abstract game.  I prefer 3 other Gipf project games (Dvonn, Zertz and Yinsh) to this.  Also, one of the timers in my game contains significantly less "sand."  This has been my only complaint with the production values of any of the Gipf games.

I am convinced that the timers needed at least a minute of sand removed from each one so players would feel an intense pressure to make moves well.  As is, the game is far more leisurely than the description would suggest.  Perhaps the board should have been shrunk by one order of magnitude as well.  Either way, the sum of my comments is that the game is simply not tense enough.  Rating is buoyed by the novelty of the concept, which I'm enamored of which has convinced me that four-dimensionality has a place in strategy gaming.

TAMSK for me does not have the immediate appeal of the other games in the Gipf series primarily because I have enough difficulty handling depth, width and height.  Now you add time ... im doomed.  This is certainly a game for a Cool Hand Luke character who can wait for the last / best possible moment and make their move.

While I'm not the games strongest fan, TAMSK is a tribute to intelligent design.  The use of timers is inspired, the height of the various stacks allows the player at a glance to correctly judge the board, even the click of the pieces together make a reasurringly solid sound.  As a game on its own it would be highly regarded but as part of this impressive series it just doesn't reach the heights of its colleagues.

RATING: 8
Of all the GIPF games, Tamsk is the easiest to get people playing.  With the time constraints in place, you can't sit and study each move.  You must get playing, so the game moves right along, and you have little time to agonize over each move.  So new players to abstract games of the GIPF type feel less pressure IMHO.  Both players have to take turns without always knowing if it was the best move.
I have introduced to kids, and they get right into it.  The speed helps as well since there is little down time for them to get bored. It is quite expensive, which for some is a drawback.  I also feel this is the lightest of the GIPF series, but not by too much.  Tamsk is the one I like to play to fill an odd 10-15 minutes.

I like the idea of using timers in a game - forces you to pay attention to all your pieces and forcing to play each one. However the overall game play doesn't compare to any other game of the GIPF project. Still, at 15 mins per game, it's hard to resist pulling this one out every once in a while.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Time as a strategic element - wow!  By far the most original game of the Project Gipf series, though ZERTZ is still my favourite.

You're really playing a territorial game; however, there are points in the game where you may have a difficult choice between yielding territory to the opponent and losing a piece. The time/scheduling element comes to the fore here; by managing the duration of your moves, and which pieces you move when, you can make sure your opponent is presented with more of these choices than you are.

Not for slow players; but you have at least 15s per move; and often more, so the pace isn't that hurried.

Tamsk is not a bad game. It's a very good game of which the biggest problem is... not being Dvonn, or Zertz, or Yinsh, or Gipf. Being of the same series you'd expect it to be a very deep, difficult to get, abstract. Tamsk is easier to play, to understand and to get a grasp on. It's tense, and needs a lot of attention, and it surely introduces the concept of time management to a kind of game that is usually not associated to fast play. It's not fast however, it's just that sometimes you just have to wait before making your move to get an advantage over your opponent. But, in the end, it seems easier than its other brothers, and less rewarding than them because of this.
I still think it's a great game, but maybe the impression of it being a little bit more shallow than its brethren is correct.

(2013): Dernier jeu de la série que j'ai (enfin!) pu expérimenter, TAMSK vient de me faire voir l'ensemble du projet (et des potentiels) d'un autre oeil.

Je vois un certain lien avec la mécanique de DVONN... intéressant!

GIPF demeurant mon préféré de la série, il me tarde maintenant d'essayer une première partie du "vrai GIPF", soit avec l'utilisation de quelques potentiels...

[b]Edit (2017-05-13)[/b]: DVONN est le jeu de la série pour lequel j'ai perdu le plus d'intérêt au fil du temps. Au départ mon préféré de la série, j'ai progressivement descendu sa note à 7, le plaçant en 5e position sur 6 (PÜNCT et LYNGK non notés). 

Comme je considère que cette note lui convient très bien (je reconnais à DVONN de très bonnes qualités même si j'éprouve certains malaises en y jouant), je dois revoir mon appréciation de TAMSK à la hausse. 

En effet, même si je considère que DVONN est un jeu supérieur à TAMSK et que je recommenderais le premier avant le second, il apparaît que, personnellement, j'ai plus souvent envie de sortir TAMSK que DVONN. TAMSK passe donc de 6,75 à 7,25.

RATING: 6
Abstract game from GIPF series. Pieces are sandtimers and object of the game is still be able to move, and not run out of time. Probably the weakest of the GIPF series, since this game requires you to play fair and not try to run your opponent out of time which is a valid strategy in speed chess. Neat pieces, just not that appealing as a game. I've only played the basic game twice, so this is only an initial assesment.

Tamsk has a reputation as the runt of the litter of the Gipf project-- in fact, it has been dumped from Gipf recently. But it's a cool game, a quick, knock down drag out fight to wall something off that your opponent can't move into. This loses points if your opponent is too wimpy to use the 15 second timer. It's about quick, instinctual play, not seeing five moves ahead and boring me to death while you take your turn. I'm flipping the hourglass, and you're making a move. You'd better be focused while I make mine.

RATING: 9
This game isn't as original as it seems at first considering it borrows Quivive's shrinking board principle, sets it in a hexagonal board (as to fit a GIPF project premise) and then adds sand timers as playing pieces (not frequent but not new either, check for instance Quicksand).

However, the mix works well -there's obviously time pressure but just enough to let the players think or even plan a couple of moves in advance, and even though the physical quality of the sand timers might bias the game slightly there's nothing that good play can't mend.

A game that introduces time pressure on each piece. Move it, or watch it die. The last one who can still move wins, so to do well, you need to rotate between your pieces and move them in concert, restricting opportunities for your opponent to move whilst siphoning off territory for yourself (a la Pingvinas). It's not a game I feel I need to explore, but I enjoy the occasional play for the wonderful novelty.

Unusual territorial claiming game of perfect information using sand timers as playing pieces. This enforces quick and tense play lacking in most games of this type.

A very weird idea developed in a game that looks amazing and actually works pretty well. Time is of the essence -- and here, you can manipulate it! One of the most original abstract games you could possibly find.

RATING: 7
Cut off your oppoent's movement options while preserving your own. The basic game play would make for a decent abstract, but add in the timers and it elevates the game to a new level of fun. The timers add strategy as well as ensuring the game doesn't drag on.

RATING: 8.5
This game is an 7.5 for game play and gets a +1 for just being so darn origional.  You MUST use the sand timers to appreciate this game.  This is not a game about racing fast, as at many points in the game, you drag your feet to put more time pressure on the other guy.  (Then he flips the 15 second timer and now the pressure is on you!)  More than any other game I&#039;ve ever played, this game makes time itself a resource to be managed and controlled.  Should be in the library of all game designers.

RATING: 7
Based on about 4 plays, and requires more plays before my opinion firms up.  Right now it feels like that old reeces commercial--"You ignorant slut, you got peanut butter on my chocolate! What am I to do with this soiled comestible?"  (later) "Yummy, I take it all back.  Let's get married."   Tamsk can be broken down into two parts--an area enclosure game, kind of like Go, and the time factor.  Both parts are conceptually simple.  

1.  Area enclosure: The goal of the game is to slice up the board in a way that your area is bigger than your opponents.  I'm still a bit confused as to how to do this...In the opening and middle game, it feels like trying to fence in cows on a wide open plain in Texas--cows are free to wander everywhere, so how are you supposed to fence in anything?  But some strategy seems obvious nevertheless--you have more mobility in the center, it's easier to fence off the 'corners' of the board, you don't need all three of your pieces if you can get 2 big chunks of pie, and it's best if all of your pieces can work efficiently (i.e., not all trapped in the same one area).  

2.  Time factor: also conceptually simple.  You can move a very full hourglass 2 moves quickly and still be full.  Getting the sand somewhere in the middle gives you some flexibility in the near future in terms of staying and going in a region nearby.  By flipping the shared timer just before you opponent moves, you gain almost double the time to wait (as your opponent can't reflip until the sand runs out from your flip).

The two individual concepts are easy enough to understand, but the combination of the two is tricky.  Feelingwise, it's like nothing else I've played.  The most powerful pieces are the ones that do not have to move--almost like the power of the farmer vs. the wandering nomad.  Also, it feels almost like work (I'm a consultant) - trying to manage 3 different projects and meet three different deadlines simultaneously.  Time management is utilized here, and the emotions associated with it.

On the whole, I feels like I'm exercising a part of my brain that doesn't get exercised very much, but I'm hard pressed to describe what part of the brain that is. Very unique, and a game I'm looking forward to exploring in more depth.  

ps.  This is not speed chess.  The time pressure is not like a chess clock time pressure--the game is much simpler than chess, and the three minutes allows plenty of thinking time.  (Maybe too much, even, as there's a good amount of waiting in the games I've played!)  So unless you're in the bottom 30%ile of slowness, I wouldn't be too worried about feeling pressured to move before thinking things thoroughly.

RATING: 8
Damn fine. The timing is not a gimmick, but a serious way to force other people around the board, gain control, etc. The heart of the game.

Another of the "unity" GIPF project games, like DVONN, where the whole game is setup for the last few moves. Maybe better for being so unified, 'cause it's shorter.

Not sure how good or deep it really is (doesn't seem very), but it's definitely refreshing and unique with the sand timers. There is a fun dexterous quality about this game that you don't find with other abstract-strategy games. It's almost like the designer got inspired to design this after getting pissed with his opponents' AP. Worry both about the spatial situation and the timer situation (nearly sounds like special theory of relativity..), and "enclose" your opponent spatially and temporally.  The timers restrict your options in an elegant and controllable way, much better than how cards try to restrict you in games of this ilk.

Probably my favourite in the Gipf series (not just for the gimmick) because it's fast playing and forces player to rely on tactical movement and a good sense of spatial awareness (instead of relying on perfect information). No more AP!!!

The sandtimers work and adds a sense of fun and tenseness. I especially enjoy how players have to set up their pieces for the end game and block off opponent's sandtimers. Great looking game too!

RATING: 8
TAMSK is the most fun of the GIPF games, though I can't say how replayable it is. Easily the simplest and lightest, it's definitely the odd one out. Players have to manage time as well as board position, and there's some wonderfully mean moves to be made by taking as much time as possible for a turn while watching the last grains of sand run out on an opponent's timer. Truly original, there's nothing else like it. If only it were a bit deeper, it might be my favourite of the GIPF series, but then it might not be as much fun. The sand timers are fun rather than frustrating precisely because the game is otherwise so light.

I can see why this got booted from the GIPF Project -- it just doesn't fit in with the rest of the very thoughtful, deeper abstracts in the series. It might, though, if played without the timer. But for me the timer makes the game ... fun! I'm not a huge fan of totally abstract games, especially if played with deep thinkers ('cause I play these tactically, from the seat of my pants), but the timers take care of that little annoyance with abstracts!

--- Summary ---
Players each have 3 timers, starting at alternating corners of a hexagon. The timers sit in shallow wells; wells are present in a regular pattern in the grid, with the wells being deeper moving towards the center. On your turn, you must flip one of your timers and move it to an adjacent space (first 3 turns must move each of your 3 timers), and drop a ring around the well. You may not move a timer to an occupied space or one where the stack of rings reaches the top of the well, nor if it has run out of time. If you cannot move, must pass; the first player whose timers all run out of time loses the game!

Intriguing abstract with sand-timer pieces that flip when moved and a board where previously-visited spaces become impassable. A piece "dies" if it runs out, so moves made for position must be balanced against those necessary for survival.

I don't normally enjoy games with time pressure, but this one is interesting and very enjoyable. I'm not sure I like that there are situations where a player can deliberately dilly-dally just long enough for their opponent's piece to run out, but it [i]could[/i] make for very nasty play between players who are paying close attention -- though at that point I gather that the imprecision of the timers becomes a concern.

Brilliant.

RATING: 6
[RGG 2005 Edition] {GIPF, Abstract, racing; time-limit, connection} {level 1: 6, level 2: 6.5, level 3: 6} TAMSK is a novel abstract strategy game using time as a game element. The time pressure forces players to think and act quickly and have to continually move all hourglasses (otherwise an hourglass will run out). Sometimes, it's funnier to watch the game than play. 

It's not the deepest in project GIPF. It's not very difficult to master this game and formulate a game plan for TAMSK. 

The hourglasses are handy. They may be used as accessories for other games.

What a wonderful little game!  It's a very simple design in which you try to trap your opponents pieces and it works perfectly like that.  The real trick is that the pieces are sand timers so you are really under the gun to not waste time or have your pieces get stuck.  This game would sell a ton if it was available in big stores.

I can't believe this one was removed from the GIPF project.  It's terrific.

While there is something a little gimmicky about this, I quite like it. I like timers incorporated into games, and you can't get much more incorporated than this. Best to play with the addition of the 15 second turn clock, leaving you free to be ruthless with your opponent-killing pauses, because it becomes part of the game rather than a point of ettiquette.

Maybe the least interesting of the Gipf project series. I'm glad it was replaced by Tzaar, which is a game I simply adore. All in all, the idea of the hourglasses is neat, but the overall game tends to be much less interesting than all the other Gipf games... Not bad, but still kinda crude.

Well, the sand timers are pretty cool and I like the concept of using them in a game, but it actually makes the game take longer I think. There are times when you know the move you want to make but are waiting for some of the sand to run so that you'll have more in the top when you flip the timer.

The visually striking timers of TAMSK pour sand for such a short duration that they don't seem to matter, and   uneven production quality means that you should plan on buying 2 copies to get consistent pour durations. Moreover, the first 20 moves are virtually irrelevant. TAMSK is mediocre except for GIPF fans, for whom it should be a required collectable.

RATING: 8.5
I understand that this does not live up to the pure abstract standard, but there is a lot to be said about playing a Gipf game in 8-10 minutes. The pacing keeps you excited, and the use of the timepieces to potentially block your opponent adds a level of tension that I enjoy tremendously. Admittedly, I had to do surgery to two of my timers to get the game to work properly, and that was clearly the death knell for this game for most. I knew this would be an issue going in so I was prepared to do the work. It was very much worth the effort.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The constant rotation of the hourglasses in this game make it hectic as each Hourglass that runs out of sand is out of the game. Need to make sure you use the maximum number of pieces all the while trying to block your opponent from using theirs.

RATING: 8
[thing=108][/thing] is, without a doubt, the best in the GIPF series (well, until at least it was part of it, as it was replaced), possibly because it is the lighter and, definitely, because it is the most fun to play of the group.

In [thing=108][/thing] the goal is to move the hourglasses (each player has three) in order to never run out of sand in the upper part of them nor be locked without legal movements to be made - if either one of these conditions are met, the game finishes and the person that trigger the end, loses. After a player moves a hourglass, she puts a chip in the space it entered - in the outer circle, the limit is one chip, the second circle, two chips, the third, three chips, and the central space, four chips. If the place is already at its limit in chips, it isn't possible to move a hourglass there. This way, as the play goes on, spots will get occupied, limiting the available options, in a fight for position, trying to hinder, surround and block the hourglasses of the other person. It is an intense race, totally tatical in nature, highly interactive and a lot of fun.

[thing=108][/thing] is so pure and simple that, just by watching a couple of minutes of a play, I understood its mechanics, without needing aditional explaning once I got in to play - it is quite intuitive.

The gameplay is deliciously fresh, and even I that don't care much for abstracts, saw myself immersed in the dispute, and the struggle to not let the sand to run out and in finding the best places to move into alongside the proper timming to do it.

The originality of the design also deserves praise.

[thing=108][/thing], to me, is one big step above the others in the series, mostly due to the preference in favoring a more shallow and speedy tatical gameplay over the higher strategic control and depth of options one will find in other titles of the series.

Highly recommended.

A game with hourglasses!? As gamepieces?! I'd beg to say this is not a game of strategy of movement, because that is rather simple: block off opponents. Instead, I consider this to be a game of strategy of time. By managing time carefully and strategically, the game will fall in your favor. As far as an abstract strategy game goes, this does not live up to the others in the Gipf project, but it is enjoyable as a light, quick two player game.

The use of time as a strategic element, rather than just a turn clock, is certainly quite interesting.

Very tense and exciting! The game is decent without the time element, but with it, TAMSK is one of the most unique games I have played. It reminds me of Hey That's My Fish on steroids (although TAMSK came first). The use of hourglasses as pieces is brilliant, and the gameplay is very intense, and rewards strategy as well as quick thinking. Not my favorite of Project GIPF, but a great game in its own right. I can see how it was taken out of the project, as the time element doesn't make it a pure abstract like the others. TZAAR fits with the series better and is my personal favorite of the project by a nose, but TAMSK is still a great game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Tamsk didn't impress me as much as the remaining Gipf-Project titles did (with the possible exception of Pünct). In addition to that, it's also the most expensive title. The problem with Tamsk is that - even though the use of the hourglasses is rather novel an interesting - the core-design is not that impressive. To me, it feels a lot like a prototype, a demonstration of unusual ideas rather than a finished product. Still, not a bad game, but certainly inferior to modern classics like Gipf, Yinsh or Zertz, which in addition offer way more replayability than Tamsk does.

Kris Burm; sand timers; The hexagonal board has several holes in it for the unique playing pieces. Each player uses sand timers as his pieces, and a turn is simply to move to an adjacent space, flipping the timer in the process. The number of times that each space on the board can be occupied is limited, but the more central spaces can have more traffic. The object of the game is simply to have any of your pieces movable when your opponent's pieces are either locked in place, or out of sand. No longer part of the GIPF series.

I seem to like the GIPF series quite a bit.
Really fun abstract!

A fun abstract that cannot suffer from analysis paralysis--the pieces won't let you.  Easy to teach.

I've played a few others in this series. Zertz and GIPF are neat, but this one to me sounds fascinating.

Quite a bit of fun. I&#039;ve only played it twice so take the rating with a grain of salt (hah hah! get it? I kill me).

The "bastard child" of the GIPF Project.  Derided for being too simple.  I don't think that those that deride it understand how unique and subtle TAMSK truly is.  How cool is it that these timers almost force you to make sub-optimal moves, just so you don't actually lose one.  I think there are those of us who "get it", and those that don't.

Once you play this game, you realize that is a lot deeper and more interesting than its look confesses.  With the timers running, decisions about when to move which piece are fraught with strategic subtleties.  Brilliant!

The most original of the Gipf project. Hourglasses has playing pieces is a neat idea. And you must play quickly, but only when the timing is right!

After 2+ Plays: I need to try this again for sure.  The whole concept seems really neat, but in practice it just confused me.

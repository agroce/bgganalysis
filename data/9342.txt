Very nice game with rich options, interesting strategic and tactical decisions, nice components, and a sort of unique auction system.  And the game is not broken: one is basically too busy with getting more buildings and cards, and cannot afford to waste time placing shops until he has got some number of buildings down.  Placing shops doesn't get you as many points as building more skyscrappers (you can build 2 or 3 at once if you have the right cards).

The game is pretty long in the playing, and for this, you get a game which has large amounts of downtime, combined with not terribly interesting tactical play. There are neat mechanics, but there was never any move or turn where I really felt like: "Wow, I just did something cool." or "This is a tough turn." It just sort of moseys along.

RATING: 7
{1 play, 4 player} I really liked it, but I wish it had lasted a turn or two longer.  This may be a feature of the game, or it may be a first-timers thing (I noticed many of the others who feel this way, too, have also only played it once or twice).  So... this may "correct" itself with future plays under our belts: either we'll all slow game tempo down a bit - it's kind of in everyone's control - or we'll have gotten used to the game's natural length and adjusted our strategies accordingly.  Or we'll just get tired of it and not play it that much :)  I hope not.  It's never gonna be a classic for me, but it's different and interesting enough to be one of those games you play a few times every year, and that ain't bad, considering.

Pretty decent after one play, even with my dismal last-place finish. Despite apparent complexity of the game, it flows rather nicely, interaction is good, and I found myself engaged throughout. My feeling is that once I get a few more plays under my belt and figure out what I'm doing, the game's rating will improve.

Not the strongest member of the Alea big box series, but a generally underrated (or at least overly harshly rated) game.  Mechanics are generally smooth and winning the game depends on players' ability (low luck factor).  Game is like chinese food.  While you are playing, it fills you up but an hour after you finish, you find yourself wanting something else.  [GTI Code: TPSL]

First Play: Had limited expectations after reading the rules which are as dry as toast. However once the game started there is more going on with player interaction and screwage than initially meets the eye. A clever game which deserved better press way back when. By current standards, the production quality would prevent this making most tables which is a shame and shows that the prevalent attitude for top flite finishing is excluding a lot of quality play time from the modern audience.

RATING: N/A
Very cutthroat auction/area control game. The auctions, which use different currencies, remind me slightly of Taj Mahal. The battle for districts in the city was very tight in our 4 player game. We used the side of the board with 5 spots per district. The winner got the game in the final reveal of tiles in Central Park. I can see players who are not really on their toes can break this game. If you do not have enough cards of 1 color, you can let a leader get the 2 required "city stop" auctions completed to quickly finish the game. It was fun, but I see this going to the trade list soon.

RATING: 7.5
(2-player rating) When we sit down with 2 players for a "big" game I kinda expect, and accept, that we won't sit down for the game's best. And when auctions are the driving engine behind a game, I don't really expect to sit down  at all! Well, after all the iffy comments I had heard about this one, I finally gave up on waiting for a full set of four volunteers to crack the seal on this one. We now got a couple of 2-player games under our belt ourselves instead, and it seems that big box number 9 not only plays very well this way, two might actually be the sweet spot for Fifth Avenue full stop. Not only has it admirably cracked the 2-player auction game nut, but also, throughout the entire game players will face the Knizia-esque dilemma of having to settle on one set of actions from a pool of equally tempting alternatives. Or more often, actions that are equally [i]urgently required[/i]. As a tight, mechanism rich 2-player auction game, it is more than deserving of its Alea stripes.

To win you need to score more than your opponents. To score well you need to set up a scoring opportunity first, This means getting several of your colour buildings onto a plot in a block [i]and[/i] seed it with a good spread of bonus tiles in the 2 adjacent plots [i]preferably[/i] whilst blocking your opponents from profiting with you. Then you need to manipulate the surveyors so one of the two will start its turn on that plot. Let's assume that that last bit is easy (which it is not), and that you had no troubles pouncing on the bonus tiles you needed to make it [i]really[/i] worth your while (which will a route full of troubles in its own right). That means you can concentrate on the really tricky bit, getting sufficient skyscrapers onto a plot with. It involves getting enough skyscrapers to your active supply pool in time (a la  El Grande), making sure that the scoring surveyor has tracked through your neighbourhood block on its route through town, [i]and[/i] getting the right cards in your hand to win the auction with so you finally can gain the all-important building rights. What you [i]really, really[/i] want is having lots of low value cards to win auctions with, as playing high-value cards reduces the maximum amount of skyscrapers you may build. Pulling it all off will be a great thrill, and a short-cut to your next worry: stopping your high-scoring neighbourhood from becoming one of the two that might get wiped out.

Still with me? It doesn't stop there. Some joker thought it would be funny if people had to worry about the [i]colour[/i] of the cards too, as only cards that match your plot colour (topped up with generic black ones as required) will get you building. Hand-management is as hard as it is crucial, as it should be in an auction game. 

Somewhere within this lies the calm road to victory. If you can pull it off whilst your competitors are playing similar silly bugger tactics around you. Yes, there is not one, but 7 of these neighbourhood blocks to worry about, all at once. Making the most out of what you are presented with is as challenging as making sure that what you leave isn't gold-dust to someone else. It is easy to get so wrapped up in planning and maximising that the end-game conditions will announce themselves as an unexpected cold-shower on your best-laid plans.

It's the sort of game I love, and the phrase "multiple routes to victory" is certainly appropriate here.

Now, it is easy to see why this game rubs so many people up the wrong way. In a multi-player game the board will change dramatically between turns, annihilating any long term strategy. There are single turns that have both surveyors triggering an interruption auction round, and that can transform the board at warp-speed. Worse, auctions are at the heart of this game, and with a full set of players it can be very hard to replenish your hand adequately "in-between events". People who love control and play this with four won't look at this title kindly.

But as a 2-player game, you are far from "lost to the elements". As a 2-player game, it is all about control, with only subtle uncertainties dabbling at the edges. Sure, maybe the game's narrative story and theme are not the most imaginative or best-fitting ones. But, from 2-player perspective, it is amazing how the well the overwhelming amount of mechanisms and ideas seamlessly integrate into one tight dilemma feast. That's exactly how I like it.

It's okay. I'd play it again if asked, but I probably wouldn't be the one to choose. We did do something wrong when we played--forgot to place our initial buildings, which really messed up the scoring, because no one had enough to get the bonuses at each scoring round--but still, I got enough feel for the gameplay. It's not a bad game. There are just others I prefer more, and since I don't get to play that often these days, it's just gonna sit on the shelf.

RATING: 9
Okay, played this twice with two players.  Ffirst game was learning how it played but the second game was when it all kicked in.  Not sure if I would play with more than 3, though.

The game allows you to set the pace.  Yes, I guess you can go business after business and end the game in 10 minutes.  I guess those that do that enjoy wast5ing time.  If you want to win, you gotta play the game.  It's a tough balance in trying to get buildings down and winning auctions. The commissioners are key in pushing the game.  You want to auction when you are ready, and where you want to auction.  

I think this game gets a bad rep and I'm glad I got to play this.  At least to me, it's one of the better Alea's.  I know with two I will get this one out on a regular basis.  Lots of room for tricky play.  The Central Park points haven't been a breaker.  Morgan, thanks for being the only geekbuddy who played and enjoyed this.  It got me to play and discover a great two player game.

Update:  Fourth play.  Discovering more with it.  Watching the colors you and opponents are shooting for.  Maniuplating the businesses to screw an opponent over.  Taking care of what is going into Central park when you pick a business.  Slow down the game or drive the game to the end when you think you have it in the bag.  This is on top of the turn by turn game and auctions.  Bumped to an 8.5.  Good with three, as well.

Update: 9 now after latest play.  I find it an awesome game for two.

May 2015: I am of the belief that three is the shining spot for this one but I'll play it with any number.  The more you play, the deeper it gets.

First impressions were incredibly favorable of this much maligned Alea title.  Second, not as much.  I would describe the phenomenon as compression.  Fifth Avenue expresses symptoms of a game cut short to fit into an hour and thirty minutes.  Yes, it shouldn't be any longer, but it suffers from the designer's attempts to shoe horn it into something shorter.  Still much better than the credit garnered here at BGG.

This is a very interesting game with a lot of intertwined mechanics. A very interactive game. Unlike some other euro games, a lot of the game depends on what the other players do. However if one player has no clue what he is doing it can greatly affect the experience for the other players. I guess that might be the number one reason why this game is rated so low. But.... if you can get a few experienced gamers together it makes for a very tense game. Recommended.

12/20/05 - 2 plays so far, 1 - 2-player game, 1 - 4-player game. Forgot the crucial place two skyscrapers during game setup rule before the 4-player game so we'll need to play this again soon. Initial reaction is good. Noticed that it can be difficult to score a district which you are heavily built up in - so it probably is better to try to be involved in all the districts but this is not an easy task since others are also vying for those lucrative building spots. I LIKE!!!

All the comments about how great this game is if you have the "right" group of players or follow the "right" strategy amuse me.  That is the definition of a fragile game to me -- which isn't that big of a deal if I enjoy the game otherwise, but I don't enjoy Fifth Avenue.  I don't find the game interesting or entertaining.  The strategies are superficial and the game rarely develops to the point that your decisions are interesting.  Taj Mahal is a much more solid game with the same bidding mechanic.

Not so sure about this one. I didn't feel like I had much control. The auctions seemed to get won often because there was noone with enough of the right colour cards to stop them being won. It seems difficult to anything once some one has set themselves up well. Area control with auctioning. I will need to play more to rate. I am thinking a 6 or a 7. I am amazed that this game is from 2004. It feels like a game from 1994. There have just been too many better area control and auction games that have come before this one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Partnerships, parasitism, auctiony goodness, game-end control battles... No I'm not talking about a Winsome title. I'm talking about a euro from the euroiest publisher in eurotown - Alea. This game reminds me that there was a time when 'euro' was not synonymous with 'tamely interactive efficiency engine drag race'. 

In Fifth Avenue, players choose one of four actions on their turn which is then followed by the drawing of currency cards and the marching one space of one of two 'commissioner' pawns. When a commisioner crosses the board and begins again, his previous path is auctioned off one space at a time, with the winner getting to place a skyscraper in the auctioned region.

The actions are simple: place a business to enhance scoring of neighboring skyscrapers, score a district for all the players with skyscrapers, move a commissioner and draw one of the better currency cards, or refill his stash of skyscrapers to be ready for placement.

Besides the scoring action, there is periodic scoring for diversity of skyscraper locations, and endgame scoring of all districts as well as a special endgame district.

The game ends when a certain number of businesses have been placed or building has been stopped on two districts.

The core problem that the game offers the players is: how to make moves that simultaneously maximize your score, set up your opponents to use their actions to benefit you as well, ensure that you are prepared for future opportunities with both skyscrapers in your supply or money, and control the timing of the end of the game to match your resource grabbing actions.

There are other little tweaks like the fact there are different flavors of money - colors and wild; the colors allow you to bid on particular sites in a district, but wilds allow you to augment any bid.

Overall, I am very bullish on this game. It marries a lot of what I like about some of my favorite train games with a really euro vibe. It is both opaque but approachable, nasty but slick.

RATING: 6
This isn't a dog, it's just not overly spectacular. Players work as investors in NYC in the 30's, putting up skyscrapers and businesses and scoring points along the way. Things that work: the scoring system does a nice job in that it encourages people to load up several scrapers in one area, but then punishes them severely if the moratorium is slammed down later. The need to have a variety of busineses, and the encouragement to diversify via bonus points all seems well thought out. The negatives: The two pawns who move around scoring for everyone and causing auctions are rarely used to actually score the districts, and when they do it seems to generally be a mistake on the part of someone along the way. The auctions remind me strongly of Taj Mahal, but are very friendly in comparison as the losers get their cards back, which turned me off a bit. The final scoring in central park is also a little...too random for a game of this type. Basically, this is a solid area influence title with some new wrinkles, I would like to play it some more and explore it more fully, and it's definitely an improvement for alea in comparison to Eiszeit, but I don't think it's the return to greatness for them either.

Components: Nice cards. An adequate board, but neither attractive nor unattractive, and the businesses and skyscrapers are too small.

Experience: There were some interesting decisions, about which colors to collect and in which districts to invest, but overall I wasn't engaged by this game. The limited scoring throughout always came as a surprise, rather than through my decision, and the scoring at the end didn't work out how I thought it would, because the game ended before I had realized my plans.

I'm afraid this one just doesn't work very well for me.  The main problem seems to be that in order for you to score points, someone has to set you up to do it.

The game works, by which I mean that it is not broken, but it is exactly as it looks - bland (come on, even the theme is spectacularly boring).

The ninth in the Alea "bookcase" series, if you're counting.  Players are developing blocks in New York, attempting to erect skyscrapers adjacent to as many different businesses as possible - these score points.  Turns are basically take an action; draw some cards; move a commissioner (with a few exceptions).  The commissioner's path determines what blocks will be auctioned for the right to erect a skyscraper.  Lots to think about here, but the game does feel fluid and plays well.  The final scoring for Central Park feels rather game-y and luck driven, but does force you not to ignore it and throws a little uncertainty into the final result.  One of those games that when your turn comes around, you need to do two or three things but can only choose one.  Good game.

One of the first Alea big box games that completely flopped.  I didn't hate this as much as some people, but it's very fragile, and both of my plays were marred by misconceptions as to strategy on the part of some people that ended the game way too early (with those people losing by wide margins.)  Unless they deliberately lost to get the game over with.

There is definitely a big risk in this game: if your group plays it with the usual mindset "make my investments bigger right now" then you risk killing the game by reaching the ending condition too soon. However, if enough players figure out that there is more to be gained from long-term investment, then this one can become quite an interesting game. Also, the tortuous and somewhat counter-intuitive mechanism makes this one quite enjoyable to me.

I can see why Fifth Avenue gets many mediocre ratings: it's about as Euro as they come, and combined with one of the drabbest alea designs in existence that will scare a lot of people off right there.

A connotation that comes to mind is indeed Winsome, and, somewhat surprisingly, gameplay isn't too far off, either. Fifth Avenue is a game of shared incentives. On her or his own, a player won't be very successful. The other players can always team up to prevent any one player from scoring big, so you need to set up so that you can profit from whatever it is they might want to do.

Fifth Avenue just didn't capture me.  I enjoy a lot of card driven tactical games, and also a lot of auction games, but Fifth Avenue's attempt to blend these mechanics doesn't work entirely.  Firstly this game boils down to understanding the values of placement( a killer for a first outing), along with timing when and where to make a move.  However, with the commissioner being a forced move each round the timing feels more chaotic than strategic.  I just feel the limitations in Fifth Avenue are counter intuitive, and burden the design rather than aid in building tension or making active tactical decisions.  There are some neat elements, and maybe this could shine with a dedicated group of players, or even fewer players than the four I played with.   However,  I seriously doubt a group would be willing to commit to playing this enough times to study it's nuances to make it a favorite, or even likely to be competitive for table time.

RATING: 8
Fifth Avenue is a very sophisticated and well-orchestrated game that presents players with subtle trade-offs and constant scarcity of resources. It follows the Knizia-esque paradigm of offering a bounty of attractive options, but only allowing players to select one or two. I'll admit that the game is ugly, the theme is uninvolving, and the strategies can be a little difficult to grasp the first time through. And if players don't see the strategies, they may end up playing the game in such a way that it ends prematurely and without much excitement. Together, all of these factors mean that many people have probably not given the game a second play, or even a first play. I would encourage you to give Fifth Avenue another chance if your group likes delicate but deep strategy games like Taj Mahal, El Grande, Acquire, Modern Art, and Titicaca. I specifically chose those games because I think Fifth Avenue should appeal to the sort of gamer who enjoys games like those. The game needs to be played with some finesse in order to unlock its potential. It's probably not a game that can be played by force of intuition, as so many German games can. Players must carefully consider what they are trying to accomplish, how they can best do that, and whether they will need the cooperation of one of the other players. I was lucky enough to play my first game with a group that "got" the game, and I loved it from the very start. I suggest playing with four; the three-player game is noticeably weaker.

RATING: 7.5
Two plays, both with four players. I really enjoy the game play of this one; there's both strategy and tactics to consider and there are tough decisions everywhere. One really needs to be aware of the other players and how one's moves might affect relative positions. The down side is that the game is extraordinarily fiddly and gamey for a euro; it's very hard to explain, there are a lot of small and seemingly arbitrary rules that are easy to forget, and there isn't quite enough theme-to-mechanism relationship for a game this involved. In addition, it takes perceptive players to see why you don't want to put down businesses as quickly as possible. What all that means is that you really, really need the right group for this one, which is a gang of hardcore euro fans who don't mind a little abstraction, who can handle the tricky ruleset, and who are willing to play the game repeatedly so that they can milk the most fun from the effort it takes to learn the rules and the strategies. The two things I'm wondering about now are how it plays with three and whether it's better to collect cards in every color or to specialize.

A bland-looking game with bland-looking mechanics that makes me wonder if I should have rescued it from the bargain bin. It plays well enough, with interesting and tense auctions, and it's fun putting down buildings to strategically block your opponents and potentially plan for a big move. Unfortunately suffers from everyone spending so much time preventing others from getting points that there's little left from doing anything for yourself. Overall an average sort of game outside its quirks and I would play it again, except it's perpetually difficult to sucker people into playing it.

Well I was not expecting too much and this turned out good because of that. Really not half as bad as people have made it out to be. 

Area control and auctions, kind of a combo of Capitol (but better) and TAJ (TAJ way better). I thought there was more control than people are going on about, we played a 4 player game and you choose cards from an open draft mostly as well as the businesses so only a little luck. The time is an unknown factor players have some control over, if your winning you can speed it along and vice versa, not sure if this is good, bad or indifferent. 

A whole lot of auctions, almost too many. they are similiar to TAJ only losers get their cards back. The auctions worked okay but because there were so many, people were often caught sitting out because they ran out of cards or buildings. 

There are lots of little things to watch for and enough angst as you need many things but will never have them all. Most things seemed balanced and turns were quick, I did think the 2 stop building powers were overpowered and the one random aspect of the final Central Park scoring was a little strange but it works, a small push your luck element where you need to decide in the auctions if the risk/reward payoff will be worth it. 

No real game-breaking faults as some have led others to believe but the game has been done better elsewhere for the most part.

A welcome addition to alea's "big box" line.  My rating has gone up after repeated plays.

While it is no Traders of Genoa or Puerto Rico, it definitely ranks higher than Eiszeit (Mammoth Hunters) and could very well become one of my favourite alea games.

Picking the right action at the right time is a key part of the game, and you will find many other brain-burning decisions have to be made as well.

I've seen complaints about the randomness of the auction cards, but because they only come in three different values the luck tends to even out over the course of a game.

Each game we've played so far has come down to last turn scoring with the winner each time taking the lead by only a few points... and each time we've played, the players wanted to play again immediately to try and "fix" what they thought they did wrong and try a different strategy.

Highly recommended... alea should have another winner!

I think the mechanics of this game are sound. The first time through you should clearly explain the scoring of the regions so that players understand the idea that they need to multiply the assigned value of different adjacent shops by the number of their skyscrapers. One skyscraper next to four different shops is 8 points. Three skyscrapers next to two shops is 9 points and so on, very important. The games of this I've played have been fairly close and definitely interesting.

I've enjoyed my playings of this game and if it was one if the first area control games I owned it'd hit the table more often. As it is it fights for play time. 

I think this game took an unfair beating when it initially came out.

I'm not sure why this has gotten trashed so much.  I entirely enjoyed my playing.  A player needs to attach himself to the tactics of his neighbors to insure that their interests are aligned because scoring requires a two-move cooperation.  In this way, it's a little like Union Pacific - in that taking a purely solo strategy won't get you far.  The bidding system - in which using higher valued cards makes your winning payoff lower - is very clever.  There are also some interesting tactics in choosing the particular plots to invest in.

Don't knock this until you've tried it.

RATING: 6
Fifth Avenue has a lot of deficits which make it one of the least popular Alea Big Boxes. It's a dry auction game, the design is drab, the card colours almost indistinguishable, it's fragile as the game might end prematurely with inexperienced players that only build shops. 
But once players get past these hindrances, there's an interesting and unique game waiting. Benefitting from partnerships and setting up the board to your profit is a challenging task. The game's core of delayed multiple auctions in a row is original although it can get exhausting. It's a bit similar to Taj Mahal that you want to be prepared for the coming auctions as well but sometimes you have to win a certain auction for the cost of spending most of your hand which dimishes your chances for the next auctions close to zero. 
Still, due to the various drawbacks and the difficulty of getting the right group to play, Fifth Avenue doesn't rise above an ok rating.

When a game takes longer to explain than to play, you know its not going to be good. For a fairly simple game, the number of rules to remember just did not make this game worthwhile.

Fifth Avenue is a bidding game about buying up buildings in New York. The number of different shops next to a building provide it with victory points. There's an interesting auction mechanism where the lower your card denomination, the more buildings you can build. 

However auctions happen at random intervals that break the flow of the game. Because an auction can take so long, its very jarring to have an auction in between turns, and then try to remember what you were planning to do before the auction. The commissioner system also feels very tacked-on, and doesn't suit the theme well.

The common gripe that the game ends prematurely due to businesses doesn't make sense, as there's no incentive to place a business until you have a more developed stake on the board. To place a business without a significant building advantage would be an awful move.

Don't play 2 player, 3 seems to be the sweet spot.

Rating is for the two player game.  I can see where if there is a full complement of four players the rating for the game would likely go up.  As it is, the game just doesn't scale well for two which involves a dummy player of sorts.  Several interesting decisions to be made which also can limit your options in a following phase.  In our game, we missed quite a few of the inner workings of the game initially and recognized that it would definitely be a better game when we played again.

After our first plays, I'm rather convinced that it is quite excellent itself, which leaves me a bit puzzled concerning the comments. Fast play, interesting decisions and ample room for interaction (= screwing over your friends  and relations) should please most gamers in spite of a lackluster theme, I would have thought.
Played 5+ times.

The game is not broken.  It works and there are possibilities for moderately clever play.  That's about it.  Nothing original, nothing exciting, even the components don't seem to be up to par (the business chips are too damn small).  I guess Alea is mortal after all.

I had very low expectations for this one and I remember I got my copy for around $5 off of ebay, brand new in shrink because its reputation was so bad.  We actually liked playing the game.

Sure this game doesn't have the most exciting theme but it's a clever auction game with some tough decisions.  Besides determining how much to pay players must also decide where to move the commissioners (which determine where the auctions take place), whether to add more buildings, enhance their buildings and where scoring should take place.  There's also plenty of defensive placement and movement decisions to think about.  I was suprised at how well this game played with two but could see that one would start losing control once more players were introduced, something I look forward to testing out soon.  Might top out at 3.  There's really nothing new here but the sum of it's parts (mechanics) somehow felt quite refreshing.

A lot to like in this tense auction quasi area control game. The mechanism that lowers the amount of buildings that can be made the higher the card value used to win the auction is unique and makes bidding tricky and deliciously painful. Did I bid enough? Or will I get too few buildings if I bid higher? Easily a great addition to the the Alea line.

I don't like games where you need to count on your opponents to help you (unless it's a game like Diplomacy) and can have no chance in a game through little or no fault of your own. I also found the gameplay to be uninteresting and the mechanics clunky.

First play, 2-player w/ a couple dropped rules.  Another play, 2-player with all correct rules and increased familiarity was more fun.  There was a lot of tension in the auctions and keeping the inspectors off the other player's more dominant blocks.  The auction is different and enjoyable.  I liked having 4 different choices of action, and it was hard to have enough skyscrapers and also enough cards to effectively bid.  We liked the auto player just fine.  This seems like it would be a lot of fun with 4 players.

The negative:  I read some reviews and comments here first, and we were careful not to take the businesses too fast.  There's just not enough businesses.  It seems like a 4-player game would find it almost impossible to earn the 4 business bonus and the businesses would run out even sooner with the increased jockeying for position.  Taking them at an advantageous, but not too fast of pace was fun...but it is kind of weird having to not use or delay use of one of the most important parts of the game to ensure it's enjoyable.  A fix that just let you play for maximum advantage, regardless of game end condition, would boost this one.  I still want to try it with more people.

This is the type of game experience where, after you play, you're wondering, what the heck just happened?  It's a bidding game, but the value of the stuff you're bidding on isn't clear at all.  Furthermore, the game progresses in such a way that you can't really set yourself up for future turns: by the time your next turn comes around, this future is already ancient history.  The ability to bid to kill districts just muddied the waters that much more.  It just seems like the ability to come up with any sort of rational strategy in this game is beyond me.

Not sure why so many people aren't hot on this game.  If it's uninventive, what the heck is Settlers of the Stone Age?  Or San Marco?  It's kind of like a more forgiving Taj Mahal, with more auctions that are less tricky (and if you lose you get your cards back).  PLUS you can time the auctions to your own benefit.  There's always a LOT to do and your tactics have to change as the game goes on.  Early game is much different from late game.  There's a lot to keep track of and a lot to think about.  On top of that, it moves pretty quickly.  Not the greatest, and very tough to teach, but an excellent game nonetheless.

A textbook example of German Game design: you know that to win you have to advance the furthest, yet to understand how to do it, you need to "look under the bonnet" to understand the mechanics of how to move along. You have the simple placement of buildings to increase the value of empty adjacent coloured plots of land. To place your skyscrapers (which multiply the value)involves bidding with matching coloured cards, with decreased skyscraper building due to higher bids. To score a district involves having the commisioner being there (El Grande style). You get vps for spreading your skyscrapers amongst various districts, when a certain number of businesses have been placed. You get vps when building has been forced to stop. Then score the viable districts at game end coupled with the revealing of value of Central Park (which feels anti-climatic so far). So interesting mechanic wise, with some look ahead strategy whilst forcing limited options on your opponents. But not for the family/social environment I often play in, shame as I long for some decent 4 player games where you can easily determine how to get from A to B.I suspect this game will play better with 3.

OK, I am slanting this game a bit higher than I normally would as I have only played one game. Normally I would wait for a few games before rating a game. But it really was a great game, and I eagerly want to play it again. I can honestly say that it doesn't play like anything else that I own. (I have never played taj mahal, though) I have a funny feeling that all the negative scores are from people who read the rules wrong. (easy to do in this game,unfortunately)

Edit: This game has stood the test of time and is always a fantastic play. (with a small bias towards a 2 player game. I think it really shines in that regard.)

Has all the hallmarks of a good Alea game, but it falls short. For me, the auctions are dull and too repetitive.

It's mechanically interesting, but fussy and convoluted. I don't have a strong grasp on the strategy, which I feel can get train wrecked by the actions of other players. We may even have had some king maker issues in one of our plays. The biggest mark against the game is the rule book, which is written in clunky 'german-style' english.

I think the game would feel better with a military theme. Where the stop markers are essentially the nuclear mushroom cloud preventing advance, and that buildings are your military strength in a region. Cest La Vie…

Place business tiles and (via auctions) skyscrapers in various districts of NYC in the 1930's. Victory points are then awarded for having the most unique types of businesses adjacent to your skyscrapers. Two commissioners are moved across the board to determine which districts can be scored in any given turn, as well as which districts may have new skyscrapers built. 2p game requires projecting moves for an "imaginary" 3rd player.....which is always a bogus way to have a game support 2 players.

I feel that perhaps my experience with this game is quite different that how others had taken it in.  First, I've only played this with two players.  In the two player game there is a large amount of control, with grueling decisions over auctions and actions.  Resources are tight especially keeping your building supply stocked up.  It is easy to get caught with your pants down so you feel like you are on the edge of getting spanked the whole time.

I would imagine in a four player game the board drastically changes by the time the game comes back around to you.  Also, I could see how it would be frustrating dealing with the over abundance of auctions vs the time it takes to get cards and buildings, but I am only projecting as the two player game doesn't suffer from this at all.

This game falls right in line with tough management games like Vino.  One of the better Alea games.

An interesting game of hand management and area control. The scoring rules tempt you with business tiles that rush the game to a too-rapid end. The auctions are sort of like Taj Mahal (specific card color, may use wild color as well, one winner, bid in turn order adding card[s] to your bid). With 4 (all of us newbies), the game seemed to move too quickly and the board changed too dramatically between your turns. Maybe this is better with 2 or 3 (or with 4 experienced players)?

There's quite a bit to think about in this fast-paced game.  Having to choose from one our four options on your turn is difficult, especially as the game progresses and you really want to do at least three of the four choices!

Perhaps the most interesting game in the entire alea series, Fifth Avenue is less Feldian and more in the Chicago Express "incentive management" mould -- it's very difficult to score points during the game unless other players let you, so the trick is to ensure that other players' actions help you.

There's some weirdness in, say, the random scoring of central park skyscapers, and in general it feels much clumsier than any of the similar designs to have come from the Winsome experts. But it's well worth a look and quite unfairly maligned.

Rules are quite poorly written and hard to grok.

The worst Alea big box game by a mile. There seems to be something wrong with the game, perhaps we were playing by the wrong rules, but I doubt it. The natural tendacy for a person to "improve" his properties cause the game to come to an abrupt end. In my group this game just doesn't work.

A definate 10 for depth of strategy, but analysis paralysis can make this game unbareable.  3-player back-side board is fun/nice, regardless that the rule book discourages it.

Tricky balancing act with some tough bidding. Seems possible to really rush the game by placing businesses. This was being a big problem in early games, but that was before...

Revised rating: wasn't liking how this played all that much, then we discovered we hadn't been playing with the explicitly 4 player board when playing with 4; enjoyed it a lot more that way.

This game seems quite underrated to me. I thought it was better than the average BGG rating here would lead me to believe. The rules bogged us down quite a bit in our first playing, but after we "got it", we really loved it. Fun stuff.

Everybody else seemed slightly more excited by Fifth Avenue than I was and we spent a little bit of time discussing it post-game. Now, a month or so later I find it hard to recall much of anything about the game which perhaps says a lot about it.

There's a semi-interesting hand management aspect going on and you want to be in a position to bid in the colours you want, when you want, but I didn't really find any reason to be overly excited.

Just doesn't grab me. Nothing prevents people from quickly putting down businesses to score themselves more points and this triggers the end of the game. With experience will this change?

I like the interesting bidding portion of this game in which the higher cards allow for fewer skyscrapers to be placed, and the lower cards allow for more.  When someone else bids you up, you have to pay more resources for fewer skyscrapers.  You really have to pick your battles in this game, which makes for nice, tense auctions.  Great game, and a worthy addition to the excellent Alea line.

A greatly disappointing offering from Alea, which until now has been a bastion of quality (Mammoth Hunters may not have been terrific, but it's certainly a solid and enjoyable game). Fifth Avenue is uninspired and dull, and has fallen flat with everyone with whom I've played.

After 3 plays I have the following observations.
1.  Tactics is everything.  What others do or don't do will destroy a set strategy.
2.  Until you have played a few games the tendency will be to use up the shop tiles too early and end the game prematurely.
3.  Over bidding in the early rounds is a killer and very difficult to overcome.
4.  The STOP building move can really slow down someone who is threatening to run away with the game.  It is a good move to help someone get back into the game.
5.  I am not sure bidding on Central Park is really worth it unless you can get it cheap.  It think the value of the Central Park scoring needs to be slightly higher to off-set the idea that you have tied up your assets for the entire game and only get to score one time.  It needs to be potentially a bigger score.  But not so big that it un-balances the game.

Saw the rating on bgg and put me in doubt of purchasing, did anyway (capitalist i hear you thinking) and it's not a bad game. Interesting gameplay, continuous threat of ending the game, whilst you would like to do so much more than you are able to. Play with all experienced or all non experienced players or else it's too chaotic.

I apparently like this game more than the average BGGer but that's OK with me. It's a neat game. Pressure to get things done before 2 building stops come out. Do you multiply your current positions or spread out for the bonus points. Very nice game.

SOLD (10/25/09) --- Just ordered this during the 50% sale at Amazon (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/125935).  I don't even own Chinatown, I don't even like Hoity Toity, and I have the cheap Uberplay version of Ra, but for some reason I still feel compelled to get games just because they are Alea.  It doesn't hurt that I'm a New York City resident, and that it works for two players.

I prefer other sorts of incentive matrix games, something about it just felt thematically trivial & awkward and there're so many games now that do these things so well, and the narrative suffered from a sort of benign nostalgia that settle like dust. So for me it's a game-churn title (tho looking backwards) rather than a spark to chase deeper.

There's nothing glaringly WRONG with the game.  But.  The subsystems hold together better than in Manz' Giganten, but not really well (the design doesn't feel tightly integrated).  And it's just not that much fun - I've played it 3 times now, and didn't enjoy it any more the 3rd time than the 1st (less, actually).

I want to like Fifth Avenue, I really do- the bidding system is clever and fun, and there's a nice dose of incentive management. But every time the experience as a whole ends up feeling wonky, and less than the sum of its parts. I'd like to play with 4, as my last few games have been with 3 and it definitely feels as if there aren't enough buildings in each player's supply (there's too many auctions too frequently for the lesser number of players). It just seems that the businesses and buildings need to come out neither too quickly nor too slowly or the game system starts to creak. With so many other games, Fifth Avenue just isn't quite intriguing enough to merit the scientific treatment that would be required to make it sing.

I'm astounded by the number of folks who dismiss this game. The auctions are incredibly tense, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around the strategy after a half-dozen plays. Each game has felt different in pace and structure, yet all of them have been tightly fought. An excellent auction/building game.

This game gives new meaning to the term "fragile". IF players are dropping down businesses right from the get go, the game will tend to end even before it starts.
RGG rules leave some big holes, (like is there a mximum number of skyscrapers you can put in a plot? ALL of the examples never show more than two). I'd like to play again though.

Played twice (with 4 players). I had heard lots of bad things about this game, and it was not that bad after all - just not really spectacular or interesting. There are some nice ideas, there is some annoying randomness too (for instance in the Central Park scoring), but overall, it feels a bit bland.

After one play, I must say that I do not agree with the criticisim I read about on the Internet. Sure, it isn't the most original of games, but it works and offers numerous ways to victory. Furthermore, it plays fast - about an hour. My first game finished in 30 minutes, though I expect this to last longer once the underlying strategies become more apperant. 

Not the best in the Alea series but a nice addition nonetheless. Ordered my copy allready.

So apparently there is a "wrong" way to play Fifth Avenue, which is to simply run out of the businesses/shops and thus ending the game prematurely.  Having to be told that specifically prior to the start certainly did not bode well for the experience.  Furthermore, I am not very fond of the fact that in order to prevent someone from scoring big, one would often need to make suboptimal choices for himself in the process of achieving that goal.  

Then there is the problem of having to sit out on neighborhood auctions because you ran out of buildings.  In our 4-player session that happened pretty much constantly.  The lack of control in this game is far too glaring to ignore, so you're often forced to take certain actions in order to stay competitive.

Lastly, the rule complexity is a major source of turn off for me.  I think the designer tried too hard to cram too much into this game.  Although there are a couple of interesting concepts, ultimately they don't work very well with each other.

There's a lot going on with Fifh Avenue, what with the comissioner movement, placement of businesses and the auctions...but it doesn't seem to mesh together very well.  Interesting stuff, but doesn't captivate me to want to play again and again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Very fast paced lightweight game about placing skyscrapers into city districts where there are different shop tiles in 1930's New York. The game allows you to take ONE of four actions, under which you must do other items. One of the commisioner piece moves which allow people to score for districts (essentially the more skyscrapers the better).  

The commissioner may also trigger an auction where players can bid using their cards on plots of land to place more skyscrapers.

I thought the pace of the game was very quick, it is easy to get left behind and the pricing of auctions can get very high.  The idea in Auctions is to bid a card with a value of Four but have your overall total be the winning bid as the cards have pictures on them pertaining to how many skyscrapers you can build.

I thought it was an reasonable good game, very quick and you can get screwed out if you are not careful.

10/30/07 - I had been wanting to try out Fifth Avenue for so long, but of course, the bad reviews kept potential co-players at bay.  Well, I finally had my chance, and found the game to be quite to my liking.  Though the theme seems pretty non-nonsensical (the value of a high-rise is determined by whether or not it's built near a jewelry shop?!?), I found the game-play really fascinating.

Such a simple design, with what seems like a lot going on, yet really, can be grasped rather quickly. The added design elements of the various national parks, imagery, and booklet with information on them make this a family favorite.

It's similar to Ticket to Ride minus the trains so it's a different theme.. It's a great gateway game easy to like and explain and comes with a beautiful book showing the National Parks of the USA with what to see / visit while travelling.

Kickstarter. We really enjoy it. Unlike Ticket to Ride, when the colors you need to claim parks aren't coming up, you can instead move around to strategically grab stones to try to score points at the end. Good artwork & implementation.

This is a great gateway game. I've really been enjoying introducing it to new and light-weight gamers, as well as to kids with some gaming experience. It's easy to play and a lot of fun. I enjoy the point-to-point movement aspect, and the theme is so accessible. When playing with people who I know would appreciate lighter-weight games, Trekking the National Parks has become the first game I grab.

I have not yet played with more serious gamers but hope to get my gaming group to play it sometime soon.

Yes, I’m a National Park ranger and fan, but this is a solid gateway game. Components are excellent. The National Park booklet is very good. Gameplay is set collection of National Park trekking cards, locations, and crystals for visiting parks. Theme works well for gameplay. Like It much better than any Ticket to Ride series. Way more thematic. Highly recommended for a family game.

Update 2/4/18 Everyone in the family is really enjoying this game and requesting it. We played it 3 times in one day. Gameplay is simplified but decisions can be quite strategic. They knocked this game out of the parks!

Fun game, but lite.  Several possible strategies (park tickets, stones, postcards) - seems that winners go after two of those.  Going after all three seems to be too much to do during the game, and only one doesn't give enough points.

On the surface this looks like a simple set collection game like Ticket to Ride - collect the right cards, move around the country, pick up stones, and when possible claim a National Park card. It definitely has more strategy than you might expect, and it was fun to play.

This would be a great game to play with kids to teach them about America's national parks.  Also would make a good gateway game for new gamers.  Top-notch components.

Up to six players compete in a cross country race to visit the National Parks and collect the most points. Gathering colored trek cards allows players to move across the map and claim valuable park cards. If a player is the first to visit a National Park, they collect that park's colored stone, which award bonus points at the end of the game.

First of all, I LOVE National Parks (have visited over 100 sites in the NPS system), but I have to admit that I was reluctant to shell out $60 for a game at an NPS gift shop, because I was worried it would be really lame. In fact, it's pretty good. It has a lot of Ticket to Ride aspects to it, but adds in a few more elements, so there are actually more options for scoring points than Ticket to Ride. Plus, it's a cool way to teach kids about the National Parks.

This game can get pretty mean for a family game by players running to a spot someone else is headed to and just sitting on it till they draw the right cards. It does have more in depth game play then any other parks game I know. I think it just needs a few tweaks to be a good game. Maybe pull in another game designer for ideas.

This is a game that comes from a place of love.  You can tell that the creator has a passion for visiting and trekking through the national parks, as the game comes with a guidebook for visiting all these parks.  Similar to Ticket to Ride with just an ounce more depth makes this a great gateway game.

Love this game. If you love of Ticket to Ride, you will surely love Trekking the National Parks. It's easy to learn, even for the novice board game player. More variety of destinations and more decisions to be made with your hand card play. Many ways to gain points with park cards and stone collections. Many levels of strategy to block your opponents and gain the upper hand. Wonderfully written Park Guide Book with great insight to all the parks from the writer's personal experiences and personal photos. A go to game when friends gather at our house.

One of my favorite family games at the moment. Easily replaces ticket to ride. Gorgeous production value super quick to teach and get started and not too long. 

My one preliminary word of caution is there may be too much incentive to collect stones at the expense of other point-generating actions. . . only more plays will tell for aure.

Fun game that does a good job of being suitable (and playable) by young gamers, without insulting the intelligence of experienced adults.  I've also put it to good use wth my Cub Scouts as a way of teaching them where a lot of our major parks are (without them realizing they were learning something).

This has replaced vanilla Ticket to Ride for me. Better art and a way better theme. Easier to explain than TTR and you don't completely suck on your first game. The thing about TTR that this fixes is that you don't just sit and draw train cards for the first several turns. This game rewards the first player to arrive at locations. The artwork and photography are inviting, and I actually feel like I am a traveller moving around. TTR has an awful premise for how the game plays (if I'm a traveler trying to get the most trips a la Phineas Fogg, why can I go from anywhere to anywhere? Where am I?) and this game totally nails it where TTR failed. Component quality is great. Just a little sad my home state of Iowa is so scrunched up but it makes total sense when you compare the parks' locations. Even comes with a little "expansion" that I can't wait to try. I'm proud to own this gem!

A beautifully produced game, big blocky hikers, solid stones, and compelling decisions.  There's even some education here that will have you appreciating the National Parks.  Scores are pretty tight and the tension seems to last to the end!  A top family game!

[2016.Jul.11] A family-friendly game that plays quickly and works surprisingly well with young gamers. The big, chunky bits work well with both young and old hands alike. For veteran gamers, there isn't anything new or miraculous here, other than a solid gateway game. Having more paths to victory, when compared to other gateway games like Ticket to Ride, is a solid plus. The game's topic does a good job of introducing Park newbies to some scenic U.S. National Parks.

As of 27 November 2016, I've played this game 4 times and enjoy it more each time.  I rarely play a game even twice, so playing a game 4 or more times is the best endorsement I can give.  This would be an excellent family game, school or library game, or game for casual gamers, while still being entertaining to hobby gamers.  It would be an EXCELLENT gateway game.

I have now played this game multiple times with different players and the game seems to be consistently well received.  My most recent game played differently than any previous game, and highlighted the variation in how people attempt to win.  There are some who love the game and always want to play it.

I always play with the Postcard option, and this makes the game much stronger because it gives players another alternative to winning.  

My only criticism of the game is the all or nothing approach to stones.  I would like to see a rule that gives a player 1 point for each different colored stone that they collect, as this would give an incentive for grabbing stones rather than just leaving them for the players who have chosen to try to win by collecting stones.  As it is, there is no incentive for many players to go after any stones once they realize that they cannot win the most of a color except for blocking other players from getting the majority. Of course, the players going for stones are always risking the possibility that they won't succeed it getting the majority.

Trekking the National Parks is a quick and simple game of set collection and strategic movement in the same vein as Ticket to Ride. Each player is competing to visit the most (and most prestigious) national parks all across the US. They do so by collecting sets of cards in of various flavors, such as forests, canoes, hiking boots, etc., that they use to travel from one park to another and to collect the quintessential national park experience (victory points). 

Though the gameplay is simple and not terribly complex, the inspiring theme, gorgeous imagery, and superb production quality make for a quick and entertaining game.

RATING: 4
(+) Nice components (big player pawns, big map, colorful 'gems', nice manual with information on all the national parks)
(+) The end-game offers some interesting moments when options are running out
(+) Easy to learn, easy and quick to play
(+) I love the theme of national parks

(-) Very uninspired, boring and repetitive set collection mechanic: set with trekking-card numbers in order to move and perform set collection of gems - which continues with set collection with trekking-card icons in order to perform set-collection with NP-cards. The game is too easy, straightforward and linear
(-) Unbalanced scoring mechanism: collecting gems is much easier and more straight forward compared to collection national park cards and offers to many points in comparison
(-) Art used on trekking cards falls short in comparison with the rest of the artwork
(-) Considerable randomness in the way the different cards come out. The outcome is a result of 75% luck and only 25% skill.

Tips:
(*) For more balanced scoring, it would be advisable to lower the value of bonus cards for majorities at the end of the game to 2 points in stead of 5 points
(*) At the start of the game: head to an area containing multiples of the same gem color as soon as possible and collect those first in order to guarantee majority. Later on, look for specific numbers or icons you need in the trekking cards display: if there are interesting cards, take them - otherwise move or take a National Parks card.

The design of "Trekking" owes a lot to Ticket to Ride, but it fixes several issues that tend to bog the base version of the latter down; Trekking's equivalent to Ticket to Ride's tickets are claimed from a market once a player meets the requirements to score them, eliminating the issue of being locked into a route that either provides few points or is impossible to complete. The board is remixed each game by the placement of the collectible colored stones, eliminating the issue of making the long Western routes and tickets the be-all-end-all for scoring. Also, Trekking's multi-function cards result in far fewer "dead" turns where all you can do is draw cards that you have no use for. It's fun, fast, light enough to teach to anyone, but has enough teeth to not bore hardcore gamers. Great game.

RATING: 6.1
Game play is very simplistic: each turn players take any 2 of 3 possible actins: move, draw card, claim a park card.  Victory points are scored by picking up colored stones along the paths and claiming park cards.  Educational game of sorts in that you can learn the names and locations of the national parks.  More of a simple fun family game than anything strategic or meatie.

Created a solo variant. Kept it simple and followed regular rules as much as possible. Tweaked mechanics first couple of plays. Deal 3 park cards face-up; 5 trek cards face-up; 5 trek cards to Human player. AI does not use trek cards. Human Player goes first and takes 2 actions (move, draw, claim park card) as normal. AI takes top Park Card from face-down stack and must roll "higher" than value to claim. Move AI to park location and claim stone only if it wins the card. Game ends when Human claims 5 park cards or AI claims 10, whichever comes first, but Human player always gets last play. Scoring: Human Player adds up value of claimed Park Cards, plus +5 for most stones of each color. AI adds up value of claimed Park Cards and subtracts 1/2 value of Park Cards not won, plus +5 for most stones of each color. Human player must keep track of AI stone totals and claim extra stones whenever possible instead of sitting idle drawing cards.

This game is fun to play and easy to learn.  The style is somewhat like TTR and would be a nice game for non-gamers.  The colors are nice and distinct and include icons which is important because my SO is colorblind.  The graphics are nice and the meeples are enormous!  The guidebook was not interesting when I first looked at the game but when I got it I sat and read every page; it was a very nice addition. 

We got in some play as a warm up game and it was great.  Some of the parks were hard to find on the game board which I attribute to two things 1) the US is skewed to more evenly distribute the parks that are close together or where they are far apart, and 2) we need to travel more!  

I got the game from kickstarter.  It was delivered on time (!) and they posted nice updates.  

Edit: removed a section on a replacement meeple, it was not in the package.

I wasn't expecting a lot of control, but there was even less than I expected. The rule about not being able to move on or through another player seems problematic; there's nothing stopping someone from just camping on an active park until they get the cards needed to claim it, and that in fact seems to be a good strategy. Boring.

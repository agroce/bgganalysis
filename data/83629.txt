The game is quite attractive and the rules read pretty smoothly with only a little ambiguity. You follow Bilbo's journey with the company of dwarves as they go to reclaim their home of the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. The mechanics aren't complicated and you get them down by halfway through your first game. This is nice because then you can concentrate on strategies and tactics quickly. I like all the optional rules and particularly the semi-cooperative one where everyone loses if Smaug reaches Laketown. There's a nice combination of card hand management for events and some dice rolling to resolve adventures (which isn't often in a Knizia game). The game fits two niches: a really good family game and an excellent light/filler game for more advanced Tolkien loving gamers.

Too bad it's made in China, I got the FF version due to the text on cards, but the board doesn't fit properly into the insert. The surface has that Chinese feel. 
I prefer to pay a bit extra, have a better quality product and NOT have all the worlds money going to China!

The first near-medium weight game from Knizia in a couple of years is this forgettable game.  Seems like [b]Beowulf[/b] or [b]Lord of the Rings[/b]-lite.  Kinda long for a family game.  Too boring for gamers.  Meh.

[ESP] Es un poco extraño lo que siento por este juego. Me entretuve mucho jugándolo pero la dependencia de la suerte está por todos lados. 
Creo que siempre dará un buen rato pero dado el factor suerte no lo jugaría muy seguido. A eso debe la baja nota (ya que está de acuerdo a la calificación de BGG)

RATING: 4.5
So-so game with the Hobbit Theme tacked on - not very well in my opinion. Published merely as a money maker for Fantasy Flight and Knizia. Fantasy flight seems to be skimping on the components, especially the boards and boxes. I was GENTLY back-folding the board when "Hey, how do you do", it snapped clean in half! I never had that happen before, ever!

Let's face it, I'm a sucker for any Tolkien based game. I am also a sucker for any game that my girlfriends 11 year old can play and enjoy and beat me on a regular basis. Well, the Hobbit fits all of these criteria. Although the mechanics don't completely fit the theme (I know it's a retheme of an earlier RK game), it is just fun. There is a lot of tension as you have to decide if you want to pass the current challenge and let you opponent attempt it. Great game, highlt recommended.

First reaction = "Meh."  Not really good, not really bad.  Somewhat entertaining, but why would we reach for this again when there are FAR better games sitting right next to it?

We love Knizia's coop game The Lord of the Rings and this board looks somewhat similar which is a big reason why we purchased it. Big let down.

RATING: 6
Rating very tentative. In my only play, played with the 1 per stat start, 4 players. In the first adventure, I lost the first one, lost 2 food, and watched the rest of the time. Everyone else tried every adventure, lost almost all of them, and Smaug ended up 2 spaces away from Laketown. He got there very quickly in adventure #2, and the game ended very early. I guess the game is sort of fragile? If people don't pass strategically, the game will end very early, and kind of be a dud. I really want to try again, with people who dont have a bad initial taste.

A fun little family game with some character development, some tastes of the adventures from the book and generally some fun.  Will require a tweak or two I think to play the way I want - a mix of the old and the new rules I think.  But by and large a good solid game for the family.  There are some neat choices to be found, but it is not complex enough to cause difficulties when playing in a family atmosphere - I like it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Dull gameplay. Badly applied theme - suckered in by the title and great artwork. Rubbish scoring mechanisms. Would only play again with kids who enjoyed the book/film, provided they were able to cope with the pseudo-co-op victory conditions.

One of two Tolkien games I disliked so much I've sold it on. Despite, even, it's absolutely fantastic artwork. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty long for such a light game, and very heavy on luck when it comes to guessing what cards to play.   Theme also seems very pasted on, which is a little surprising for a game that you'd expect to be deeply thematic.  At no point did I feel like i was on Bilbo's adventure.

Initial rating a 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
This could only be satisfying if looked at as a kid's game. Challenges are too easy to defeat and losing them is not punishing enough when you can't. Also, always giving priority to the player with highest initiative is a bad mechanic and can cause a runaway leader problem. Ultimately, however, the biggest problem is that the game is just boring: I actually liked Knizia's LOTR game, but this one's a dud.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The obvious comparison to make is with the Lord of the Rings - again you proceed along a track and the graphics and presentation are lovely - but the mechanics are rather different and this is much simpler and easier to win.  We found it enjoyable as a 'light' game and there are some nice touches but this is much more a family game than one for gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a lighter Knizia - definitely lighter than his recent big winners for me like Beowulf or Blue Moon City - but I enjoyed it still. As is so often the case with his stuff, there is more depth to the decisions than is immediately apparent, it moves fast and with good tension, it's got good narrative arc, and although not as thematic as Beowulf or Lord of the Rings, is still quite well-themed.

Like a lot of Knizia games, The Hobbit is hard to pigeon-hole. The journeying element has sort of a "fast auction" feel to it, while the adventures are a simple but quite effective dice game and has his more traditional feel of managing risk. It's probably ultimately a little random for the more serious hobbyist, but for those of us who like Knizia's more artful design streak, with his mastery of narrative tension and ingenious approach to theming, this will find fans. It also has potential to fall into the thin category of true gateway-type games, with its ease of teaching, appealing theme, and yet with many artful elements of more sophisticated games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While I generally dislike games that are heavy on the "blind bid where you guess what everyone else is going to play" mechanic, this one is light enough where I really didn't mind.

There's also some fun dice rolling here, which I usually enjoy, and it was incorporated pretty well into this game.

Overall, a fun, light, super-filler that will likely work very well for families, yet keep gamers fairly interested.

Argh I don't know. I played one play where we got 1/3 of the way before we gave up. Then I decided to try again tonight after a few beers and I had a blast. I think it was partly because Heather was into it and we were trash talking etc. I am suspicious about how many really decisions I had during the game however hence the low score.

Technically there will be a single winner, but if you don't cooperate along the way, you aren't likely to get past Smaug for anyone to even have a chance.  I like the game, but cooperating to compete sort of feels weird outside of Munchkin.

Blind bidding for the movement track rewards and dice rolling for encounters. Works well enough but is too similar to Knizia's Beowulf and LotR and feels quite abstract to me. 

One play: Whole party defeated due to complete lack of shield rolls in the encounters. I was happy to see Smaug reach Laketown as my stats were completely rubbish and I was going to lose anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun adaptation of The Hobbit suitable for children and adults alike. Best played as a semi co-op: if Smaug gets to Laketown before the party reaches the Lonely Mountain, all players lose! We play this often with our 5-year-old.
Can play 2-players.
Best with 3 players.

Take this for what its worth.  This isn't a game you're going to play every week with your group or family.  Pull it out a few times every year and it's fine.  You can't play time after time because you'll rip your scalp off the repetitive nature of the game.  But once in awhile is just fine.  It does evoke the travels of Thorin and company on their way to the Lonely Mountain.  An enjoyable family game with a solid Hobbit theme.

Not bad.  Better than the older edition, I think.  I will probably play this a number of times with the kids, then get rid of it.  Probably not worth getting unless you have some younger age (8-10) kids who like fantasy.  Maybe casual gamers would also like it.

If you're a real fan of the hobbit, this game is great. Lots of quotes from the novel and some great artwork. Game play itself is boring to me. 

There are not enough gems provided with the game in order to complete it, which really pisses me off. Every single game we run out of gems and have to supplement with Niagara gems. Very irritating in a game like this.

Great for the kid, or for serious Hobbit fans.

This game is a great introduction to some of the themes used in Reiner Knizia's Lord of the Rings game, but understandable for kids and people who like lighter games. The game play is fitting for the Hobbit storyline. The game is competitive, but if the players don't cooperate enough, the dragon wins and all of the players loose. The events happen randomly instead of in the order that they occur in the book, but help tie the game to the book. It is a great game to play when you don't have time to play Lord of the Rings.

An easy to play, well designed game that's great fun when you don't feel like giving a long rules explanation and you  just want everyone to get into it right away. A story game where you build up your character and go on adventures with dice rolling and hidden card play. This feels like a gateway game, but since it's Knizia it has that extra something that makes it unique and involving for everyone.

RATING: 4
Played this 4 player last night in our Thursday group. We started with all attributes as zero (hard core) and still found the a lot of encounters to be achievable even to the extent that we almost ran out of gems (if I had rolled 1 shield on 10 dice then we would have done so!).
The big problem was with the variability of the rewards available for the encounters. In the first two phases I took a lead as I had been 'spoofing' well and got to complete plenty of encounters. Phase 3 gave me only 1 (one) encounter to attempt and it paid off 1 gem and all I could do was watch others get 2-4 for each of 2 attempted!
Same on the last phase - I get one cheap encounter that I breeze through and although I got unlucky on a 4 point encounter but the game was over for me due to randomness already.
It was quite a fast paced game but would I play it again when there are so many better ways of filling 45-60 minutes?

A couple PROS first:
The game looks great. Good artwork, good components, including the "jewels" (however, we usually run out of jewels by the end of the game).
Smaug's creep toward Laketown and the possession of the Ring are decent thematic elements.

CONS:
There is a major luck element, which many times, I don't mind. However, in this case, a little misfortune at the beginning of the game can lead to a "rich-get-richer, poor-get-poorer" syndrome. And usually, I am on the rich side of things, but that sucks the fun out of the game.
Also, the method of blind bidding becomes uninteresting.
Finally, I feel the game lacks "replayability", mainly due to the fact that after you play once, you have seen every single card in the game, and WILL see every single card in virtually the same order the next time you play.

Despite its shortcomings, I still feel it is slightly better than average. My wife does enjoy it a little more than I do, which is why it will stay, maybe until some better games force it out of our storage space.

RATING: 7.5
Dwarf cards are a bit fiddlly - used a subset of 6-nimmt cards. (Wonder if just using the full set would affect the game.) And as pointed out on the forum, no point actually doling out gems when you can just keep the adventure cards as IOUs.

Have printed out the Thorin's Companions variant cards - tried them once, but I chose a complete duffer and got very little benefit from him.

What I liked:
* Simple game, I liked how the fact that you didn't necessarily need the highest or lowest cards for most bids as it was dependant on what you were going after but you didn't know if others were going after it aswell.

What I didn't like:
* I didn't like how the quests were done.
* Dragon did not even come remotely close to reaching the town so there was no tension there.
* Gems ran out in both games

Players are dwarves accompanying Bilbo to the Lonely Mountain.  Players use cards to determine the order in which Bilbo moves along a path of spaces, that earn the mover stuff to develop their character.  They can increase initiative, cunning, strength and provisions, which are used during adventures - which occur at four times during the game.  Completing adventures means rolling dice against a target, and adding their character development to the result - success pays off in treasure, failure means a visit from Smaug and some damage.  Nice light game that is a real mixing pot of different Knizia games - and of course it works well.  Aimed at casual gamers - the blind bidding for Bilbo movement may put the "serious" gamers off.  Second and third games have improved ... excellent game, looks beautiful too.

Right out of the gate first play rating is a 5.  This is Candyland meets Relationship Tightrope meets Yahtzee.  I can't believe this is Knizia.  I highly regard LotR as one of my favorite games of all time.  

When purchased, I hoped it wouldn't be as bad as Knizia's Marco Polo.  It's worse design-wise, I think.  But maybe more fun than the ultra dry Marco Polo.

Perhaps in further plays I will find a better game.  Right now, it's a disaster.  A fun disaster (laughs about how silly it is) but a disaster no less.  Maybe there's a better game here than I first witnessed.

Maybe not bad for total filler, but it's a little long to be filler.

Not a bad light to mid weight Knizia game.  The theme is well intengrated and provides a strong sense of progression through the story.  The rules could have been a lot tighter and better organized.  We had at least 10 questions that popped up during our first game.  Most of them were ultimately answered by the rules (once we discovered where the relevant sentence was imbedded) but some relied on house rules or logic.  A final gripe is that there are not enough gems.  We consistently run out in our games. Minor gripes aside, this is a pretty good game. Between this an Beowulf, it's a toss up.  This feels a tad lighter and easier to get to the table, but I think I like Beowulf a bit better.

RATING: 8
Look, I know this game isn't that complicated and there's a ton of luck involved, but hey ... I like it.  It's quick, it's easy and it's fun.  Probably the best Hobbit themed game I've ever played.  Not really saying much since I haven't played many but still.

We played 2-Player (me and my wife) and enjoyed the theme, artistry and simple mechanics.  Very approachable and a lovely romp ... much like the book itself come to think of it.  ;oP

Perfectly passable gateway game for children, but doesn't offer enough for the more hardcore gamer. Some interesting push your luck mechanisms that are reminicient of Beowulf-class of games. Unfortunately, it's games like this that earns Knizia the reputation of making dry mathematical exercises with pasted-on themes. At no point did it feel like I was playing The Hobbit despite all the excellent artwork. Still, might bust it out when non-gamer inclined kids show up at game night.

It is not a bad game. It is light but it has different mechanics,so playing is varied. A lot of dice rolling, but while you are playing, you have the opportunity to control randomnes by auctions. It reminds me the "elder sign", when a die roll can make you win or loose, and the expectation that this produces. Then you think why you didn't increase a different skill. The game seems very repetitive but in my opinion several plays are allowed. I would recommended it for non-hardcore-players

As is quite typical for Knizia in recent times, The Hobbit is a hodgepodge of previous Knizia games (Beowulf, Sushizock, and..., Turn the Tide? Hm.). Unfortunately, but also not totally unlike his other recent efforts the result is somewhat less than stellar, even when considering the non-gamer target audience. Especially considering that target audience, in fact, because there are some unexpectedly rough edges.

The dice rolling is uninspired. The game is highly dependent on the card draws, with mid-level cards being next to useless. And the food requirements for taking part in an adventure, while Knizia-like quirky (Knirky?), introduce an exclusionary aspect that seems oddly out of place in a family game.

I want to like it, but after one play, I am a bit underwhelmed. The game seems to play you rather than you play it.  The rules have gaps and should have been written clearer. There are not enough jewels in the game so you run out. Definitely not a gamers game, more family. Theme is weak, but does save the game. Will probably play again as a family game, but it just seemed a bit clunky (May 2013: rating 5). UPDATE: Ok, I maybe wrong. Not a gamers game, but an ok BGG solo variant, and the handicap approach makes if good with kids - increase rating to 6 (May 2013). UPDATE: Still an ok family expereince, would not play thou with serious gamers (6.704, Aug16)

This type of cooperative game, a group of players advancing or carrying forward a certain hero, object, or vehicle, could be adapted to a theme such as Jules Verne's "From the Earth to the Moon", with the player characters moving the projectile toward and around the moon and back to earth (or not).

[b][i]The Hobbit[/i][/b] game, like the book, is a light-hearted jaunt through Middle-Earth. It's a relaxing game involving limited strategy best played among families. It is fun and feels true to the theme, but don't expect an intense brain burning war game (to say the least).

RATING: 7.5
Lighter Knizia-style strategy game based upon The Hobbit.  Very similar mechanically to Knizia's classic Lord of the Rings board game (with a little more theme in fact) though somewhat more basic in design.  Still, there is a fair amount of resource management and push-your-luck strategy here, and the card auction and adventure dice mechanics offer some randomness to consider (which I personally like).  Although this is semi-cooperative, my family will probably play this as a fully cooperative game (i.e. hand face up).  I particularly recommend this one for teaching young ones who like The Hobbit book and movies.

First of all, forget about the semi-coop variant when you play it with 2: it simply doesn’t work at all (there almost aren’t enough bread tokens, so it will almost always end with the defeat of both players).

Otherwise: a little bit repetitive often uncontrollable  and not that thrilling. 

It works -the system reminds me a bit of “Relationship Tightrope” (you play numbered cards and try “outguess” you opponent by playing either higher or lower than them according to the situation)- and is not too long, but if you looking for an easy “adventure” game, I would rather recommend Knizia’s Beowulf the legend (of which I actually hoped The Hobbit would be some sort of follow-up) or Tal der Abenteuer.

RATING: 6
Fun to play, but with blind bidding and dice rolling as the main mechanics, plus luck of the draw, the game is very random.

Puntuación de 7 tras la partida inicial:

El Hobbit demuestra que cuando knizia quiere sigue haciendo grandes juegos. Es un juego mas ligero que Beowulf (el otro Beowulf, ese que no está publicado en Español y tiene un tablero en forma de Ele), que a su vez era una implementación del señor de los anillos pero convirtiendo el juego cooperativo en algo competitivo ya que solo puede ganar un jugador. El Hobbit hereda el desarrollo y lo simplifica el a través de las mecánicas  de tal manera que le convierten en un juego accesible para jugadores ocasionales y para jugones que les gusten las mecánicas que implementa: subasta ciega y exprime tu suerte.

En el juego somos enanos que acompañamos a Bilbo en su épica aventura contra el dragón Smaug, durante ese camino pasaremos eventos y aventuras en 4 fases hasta que el juego termine. 

El juego esta dividido en 4 partes o capítulos, a su vez estas partes tienen dos fases, en la primera pasan eventos que hacen que aumenten nuestras habilidades Enanas y que recogamos provisiones, esta parte se resuelve mediante subastas ciegas, cada jugador tiene 5 cartas numeradas del 1 al 60 y dependiendo del evento tendremos que apostar a por la mas baja, la mas alta o intentar quedarnos en el medio.

La segunda parte es la fase de aventuras, donde por turno se van sacando cartas y si se cumplen los objetivos ganamos gemas, para ello se utilizan 5 dados y mecánicas típicas de los juegos de exprime tu suerte.

El jugador que tenga mas gemas al final de la partida gana.

Knizia ha juntado dos mecánicas de forma elegante y hace funcionar el juego como un reloj a través de un gran arco narrativo, aunque el resultado final es que tiene menos narración y es mas seco si lo comparamos con El señor de los anillos y Beowulf juegos que le superan en inmersión en la historia y en narración.

Un juego de continuas decisiones, todas ligeras, pero de constante toma de decisiones, lo que crea tensión y momentos épicos sobre todo con algunas tiradas de dados como así nos pasó, los uyyyyy, Arghhhhh, cachisssss, se escuchan continuamente.

PL: Zagrałem w tę planszówkę po ukazaniu się ostatniego filmu z serii Hobbit i, szczerze powiedziawszy, liczyłem na coś znacznie lepszego. Gra, nawet w najtrudniejszym wariancie jest tak prosta, że bez większego trudu można ją ukończyć bez jakiejkolwiek porażki (ruchu smoka). Niektóre misje można przejść bez rzutu jakąkolwiek kostką - a w zestawie jest ich 5 czy 6. Akcje są dość monotonne i często się powtarzają. Wykonanie - OK. Figurki mogłyby być lepiej wykonane. W ogólnej ocenie uwzględniona jest też cena gry - zupełnie nieadekwatna do jakości rozgrywki.

Despite some poor reviews I found this reasonably fun as a light, family game. Certainly not as good as the Knizia LOTR game but has some slight similarities.

Good for 3 players. Works alright with 2 players.

I almost didn't buy this because (frankly) it didn't look like much and I was worried about being suckered by the Knizia-LOTR combo. It turns out there is more here than meets the eye. The bidding cards fuel the game, giving players an interesting blend of decisions. However, the theme doesn't come across well and gameplay is a bit dry. This is a novel approach, but it lost its flair after a couple of plays.

I enjoy The Hobbit quite a bit. Instead of rolling dice you play dwarf cards by value to move the Bilbo marker across Middle Earth towards The Misty Mountain. Whoever throws the lowest card moves Bilbo one and collects whatever bonus, or negative that is on the space. The next lowest moves one and collects the bonus and so on. You use your stats to win challenges and collect treasure at regular intervals along the board. The point is to get Bilbo to the end. The Smaug marker starts at the Misty Mountain. Tokens can be pulled that move Smaug forward when bad decisions are made and if he reaches Lake Town the game is prematurely over. Whoever has the most treasure at the end of the game is the winner. Very simple, enjoyable rules that make for a good time every time.

For a game intended for family play The Hobbit has an astonishing runaway loser problem. A few unlucky results on the event track leading to skill loss, followed by failed adventures leading to further losses - there you are trailing others helplessly. At this time, the optional cooperative variant will be perverted, when the trailing player(s) choose(s) to work towards doom for all players.
I usually don't play with children with whom it might be fun due to the uncomplicated gameplay combined with an attitude where schadenfreude is more important than having relevant choices. For me, there's no reason to play this again when I could play Knizia's LOTR cooperative game or Beowulf to get a similar but more satisfying adventure fix.

Got this as a family game alternative to Monopoly (the best way to start a family brawl if there ever was one). While a million times better than Monopoly, replay lacks.

Not bad, but not having read The Hobbit (or being a Tokien fan), I'm sure a lot of the appeal is lost on me.

I look forward to playing this with my kids, at which point I will probably reevaluate.

RATING: 7.2
A nice family game with a card game mechanism that plays like some previous Knizia games (Relationship Tightrope/Yin Yang, Hennen Rennen) and a dice game with 5 special dice. Is in many ways a family-friendly prequel to the Lord of the Rings game just as the book is a family-friendly prequel to the trilogy. Also while a game about the fellowship's journey had to be about cooperation, here we're talking about dwarves so it is more than fitting that the game isn't really cooperative.

Easy rules and easy to get into. The theme fits well with the gameplay - something to look to when you're looking for a filler or a night with more casual (or tired) players. Love the little tidbits and the Devir version with the minis painted.

Had fun playing but I am not convinced there is much control in this game!  Random draw of power cards lead to mixed results in the blind bidding and the range of 1-60 in these cards seem ridiculous.  Dice mechanic isn't new but was enjoyable enough. Ran out of gems too?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It has an interesting narrative arc and the hidden card selection introduces some tension, but if you get way behind it can be difficult to catch up. The skills don't quite work as smoothly as I would like and there may be the temptation for a player who can't win to accept challenges that will bring Smaug closer to tank the game.
I could be persuaded to play it on occasions though.

RATING: 6
Having the joint los3 condition of Smaug sacking Laketown adds something to what would otherwise be a pretty light blind bid & dice-fest.  Theme isn't that convincing, but the mechanics are easy enough to get the hang of, and if played fully cooperative, it'd definitely be a fun way to introduce younger gamers to Knizia.

Rating as a family/kids game.  An EXCELLENT family/kids game!  My seven-year old son and daughter love this game!  We have played many times, every one fun. 

The Hobbit is a better game than some comments indicate.  While it's true that the game centers around blind/simultaneous auctions and simple dice/risk management, the system works nicely.  It's surprising how my kids love the "story" they find in the game... I wouldn't think the mechanics present any theme but they they certainly work for the children.  

Works nicely with 2, 3, 4 and 5 players.  We like the "cooperative" version, where all lose if Smaug destroys Laketown.

It's a decent family game. It is simple enough that young kids can follow and have fun rolling the dice. It does have some strategy (calculating the risks of taking an adventure, or playing the right dwarf card at the right time) but it does get repetitive after a while. Smaug is barely relevant as most of the time, you will succeed the adventures (he never made it to Laketown in our games).

Did we actually just play a game? Did something happen. The game is awful pretty, but exceedingly simple and lacks any real depth. Little to no strategy is required, just roll dice, and place cards. About the most challenging thing in the game is whether or not pass or fight the monster at the adventure locations and being able to discuss with the other players, doesn't make this much of one. I felt unengaged with either the game or the players other than admiring the artwork and the little bit of flavor fluff.

We had a lot of fun with this one. It is interesting that if you put in into direct comparison with Lord of the Rings by Dr. Knizia, this game addresses some issues with that particular game (mainly that you get trounced on the road constantly in LOTR and there are no singular events that define each area like the do in Hobbit). It did dawn on my that the end adventures did have the same structure as the endgame of The Hobbit-The Defeat of Smaug (rolling a d20 against the number of treasures collected). Mixing in a bit of Knizia's Beowulf-The Legend, too. Its a bit derivative overall, but we still had fun with it.

This is pretty awful. It almost feels like Reiner Knizia took the leftovers from making Lord of the Rings and Beowulf, and slapped them together to make this game. It shares a lot of similar mechanisms, but I was far less interested in what went on here. The game is mostly pre-programmed to play out the same way, and there's almost no room for creative play. It reminded me a lot of For Sale, where you blind bid on the properties, but ultimately it ended up feeling like a pretty basic dice-chucker. Sadly, this is one of Knizia's worst games I've ever played.

It's a typical Knizia game. Purely abstract with a clumsy themathic disguise that won't fool anybody. The gamplay seems inspired in [thing=432]6 nimmt![/thing], but it's more random and it has a bit of engine building. Nonetheless, points are distributed afterwards depending on random cards and random rolls.

So, I think it's fair to say that the game is very random, almost a luck fest that gives you the illusion of having some control, but this control depends on some atributes gained previously by random events, so...

It's a big pass for me.

It works just fine as a kids game for 8 and up, not sure I'd worry too much about bringing it out with the gamers. There's 4 stages. Each stage is made up of a series of blind revelations to determine what resources you get (lowest will get this, next lowest will get that, etc). At the end of that stage, a series of "adventures" begin where a card gets flipped stating you need x of this and y of that. You roll dice and supplement with the resources you acquired to date. Failure means a random loss of resources as per a tile flip and the next player has a shot at it instead. At least the blind revelation steps are fast (though necessarily pretty random) which means most of the game is the fun dice rolling bit. Each success here earns you jewels and most jewels win. Except, in a seemingly odd design choice, the game also ends with everyone losing if there are too many dice rolling adventure failures. Meaning anyone not in contention for the win should aim to pass on every adventure, hoping the others fail, in an attempt to collectively have everyone lose. It comes down to your reason for playing I guess. Anyway, it's fun enough with the kids and that's all I was looking for.

Rating based on one two-person game with my son. I bought this to play with the kids, and played it today with my youngest. I think the game might be more interesting with more players, but as a two-player game it didn't even hold my son's attention, let alone mine. I'll try it again later on with the three boys and see how it goes.

Fun as a pre-cursor to the big Lord of the Rings cooperative.  Plays quickly.  The theme works really well in the individual events/turns, but doesn't hold up playing the big picture.  Others have said the game is too easy.  It seemed too easy with 2 players, but when all 5 players were in the game, we got creamed (playing with the optional rule that defeat happens when Smaug reaches Laketown).

It's OK to play, but you have so little control over the course of the game, that I don't need to replay it again. The Ring also seems a bit too powerfull and with only 1 chance to get it during a travel to a certain location, also on this point is luck that will decide who will get it.

A gamme that isn't sure what it wants to be, a competetive race, a semi-coop, bah. Stay away. Unbalanced gameplay (blind bidding), poor manual, lacking a lot of crucial explanations, card randomness, not many decisions to made, and then elder-sign like yahtzee rolling. Too long, too boring.

Seems to be a nice family game and probably best suited for around 3 players or so.  A 5 player game seemed too easy as every adventure was passed and Smaug barely moved.  As a result, the game felt more like a result of random adventure draws.  With fewer players, I can see a strategic element to passing on adventures hoping to capture more gems while forcing others to perhaps take the smaller ones to hold back Smaug

RATING: 7
Update: went down to a 7. I think there is a slight runaway problem here. Outcome depends much on the lucky card draw. If you don't own neither very low nor very high number cards, it's not likely that you'll have much influence on increasing your character stats strategically (which is crucial on the outcome of the dice fights), nor will you get any of the ability cards. In most games, the winner was obvious after the third adventure, the strong lead he had gained until then couldn't really be effectively challenged anymore.

Good family game with quite a number of variants/options to customize to your preferred gaming style- difficulty setting, playing with children, more or less cooperative etc; but in the end the only thing that counts is who got the most treasure, which captures the book's spirit quite well IMHO. Better with more players.

Gra o trochę dziwnej mechanice, rywalizacyjna z elementami kooperacji (jak Smaug dojdzie do miasta to przegrywają wszyscy). Prosta, trochę losowa, pozwala na rozwój swego krasnoluda. Nie udało mi się jeszcze zagrać z poprawioną zasadą odnośnie możliwości podjęcia próby z karty przygody, gdzie nie wydaje się 2 znaczników chleba, a starczy je tylko posiadać, bez tego gra była dość frustrująca na dalszych etapach, z tą zasadą może ocena pójdzie trochę w górę.

Edit:
W sumie można powiedzieć, że całkiem spoko prosta przygodówka z niskim progiem wejścia, krótkim czasem gry (30-40min) i powiedziałbym, że całkiem sporą dawką losowości.

This game is really boring. It in many way seems to want to masquerade as a high-interaction, fun, semi-competitive adventure game. Unfortunately, you have surprisingly little control over the things that happen to you and your party, and the things you do have control over do not have much effect on the game. I can recommend this game for children/families, or for big John Howe fans who want to be able to have the game on their shelf- I can almost assure you that if you're looking for a deep or rich gameplay experience you will be left wanting.

1 partial play, GenCon 2012 (we all agreed to stop after the first 2 stops)

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
The board shows a track where each step is some kind of award or penalty; a marker for the characters starts at the beginning, and Smaug is placed at the end. Players have their own character boards, tracking 3 skills (which give you bonuses when rolling for axes or shields, ability to reroll dice). Players also start with a number of bread (lembas?) tiles as well as a hand of bid cards (deck of cards numbered 1-60).

The event deck is set up in stages, with each group of cards just enough to move you along the path towards specific stopping points. Initially, you just flip the card and do what it says; mostly, they are blind auctions where the winner gets some reward (advance along one of their character tracks, get extra bread, etc.). The movement cards are resolved in order, with each card moving the the marker one step forward and giving that player whatever is shown on the track (similar benefits: skill advancement, bread, etc.). Some cards are single-use cards that go to the auction winner and can be used later to, for example, modify dice rolls. After bidding, everyone draws a replacement bid card.

Eventually, you get to the next stage on the track. Here, the event cards are encounters; players bid and high-bidder gets to attempt to resolve the event first. If they fail, either everyone else bids again or you just go in descending order of the original bid; continue till event resolved or everyone fails. Resolution is generally with a single roll of the dice, which show different faces (e.g., axe, double-axe, shield, bread, etc.). You may use your special abilities to reroll dice if possible. If you succeed, your reward is the number of crystals (VP) shown on the card. Whenever someone fails against an event, they draw a tile which shows a penalty (e.g., advance Smaug, lose bread, lose an ability, etc.).

Continue this way, with alternating groups of get-stuff-events and fight-stuff-events until you get to the mountain and destroy the ring? The player with the most crystals wins. Or until Smaug gets to the village and everyone loses.

[b]--- Comments ---[/b]
What utter dreck! It's constant blind bidding, with no consolation for being 2nd-5th except that you get to have wasted your highest card for nothing! You just sort of plod along the track bidding over and over and over again. And with a range of 1-60, you're almost totally at the mercy of the cards you're dealt! 

Unless you love blind bidding, I can't imagine anyone loving this game! Booooooring!

This is a nice push-your-luck family game or something for Tolkien fans when they don't want to burn their brain too much. It's quick, has just enough strategy to keep it interesting, and plays very well solo. Theme-wise, there's nothing that doesn't feel pasted on, and competition between dwarves who are supposed to be helping Bilbo seems strange. There's not a great deal of variety but it's the sort of thing that can come out once in a while and entertain.

The Hobbit is a novel that tells the tale of a diminutive hero that, with the help of a group of stalwart dwarves, sets off to infiltrate Smaug’s lair in an effort to plunder the dragon’s vast hoard of treasure.

Good, light, family game which plays like a mix of Lord Of The Rings and Beowulf: The Legend. Competitive game (except for a bit of co-operation to stop Smaug from reaching Laketown) where players move along a story track collecting (and losing) different character abilities, resources and special ability cards through blind bidding; interrupted by four push-your-luck adventure stages where the collected abilities/resources plus dice rolls are used to complete quests for treasure (victory points).

[b]Thank you Secret Santa 2012![/b]

A fairly straightforward game, but there was a nice balance between luck and some light strategy.  Story-wise it was a little weird that once Smaug started progressing along the track to Laketown he wouldn't ever go back to the Lonely Mountain, but we reasoned that away by saying that he was out devastating the countryside. Silly dragon!  We also ran into the problem of people being down to zero of a particular resources/skill when they lost an adventure and therefore not losing anything.  I think we'll house rule it next time that you lose another skill or treasure if this happens.

A light game but enjoyable enough to play. The theme doesn't really come out in this game as much as I'd like unfortunately though.
Getting a bad run of dwarf cards can sometimes spoil a game though. When that happens it feels as though you don't have much impact in the game. I feel it would be better if some of the event cards allowed you to win by playing a dwarf card that is closest to 30 (the mid-way point) so that the bad luck aspect was mitigated a little.

RATING: 4
One of the worst implementations of blind bidding that I've ever seen, including the highly questionable mechanic of dealing players random bidding hands.

For ability card auctions, players with decent cards will bid high/low (whichever is required), and everyone else throws in the towel by tossing mid-level cards.

For traveling auctions, players fight over benefits that are potentially useless because adventure cards are drawn at random.  So travel auctions end up being tedious annoyances tied to unknowable outcomes.  Unless you're lucky enough to win the nigh-broken Ring power.  Or flip the right adventure cards.  Or decide to play something else.

Not for adults.  For kids and families, strictly.

There is very little thought to play. On a regular turn you try to out-guess your opponents and pick a number from your hand that gives you the best chance to what you want. On a fight turn, you calculate whether you can win or not and then fight or pass. Boring after the first play.

1-3/4 hours with 9 and 6 year-old and myself. The 6-yo won.

It's very nicely produced, with a very rich Middle-Earthian pallet and beautiful art.  We're all intimate with the story and we really enjoy re-telling it through the event and action cards: "...Oh yeah I remember that part!..."  We ran out of jewels before the end of the game in one play---very frustrating for greedy dwarves.

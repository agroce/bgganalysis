GAME: A Brief History of the World
RANK: 1579

RATING: 9
Have only played a 3 player version but the game was very good and quite fun.  Looking forward to 4 or 5 player game soon.

Rules could be written better as we kind of fumbled a bit on our first game.  Maybe a player aid other than the ones that show which civs go when and where.  But I give the game a big thumbs up.

RATING: 8
Much shorter play-time than the old version (roughly 30-45 minutes per player comparing with 1 hour+ each).
First play is based on memory of the old rules, while the second play found that the rules for the new version is unreadable!

RATING: 8
I like History of the World. This version has a nice, clean looking map, and some interesting new rules that make you feel more in control. The number of territories, units, and epochs have also been reduced, and the game takes much less time to finish.

I won't go so far as saying that it's better or more fun than older editions, but it plays much faster with pretty much the same feel, so that's great!

I still prefer the original, though.

RATING: 7
A light civ-game with some interesting mechanisms to keep things somewhat tight. Strings of bad dice rolling can completely put you out of commission though, but that simply implies that you need to assess risk and have a good understanding of when it is time to quit.

Tried it out tonight, with 6 players. A rules explanation meant that we played for 2.5 hours and stopped atthe end of epoch 4. Next time we'll get it done in an evening. Was impressed - a great experience game and I prefer the new dice combat system to the old, although views were mixed on this. I'm still not sure that winning reflects skill but it's no less enjoyable for this.

A good remake of the old. The map and graphics are much easier to visualise than the old version.

Each dynasty/Civilization brings in its own flavour to the board much like britannia.

Plays very well like a Euro-gamish Smallworld with much more complexity, as the areas are not always adjacent or nearby.

This is a great game, although keep your Analysis Paralysis players away.  Shorter and tighter than it's older brother History of the World, which I think is an improvement because the game can be long and involved. And it has a creative map that shows the world from the top down.

A similar (and not much shorter) romp to HotW.  An acquired taste.  Lots of dice.  But some strategy.  A game not to take the lead in until the right moment.  For mt, too much luck for the timeinvolved.  But not without interest and clever ideas.

This game is good, eliquibrate and very original (no discussion about this because the original history of the world is from the same authors). So you can see it as a remake of a game with a very original system. To me, this is no wargame, but a game of making the right choices. And it gives a good feeling about the real history of the world : powerfull armies for stronger empires, barbarians, certain properties for certain empires, minor kingdoms and so on.
The only thing that isn't right is the word "brief"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ok, this version is a little bit more brief than the old HotW. Around 15 minutes, I guess. On the other hand it has an inferior design and less attractive playing pieces. A big plus: The cards are now more balanced.

an interesting hybrid of wargame and civilization.  the draft mechanic for player roles coupled with scoring at the end of every round gives this a very different (read, better) feel than the tired old model of seize ground and hold it.  built-in catch up/leveling mechanisms also keep every player engaged until the end.  best of its genre - get the app if you can't afford the (justified) collector's pricing on print editions.  Or get the app anyway. :-)

easily the best game in my collection, period.

RATING: 7.25
Light Civ game that comes in at under 3 hours. Civilisation and ability cards are selected each epoch and as usual in a lot of these games, you score your points after your turn, so turn order is important. Leader gets last choice of the next epochs civs though, so it may not always benefit you to be leading (bonus tiles notwithstanding) as there's the chance that the game can overly suffer from stop the leader efforts of the players (rather than them always playing to beneft their own score), even though the game itself has these stop the leader mechanisms built in.

Still, it's a decent game and one I want to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First, the good.  Some empires have special abilities, "Fear", Conquistador", "Inheritance", etc. that adds a nice touch.

It does play a bit quicker than the AH/Hasbro version, but that is also its downfall.  Soooo much is given up to speed up game play.  Fewer Empires, fewer Lands, fewer and less variety of Events, less variation in Area scoring.  

The components, although functional, don't compare with the Hasbro game.  Generic armies; all epochs the same.  Die-cut counters for captitals, cities, forts, monuments.   

The invasion point/overrun system speeds up play, but takes away the suspense factor.

My group finished the game feeling empty.  Many fewer choices to make.  Less exciting. Less visually appealing.  

Just an ok version of a classic game, go with the AH/Hasbro version if you can get it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Provisional rating, need to play it more.

If you liked HoTW this is just better ... the distribution of events and nations is a major improvement, combat is slicker and luck of the dice significantly reduced (no more losing 18 mongols trying to break through the wall of China). I'm still not convinced about the end game though - last turn there is NO incentive to attack someone who has been (they've scored their points now), meaning going late in the last Epoch is bad news ...

We 'fixed' that in HoTW by gaining half points at the end of the game - might consider trying that with this version too.

Overall - like it.

A big improvement on the original! The board's simpler, the combat quicker, and the turn sequence fairer; all of which makes for a faster and tighter game, without the downtime issues of the old version.

I like the Hasbro/Avalon Hill version better, but this is still good. It shortens the game a bit, and takes out some of the randomness, but the aesthetics are nowhere near as good as the H/AH game. Given a choice between saving 45 minutes or having a good looking board and pieces to use, I prefer the better components.

RATING: 8
Interesting - it's a fair while since I played the original but I think the changes made here are mainly improvements, though I'm not sure they cut that much time (other than the obvious step of removing the final era - which is the way I recommend you play the earlier versions too - unless you fancy a nap while someone else establishes the British Empire.  

Overall though, I remember enjoying the original more - but I'm not sure whether that's because it was a better game or just a lot fresher experience at the time - many games have come along in its wake which built on its sucess and eroded the novelty factor.  None of the challengers provide the same sweep of history though and HotW, Brief or not, still takes some beating.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The problem with some of these attempts to streamline and clean up old classics is that once you've streamlined the systems, gotten rid of the cruft, turned screws and tightened things up, you realize that at the end of the day, there just is no game there. That would be the case for HotW. Risk, especially in it's Star Wars and Halo incarnations, is just a much superior game. And if you aren't either better than, or different from, Risk there just isn't a lot of point, obviously. History of the World, and A Brief History of the World, is all about the last turn. It's a race not to be in first or second place on the last turn, to save your resources until the end. Because if you are in first or second going in to the end, you are guaranteed to lose unless your margin is enormous, which is impossible because the game is so damped. It's really painful.

Small World finally got this problem right, as did Britannia 25 years or so ago. Just play those game and avoid any version of History of the World like the plague. It was a decent enough game in a thin field 20 years ago. Today, forget it.

RATING: 7
Pretty cool civ game that sweeps you through the history of civilization.  I really enjoy getting to develop a civilization for a turn and then getting to start all over with a new one the next turn, hoping my old civ sticks around for a while to score me some more points before someone wipes it out!  This is the aspect I really enjoy in Vinci and Small World, so I knew I would appreciate that aspect of this game.

Much of the game boils down to selecting the civ that will benefit you the most.  Each round there is basically a draft for who gets to run which civ.  The last place players drafts first, getting the best choice of civs.  The draft is really where you're going to make or break your game, and there can be some really tough decisions of what to choose!  Also neat is that there are 7 possible civs for each of the 6 epochs, but you only use as many civs per epoch as there are players in the game.  This is done randomly, so different civs are going to appear each time you play, making the game different from game to game.  Neat stuff!

Overall, a great entry into the civ genre.  You might be disappointed if you want a more detailed civ game where you get to really flesh out a civ, but it's great if you're into the broad brush sweep through history aspect of civ games.

RATING: 2
An extremely long, with lots of downtime, simple, shallow, dice used as resolution, bash the leader game with a war theme.

There is zero fun in this game.

On a positive note, in a six player game, your presence is not required when it isn't your turn, so you can go away, watch an episode of 30 Rock, and then come back and only have to wait five or ten minutes until it's your turn again.

First play may have been a bit anomalous, but a 6p game didnt' seem any shorter/faster than my memories of the parent game. So I kept wondering, "Why am I not just playing History of the World?"

The production is excellent. I'd be very interested to play again...but not with 6p again. I suspect 4p is the sweet spot.

I really like how they addressed the possibility of a king-maker by awarding hidden bonus VP chits, but making the primary score recorded on an open track. It avoids the endgame issues of Vinci, without creating a situation where the leader is a big surprise at the game-end and people are incorrectly targeting someone else.

RATING: 5
This game entered my collection after a pleasant first encounter at an aquaintance's gaming party, and has since been played once every while over the years. It is best described as a crossover between Risk and Vinci, taking good and bad bits from both games and ending up somewhere in the middle in terms of design and appeal. 

Good bits are a nice sweeping feeling of human history, and some effective special abilities which despite their simplicity mesh quite well with the game's diverse set of civilisations. Combat isn't too mind-numbing either in that it is over and done with fairly quickly. But the bad bits... well, I'm not fond of them and they keep on growing worse on every occasion I play. The most glaring of these are the capriciousness of the dice which can make or break your game even despite the pleasing concept of Overrun; and the blatant balancing act introduced by genuinely horrific civilisations like Romans, Mongols and British which cause admittedly thematic mayhem but throw the entire game in disarray. Given the length of time you're playing the swings of fortune often encountered are grating. Yes, some defense is possible through the use of forts, but they are expensive buggers to put up for the vast majority of civs, and easily circumvented too (literally, in this case).

All in all the whole is a mixed bag I'm no longer as fond of as I briefly was. There are better games to play when I want to scratch the dudes-on-a-map itch; the fact that Brief History is about human history doesn't really hold any special emotion for me. Consequently I'm not sure why I keep holding onto it, too. Well, that's not entirely true: my partner would 'Overrun' me if I were to put up the game for sale or trade. 

The '5' is really rather generous, I feel.

I like the rules tweaks, even the ones that I was skeptical of.  I miss the figures, though the tokens make things a bit easier.

I now feel like I have more control over my own destiny.

RATING: 6
I've played the first edition several times when it first came out but just recently gave this version a shot.

They've shortened the game a bit and added some game balancing elements, which is good in theory, but those same mechanisms also have the side effect of increasing game length due to analysis paralysis.

The game is still decent, much like I remember it. But these days it sits somewhere between Struggle of Empires, which is a little longer but more interesting and Small World, which is simpler and shorter, and that's not a good place to be in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This version is more streamlined than he original but still has plenty difficult problems to over come - being in the lead is a definate handicap to getting the empire you desire next but likewise it is not at all easy to manouvre a late points rush from behind. The epic feel of empires sweep through history only to wither and die is all still there. So in summary a great evenings entertainment.

Despite the spruce up this has had from the original 'History of the World' edition it is still showing it's age as a design. The over-run mechanic does help mitigate some of the dice luck and speeds things up a little but the combat mechanic is a little 'old school'.

The game is fun when played in the right spirit and with the right crowd and remains a good option for a strategy game for non-gamers to sit down with gamers to play.

It should though be titled 'Slightly Briefer History of the World' as with 5 or 6 players (and it needs at least 4 for enough of the Empires to come out for game balance reasons) it remains a 3 hour+ game with some down-time issues. Having said that it is better than the original and I can't see much point in playing the original over this both for the slightly shorter playing time and the other refinements.

RATING: 8
Players take turns playing out historical empires over six epochs of history, from Sumerians to Britain.  Players establish and expand their empires, instigating combat and removing previous empires.  Points are scored for area control, which rise and fall over the course of the game, as well as for cities, monuments and bonuses.  Most points at the end of the game wins.  I think this is the fourth edition of this game, and it feels much cleaner than the previous two Avalon Hill games I have played.  One epoch shorter, about a third of the areas from the older editions have been removed, and empires have less armies to deploy.  This combined with a new overrun mechanic means there is a lot less die rolling, thus a quicker game.  A couple of other nice features - the +1 modifier for failed invasions, and the "features" that some civilizations have add some good flavour.  Only tried a couple of four player games, but it seems to come in around 150 minutes now, about 90 minutes shorter than the older editions for us.  I kind of miss the different minis from the previous edition, but they were a pain to sort.  All in all, a nice remake.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Seems like a very well-playtested update of the classic I love. I see the merits of this, and they did a great job of shaving hours off the playing time while keeping the balance the same. You can complete it in a short night instead of an all-afternoon game.  

All said I'd rather commit to the more baroque Hasbro edition and spend the time!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A solid blend of Small World and Risk.  Even if it pre-dates SW, the comparison still feels right.   The area majority scoring of the regions here is similar to Twilight Struggle the way that prescence, domination, and control are calculated.   It's a solid option for a 5 or 6 player wargame, even if a bit long (3-4 hours).  4 players seems to be the sweet spot. There is a lot of downtime, which makes it a casual game since you cannot do a lot of forward planning because the landscape of who-controls-what is surely going to change before you can act, and you don't know what cards or nationalities you will be getting in future rounds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very nice speedier update of an old favorite.  Seems more balanced and less luck dependent.  I really like the new overrun rule.

For new comers, I see this as the granddaddy of Small World.  More depth, etc.

It really isn't that brief.  I do find it oddly enjoyable - though a lot of mechanics in the game seem fairly outdated.

Fun area control game with great simulationist historical theme. It plays like Small World on steroids.

Duration: Longer that I'm usually comfortable with, but I enjoyed it.
Design: There is a fairly clean core set of rules, though the boats still confuse the heck out of me. I was able to play it out on land.
Strategy: It's a bit like Risk plus Small World plus other stuff; the major choices are which civs you want to play and which you want to pass on, and whether you want to gamble for greater wins.
Components: Decent, I liked the epoch score counters and the map with the weird projection but it was all pretty utilitarian.
Theme: Extremely historical, with different civilisations popping up one after the other. Very well done.

Most innovative world map interpretation, IMO- top down perspective (from the North Pole). Does it really shorten HOTW that much?  I still think that History of the World is a better game (if you have the time). My main gripe with ABHotW is that you have so many fewer units than in HOTW, which makes this game somehow feel less epic. Also, the purple box edition of HOTW has a very similar map, but with more spaces, &  really produces the feeling of an epic conquest across the map. Brief History also kills the gameplay a bit by allowing the player in last place to pick civilizations, which encourages players to drag/do poorly.

Pretty good, but for me the Avalon Hill 1993 version (the one with counters not minis) is still the best. This iteration is just too simplified and damped. Shortening the game seemed like a good idea, but do you really want to play a civ that only gets two or three armies?

The overrun rules are great, though. I might see whether they work with the older game.

Nice.  Combination Euro and Ameritrash.  Fairly light rule set but the game can last several hours.  I do think there is a balance issue for those in the lead.  The advantage can lead to a runaway situation.

RATING: 7
Played the old version once with 6 (6 hours) and this "Brief" version once with 4 (3 hours). The old version played with 6 was horrific having a massive issue with downtime. The new version played with 4 was much better though there is nothing to do when it isn't your turn except occasionally roll a dice if you are attached. The changes made to the new version are very well thought out. I am actually surprised this is not in the BGG top 50. I certainly respect the design which properly portrays the history of the World in 3 hours and provides a well balanced game at the same time. April 2011

I have always been a HUGE fan of History of the World, so it was with a bit of trepidation that I approached a game that was designed to steamline it.  While I'm not enamored with all of the changes, the game is still excellent and very faithful to the original.

Quite different to the original HOTW in a number of aspects particularly the over run makes a big difference. 
But it is fundamentally the same game, but that is certainyl not to its detrement.
the time is shortened quite considerably with 5 players 3 hours from end to end.
I liked it, will play it again.

Thematically and in many ways this could be a 9.5/10 but the mechanics just frustrated me. It's sort of like a dull area control game with a simplistic war mechanic and then trump cards.

RATING: 4
I found this to be a longer and less fun version of Small World.

The game play is pretty similar except Small World gives you the same amount of fun in 60 minutes instead of 180. Brief History gives you some chrome and tactical options with its card play but they don't add enough fun to make up for the extra complexity they add, IMHO.

By sticking to a map of the real world and following the rise and fall of real empires the game feels too scripted. It also means the game can't have multiple maps to change play balance when there are different numbers of players. (i.e. with 5 players you have a larger map; with 3 you have a smaller map.)

I didn't like the dice-based combat system. In a game of this length you need better ways to mimimize the effects of unlucky rolls.

Every turn one person will have absolutely no control over which empire they control. Everyone at the table hated it and decided if we played it again we'd house rule that.

Played Epochs 1-3 at Spiel Essen 2009.  I'm a fan and a long-time player of the first version and I thought this was better in almost every way.  I will be selling/trading my older copy.  Enjoyed the streamlined combat, better luck/strategy ratio for my preference, nice components, play time decreased to fit in a game-night slot.  Top notch.

It promises a shorter play experience than that of a full "History of the World", and succeeds in my opinion. I still prefer the original, but this version is playable with 6 players in a reasonable amount of time.

RATING: 8
It's quite an improvement over the other two iterations of the game I've played.  The playtime wasn't significantly reduced from what I remember as drafting took quite a while, but I could see it going down with familiarity.

I liked all the improvements that were made, and would really like to give it another try.  I'm sad that I have an older copy of the game and don't really want to drop 70 bucks to upgrade.

RATING: 6
Well, it may be a 'brief history', but it only runs 30 minutes or so shorter than the original. Those that know the game well will clearly be at an advantage against newcomers or the casually interested, in being aware of which empires will come out and where they start. Lots of randomness in the dice and the extent to which you're picked on by others will be a major success factor, but there's certainly fun here, so I'd be prepared to play this occasionally, which is more than I can say for the base game.

This is very, very much like a heavier, or at least more-historical-chrome-added, version of Vinci/Small World, and I really like A Brief History of the World better because of that historical flavor.

The successive empires work well both thematically and mechanically. Problems: 1) loads of downtime; 2) overwhelming catchup mechanism, to the point where if you make the mistake of being just a point in the lead going into the last round, you're pretty much guaranted to lose; 3) and of course the randomness of the die rolls. Might be for me if it were only an hour long; as it is, I'll pass.

If this is Brief, hand me the Double Extra Brief. It's not a bad system and I particularly like the pass-it-along distribution of Event and Empire cards.

RATING: 5.5
Definitely didn't like this, for a few reasons.

(1) So little control over which factions you choose. Best case scenario, you're behind by just a few veeps going into a turn with the Romans or the Mongols or another ultrapowerful faction. Who wants to spend a few turns jockeying for last place? Especially when there's no guaranteed outcome? This could be worked around by having some kind of VP bid for the various factions, but as it stands, it seems a bit rank.

(2) The game leads you by the nose. 

(3) If you're winning, that likely means not only are you going to end up all over the board, but anyone with a build anywhere near you is going to hammer you instead of other people, despite the high probability that you're striking out against your foes with the puny Gupta empire.

I dunno, maybe I'm not making sense. It just felt like there were four turns where everyone beats up on everyone else, and then two turns where they earn all their most relevant VPs. 

I'd play it again to see if I feel differently, but so far, I'm definitely underwhelmed.

Also, they just should've called it "A History of the World." Our game lasted 3.5 hours, which is 2.5 longer than Small World or Vinci would've taken, with a bit less satisfaction. There's a lot of downtime where you just want to tell someone to roll the dice for you, and get up and wander around for half an hour.

History of the world is a favourite of mine, this struggles to live up to that as I miss the extra epoch and never found that the AH version too long. We used to play the AH version in about 2.25 hours, so no need for the game to get shorter. This version is still fun, but for me not quite as good.

This is a good game, but at three hours feels too long.  It could probably be played faster once the game is familiar, but I don't feel a strong inclination to play it again.  I won't say no if others really want to play it, but it's not likely I'll ever suggest it.

Nice reworking of History of the World.  It is still recognizably the same game, but streamlined to play faster.  I suspect I will never go back to the original, despite my fondness for it.  Brief plays in 1/2 the time, and provides the same pay-off.  Recommended.  

However - this is an old-school game.  Direct confrontation, and take-that sort of game play.  I enjoy such now and again.  But some folks may not love this.

I'm uncertain after one play how I feel about the changes from the AH/Hasbro edition which I've played numerous times.  I like the concept of the civ and event cards starting from opposite ends of the score spectrum and being chosen accordingly.  I also really enjoy the over-run aspect to conflict although that can be quite painful if it happens to oneself!  Forts are more valuable in this edition as it stops over-runs.  Is it much shorter?  I don't know if I'd say it is much shorter.  The bonus points being given to the three players who are in front at the end of each epoch also prevents one person from running away with the win via bonus points.

It felt similar to Small World and I imagine it resembles Vinci even more. However, it's much more tactical and less strategic than those games. That's not necessarily a bad thing.

Brief is a relative term.  Our game came in at about 150 minutes.  Third turn, I got the Roman Empire.  Fourth turn, I got to go first (Byzantine?), and was untouchable.  That was an hour or so into the game, so the next 90 minutes were pretty dull.

New edition of the classic civilisation game. This definitely feels like an improvement. The game is tighter and shorter and the luck factor has been greatly reduced.

There's now a real dilemma in which empire to choose and how to play it.

I think of this game as a sampler platter of world history: you don't get a lot of any one thing, but you do get to explore (at a very broad level) a lot. It's most interesting to me to see how the different ways for empires to interact with each other over time.

I like the gameplay of this revision more than that of the original History of the World. It certainly cuts down on playing time, and it's nice that there is less randomness in empire selection. The special abilities of some of the empires help give them some additional specifity and flavoring. It's too bad it doesn't have all of the beautiful, historically-fitting miniatures of the AH version (which I also own).

This is more comprehensive (comparatively speaking), but I rather prefer the original (actually, the Hasbro version) for its ease of play.  For the first time play, we found the rules "lacking" in several "basic" areas:  (1) the lack of explanation of the symbol on the map (since only one, I guess it was obvious); (2) the lack of explanation of the symbols on the cards (especially the empire cards)--really, would it cost that much to print a picture explaining which number/symbol refers to the armies, capitals, etc.; and (3) the vagueness of some of the rules, i.e., resigning, etc.--which is somewhat natural for players of the original, but not for all first time players.  Overall, a very fun game, but could have been easier to learn/teach if the rules and examples would have been much, much better.

RATING: 6.2
UPDATE: Still prefer the AH version after two plays of Brief, though you can get in a 5-player, 3-hour game. But the sense of something epic is missed.

The Ragnar Bros. turned their proto-Ameritrash game into a Euro!  OK, I guess that works, but if I'm going to play such a long, involved game, I'll go for the deluxe cheese-steak sandwich with lots of onions and peppers.  The new version feels chintzy next to the Hasbro version, although there are definitely some rules that should be retro-fitted onto the older model.

The Hasbro version is like an opera written by Puccini.  Kinda trashy, loud, and long, but nonetheless an opera.  ABHotW is a modern opera; still long, but with the passions, angst, and thunder sucked out of it.

Basically, the game feels A LOT like Risk, though it has a more thematic framework with some funny stuff and neat ideas (a leader for each civilization that may grant a certain advantage etc.). Ages 3 and above will frequently see a player just rushing through the world, as often seen in Risk (depending on your rules, of course). That makes the game swingy. It seems hardly possible to play on continuity. There always seem t0 be very strong civilizations that CAN rush the board - the questions are: 1.) Does another player pick it? 2.) If yes: Who will be targeted where? 

A bit too much downtime, which could certainly become a more serious fun killer with 4+ players. Last but not least: The colours of the map are simply AWFUL to look at.

Too long for what is is, and the "give the player at the back loads of armies" catch-up mechanism just doesn't seem very creative. Four player wasn't too bad, but five player was mega-downtime, especially if the variable turn order had you going last in one turn and first in the next.

Fun game, reminded us of smallworld somewhat, with the armies 'going to sleep' after you're done conquering with them. I had a really big advantage because I was in last place when starting the last turn, so I could pick the British and conquer the Americas, Africa and Australia and leave the others with a lot of armies they needed to eliminate. Not sure if that's just because we played with just 3, or if this is a real problem the game has, or just an (un)lucky draw of the epoch cards (there were no ocean-faring nations before the 6th epoch). I'd like to play again to find out, rating 7 for now...

Ancestor of Small World. The theme is great and the passage of civilizations is great. The game structure reduces play to complete luck: leaders will get the weakest civilizations next turn, those behind will get the best ones. Many civilizations are trivial: giving you so little armies you can barely make a strategic decision of any importance. The only part of the game that requires thinking is when you chose your civilization, the rest is pretty much auto play: expand as much as possible from your starting point, fortresses are barely worth building, try to get good rolls and not lose too many armies to bad rolls. You get a little more flexibility in the last two Epochs where the stragglers get a last chance to get the most powerful civs. Good game, terrible strategy.

The big plus is that it plays similar to History of the World but in significantly less time. The down side is that there is an equivalent loss in strategies.

As zzyzxuk said when teaching the game "This is what Risk should have been". A lot of fun but I didn't really get the event cards and I think it cost me in the game.

I am a huge fan of the first version of this game from Avalon Hill.  I was not as crazy about the second version as I thought it took some of the strategy away by taking out the fleets and allowing multiple armies per area.  I did like some things about this new version.  I liked the individual abilities that some of the empires have.  I also like the revised combat system.  It plays fairly similar to the second version.  I did not find it all that much shorter in game length.  So, I like this version similar to the second version, but still prefer the original.

RATING: 5
rating after 1 play (5pl) - 6

marked down in part due to length and knowledge of when all the civs will come into play so rating may rise

rating after 2 plays (6pl) - 4

isnt much of a 'game' more 'entertainment' - see below and with this in mind its a reasonably enjoyable romp thru history..or at least it wldv been..had it taken about 2-2.5hrs instead of the SIX HOURS it did take

there is A LOT of randomness in this game and A LOT of downtime - the only thing to do when its not ur turn is to tell other ppl what to do which makes it bizarrely cooperative...

...oh i cant be bothered - theres too much i dont like and it takes forever - dont bother

not enuff player aids included
inidv civs should have tokens so can be tracked on board just for fun
dice too random
civs that come out too random
jostling for turn order - too random UNLESS everyone calculates to the exact coin which would make the game take FOREVER
way too scripted - just do whats obv for ur civ and move on
oh yeah and u need to know what all the civs do, when they come out, what all the events do etc BEFORE u start playing or ul be hammered by later civs and by players who know the game better
oh and its strangely uninteractive cos other players just hammer ur old civs and they cant react so oddly feels unaggressive

RECCS:
dunno - wld recc small world or vinci bit not overly keen on small world the 1 time i played tho they r both much shorter and no dice BUT i hate pure determinitive combat just as much as dice hvy cos its so souless/chesslike

if u want a 4hour civ/warfare game with 5/6 players then i dunno yet what to suggest but I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW TOO!!!

RATING: 4
Even though it is shorter than the original, while playing it doesn't *feel* much shorter than the older version of the game, so "Brief" in the title is a little misleading. It's still a good 3+ hour game with a full compliment of players- not exactly brief. A lot of the time that was taken away by streamlining the game play was added back in with the card drafting.

I like the way that the power cards are introduced into the game, the fact that some cards cost victory points now, the re-roll bonus on a fail, the empire drafting, the powers unique to some empires and the bonus for being in the lead. 

I don't like the change to terrain (from directional to covering an entire area), the simplified map or the lower number of units each empire produces. I feel like the simplified map and lack of units really takes away a lot of the strategy and tactical maneuvering that really elevate the older version of the game. I also really don't like the whole overrun mechanic this version of the game introduces.

Overall it's still a fun, but different, experience from History of the World. It feels a little dumbed down in some areas, and some of the changes are quite welcome. This is a mixed bag for me.

Compared to its ancestor "History of the World" it falls down a bit. Although some things were improved (for example the length of the game) others seem to lose against the cult of the original version. But what stays is that this game is an absolutely entertaining and tactical game which makes much fun for every participant.

I missed the different unit for the ages from the Avalon Hill version.  I very much liked the way empire selection worked and this it would be good to retrofit this to the older version.  The event cards were also a good idea.  I liked the plus for continued battle.  The events seems trickier to use as the best had significant cost in vp making them harder to use for a benefit.

Whatever this loses from the original has to be worth it for the increased playability. Kind of funny how it is 'brief' still requiring a good 3 hours to play. 

Anyhow, components are really nice, and the combat rules are definitely an improvement.

RATING: 7
A fun Risk style game, but much better than the Risk comparison suggests. You're taking varied civilisations through six epochs with plenty of decent decisions along the way and a good dice rolling combat mechanic. Choosing an empire is an interesting choice with turn order, army strength, current board position and special abilities all coming into play. On top of which it's good fun. A shorter and more streamlined version of the original. It reminds me of Vinci, but the dice combat adds a welcome element of uncertainty to the proceedings. Happy to play.

I don't know if calling this a civilization game is right, cause the I+D part is almost nonexistent, but it is sure a fun,tense and emotional one. Players recreate history leading one of the most important civilizations of the world to its major expansion, and then take another in the next period of time to do the same, achieving points mostly for the lands, cities and lands that they control. Practical, quick, easy to grasp and intuitive.

Good to see an old favourite updated. However, as our group can play the original HotW in around 3+ hours, the 'brief' descrption may not be so pertinent. The new rules on combat are much better with less die rolling and, with fewer map areas each Empire should be played in about 3-4 minutes.
The yellow lettering on the grey Empire cards are hardly legible. In fact Gary and Steve shared the same stand as me at Essen09 and they said that the original prototypes were not that bad. I guess it shows that sometimes getting pre-production blueprints can be very useful.

iOS play only.

This is sort of like a cross of Risk and Vinci, but close to the latter.

Like Risk, you've got dudes on a map of the world. You roll dice for combat, but it's simpler and faster here: attacker rolls 2, defender rolls 1, with terrain and event card modifiers. Rolling really well can also cause a chain reaction of expansion (overruns).

Like Vinci, players will play a succession of civilizations. Here, though, it will be 1/epoch/player, plus possibly some extra mini empires. You score for current and past civs. Each civ has a different civ power, although each empire is always the same base power (though event cards can modify things a bit). Combat is pretty simple, too.

Better than Vinci:
- covers the entire world
- more historical seeming, covering longer time period
- partially hidden scores (end of each epoch, top 3 players get bonus VP, hidden)

Worse than Vinci:
- civ powers not as interesting
- random dice rolls for combat
- much less variety in civ powers
- longer play time? hard to say based on iOS play only...

I suspect I'll like Vinci more, but wil have to try this a bit.

I'm not sure what to think of this game. It's a game that offers a different experience from what I usually have when playing. It has some originality in the way things work together.

I like the theme. It simulates a civilization game but it doesn't feel much like that because everything is constantly disapering from the map. A civilization comes and goes and there's nothing players can do to refrain that because that's exactly the way the game works.

It's more playable with 3/4 players than with more because the downtime is something ridicously long and dull. Everyone plays alone (almost) and, if a player has to wait for 5 turns to play it's very very boring so I would say that 3/4 players is the only way I'll b playing this game although I admit there are more advantages in getting more players into play such as tightness in the map, more events and civilizations participating on it.

The amount of armies seems to be the core aspect of this game but also the order of entrance in play for each civilization. It seemed clear that if a player changes strong from an epoch to the next he should try to play early in the game so that he can expand before someone destroys his armies. And if a player is weak, a good entrance could be in the end of the epoch so that he can prepare two turns ahead and build a secure fortress to score a lot in the next turns.
it's a not a game that can be dominated by heart and that's a positive thing to say about it. It evolves a certain amount of deep strategy and tactics that I like. It balances the three aspects - tactics, strategy and luck - in a very fine way.
The overrun rule can be too much powerful but it can also reduce the frustration of a bad result in a couple of dice rollings because there's no way a player can have bad luck for all the game - or is there?

It's a keeper. I really have to play it again now that I understand it better but I'm not sure if this is the kind of game I would like to play more than once or twice a year.

Production values are average with the components being in plastic (which I hate) and the cards being not thick enough. I understand that production costs should be reduced but since it has a cover from Peter Dennis I would also liked to see this game with components like the ones Treefrog uses in its line. A good civilization game has to have good above average components!

Definitely an improvement to the original.

Update after a dozen games on my iPad:
The shorter playing time (6 epochs instead of 7, less empires, less armies, etc.) is a big advantage in comparison to the original.
On the other hand: I really miss the "jockeying" for position that was so prominent in the old version.
Here you just play as best as you can with each empire and you have no control on which empires you will get in the future. There is really no point in deliberately playing "bad" just to avoid first place and getting bad empires in the future.
The bonus victory tokens are a clear sign that the designers have been aware of this problem as well.

The sprawling, epic, dice-laden conquest game re-vamped to simplify some things, reduce luck, speed up combat and generally make it more approachable.

We've only played once, but our 5-player game went on significantly longer than advertised, with more downtime than we usually tolerate. Familiarity would reduce playing time, but we'd play so infrequently that our games would probably remain too long.

THEME: ** The vict pt system that is typical of so many   games is most annoying for me.  I think you really should score for whatever your best empire scored, not some cumulative total of a string of unrelated empires . I had the sumerians the babylonians, the Han the  Franks and the Dutch for 175 pts. What the hell is that suppose to mean? 

ERGONOMICS *** Actually pretty easy to play and had virtually no rules questions. And the play time is appropriate for this sort of epic genre. 

CREATIVE *** It has some real nice mechanics that make up for bad die rolls. Also the card draw is fairly interesting, I just really wish these were more random. Like you could draw the Incas in turn one, or draw the Sumerians in the last round. That would be really interesting. These sort of missed oppurtunities often disappoint me, even though a little unfair to the game.

Very compelling--like Risk with real history and not so boring.  Starts at dawn of history and works through historical empires in order.  Not complete simulation, very basic, but very fun, and mechanic of last-place player picks first in each of 6 epochs means it's always a race to see who wins.  Ted loves, Shannon likes, Lauren not as keen.  Excellent iPad version, where it really shines is 4-5 players.  Perfect to help teach kids some history with gaming.

Probably the most fun Civ board game I've played, as it doesn't get too bogged down, and cleverly manages to keep a very good pace. Played a 6p with 4 new to it, in 3.5 hrs which is pretty good going for this type of game. Enjoyable, and has a clever weighting mechanism that pins back the leader, but still allows the best player to assert.

Risk meets Small World. A Brief History of the World certainly melds theme and gameplay together in a very smooth way, and does give some semblance of the rise and fall of empires. I can't help contrasting this with Small World, however, and it suffers in the comparison. Small World offers more control, more player interaction, greater control and less luck, more variety and a much shorter time frame. Those who just naturally gravitate toward lengthy games will prefer A Brief History of the World, but I think I'll be adding Small World to my collection instead.

There's the basis of a good game here, but it's somewhat ruined by the overly harsh nature of the gameplay. It's all too easy to be totally wiped out each and every turn, and there's very little you can do about it. That means you can't plan ahead because each turn you're either starting again from scratch or close to it. Which is shame. Ultimately not much fun.

There is a *high* degree of chance involved in this game and sometimes whoever wins overall seems to have luck on their side more than others.

This version of History of the world is exactly what it is promised: Brief!
I really like the new mechanics for battle. They bring the necessary randomness and at the same time they counteract it. Clearly a clever design.
The game is similar to the Avalon Hill version, but it is shorter by design (it takes about 3 hours). The decision making of what civilizations to take is much more critical. So there is much more strategy. You will not be disappointed!
The Avalon Hill version has better components, but the map has been more functional now.
I wish to see an expansion in the future, that will bring more civilizations and events. Some of us, like this game to run in 4 to 6 hours!

RATING: 7
Strange game in that you spend most of your time rolling dice without other players' input (and then waiting for them to do the same), and the interaction comes from a relatively brief drafting phase between the various eras. I'm embarrassed to say it took me half of a game before I saw where the strategy was.

Basically each era you draft an empire with the order being based on your current score standings (leading player picks empire last but "event" card first). At least one empire will be randomly removed from the game (more if fewer than six players). Set in stone is the order in which the empires will play and how strong they are. You get rewards for area majority and such. Your empires stick around after you finish playing them, until someone later comes to "overwrite" them. You still score for the accomplishments empires that haven't been overwritten yet, so if you have possessions on the board at the time you're drafting, it can be advantageous to draft an empire that is earlier in turn order, or one that won't simply overwrite an empire you already had (such as drafting China when the last Chinese dynasty was yours and is still on the map).

Reminiscent of World Conquerors and surely (via the original HOTW) influenced its design. In WC empires are played from your hand and there's no requirement to stick to a realistic timeline, so there's more variation in that sense. I think I slightly prefer Brief History as WC has rules issues, chaotic cardplay, and a wonky combat mechanic. WC probably plays faster though.

Another boardgame purchased from the Essen Meister collection, a rival to Chapman's Emporium for discarded games of yesteryear. Played two or three time and one that I intend to regularly revisit.
Thanks to everyone; Rod Chapman, Jim Falkus, Peter Heatherington and Chris Taylor, for persisting with 'A Brief History of the World', which weighed in at a four hour duration in the end! This was not the intention, but as a new game, we all took a similar time to complete each turn. Inevitably, there were one or two KRO's, most notably the effect of fleets, which I would suggest allow a seaborne invasion into any adajacent land to the sea or ocean in which they are based. Accepting the naval power event card, this does mean each attack only gets one basic dice, instead of two, so the leader and weaponry event cards would be similarly reduced. The fleets allow the attacker to circumvent difficult terrain, potentially, and any forts that are likely to be placed on landside borders rather than coastal areas. I enjoyed the game, and being first to go is a big disadvantage, perhaps accepting the Romans, the Mongols and the British, as they are the three main protagonists in their respective epochs. I hope you would all consider playing again....in the not too distant future and I have copied these comments to those not on Face Ache.
 
   Thanks for your comments on 'A Brief History of the World', although not so brief first time round, for the newness of the game to everyone, myself included, so thanks for bearing with it. Jim Falkus made the following observations; "I thought BHotW was a decent game and with experience would definitely speed up. It was kind of you to take on the responsibility of finding a game for Friday night and I know what it's like when you are trying to teach a game that's quite new to you. I do it a lot with Scott as he tends to spend his money on more sensible things like wine, women and song - literally". Even with the ropier nations, Rod still won, partly because he was the player who collected a bonus token every turn, so pipping Chris at the post! I am going to prerpare a rules summary which I will let everyone have in advance of the next game, which will highlight a few nuances, like fleets being used for invasion at a reduced (one D6) effect. The other useful 'strategy', as I indicated to Jim, is to try to get one or two of the nations who are more remote to invasion, like the Chinas and the Americas, as these clock up points over several epochs until the rise of the Spanish and the 'Land of the Free' in later epochs. I prefer the invasion point carry over to the old system, although there may be a case for letting forts add +1 to the defender die roll rather than preventing overruns, as a house rule, like the original rules (that did not have overruns). We could also restrict each player turn to five minutes using one of those egg timer thingies Dylan was touting....

Disappointed overall, though it's still a fine game. I wish every civ had a special rule, and the card assignment--the best part of the game!--has much less tension and interest than the old way. The board play is a bit faster, but I'm unconvinced that the random "swinginess" is toned down all that much; in fact, in some cases it clearly increases (the high-differential player will have an easier time of it).

I guess it's mostly a case of expectations.  They did tinker, and I guess it's improved, but I wish they had gone further. I still hope for a HOTW/Brit/Vinci mashup someday.

RATING: 9
Rating based on 1 play.  I've been waiting to play this for a good while and it didn't disappoint.  I love the way the empire specialities work and that players aren't knocked out, they just come back with a new civilisation and can get revenge!
Straight onto my wish & want lists!
Update: 2nd play and enjoyed it just as much!

After an initial high rating this is rapidly going downhill. The civilisation mechanism is excellent but determining the winner is all a bit random and for this reason its not worth playing with more than 4 players.

The mechanic that emulates the decay of civilizations is just way cool. Despite the theme of rampaging hordes, the game doesn't feel too confrontational because you can always grab another civilization and start over somewhere else. I use the start-of-game variation where the last player who will place gets to pick their starting civ first. (E.g. in a 4-player game, after the turn order is determined, the picking order goes 4-3-2-1, then players go onto the board 1-2-3-4.)

My favorite &quot;world conquest&quot; game, nudging out History of the World by a nose.  History of the World has the theme, but Vinci is a better (and shorter) game.

An interesting game with the same gameidea as 7ages, where you take control over different civilizations over time. But where 7-Ages fails because of all the exceptions, Vinci succeeds by having a great flow of play and easy rules.

A mix between History of the World and Risk.  I like so much about this game.  Raising empires and then having to figure out when to ditch.  I have to play this with hidden points.

A stream-lined civ game with interesting timing that I don't quite have my head wrapped around. I enjoyed playing this and would do so again... but Tempus might scratch this itch a bit better for me.

RATING: 7
Vinci is a good game that giving you multiple tough decisions to make each turn. All moves are significant and the situation constantly changes over the course of the game, which makes it interesting until the very end. 

Obviously Vinci must be compared with Small World because the latter is based on Vinci. If we cut some corners, you could say that both play the same and give the exact same experience. In principle I agree but there are a few key differences between the two:

---

Changes affecting tactics:
1) In Vinci your active race must control regions connected to each other. This gives more tactical depth to the game as you must be careful not to split your race into two or more separate areas. On the other hand you can use this rule as a weapon to achieve your goals.

2) Moreover, in Vinci your active and declined race may not come in touch with each other. This must be taken into account, because you might end up blocking yourself.

---

Changes affecting amount of information:
3) Declination round is a bit different as well. Here you are selecting the next race immediately after you have sent the previous one into decline. However, new conquest has to wait until next round (similarly to Small World). This has an impact on the game because upon selecting your future race you are giving away information to other players and they may prepare for your future invasion. In Small World this information is unavailable to others.

4) Vinci has open scoring. This makes the end game a bit deterministic and boring as it is easy to min-max everyone's moves and play for the desired position.

---

Changes in components and playability:
5) The number of tokens each race has changes according to number of players. This is not an elegant solution because you have a need to remember a number that is not written on the components (i.e. on the race tokens).

6) In Vinci, certain regions have a different base cost for conquering and/or do not grant victory points. You have to be careful to remember all these exceptions when playing the game.

7) When it comes to components, Vinci uses two sided discs in player colour instead of unique tokens for each individual race. This solution does look a bit outdated, but is way much better for the setup and game play as you have no need to look for the right tokens. Moreover, it is easier to see how many points players are scoring each round because you can tell immediately who owns which region.

---

The differences number 1-6 above make Vinci just a little bit clumsy in my book. It is not a big deal but there are more to rules remember and the game dynamics do not favour surprises. However, the difference number 7 has a positive impact on the playability. 

In the end, I must rate Vinci just one step inferior to Small World. But here we are comparing two good games,. Vinci certainly is one and I would be happy to play it anytime.

RATING: 6
Nice game, but it can be awfully mechanical and mathematical - almost like a ship filling up with water, there can be a certain force that just has to go so far and you just know where it's going.  In that respect, maybe part of the fun goes from the game.  And also, these tidal swings go throughout the game, like crashing waves.

Having said that, it's quick, slick, easy to learn and a fair amount of fun.  But there are better Empire games out there!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very fun game, without any chance elements. It got clever mechanics that work well with its theme. The game got wonderful player interaction. It got a bit problems with the bash the leader syndrome, but the result is an near Diplomacy style gameplay, where you dont know who to trust.

RATING: 8
From the Reviews:This game is something I am interested in, variable powers/civilization, since it it reimplemented by Small World perhaps I will change my opinion about small world, (though I like the theme of this game better). Plays in 90 minutes for 3-6. There is a 2-player variant that looks decent
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Intersting game. The use of the dual "characteristics" to define the civilizations is clever, and the need to grow and decline several civs over the course of a game is quite intersting. Not as involving as I'd like, though.

RATING: 5
I have played Vinci a few times now, but don't own it.  I like how it feels more like a puzzle game than a wargame.  Deciding when to decline and storm back onto the map as a new civ is very interesting.

Easy to learn, quick setup.

Only downside is that at the end only 2-3 players are still in the running, and the remaining players can easily affect the outcome (i.e. play kingmaker).

Banning table-talk after 70pts can help with this.

I liked this game a lot.  It was described as Civ. light and I think that is accurate.  It took us about 3 hours for a 4 person game, but all but one person was new to the game and the speed of play increased as the game went on.

Easy to learn, very good mechanics, agonizing decisions throughout especially when to decline.  Would rate it higher, but it has the worst kingmaker problem I have ever seen.  It really ruins the game and I guess I could rate it a "1" for broken.  I'll be kind and give it a 4.

In my humble opinion, this is one if not the best game to play with 3 or more players.  I am salivating to play this game again, and am very hopeful to obtain a copy if it is reprinted.  The variability and historical perspectives that this game provides are wonderful, and I would recomend it to all living board game geeks to give it a try!

Very good conquest game, with simple rules and comfortable playing time and lots of strategy and variation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A civ game without the usual development (progression) of a civ game.  More area control, really.  The trick really is to combine effective usage of the special powers with timely decline of the civ.  Lots of player interaction and push-pull.

There are strategies at work, but they are only in relation to the special powers of your civ, as in the special powers literally [i]define[/i] your civ.  In that respect, it felt somewhat straight-forward and a little boring (i.e., it felt more area control than civ-building).

Not a bad game, but it just doesn't hook me.  I'd play it again, but it's not high up on the list.  Take it or leave it, but don't play with the AP-inclined.

7/08/09:  Okay, I'm not sure why my initial thinking was that this is a civ game.  It's decidedly not.  Much more area control with special powers.  Not a bad game, but it didn't do much for me.  For some reason, I like [GAMEID=40692] a lot more despite there being only a few changes in gameplay.  Leaving my rating of this one at a 5.  Unlikely I'll play it again, particularly since [GAMEID=40692] is available.

I like the idea that the battles are cut and dry, no messy dice or cards to conuse things.  My wife is far more likely to play this than any of the Risk variants I own.  The key to the game is the timing of your civ's decline.  Do you press your luck with the active civ to try to earn more points, or do you grab that nifty new civ with the neat powers so you can make a big splash next turn?  Good stuff.

Actuall game play is quite good, but the game suffers from some serious downtime problems.  We played with 5 players and it was ~20 minutes between turns...

Mind-numbingly boring.  Downgraded to a "2" because after half a dozen plays or so, I just realized I have far better things to do with my time - so why touch this one again?  Absolutely no theme - what civilization are you?  Greeks?  Romans?  Amazons?  Elves?  Plopping down little wooden circles or sitting out a turn while my "civ" goes into decline are not my idea of a good time.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Without the civilisation tiles this would be a simple abstract strategy game which would pall long before the 2-3 hours' play time was up.  With them there's enough variety to keep playing, but it's not really deep--it's just eminently playable mind candy, like those online Flash games.  It's all short-term point-scoring:  a single bad move won't undermine your long-term strategy, because there is none.  Could work well in party situations with players dropping in and out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This could be great game for me, but it has some issues, the tiles are bit unbalanced (at least fortifications seemed a bit too strong) and there is benefit for being the first player.

Another thing is that I personally feel that the civs are recycled a bit too fast. Civilization games need epic feeling and this constant spawning and declining takes something out of it.

Still I like the game and definiately would like to play again.

EDIT: After playing Smallworld I see no reason to play this again as Smallworld is better in every sense. Rating dropped from 7 to 6.

RATING: 6
I have played many different empire builders that are euros, and this one takes the cake for me.  You have a choice over how your empire is going to expand, and when to put it into decline and raise another civ.  This leads to a great game with very tense decisions.

RATING: 7.5
Essentially the same game as Small World but I kinda like this one more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For being an "empire" game of the classic eurocentric model, Vinci is a good design effort. Play flows smoothly, strategies change regularly and moments of key decision-making are numerous enough. Component quality isn't very good, the mapboard seems cramped for the scope of the theme, and anything to do with oceans and seas is pretty much ignored contrary to history. On the other hand Vinci can be played in under 2 hours, it's competitive in that no one is rarely knocked out of final contention, and the bidding system makes risk-taking a necessity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice and not overly complicated. The randomly selected special powers seemed somewhat unbalanced to me, and though there are some measures in place to remedy the unbalance, I think it still favours the players getting first picks. However, the game plays well and is thoroughly enjoyable.

RATING: 10
Haven't tired of this one yet, and suspect I never will.  A little wargaming, a little diplomacy, a little table talk (depending on your group), some leader bashing, some perceived leader bashing, a little Cosmic Encounter rule breaking... and it's all wrapped up in a German game time limit.  Love it.

RATING: 7
Pros:
*) Neat idea
*) Easy to learn
*) No two games are the same because of the random civilizations
*) Can be played for any length of time by adjusting the victory point limit

CONS
*) Especially in short games, a player with a good starting civilizations can get a decisive advantage early in the game (unless all the other players bash him). My advice: Play till 120 or more victory points
*) Not too many exciting decisions to make: When to take a new civ, and which one - that's important! Expansion is pretty obvious once you've played a few games, unless you have to (or wish to) attack another player. Which is why...
*) Rather unexciting with less than 4 players

NOTES
*) Some civilizations are just better than others. The games has a compensation rule, nevertheless the players need to understand the "worth" of civilizations equally well to get a balanced game.

RATING: 8
Great game with a Civ flavour. A really clever system which mimics the ebb and flow of great empires across europe.
Also it's suprisingly simple to learn and not as much of a monster as I had been lead to believe. I really want to play it again!

I like this a lot more that Small World (which uses the same mechanic)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun game. I like how your civilizations rise and then fall into decline, only to be replaced by a new civ. In the one game I have played, it seemed to get rather slow at times, which was annoying since there is little to do when it is not your turn. I imagine my score can only go up with more plays.

RATING: 7
One play, I think I like it pretty well but it's been so long since I've played.  Leader bashing was definitely present.  Lots of opportunity for diplomacy, if your group allows it.  I would like to try it again, but the game doesn't have a lot of fans in my playing groups.  Update: pretty certain I prefer it to Small World.

So far this game is working well as a two-player game for my wife and me.  We play with the three player numbers (8 additional pawns, 150 points to win) and the game usually lasts around 10 or 11 turns.

Solid game that appears at first to be complex but is really quite simple.  The key lies in understanding the civilization tiles.  This takes time.  Game play can be slow at times and will result in long play times.  Game has a nice feel to it - a real ebb and flow to the rise and fall of civilizations.  Scores are close despite the various civilization combinations.  Worth a dedicated effort to play to conclusion.  [GTI Code: TGSL]

A 2 hour civ game.  The jury is stil out for me on this one.  Fun to play, but skill doesn't seem to have as big of a role as I'd like.  Maybe I just haven't figured it out yet.  Need to try with hidden vicory points.  With 3 players the map is very open so there isn't a lot of direct conflict.  With more players map gets tighter.  With five players the map is so busy that it doesn't seem that you have much control at all.  I need to get a better handle on setting myself up so that at game end my civ is in ascension rather than decline.

RATING: 4.5
This is a nice game, where "momentum" is everything. Knowing exactly when to drop your civilization and put it in decline is even more important than deciding which provinces to attack, or how to reinforce at the end of your turn. It's a "shorter" decision (of sorts), but a much more game-defining one.

Ans while attacking others and trying to wait to pick the perfect civilization combo is tons of fun, it also brings along it's own problems: there is certainly some luck in the game, and there is a lot of chaos. If this were a lighter game, it would get a better rating from me, but being as it is, a medium-weight, chaotic game, it gets a solid 7.

From what I understand, a pioneer of each age, nowadays shoved to the corner by Small World, to my mind it still has some of the glamor in all its old looks and simplicity. Nothing fancy as in its successor that is. Not my cup of tea, but nevertheless the fuzz over the kind is well understood.

First play: Having waited a long time to play this one I am not as enthusiastic about this as I hoped. Whilst the idea of unique civilisations needing to focus in different areas is a clever mechanic, the game play seemed clunky in a number of areas; 

There is little point in planning your next move ahead of time as other players will invariably change the layout and your perspective before it gets to your turn again. 

It seems extremely prone to AP, as players finally get their turn  and need to assess their options whilst reviewing the opponants latest changes.

The net result of the above is significant down time between turns.

Bash the leader is an inevitable activity in this game but all part of the demise of an empire.

I wish I was more impressed. Sure it's clever but not a smooth game that encourages a swift second play.

Solid game with a lot of choices to make. Is prone to analysis paralysis esspecially towards the endgame. Still if played competitively players will never be far in front. Theme is pasted on as this a really a very abstract game.

Just liked the streamlined version Small World better. So this had to go. Traded away.

RATING: 9.75
PROS: A very clever civilization-creation mechanic makes every game different. Simple combat rules means low downtime and smooth flow of gameplay. CONS: The non-random combat mechanic combined with  visible VPs make endgame dogpiling and kingmaking a guaranteed thing. OVERALL: I can't seem to get enough of this game. It has the full body flavor of History of the World, with the simple mechanics of Civilization.

House Rules: Last player starts with 10 VPs, each earlier player starts with 1 less than the player after them.
The last player gets first choice of the available civilisations, or may pass.  This proceeds in the reverse order around the table until the first player, who must choose one.  Then, in playing order, each player who has yet to choose one, must do so.

RATING: 6.5
Ebb and flow of civilizations.  Timing (of declines) is crucial, and my timing usually stinks.  Somewhat dry.  Definitely tends to be a leader-bashing game.  That said, I still enjoy it because there are so many 2-tile combinations for Civs, and I haven't "solved" the game yet.  Players are free to add as much diplomacy to the game as they wish.  Going into decline and bringing a strong, new Civ on the board 2 turns before the end seems like a good idea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Easy game to pick up with lots of variety from the civilization tiles - only played once, so far. Notwithstanding hte variety of the tile combinations, 3 of the 4 players in this game finished between 120 and 124 points!

RATING: 7
Vinci is played on a stylized map of nowhere in particular. Players represent Empires, using chits to show what powers they have. Other than the random draw for chits, the game is luck-free, and pretty much entirely math and negotiation based.

I enjoy Vinci a lot, but I'm the only one in my group who is that enthusiastic about it, including the guy who owns it. I eagerly reccomend the game, but suspect that my opinion might be in the minority.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The variable powers and streamlined play are only somewhat let down by the kingmaker problem in the end game. Haven't had a chance to try hidden scoring - fingers crossed it'll improve the situation. Still, nothing like the appearance of a barbarian-bankers combo to lift your spirits...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a "History of the World-lite" game of waxing and waning empires fighting over an abstracted map of Europe. The random pairing of attributes represented by the civilization tiles makes for interesting decisions when choosing emerging factions. Knowing when to put your current empire into "decline" and get started on a new one is key and can be a combination of luck and good timing. The simple mechanics keeps the game moving and the diceless "combat" removes one common element of randomness. If you don't have time to play the real thing, this can be an entertaining alternative.

A common issue you hear about this game involves the open VP scoring track. It is an old arguement and a "name your poison" kind of thing. Open promotes leader-bashing and king-making - closed also promotes leader-bashing and king-making, except you're guessing at which is which. Pick your poison.

The designer reinvented this game as Small World - which is shorter and has more personality but I'm still not convinced it is the better game.

I want to try this again.  I think with subsequent plays my rating may go up.

Oustanding game balance. A little lengthy to play, but such a wonderful finesse of design is rare to find. Very easy to explain and to understand. Good thematics for the imaginitive with civilisation coming and going spreading dying and so on each with its own character. The system for choosing civilisation traits is hard to understand the finesse of when reading about it, and even hard as you start your first game. But by the time you've finished that first game it has revealed itself as very simple and elegant and well balanced!

RATING: 4
(1 play) My first game of Vinci left me feeling somewhat lukewarm about it. There are a lot of things which seem to be great ideas: randomly emerging civilising attributes, declining one's exhausted civilisation and picking a new one, the deterministic combat system... But for me they didn't add up to a great game (and losing bitterly in my first game doesn't help, so I'm sure that I am biased). Therefore I should give this one another go as soon as possible, because there still might be a great game in there.

Love the special powers of each civilization, and the whole cycling of empires is a really neat game mechanic.  Much of the game boils down to the decision of when to let go of one civilization to begin a new one.  Really cool game!

The only problem with this game is that the Small World reworking is more enjoyable to play, so Vinci will almost never see the table again!

RATING: 9
It is a must have if need a game to bridge the gap between classic-style Wargames and Eurogames: It captures the flavor of a Wargame and wraps it up in a neat Eurogame, with a low downtime if players think ahead a bit (which they can due to the low luck influence). The rules are pretty simple, and overall it plays much faster than a classical wargame (90min-120min depending on the number of players, including explanation). 

Wargamers should opt for [GAMEID=224] instead. History of the World features Chits, Dice, Special Rules, increased playing time and much more historical Accuracy, but is otherwise quite similar in flavor. I wonder whether the creators of Vinci already knew History of the World.

I still prefer Vinci over its successor Small World. Vinci offers more strategic depth, but is only a little more complicated.

[u]October 2008:[/u] I loved the game from the moment I read the rules. I haven't played a lot yet but I really want to play a lot.
[u]Nov 2008:[/u] The game is really dynamic and is all about tempo.

[u]June 2009:[/u] I downrated this from 8 to 7.5.
Why? because in my 3 last games with 3p, the player who got diplomacy was unbeatable. I guess that it loses power with more player but here, we never could see how to stop him. Of course, maybe we should have sacrificed a bit more to get the civ, even though it was a bit early... but still
Apart from that problem, I really like the game, it plays fast, has good decision making. As I said, the game is about tempo, you want to have the best civ. And this is not about chance, it's about sacrificing a few good turns of your actual civ to get the right tile, or sticking with it a wee bit longer to avoid giving away tons of points. I still really like that aspect of the game.
Though I'm wondering about maybe buying Small Workd and getting rid of this one as apparently Small World would play well with 2 and better with 3 than Vinci. Moreover, the fantasy theme, though a bit goofy, gives it a little of appeal. Vinci is pretty dry after all.

RATING: 8
When I first played this game, I was seated so the map was upside down to me.  It took me about half an hour to realize that it was actually a map of Europe.  >.<

It's quite interesting and somewhat unique in that both the rise and fall of one's civilizations are important; a key to the game is knowing when to put an old civilization into decline and bring in a new one.  Since players don't hold onto the same chunk of land and the same abilities, gameplay and strategies can constantly change.  The tempo of the game can vary greatly from game to game due to the properties of the different civilizations that get pulled.

One complaint is that one player can run away with the lead from the beginning by building very strong early civilizations, but in one game where people were particularly intent on griping about this, the player who was in the lead for most of the game got beaten at the very end.

RATING: 6.5
This has the feel of a civilization building game, but streamlined in the extreme. I don't mind the open scoring track, but group dynamics are going to dictate attacking the 'leader'.  The combat and the civilization selection are both features I enjoy.  I doubt this game will sate anyone's appetite for Civilization, but it is a nice change of pace from less confronational Euros.  

Unfortunately, I never could really get to feel comfortable about the game end. Either we should have used hidden scores...or something. Because it just seems to turn into an issue of getting a little lucky as the leader keeps getting clubbed during the last few turns. If you happen to nudge ahead at the right time you'll win, but you may not feel like you played any better than the rest of the players. However, I enjoy the gameplay otherwise.

I really enjoy the way the empires bonuses are created. This is a excellent lighter multiplayer wargame. There is also room for a little or a lot of negotiations which is something I like. This is true in many multiplayer games. But, multiplayer wargames for obvious reasons stand out because who you attack so dramatically influences their position. Therefore, the negotiations are more critical to your outcome. Be forewarned.

Its okay - the different and random combination of abilities for empires, plus the decline rules mean it has more replay value than most games of similar types. But it still suffers from 'gang up against the leader' syndrome - timing your end run is extremely important, and the fact that some powers are much better than others. Some of the rules are silly - fortifications behaving like flat pack mountains for one and for my tastes at least it's just a bit too light.

Vinci has been on my 'to get' list for quite some time (light civ-building games with 'manageable' luck hold my interest), but as I was looking for a French edition to avoid translation errors which plague Descarted Éditeur/Eurogames productions, it took a while for me to find it. Vinci looks deceptively simple, but is in practice much more cerebral, for it takes a while for the rules to sink in. It also takes longer to play than I expected; both factors make teaching the game hard, as you have to explain at least [i]some[/i] of the civmarkers a few times. On the other hand, they also make the game appealingly replayable: literally, no two civs are alike. The game's mechanics are straightforward and elegant, if not original. The subject has been abstracted considerably, but the ebb and flow of the decline and fall of civilisations is remarkably well-presented nonetheless. However, with the wrong people (not used to a lot of information, or prone to analysis paralysis) this game will fall flat and take too long. 

There is a certain leanness to the entire game which I find quite appealing. There are no spurious mechanisms in place, so players can concentrate fully on the game instead of doing things properly. This is offset somewhat by at times quite brutal luck of the draw, when someone picks a civ which works exceptionally well—and thus can be reeled back in only with great difficulty. However, this doesn't marr the game in any way. With fast players this is a challenging game which goes over quite well in the large majority of cases.

Over the years, this old dinosaur has been given an overhaul in the form of Smallworld, and it pleases me considerably that that game has made quite an impact, to the point where it can be had in a Dutch edition too. I feel little need to own Vinci's offspring since there aren't many differences... But still, the game was deemed good enough to be brought back into production by a popular publisher. [i]Yay![/i]

[b]Update[/b] While a fun game to play, the game is fairly linear in execution as it is mostly about cleverly min-maxing one's civilization. Vinci's spiritual successor Olympos actually contains a bit of [i]game[/i] in this regard, and so with some regret I've decided to drop the rate a bit. It does remain a very solid title, though... undoubtedly because the mechanisms are so terribly efficient what they need to accomplish.

May 2008 - BGG Purchase.  Have a hard time with the online implementation and would like to play this F2F.

2010 - Played my first game of this.  Ended in a tie.  Some elements of this edition I like better than Small World.  Especially the visibility of the scoring track.  However, I don't see this being played by my family as much as Small World.  Therefore, sold this one away.

I enjoy this game of civilization building, only with 4 or maybe 5 players.  With more, it seriously drags, and can be fairly random.  The victory conditions could be better--the race to the finish causes some weird endgame problems.  A variable ending might make for a more fun game.

I learned this game on Yucata - and felt I needed to try it as it's the precursor to Small World, one that I really enjoy.

Vinci is going to appeal to the more hardcore strategists out there, and I think if I'd played it first, I would enjoy it more. But after Small World, this feels drier and not as inviting. In particular I didn't like that so many abilities only count when you're in decline, so you have to worry about your decline faction just as much as your active one. SW puts the bigger emphasis on active races, and I prefer that.

So in summary, this is a very solid area-control game, but your playstyle will determine if this is a better choice for you than SW.

I used to like Vinci more (in the 8-9 range), but played it often enough that all the games started feeling the same. Can be fun to play with 3 powers instead of 2 (with 3 fewer units as a base).

We generally play with hidden VPs to avoid final-round kingmaking dilemmas. [Yes, people could keep track mentally, but in practice they're not that accurate. It's casual play.] When I next break it out, I'll propose a Small World-style fixed number of turns, too.

This game is essentially Small world with a little less polish. It plays 6 which is nice, but the game is a little long for my taste. Also, with 6, it's a little too long between turns. It doesn't have the great look of Small World, but it has more power combinations which is nice. I've also considered adopting some Small World rules to shorten the game.

Vinci is the anti-Risk.  That is, it has all of Risk's good points (conquering continents, easy rules), but it avoids Risk's flaws (too long, too many dice, players are eliminated, little strategy).

All the good features of History of the World but shorter, less luck dependent and with easy to grasp rules. I've not yet played this enough to decide if Vinci deserves classic status but it certainly has that potential...[Update: this has had a really good run in my group of late. Some of the group were ambivalent about it a couple of years ago but it's come out almost every week recently and people are still demanding it. It's usurped Antike for the moment as our civ game of choice. A classic in every sense.]

RATING: 7
I liked how the game was so simple but seemed to engineer genuine decision-making with a good variety of simple and difficult choices.

There's multiple viable strategies - you can go up a mountain despite their lack of value to make future invasions easier, hide in forests, pick on the weak or break down the strong. With every possibility there's balanced advantages and disadvantages.

Counting was sometimes a problem for Julia when there were many attack-affecting abilities in play (I cost one extra to be attacked, she used fewer to attack under certain situations and mountains/forests complicate everything). I think Small World's idea of using cardboard to represent mountains is wonderful.

Lesson: even when all the units being added or subtracted are '1', arithmetic can be complicated when there are tens of variables to be remember and count up.

Towards the end, everyone was getting a bit tired and though I kinda enjoyed it during the game, the length would put me off replaying it. I suppose that's a sign that for me too shorter would be better here.

I look forward to trying Small World myself and properly comparing.

This is simply a beautiful game.

The theme of the game takes a bit of time to wrap your head around, but the mechanics, turn order and strategies are exactly right. A classic European game that has infinite replayability.

The more you play the more you understand the power of the Civilization couplings. It's certainly a game that you can grow with every play. It's similar to Domaine in a way, in that your first few plays may have a runaway leader, but the more you play and understand the subtleties of the game, the better you become at denying your opponents the upper hand. 

As simple as this game may look, it has to be the best European-style game I have played to date.

RATING: 8
It plays out quickly in about an hour, yet allows for many different approaches.  Luck is almost eliminated as a game factor.  The variegated combinations of abilities keep the game fresh.  Also, I've seen players make a big push in the endgame to swing from last to first.  I like games where you have a chance to win right up to the end.  It keeps the game lively for everyone.  It's also fun to try to figure out what a given Civilization might be historically.

Update: I rarely play anymore.  AP has sucked the fun out of the game for me, and Antike has sort of taken over the niche.  I'm docking it a point.  Probably should be a 7, but baby steps first.

Do not mistake Vinci for a wargame.  It's about area control and point maxing.  Fun the way different powers interact: some civs develop fast and burn out, others grow slowly and last.

An excellent game of area control and territorial conflict in a way similar to, but miles better than, Antike.  The conquests and battles are done without any randomness whatsoever, so this is in essence a Euro wargame, but, unlike Antike, a highly dynamic one with the ebb and flow of different civilizations.  The rules are very simple for a game of such depth, so this is in my opinion one of the best games in the area control genre - the only problem I have with the game is that you cannot effectively defend provinces if people gang up on you, but that is a minor quibble.

Many moons ago, one of my brothers brought over this strange game called Vinci.  At the time I was very confused by the concept of the game, mainly because I had only played mainstream games like Risk, Monopoly, etc. which for the most part involved player elimination.  I thought Vinci was a wargame like Risk, and was very confused at the lack of dice and the fact that players could control multiple civilizations throughout the course of the game.  I did not like Vinci at the time, but playing Smallworld and Imperial 2030 reminded me of this game.  I hope I get another chance to play Vinci.

RATING: 9
Oof.  This game is amazing.  With the variable civ powers, you really don't need to ever own another war game.  But it is _too_perfect.  Without dice, there is no emotional release valve for having something bad happen to you.  Every setback is someone else taking the cold blooded calculated decision to wipe you out.  So like T&E, this has to lose a point for being very emotionally draining.  It isn't fun, it is awesome.

RATING: 8
I enjoyed it quite a bit regardless of its bash-the-leader tendencies.  I actually think the combat is one of its best mechanics.  It rewards action.  Only the defender loses tokens!  Excellent.  No turtling can take place.  The civ tiles are well done as they lead you to your optimal strategy.  Defending spaces on the boards puts a lot of questions in your mind.  Do I defend a lot of spaces a little or one space a lot?  Some real tradeoffs are placed on the player here...which I like.  I don't think I've played anything much like it.  If I had to compare it to another game, it is most like Wildlife.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very good "civilization" type game set in Europe. Players play generic tribes that "invade" Europe. Each tribe has two abilities that allow them special powers. Combat is simply a matter of committing enough pieces to conquer the attacked region. Players score points for regions conquered, and quite often the abilities will grant bonus points for specific areas taken. A key decision during the game is to put your current tribe into "decline", which means you can begin a new tribe up, while still earning points from the old one. Great game, always seems close, some nice decisions to be made, and only takes 90 minutes. Strongly recommended, and get the second edition.

More abstract wargame with varying combinations of civilization attributes, which is the best part of the game.  Fun decisions for which civ to pick, when to decline your civilization, and where on the map to enter with new civs.  Genericness of the system and map is a downside.  A bit too repetitive in the sense that players usually enter the map in the same areas (mountains) due to the terrain advantages.  Feels too optimizable and deterministic for a wargame--there are definite “best choices” if you can number-crunch through the point scoring alternatives.  It's missing a good "push-your-luck" type of tension.  Also seems too long (4 hours for us, in 6 player game)—its advantage should be that it is much shorter than other wargames.

Vinci is a good game. Vinci reminds me a little of Civilization (AH version without the trading cards). Main differences is that Vinci playes a whole lot faster,which is good a thing. I also enjoy the fact that Vinci has no dices in this game. Victories are automatic if you pay the required tokens to win.

Deciding when to put your civilization in decline is interesting decision to make during the game. Timing is important.

I would want to play the game again sometime soon. Looking forward to my next game.

There are lots of civilization combo's that can happend in Vinci. Some combo's are more interesting than others. With more games played, you get an idea on what is good and what is so so.

Played Vinci in WBC 2008 tournamet. I was leading the whole until the last two turns which I get my territoires cleaned out by the the other players. Not planning to play Vinci again tournament wise any time soon. I had a bad experience of bash the leader.

I bought this in 2001, we played it a few times, but it just didn't take hold.  Recently had the chance to play it again under the ideal conditions--with someone who knew it well and loved it.  Glad to try it again, but I've decided it's just not my cup of tea.  It's a little Risk-y, which always bores me.  And maybe the scale is just a little too epic to hold my interest.  I'd rather have one civilization and get to know it and improve it and become attached to it, than have constant turnover of different ones.  Not a bad game, just not for me.

* Played 10+ times. Do you like the idea of Risk, but hate the 5 hours duration and the player elimination? How does 90 minutes and unlimited 'restarts' sound? Throw in that each players 'nation' has distinctive abilities, and you have the makings of a really good game. Think Risk for quitters. I really like the ebb and flow of the game. There is strategy to who to attack and where to occupy the board to frustrate opponent's plans. And when things are going badly for you, abandon your nation (it'll still score you points until conquered), then grab a new set of abilities, and bring a new civilization into being! I think it's begging for some new civ abilities and additional maps!) [o-s-o-tr-o.]

Quite good relatively short game, with an attractive board.  Some skill, but success can depend on whether other players choose to attack you.

RATING: 7
i like it a lot, but it has 2 big weakness:  public scoring makes for king-making, and the random initial civilizations makes for an unbalanced beginning.  these 2 counteract each other somewhat, but they're still not fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice alternative to heavier civilization games.  Can be played in less than 2 hours if players keep the analysis under control.  End game suffers from huge kingmaking possibilities so we play with a borrowed game ending variant; Evo has a variable game ending die roll which keeps a fair measure of drama.  It doesn't solve all the problems but it removes the certainty of the timing of the final turns.  Interesting combos in the civ powers forces tough choices.

After only a couple of plays I can tell that Vinci is going to be one of my favorites.  I like the the treatment of empires and the passing of time as well as the risk like map.  It hits a wargamey note for me and seems clean and simple as well.  My play group really enjoys it.  I think this is a very creative game.  It's a game I think about for days after I play it.

RATING: 6
[Euro-wargame] [5P:5, 4P:6, 3P:5] Vinci touts itself as a game about "the rise and fall of civilizations," which is a pretty spot-on description of the game. Considering the scope of what it attempts to represent, the theme is abstracted to a high scale. Despite that, the theme still manages to shine through, partly due to the stylized map and partly due to the civilization advantages. The civ selection mechanism is interesting, if not original. There are enough civs to make the game quite replayable. In fact, my interest in the game is driven by wanting to see the civ interactions in play. Vinci plays suprisingly quickly for a luckless game. 150 minutes? The heck? 90 is more like it with 4 players. (Don't try it with 5 or 6; the game really suffers from chaos, lack of control and downtime. With 3 it's too loose; the map is too big. It's all just right with 4. This is one of the game's faults. Well, join the Eurogame club. Puerto Rico is the same way.) Finally, the game defaults to open scoring. There's a lot of grousing over this "Kingmaker syndrome" thing, but since I don't believe in "kingmakering,", I say it's a non-issue (feel free to disagree). The Descartes presentation is spartan, but of pretty good quality. The board is linen and colorful, but a couple of terrains might have been set off a bit more. What's with the civ display being smaller than the tiles? The army markers are your run of the mill colored discs. The counters a thin, but at least they're linen-finished. Overall, it's a game I'd recommend for anyone to take a look at.

Very clever and original civilisation rise and fall game - but not so much a civ building exercise in the traditional sense.  Lot of fun to try and name your "civs".   Could have been a 10 if the scoring mechanism could be tweaked to avoid king making.  Ugly board too

A very fun little strategy game.  The random Civ powers make it a new challenge each game.  Some feel the end game drags, but I haven't really had that problem.  I replaced the boring euro wood bits with plastic figs from AH History of the world and that really makes it pop!  If you are looking for a new strategy game and are tired of Rish and A&A here's an easy trade up that will be played often!

The predecessor of the now ubiquitous Small World is a pretty solid design. Not clinging to a single civilization for the entire game is a nice change from your standard civ fare. The random civilization powers can sometimes make the game a tad imbalanced and it occasionally suffers from kingmaking in the endgame.

Update: After having played Small World, that does all the same things but better.

I realize the idea of a fast paced civilization game sounds like a cruel lie, but Vinci pulls it off beautifully, charting the rise and fall of ancient empires.  You and your neighbors all take turns selecting randomly selected pairs of powers for your civilization and then fight over territory.  There's an ebb and flow to the game, where sometimes the power sets you choose will be completely devestating and sometimes they just won't work nearly as well as you'd hoped.  Fortunately, if you do get a combination that isn't working for you, it only takes a turn to go into decline and jump right back in again.  Loads of fun and you're done in an hour and a half or so.

I've raised my rating of this game from first impressions. I use hidden scoring which certainly speeds up the end game. I usually play it as a 4 player game so that down time is minimized.

The interesting civ combos that come up make up for alot.

Rating based on 1 game. Promising game, looks simple at first sight, but don't underestimate it.

There are a lot of games out there with building and expanding upon your territory.  This is the only game I am aware of where you cycle through civilizations and you have to decide when to abort your current civ to start a new one on the next turn.  I love the aspect of timing in this game, and the varied types of civilization powers that come up.  Overall, this is an excellent game and I look forward to trying it again.

RATING: 5
This game is similiar to History of the World but more dynamic and with no dice rolling.  "More Dynamic" and "No Dice Rolling" might be thought of as good things in most games but for Vinci I have found that they lead this game to have one of the strongest "king maker" potentials of any game.  If you are too far behind to win you can either king make or do nothing much and be bored.  If you are in a multiple  person race for the top spot it often comes down to politicking for players to attack anyone but you.

Some people have stated that Vinci turns into a game of 'whining' and 'choose the winner' at the end. While this is one way to look at it, I prefer to call the whining 'negotiation'. I agree that hidden scoring might perhaps remove some of the endgame analysis paralysis/kingmaker problem. I think people have to realize that most conquest games have an aspect of negotiation to them. If player 1 can convince me that attacking player 2 is better for me in the long run, then more power to them.

RATING: 9.3
Another diceless luckless war boardgame.
It should get a 10 because:
- There's no luck during the turn,
- The civ you pick makes you adjust your strategy and gives a different game every time,
- There's little down time, as you'd better prepare the next move if you don't want to paralyze the game, plus if allowed, it can be fun to influence other players to play a certain way.
But I've downgraded it to 9.3 just because I don't like the lack of balance in the long term. E.g. the leader of the moment will probably get bashed (yep, that's usually me), and won't recover for the rest of the game, while one of the bashers will then jump up so high that he can't be stopped anymore.
I personally prefer games that have balancing mechanisms (like in Power Grid).
Ah, so close to be a perfect game in my eyes!

I traded this away a long time ago, but I occasionally feel the urge to revisit it so I've raised my rating a point.  One one hand, Vinci has a very bland and generic feel, and is way too dependent on getting whacked the least.  On the other hand, it's a game that presents players with a lot of interesting decisions throughout the game.  Best with four players.  The solitaire game is also fun.

[Update] Small World simply blows Vinci away.  It's so much better that I won't be playing Vinci again.  Ever.

This is a very interesting game of civilization building. the fun thing is that it's fast-paced, and most of the time a close call for the winner. It should be noted, though, that this one is a rather abstract civilization game where you don't get to control any resources and trade anything with other players. You only control a military power to conquer new provinces. But the interesting part is that civilization counters give your empire different characteristics and when you think that you can't expand any further, you can declare a decline and start all over again as a new empire!

RATING: 7
Great little risk variant Waro type game.  Special powers for the armies and geographical variation make things interesting- these are the meat of the game and make every turn full of interesting decisions.  Downtime goes by fast as you watch what the other players do to plan your attack.  The civ comparisons are really dumb- if this is civ then playing risk ten times in a row is civ.  There is no civ building, but you take control over new armies from time to time and that is supposed to represent the rise and fall of civilizations in the game.  It feels pretty thematic, but don't come here looking for civ light!  

The game is highly interactive and the theme is executed pretty well through the special powers for the civilizations.  Vinci is a really good game, I am looking forward to DoW's reprint.

If I had complaints, it would be that it drags on a bit at the end when you already know who has won.  I suppose close games are possible, but you could end a close game at 75 points and it would be just as tense as ending it at 100 points.  This is so easy to house rule it isn't really a complaint at all.

Update:  There is ZERO reason not to get small world!

This is almost an abstract, rather than a weurogame.  

Because of the detrministic cost-based expansion, the moves and holds have to be logically based, and sooner or later the # tokens approaches the number of territories on the table.

Selecting the righ time to decline and start a new Civilization is a key, perhaps the key to success in Vinci.

Based on one solo 3-player play, I am starting Vinci at a 6.5. 

I had some questions about the Civ tile for Currency; because especially for a 3-player game it basically broke the scoring engine- if I played it correctly. :-)

Never the less this is a good game with lots of interesting choices.

I like this more than Small World - but that's not saying a lot!  Decisions seem very straightforward.

[q="Sandy Petersen"]
1) Choosing Civs - you can pick any two adjacent tiles. Each tile you skip gets 1 victory point on top of it. Thus, if you pick the 4th and 5th tiles from the left-hand side, you'd pay 3 VPs for it, since you are skipping 3 tiles. When you pick tiles with VPs on them you only get the VPs for those tiles. 

This is simple and effective and permits us to fiddle with our civs a bit. I remember in one forum a player opined that perhaps this would remove the soul-searching that takes place when choosing a new civ, but trust me, it doesn't. :cool:

2) Game Start - we too had noticed the problem with the last player getting hosed for civs. So at game start (only) the last player to go gets to pick his starting civ first. This follows all normal rules - i.e., if he skips some tiles, he pays victory points, etc. Then the second-to-last picks his civ, and so forth around to the first player who is stuck with whatever civ tiles are left. Often he actually gets bonus points because some civ has been skipped. 

We've discussed saying that you don't get bonus points for your first civ but haven't implemented. 

3) Old Civs - this might even a a rule (haven't read the rules for years). But when a civ goes decadent, its tiles don't go back into the bag. This means that once we've seen two Diplomacy tiles, for instance, we know there are none left. it also means we have less repetitious play. [/q]

RATING: 5
A 'civilization building' game that consists of moving round disks across a map, i.e. it's VERY abstract. The special powers of the different empires aren't fair or balanced, you are arbitrarily picked on by others and once you fall behind there's no catching up. It also goes on far too long for such a dull, dry game. Small Worlds is much, much better.

RATING: 7
An excellent game of civilisations rising and falling. Some very neat ideas and I love all the different powers. Only real problem is the kingmaking in the final turn.

RATING: 8
I liked this game more than I expected to.  I liked its fluidity--you can move on from civilization to civilization, and your board position can change dramatically from round to round, since you have the freedom to pick up your pieces and move them somewhere else.  The civilization powers are very important and I suspect knowing when to pass on one is the difference between an experienced player and a neophyte like me.  Combat is very simple and deterministic--helps keep the design clean.

Don't get suckered into being the person who attacks the leader.  (1 play)

Gioco veramente eccelso se fosse un ramo di produzione attivo arriverebbe al 10 in quanto gli unici difetti sono la grafica un po' spartana (ma molto funzionale), l'uso di un'unica mappa ufficiale e le combinazioni di tessere civiltà che prima o poi finiscono. L'unico forse difetto che non riguarda questi aspetti è la durata che ne sconsiglia l'uso ai neofiti ma qui ci si può adattare. (ITA)

RATING: 7.5
A neat low-level wargame come area-control game with a simple, elegant mechanism for randomising each new tribe that arrives on the board.  It's a race to get the victory points and issues of timing are far more important than gaining/holding areas.  Just when to decline a civilisation is MUCH MORE important than taking an extra port area.  Get the timing wrong and your left short at the final count.

I'd quite like to lower the count a bit and have everyone play another complete round before the game ends.  It would amount to the same thing, but give a better feel to the endgame.

Good game.  HAve only play 2 times so far.  I like the theme of rising and falling empires, though treated very abstractly.  Length of the game is about right, and feels like a medium weight eurogame along the lines of China (Web of Power).  So far have not run across the heavy kingmaking yet, though I can wee where that can occur.

I've played this one twice and I'd have to say that there seems to be slightly too much down-time. Also I think that playing with hidden-points would enhance the game, removing he kingmaker effect. (And adding excitement, 'cause you don't see that you'r not gonna win.)

Un juego que se queda con lo mejor del Risk (conquistar, combatir y reglas sencillas) y deja atrás lo peor (excesivas tiradas de dados, mucho azar, eliminación de jugadores). Trata de escoger civilizaciones con diferentes características, expandirlas y cuando ya han dado de sí todo lo posible... comenzar su declive para escoger otras. La mecánica del "declive" y la del combate (calcular si te llegan las fichas o no para conquistar lo que piensas) son su esencia. Peca de dos fallos importantes: el "descabezamiento" del líder (todos van a por él) y el que en algunas circunstancias se dan situaciones de "Kingmaker". La solución es muy sencilla: emplear PV's ocultos para que nadie sepa quién gana.

Mixed impression after first game (with 6 players): there are some very interesting mechanics, but its a little dry and a touch too slow. There were some more serious problems - a crowded board meant that almost any move by a player impacted negatively on some other player, and this particularly facilitated "kingmaking" at the end of the game. However, the game may work better with fewer players.

After several plays this game gets knocked down a few points. It had immediate appeal that dwindled with repeated plays. We found it dry and lacking in any real surprises, which is a fatal flaw in any "conquest" style game that our group plays. After the first few turns everyone's moves seemed obvious. Finally, bashing the leader, which I don't mind in most games, is a significant issue here, mostly because it's so easy. Traded it away and have not looked back.

Civilization-building in Europe in antiquity. I was very enthusiastic about this game at first, and our group played it lots of times. However, with time it became appearent that the game is *only* about diplomacy and whining, and everything is decided in the last turn or two...

RATING: 7.5
God, I keep changing my rating on this...up then down, then up, then down....It's good; I just can't decide HOW good. I think it works pretty dang well on whole, it's got great replay value, it's pure strategy, it's a good Euro-ized civilization/expansion game, but you don't really develop your civilization, you just expand it or collapse it...you need timing.

All said, I think it works well, but I don't long to play it...however, when I do, it's pretty good.

I do think an end game alternative is needed...I lean towards the "Evo" solution (roll in each of the last number of turns).

Why? It can devolve into a wicked kingmaking, leader bashing, contention when you have the lead.

With the fix, you still have a wild fight on your hands, but it's not over the top. 

You want that fight. Isn't this called competition? Shouldn't you have to fight for your victory? Or, do you want a cake-walk?

Relatively quick playing Civilisation game, unlike more famous examples of the genre. Some nice mechanics. 1. You run two civs at a time - one active (i.e. you can continue to expand it), one in decline (i.e. static and unable to defend itself). Choosing the right time to put a civ in decline and start a new one is key. 2. When choosing a new Civ, there's a nice trade off between cost to buy and desirability. Small point: it's possible to have a good point-scoring active civ in a safe place on the board whereby on your turn you just twiddle your thumbs and watch the points come in without doing much - a lucrative but not exactly enjoyable approach!

My only complaint is that it is a little too easy to leader bash and often the game comes down to timing your final run for the finish.  Love the ebb and flow of the empires and the many different combinations of empire characteristics.

The war game for non-wargamers.  Call it an expansion game or an exploration game as you will... at its heart it is still a game of conflict.  Simple rules, like the bidding for special powers, make this game  a great 'transition' game for the hard-core wargamer to Euro-style games.

Having liked History of the World I picked up Vinci in the hopes it would play as a shorter version of HotW. I feel that it does just that as civilizations expand and decline over time. I do feel that there are endgame problems but we'll figure something out that will make us happy.   

Well we solved our problem regarding the end game. We decided to go with hidden scoring and play to the points stated in the rules. So each player kept track of their own score on a piece of paper and when a person equaled or exceeded the required points they showed their score. Then any remaining players took their final turn and the game ended. It made for a much more interesting and quicker game, as each player looked to maximize their own score. And no, the rest of us did not write down our opponents scores during the game...that would be lame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like Vinci. I have problems with Vinci, but I like the game.

The pleasures? The game is entirely original and plays like no other (excepting the re-implement Small World, of course). By combining two randomly selected tiles to define your civilization, your strategy for the next few turns is also defined. I like how variable the size, placement, and scoring can be between civs. The 2nd edition is nicely designed with a clean, playable look. Timing your declines are key in-game decisions that are sometimes nicely challenging to execute well. 

The pains? The game has no arc. No beginning, middle and end. You start and end civilizations one after the other without really any connection between them. You pretty much pick an arbitrary point total to end the game at, depending on how long you want to play. This has the effect of having you go, "Neat!" at the end of the game, but with no real sense of gamerly satisfaction.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very solid entry in the History of the World kind of game.  Not really a 'civilization' game, because its a bit abstract and your civs won't develop and will die a few times.  Crucially, lacks technology and trading but its fun.  Note that Small World has superseded this in every way.

RATING: 6
This and Smallworld have a lot in common. There are 5 main differences here:
1) Your civilization must be connected at the end of an expansion turn. 
2) When you go into decline you immediately choose your next race, but you don't expand with them until your next turn.
3) Terrain types have varying costs of entry. Mountains, deserts and river spaces do not earn any points. Furthermore, it costs one less to conquer a space adjacent to a mountain you occupy. 
4) The number of tokens you get for your civilization depends on the special ability tiles, but also on the number of players and this fixed amount depends on the map you are playing.
5) Your active civilization cannot exist adjacent to your declined civilization. If they become adjacent you must remove those declined civilization tokens from the board.

It's clear why DoW streamlined some of these rules. However, the rule about needing to remain connected is very interesting and can lead to very different strategic decision points. I also personally really like choosing your next race immediately, it removes a bit of chance.

I prefer Smallworld. Conflict in Smallworld is typically more cost effective than Vinci because Vinci has terrains that earn zero points. These can disincentivize movement towards an opponent. Games with fewer players suffer as well due to the lack of scaling in the maps.

the end conditions are horribly broken, but there's a simple way to fix it: play to a random score, e.g. 75-126. take a deck of cards and shuffle it; at the end of every turn, flip over a number of cards equal to the difference between the high score and the previous turn's high score (if it was over 75). the winner is whoever is ahead when the ace of spades is flipped up.

Pretty good as far as light wargames go, and almost revolutionary when it came out. The civilization special power selection and the decline mechanism were really cool at the time (and still pretty good).

Suffers from being too slow unless everyone is tightly focused on playing quickly rather than optimally, and having massive kingmaker problems in the endgame.

I think this has many of the same problems as Smallworld: it requires leader bashing for balancing, but this will devolve into extortion, kingmaking and random outcomes. Though I can't say it's the better game in every aspect, at least Vinci feels more upfront about what it is, allowing and encouraging players to play the game instead of sort of play at playing and then find out at the end what happened.

RATING: 3
This game continues to burn me, and I have had enough.  I love the mechanic that pairs the 2 abilities to make a civilization - and I like that the bad ones get passed at the expense of the other players until it gets valuable enough to pick.  But that is all I like.  The simple spread your civ to its limit then decline focus of this game makes for uninteresting choices that are almost entirely motivated by stopping the leader(s) and/or maximizing your own score based on your abilities.  Non-strategic, highly tactical spreading leads to a sort of leap-frog effect along the score track that creates the illusion that it is a tight, close game.  It isn't.  Every player is just doing what is obviously best at any given time and so everyone is always doing roughly the same.  A game's ability to keep my score marker next to my opponents for a long time without me needing to commit any thought to keeping it there is completely uninteresting. Because of the neat mechanics described at the start - I would LOVE to love this game.  Sadly, I can't, because of my genetic predisposition to dislike games that suck.

This is not a game I'd ever be eager to play, but I'm always willing to play if others want to.  I always feel like there aren't quite enough viable choices during the game.  The starting positions matter a great deal, and the endgame seems to favor some players over others.  Still, I've had a good time in the sessions I've played (although I've never won).

Bought second hand from France. Arrived slightly beat up, please use an external box when shipping your games, not just bubblewrap over the game box!

The second edition is well worth finding, if only for the revised mapboard art. It looks so much better. As to game play, no differences. Vinci is still one of the best two hour-six player-variable powers-light wargames around. Still, I know Civilization, and this, sir, is no Civilization!

UPDATE: Raised to 8.5, after a wonderful & quite even session, where pacing was everything. And it looks like it is possible to come back from an early mistake, as the others take turns getting whacked as the perceived leader. Not to mention I won a copy of von Mansteins memoirs. Kudos to Håkan for donating the price!

RATING: 7
Excellent and relatively quick empire-building and declining game in the same vein as "History of the World". Very quick and combat is never left to chance. Accomplishes in quick and simple brushstrokes what other games require many rules to establish.

This, in my opinion, is the most polished and playable of the various "civilizations rise and fall" category of games, including Civilization, Advanced Civilization, History of the World, and Sid Meier's Civilization. It doesn't quite have the same depth of detail or strategic options, but mechanically and thematically, it's very, very good.

Small world made this game irrelevant... Some people maintain that Vinci has redeeming qualities when comparing to Small world. They may be right, but vinci is still way behind Small world. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Having now played this a few times, I've increased this rating from a 6 to a 7, and now I'm raising it to an 8. I think the rather clever concept of wanting to decline civilizations as they become less profitable to the player is extremely unusual, almost like a reward for failing! Thematically, too, it is intriguing to think of history as being an ebb and flow of various civilizations over time.

EDIT: Having played Small World, too, I think that it's a wash as to which is better. That one is a little better balanced, what with the two different types of traits (races and powers), but the cartoony fantasy theme isn't as appealing to me as the pseudo-historical theme of Vinci, mainly because the artwork is too busy, like a kid's TV show.  Also, the increased variability of this older edition is the good kind of crazy -- every so often, you'll draw double-Barbarians or somesuch, which really changes the values.

A strategy game with 0 dice and luck ? Sign me in. 

Unfortunately, the realistic map reduces the replay value of the game because a given civilization power will almost always decide where you play on the map. 

Smallworld fixed that, with a lot more mixing between region types, but it simplified the game too much (and added some luck elements !) Vinci is still much better.

Distills the area control of classic Civ and the coming and going of civilizations from History of the World to a functional two hour bare minimum. So far I like it a bit better than Smallworld.

RATING: 7
For the diehards this is a better game than Small World. Small World with its fantasy theme has definitely increased the ability for expansion sets, however I think I prefer Vinci, for starters there is less bits to get out (Small World has so many fiddly extra bits that at times i find it quite irritating), secondly in play you get to choose at least 4 combinations to add variety to the game, I find that with Small World there are several combinations that you can sit on from start to finish. Yes Vinci is not as colourful, yes it only has one board, but for its eveness Vinci is the better game in my eyes.

This has really taken the backseat since Small World got out.

I played twice in a row for the first time with 3 other people who had never played before.  We all thought that it was a fun game.  It was a little fiddly, with all the tokens and chits to move around, and I kind of felt like it was history of the world-lite, but overall I enjoyed it.  Would be interested to try small world now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's really an interesting game, it play fast, there is no heavy calculation to do. The combitation of talents for civilisation is a good idea. The only drawback I seen is that some special powers are not much usefull, civilisations goes up and down too fast, you don't feel like you are develloping your civilisation. I would rather have a modular board than historical map.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I thought it was good and it reminds me of all the "shorter" elements that I like from a Euro-style version of Risk, Civilization, Diplomacy and Cosmic Encounter.  I've grown out of Risk-type games, but playing Vinci reminds me of why I did.  I prefer using the variant of rolling a die to see if/when the game ends (mixes in a balance of uncertainty and decreases the runaway leader issue).  This usually gives lagging players some type of hope in order to possibly catch the leader(s).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A strategic, no luck Risk style game in which you take on the roles of different civilizations with special powers which "break" the rules.  Basically, the knowledge tiles tell you how many armies you bring into play with your civilization and may grant other special abilities.  At some point, you must decide when to place your current civilization into decline and start a new one.  Both will score points although the one in decline potentially scores less since some knowledge disappears when you go into decline.

RATING: 9
I tend to enjoy long-reaching, empire building games, that allow for long-term strategy, but then, use variable elements to create a tactical feel. Much like the calamities in Advanced Civilization, I think the random pairings of the civilizations in Vinci meets this need. However, it's not as seemless as Adv Civ, and really becomes an abstract game, it all becomes a matter of determining where to best position pieces. Also - perhaps the WORST case of leader-bashing -- the game just begs for it! Use a variable ending to avoid this.

EDIT: DoW's Smallworld is a re-theming of Vinci. At a minimum I would use the hidden VP chit idea to avoid the "get the leader" issue (which is an issue in many games in any case). Have gotten some fairly hard core war gamers into playing Vinci.

A good game that's not going to get played now other people have Small World.  Haven't played the sequel, but am reliably informed it's an all-round polishing-up of the mechanics, despite the lazy, piss-poor fantasy theme.

Update: I think the changes to Small World actually make it less strategic and less fun, but no-one else agrees.  I'm just bitter because I kept trying to get people to play Vinci and no-one would, then someone brings out a crappier version with some goblins in and it's everywhere.

3-5p, 150m.  "Much better than History of the World and much shorter."My first play was a rather grueling 4 hour session with 6 players.  There was so much down time between my turns that I had time to walk around and chat with other people in other rooms.  I personally think that 6 players is too much: the board was crowded, and the chaos makes it pointless to pay attention when it isn't your turn because the board changes so much by the time it gets back to you.  The little "special powers" chits are way too small.  Might rate higher with fewer players.

It was pretty good as far as mechanics go.. and the variable powers / changing nations aspect is cool... but I found it to play painfully slow.

A racing game with somewhat clever mechanics. The special powers are very unbalanced, though, which is counteracted almost exclusively through leader-bashing.

With five or six players, this is really cut-throat! Quite abstract but seems like a solid ruleset. Timing is everything as it takes an entire turn to declare your empire 'in decline'. Picking that right moment is the key to collecting points. It definitely would appear that the more players the more lively the game is. Was OK with 4, very good with 5. Our first game with six was excellent, but quite long. Definitely better with more if you have the time.

Small World is comparable, and fun, but I think Vinci is the purer game.

I really liked this game. It is not a true area control even though it does contain some of those elements.

As of 10/18/17 I've played 27 times.

An interesting mix between a German game and a war game.  I greatly enjoyed the games I played, but found one strategy that continually won the game for me.  After that, it lost some of it's luster.

Not bad, but suffers from a hit-the-leader problem and a Kingmaker problem. Large difference in the powers of civilizations too. Smallworld is more balanced and has secret scoring.

Civilization Lite, probably along with Mare Nostrum, the pick of the Civ Lite pack.

There is a lot of the "bash the (perceived) leader" in the game, but if you want to lead, then you have to be prepared to take some hits, but if you want to wait & swoop, you need to be ready to do that or the game will get away from you. Much improved with additional starting territory rules. It plays fast & motors along rapidly to a conclusion.

Virtually the same game as Small World, which has the advantage of nicer bits and (with expansions) a greater variety of special powers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A fun game if players can restrain from overanalyzing. Most of the strategy lies in the picking of the civilization tiles anyway, and choosing the moment of decline. If players limit their braincrushing to those decisions and play out the territorial part of the game a bit faster, Vinci is a joy to play; even if hampered by bash-the-leader and kingmaker issues. Choosing a proper moment to go in decline can sometimes help to create a fog of war around the perceived leadership of a player and mitigate that problem somewhat. Playing with 6 seems to be too much in terms of down time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As close as I'll likely ever get to a wargame.  Fun for 3 and 4, have yet to play with more.

Edit:  Like many games in my household, if it can't play with 2, it gets the boot.  Traded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a great alternative to the much longer (and more complicated) Advanced Civilization game. Very similar to History of the World as well. Aside from the draw of the civilization tiles from a bag, luck is not a factor in this game. It plays fast, is easy to learn, and I've never seen a game that played the same. The game components are nice and sturdy and the rules clear enough to teach the game in 10 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Sort of a cross between risk or civilization and a German-style game. Unique powers for each civilization are great. Lots of fun to play. The end game has a bit of the "king making" problem, but can probably be fixed by bidding for starting player (I havn't tried that though). Now probably obsoleted by Small World.

Normally I really love this sort of thing, but this one doesn't do it for me. Probably the 'combat' system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Better than I expected, but in the end not a thriller.  Uses elements from other (and better) games, and does finish in 2 hours.  The 'grow and decline' mechanism from Barbarian Kingdom and Empire goes maybe too fast, and the Civ aspect is more tacked on.  I do not like the no adjacent to your old civ rule: it makes no sense whatsoever, except as an artificial game mechanism.  Still, easy to learn and play.  Perhaps too much kingmaking in the last moves.

RATING: 7.5
A great solution to the problems in many multi-player conquest games. The board is so crowded that you are always attacking someone while being attacked by someone else, but you start up a new civilisation on someone else's doorstep. Suffers a bit from "beat-down on the leader".

1st Edition; MUCH MUCH shorter than AH's Civilization or Eagle's Civilization. It took a couple of rounds to realize I wasn't playing it properly due to not-so-well-written rules. Not very exciting. A bit repetitive and not all that compelling. 1st Edition is also rather unattractive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is theoretically a wargame (players can attack other players), but it has many characteristics that make it much more fun that a typical wargame.  There is only one type of unit, attack/defense values are all set (and easy to remember), and players can start over with a new civilization as many times as they want.  In fact, it's essentially required to abandon your civilization and start over, which makes the game very fun (your country just got trashed?  Just pick up your pieces and start over in another one; and, in fact, by starting over you'll probably get _more_ points).  The theme also allows for much storytelling during the game (in our first game we had viking hordes, cow armies, and barbarians bent on revenge).  There is a tremendous amount of player interaction; while this is great if you have players who love playing together and can take some trash-talking and trash-dealing, this isn't the game for someone who's feelings get hurt easily.

I've played with open points (100 points wins), hidden victory points, and with tournament rules (semi-random end time).  With open victory points and a set end time the game can devolve into unpleasant king-making, yet with hidden victory points it's hard to know where people stand and thus hard to know who poses the greatest risk.  I currently slightly prefer the tournament rules, where when the first person hits 80 points they roll a die; if they roll a 6 the game ends, if they don't, the game continues.  At 90 points the die is rolled again, but this time a 5 or a 6 ends the game, and so on.  However, the straight open-point rules are good too (as long as the group doesn't king-make anyone).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun but given the choice I'd play Small World. The races just make more sense.

The more games I've had of this the more I realize that there are certain combinations that are just too powerful, they can be game breakingly so in a 2 or 3 player game. It is bad enough to lower my ranking as it does lessen my desire to play. As I said above Small World is a much better version which appears to be more well balanced.

RATING: 3
Only played on computer against bots. Euro-wargame hybrid, which might actually be a problem because wargamers want it heavier and euro-heads want it with less direct conflict. Can't see who I would ever play this with. In the end I'll probably prefer to play Risk, the added layers in Vinci don't really feel worth it.

It sits in some nebulous space of being a euro spreedsheet and a conquest game.  I keep wanting to fight a war, but the game keeps forcing me to make moves based on scoring arbitrary victory points.  You can get far by sweet talking other players, but it doesn't have any diplomacy mechanics to handle this dynamic.

A good multiplayer game of area control through conflict. Much simpler version and quicker adaptation of the game mechanics behind classics like History of the World and Brittania but WITHOUT the dice. Lots of player interaction with interesting strategies driven by the combination of civilzation tiles. Prone to kingmaking, but if players are skilful and cooperate effectively then its usually a tight ending. 6-player drags on for about an hour too long and WAY too much downtime - probably best with 3-4 players.

A really nice light civilisation game with a unique mechanic. Each civ you control (and there will be several) uses civ tiles to represent their skills and traits. The potential combinations make for many varied combinations and makes for a new experience with each play. My favourite civ game that doesn't feature dice rolling for combat. Highly recommended.

RATING: 6
I have a bit of a tragic history with Vinci.  I played it once around when it first came out, and I enjoyed the game, but didn't really play it since then.  When I started trading games for the first time, I saw that I hadn't played it in a while.  So I traded away my almost pristine 2nd edition version.  Flash forward a couple of years, and after hearing about the game on several podcasts, I realize that I have made a mistake.  To make a long story short, I purchased another 2nd edition copy from Korea, and now I have this great game once again.

I really love the combination of the civilization powers, and how you have to evaluate how many victory points you would be willing to give up to take a civ.  There are so many things to consider in just that one decision, and it is only one of several very important decisions.  This is a game with no random combat that still has that feel of variability, which is really nice.

There are certainly things to dislike about this game.  There can be a kingmaking problem, there is definitely a bash the leader situation (whether that's a problem or not is up to you), but somehow the sum is far greater than the parts.  A great experience and a game I'm almost always ready to play.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting war game/eurogame. Players have old empires and new empires. The strength of their new empire is determined by the price they are willing to play; to encourage people to take empires, VPs are added to the stale counters. It was okay, but victory points are exposed, so then it becomes a game of too much VP counting and how to attack. We tried keeping VPs hidden, but then it became a game of perception. Game (and others like it) would rate higher if this sort of problem can be eliminated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Good fun game - best played with a group not given to long periods of point optimisation - that can really kill the game. We've taught non-gamers how to play in 15mins and then had a great game.

This may be the best Descartes Editeur's products but that doesn't say much. Civ-type face-to-face conflict is not my thing. Also the game relies on various special powers that I really don't like. Furthermore, endgame can be very analytical, prone to king-making. I have no desire to play it again.

RATING: 6
Good game originally but now a little out of date by Small World which is more fun and beautiful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The first time we played the game we thought it was broken.  We really wanted to like the game because it sounded so cool, it just doesn't work.  

The rules are very ambiguous; and the biggest problem is there is no way to get new armies on the board other than getting another civilization.  So basically every turn you go into decline and get a new civilization, then conquer as much as you can, then start over next turn.  Very monotonous.  

The rules make it seem like you might keep a civilization for longer than a turn, but we couldn't see how or why, since you get no new armies unless you take a new civilization.

Superb area control game in Civilization's clothing.  Usually finishes in two hours or less.  There are occasional degenerate tile pairings, but it's largely a luckless game.  The bash-the-leader issue has been exaggerated by the unscrupulous anti-Vinci legions.

Comments based on a six player game. Because of the number of armies it takes to break into an area, a civ with a small number of armies is not too useful. The penalty for trying to push someone out of an area is too high to make it worthwhile.  Maybe it's because I haven't played much, but it seems that you tend to simply maximize your turn with no real regard to the other players' positions.

Playing with only four makes it a little better. You really need to understand how pairs of civs go together to get the most out of your turns.

I still don't get it. The last game with five players it was almost a four way tie for first with me aaaaaaall the way back.

A solid game, but dry on mechanics and theme. The map is always the same. Plays best with 4, then 3, then 5. 6 has way too much down time.  

After playing Small World a couple of times I conclude that SW is a simplified Vinci. I can't decide which I prefer.

Jun 2010 - I prefer Vinci. 

The game is a bit samey every time, and there is a lot of down time. You can't plan anything in your down time because the board changes too much.

First play at GS 10 with 5.  Very cool game.  When do you put your civ in decline?  When do you let it ride? 

AP might slow down the game significantly, but that is a trait inherent to players and not the game.  If you had a full complement of people that knew what they're doing and are prepared for their turns- I think this game would be a 9 or 10 experience.

This is the most played BIG game of the last year in our gaming group! A BIG success. I still like to come back to it often! A definitive keeper! Who cares for the Kingmakereffect in this game? In our group...no one!
Update: After playing it again, it is still a great game. But not a 10 anymore! Small World should fill the gap. It still gets a 9!
Update: Wow, when coming back to Vinci after so many years I really can see how the wheel of time has gnawed on the graphics. It IS still a great game, but Small World is much modern in look an feel. So I lower the vote to an 8 and highten the vote for Small World instead! :)

I miss names of the people involved (like, say skandinavians or russians). In the game like it is, you could use any (fantasy) map and not necessariliy one of Europe. Otherwise game is O.K.
Funny thing: This comment is from 2005. Small world does exactly this...

RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: A great game of back and forth. Since the scores are visible, the leader is often chased and fought. Simple rules and some luck based on the cost and choice of tiles when starting a civilization. Very though invoking, but not too much so.

Nice simple Civilization game with lots of variety, because every player can lead multiple empires per game, until he feels they have come to their natural decline. Loads of fun and always different. No good with less than 3 players.

I have not played Smallworld, nut since I love Vinci and don't care much for Smallwords art style, I have no interrest in replacing my copy.

I like this civilization-building game, it's very fluid.  There are lots of interesting decisions about how to grow your civilization, and when to abandon it.  The game presents you with a lot of information right away with all of the different ability tokens, but I have a feeling once you get the hang of it, it's much easier to take in.

One solitare play and I enjoyed it. Very good pricing ($20?) out there means I will be buying this as gifts for friends to introduce. Lovely map, good manual, attractive box. 3/06: Played it 3-player, and game may have been an abberation, but it was annoying in that it was difficult to dislodge the leader, and it seemed that only poor culture choices were available each of my turns, at any price. No doubt chance was against me, but the two I played with were unimpressed, and I have had difficulty interesting anyone in this title. Dropped to 7. This game will get maybe one more chance - problem is going to be that it's stuck in the middle, rating-wise, it'll have a hard time capturing interest with the Puerto Rico, San Juan, Power Grid, etc. phase everyone is in right now. By the time they tire of those and their ilk, this one will be old news.

TRY Sept/04: Playing on www.ludagora.net.  Implemention of army redistribution is painfully long-winded online.

Who can play?  Strategy game for 3-6 players.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this game.  It's a civilization building game, but you follow the rise and fall of civilizations over time - and the game is really quick - yet still feels epic.  The special powers that come up randomly make for constantly interesting strategy decisions.  It's a beat-up-the-leader kind of game, but I like that.  As it turns out, I liked this game far more than any of my friends so I had to get rid of it.

The real draw to this game is having variable abilities for each civilization.  The rules are also simple, which is nice (the long part is figuring out the different abilities).  Battling is easy; no dice are rolled.  We usually take on 3 different civilizations per game.  The game can be played relatively quickly, say 2 hours.  Another bonus is being able to play a solitaire version.

-

Interesting game, which gives you a different feel each time you play with a different group of people. It takes a couple of plays to get familiar with all the special powers of various civilization tiles.

The game's territory-capturing mechanics are very nice - think Risk without the dice!

However, it seems to me in various phases of the game almost always your best moves/options are rather limited or even obvious. This drastically detracts from the game by reducing the decision making factor and therefore the depth. Furthermore, when taking over other players' territories, often times the benefit to you is almost the same whether you take over territories of player "A" or that of player "B". This can result in external factors affecting the gameplay -- thus the question of "Which player do I like the least? I'll take over his territories." This could take the enjoyment out of the game for someone who feels they were unfairly or intentionally targetted.

Reduced rating from 7 to 6.5 after a few plays.

This rates a 7 if playing with hidden victory points (use monopoly money or equivalent).  At the end of a round in which a player has 100+ points, they announce this and that ends the game.  No more kingmaking and much harder to bash the leader because no-one knows.

Seemed to just come down to getting lucky with the civilization tile draws. Yellow kills green, Blue kills yellow, red kills blue, green comes back and kills red, etc. Way too long for what it is. Won't likely play it again, although after one play I like to err in a game's favour.

RATING: 10
Very good empire building game. Not as deep as Britannia or History of the World but flows much quicker. It is about as complex as Risk so it is very easy to teach new players.

This is still a very good game. In my view it is better than its sibling Small World however, Olympos (from the same designer) takes this to a much deeper level. Olympos I'd Vinci with less combat and more civ-building. They play in about the same amount of time.

Played once and enjoyed for what it was. The map colours are terrible (too bright) The game has a back and forth flow to it. If you're a civ fan this is not a serious civilization game because you don't get to keep your civ long. Of course the most fun part of the game is the civilization combo's you can get.

Does provide the feeling of empire building - although it is fleeting as one spends time managing the decline as well (through avoiding contact with the prior empire or through verbal diplomacy to keep it intact).

RATING: 8
Enjoyed this game a lot.  The tile selection mechanism might cause some imbalances but overall the ebb and flow was very interesting. Worked very well as a 4-player contest but be aware you'll probably only get 2 or 3 civilizations total during the game. (Maybe the game should be longer or we should play more cut-throat in order to get more Civs in action.)

In the 3-player game the Diplomacy tiles should be removed. Also, Slavery & Coinage seem overpowered.

Update: Not sure if I've ever played this correctly, I certainly did NOT in our last playing. Need to try again soon.

RATING: 7.5
A good Risk-type game (but without dice) with a medieval period feel to the rise and decline of various nations.  Plenty of options to think about in each turn.

A good area control / empire building game. Uses a similar combat to civilization so the expansion decisions are primarily in the direction to optimize the points you make. The other key point it when to stop milking the current civilization and startup a new one. Since new civilizations can start on any map edge no area of the board is permanently safe.  Very much like the civilization attributes are randomly generated and how the civilizations can become more attractive as they are bypassed.

Another eBay purchase.

Well, I finally played this, but only in solitaire version, To my surprise, it was pretty good. At first I was disappointed that it even tried to represent historical civilizations like Norse or Egyptian but only nameless people with two random characteristics or traits and there was attempt to advance technology over time. But it did give a pretty good feel for the success of a new culture and then its gradual decline until it is superseded by a new one.

But I will need to play against other people to see how it works as a real multi-player game.

Despite the luck-free, deterministic combat and elegant and streamlined rules, Vinci lacks strategic depth and suffers from repetitive play.

The problem is that the empires that players control throughout the game cannot be upgraded or improved. Players simply start new empires once they've decided their old ones are not good enough.

So it's not feasible to focus on one empire as a strategic path. But what about trying to plan which empires to start in the future? Players pick empires in a Showmanager-style draft: There are six available empires at any given time. The first one is free, the second one costs two VP, the third six VP, etc. There are two issues here:

(a) Especially in a game with a lot of players, there is no way to predict what empire choices you'll have later in the game
(b) Because you score about 6-12 points per turn, paying ten VP for a empire (I think) is prohibitively expensive, especially given the fact that those VP you spend end up in another player's score.

So you can't even plan for which empires to use in the future.

This tension, either to squeeze more points from your existing empire or to start a new one, is similar to Bohnanza (whether to try to collect more bean cards of a particular type or harvest them). However, I find Bohnanza repetitive in the same way Vinci is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
This game was pleasant to play.  You begin your civilization by deciding which box you wish to pull chits.  Two chits have been randomly placed in boxes numbered I (one) through VII (seven).  The chits must be taken from the same box.  The chits have been randomly pulled from a bag and have unique qualities representing your civilization and the size of your army.  You then proceed to invade from a sea board edge and after your invasion you may get special points based on the chits and the number of colored provinces you have captured.  Next turn you must decide if you wish to decline your civilization and start a new one.  The declining civilization gathers points until it is invaded and it's provinces taken over.  First person to 120 points ends the game.  Play proceeds until the last person has their turn.

Another solid conquest game. Different characteristics for new civilizations is a real neat idea.

This game has some great ideas and a ton of potential, but it also has the potential to get bogged down by excessive over-thinking.  And since you don't do anything (except watch your civilization get chipped away) when it's not your turn, this can make the game very tedious.  However, if played at a reasonable pace, this is a well-designed game.  Interesting game with 6, but far too much downtime between turns.  Prefer 3 or 4.

Not a bad attempt at streamlining a rise-and-fall-of-civilizations game.  Kingdoms rise, fall into decay, and are cannibalized mercilessly by newer generations of kingdoms.  The decisions were generally interesting, and it wasn't as much conflict and bad-feeling-generation as might be expected for a war-like game.  My only complaint is that I felt a real lack of a story-arc in the game.  Even the very tactical Tigris and Euphrates has monuments and treasures that help differentiate the early, middle, and late game.  In this one, the early game feels just like the late game.  For such a long game (over 2 hrs), this lack of story development makes for a little bit of boredom by the end.

Interesting choices about when to decline a civilization and attempt to move on to the next one, but still more luck than might be apparent in the game (combination of civ tiles, what other players have and what they go after).  The other players can't cover all the bases, so the player who is fortunate to exploit the empty regions of the boards pulls ahead.  Would be better if it could be played in 2 hours consistently instead of 3 hours.

The more I play this, the more I enjoy it.  I started out thinking of it not so much as a civ game, but as an abstract area control game.  Played mostly with the kludgy two-player rules, and thought it was "okay."  But I've been playing more lately with a friend who just loves it, and we just played a 5-player that rocked.  The varieties of different attribute combos are really fun, and when you get a good combo (especially one that no one else appreciated) the satisfaction level is awesome.  Getting to the point where I'd be willing to play this regularly.

Vinci is not a game about the history of Europe. If anything it is a game to illustrate the author's theories about empires and their inability to last. Regardless, I *love* this game. Not only is it a fun game to play with family and friends--it's also a great solitaire game. The combination of simple core mechanics with easy to implement special abilities really works for me. It also helps that you change abilities throughout the game.

Big kingmaker problem, but you have to plan for that and factor it in - coming from behind becomes an art form. Still, prefer to play with open scores - that's all part of the game. Quick, simple and a good challenge. I've never had a game where we had to worry about whining players - but this game might play nicer if table talk is discouraged. There are a lot of overblown civilization games out there with their fiddly mechanics - for a light civilization experience this is better.

I'd still prefer to play this over Smallworld any day. Orcs and goblins are of little interest to me themeatically.

An interesting game in concept, but I have found that the game will grind to a halt during the last turns as each move is analyzed and re-analyzed.  The kibitzing becomes very painful at that point as well.  I would only play again with time limits on moves and maybe hidden victory points, still I prefer a lot of other multiplayer games much more.  

Another thing that bothers me is that all combats have a predetermined outcome, so there is no doubt whether you will win or not.  This just adds to the analysis paralysis since you can truly optimize a move. A little uncertainty is a good thing and adds to a game.  So another good house rule would include some combat dice.  

This game is often compared to Rise and Fall, which I would much rather play than Vinci.

RATING: 8
I like Vinci a lot. I love how the game creates unique civilizations by the pairing of two different bonuses, and then watching how uniquely the combination plays out. And I love the "bribe" mechanism used to select civs and tempt folks to pick the weaker ones. Just nicely done. Very interesting. The decision of whether or not to decline your civ and start a new one is always agonizing. The end game mechanics are a little strange, but fair.

RATING: 5
Much more elegant form of Risk. The more abstract nature, with wooden discs and fictional empires, does not detract at all from the perpetually awesome goal of world domination. Features two very clever mechanisms: mix-and-match tiles to guarantee interesting and new empires every time you play; and paying VPs to get better empires, which guarantees all these mix-and-match empires start with appropriate handicaps, and will be equally utilized. The second mechanism is especially elegant, taking game balance out of the designer's hands and placing it on the players.

Don't really see me playing this anymore though. Small World boasts better game design, artwork and is streamlined better.

A little dry, but overall a nice, short, abstract board game that fits into the same category as History of the World.

Ride your civilization to its peak and then move on to the next one.  You must play with multiple different strategies during a single game as you control different civilizations.  Since the civilization properties are random, there's lots of replay value here.  Good player interaction and tense choices.

[2 plays] 3 and 6 player games. It plays quite differently with the min and maximum number of players, but is very good both ways.

I had high expectations and this game met them all. I suspect this may become a classic in my collection. Combine History of the World and Risk inside of a Eurogame blender and trust me that the results taste very good. If you want to find out a lot more about this game, do yourself a favor and listen to Mark Johnson's "BoardGames To Go" podcast on this game. He and David Arnott go into lengthy detail and give a very accurate picture of how the game plays and why it is a great game.

Most recent play 11-17-06 with Michael, Brian P, Corey, Alex, and Garrett.

RATING: 8
The rise and fall of civilizations.

Each player selects civilization tiles that determines the characteristics of their chosen civilization. These give you 'troops' that are used to take over other territories and some special effects.

Battle is abstract; you just need to invade with tokens that the terrain requires plus any opponent tokens. There are bonuses for some tiles.

Once players start to lose grip on their empires. They can declare it in decline and select a new pair of civilization tiles and start afresh. VPs are gained for territories that players control.

The combination of civ tiles makes the game. You never know what will turn up and what to expect. Strategies are made and changed depending on what tile you and other people have. Fun stuff.

Can drag a little with 5 or 6 players as there can be some downtime when players are taking their turns and paralysed by the plethora of choices. The kingmaking is bad if players play poorly. Play with people who know what they're doing and there's none of that.

This is really a neat game.  Lots of cool mechanics.  Everything is nice and simplified, fun special powers mean that the game will be different every time.  All this is great.  The only thing is that I just had a hard time becoming emotionally committed to anything that I did.  I just didn't feel any personality in the game.  There was no real love for my empires, so I just didn't care either way if they won or lost.  Everything was just back and forth, trying to get points rather than have anything really accomplished.

UPDATE: Well it has been years since I've played this last.  Finally, I decided to give it another go.  I've played many games since my last visit with Vinci, and while I still wish it weren't as abstract I can now appreciate just how beautiful the design is.  This game was so far ahead of its time, and really holds up well. 

The endgame is easily fixed with the game ending every round with a die roll after a player has reached 90 points. 100 points still ends the game.

I really enjoyed Vinci.  It's an abstracted war/civilization game that really functions and flows well.  I really enjoyed the mechanism of the civilization attribute tiles and how one would run with a civilization and and then take it into decline to start up a new civilization.

---

My reaction to the game has cooled somewhat after playing a game with four players.  Perhaps I'm not that interested in a "civization" game with such a bend toward running a periodic civilization, as I think I would rather have one civilization that I control for the entirety of a game.

This is very much a wargame/conquest game, but since there are no dice, the combat is pretty deterministic.  Plenty of interesting decisions abound in this one: when do I decline my current civilization, what civilization do I take next, which civilization do I attack?  This is a quality game, and probably will move up to a 9 the next time after the next time I play it.

An empire game with a civilization theme.

The board (europe, parts of asia) is seeded with 1 neutral army per region. Everyone starts with 10VP. 6 sets of 2 tiles describing civ attributes are placed on board, in places 1-->6. In turn, players pick one as their starting civ. The pair in spot 1 is free, then must pay 2VP per spot beyond that -- these VP are placed with the civs. Any vacated place is filled by sliding more distant civs left one space, then drawing a new civ pair for place#6.

To start the game, you'll enter the board with your new civ. May enter from any side of the board, including traveling through 1 sea space. Each civ gets # tokens based on civ tiles   # based on players in game. On later turns, you may first opt to decline --> remove previous civ from board, then remove all but 1 token from each region of your current civ, then choose a new civ (pair of tiles) as at start of game. 

If don't decline, may expand your civ. Pick up any of your tokens from board (may abandon regions if you want to do so). You must conquer every region you want to expand into, and may only expand from an adjacent region (with some civ tiles allowing you to attack across water). Expansion which costs a # of tokens from your hand: 2   # enemy tokens already there   1 if attacking into mountain or forest - 1 if attacking from mountain  /- bonuses from civ tiles (yours and defender's, if any). If attacking a neutral region, the token is removed from board. If attacking another player, they lose 1 token and take others into hand (and end of your turn, they place tokens in hand into the regions they still control). At the end of your turn, you must check for continuity: all controlled regions must be connected (some civ tiles modify this requirement); if not, must consolidate. Then, get VP: 1/non-mountain controlled region (including your older civ)   bonuses from civ tiles (if any; CURRENT civ only). Game ends at end of round when any player has reached target VP (varies with # players).

---
This is an interesting, moderate-weight game. The civ-theme works well, although I would certainly not call this a "civilization game"! The major issues are: trying to control your VP (with public VP, there's a LOT of leader-bashing), figuring out when to expand your civ and when to decline, and when it's worth it to spend VP to get a particular civ. The leader-bashing gets to be kind of annoying, though.

Update: still prefer this theme (and artwork) over Small World!

As a friend of mine said - its a lot of fun to play, but the end game has a bit of a kingmaker issue. I played a couple of games with the random surprise ending (after a certain score is reached, start rolling a die each turn to determine if the game ends) - but guess what? It just makes the winner random and doesn't add much. I do like this one - its best with 4 face-to-face and actually is great PBEM via vassal. The only real issue with this one is the downtime if you play face-to-face, but players that don't dwaddle help a lot.

There really is a feeling of empires rising and falling in this game.

Small World may have ironed out a few of the wrinkles from Vinci, but the original still has a few benefits over the remake.  I like the requirement of having a contiguous force, which gives opponents a different goal for some attacks and makes you think about the board differently.  Vinci's other great advantage over Small World is the importance of the terrain.  Differences in mountains and forests give greater importance to specific locations on the board and add another element to think about.  While Small World eliminated some of the logistical issues in Vinci, it also eliminated some of the depth.

So I got this played finally and I like it. I played Small World first and certainly feel it's the junior of the two games though there are some things I like about both of them better. Vinci really does drag a bit but that can be shortened by either lowering the victory point level or by just setting a number of turns like SW does. Very cool game no doubt but SW is good too. I own Vinci and really don't feel there is any reason to own both. Therefore SW is now off my wants list.

Game plays really well till the end when everyone teams up on the 1st and/or 2nd place player and someone sneaks up and wins.  Seems like a game where you don't want an early lead and want to just wait for the right "technologies" to come along.

I really like this game. My friends are more into it than me.

Actually, I was disappointed in having gotten the wrong versions of the game, and have finally found an English 2nd edition set and am looking forward to getting into this game.  Many in my game group hold it as the very best! I now have Small World which has already gotten a few plays.  It is similar to Vinci, but doesn't make Vinci obsolete by any means.

I have just played my first game of Vinci, a good game of growth, decline, rebirth.  There is very little luck, and I was afraid that would lead to a static, predicable game, but instead, it was very dynamic.

The different civilizations tiles can combine in interesting ways.  Some civilizations are more stable, and others only last a few turns.  This opens some opportunities and closes others, so tiles that are hard to use one turn might be very profitable the next.

Also, due to the ebb and flow, it is hard to get too attached to a civilization, so there were fewer gripes and complaints about being attacked.  I have heard comments that the game seems abstract, but while I felt somewhat detached from the plight of my current people, I felt a strong sense of theme from a more distant perspective.

RATING: 5.5
Vinci is a game I want to love, want to play all the time and rate an 8 or 9.  But it's got problems, big problems.  Mainly: open scoring makes for a poor endgame bogged down with kingmaking and excruciatingly slow rounds of hosing-the-leader.  And when we tried it with closed scoring, all we were left with is point optimization, and the end was far too sudden- the cure swung the pendulum to the other extreme, and both ways felt unsatisfying.

Which is a real pity.  Vinci has a multitude of great ideas- the one player as multiple civs, the special powers, and the Civilization-like combat system (ported to an engine where territorial conquest is more central) are all great ideas that ought to work well together.  But I'm not so sure anymore that there's a simple fix to get them out into a playable form.

Edit: As it so happens, Small World is exactly the fix I was looking for (and expecting never to see).

The historical theme is nice to differentiate it from [gameid=40692], but this is the same game.  The combinations of civilization traits make for an interesting what-if, but the weird abstraction of the map keeps anything from feeling earnestly historical.  Not to mention that the civilization traits seem connected to the theme in name only -- these are obviously mechanics that got named after the fact.  Civ-lite this ain't, but rather an interesting, but slightly too simple, skirmish game.

This was one of the first games that I played when I got into this pit of boardgame doom. My tastes have evolved since I started so this rating may not be valid.

Closest thing to a "Euro war game" that I've played.  Interesting "decline" of civilization option.  Moved at a pretty good pace.

[02.08]  PLayed 1 2nd game with 6, which was one or two players too many.  Very tight map.  Like the idea of hidden scoring (with poker chips or something) to prevent leader bashing and speed up game play a bit.

Some of the ideas here are fantastic: the different combinations of civilization tiles that come up are great and offer a continually different problem to analyze. The decline mechanism is elegant and interesting, and definitely induces tension as one tries to figure out when to put a civ on the chopping block. I'm afraid the whole isn't quite as great as the sum of some of the parts though- towards the end the downtime starts to grate, and the kingmaker issues are pretty brutal.

I played Small World before this, but I still found Vinci to be worthwhile. I can definitely see some of the improvements in SW (fewer clunky civilization interactions, more sensible map design), but there are also things I like better about Vinci (no berserker die, 6 player support), so it balances out. I chose Vinci because my game group is 6 people, but I think if I had 5 or fewer I would probably have purchased SW instead.

Relatively quick "empire building" game (~2 hrs).  Variable civilization trait combinations add to the replayability.  End game problem can be minimized with variable turn ending, or hidden scoring.  I a may actually enjoy this better than Small World.  Update 11/13/17: Given away to Mike D.

Played Vinci several times with Players new to boardgaming (merely 'risk' Players) and they loved this game. There is minimum 'luck' in this game. It scales well from 3 - 5 Players and takes about 2 hours to play. Some Players here on BGG have problems with the open score (bash the leader syndrome). I personally have no problem with this at all, we always play it open and until now the best Player won. 

It's a perfect introduction game, easy to learn and lots of tension. It's a great game for Gamers too, it has enough layers to keep you interested.

Recommended!

Weak grasp of theme, with the map managing to be both too bland and too garish at the same time. The lack of geographical or historical references sucks. Am I a Gaul?  A Saxon?  A Visigoth?  Reconciling the theme is difficult, and needn't have been.

Still, underneath those (superficial, but glaring) flaws, this is a fine game. Lots to think about, a couple of really fun choices each turn, and it has both strategic *and* tactical interest. I agree that if you're going to take it seriously, the endgame degeneracy must be addressed (easy to do, but all mediocre solutions).

Very cool game.  I especially like the constant cycling of new civilizations.  It keeps the game moving and is a great way of avoiding player elimination.  Sadly, it is true, the endgame is marred by kingmaking possibilities and bash the leader issues.

Excellent light wargame.  However, I think I won't play it with 6 again as it just drags on too long.  Also, I'm not convinced that the open scoring is "fun."  What I mean by that is that with open scoring, the game takes a lot longer than the same game would take with closed scoring (as people agonize over how to bash the leader best).  Does this add enough fun to justify the extra time the game takes?  I'm interested in trying Small World to see how that game handles this issue.

Takes a play or two to understand how to maximize your position and learn the special tiles. Knowing when to go into decline is not as hard as I initially thought. You just need to know what the next civilization will do for you.

RATING: 7.5
Played several times (with 3 to 5 players). A very solid "Civ-lite" game with lots of good ideas. The characterization of civilizations with 2 tiles is very well done, and decline and how to time it well is a key of the game. The main problem, in my experience, is the visible scoring which, along with the fact it is easy to target the leader, makes it usually safer not to get a starting lead.

Excellent game of rising and falling civilisations. Plenty of tricky decisions to be made in terms of which civilisation to choose, where to expand and when to go into decline. Lots of replayability due to the varied special powers provided by civilisation tiles. The only downside is the potential for over-analysis to slow the game down - best not to play with more than four unless they're all fast players.

At first I quite liked it. It has a certain elegance, at any rate. The problem is that it suffers from the worst bash-the-leader syndrome I have ever seen.

I had a good time learning this on my first play, but keeping track of the math was a tad much for some players and it definitely was too dry for my wife.  Maximizing power combos, maximizing your turn tactically and choosing the best time to decline all interacted nicely to make a very clean game.  Could get a little stale with repeated plays and everyone making "optimal" moves... Even more interested to see Small World now that I've played its predecessor...

Interesting mechanics, but a tad too slow and suffers from kingmaking and analysis paralysis at the end of the game. It also always takes a long time to explain, even though when you play it the mechanics seem very straightforward.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Reminds me a lot of History of the World and probably scratches the same itch.  I like the variety in the combination of powers as well as seeing them being utilized in unexpected ways.  Since each civilization's growth is capped initially by the amount of tokens allocated to it, its potential to score is also limited.  While the decision of whether to put your empire in decline and to start a new one is of utmost importance, most of the times it is fairly obvious (especially when you start to lose pieces on the board and/or expansion is no longer going to gain you more points).

Having only played Vinci once, I can't confirm whether there is a kingmaking problem, but I did noticed two issues: it seemed to be very hard to catch up once you started to fall behind, and unless you are lucky enough to grab a civilization with a powerful combo, there is absolutely no other mechanism inherent to the game to allow you to narrow the gap.  The other is of course the bash-the-leader syndrome.  I personally don't think this is a negotiation game and table dealing of which regions to occupy or give up between players really does not belong here.

High replayability and the simplicity in design are definitely two best things in Vinci that will keep me coming back for more.

The two best parts of this game are knowing when to decline an empire and the mechanics of choosing your next one.

Look for the Version 2 rules with corrections and clarifications.

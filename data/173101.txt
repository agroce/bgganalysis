Route planning game that is easy to learn, scales well, has some simple but interesting choices, and has a bit of an addictive "want to play again" feel to it.

The game is about building in cities that are spread over three regions.  A turn is very simple, first you draw a card (they come in 7 different colors and represent influence with the regional council), then you can do one action and potentially several bonus actions. You choose from: 1) changing the council and gaining 4 gold (money is one of several resources and its tight and gets capped on a track at 20 gold, similar to pillars of the earth), 2) obtain a building permit (this requires playing matching cards to the council and/or gold), and you get a nice one-time bonus the moment you obtain it, 3) build a building using your matching building permit (this is where you are pulled in different directions, you obtain a bonus immediately in the city you build in and you trigger a reoccurrence of all bonuses in cities that you are already connected to, however, you may want to jump around to unconnected cities in order to race to complete certain bonuses, as you score a bonus point tile for being first and only first to finish a region or to finish a type of building, PLUS you also obtain a bonus point token from the king if you complete your bonuses early enough), 4) build a building using the Kings influence, which works similar to action 3 except you don't need a building permit however you have to pay extra gold to move the king around the board.

The bonus actions generally all require the use of assistants, which are like another currency, and these actions are: 1) buy more assistants for gold, 2) bump a councilor from a region by paying 1 assistant, 3) flush a set of building permits by paying 1 assistant, 4) take an extra turn by paying 3 assistants.

The game goes into end phase when someone builds their last (tenth) building and small extra points are paid out for first to finish the game, most building permits, and furthest advancement on the prestige track. The prestige track is a separate scoring path to take as the further you advance on it, the better the one-time bonus payouts you get and you advance in this track through city bonuses and permit bonuses. There are many ways to score points in game and end game, and the game is simple and quick and allows for somewhat different strategies. The board is semi modular, and the components are serviceable although there are some minor issues with the drabness of the board, and how the council pieces fit in the board. Seems to be an overlooked title but I've learned to always watch for games by this design team, they know how to make good games.

Bel gioco.
Ricorda un po' thurn und taxis ma qui si sviluppa una simpatica meccanica di combo che fa entrare punti,soldi ed altre cose a catena.
L'unico difetto secondo me è che se dai primi turni non si sceglie bene la strada da percorrere diventa difficile recuperare in corso di gioco.Occhio alla mappa e scegliete bene il giro da fare dunque!

RATING: 6
Council of Four bears a superficial resemblance to Voyages of Marco Polo.  Once again Luciani and Tascini have us building networks of merchant houses, with each town offering a different bonus.  In place of Marco Polo's secret objectives is a visible set that all players can aim for.  For Marco Polo's dice and gold and camels, Council of Four substitutes cards and gold and assistants.   

For all these resemblances, Council of Four is a much simpler, more streamlined game.  Its central dilemma is how to strike a balance between building an engine and grabbing victory points.  That's also its problem; I've been asked that same question so many times before.  Got another question, Council of Four?  No?   For me that staleness is compounded by the game's solitaire-ish nature.  The only interaction is of a got that before you nature.  

Production quality is decent, although the die cutting of the assistants could have been better.  The artwork is poor. The muted colours of the towns make distinguishing one set from another  challenging - even in good light. At least the iconography is easily understood.  The English rules are fine.

RATING: 6
A decent medium weight euro with a spatial, "build your engine by stringing along houses on a board" mechanic.  A bit too much down time for my tastes in our four player game, and the game seems to produce curious "engine jealousy" wherein those ahead in the game REALLY snowball ahead, while the laggards have small, modest unsatisfying turns.  

The game also curiously produced very swingy feelings (elation or dejection, a lot of dejection actually) about the card draws that begin each turn.  In the middle to end portions of the game, other things being essentially equal, whether one drew the correct colored card seemed to be VERY decisive in determining whether you won the game, which is not a great feature for a 2 hour medium weight euro.  Really, winning is going to come down to drawing an orange card?   Darn, another pink card!

I am told that Council of Four plays much better with three, with everyone having fun running across the board and consistently reaping great benefits that also speed the game forward, which sounds plausible.  So willing to try the game again with three...though barely.

Council of Four uses politics cards to build buildings in cities across the land.  The councils determine building cost, but can be manipulated to you liking. Gain VPs with building bonuses which will build fast by a unique chaining event. There is also a King who helps you build and grants additional rewards.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
There are some really interesting things to this game, however some of it feels VERY unpolished.  The purple scoring deck seems to really decide the game, which is disappointing since there might really only be one strategy to win.  Giving this a "6" for now because I am not sure after just 1 play, but this worries me.  If this game had been polished a bit more, I really think there could of been something very cool here.

Med-euro.  Pretty interactive.  Sweet mix of area control with chaining bonuses.  And who doesn't get off on chaining bonuses.  Excellent council control game mechanic.  You ARE building a political machine.  Sleeper hit from the Orleans, Marco Polo, Austrian Hotel gang.  This is the shit!

It starts off strong but peters out at the end.  Later turns can turn into an AP nightmare.  The councils and how they are influenced by changing their makeup is neat but it's not enough to make for a great game.  After it's all said and done, I don't feel the need to play it again or own it.

Shades of Marco Polo's route planning.

Front heavy.

Streamlined, intuitive rules. Only 10 minutes to explain. 

Limited replayability. Stringing your bonuses on assistants and extra cards is too dominant as that one and only strategy has won every single game.

+ When you push a meeple out of council they fall

- The board has poor ergonomy: the colors of cities, the same arrow used in different ways, player aid without some info
- Too many random factors: cards + tiles + meeples
- In late game give the cities rewards is pace-breaking (if you have a lot of cities connected)

Ticket to Ride killer. This is a short, light game in the vein of TTR or Thurn & Taxis that is really easy to teach while providing a lot of tense decisions and satisfying combos. The game is complex enough, however, that gamers have room for improvement over multiple plays. I love the tension between the race to build in cities first for area bonuses versus the temptation to always build in a line to combo your cities. Very fast, very fun. 

Too bad CMON had to ruin the lovely first edition with that grotesque cartoony art and unnecessary chrome.

Game designed by the duo from Tzolk'in. I enjoyed everything about this game but the racing element immediately spoils the fun for me. The first player to complete the tile scoring scores an additional bonus VP, and this bonus VP decreases in value for the subsequent scoring of bonuses (25 VP, 18, 12, 7, 3)

In my first game (4p), three of my opponents got the additional bonus VP, while I didn't. Because of how huge the bonus VPs are, I felt demotivated to even trying to get one, cuz I can't even catch up eventhough I score the next bonus VP. 

So I basically concluded that, if you don't score this bonuses, don't even bother thinking that you will win the game.

In my second game (3p), I played with two players who are still new to the game. I managed to get the first two bonuses. The points were so huge that it's even impossible for them to match my VP. I won by a landslide. 

So this post a huge dilemma to me. I really enjoy what this game has to offer but because of the racing and the swingy bonuses, this will somewhat remain less fun to play.

Desperately dull and under cooked point scoring race. The jockeying of meeples in each section was amusing as the meeples are pushed of the reviewing stands, but that cannot make up for the randomness of the card draws and the crazy values associated by getting somewhere first, or having the "most of" something.

Ticket to ride jellegű, színes kártyagyűjtős majd abból hálózatot építős játék. Jó ötlet, hogy a akciók aktiválásához szükséges színeket lehet változtatni, bár félek, hogy ez fájdalmasan kidobott akciónak számít a játék. Jópofa a láncreakciós aktiválás is, de ennek az adminisztrálása kicsit nehézkes. Sokkal-sokkal jobban tetszett, mint a ticket to ride, mert lényleges több döntés adatik meg a játékban, de még így is volt néha kicsit olyan tevékenység érzésem menet közben. Kettesben barátnővel jó időtöltés, de kifejezetten társasos eseményeken nem venném elő.

Négy játék után még jobb véleménnyel vagyok róla. Jó kis taktikai játék, kicsit olyan kingdom builder érzéssel a mélységet és varianciát tekintve. Azért vannak helyzetek, amikor kicsit sajnos be lehet szorulni, de figyelni kell rá, hogy ne nagyon fordulhasson elő. Továbbra is csak kettesben próbáltam, de most már kíváncsi vagyok egy többfős játékra is.

Marco Polo's little brother. Some of the elements are unmistakable but the game certainly stands on its own and sets a distinctly different focus. Where Marco Polo is an intricate puzzle Council of Four is an all-out race that not only forgives but demands a couple of inaccuracies for the sake of not losing speed. Just like its big brother, however, the game is highly volatile and can (and will) easily go into tilt. This effect is even more pronounced here because of an enormous snowball effect when building your houses.

It seems to me that those who complain about the snowball being too decisive are missing the point of the game, and I still expect run-away leaders even when all players are familiar with the game (although the may become a little smaller). Not unlike The City, once a player gets his engine rolling the game is already over. No but, no catching up. Charmingly old-school with fairly simple rules but possibly a little too harsh to merit a recommendation for family play. Might rise with further plays.

COUNCIL OF FOUR ist der kleine Neffe von Onkel MARCO POLO. Die gleiche Handschrift ist unverkennbar. Nicht genial wie MARCO POLO oder exzellent wie TZOLKIEN, aber immer noch stärker als viele andere Genrebrüder. Und dies obwohl man auch im Konzil alles bereits aus anderen Spielen kennt: variabler Startaufbau, Handkarten sammeln, Farben bedienen, Handelshäuser setzen, Netzwerk bilden, Kombiausschüttungen etc pp. Dabei wirkt einiges aus MARCO POLO im Euro-Concilio charmant zweitverwertet, nur eine Nummer kleiner eben und grobstofflicher gestaltet. Aber der namensgebende Konzil auf dem Balkon ist eine neue, hübsche Idee. Regelwerk erfrischend schlank. Gelungenes, kurzweiliges Eurogame alter Schule, das sich in einer satten Stunde super spielen lässt. Das Gefallen des Flundi für das Konzil der Vier.

A few great mechanisms in this game: 
- Get the bonus of a city when you bild in it and get the bonus of all connected cities where you have already built. 
- Pay with cards to do actions. The cards you need can be changed by pushing out one of the meeples who tell you what cards need to be played. 

What was not so great: 
- Most turns you cannot do anything good, feels like you almost have not done a turn. Other turns you may do 2 actions.
- A race for completing things the first to complete get a almost game winning points. The second get nothing. Nothing. I repeat nothing. That is horrible. There are a few thing to race for but you might be behind and without chance to complete something first. 
- It is more expensive to build where someone else has build an if you fall behind someone you are behind for the whole game and need to pay more every turn.

INITAL IMPRESSION 

I enjoyed the chaining towns aspect of this game, that was cool. There is also a set collection aspect with the colors of towns and a time urgency to complete sets for extra points. I was ok with the scoring pace for this for the most part except the purple tiles depreciated faster than I'd like.

This game had promise but there is a lot of polish issues. The component and color setup is horrible. The purple tiles should have been lower points and also depreciate slower. The point towns seem to suck and also the council track is hard to move down, I think there was missed opportunity there. Will have to see if that was just a factor of the first game setup or not. Finally the cards and council members on the trains seemed boring. There could have been more done with that but it works I guess

I want to try this 1-2 more times to be sure

Very good first impression. Somehow reminds me of Russian Railroads in the sense that this is also a game which starts slowly but gains enormous momentum as it progresses. This is the type of game which rewards careful long-term planning along with grabbing short-term oppurtunities. More yet, it is [b]not[/b] one of these Euros which are hopelessly overloaded with tons of different mechanisms. Instead we have slimlined rules along with a pretty clear board layout.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: euro de construcció de "puestos comerciales". Es tracta de construir casetes en ciutats unides per carreteres. Per construir necessites losetes, que a la vegada s'obtenen fent set collection de un tipus de cartes determinades (cada torn robes una).

Molt abstracte i extremadament sencill, la part del mapa pot tenir certa similitud amb el Marco Polo però li falta tota la profunditat estratègica d'aquest. No crec que valgui la pena ni probarlo, d'aquests autors aquest Essen em quedo amb el Grand Austria Hotel.

It's like Ticket to Ride and Deus had a baby. You have the colored cards that you draw somewhat similar to TTR and you get the compound bonuses like Deus. The playing area of the game board is split into 3 pieces with reversible and interchangeable backs to create a dynamic playing board. I really like the way that you can manipulate the council by bumping one off the end or mitigate the colors with the use of money/coins if you do not have all the needed color cards. In addition, there are multiple paths to victory. You can try going for the large bonus tiles for completing certain sets, go for the compounding bonuses of the board and/or nobility track, or a combination. I have seen all scenarios work for a winner. I also like that you can have a simple turn or spend extra resources to have a longer compounded bonus move or moves during your turn. The compounding bonuses of the board is probably my favorite once you get your engine going from previous placement of emporiums. This really is a great game. I could easily see some expansion game boards for this in the future too.

A family-game with some deepness, w/o luck and with only little bit of conflict (in good or bad). A big point awards to quickest builders gives to the game unfavorable randomness, though. My feeling is that if it gets more plays, will be upraded to 7.

RATING: 8.5
Really fun light eurogame. The combo potential of building a big connected path across the board has to be balanced with aiming for some of the points you get for building in certain disconnected places, as these points can be huge. And the way the building permits come with immediate bonuses as well as rights to build in certain cities makes for really interesting decisions where you want certain bonuses and certain cities, and figuring out which combination is best for you at any given time. There is definitely some card luck and if anything the bonus points for building in certain places seems almost too high, but for a lighter game it works well.

[floatleft][ImageID=2648492][/floatleft]Council of Four is a light-medium game with very few defining features. On your turn you draw a card, then perform one main action and one quick action. The crux of the game is to be the first to build houses in certain sets of locations, for example all mountain cities, or all blue cities. Each set has a bonus tile which rewards more or less VP based on the difficulty of completing the set. However, there are king's bonuses which are awarded to the first players to complete ANY set. So the first set completed nets you its bonus and the first king's bonus. The second set completed rewards its bonus and the second king's bonus. The king's bonuses represent huge amounts of points leading players to race towards the low hanging fruit in the early game.

In order to build in a city you must appease the council of four to get permission. There are several councils of four meeples for different sections of the board, the only important feature is the colour of the meeples. To get permission to build you must play 1 to 4 cards from your hand to match the colours of the meeples. If you match all four you get permission at no additional cost, if you match less than four you must pay some coins. There are actions that allow you to slowly change the colour of the meeples present, but largely you are at the mercy of the draw deck. If you draw cards that nicely match the councils you would like permission from it's a huge advantage. If you are unlucky you have to take inefficient actions. This combined with the importance of racing for the king's rewards left me utterly indifferent towards this game. It is far too luck dependent to take seriously.

[center][ImageID=2657750 medium][/center]

I will mention something that I liked about the game. When you build in a city you get a small bonus, each city has a different bonus assigned at the start of the game. You also get the bonuses of all cities you have built in that are connected to this city via a chain of cities you occupy. This encourages you to build adjacent to cities you already occupy, but many goals encourage the opposite creating a nice tension in which strategy to pursue. Managing your builds with an eye on the set collection but also on maximizing your bonus activation is interesting. At least it would be if you had more control over where you can build.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Don't let the appearance and the simple ruleset fool you into believing that this is an alternative to Thurn & Taxis. Council of Four's only similarities are choosing one out of four actions each turn and a map with connected cities.

The four actions are acquiring a build permit, changing the composition of a council, establishing a trading house with a build permit, and building a trading house directly by appealing to the King's Court. Beside that, players can execute one additional minor action. What makes Council of Four interesting, are the one-time effects of the build permits when acquired and especially the immediate city effects when building a trading house. As the effects of all neighbouring cities are executed where a player has established a house before, the game quickly evolves (or devolves) into a snowball rolling downhill at great speed. There's a similarity to the authors' Marco Polo in this, as it pays out to scrutinize the board at the start to find the best links and form an initial strategy.

The snowball effect is the one thing which worries me a bit. With more experience, there shouldn't be a runaway leader problem but in my first game I had elevenfold the points of the last player due to exploiting two neighbouring 'advance on nobility track' effects repeatedly.

RATING: 6
A solid game that fails to excite. I like how quickly it moves - the amount of rules is just right. But with the huge number of medium-light games about European nobility, it is very hard for this one to distinguish itself. I'm not a big fan of the components, which while original, were hard to handle in the one play I had.

I am torn about this game.  The mechanics are fun, and I am compelled to play it.  But I think the whole game boils down to the first to get the 2 blue city bonus.  In my last game, I battled another player for the blue city bonus.  He managed to get the bonus in his 2nd turn.  This gave him 30 points.  He won the game with 51 points.  The last place player had something like 27 points.

Getting the first King's bonus probably doesn't guarantee a win, but it is pretty strong.

I understand the designer playtested the game and kept increasing the King's bonus to where it is now.  But I just don't see how the chains can compete against the blue city bonus.

RATING: 5
A combination between Ticket to Ride and Thurn und Taxis?

If there's a runaway leader that have already the combo engine going, it can hardly be stopped. 
Since placing emporiums costs more the more emporiums are placed in that city this can lead to a chain reaction of the leader comboing all his emporiums, drawing cards, money and workers, while others lags behind because emporiums are already placed and they need to pay more to put them down.

By the designers of the Voyages of Marco Polo and Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar. Clever take on set collection and route building, it plays pretty quickly and has a good amount of tension because of the race for the bonus points for building in certain regions or cities. Each time you build in a city if you add to your route you get to trigger every other bonus on that route, so has a nice sense of progression throughout the game. About 90 minutes with 3-4 players.

Very good game.  I enjoyed gathering the politics cards in order to build emporiums in the cities and, once built, the soring of the rewards.  I particularly liked how the rewards paid out again for all chained cities.  The game works well with four (haven't played at any other player count).

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I want a different scoring mechanism with this otherwise interesting game. Did not care for the highly weighted scoring  king tiles for completing goals early. Did feel the mechanism of chaining your link of city actions together to be a really interesting aspect of the game but I'm not sure it works well with the chosen scoring method. Artwork leaves a bit to be desired as well. The council of four aspect was interesting, but I'm not certain if it was that meaningful or mostly fluff with the king's council largely being able to get around the details as long as you had money. In short, I wish this one had seen a bit more development because there are promising elements let down by scoring and graphic design.

RATING: 7
A medium-light game that is all about chasing boni. Players erect their little houses in cities connected by a road network. Each city provides a bonus, e.g. VP, money, or assistens, according to a tile randomly placed during setup. However, all your cities that are connected by roads also payout their bonus. To place your houses in cities you need to have a build permit. Getting these is the most fun aspect of the game!

For each of three regions there is a 3D cardboard balcony with four meeples, the council. To get a permit of which two are available at any time you have to bribe the council. You do this with cards from your hand the color of which needs to match the color of the council members. Assume the council has one orange, two blue, and one purple member. If I have all four matching cards (orange, blue, blue, purple, or a wild card) the permit is for free, the fewer matching cards I play the more expensive the permit is. However, the council is not fixed, as you can send your assistent to push out the most senior member and replace them with a new one.

Permits give boni, completing a set of cities, e.g. all blue cities, all cities in a region, gives boni, building houses gives boni. There is even a track that gives additional boni. 

This game plays in around one hour with minimal downtime and is quite fun. Calculating city boni during endgame is a little fiddly, "I get 2 plus 1 VP, this city gives 2 coins, one, two, four assistents, a card, oh did I count this VP already?..."

Review after 1 play 7, I can see this one going up.

(10/17) 8. Fantastic game of area control and a touch of set collection.  The council mechanism where you can influence which cards will activate a region of the board is really cool.  You can manipulate it so that playing in a section is cheaper, but if you really need to go somewhere and don't have the right hand you can always pay to play.  Really great game.

Not a bad game at all, I liked it better than I expected. Building chains of houses, score bonuses to build your next houses quicker and more efficient. But sometimes forget to do a chainscore and go for the big bonuses for being the first to build in all cities of a certain colour. In the beginning you can have a slow start to collect your stuff: money, assistants and most importantly, cards. Once you have your chain of houses going, life becomes easier all of a sudden. I would not mind to play this game again.

Really enjoyable game of gathering politics cards, money and manipulating the seats of four different councils to get permits to build emporiums in a network of towns. It's a game where each choice feels like it could be a good one.

Do you go for building permits to gain their additional rewards or influence the King for more rapid building? Do you quickly go for city colours so you can snatch up the very tempting King's favour bonuses? Or do you take the slower route and build up chain-bonuses from connected towns? In this game, anything could happen.

The rules are fairly simple to understand and the game plays fairly quick (roughly an hour or so, depending on the amount of players). It works nicely with two and three, and I have a feeling it will work nicely with four as well, but will neither confirm or deny it once I have tried it with four.

One of the best games of 2015. A route-building game that challenges players to balance their interests between one-off scoring bonuses and smaller bonuses that chain successively.

The cover and the map use dim and dirty colors that convey a feeling of sadness (to me). Otherwise, the components are nice. The board is cut and can be positioned in 8 different ways to ensure variability. The rules are pretty well written and easy to understand.

It's an abstract-ish medium euro that combines diverse mechanisms in order to create emporiums in the cities. Whenever you set up and emporium, you receive the city bonus AND (and here comes the original part and the key of the game) [b]the bonus of all the connected cities where you already have emporiums[/b]. Logically, you'll only want to build in linked cities, but there's also pretty neat rewards that will tempt you to do otherwise.

One of the best features of this game is its fluidity. Once you learn the ropes, the turns come and go pretty fast. 1 hour is an excellent duration for a game such as this one.

My main [possible] issue is the snowball effect. You obtain bonuses from connected cities, each time the bonuses are larger and you can do more and more in your turns, to the point of being able to buy one emporium per turn. Given these circumstances, it's almost impossible to catch-up. And it also works in the other way: if you perform bad, you can find yourself out of the game already in the first turns.

I might increase my rating if my next gameplays who I'm wrong.

Council of Four is a connection game in which you place your markers in cities to activate not only the ability of that city, but also the ability of any cities you've previously claimed that are connected to it.  This sort of "chain reaction" is really what drives the game.  Additionally, there are large bonuses to be claimed for collecting sets of cities, which are generally spread out all over the map and not easy to connect.  The board is somewhat modular, and the city bonuses are random, so each game may feature different synergies.  I found the game to be much shorter than I expected in my first play, but that might be because one player took a ton of extra turns and claimed twice as many cities as the next player.  Overall, the gameplay was fun and different, but it never struck me as great.

RATING: 7
Engine building Euro with variable setup. Players manipulate and influence the four councils in order to build emporiums in the fifteen cities of the board. Building an emporium gives the player the benefit of the city and all connected cities where the players has an emporium. This creates the engine, providing money, points, cards and other things.

At odds with the engine building are the bonuses for completing sets of cities, that also provides additional bonuses for the five first completed goals. These sets are one set of five for each part of the map and four sets for each city color providing more points for the larger, harder to complete sets.

Since the game map is made up of three double sided parts that combine to for different road networks and the city bonuses are randomly distributed for each game, there's a great variation in setup. This forces different approaches for each game. There is also the consideration of the other players since every emporium already built in a city increases the cost of building another one.

At this point it seems that the start player often wins by a considerable margin in two player games.

RATING: 8
In this game, players are trying to gather points by putting their houses in every spot on the board that matches a region or a color of house. This is done through buying permit tiles, which require discarding sets of cards, whose colors match all the meeples sitting on the council area of that board section. If there are fewer different colors, you get to discard fewer cards, however you have to pay more dollars. The cards are a very limited resource, as you only get one new card each turn, and you might not wind up drawing what you need. The magic of the game is how you can take an action or a free action to pick up an unused meeple, and put him into the leftmost council seat in a region, bumping out the rightmost. In this way you can make the board line up better with your cards, barring the dickery of your opponents.

The other really cool thing about the game is when you put down a house in a city, you activate the city ability which gets randomized at the start of the game, and then you also activate the abilities of each other city in your connected chain of cities. This makes for some very compelling engine building. I'm very excited about this game right now. I hope for more plays soon.

An okay euro, though it feels a bit by-the-numbers and uninspired. There are some interesting decisions and you do have to pay attention to what other players are doing. I like that there are very different overall strategies that people can use to win (go for chain reactions on routes, go for quick bonus tiles, etc.). I don't really like the card drawing as a randomizer, though. It feels unsatisfying to not draw any cards you can use for several turns in a row. Overall, it's fine, but just doesn't have anything that makes it special in a market full of similar euros. In particular, I like Voyages of Marco Polo better than this one, and it shares a designer and several key components like route building.

Reminds me of Ticket to Ride and Thurn & Taxis. Much better than TTR. A bit more chaotic than T&T. There's a fair amount of luck in which cards come out, since they widely vary in power. Also, it's not a direct confrontation game, but a player could easily accidentally mess up your plans by bumping council members. Still, the building/combo mechanic leaves plenty of room for strategy and the variable setup means no two games will play exactly the same. This alone makes the game a worthy title. As an added benefit, the game zips along at a nice pace.

Very slick game with a lot going on. You really have to manage your money, cards, and assistants carefully. Chaining the cities you are in is very important, but you ABSOLUTELY cannot lose sight of the goal bonuses for any shot to win. The chaining bonuses can be a task to keep track of and it is probably common to miss something. Good replayability with the two sides of the board and randomized bonuses in the cities.

I felt I was also at a disadvantage at the start as I was dealt four cards of the same colour. Maybe playing with more than two would improve matters. If not, rating could go down with further plays.

I enjoyed a lot about my only play- I like how there are multiple ways to score points and how the initial board layout will change every game - thereby seriously changing every game.  In the game I played, the royalty track icons were next to each other, so combo'ing those bumps was easy and a smart move.  I chose to try to focus on high end bonus tokens early and try combo'ing points later - next game could be totally different.  I like that in a game.

RATING: 6
A solid game that presents its optimization puzzle as a snowball effect crossed with a positional game on the board. You ideally want to chain together adjacent bonuses on the board so that each time you add to the chain, you reap the benefits of each link over and over. If you build with gaps in your chain, you run the risk of falling behind. That said, building a continuous chain isn't always convenient or possible. There is also a little bit of hand management thrown into the mix along with some scoring bonuses that encourages you to pursue other strategies -- at least to a degree. Overall, the game feels solid, but also very much like a remix. My fatigue for remixes in the point-optimization genre is growing.

Players tend to randomly and unintentionally get screwed by other players.

Played the Prototype @Stahleck 2015: Was announced as the new Ticket to Ride or something like that. It's from the author of Tzolkien and Marco Polo, so you expect a heavy game.
It's rather like but in the actual version it's not the same level as TTR but more complex. Not a complex game but there is just way more in it.

Promising, but it needs much work to do right now!

draw colored card per turn (ticket to ride). fast
use cards to gain tile (set collection). tile has bonus on gain
later turn, the same tiles can be use to build in a region and get region bonus (so 2 phase building)
the key being is when yo build you also get the bonus for any connected cities in a route
building in region where person is, is more expensive ala Concordia
some bonuses like Thurs and Taxis

Ahhh . . . . route building, territory/city claiming, special abilities - a Euro with cute wooden bits.   Another efficiency type game where rewards are triggered for connections on the map.   Worth trying for sure.

Hidden point salad game with a fun mechanic watching meeples get displaced from their pulpits.

RATING: 7.8
Simple enough clean interesting game with high replayability and not much downtime, with several paths to victory.
Negative aspects: art isn't very good (but who cares?) and colors are dreadful! have you tried to see how many people can tell the difference between the hues "blue sky over Los Angeles" and "blue sky over Hollywood"? two group of cities have too similar colors. And the "J" looks incredibly like an "I" with that font. I am not the only one, 3 out of 4 got confused during our first game.

Anyways, very good game and rating could raise.

Strategy area control, network builder to expand your real estate holdings in the regions by influencing the king and the four 4-member councils.  The distinctive game element is matching colors of your political influence cards with the colored council meeples and changing the council make-up by placing new members to oust the oldest.  Place houses in a network of cities along the modular routes to trigger multiple city bonuses.  Resource balancing act between money, cards, and tiles by spending actions and bonus actions. It's a race to be first to claim specific area control objective tokens while advancing along the loyalty track to earn extra bonuses.

played at GOF 2016. Great idea. Production not so good. Artwork equally not good. Mechanistically, this game has a problem: runaway effect for the leader. Didn't finish the game.

Much prefer this as a 2-player. Difficult to plan for anything with 4 cuz the board changes so much and it’s hard to predict which permits and which council members will be available by your next turn. Feels too luck driven with more players.

I like the basics of this game , it just runs to long, maybe further plays will shorten it.

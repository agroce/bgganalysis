This rating is based on the entirety of the large playmat system of Hoplomachus, which includes TLC, the chip add-ons, the FaMel playmat and Rise of Rome. The below is copied from my rating of Hoplomachus: The Lost Cities.

"This is tough one to rate. Out of the box, TLC is about a 6. The mechanisms themselves are great, and there was thought put into all play modes (solo, coop, pvp). The base game of TLC, however, gets stale fast. As a comparison, the base game of Memoir '44 has more variability for half the price (just no solo mode). Once you get the add-on chips for TLC, the system starts to shine. Add in the FaMel playmat and Rise of Rome, and you have a great game with lots of replayability. So, I will split the baby a bit on rating Hoplomachus. I will give the base game of TLC a 6 for the deficiencies of the base game, but Rise of Rome somewhere around an 8, as more of an overall rating of the system itself. If you plan on only getting one of the Hoplomachus games, you might be disappointed if you choose TLC or Rise of Rome (maybe try Origins instead). If you plan on spending the money to get the entire series, you will have a great, light, solo-able, tactical skirmish game."

***Edit, June 2017: After playing Origins and seeing the excellent, self-contained package that it provides, I'm moving the "overall" rating of TLC & RoR (the large box series) to an 7, as a way to account for the differences in the costs required for TLC & RoR versus Origins. Origins is the box one should get if looking to minimize costs and/or if looking for the best entry point into Hoplomachus. The entirety of the Hoplo series is about an 8-9 for me.

I'll go ahead and rate this based on the excellent addition of two factions to the base game, but I need to play the solo game more to give it a more solid rating. The solo mode in this set is definitely promising and quite different from the solo mode of The Lost Cities.

Although this is a standalone game, I consider this more an expansion due to 2 factions feeling limited. The Lost Cities is a better entry point, and both sets together are definitely more than the sum of their parts.

Add the expansion chips as well.

Real cool game that brings something different (mechanically & thematically) to the table. Easy to get into even after few months, overproduced in a nice way. Plays quite quickly & easily, just the right balance btw decision making & casual & unshamed pleasure of rolling a bunch of dice.

Looks like "Lost Cities" but plays a little different. It's like having two different games with the same theme and you can play both with any of the cities.

I also own, Beast & Master, Legends of the Sand, Army of One, Blades edge.

After 3 plays I donâ€™t feel as if I have done more than scratch the surface of this game. It certainly is true that other sets and expansions add a myriad of abilities and I feel like the combo chances on this alone mean I could play this 50 times and still be finding new things.

The score is for the whole series and not the individual game.

It is the perfect solo game for my tastes. Fast setup time and play time. Luck and tactics will make this a unique experience everytime. The components are awesome so i love to get in on the table.Ordered and on its way

Rated primarily as a solitaire experience, which is quite fun and has lots of tactical meat on its bones relative to the play time (approx 45 minutes).

As a 2-player game, I'd probably rate it a 7, although this might go up if my kids take to it.

After painstaking research, this appears to be the Hoplo version for me.  The question is, how do I get it?  The designers/producers did tell me that they are locking down a Canadian distributor and they should be in place by the end of 2016.

Ordered it because of the supposedly solid solo battles. There aren't that many tactical skirmish games with hex maps out there that come with solo variants. Got the add-on with additional solo content, too, for this one, to have more titans to fight. More complex and more fulfilling than the Origins version. Plays a little longer, but the battles feel more complete, less puzzly - allthough behind it all there still is a mix of puzzke and probabilities. For me the perfect mix for solo play.

I love playing against the Titans.   Great solo game.  Just the right amount of randomness and luck.   A different challenge every time I play it.  It makes "The Lost Cities" even better.
The rules are easy to understand and remember.

Not for trade

This is not going to stay an "8" for long. I have been playing this so much in the last few days. This is creeping up into the "9" range very steadily. With so many ways of playing, and so many different combinations of gladiators to use, this game is replayable to the, heh, nines. Great support from the designers/publishers and a really clean rules set that belies a complex game underneath. AND I CANNOT GET OVER HOW MUCH I LOVE PLAYING WITH THE POKER CHIP PIECES. Yeah, CAPSworthy. Mos Def.

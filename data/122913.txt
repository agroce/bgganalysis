Finally got to play my first game yesterday using the C&C rules. This is an interesting mix of BattleLore and C&C:Ancients with twists inspired by the Sengoku period of Japanese history.

Keep a healthy reserve of honor to handle retreat results, remembering that attached leaders and Samurai Naginata themselves pay a heavy price for retreats. That's very important. Probably more than inspiring troops or playing Dragon cards. Your ranged combat troops (Ashigaru bowmen and arquebusiers) will play an important role in whittling down your opponent before sending the main force forward.

I plan to play the Art of Tactics rules with a friend this weekend.

My only complaint is the fragility of the beautiful figures. The game provides no clue about how to best store them between games and it takes almost no effort to snap an Ashigaru or Samurai polearm. This is not a casual game to set up or take down. 

Also, still in the process of getting this game painted. That is not a barrier to play as painting the figures is unnecessary—but it does add immensely to the visual appeal of the game.

Update: Also played a game on the Art of Tactic side. While quite playable with two people, I think it suits 4-6 players very well. This allows players to divide a force among themselves so that each player manages just a few units. This allows planning and execution to move quicker.

The idea of simultaneous actions in a Comands & Colors style game is fantastic. However, the implementation of this is incredibly clunky. Another turn-off were the many non-combat dice-rolls slowing down the game.

Spent hours putting figures together with several broke during the process. Figures are highly detailed. However, they are very delicate and will not transport easily. Cards are poor quality card stock and not graphic like other C & C games. Board and terrain hexes are thick. 3D mountain look is nice. However, terrain came in two shades of color. Not enough scenarios. I have C & C games and enjoy them. I am very disappointed in this product.

I have a few plays in each system down now, see my review for more details.

In summary the components over all are subpar and require a lot of effort to assemble and take care of. But this is a good game when you get a good scenario. Both systems depend on good scenarios and there are some shockers in the scenario books. When this game fires though, it is really mint.

C&C Samurai Battles brings yet another twist to the C&C series. The best of the lore from BattleLore (card play minus the fiddly council) and thematic retreat rules make this shine on it's own. A few things that may hold this back are (ironically) the detailed minis/models, limited amount of scenarios and Zvezda's recent cancellation of future unit releases. Because of the Dragon cards, not a good choice for solo play.

My rating is for the C&C game play only--not the AoT game, nor the components.

An excellent game and an excellent addition to the C&C family - I've not played the Art of Tactics rules as yet. I love the theme and, mechanics-wise, the 'honour and fortune' and the dragon cards are great. They add another level to troop management and some nice variety.

However, the overall package is let down slightly by the components. Initially, I loved the idea of minatures but they are fiddly and fragile and set up time is increased significantly because of them. The board is not jointed and comes in six prieces - to allow for variable set ups in the AoT game - but it's another hinderance when playing C&C.

Overall, I really like this game but would mostly choose to play C&C:Ancients over this. It's generally quicker and a lot more polished as a package.

UPDATE: I've converted the minatures to blocks so now the only negative that I have for this game is the wonky board. Otherwise it is a great addition to the Commands & Colors series. I can see this rating climbing if I can get to play it more often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fiddly gameplay and systems, even if they are thematic for most part. I find I don't have the patience anymore to flip through the rulebook making sure I'm not omitting minuscule rules.

The miniatures are unwieldy because of the long thin spears and the flag insert in the base. Blocks would actually be preferable. The spears also tend to break easily. Did I mention spending 10 hours putting the damn things together?

The card quality is ridiculously bad, literally on par with printing on your own printer. Flimsy and prone to bending.

Other than that seems to be pretty decent C&C entry.

Another great C&C game but also very good with Art of Tactic rules.  I really like how two games are incorporated in one buy.  The C&C rules are a very good variation and balance of some of the best C&C games I love (BattleLore & Ancients).

The AoT rules are cool and I'm able to play them solo with decent enjoyment.  Beside putting the models together I am pleased with this game(s) all around.

I've only played the C&C rules. It is a good game that neatly combines aspects of other C&C titles with its own twists and creates a package that fits its theme very nicely. The Dragon cards and Honour & Fortune tokens in particular are what really differentiate it from other C&C games and I'm glad I own it but it has some major problems, all of which are related to production. The miniatures are gorgeous but painfully time consuming to prep, out of proportion to the return on play value, and are problematic to store and transport. Perhaps I am spoiled by GMT, but the release schedule has been slow and most expansion material and additional mini packs are not available locally. Scenario options are also very limited, although I have designed some of my own. This game could be a real winner but I suspect it might not get there. I do hope to try the Art of Tactics rules at some stage and that may increase its value for me.

Edit 11.6.17: I've now gone deep into the game, creating fan scenarios for half a dozen Sengoku Jidai battles, as well as a 30 battle rule and scenario pack for the Genpei War, which can be found in the Files section of the game's page. The simplicity of the C&C system is a great vehicle for players wanting to explore history through scenario design. With the P500 of C&C:Medieval appearing, I'm pessimistic about Samurai Battles ever seeing rerelease, development and expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Only played Command and Colours, interested in trying the other.
We C&C players know the drill by now, and so far Samurai Battles does not disappoint. The Dragon cards are like a weaker, and hence less swingy, version of lore and are most welcome. The unit differentiation is quite good, despite the relatively small number of unit types.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fewer types of units than other C&C games, so players don't have to worry so much about what each unit does and can focus on gameplay. Really nice thematic tweaks to Richard Borg's amazing system: Honor and Fortune, Seppuku and Dragon Cards complement the Command cards perfectly! 

The minis are nice and I had fun assembling them - difficult to store and fiddly to move, but worth the effort to play with. Painted silver and gold. The cards are terribly thin, but FFG sleeves fixed that. Some minor errata (had to take a pen to change a 2 to a 3 on a card). Rulebook is a 'wall of text', but straightforward enough. 

Publisher did a terrible job of ensuring that enough minis came with the game. For some scenarios, one needs to use pieces from the other side.

I liked how the Dragon cards provided a twist on the core C&C Ancients game play, but I felt like the physical components and presentation were a big let down.  

The miniatures are extremely brittle and easily damaged.  The six piece board (with nothing to hold the pieces together) is worse than an unmounted map.  There are only a handful of scenarios and over half of them relate to Kawanakajima.  This is a pretty terrible value for the money players are asked to invest.

As for the Dragon cards, I like spreading the special action love out (rather than leaving it to lucky draws from the core command deck), but the honor & fortune mechanic does have the problem of making a rich player get richer, which is already a big issue with C&C gameplay.

Bought at Spiel 2012.
I've waited and hoped for this game for 6 years, so I was pretty darn exited when discovering it in Essen! 
(It must have flown right under my radar, as it was a total surprise for me...)
The good Zvezda people invited me to try the game, but I was in " Shut up and take my money!" mode already...
Read the rules, and the samurai tweaks to the C&C engine seem very appropriate for that Sengoku Jidai feel...Production value on cards, boards, terrain markers and so on are definitely not as lavish as some of the other C&C offerings, and the somewhat fragile figures are going to take some time putting together, but who cares!? It's C&C SAMURAI!!!
Also bought 2 boxes of samurai with no-dachi. No rules for the C&C system were included, and no scenarios using these figures are available yet...

From a components standpoint, this is my least favorite of the Command and Colors series (and I have played them all).  I am not a miniatures enthusiast and these were a pain to put together and are very fragile when the game is in progress.  The cards are also sub-standard and even the Command and Colors rulebook seems an afterthought compared to the full color rules for Art of the Tactics.  The C&C game is decent -- a bit of the lore system from Battlelore with the battle-back, support and leaders rules from other incarnations combined with an interesting honor mechanism that is intended to model the disgrace of retreat in this setting.  I bought this game for the Command and Colors rules but have also played the Art of the Tactics introductory scenario.  I found it to be quite dull with all of the troops quickly glommed together in melee standoffs in the middle of the narrow battlefield.  Admittedly, this was only one attempt to learn the basic rules and the game might shine with the advanced rule set and an average sized scenario but the introduction provided seemed poor to me.

Pro: Top notch components overall. I would say the best for a C&C type game. Everything snaps in rather well. Only glue used was due to my own error. I vastly prefer Art of Tactics over C&C, but I know I'm one of the fewer people in that regard. Will only get better with expansions and additional figures.

Con: Far too much set up with the figures compared to what it should be. Case in point, needing to add in an arm on some of the guys when it's just an arm. Seriously, I have to label my own dice with stickers?

Rating based on CC gameplay only.  Once you get past putting the models together the game plays great.  I rate this game lower than Battlelore, Ancients and Napoleonics, but higher than Memoir 44. As a fan of CC games, it's different enough to other CC games to warrant adding to my collection.

I really wish GMT would have done this game.  After one round of play almost all the spears have been broken off, the arrows are bent, and the sashimono (Flags depicting which side they fought for) are falling out.

Great narrative of Zipangu's warring state period in a simplistic but efficient C&C system (annoying rulebook) or scaling AoT one. The production value however is quite uneven as models are outstandingly realistic but brittle, C&C cards are of print & play quality and board textures are the worst but it's still an outstanding value for what you get.

RATING: 4
I deeply respect and admire the Command and Colors franchise. Richard Borg has succeeded in developing some of the most memorable and enjoyable light wargames I've ever played. Coming from a person who doesn't play a ton of wargames, that's high praise indeed. With Samurai Battles, however, something went terribly wrong. 

The board and components let down what might have been one of the best wargames of the entire series. Be aware, I'm a somewhat biased regarding this subject, as components don't do anything special for me. I don't start salivating whenever I see a newly produced piece of plastic, that happens to look like a real world object. Finely detail or not, they don't titillate me. 

For me, the components either work, or they don't. My first rule is that they shouldn't interfere or otherwise detract from the game experience they're intending to promote.

So, here's where this game breaks down for me:

1. The pieces require glue. The snap-together thing doesn't work properly. Stuff falls off. 

2. The pieces are too brittle. They break easily. 

3. The pieces are unwieldy. They fall over easily, and become tangled up in each other. 

4. The pegs for the back banners are ridiculously small, and don't fit properly into the holes. 

5. Missing flags; you know what I'm talking about. 

6. The board is provided in pieces. Why is this an issue? Well, because one nudge will dislocate them, which knocks the soldiers over, and requires realignment of just about everything. 

Good stuff:

1. If you know Command and Colors, then Samurai Battles won't be too tough to learn. 

2. Honor and fortune, leaders, personal duels, etc. The game play feels fresh. It's C&C at its heart, but with a welcome twist, and some more nuanced and interesting gameplay. 

3. The miniatures are superbly detailed. 

So, because the game is Command and Colors, I rate it a 6 — maybe a 7. Because of the component issues indicated above, the rating plummets to a 4. 

I've played pretty much all the games in the series, and this one is by far the weakest in terms of components.

Really enjoy the games from Borg and am a huge miniature gaming fan so this looks like a must for the collection.
Seems like Richard Borg took the best of all the C & C type games (Ancients, Memoir, Battlelore, Battlecry) and put them in this game. Very nice.

Update, so far the games have been really unbalanced, first 3 scenarios favor the red army, then seems scenario 4 flips to the Yellow army as well as the 5th. I find it frustrating but we'll give it another go try and see if this version of the C & C rules are unbalanced. Otherwise we'll give the Tactics a try and hopefully those rules are more pleasure to play.

The Art of Tactics is great, really prefer this system over the C&C rules.

It's C&C, Japanese style. Big box with stacks of detailed minis and a second game system (Art of Tactics).

Out of the box Lacks the overall package polish and finish of M44, Battlelore and Battlecry and I wonder which is worse: stickering hundreds of blocks ala Ancients & Napoleonics or cutting minis off sprues and putting them together?

For the average gamer who doesn't want to spend HOURS assembling minis, stick with another system. The scale of the minis is small and you need to be gentle or risk breaking bits off. You know it's a miniatures game when you have old-school sticker labels for the flags (optional). You know the sort where you soak it in water and slide it off the backing onto the plastic? Yep...and these stickers are tiny. Good luck trying not to tear your hair out.

Still, a welcome addition to the C&C family despite only having a paltry 8 scenarios.

If you're thinking about getting the game, consider picking it up in a trade or second hand where someone has done all the hard work of assembling the miniatures.

Samurai Battles is another great Borg design -- unfortunately, it stops right there and doesn't surpass the rest of his designs in my mind.  The mechanics are thematically and carry through well, but it might just be a combination of the theme and the gameplay, but it doesn't sing to me like the other iterations.  Also, the minis are very, very fragile and difficult to play with.  But a good try and if you're into this time period, this is a winner.

I like Command & Colors but, because of appalling production, I can't recommend this variant at all. 
The game components fall a long way behind either Memoir '44 or the fantastic GMT ancient and Napoleonic versions of C&C: awful flimsy cards, a cheap board that is simply a couple of pieces of card that are just pushed together, and a ton of fragile minis (many of which have to be constructed) in a brittle and uninspiring grey plastic. Add a second variant ruleset that is almost unplayable, and a selection of frankly boring unbalanced scenarios and you have a summary of Samurai Battles. 
I threw away the variant rules, the board, scenery, and all the idiotic minis.  Instead I play on a quality GMT C&C: Ancients board and have printed out some fantastic stickers from the BGG files section (thanks!) and stuck them to blocks.  All I've kept are the cards, dice and rules.  Not worth the $ I paid. 
The Command & Colors system is hugely fun. Just don't buy this version.

The miniature quality would be amazing if they were meant for display. However, they're not - they're meant to be handled, and for that reason they're terrible. I was in constant fear of snapping off a spear or arrow. Card quality and board quality are also pretty bad. 

C&C game doesn't feel particularly interesting - basically Battlelore in Japan, which you can excuse because "the mystical Orient", I guess. I guess?? I have yet to try the Art of Tactic game.

Update: I think Battlelore 2e does almost everything better than the C&C version of this. I am tempted to trade or sell it but I don't think the minis would survive shipping now that they've been assembled. I want to play the AoT game before I make a final decision, though.

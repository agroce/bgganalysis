For me, it´s the best racing game. Easy rules, great looking cars and very big tracks (The size of the tracks could be a problem for standard tables). Low dice luck, because you can "change" your dice throws.
With some extra rules like car setup and weather the game is perfect. I like it.

Spectacular production values but you are at the mercy of the dice. The time limit is intersting but you can use this rule with any racing game. Speed Circuit is still the best racing game.

RATING: 10
VERY COOL.  Timer is mandatory.  A very fun race "simulation"...really makes you feel the pressure and intensity.

We typically play 3-lap races, 30-second timer.  No white flags.  If you go over your time, just continue your turn.  You miss your next turn as a penalty (no flag).

{1 play, 6 players} I think if I played this a lot, I'd like it less, but so far I really love this one.  The genius of it is that the rules are quite simple, and they need to be since you're under the gun on each turn.  We played the "basic" 20 seconds, and I can't imagine playing only 15 as some do!  Yipes.  My only quibble was that it was almost always okay to roll all 3 dice, but maybe this is more of a factor with other tracks.

OK. Nice looking game. Also, has the formal rule that you only have ~15 seconds for your turn, which should be mandatory in most race games. But this ended up being too nice to bring to the table (and not such a great game), so I sold my copy.

Perhaps the nearest board game approximation of auto racing. You have just seconds to roll your dice, place them in the gear box and count out your moves. Try not to screw up too badly. Expensive (since most of the game is the poster-sized maps) but worth tracking down. A different experience than Formula D.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! When introducing new players to the game, I teach them the movement rules and penalties, then I let them run a short track with no timer so that they get a solid feel for the mechanics.  We then play the full game with time enforced.  I've taught DM to about 30 people at gaming conventions and local game days, and all but 2 players said they really enjoyed it and wanted to play again.  Probably the most requested race game I own.

RATING: 4
I tend to like games with unusual elements (games like TAMSK, Saturn, Carabande, Polarity, etc.), but this one I must admit didn't do very much for me even with the interesting timing rules. It seems like the die rolls don't limit your control very much, so you can usually do more or less whatever you want, making the game almost purely tactical. That would be OK, but the tactics really aren't *that* deep and I find that it just goes on far, far too long for a game that hasn't got all that much content.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best simulation of a racing game ever!  The timer is a necessity, as it forces you to make decisions quickly.  Even the tiniest mistake can hurt you big time, just like in a real race!  It's also very challenging to make a pass if you're starting from the back of the pack.  Great, great game!

RATING: 8
Now this is a game that surprised me! I never thought I would like racing games, and while I don’t think I will love a lot, Das Motorsportspiel was a huge hit (along with Ave Caesar, which is just a filler though)!

I guess that, once again, the real-time aspect is what makes Das Motorsportspiel fun – simply because it’s so tense! You only have 20-30 seconds to make your move once it’s your turn and this is what I love about the game. Sure, you roll dice, so it’s somewhat random, but not a whole lot as you can always decide not to roll all of them, and you can always roll the dice to the other side to change the value. When playing with very strict rules (like we do) it’s so much fun and it’s very hard not to make an error unless you’re really skilled! 
You can make some clever moves by switching lanes (but remember you can only do so on a 2, 3 or 5) or trying to block other players. I would love to play it with 8-10 players, but what I would love even more was to own a copy myself and play it with my family! It is OOP at the moment, but someday it will be mine...

Excellent racing game!

Here, the speed of racing is captured by putting the player "on the clock" each turn. You make your rolls and then assign dice. If you take too long repeatedly there are penalties. If you make an error of judgment (through haste) you get penalty flags.

The lay-out of the track forces you to slow down in the corners. All in all, the game models racing well enough that the theme holds up very well.

Another benefit of the time-limits is that it ensures a limited and brief playing time. I really felt like I'd been in a race after the end of a game. 

I wish there were more varied maps available.  The game does look impressive set up on the table, with the large maps unfolded. The components and production values are off the charts.  This is an under-appreciated gem.

I very much enjoy playing this game, but like sooo many games in collection, it doesn't hit the table very often.  Like Full Metal Planete, it's a real time game, and needs to be played in a semi-strict manner to feel the full force of the game.

RATING: 9
Almost certainly my favorite racing game, and I dig racing games.  It features a wonderful balance between luck and skill.  I was concerned about the use of a timer, as I generally prefer deliberate play without time pressure, but here it really works exactly as intended and makes for a very fun experience.  Unfortunately, some people in my local group can't stand it -- I suppose it's not for everyone, but you owe it to yourself to at least try it if you get the chance.

There are some slight ambiguities in the rules translation, so make sure you've all agreed on how you'll play before you begin.  Also, the rules as written can force someone to take an extra lap just as they're about to finish, which is ridiculous.  Easily fixable with a house rule, though.

The game includes 6 highly detailed HO-scale (1:87) rally car models.  Collecting more 1:87 vehicles for the garage just adds to the fun. (Walmart carries a line of very nice NASCAR replicas for under $3 apiece.) Incidentally, 1:144 scale tanks work nicely, too.

RATING: 7
I'm not sure whether this is a 6 or 7 for me.  I decided to go with a 7 because it just so clean and fun.  The theme holds up well given the awesome large maps.  Also there several maps probably of varying difficulty.  I'm looking forward to playing this again.  We played with a 9 second timer on arranging the dice...it spiced things up and created a few "uh oh, I shouldn't have done that...{crash}". I can't go any higher w/the rating though because I think it may have a runaway leader problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A brilliant, pure race game against the clock. Roll up to three dice, start a timer, then flip and order your dice, then finally execute your move. No take-backs, once you have moved into a square you must go there! Face penalties for those mistakes, often just forcing a pit stop, which marginally hinders you, but this is a race after all! 

Components are notably top-notch: huge detailed maps, detailed matchbox-style cars! 


After many years of yearning to try, my 'Geekbuddies taught me this classic at BGG.Con 2009, thanks all!

Only in German available, out of print. But there are still some games available, rules are easy to understand. Playable with all 1:87 size cars.

3 official race tracks available, but some more custom tracks (homemade, but some good), available about yahoo group.

We have now 6 tracks for example Indianapolis, Catalunya and Fuji as 100% full size, full colour print out, like the original tracks.

We have three new tracks finished: Hungary Ring, Circuit de Monaco and Suzuka and will post these in a few days (weeks) and a NASCAR Racetrack inspired by the US Sprint Series with additional rules and a lot of surprises... (of course a track for 16 and more cars racing for large teams or big fun events with 8 or more people...!) in working progress. 
More info will follow in some weeks.

Stressful "real time" roll and move that is a lot of fun. Cars are fantastic, board not so much as it's a giant poster that may or may not fit your table and never seems to go completely flat so it's not in a box but a big tube so it's not easy to store.

RATING: 7.5
Only one play so far, but this is a great racing game. I really love the looks of this thing. It's huge map and awesome looking cars all look awesome, during game play.

I really like how the dice are used to control the speed of your car. A very clever mechanic that works well with the game. They use of the timer is brilliant and really makes it feel like a race game, along with the use of the penalty flags and how they affect the game. It all wraps up into one amazing race game, that is unlike any of the others that I've played.

The rule book is a little iffy and could have been done much better. There were a few things here and there, that I was unsure of and the rule book didn't really help much, but I managed my way through anyhow.

I'm liking this game a lot and am really looking forward to more plays. I'll try to update again, once I get more games under my belt, but do know this is a really good racing game and there's plenty of tracks to race on, with the ones that come with the game and a plenty of user created ones here on the geek, that can be printed out and used for game play.

Simple rules make this a challenging game. The more cars, the better, as it is the interaction that makes this race game fun.  The car pawns are the German version of Matchbox, Herpa, and these are highly detailed.  The race track is a very large poster, larger than our std folding table.  I use my 3x7 billiard table for this game.

Best racing game I've played.  The custom Red die is a great implementation of going slow.  The timer is critical for the pace of the game to feel like racing.  Formula De should use a timer and have the 'no go back' rule, too.  That's what house rules are for!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Really like the movement mechanic in this one. Also like the way the correct racing line is represented in the tracks, and how the gearing and lane-chaning mechanics will sometimes have you make a sub-optimal move now to set up the line next move. Great fun when played with a timer. Not nuts about the flag system, but we easily house-ruled it into something that worked for us. Should probably do something about the pitstop rule, too ... rolling through on the red die is a death sentence.

The use of the timer makes this game.  When played with a short time limit, the game does a better job than any other of providing the actual "feel" of racing.  Players must quickly and accurately make real time decisions.  Dice controlled movement but the rules governing how the dice are used allow players to have a considerable impact on the final movement.

this game is pretty interesting, but I played a 2 car per player, 3 lap race and it burned me out.  I had never played before and found the (slightly) more experienced players, one in particular, to be either much better or much luckier than I was.  The timer was brutal (as it should be I suppose) and the track we were on had some harsh turns.  Nothing says the dice hate you as rolling a 3/4 on the one white die you rolled in the "2" turns...

Great system. As compared to Formula D and Speed Circuit,  this does create the "feel" of racing.  Under time pressure, you'll sometimes make mistakes by misjudging a corner, going in too hard when you should have been more cautious, or giving your opponent an opportunity because you thought you were going faster than you were.  The first board game I've played that I'd call truly "addictive."

It has pretty interesting idea of time constraint on players movement. It helps to keep game flowing quickly. Still it does not feel as much as racing game. In this matter I prefer much more Race 90.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a game where you must ruthlessly enforce the rules - and never give mulligans!  The pressure of computing your move and completing it in a brisk manner, along with the "no take backs" aspect of the movement means players tend to crack and make an error.  And, hoo boy, you do NOT want to go through the pits if you don't have to.  Driving through the pits is excruciating, as you slowly pass through - your opponent's are charging away...  I believe this game, when played properly, achieves something of the tension of really driving a race car.  But if you try to be kind, and allow players to correct mistakes or take too much time, all the tension evaporates and you end up with a rather ho-hum roll and move sort of game.  

This is a game that isn't a good fit for some folks.  (The darker side of me wants to play this with the folks who ponder their moves in other games five times longer than I do...)  

I strongly recommend using Micro Machines in replacement of the Herpa cars.  The Micro Machines fit the game spaces much better, and there are many cool cars you can get.  

It is pretty much impossible to play this game sitting down.  Since the game can take a while, depending how many laps you run, this fact can cause some problems.

The big, full-color posterboard you play on is cool, and the the cars reminded me how fun it used to be to play with Hot Wheels.  There's some cleverness in this design -- timed turns give it a frantic feel, and the various rules for racing through curves and avoiding crashes do make you feel like you're racing stock cars.  In the end, though, I can't escape the fact that the game comes down to throwing dice and making the best of what you've rolled.  That's not for me.

my favourite racing boardgame as it forces the player to react quickly as drivers do.  ie. it is possible for the player in the lead to have an accident if he/she is not careful.  Other racing games don't quite generate this level of intensity, though Formula De is a great game too.

Fast-paced racing game where players can roll up to 3 dice to then flip the dice (changing gears) to determine movement.  Played with a timer players must first decide the order of their die rolls before moving cars.  2 of the dice are regular 6-sided the other is a 1,1,2,2,3,3 die (which is always rolled).  

Played with a 1-minute time limit and would like to try with a 30 second timer which I think would be more in the spirit of the game.  Beautiful production with toy replica cars.

You will need a LARGE table for this game. Without a timer to limit the analysis of best possible move this game would be very dull......

Really good fun!

I like it as a concept, but we found that if everyone concentrated, planning moves for the potential results before the roll, very few mistakes were made and typically the leader was very hard to catch, being able to maximise all moves without the stress of having to cope with passing other cars. Best with more players to give a race feel, but that introduces downtime as a result. A tradeoff. A once a year game.

Ha la particolare gestione dei dadi, in cui se non si è soddisfatti del risultato, possono essere capovolti alla faccia opposta. Il gioco è divertente e veloce, in cui contano rapidità, prontezza di riflessi e sopratutto il sapere bene interpretare il percorso. Difficilmente sarete soddisfatti da una corsa singola. Il numero di giocatori non è inoltre limitato dal sistema di gioco, sebbene le vetture (bellissime!) in dotazione siano solo sei; è possibile infatti trovare facilmente altre vetture in scala 1:87 che si possono aggiungere per giocare in più di sei partecipanti. The Best Racing Game!

Certainly fun to play every once in a while.  It has the inherent problem of all race games that the person in front has virtually no interaction, and basically should be able to win easily. The dice flipping and sequencing under time pressure is surprisingly fun, but like most time pressure things, some players will just beat others.  Would need very clever timer settings to put different time pressures on each player to try and level the field.  The concept is fun, simple and well implemented.  Sadly I don't know that is is that engaging to warrant playing more than  few times a year.  May need guns and mine layers....  The large board and cars look spectacular but are not very useful: the cars roll away down lumps in the map, and the size means that you have to play the entire game standing up.  A board 1/6 the size and some wooden blocks for cars would work far better.

Wow.  I really enjoyed this race game.  As Im only a passing fan of most race games, this one struck me as cream of the crop as it really adds a level of excitement with the timed rounds.  So many other race games are ruined by people that play them so much that they really know how to optimally move around the track...  In this one...  they have to make decisions so fast, so it's no surprise that mistakes are made.

Yet another iteration of a racing game, something I really like.  I like to see how the different games handle the uncertainty that is such a part of racing.  This one has some really nice production values, with nice cars and table-sized tracks.  Their use of dice is also interesting, though I am still not sure how I feel about them when compared to MotorChamp, which I do like.  This one seems to suffer more from analysis than MotorChamp, which is a problem.  It seems that playing a reasonable game of this really requires a timer, moreso than other race games.  [03/13/2011]

Great racing game that forces you to actually race through your turn.  The pressure is on as you choose the dice to roll and play them out on the fly.  

While I usually won't have it in games, with this, there are no take backs.  When you move your move.  You need to enforce this.  It is quick and fun and when you crash that's just as much a part of the game.

Oh, and the cars are awesome (though fragile).

1 game (1 lap only)

This is kind of a fun race game, and the only one I've played in which you actually feel time pressure to race! I never got it in my head that you cannot change lanes on a 1 roll, and ended up crashing before even finishing that one lap! Still, the time pressure of doing everything (select and roll dice, make legal moves) within 30 seconds works very well for a race game. I'm not sure, though, that I'd like to play a full game (which BGG says lasts 2 hours)! Maybe once I've internalized the rules better?

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The track is a huge single sheet. Players start in designated positions. Each round, take turns from front to back. On your turn (timed; 30 seconds seems popular), which starts when you pick up the dice (2 regular d6, 1 d6 with only values 1-3), you must roll 1-3 d6 and use those to move your car following several rules:
- MAY flip dice to their opposite face
- put dice in a sequence; use each one, in sequence, fully
- ONLY forward movement (no sudden lane changes, backups, NO TAKEBACKS)
- lane changes only allowed with dice showing 2, 3, or 5
- track sections showing speed limits (e.g., turns) may only be moved through with dice showing that speed or fewer pips
Your turn ends immediately (with car in current position) if you make any errors or run out of time. Depending on the severity of your mistake(s), you get different colored flags (a bunch of minor errors can convert to more severe colors). With enough severe errors, you're out of the race.

In a single lap race, of course, the first to cross Finish wins.

This is a homemade version. When I quickly realized that getting an official copy was going to be a problem, I printed out a copy of the Indianapolis map on 24 sheets of paper, and taped it together.  I found a set of the Micro Machines 1996 Indy Starting Grid, and used poker chips for the flags.  The last part was buying some blank dice from the local KnowPlace, so that the d3 could be set up correctly. (1 3, 2 3, 1 2)

I have to admit I was impressed with the game.  There's luck, but it's controlled by the ability to flip the dice over.  It's also pretty easy to make a mistake.  I'm wondering if I played the 'error' portion of the game correctly, since the errors seemed pretty catastrophic.

The thing I was most impressed by was how the dice ended up giving the right feel to the game. It became very obvious when a car went into the pits. Since it was required to use the lower side of each die, the speed looked right compared to the cars blazing past on the straight.

I just wish I could easily get an official copy here in the USA. =P

Update: I managed to get an official copy, finally. As a birthday gift, no less. =)  I'm really impressed with the quality of the cars included. The detail on them is astounding.  I may stick to using my Indy MicroMachines, since they appear be a little tougher.  The tracks available for the game look great, too. I apparently was given an extra copy of one of the tracks...an unexpected bonus.

I'm open to trying just about any game from any genre, but in the past few years have begun to realize that two genres tend to bore me, those being racing games and deduction games. This racing game attempts to alleviate the boredom of rolling dice to move around a track by mandating quick turns with no counting out or take-backs, and it succeeds to some extent. Yet I'd still rather be playing just about any other type of game than a racing game, whether it's cars or horses or boats or what have you. For racing fans, of which there must be many given the proliferation of this genre, this is a potential golden oldie worth checking out.

At first glance, this is "Just another race game"; roll the dice and move your cars.  Then you realize that each move is made under strict time limits.  Then you realize that you're not allowed to back up your cars after moving them forward.  Then you realize that you're not allowed to use your hand to count out your movement before moving your car, and the game tightens up a notch or two.  The way that players can flip and organize their dice gives the game a slight edge, as well.  It's not a difficult game, and in fact, it's easy to count out your move from a distance and anticipate the numbers you'll need for your turn before rolling the dice, but the different restrictions in the game help make it feel like you're making critical decisions at high speeds, making the race game a bit more thematic than other race games.  Very nice.

I was finally able to pick this beauty up in a trade.  I love the timing mechanic and how that really makes you have to use the dice in the best possible way.  My buddy David refuses to play this game because of the timing element, but I think it makes this game better than the rest.  I also love the cars that come with it.

Have to distinguish between my own rating and how my group liked this game: my own rating is a 7 or maybe 8 but it wasn't loved by veryone here in our group. It takes quite some commitement to run around with a timer ticking... Not everyone's cup of tea but certainly a cool game if you're looking for some racing action. The cars are so beautiful - (great little DTM cars by a miniatures manufacturer)

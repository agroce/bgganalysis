Played twice (2016.04) and enjoyed very much. 

Escale: Each unit = regiment.
1 turn - 1 day. Each turn is divided in several small area impulses.
The game use exactly the same system of "Not War but Murder" and "Birth of a Legend" both by ATO. 
The feeling of this particular system is slightly different from other titles of the same family Area-impulse (Storm over....).
Both sides roll attack & defence and units do not get spend after activation.
The duration of the turn is decided during the british impulse by die roll and can bring the turn end unexpectedly. This turn mechanic brings alot of stress to both players.
The variable number of activations by turn, the implications with weather changes, the mercurial die roll combat & Barrage results, the artillery & tank refit, all contribute to the replayability of the game.
The Haig roll can be a anticlimax but brings a great pressure on the Allied to focus and achieve the objectives on the ground. If Haig is in bad mood the British has exactly three turns (spending initiative) to take the critical gound and unsure a + 4 drm to the Haig Decision dr.
Players must be aware of the operational limitations and movement restritions to the British during turns 1 and 2.
In Cambrai both sides will found the keys to break the deadlock of the Western Front with the use of armour and modern infantry infiltration tactics.
Curiously the designer focused on the british offensive  (and the use of Tanks) and passed over the other half of the battle and the role of the german shock tactics and stoss.  
Anyway, the game is fantastic and plays fast and we are willing to bring this title to the table again.
Probably the rating will go higher with more plays.
I would like to see more 1WW games using the same system.
The duration of the match may vary depending on the will and mood of general Douglas Haig and the scenario chosen ... 1-3 hours.
Components, map, counters, rules and player aid are Ok.

RATING: 8
Extremely cool game from the master of area-impulse games.  He really captures the history in the game and adds a clever idea with the Haig roll.  Both sides are challenged: the Allies have the power, but have to press hard and quick.  Deep strategy with a simple rules set: vintage Rinella!

Interesting area based war game. Balanced play with very different strategies for both players but not static as you would expect of WWI

RATING: 7
Breakthrough: Cambrai shares many mechanics with Rinella's other area impulse games.  Despite that, it has a distinctive feel of the Great War; the critical importance of artillery, potent yet brittle early tanks, tactical inflexibility represented by the British operational sectors, and, after three years of bloody stalemate, Haig's reluctance to press on with the offensive if key objectives were not captured.

The game offers the British player multiple conundrums, from how to use his artillery most effectively, to the best use to make of limited impulses, to grappling with the constraints of those operational sectors.  I think it is less interesting for the German.  The key for him in the early turns is to prevent a British breakthrough victory and to hang on to the Haig objectives for as long as possible, while taking a dreadful pounding.  Take comfort from your unhistorical knowledge of British limitations and objectives.

The Haig objectives and the operational sectors do script the action in certain ways.  However, the combat system, weather and ammunition rolls all offer lots of variability.  Plus, we're offered German counter-attack and campaign scenarios, so I shouldn't grumble.

The rule book is poorly organized and several key rules are only to be found in the Playbook or in errata.  Production quality is to MMP's usual standards.  I quite like the counter and map artwork.  The failure to name the two canals when one of them marks the border of a Haig objective is baffling.

A lot of little problems added up on this one.

Historical believability suffers from the combat capabilities
of cavalry, discarding of all artillery ammo each turn,
and the temporal abstractions inherent in the area-impulse
design.

Competitive play is hindered somewhat by the circumstances -
most of the tough interesting decisions are for the Brits.
Indeed, the game feels somewhat like a puzzle design,
wherein the UK has to try and figure out how to avoid
Haig giving up, whilst still progressing on their own
goals toward victory.

Finally, the rules were an even bigger challenge for me
than usual. Not in learning them, but in trying to remember
the special cases. Presentation could be better (more
cross-references and better organized player aids especially).
Area and P2P systems are always more painful to express
than hex-based ones though.

Still, I had a lot of FUN with it, once I had the rules
(mostly) memorized. It was just painful getting there.

RATING: 9
Have played several times now, and I rather like this one: compact, fast-playing, and with a good sense of the battle. It's also got a *very* different feel to the other games of this type, Breakout: Normandy and Monty's Gamble. I wish the rulebook was a little better, but it's not that bad and better than many, and I think it's significantly more playable than Monty's Gamble. We've been lucky this year (2011) in getting a number of really high-quality short wargames (this, No Retreat!, Sekigahara).

Quick tip: for the British, there is a nasty one-game learning curve here. One big thing is knowing when to break out the big sledgehammer (i.e., commit a lot of direct fire support artillery) and when to persist in low-odds attacks to clear an area. You need to create gaps to pressure the German defense, but you also need to take a lot of areas which implies a broader offensive. You've got to get a foothold in Area 1 to satisfy Haig, but you should wait until Day 2. Concentrate on releasing at least some of your reserves on impulse 0 with a sledgehammer blow overrun with lots of artillery support.

There is a fair amount of luck in the game, and if you are badly unlucky during the first night - no Hurricane Barrages come back, minimal artillery support, lots of lost tanks - you can be pretty hosed. But that's unlikely and there are a lot of dice in the game, so keep a level head, and take smart risks even when you feel like you're behind the 8-ball. Taking crazy risks is never a good idea. You only need a few good risks to pan out to get on a roll. The swapping rules let you risk some low-odds attacks hoping for a big swing without sacrificing much.

You'll probably ultimately use your cavalry to refresh infantry divisions, but try to keep them around and threatening for a couple days. A mild cavalry breakthrough, even though easily contained/destroyed, can give the Germans real headaches in terms of juggling his units in the line.

2 plays solo
4 FtF

It takes three plays as the British to even begin to *get* how to handle these new landships.

These are not the fast, "reliable" panzers of the next war but rather temperamental beasts.  And much like their historic masters, the new gamer will need time, trial and error to begin to see how to utilize the tanks in concert with his other forces.

And that's a very good thing.  Rinella has captured an aspect of Cambrai I never expected, the challenge of how best to utilize the tanks.

My advice for the newbie ... try, try again.  I've found my methods, enjoy finding your own.

And when a turn is done, and the tanks roll for recovery, you'll Harrah! for each counter in a critical location that recovers without loss, and groan for each that diminishes.  For as the tanks go, so goes your offensive.

Artillery is also handled differently here than in most A/I titles.  The critical new use is that of the rolling barrage - so important in the historic battle.  Its use is critical to success ... I'll let you discover how.

Last bit of advice for the new British player ... do not use the advantage.  Period.  Oh, you'll think you have good reasons.  You'll think it's crucial.  But you *will* need the advantage to change Field Marshall Haig's mind on the evening of November 21st, or you will lose in two turns.

And to be fair, aspects like the Haig decision roll will drive you nuts.  I still hate the organizational restrictions, which tie the gamer to a plan other than their own for the first two turns.  Historic perhaps but maddening none-the-less.  Once you start to see how to use the tools you have as the British attacker ... the restrictions of the historic plan somehow seem less imposing.

It is also a bit ... hokey that the German player knows exactly what areas your offensive is initially constrained to, as well as what makes Haig happy.  Long term, I don't think this bodes well for play against experienced, or simply observant, German players.

Bottom lines 

B:C succeeds in capturing aspects of the historic operation, in ways that might surprise you.  Like its best relatives in the A/I family B:C succeeds in imparting a sense of movement to a historic situation that was hardly filled with "sweeping maneuver" and as one would expect from the pedigree it presents the gamer (particularly the British player) with tense decisions every impulse ... and the German player often plays the role of spoiler for the first half of the game.  If the Brits draw the game out without winning, the Germans get a serious chance to counterattack.

It is maddening, challenging, and impossible for the first several plays as the British.

Without the advantage to change Haig's mind, it can be a *very* short game.  The British must win early, and if they do so, B:C is one of the shortest A/I games out there.

Avoid the tendency to judge B:C during the first few plays.  Practice the game solo as the British player.  Discover the tactics necessary to play both sides. Enjoy the epiphanies. 

--------
Follow-on comment after four plays.  B:C shares an interesting aspect in common with another Rinella A/I design, Monty's Gamble:Market Garden.  Both are very good A/I games, quite short in duration and with a definite "beat the clock" element for the Allies.  I enjoy both games when they hit the table, but I do have to be in the "right mood" to want to place them on the table.  As I am still exploring B:C but my hope is that it will stand the test of time, and even rise in rating as MG:MG has done.

--------
After 5 plays
I have two problems with this game, the Haig decision and the limits on British divisional operations.

The British player will win this game in the first four turns if at all.  To do this, he must win the Haig die roll once, and spend the advantage another time to divert Haig.  Period.  If he does not, he will lose.  Put another way, against competent, not brilliant mind you, merely competent German play, the Brits are virtually guaranteed to lose if they do not win one of the two Haig die rolls on turn 2 and 3.

This can be difficult to achieve as the German player has perfect knowledge of the British operational plan, specifically of the constraints on operational movement imposed on British divisions on turns 1 and 2.  A competent German player will use this knowledge, particularly during turn 2, when the German lines are beginning to wear thin.  He can use this knowledge to reinforce only those areas the Brit can actually assault, to the point of removing units from Areas that are adjacent to other British units which e knows can not attack the diluted area.

In competent hands, this perfect knowledge really makes a difference which feels totally wrong.

Its a fun game that really challenges the British player, but repeated play has dropped it in my opinion.

RATING: 8
Area - Impulse game about famous Haig's "armored" offensive in 1917 on Western Front. Very good and enjoyable game with minimum rules to grasp. Tight victory conditions, which forces both sides to take agonizing decisions every impulse. High replayability due to sudden-death mechanism. Significant luck factor, but manageable odds when we need maximum effort.
First two turns could be deciding with swing of luck (dice).

A lighter, quicker version of [i]Breakout: Normandy[/i] with its own twists. The area/unit restrictions, combined with fewer areas, probably mean there's going to be limited replayability, but I still think there's enough variation for a half dozen plays at least. Thumbs up.

Rules are easy to pick up , especially if you are familiar with any previous area-impulse games; though be mindful of sneaky modifiers (examples 1st turn, weather, Hurricane Barrage DV modifiers...).

After a few plays, I don't think the 1st two turn "operational sector" constraints are not that constraining.   The Brits have nothing else to do but bash forward and the Germans have to weather it.  The Brit cannot bash everywhere so the German still has to guess where the Brit may go.

I'm happy to have it and recommend others to play it.

RATING: 9
There are many adaptation of the area-impulse system to reflect the attrition and defensive nature of WWI battles in the game. The game is very fast in play and can easily be finished within 2-3 hours which makes it a good candidate for tournament play and if your are short on time and in an evening you can probably fit two games in swapping sides. For me this is one of the more interesting battles of WWI and the implementation of the tanks, bridges, air support and artillery support all accurately reflect their application and strengths in the real battle. There is no doubt that hex and counter systems with much more detail movement will create a more accurate mobility model, I think the compromise that is area-impulse with its speed of play by abstracting movement is perfect for the relatively static combat of WWI. I really like this game and I think it will soon become the WWI version of the classic Breakout Normandy. Mighty shoes to fill!

I will give this game a 9 out of 10, for an excellent implementation of the area-impulse system to WWI, fast and fun with lots of WWI specific flavor. A tall order to perform for any game, especially one about the western front in WWI!

+9.0 for excellent production values, a relatively balanced but asymmetric scenario that is both fun for two players or solitaire. (Any future balancing issues with more game play can be easily be offset by a bidding system provided in the rules.). 

-1.0 for the longevity of the tanks which seem a little non-historical, which doesn't affect gameplay at all. It is also difficult to form a cohesive offensive and defensive fronts, because of the area nature of the map, things can get rather chaotic quickly and it is relatively easy to slip between holes between enemy areas, it is difficult to close all the holes because of the lack of impulses to do all that you want to do. But this does leave the game more fluid and each turn you're wracked with too few actions left but too many options!

Area Impulse.  Similar, but step up in difficulty from Storm of Stalingrad.

I think MMP is a great publisher and I've firmly jumped on the bandwagon enjoying (and buying) many of their titles.  I'm not certain I want to get this one and support this designer.  With so many games to play and buy, there is one less royalty for...

You clearly have no idea how this business operates, or its problems. 

Leaving aside all the books purchased for research, and the time and expense of creating a prototype, I could spend half a day just going over "nuts and bolts" issues like:

1. An artist who lives in Spain and doesn't speak English well tasked with creating a highly detailed map (based on the original trench maps I purchased myself from the Imperial War Museum) whose geography is full of names in French. You cannot begin to imagine the communication difficulties. 

2. No promotion other than some sample artwork created in like 2006. At no compensation and much time and pesonal expense I research historical images and edit them into a promotional video uploaded to You Tube.

3. A four year wait while the game reaches it's "pre-order" numbers. Why four years? Many reasons, which I won't detail, but see again the first sentence of #2, above. 

4. A two year delay in publication, most of it due to trying to figure economies of scale with other print runs to publish the game, as designed, with one inch counters. Eventually the effort is simply abandoned, yielding 5/8" counters I never intended.

5. I am in the middle of several other other projects and suddenly files I haven't looked at in years are dumped in my lap for proofing "a.s.a.p" (I said over and over don't you do it and - yup - they did it). Incidentally we uploaded the map at my insistance for public viewing and NOT ONE PERSON pointed out the canal names were missing.

6. Considerable time and effort spent, again with no compensation, producing a Living Rules PDF posted just weeks after publication. Ditto on the Player Aid Card. There have been no additions to the Living Rules since September of 2011. The rules are solid. 

I've barely started. More than half decade of work before I saw one penny (I doubt I will accept a royalty based contract again and have begun accepting only a flat-fee, paid on acceptance for publication). You people standing on the outside of the "black box" really have no idea what's going on. Getting a game in print is more work than you can imagine.

Update: And then, when someone dares to voice a less than glowing opinion about his game, here is a cut and paste out of the designer's response to the review:

 "You people standing on the outside of the "black box" really have no idea what's going on."

There was more to it, but the belittling really stuck with me. How does the fact that I didn't enjoy the game have anything to do with my lack of understanding of how the creative process works? Am I supposed to change the grade from a C to an A because of the designer's hardships? 

Pretty classy. I'll never buy another game designed by this man. Dropped rating from a '4' to a '1' simply due to the unbelievable arrogance and unprofessionalism of the designer. Change from a C to an F.

This clearly has Breakout: Normandy as its foundation (in terms of the mechanics), with some interesting sophistication built on top of that system.

But the British are in a straight jacket, attempting to wriggle out of it before a timer goes off at the end of turn 1.

I will try to explain:  to survive into the next turn, the British must pass a "Haig Decision" roll at the end of each turn.  To pass they need a 7 or better on 1d6 - so they need positive modifiers.

To earn positive modifiers they must contest or control various specified areas.

On turn 1, the British attacking forces are limited to various pre-designated areas, which limit their ability to co-ordinate or focus on advantageous lines of attack.  Moreover, the bulk of their forces are prevented from entering most of the areas where the positive modifiers for the Haig roll are (or those areas are a long way in the German rear).

The result is that, whilst it is possible for the British to contest or control some of the Haig sensitive areas, they would need to do well on turn 1 to have more than a 67% chance of the game continuing into turn 2, and in all likelihood will be facing a 33% to 50% roll.

I have not played enough to say what might reasonably be expected, with competent British and German play, on turn 1, and what a sensible expectation might be of earning Haig modifiers on that turn.  But it looks like a big hill to climb to me based on my early experiences.

Partly that is the result of an imbalance in the adverse consequences of bad luck on turn 1.  If the British have a big win on the dice in one of their early attacks, two or three Germans units may retreat, be exhausted or die - but because of the British movement restrictions the resulting gaps can probably be filled, perhaps not easily but in some fashion.

If the Germans have a big win on the dice in defending an early British attack, the result can be catastrophic, because reaching the deep objectives needs the British infantry to remain fresh after an attack.

So I am a bit sceptical about this having now given it a bit of a run.  It plays very smoothly, has well written rules and lovely components - but I am not sure that the ebb and flow is structured quite right.

My scepticism ultimately led me to sell the game not long after posting the above comment.

Some more additions to the Area Movementsystem, espicially you can move units, which are not disrupted after the move. Drawback are the fixed lines of advancement for the Brits at start, which allow the Germans to leave some areas open without risk. A good idea is to have three steps for the british tanks, which gives a good feeling for reality.

Breakthrough:  Cambrai is a quick-playing depiction of this important World War One battle.  Easy to learn and play, but always challenging, both players have the opportunity to take the offensive.  Players may choose from scenarios of different lengths to suit their available gaming time.  The uncertain number of impulses during each turn, and sudden death victory conditions in the form of the “Haig Decision die roll,” create a tense and exciting depiction of one of the most important battles of the First World War.  Not for anyone who wants ahistorical choices over simulation value.  Modal rating of "8" after more than six years in print.     

The battle of Cambrai, fought in November and December of 1917, represented a fundamental change in twentieth-century warfare.  It demonstrated the value of tanks on the battlefield, something that until then had been the subject of great debate.  In addition to including the first mass use of tanks in combat, Cambrai featured the initial use of unregistered artillery fire.  The close cooperation between tanks, infantry, artillery, and air power anticipated the “blitzkrieg” tactics commonly used during the Second World War.  At Cambrai the British overcame the bloody quagmire of trench warfare, breaking through what was thought to be one of the most impregnable portions of Germany’s Hindenburg Line in only a few hours.  The speed of the breakthrough came as a surprise to both sides.  Unfortunately, the British had not allocated adequate reserves to exploit their initial gains.  The Germans soon recovered from the shock of the sudden breach of their defenses and launched a counter-attack that recaptured most of the ground previously lost.

RATING: 7
Fiddly in places, and fragile in the opening turns (the British can do everything right and still get shut out by the dice), but most playings should yield a broad brushstroke picture of Cambrai. The breakthrough always seems just out of reach; for the Germans, the juggernaut initially appears unstoppable.

Extremely nice implementation of the area impulse system. The game plays smooth with a good pace. Light enough that you can throw it down and play a full game on a weeknight but still has a good historical depth to it. It's pretty clear after playing this the designer did his historical research.

The lack of appropriate labels for the canal, and the absence of a compass rose aside, I liked the feel of this game. The counters and map give a nice period feel and the fact that the Allied player has to get cracking from the get-go mirrors the actual battle reasonably well.

This was the first area movement/impulse game I purchased so it took a while to get used to it.  Once I caught on I found it quick to play (120 min).  There are some nice historical touches that can influence play.  The best British strategy is to push hard early and hope for a breakthrough and if not to consolidate to win on points.  The Germans do best with a controlled withdrawal to start otherwise they are sent reeling if they try to hold.  Their opportunity to push back comes later.  This game encouraged me to buy other area movement/impulse games.  I would still rate this near the top.

The concepts from the early Area / Impulse games are largely present and the tweeks and changes to cover a WWI game feel right. 

The components are very nice (though there has been an issue with some counters splitting) and the rulebook is particularly well written, with care having been taken to avoid the types of ambiguities that can so easily creep in to rule sets.

The Haig die roll has the potential to be a bit of a party spoiler, bringing the game to an early close, but is does focus the British player on working hard to get critical objectives and the German player on denying them. The game does keep both players equally engaged throughout.

I found myself using the landships in 'penny packets' of one! to avoid them going spent en masse, I am not sure whether that reflects the historical use or not.

Bottom line, this is a good competative game, nicely presented and offering good value for its money. fans of the Area / Impulse games will be happy / intigued at the combination of classic Area / impulse game and new tweeks. The early ending of a game by the Haig die roll may frustrate some. I think the game will come out often and will always play (at least once) in an evening.

EDIT - I have enjoyed further plays and this game is getting good support from the designer.

I want a game rated because of your opinion of the game, not your opinion of the publisher, designer of delivery system.
I suggest this,  because this  is the underlying consensus behind  the BGG rating system, IMHO. 
All those "Meh"s sure have a reason for being there but I would wish that such discussions could be saved for the forums.
I acknowledge the grievances of "the issue" (insults are insults,nevertheless), but as a game player, mainly interested in the game not some "human-failure-and-conflict" overhead I want to equalize the battleground, so I rate this game a 10. My objective-subjective personal rating would probably a 7.5.

So it’s nothing terrible, but it’s nothing that is very exciting either.  Rules are simple and game play is pretty quick.  Low counter density.  But it just gets a big “Meh”.  If you need something quick to play to finish an evening after you played something else, or just want to play a game in one evening that will likely allow you to play both sides, this may be it.

As the Brits you need a big GT1, while as the Germans you just need to eek out an existence so the reinforcements can arrive and the Brit tanks can breakdown.  Once those two things happen – and if they happen at the same time – the game gets very slow paced and methodical (insert WW1 jokes here).

Short of playing this at the FLGS when time is short, not sure this is jumping off the shelf any time soon.

My grandfather fought in this battle (14th Argyll & Sutherlanders, 120 Infantry Brigade, 40th Division), but his unit's counter was not enough for me to keep the game. Rather dull for the Germans, except in the extra scenario when they are on the offensive, which is dull for the British. There wasn't a grand campaign scenario linking the two, though it would have been a game of two halves.

Don't know why I waited so long to play this one.  I'm not really a big fan of area movement games but I really like this one.  As others have said here, you need a couple games under your belt to make decent advances with the British.  The Germans are easier to play, but if the Brits make solid advances early on you will need to launch counter-attacks to prevent losing via VP count.  It's a challenge gathering forces to do this as most of the time the German divisions are really spread out trying to plug holes early in the game.

I've seen a couple of complaints about the tank attrition being too severe, but I think it's just about right as you're really scrambling to muster tanks for a final push in the Bourlon Wood area when the pressure is on to breakthrough.

The Haig rule also seems to be a sore spot with some, but remember that confidence wasn't very high with many in the high command and the public was not in the mood for more horrible losses for no gain.  If you don't make solid efforts to secure the flanks (even contesting them is good enough) then you're deviating from what the plan was too much.  I also like the feel of the divisional objectives as it provides a realistic feel to the operation, i.e., you don't have partial divisions running all over the place in different directions just get get another counter or two in an area... keeping the divisions together and pushing ahead as a unit just feels right.

I've played 5 games this week, it plays quickly (3 hrs or so) and the rules are solid with only a couple of minor items in the errata.

Did I say that I like this game?

This is a provisional rating after one play.

A friend and I played through the first Turn and really enjoyed it. We made some mistakes, particularly with regards to what constitutes an assault, but this didn't detract from our enjoyment. The basic game mechanics are solid and there are some nice touches in the rules to provide that extra bit of historical flavour. The game components are also very good.

I expect that this game will get better with further plays.

On a related note: if you are thinking about buying this game, please ignore the childish "1" ratings. Whatever individuals may think about the game designer, ratings should be about the game.

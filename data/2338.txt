130929 Not a bad 2P game, but it does run long and it makes it hard to get to the table. Plus the card memory aspect kind of is a turnoff.  As much as I hate having paper and pencil on the table, if I play this again, I'm going to play that you can take notes.

100419 A little fiddly, but fun.  Definitely much longer than you'd expect given the small box.

Starship Catan is definitely a Catan game. The resource generating, exploring aspects are all here, the developing in a specific style is here, the element of luck is here... but where is the fun? The first two times I played this wrong, but even on the third playing with correct rules, we felt the game lacked something. I guess when it comes down to it is that there's not enough enjoyment for the time required (about 1.5 hours). The system is good, there's no doubt about that. I just wish I cared more about the outcome of the game.

UPDATE: traded for Knizia's Lord of the Rings co-op game.

A variation of the cardgame Catan, with more balance: cards are shared and if you have memory, you can have as much information as your opponent. You have to analyse the possibilities on trade planets... But still a game of luck!

Only played this a few times and I don't think I've ever finished an entire game.  It's a two-person game and my most notable memory was that the game provided opportunities for lots of technology upgrades.  What those technology upgrades get you totally escapes me.

A fun 2-player game!  I love the artwork and theme.  Gameplay is easy to grasp and moves well.  The game is prone to having a clear winner.  I read elsewhere that once someone builds 3 advanced modules, it's very likely that they will win the game.  That seems true.

All-in-all, a very fun game.  I highly recommend it, particularly if you're into spacefaring.  Well worth a shot.

I'm not a sci-fi fan at all, but the theme in this game is just so well presented that I couldn't help but like it. There is a strong luck element, however, but that doesn't really detract from this light game. What IS annoying, though, is the need for a good memory to recall what cards are in what stack, which is a little challenging for me...especially after midnight!

RATING: 8
Some rules to get into, but luckily I was taught this game. If you have played Settlers of Catan and or Starfares of Catan, this is not hard to get hang of. Ok mechanics, though the trading module might seem to be a bit intimidating especially when you're low on a resource.

Doesn't seem too many ways to win, as you need to get a bit of everything to have enough victory points.

This is a game I rather like but seldom get to play, and with the discovery of recent expansions to this game makes it all the more desirable to play.  I am always looking for nice little two player games to enjoy with my wife (too bad this is not one of them) and other friends (and coworkers on a slow Sunday evening) and this game tends to do quite well to fill the time.

RATING: 6
I love the deck "exploration" mechanic, but, after only a few plays, the game feels very processional and "obvious" to me.  I think winning depends upon simply finding the right card or two, as opposed to having some sort of strategy. [inital rating: 5.5] Wow, it's been years since I've played this, and it's definitely better than I remember... but not by much.  You kinda have to go for those module upgrades as fast as possible, it seems.  If your opponents gets too many of them, it seems hard to catch up.

it's a little visually busy.  kind of heavy feel/game length for a little kosmos box.  although it has memory elements, they could be eliminated with a house rule that allows paper journalling of what's in the decks.  i think it's technically a solid game.  the tutorial rules are absolutely fantastic for learning the game.  i just never wanted to play it.

RATING: 6
A nicely produced 2-player game.  Player interaction is pretty limited, but the mechanisms at least give the opponent someting to do on the other player's turn.  Players compete to collect the resources needed to upgrade their ship to a point where the ship can return home.  There is a memory element to the play that favors those that are good at card counting.  Game play is a tad slower than desired, so be prepared for the game to take the full duration.

I really like this game.  People judge it prematurely.  One play is not enough, you need to play this at least 2 to 3 times to get it.  Not a light game, I would never consider playing a non-gamer.  Still, this is an excellent game.  Sits alongside Elasund as a favorite 2-player Catan game.

Nice theme. Memory plays a big role in this game, you really have to remember which sector (1 of 4 decks of cards) to go to, if you don't you'll end up taking more time playing and not taking the advantage of using the right cards at the right moment. Maybe it takes a little too long for what it is. Still, it's an enjoyable game.

Quite a good little two-player game although it is perhaps a little long for what it is.  There is a LOT of luck and memoisation of which cards are in which space sector (pile of cards)  

The designer Klaus Teuber has kindly released three free print and play expansions that use most of the mechanics (and a few extra cards you need to print out).

Mission 2: The Asteroid, is actually better than the base game. 

Only problem is that I can't squeeze the extra cards into the tiny Kosmos box that barely contained the original game.

One of the gateway games that got me hooked on boardgames (along with Carcassonne & Settlers of Catan).  Didn't buy it for many years because of the price, but finally found it somewhat reasonably reduced and was pleased to purchase it and teach one of my colleagues.  It was as fun as I remembered and look forward to dragging it out more often when only one opponent is available.  [Market price-sale]

The standard Catan Card game with the expansions has more potential, but I also keep gaming this gem. Space pirates, adventure cards, exploring the (card) universe. Playing time is about 80 minutes though which is a little too long to be a complete winner.

I even had 2 copies one Dutch and one English. I held on to the Dutch version as my wife doesn't like playig with English text.

Lots of lovely bits, which don't quite all fit back in the box. A bit tiresome to set up and demands a fair bit of space. So far only one half-game played (with Mrs. Murphy), so provisional rating. {Added 29/5/07): After a couple of plays vs. Frank, this is still a 7. Not quite as much bother to set up as Big City, but still takes us 2 hours or so to play.

Good two player game. It can take some time to get the production engine rolling but it plays a lot quicker than the boardgame and has some nice mechanics. Always a lot you want to do with the little resources you gather. A good memory helps when figuring out where the good buy and sell spots are for the different resources, not to mention the planets for the Galactic council tasks. A two player favorite!

1x 2 player [1-0] *** [180']

(1 play) This is a so-so implementation of the well known Catan game mechanics, but unfortunately one which just doesn't grab me.

The game components are nice albeit a bit overloaded, the setup time takes way too long for a 2 player (non war) game and the playing time is way too long.

We only have played this game once and it has been a close one (10 points vs. 9 points), nevertheless when I want deep space trading, I'd rather choose Avalon Hill's "Merchant of Venus" instead. MoV works well for two players, takes about the same amount of time and is way more dynamic and entertaining.

After one play, not all that impressed -- insufficiently fun for the high fiddle factor.  I was hoping that this game would fill the gap in my collection between two-player fillers and two-player wargames, but I'd rather take a few extra minutes and play Merchant of Venus.

This was OK, but my wife didn't like the space theme.  It also seemed like the pirates weren't much of a threat.  It also got a bit tedious going through the exploration stacks over and over.

For whatever reason I just didn't enjoy this game. I enjoyed Settlers of Catan card game(2 player) much more. It felt very "preordained". I lost one of the two games because I simply couldn't find any trade or colony planets. Bad luck right? But it still felt bleh.

Starship Catan was our first Catan game, and for a while, it was my fiance's favorite.  After we got the Catan card game, all that went out the window.  Still, it simulates the exploration aspect of space really well, has more combat than the Catan card game, and requires much more along the lines of memory skills.  The ship boards are nice, and so is the portability.

UPDATE: I've increased my rating on Starship Catan, mainly because I've really come to appreciate how well-done the theme is. Exploration games are notoriously difficult, and getting any real sense of discovery without making the game totally random is hard. But Starship Catan is one of the few games that manages to achieve it, to really give you a sense of exploring a big, unknown sector of space, but still give you enough control to be an interesting game. It's not quite as versatile and interesting as the Catan Card Game, but it's still very, very good.
---
Not quite as good as the Settlers card game IMHO, simply because you have fewer options. Still very nice, especially since it's very different from the Settlers Card Game while still retaining the same flavor.

While I still enjoyed this game, the memory element really kills any chance of me really liking the game.  In order to do well, it's essentially to remember which cards are in which stacks.  While it's probably not a game killer for most people, I really despise memory elements in games.  Although the game seems pretty slow to develop, it was still enjoyable for most of the game, but things also really seemed to drag at the end where there aren't many victory points left up for grabs.  It seems like there might be too few points available, as the game really crawled as we tried securing the very few remaining points.  Still, overall, a pretty good game that just happens to have too much of my most despised game elements.

OK for a light snack but it'll leave you feeling hungry i.e. not really overwhelming. Might be biased because I keep losing but it seems to me like a glorified memory game with spaceships and some half-hearted tactical trading strategy. Managed to convince my wife to play and even though she considered it a "boys' game", she thrashed me 10 points to 7. I obviously need to lose touch with my feminine side. If you want a Catan-ish 2 Player then you need go no further than Catan Kartenspiel in my opinion.

一隻2人絕版game 我推薦給大家 ...  Starship Catan.  若你只認為它不過是catan, 已玩Catan 無數不值一入那也許要給它一個公道,它不但有Catan 的基本神髓，精妙之處其實是其探索。對手會虛張聲勢而探險者要冒險打太空海盜,雖可計其機會選擇合適的旅程但亦要有大勇氣。我對棋不會太留情, 雖則我曾為酒醉鞭名馬而錯失一些好桌遊。但這桌遊到現在還未被我鞭走。大家行開戰棋會可望一望。不會生怕多情累美人的!

This game has a special spot in my list as one of the best two player game out there. The rule base turns a little bit of memory into a great game that can easily be finished by two players in 1:30 hours, without ever risking one player running away with the game. Probably my favorite  two-player board game out there.

Much more involved and interesting than Settlers.  But still as cut-throat and thus frustrating to the loosing player.  Once you realize you cannot make a move, there is really nothing you can do to achieve victory.  But still, more fun than the other Catan games.  

It feels like they're trying to fit too much into this game.  It is to complex for the outcome and to simple for the length.

Wonderful game with so many great features! I was thrilled to find out that you actually get to “fly” with your Starship and explore the galaxy you’re in; by drawing cards and thus creating a Flight Sequence where you can stumble upon pirates to fight, planets to colonize, stations to trade with and more. You can even take on missions and upgrade your ship with modules, boosters and guns. In my opinion, this game is even better than Settlers of Catan the Card Game!

Traded for Washington's War.

Fun game but it takes far too long for what it is.  We've never been able to play it in under 2 hours by which point we just want the game over and done.

Reimplements Starfarers of Catan for 2 players using a card mechanic.  While the mechanics are different, the feel of the original game is captured well.  The motherships are modular cardboard that the boosters and rockets attach to like puzzle pieces.  As with the original, players may still settle colonies and trade planets.  The cargo is managed well.  Instead of using chits, and individual chit is used for each of the 6 types.  The arrow is rotated to show how much of each type is available, which is less fiddly than in the original.  

It does not have the giant plastic rocket ships as randomizers of the original Starfarers.  Then again, it takes about 25 times less shelf space, plays in about 1/3 the time, costs much less, and is better for only 2 players.

RATING: 6
At first glance there is a lot of game here. Turns out it's pretty simple. The "explore space" mechanic of flipping some number of cards (based on your die roll and number of boosters you have) is kind of nifty. Oddly for a Settlers game, most of your resources don't come from production rolls, but rather from buying when the price is right. You can find places in space to buy and sell resources. It's essecially about the economics. There's a bit of a memory aspect, as there are 4 piles of cards to pick from, and the piles are basically static. So, if you remember that "cheap wheat is in pile 3", that will always be the case. But since th ecards are randomized, you won't always get it,m even if you choose to explore there. My 8 year old son loves this game right now and asks me to play almost every day. It is a bit long for a 2 player though, clocking in at 60+ minutes, even with experience.

How does this one go again?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is my favourite in the Catan series as emphasis is much more on having a good memory rather than what you throw with that stupid die. It has been compared to a race and perhaps that is precisely why I like it above all the other Catans. It is a major hassle to set up (way too much fiddly bits), the artwork of the space ships is way too complex, the subject is weird at best (not even like the other Catans at all), but game play can be excrutiatingly tense. However, the fact that not everyone has a good temporary memory means you should be careful in choosing your opponent.

[b]Update[/b] After what seems eons did this game appear on the table again, and by Random Fluctuations In The Spacetime Continuum what was I thinking when I wrote the above. The game takes far too long for what is essentially a very strongly damped growth mechanism, as there all sorts of limitations to make sure there is no runaway leader (the use of only one colonised planet, or two trade planets, for example; the use of the Logistics Centre(s) to increase cargo space; and so forth), and there being lots of stuff which serves no genuine purpose save to force the players to diversify instead of collecting VP (through either colonies or improved technologies). I'll give Klaus Teuber credit for succeeding in stopping the runaway leader, thus keeping the scores fairly close to each other as the game progresses, but on the other hand the game is now a very slow tug of war which doesn't seem to pick up a lot of pace along the way. This is not a title I expect to play again anytime soon.

Components: Lots of well-made bits, all sturdy.  The card graphics are nice.  Overall, the art greatly enhances the theme.  I dislike the rotating arrow as resource indicator, and there needs to be a better system for keeping track of victory points. Unlike with Settlers of Catan, the playing area is very cluttered with information, and difficult to quickly distill down to who is in the lead.

Experience: Managing all the resources isn't quite as fun as in Settlers, but I really enjoy exploring into the different decks and trying to remember which decks hold which cards. This exploration aspect is done better here than I've seen in any other game. Shuffling the decks and introducing new cards as old cards are replaced changes things up just enough to keep each flight interesting, but there is enough continuity that a player can begin to count on certain things (such as visiting a specific deck in order to sell a resource for profit, or visit a specific adventure world).

Competition for the Level II modules is fierce; the upgrades to allow for 4 actions and 4 resources per cargo are extremely important, much more so than the upgrades to produce trade goods or science.

The beginning is slow, as players must work very hard to scrape together enough resources for even the smallest upgrade. After about ninety minutes things are cruising along, with ships at full power, racing through the decks looking for specific things. Then everything stagnates again, because all the Level II modules have been built, as have the boosters and cannons. Resources only matter to build colony ships, or perhaps to satisfy an adventure care. Unfortunately, this means that both the beginning and end of the game feels slow and pre-determined. This game can stretch to three hours (!) for no good reason other than bad luck on everyone's part. It's good, but not that good.

Galaxy Trucker scratches my itch to build a spaceship and see what happens with it, and in only a fraction of the time. The only thing keeping this game alive for me is the exploration element.

I really like the mechanism where you fly into a space sector and encounter semi-random planets, pirates, etc. Further on, the game evolves over time, i.e., new cards are added to the sectors and new objectives are available.

Limited player interaction (you can only steal resources) but the other player is involved in your turn and has some specific tasks - hence downtime is minimized.

Takes longer than the advertised 60min - more like 2h.

90s artwork should be improved in next edition as should the resource counters, e.g., by dials.

Liked the guided introduction play where both players take turns to teach the game.

This is a great 2-player, space exploration game. The game consists primarily of managing a large set of different resources, to the best of your ability. Each player controls a starship that can be upgraded by exploring stacks of space cards that contain planets and such. Resources can be discovered, traded for, or stolen from the opponent. The design is pretty well thought out and begs for repeat plays. For players that like this type of game, I would also recommend [gameid=28143].

Given the low level of inter-player trading compared to SoC, I found this more like a "stupid dice rolling game" where the leader keeps pulling further ahead. OTOH, building up the ship and colonies and travelling through the decks is a lot of fun and the addition of little bit of memory adds nicely to the mental workout.
Good fun if a little drawn out at the end.

I like the Catan card game a little better; Starship feels similar in many ways, including the memory component and length. Every game has lasted at least 90 minutes. Although allowed, trade between players is rare in both games; in Starship, it's the only way to exchange a resource for a resource; otherwise, you're exchanging a resource for money.

Meh. While the moving parts of the game are at least mildly entertaining, I ultimately found Starship Catan to be without tension and to barely have anything in the way of interesting decisions. I didn’t even bother to finish the first game I participated in, and I can’t see ever choosing to play this over the other short, 2-player games in my collection. That being said, there is nothing actively wrong with it, and thus I rate it a 5.

The latest Settlers of Catan game is a visual treat, and a worthy addition to the Kosmos 2 player line. Players are wheeling and dealing in commodities and cash. Commodoties are used to found colonies, build trading posts, upgrade their starships and so on. A lot of the Starfarers of Catan rules and art have crossed over here, but now the exploration is done via four decks of cards that evolve as the game develops. Lots of options and decisions to be made on your turn, and different strategies to pursue. A solid 90 minute two player game, recommended.

Though I'm a diehard fan of the original multi-player SoC, I never had the urge to try the seemingly inordinate amount of SoC derivatives. I'm also not much of a space sci-fi freak, so I was a little skeptical that I'd be able to get into this game. First couple of plays were rough against a seasoned opponent, but once I got the hang of the game, I just had to get it. Now I play it with my wife all of time. I absolutely love the theme, especially the idea of exploring the "deck-galaxies". I also own the 2-player SoC, and I like this one better. The freshness of the game wears out a little bit after several plays, as some of the adventure decks are predictable. But I'm finding that it still has tremendous replay value.

It's good choice for space funs, not necessary Catan fans.

This game shares a lot of similarities to The Settlers of Catan Card Game.  Here are some of the differences:  I prefer the components of Starship as they tend to take up less space and the cards can be sleeved.  You only need to get 10 VP instead of Settlers 12 which I think translates into a quicker game which is appreciated.  I find there is more player interaction in Settlers and more of a memory element in Starship.  I prefer the theme and the player interaction of Settlers but overall I would give this game the nod due to being less fiddly, having better components, and being quicker.  Overall, there are better two player games to be played.

SOLD IT!

Interesting theming on the Catan 2 player card game where "exploring deeper in space" comes through when pushing your luck while rummaging through the deck. Adding engines and lasers to the cool ship player board is a huge plus. Some of the artwork is bit clunky.

It is a solid 2 player game and was sold since the value of the game went up, which was OK since it was feeling a bit dated.

RATING: 7
This game had so many great elements, but somehow, the actual game-play fell short.  It took us 3 hours to play through the game, and about 1 1/2 hours in, we were bored.  My game partner maxed out his spaceship eventually, and then there was nothing to do but try and collect planets.  The lack of interesting options killed the momentum.  And the final win came down to the last play.  My first-time player mistake of choosing one colony shuttle and one trade shuttle--instead of replenishing my shuttles toward the end of the game with two colony shuttles--cost me the game.  But, the winning player was not any more enthused about it.   

Everybody should try this game once because the theme rocks and the game pieces are great.  But ultimately, I don't think it will bear multiple plays.

Played 10+ times. Now that I have played this, I don't think I will ever play big-brother Starfarers of Catan ever again. This has all the good parts of Starfarers, with all the drawn-out, boring, expensive parts removed. The graphics are a little too busy, but once you are past that, the game does a great job of packing a space-exploration game into a Kosmos 2-player game. I would have liked a little more variety in the modules and in the planets (the actions on the planet cards tend to be minor variations of each other and the game is quite linear) but still fun enough.

Starship Catan is more or less a variant of the original Settlers card game, placing less emphasis on expansion and development and reducing the game to rapid resource churn in order to get to the VP goal first. The game isn't quite as long anymore as a result.

Like with the base game remembering where specific cards are in the "sector" stacks is fairly important. Those stacks slowly change over time, though, which is a nice addition. Due to the reduced variety of cards, however, it mostly comes down to hitting the same cards again and again, with a lucky or unlucky order of draws making most of the difference between the players. The game therefore quickly becomes repetitive.

Traded for it in October, 2002. Played one game. Only downside is that it runs a bit long. The first game took us nearly 3 hours! We spent maybe 30 minutes looking up rules, otherwise, it would be a  2 hour game at least. However, we both enjoyed the game. A good one that I&#039;ll NEVER play again. Just takes too long. so 10/03 I sold it.

Yet to be seriously played (12/4/10).  UPDATE: Given as a gift, and a combination of not really playing many two player anymore, and probably wanting to play other unplayed games first, has stopped it getting to the table.  But I like Starfarers of Catan, so i think when i do give this a go it will be ok. Hope to play it one day, so a rating of 5 (4/12/11). UPDATE: Finally play it - an ok game that is 90 minutes too long (it ain't a 60 minute game as advertised). Rating of 5 as unlikely to suggest and sent to archive (27/7/12).  UPDATE: Still burning a candle for this game for some reason (Rating 5.354, Sept 16).

Starship Catan was one of the earliest games I played when I was getting into board gaming.  I remember liking it, but not loving it. Now with my own copy, the feeling is still the same. It plays quite differently than any other game I have (which is pretty impressive considering it's from the Catan family). The whole 'sector exploration' part is neat. Working the optimization system as best you can is always pleasant. It can feel somewhat repetitive after awhile and the sector decks - while an interesting idea - don't offer that many surprises when you get to the end. It's not exactly a game I am eager to play again immediately after. And yet, it still is a neat game and a great way to enjoy the Catan feel with 2 players. So I'm happy to have it and play it every now and then.

I surprised myself by enjoying this game ( I'm not a big Catan fan).  The theme is very well integrated and there is enough going on for it to stay interesting throughout it's 60 minute length, and for multiple plays.  It does not have the same "I didn't roll the die properly thus freezing me out of activity" resource production problem that the original Settler's game has, yet you still roll for production.  In addition, there are new scenarios posted on-line by the designer to keep it fresh. I'm fond enough of it that I have put all the cards in sleeves. One negative: the graphics are very busy and hard to look at. Using spare cubes from other games to represent the various resources greatly improves playability.  UPDATE: It wore out.  Downgrated to a 6.

One of the best two player games that I own. Klaus Teuber really did this one right. There are some elements of competition between you and you opponent, but nothing too crippling. It is a longer game but you do not get bored as you are the narrator of your opponents journey during their turn. Even though I am not a huge Settlers of Catan fan I reccomend that anyone who has not played this game should definately try it out.

Great 2-player Game. Fairly involved and complex, but it all makes sense after the introductory game and is fairly intuitive if you're familiar with the Catan game mechanics (die rolls for resource production, victory points, how to build stuff). What really adds to the space exploration is having different sectors to explore, the adventure planets  and the increasing difficulty of pirates as the game unfolds.

This is a great 2P game, so long as you enjoy the theme.  I have greatly enjoyed several games with at least three different opponents, and each of them liked it enough to play it again later.  I see what some folks mean by lack of player interaction, but the forced "trading" module definitely requires you to pay attention to what your opponent might want.  Furthermore, the simple act of flipping the sector cards for your opponent keeps you continually involved in the game.  It goes a bit long for your first couple games, but once you get the system down, you can finish a full game in an hour.

Woe is me, sucked through a worm hole and my ship needs serious upgrading.  What can I do?  Thankfully someone else was sucked through with me and we are in a race to adapt, make friends, cash, and gather resources.  Not sure why we wouldn't team up more rather...  Oh well, best not to think about it too much.

Starfarers of Catan isn't the fastest game in the world, but it is entertaining.  Upgrading your ship (tech tree) is always nice and I always like a game with a good press your luck element to it.  If I had any complaint it would be that it is a little long.  You could always play to a smaller victory point total I guess.

Very nice artwork and production.  A lot fits in the tiny Kosmos two player box.

Finally got a chance to play this.

The 2 red flags I had about this game after reading reviews and the rules were the play length and luck factor.
I think for most games of this I'd probably want to cut it from 10VPs to 8VPs. It's a little long at 90 mins. Cutting the VP's by 20% could get this game close to an hour. 60 mins seems about right for it and wouldn't take much away,if anything at all, from the game play. 

Felt as if I could migrate any luck of the cards by choosing how to go about building my ship: Want to see more cards, than build bigger engines. Need more actions, than build the action module. Afraid of running into pirates, than build frickin lasers. Going through the space decks gave me the feeling of just how prepared am I and how much did I want to try pushing it.

SC has a good balance of racing to gather(and then spend) resources for modules, engines, & lasers first. While at the same time having enough resources on board to be able to buy and sell when the oppurtunity arose. 
There's not many good trading games for two players; but this is one of them and it isn't like any other game I have.

I enjoy the "Starfarers card game" much, much more than the Settlers Card Game, although players with a strong preference for strategic planning over tactical maneuvering may prefer the earlier game.  Some criticisms of the Settlers Card Game could also apply here.  Both are rather long games, have a somewhat solitaire-ish feel, and tax the memory heavily.  But the feel of the two games is quite different.  Starship Catan features a much greater emphasis on trade - managing the flow of cash and goods.  And it just feels more fluid, more closely fought, more thematic, and more exciting.

It's a great 2-player version of Catan.  Normal Settlers cannot be played 2-player, but this can only be played that way.  It still has a strong emphasis on trading, though it's basically all done with the bank and large reserves of money.

The flow of basic resources is much less, so trading becomes more important than just empire-building.  However, instead of the thief you run across pirates, which can be defeated for Fame, but can also blow up parts of your ship.  You can acquire VP cards by either having the most Fame or the most trade connections, or by colonizing worlds.  It works well, but the biggest detractor from the game would be the length.  Probably would speed up with repeated plays, but it is long for what it is.

A really neat space exploration and trading game for two. Each player commands a spaceship which they upgrade with weapons, engines, and other special traits. Decks of cards make up the galaxy, and you explore each looking for adventure and trading opportunities.

This game can be a lot of fun against the right player. I highly recommend the free expansion the designer offers on the website. They offer different challenges and keep the game fresh.

An interesting 2-player game, where one needs to explore sections of the galaxy (4 hidden decks of 10 cards), pick up and deliver goods (your choice, no "orders" cards) in order to generate a profit, which you can then use to upgrade your ship's stores, weapons, propulsion, etc.

There is little interaction between players, other then "seeing" the cards your opponent turns over, and the odd resource trade/theft now and again.

A good filler, if a tad long.

Result:
We tried very hard to like this game but it was too fidgety, too difficult to catch up from behind and just quite frankly too slow and boring.    Since it is out of print and reasonably valuable, gonna sell or trade it away.

Sold it to a MSFT employee for 40$.

Interesting little exploration/economic game that packs a lot of game play in a small box. Repeated plays have shown this is a good game that plays a bit too long. We play to 8 Victory rather than 10.

Oddly enough, while this game has several features present in Ad Astra, Race for the Galaxy, and Galaxy Trucker, I don't like it nearly as well as those other, admittedly more recent, games.

Absolutely brilliant design. Most immersive SF-themed game for 2 players that plays within an hour. Love the retro Buck Rogers graphics. Love exploring the unknown, via selection of the 4 random decks, trying to remember what decks have the cheap resources, and which decks have will buy them back at a higher price, through a non-linear "pick up and deliver" mechanic. Pirates and adventures abound in each deck, making for a truly exciting adventure. Player interaction can be high, and possibly game-breaking with the trade modules, but interesting nevertheless. The race to 10 VP is not unlike the original Settlers, and the asymmetric starting conditions makes for an interesting game every time. Simply love this design!

Update (11/13/09): After several plays, it seems that whoever is able to strike the food/ore/carbon planets first is going to do better, as they will be able to grab the level II ship subsystems. From that perspective, it seems extremely random, which is making me drop this from a '10' back down to a '9'. Would be interesting if this card-stack exploration mechanic could be expanded to 3 or 4 players.

Update (07/12/12) 9 plays: It doesn't get much play because it is rare when there are just two players, but it is still highly regarded. The tactile feel of the game is unmatched, from the turning of the crude cardboard dials for resource tracking, to the card shuffling/dealing to simulate space exploration, to the building up your starship with puzzle-like pieces. It makes me feel like a kid again, like a toddler playing with a Playskool activity center.

1 play, will play again.  Not bad, long for what it is though.  For the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the game I was into it, the exploration, the ship building, the pirate fighting...then the game did not end, it kept going.  Our game took about 2 hours to play.  I know, traditionally, the first game of any game takes longer, but there was little in the way of rule hunting, no going back to fix mistakes...  I am not sure how this would speed up.  Also, I have read previous comments about the lack of interaction between players so I was quite aware of this fact, but once my opponent started to take a lead, there was nothing I could do to slow him down.  That bugged me.  The last third of the game was just waiting for it to end.  When I play again, there are some things that I will do differently.  This would make the game closer, it also seems that would make the game last longer.

I have played different Catan type games and they all have the same feeling to them and it is something that I am finding that I do not get too excited about.

Anyways, I really want to like this game so I will give it another shot.

Fun translation of the resource gathering of Catan, while attempting to mitigate the frustration of the dice.  You still produce using dice, but you have an opportunity to buy/sell materials as you fly in your chosen sector of space, giving you some control over your luck.  The game is very long for a two player game, and starts kind of slow, but once it's going it's exciting.  Very little direct player conflict, probably less than even Catan and the robber.

Really neat little game here Klaus came up with, very thematic actually and even fun.  

Players each have a ship, that they spend time upgrading and outfitting with different things like cannons and thrusters etc to help them in their journeys.  The core of the game is exploring different galaxies, which means searching through different card decks looking for cheap resources to buy, planets that buy resources for high prices, and planets players can colonize or set up as trade posts.  Money is key in the game, and buying low and selling high is one of the most important things you are doing here.  Due to the unknown aspect in exploration, there is a pretty big luck factor in which cards you will encounter, especially at the beginning.  Cards are open info, so after some time you start to know what is in each pile, and the luck is somewhat lessened since you know where you are going hunting and for what (does NOT mean you will find it though, and memory is key here).  You also roll a die to determine production much like regular Catan, only here the die has only 1,2 and 3.  In the beginning again luck plays a fair size role with the die roll, later on if effect things much less since players will typical set themselves up with some of each number (1,2,3).  Overall I find the luck factor to be a little too high here for about a 1 hour game, I’m not sure if it will stop me from playing or not yet but I do think luck will decide a game between near equal players for sure.  

The game needs some expansions for sure for replay sake, which I think it got 2 of them, not sure what they are (could be just pdf’s) but there are not that many cards especially mission cards and the modules are limited as well, with 2 of them being way stronger than the other’s making things a little scripted in the beginning.  This could have been a 7 or 7.5 for me, but the luck is significant enough to hamper my enjoyment just a little and the other things I mention also detract from its score.  

=> traded

Not a ton of interaction here unless you start with the Trade Module.  Also runs a little long.  Doesn't have a lot that is reminiscent of Catan.  I think it can stand on its own two feet without the Catan moniker.

This game is everything I used to love about Settlers of Catan without the annoying variances in production, and with the confrontation (and accompanying bad feelings) much blunted.  There are many and varied ways to spend resources and distinguish your own starship from the opponent's, and an ingenious little exploration mechanic where you can keep encountering the same worlds but can't be quite sure where they are.  (I'm not sure how thematic that is - what, we aren't recording star positions?  But it's OK.)

I'm not sure how much replayability Starship Catan has for me yet but I was enchanted with my first play.  I have a feeling it will fall to an 8, but a solid 8.  A game I may well purchase at some point.

I think the abstraction of the exploration elements by the card decks as opposed to a map is rather clever.

Starship Catan is sometimes criticized for being long and repetitive, but for me it was a relief to play a game that allowed for real development and exploration. The two of you are lost out in space in an unknown galaxy, and the goal is to establish yourself among the native planets, improve your ship so that it can meet any threat or challenge, and perhaps find a way home. The galaxy is divided into four regions represented by facedown stacks of cards. You roll a die (values 1-3, not 1-6), add your engine power, and then explore that number of cards (up to a maximum of 10). A card could be a trading station, a planet that needs your help in some form or another, a space pirate, or even a potential colony. Early in the game, you get a sense of where all the opportunities are to buy and sell various resources, but each region of space is never quite known to you because new cards are slowly added to the game. Your options are several: better scientific research, command computers, sensors, weapons, engines, and so on. Everything can be upgraded twice, and the second set of upgrades are worth points and can only be built by one player, causing your capabilities to diverge in the second half of the game.

If there's a problem with Starship Catan, it's that the interaction between players all comes down to who gets what first. Let's say the planet Hades is having problems with space pirate raids. One player may get a point for finding and defending it first. Or lets say you discover a potential colony in a region. You want to colonize before they can. There's a very minor ability to trade steal goods from one another, but even so, I can't shake the feeling that the game needs another point / method of player interaction. The exploration and development are top notch. Certainly a winner for the non-confrontational among us.

Update: first play with the SO was a huge success, and I can appreciate the racing aspect of the interaction a bit more. I also see that the trading feature might be enough to prod your opponent. 

Update 2: 4 plays and still getting better. I think this might actually be a 9. It's interesting to think about how this game would be different if it were released today - I would bet money it would include more cards in order to achieve the "subset variability" that is so common lately. 

Update 3: In 9 plays I've had one misfire. I'm not really sure what went "wrong" either, but I lost 10-6 with the diplomacy deck stalled in the 2s and the reserve deck in the green. All modules were bought early after the first three turns revealed the locations of each 1-cost trading station. 2/3 of the goods for modules were in one stack. Maybe that unbalanced the game in favor of the first player? I don't know. I felt like I had great moves all the way to defeat. 

Update 4 (3-9-10): This is a once every month / every other month type of game. My one concern is the unequal turns thing; I think I will play equal turns from now on. 

Update 5 (12-23-10): Equal turns is a no-brainer, but Starship Catan still hits a pretty hard replayability ceiling. I'm enjoyed my ~15 plays quite a bit, and the game has a lengthy and satisfying development arc, but the more I play the less willing I am to overlook the repetitiveness of the Galactic Council deck. This is such an obvious place for subset-based replayability - it drives me nuts. All three of the official, freely distributed PnP expansions for this game are totally phoned in, too, which is a shame. The game also needs fine tuning so that the red tier of the reserve deck is consistently a factor in play, and some cards (Median) need to be scrapped altogether and redesigned. Lastly, the Friend of the People VP is weak and suffers deserved neglect among experienced players. Attaining it ought to provide a special power (e.g. -1 to all future purchases) to compensate. 

Starship Catan is a special game, but the more I play it the more it shows its age.

RATING: 6.5
The game offers interesting decisions as you develop your race and attempt to make beneficial trades, buying low and selling high.  The weakness is that it's "too long for what it is" and so gets tedious.  Plus, it requires some memory, which isn't to everyone's taste.

After reading the rules I was really stoked about playing. Flying through space, building up your spaceship, buying and selling, encoutering pirates sounded like Merchant of Venus - Catan style. After playing I was disappointed. 
Although the rule book itself already cautions that the initial play might take two hours and playtime should go down to one hour with more experience, this is just too long for the limited game system on offer here. The game turns became repetitious which might be in part to us failing in the memory part and doing more pointless moves than necessary. The production phase is a meagre mirror image of Catan, the trading between players never happened. The buildup of the spaceship never felt decisive and distinctive enough.
I can't imagine that there's enough to discover on future outings to warrant the time needed and there's just so many better alternatives around in the mean time fighting for this rare two-player spot.

3 July 09  Really enjoying this game.  My friend and I are currently playing through our first game.  We've had two 1 and a half hour sessions so far and my friend has to get 3 more Victory Points (VPs) to win the game, I need 4.  So that's 3 hours and still going but we're not complaining as we're enjoying it so much.  There are so many things to do.  VPs come primarily through founding colonies at planets but there are only 10 colony planets in the game, so you have to find VPs elsewhere.  This is done by completing missions at Adventure planets, building level 2 modules on your ship, being the player with the most trading posts and/or pirates defeated.  Lots of fun. Rating will likely go up with repeated plays.

29 Aug 13 - Rating has gone down (from 8 to 6) with repeated plays. A little long for what it is but still get it out occasionally.

RATING: 5
A fun game that does a good job of distilling the essence of Starfarers down to the essentials while retaining part of the Settlers Card Game flavor as well, yet still feeling like a unique game.  My only gripe with this one is that it can potentially drag out a little too long.  With further play I'm sure that it will become quicker, and perhaps rise in rating.

Fantastic game. There's a healthy dose of luck involved in the card drawing, but I love the way the game captures the feel of space exploration. The components are brilliantly done and add greatly to the theme. All in all, my new favourite 2-player game.

RATING: 8
Very good play for 2-persons. I like that plane development part and space travelling  trough that deck. It helps if you have good memory and remember cards in deck, but if you develop plane so that you can lookup deck before then it helps also. I have poor "deck" memory so i like to use that development way.

I absolutely LOVE this game.  The more I play the better it gets.  2 players each deciding how they wish to advance themselves.  Different strategies prove effective at different times.  Die rolls seem far less frustrating than in other settlers games, theme is awesome, fun factor way up there.  But can't seem to get the games in in under 90 minutes.  Maybe will change.  I LOVE this game, I just wish it played a little faster (meaning finished a little earlier, it doesn't have much downtime)

RATING: 9
Currently my favorite 2 player game. The production value is great and it plays really well with 2 players. My only caveat is this. We've changed the starting values for the Blue and Red sides so that their initial colony produces fuel (instead of blue producing carbon). After playing a few times I noticed that I either lost or had a very hard time getting going in the game when playing as blue. Getting carbon (which is only used to make cannons and upgrade parts in the ship) doesn't enable the player to build more ships with which he colonizes more planets, thus getting more resources. We've had a LOT more fun after changing this and I highly recommend doing so!

Ez egy nagyon szuper játék. Engem kimondottan meglepett, szinte minden tetszik benne, talán csak egy picit a játékidőt lehetne kritizálni, de gyakorlatilag az összes Catan kicsit hosszabb, mint az ideális lenne. Remek ötletek vannak benne, kb csak a dizájn miatt lehet érezni, hogy nem mai darab, mechanikailag frissnek érzem. Ráadásul nagyon tematikus. Kár az enyhe nyelvfüggésért, attól tartok, a német nyelv és a furcsa rajzok az okai annak, hogy ez nem olyan népszerű darab.

This is a pretty fun "catan" game, I like the space aspect of everything. However, you need to request the free adapters to the rocket ships, otherwise you won't be able to attach any of the expansion (cause the plastic that holds them have broken off of all the ships). Aside from the fragility of the ships themselves, it's a fun mix up when feeling Catan-ish. If it were cheaper, I would suggest it... but at the price ... I'd say take it or leave it.

I love this game in small doses. We've had to amend the winning point to 8 since the last two points to get to 10 can sometimes take WAY too long.

Well, I have to say that this was probably my first 'favorite' game, and I still love it.

A very nice two players game dripping with theme while implementing interesting mechanics and light resource management.

I love 2-player games, but it is not often you'll find one that lasts more than 30 minutes. This does! 
You have your own starship and you'll explore the univers (4 decks of cards) to look for colonies, planets, trading deals, and spacepirates(!), while you're upgrating you spaceship. 
Unfortunately, after playing it only 2 time, it feels like you're playing Solitaire. 
I like the theme and the fact that it can entertaine 2 people for about 1 hour.
Update: originaly rated a "7", but after playing it 2 times, it can only be a "6".

So far my favourite 2 player game. Great to have such a 'meaty' (for non-war) game for two. Direct player interaction is actually minimal (and a game may take two hours) but it's a constant race to get parts to your spaceship, and to get the good cards first, so it's quite tense. This game puts me in a very competitive mode :o). Most fun to play with opponent of equal 'memory capacity'. Space theme works great, good design.

User SeanXor said in his blog "Mechanically, I like this game. It offers a decent two player game that combines elements of resource management, building, and exploration. However, the game is boring to play. Too much of the game is doing the same thing, with far too few actions being terribly meaningful. The game goes on for too long consistently. It passes the point of being fun and begins to be a bit boring near the end."

This mirrors my own view so well, I just copied his comments here.

Though it definitely tilts the luck gauge a bit (actually slams it against the wall) and takes away some of the advantage of boosters and/or the module that lets you peek at the pile, we will occasionally play with a single 40-card pile rather than four 10-card piles... or other similar variants.

RATING: 6.8
I like space oriented games, I like the catan card game. This was an easy choice. You train your memory skills and if you can identify with the theme it's like exploring space yourself. I like it more than the catan base card game, but I don't play it very often: my friends are not really into a space theme.

Edit: adjusted the rating, the game just tends to get less and less played. Mostly due to me. If I get the opportunity to play it, I tend to choose another game (like the Catan Card Game, Agricola ACBAS, etc.). I don't really know why: maybe the memory aspect...? I need to explore that feeling further...

Lovely theme and bits. I suppose it was a must own for a sci-fi geek. Very nice race/exploration game with solid mechanics. The person who plays to their maximum advantage will win. However, there is little to no interaction, which sometimes we are just in the mood for, and it can run a bit long. It will take you some time to understand the setup, rules, etc.

Very good 2-player adaptation to Starfarers. Indeed, it's even better then the game it's based on.

60 minutes my butt--you're looking at two hours for this.  The game is reasonably fun, but it's WAY too long for what it is.  If it played in 45 minutes I think it would be a regular in my rotation.  At two hours, it's competing for tabletime with Twilight Struggle.  It's likely to be a casualty the next time I purge my collection.

RATING: 7
A fun 2 player game which brings some of the mechanics of settlers into the space theme. Track your resources on the players ship cargo holds themselves instead of with cards. Also the ability to upgrade the guns and boosters are a nice bonus as well the ability to "capture" a planet to be used for trading.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Well-made game, balanced and good mechanics.  Only complaint is there's not much drama in it- very little sense of adventure, no exciting moments.  Exploring the different sectors and doing the adventures is interesting - ties in the theme well.  But very little in the way of surprises and colony/trade planets aren't very interesting.  Very little direct interaction with other player.  Basically simultaneous solitaire, race to see who finishes first.

09/03/16 Played a game, in 2.8 hours! I assume it'll take less time in future now that I know what I'm doing.  Some complain there is almost no player interaction. I agree its limited, but there is enough to keep me happy.  The game does have a memory element. Though I didn't find it that overbearing. I was amazed at the amount of stuff they packed in that standard small Kosmos two-player game box. You really get you money's worth! 
06/24/17 Played a second game in 2.9 hours. I still can't figure out why this game takes so darn long, when the box say one hour! My best guess is, resource collection is slowed significantly due to the inability of players to trade with the bank. I've played a *lot* of other Catan games and this is an important aspect when there are certain resources you may not be producing.  Every other Catan game I've played allows for either 3:1 or 4:1 trading with the bank.

I haven't played Settlers in years and probably never will again, but this engaging little card game is a keeper.

It's a completely different kind of game where you get to explore sectors of space for yes resources but also to overcome obstacles so you can get back home again.

RATING: 8
Great mid-length two-player game. Takes a while to set up and put away, and the game itself requires probably about an hour to play.

In my experience, there's not much trading between players, except using the trading module. This makes the game not feel as interactive as Settlers (or Starfarers) of Catan. On the other hand, you do need to keep watching what the other player is doing, keeping an eye out for important planets. There is also some potential to screw the other player over, or be screwed - it's not a vicious game, but is about as confrontational as Setters.

My daughter and I played an epic 2 hour game of this, and it came down to the last draw. She won. I can see this game getting more fun with time. It takes a little too long to play, however, and relies too heavily on memorization. And ultimately, it comes down to "buy for 2, sell for 3, rinse, and repeat, until you have enough resources to buy everything you need".

I first played this at a game group event.  The host and I were the only ones there for a while and he whipped out his copy.  This is the best two player game I have played so far.  There is room for strategy and the game isn't over in 15 minutes.  You have to play it out.  I like it a lot.

I still haven't gotten around to finishing a game and I have a hard time asking others to play it with me when there are so many better games out there that aren't as ugly and hard to learn.  UPDATE (5 years later...)  I had fun playing this.  It uses the Catan resource creation mechanic (die roll) but other than that it's quite a different game.  Light and enjoyable with exploration and technology upgrades.

Moon and Sun don't seem evenly strong ...

After about 3 years I finally played Starship Catan again. It struck me (again) that
- SC is a loooooooooooooong journey. How on earth (?) can the playing time be 60 mins? We hardly manage a game in 120 mins.
- SC is hard work. Keeping track of everything asks a lot of players.
- Moreover the memory aspect is more than I like, especially for such a long game.

Yet it is a pleasant game for the right occasion.

Another good two player card game. Again, it's pretty much a memory game with a little luck of the dice thrown in, but I still enjoy the theme. Perhaps suffers from being slightly over-long, as well as having the same "hard to catch the leader" problem that the Settlers CG suffers from.

The theme is strong in this one. Upgrading your ship. fighting space pirates, completing missions. Interaction with the other player after reading the rules seems to be low, but that is not the case: you are constantly trying to snatch victory points away from your opponent. Feels like a tense race.

Reason for selling it: was too much in between two of my favourites, the SoC Card game and RftG, so it seldom got played.

Probably my favorite game to teach new players because of all the cool pieces.  Each player gets there own spaceship to build that also doubles as a shaker which determines their ship's speed.  It's hard to find this game anymore so I'm grateful to have received a copy as a gift from my wife.

The only reason my rating isn't higher is that I've only played two games...and lost both, so I haven't found a way to win yet.  Both my opponents seemed to get a gajillion colonies/trade outposts and just out-produced me.  That said, I really really like this game, more than the Settlers Card Game (with or without expansions.)  It's fun, exciting, and interactive (especially with flying through stacks) and very little "screw-you" factor.  However, if you don't fly into the right stack at the right time and accumulate resources, it can be frustrating, as there are all those beautiful decisions you can't make!  However, it was STILL very fun, and resources are always scarce until just before the end.  I can't wait to teach my wife!

Yet another game in the Catan franchise but one of the best ones for my money. Unlike the card game this throws up some truly new mechanics and the ability to explore 1 of 4 galaxies with each turn fits the theme beautifully. It can outstay its welcome when first learning, but once both players know their options it can be played in 60-70 minutes. The game play on offer here is well worth that investment.

RATING: 7
Somewhat tedious and sleepy - but still a good game. The Settlers of Catan Card Game is better.

Febuary 24th, 2007:
Lowered from 7 to 6. There's little variety - unlike in the Settlers of Catan Card Game, there aren't really any buildings you can build that allow you to get special powers - you're really just trying to upgrade your modules, and you always have the same choice of modules every time - the only difference being only one copy of each level two module. Too long for what it is, it needs to be distilled into a 20-minute filler.

July 21st, 2007:
Raised from 6 back up to 7. It's not as good as the Settlers of Catan card game, but it's still a good game, which plays quickly when you know what you're doing.

A good logistical game that presents many challenges and aspects and decisions. A bit dry to play, as the game's presentation is straightforward rather than humorous or fun, but game play moves along at a decent pace. Also, as others note, this may take twice the listed one-hour time to play, so that may become tedious for some (having 2 actions per turn at most feels too restrictive and definitely slows down play significantly. In my first game, I played 27 rounds before getting a winner.) Still, there seems to be an unquestionable challenge to be the first one to work out all the logistics to find their way back to their own galaxy, which is the object. Personally, from playing I got more a sense of an economic rather than exploration/adventure/battle game--which was what I had been looking for. That is, the actual game play revolves more around buying or selling things in order to obtain colonies or establish trading posts in order to achieve the ultimate goal of gaining enough victory points to return to one's galaxy. Perhaps a standard game board with possible destinations rather than cardboard ships would have given more of a sense of traveling through space. In all, it's a well designed game, but not my bag. What struck me when I finished my first (long) game was a feeling of "Phew, that's finally done!" rather than, "That was fun, let's play again." So, my "5" rating reflects my opinion that I could take or leave this game. Consequently, I sold my copy.

Note: Allow 20-30 minutes for initial set-up.

This game also took a lot of work to learn: I found the "Professor Easy pamphlet" (that comes with the game) to be next to worthless, because it tells you what to do, but doesn't explain why, or put directions into context, and lacks enough illustrations to make game play clear. So, I give Professor Easy an "F". Also, the regular rulebook comes up short, not for what is explained, but for what is left unaddressed in the rules. So, this is one I would have preferred to have learned from an experienced player. However, I eventually did figure it out (with some help from BGG Q & A, and one member).

We use some house rules to speed up the game ... 2 production dice ... start each player with one of each resource and 35 astros. This sounds like a lot of extra kick, but a game still takes a little over an hour, if you play to 10 victory points. Quite different from Settler&#039;s of Catan card game than some give it credit for. Personally, I like it very much. I like tinkering with the little bits and pieces, which are of very high quality.

One of my three or four favorite purpose-built 2p card games. Dearly deserves an expansion but it's never gonna happen.

Each player gets a little ship map that slowly fills with "modules" (cards) and goods that get sold off to buy more modules, shuttle craft, guns and engines. Engines allow you to dig deeper into one of the four "galactic directions" decks that are filled with planets, and gives you a better selection of places to trade with or colonize.

I'd play this more if it weren't for the fact there are so many really great games available that scratch a similar itch: Eminent Domain, Race for the Galaxy and so on.

Got it today:D (19/07/2007) was a gift out of nowhere from a Danish guy around here (I better not say his name, otherwise people go and ask him for free games). that was one geeky dude!! Thanks pal. It is a much better game then catan card game, players try to remember in which galaxy the best deals can be made, sell expensive - buy cheap then build. And the modules are a good idea and well implemented. One of the best 2-player games in my collection.

Unfortunately I had to part of my copy due to some ill-fated happening... hopefully I'll get my hands on a new copy soon. Kosmos 2-player seireis' finest game.

Got a replacement copy in English! Hooray! Love this game and can't wait to smack it on the table!

With Dracula the best game in the Kosmos 2-player games series. Love this game. This is a perfect example of a conversion well done. It's completely different from its source material, yet you can see how the designer got there. Absolutely stunning game, it's even better than the 4-player game it spun off.

A good complement to the Catan card game, but with a richer theme

Nov 13
When I first played this it was round a friends house, having played more recently it went very long using the rules as written. We played again since and used the traditional Catan rules of everything produces on a matching dice roll which made it better but still dropping it from a previously inflated 8

RATING: 7
This two player game offers a nice mix of different mechanics. You have to trade resources to build stuff and make money, which requires some memorizing (where you can find cheap resources). The upgrading of your spaceship offers some strategy. Encountering pirates adds some excitement and the dice and cards (especially the council cards) add some luck. An ok game, but the amount of luck and the length of the game are not really balanced in my opinion (the game could do with a little less luck).

A great 2-player game if you don't mind space themes.  My only beef is that it seems to drag a little to get the last couple of victory points.  I think it would work better to play to 7 or 8 VP.  There just aren't enough colonies in the deck for it not to drag towards the end.  I can't wait to try some of the print-and-play expansions!

Who can play?  Strategy game for 2 players.

This game is a race to explore space.  Resources are abundant, but the player who uses each turn to maximum effectiveness and remembers which planets are in which sectors in space will win.  This is the best race game I've seen and one of the best two-player games.

Entertaining two-player Settlers-like adventure.  It has its share of clunky mechanics (I've NEVER traded with my opponent) and the modules' powers are way too imbalanced (the Sensor is just too useful not to choose at the start of the game) but nonetheless, it has the feel of a Settlers game.

This is a good game.  I have mixed feelings.  I kind of like it (somewhat feel of Settlers), but kind of don't (maybe the memory part).  I think it takes a little more time than you'd expect for a 2-player game.

I liked this a lot less than I thought I would.  Sure, it has a touch of the familiar with the dice rolls to get resources, but my son and I felt like it was strongly solitaire-y.  Interaction between players is more mechanical than organic.  The theme feels somewhat forced, despite the high production value.  It certainly looks beautiful on the table, but would have been more entertaining as a two player co-op.  However, I'm sure we're spoiled by 2P Galaxy Trucker which, although also not co-op, is far more exciting.  Starship Catan: Above average at best.

Apparently, I'm too easy to please. But 9 it is!

In any case, the Prof. Easy walkthrough tutorial is a fantastic alternative to slogging through the whole rulebook. Set it up, follow the steps in the tutorial, and after 4 prescripted turns, you've got it. It's a great way to learn the game and a great way to teach others the game without their eyes glazing over as you try to explain the rules.

Not quite as much strategy and fierce competition as the Catan Card Game. This game requires you to keep track of resource costs so you can buy low and sell high and keep your cash (er "astro") flow on the up.

My wife and I enjoy this game as it is specifically made for 2 players.  Its a good game but not a great one.  

First, there is a good bit of luck involved - lots of die rolling for production and flipping cards to see what comes up.  I don't mind this so much, but many people I know do dislike that amount of randomness.  I also think there is an advantage to starting with the "carbon world" versus the "fuel world".  Carbon is essential to both guns and modules and you need both if you plan to win this game.  Yes, fuel is important for other things, but I would choose carbon over fuel any day - I would have preferred if both players started with a resource world of the same type.

That being said, I enjoy space themed games and this one is nice if you often have a small base of players.  It doesn't drag on too long for what it is, so on the whole I'd give it slightly under a seven.

Not as good as the original Catan card game (or most of its expansions) according to my wife, but I think it holds its own.  It offers a really neat variant around the space theme very well.  The exploration of space and battles are very cleverly done.  If not for those and the pretty bits I would rate this lower.  I just love dealing out the space cards my opponent will fly through and then watching them get nailed by pirate ships...  If you like the space theme then get this now!  If not then you may want to hold back unless you are looking for cleverly different play mechanics for a 2 player game.

Interesting take on Starfarers - and a fun game.  Exploration is interesting and the development tree leaves some meaningful decisions in this two player game.  Play time is a little long, but honestly, it's never bothered me when playing.  Always a good sign!  Fun.

Nice Catan 2-player game. we found it better balanced than the regular card game. Among other things, the fact that you almost necesssarily always get resources (there are 3 possibilities rather than 6) and that if you have many production centres producing you have to choose one to actually produce, then it becomes more of a strategy game. The luck factor only plays with the cards you are able to find in your exploration, but you can minimize the risk by building more/better reactors.

Very low dependant on luck, so with a reasonable smart opponent, you're in for a game of chess.

A great distillation of Starfarer. Combines the typical Settlers formula with an exploration and memory element. For a Kosmos 2 player game, along with Hellas, this one packs a lot of bang for the buck. Much like the standard Settlers of Catan card game, this one takes up a premium amount of table space. Perfect way to get your Settlers fix without 4 people.

Some nice ideas in the mechanics department and a bit more complex than your regular Kosmos 2-player. Sadly playing Starship is boring and takes too long for what you get out from it. I should get rid of this, but I have a little soft spot for the Kosmos 2-player series.

It is an interesting game but always seems to take a while to get going and regularly goes over the 60 minutes it says on the box.  Gets an outing once in a while, but doesn't get regular play in our house at least.

RATING: 7
Ingenious mechanism for exploration and market trading.  Quite fun.  Of all the games in the Settlers franchise, Starship is the most different--it's much more important to get good trading deals than to produce raw materials--but the spirit of Catan is still there.  Too bad it doesn't play a bit faster.

Apparently, the game is supposed to play in 45 minutes.  However, I finished my first game in three hours!  I liked it, but I think the victory point requirement might be too steep, especially for a FIRST game.  The stealing, I mean trading option, was also a bit annoying.  The pirates were kind of painless, and the fame points also appeared kind of worthless.

I can see why people like this game, but It just didn't do it for me.  First of all the colors and patterns on the board (ship) were so garish that I didn't even want to look to see what I was doing for fear of a headache.  I like the card space exploration bit but it would be better if that element was a bit more intereactive, because of the pirates the card drawing is slow.  I wish the game was more than playing a solitare hand with your opponent stealing resources now and again.  Lots of annoying fiddling and micromanaging.  Bad luck with draws can lead to irritating hand when all planets can only earn with a one, and then you must chose only one resource.  Tough to catch up.  Great looking cards though.

Great 2p game.  Like other Catan games, there is a production roll, building, and action taken.  The trading element is changed such that you have to build a trading module on your ship, and you can force your opponent to sell you a resource (no resources are hidden).  There is also generation of income to purchase resources.  Some are turned off by the memory aspect of the exploration phase, but I have a horrible memory and still do very well.  It takes about 1.5h to play, which is [i]almost[/i] too long, but there's enough game here to justify the play time.

Played once. It was enjoyable for me, but I got off to a better start than my wife did. After the halfway point in the game, it seemed a foregone conclusion that I would win (being ahead in VPs), and resources didn't seem much of a limitation anymore. Also the Pirates seemed too easy. (Maybe declare that ties are losses.)

Played once and didn&#039;t finish, but made me want more!  I&#039;m amazed that Klaus Teuber continually comes up with such innovative games that retain the feel of Settlers yet also stand alone as unique.  You can probably count on one hand the number of really good movie sequels.  The rulebook looks a bit imposing.  However, once you start playing the mechanics are pretty straightforward.  It does play as basically two-player solitaire, but I never mind that since whenever you play a game with someone you&#039;re still interacting with that person and having fun!

RATING: 7
This is a two-player version of the very popular Starfarers of Catan which I have not played so I cannot compare it to that.

The only connections to the Settlers of Catan (or Catan as it is now simply called) are tangential to two of the mechanics.  The first is that you can collect worlds that will generate goods for you based on a die roll and the other is that collecting a certain number of trade colonies or defeating a certain number of pirates gets you a bonus victory point similar to the largest road and army points in Catan.

Past that though it feels like a very different game and a pretty good two-player experience at that.  Players in this game each have a starship.  This starship is made up of engines, weapons, 6 different resources, 6 different pieces of equipment that translate to special powers, and up to two total of trade or colony ships.  At the start of each player's turn they will roll a die determining how far they can explore and draw that many cards from one of four decks.  The cards are a wide array of things from pirates you fight to planets you can settle, to simply trade vessels you can buy and sell goods on.

This goes back and forth until one player reaches a certain number of points.  There are two minor quibbles I have with this game.  The first is there isn't a balancing mechanism for the second player and since the game is ostensibly a race I think there needs to be.  The second is that it is lacking a bit of tension and competition.  There are no catch-up mechanisms so one player getting ahead can end up feeling like you are just playing out a foregone conclusion.  There was still enough here that I enjoyed it and our game was close, I can just see that if games are not close this might be an issue.

Catan's two-player variant in space. Sweet, especially when Catan was so big for me it was nice to have the option to play with only two yet I never quite liked it as much as the settlement original. I think it always took too long to get going and then in the end phase things happen too quickly, some might complain the same over the original but since the O-game had more interaction it never bothered me the way it did here. And between you and me, there are other tow-player games I prefer. Nevertheless, this one has a cool theme with nice bits, it is fun to play.

While not as versatile as the Settlers card game, this sure is very good game for two players. Unlike the Settlers card game, trading between players sometimes happen, as resources are far harder to get. The memory element becomes more important, but that does not bother me at all. It can run a bit long (up to an hour), but it's always entertaining.

[Mayfair Games 2001 edition] {Space exploration; development, dice rolling, drafting, resources management} My favorite 2p game - an interesting space exploration game. The space exploration theme is just alive in this game :) The game bits are so pretty and sturdy and the outlook of the spaceships is fantastic. Its nature of development and exploration makes it a good game in a collection.

The game is full of fun, though it supports only 2 players. There is little confrontation and interaction in this game - interaction appears only in the trading module between players and competition in establishing colonies and trading planet or rushing for adventure planets. As a 2p game, it's quite long, typically runs around 60-90 minutes.

The rules are clearly illustrated in the rule and guide book. However, it's easy to overlook some rules. It needs 1 to 2 games to learn all the rules. Cheat sheet can be used to avoid the memory factor :)  Besides, I prefer the variant that a new card is placed face down when replacing a used card. It makes the game more true to its exploration theme.  It is well-balanced. There are no over-power cards or modules. This game involves a mild degree of luck with the card draw and dice roll but it's well controlled. I don't mind this luck as it fits the theme of exploration well.

I think this game has a whole lot of great things going on: the resource/build mechanic of other Catan games, a nice memory element, and a dash of dice-driven combat and drama. It's also a great mix of game mechanics and theme, and seemingly several paths to victory. Likely to accrue more plays in the coming months.

Update: downgraded to a 6. This is missing out on table time due to long setup and play time, which is just too much for a casual 2 player game.

After having played the large boardgame version of this, I thought I might enjoy this cheaper, condensed incarnation. However, it boils down to a boring race of buying upgrades for your spaceship, with the interaction between the players being even lower than in the Settlers of Catan Card Game. Chances to catch up with a runaway player are meager, so you have to sit through a miserable time losing, and the games tend to be too long. On the positive side however, the game's exploration component as represented by the different card stacks is a clever and intriguing mechanic.

Game is well designed, meshes well, component quality ok. Our first game was a bit of a learning experience (my wife burning through money, myself very slow in picking up trading posts/colonies). Because of that, gametime expanded enormously.

However, I can see past those issues as as soon if we get more experienced both our choices, our play speed and hence gametime will be better.

There is one more issue though: there is not enough interaction. Basically the only interaction is the possibility to once in a while steal other person's resources. Oh yeah, and there's trade which is never done as it is basically a zero-sum game.

Because of the lack of interaction, the fun needs to come from discovering the game engine. We don't have that down yet, so we might get some extra plays out of it, but once that is done I fear it will become a tedious slugfest of repetitive moves.

Have not seen full game yet, so rating is very provisional. Probably will get a bit better next few plays, only to go down hard after we've mastered it.

Still, not a bad game and better as the Settlers of Catan card game. So if you like that and want some variety, it doesn't hurt to pick this up as well.

First play : Very enjoyable Saturday afternoon couples game. I got schooled by Jessica who figured out the game a few turns before me.

On our second play we both matched point for point which led to a drag out of the game. I plowed through a deck looking for a colony to found before things got really out of hand. I still enjoy it but will look for ways to shorten it, possibly with the expansion.

For it's uniqueness and gameplay I would give it an 8, but the pacing makes it a 6.  So - a 7.

Also expansion :

I feel like I'm the only person on the planet with this game.  Despite its name and the mechanic of rolling a die to determine resources, this plays nothing like Settlers of Catan at all.

There are some pretty obvious optimal plays though and it goes on a little longer than I think it should.

This is a fascinating little game.  It can take a while for what it is, but I find it quite fun.  The "Professor Easy" booklet included with the game actually makes it quite simple for new players to be introduced to the game, which means that I can teach others how to play quite readily (if only the Settlers Card Game came with such a booklet, as explaining that one sometimes is a chore).  One thing that new players don't often understand - money is tremendously important in this one.  If you don't have it, you're going to have trouble.  Money management is as, or more, important than resource managment, as resources will keep coming.  One quibble - players often forget that when the die is rolled and it matches multiple planets, only one colony can produce (this is different from both Settlers and the Settlers card game).

A fun two player game with a nice theme. It has some things in common with Settlers, but it's different enough to provide some variety. The graphics are very nice and the compononents top notch quality (the 999games edition that is).
The game starts rather slowly (you're just gathering resources to finally upgrade your spaceship) and in the end it goes rather quickly. The player with the Moon-shield in the beginning of the game seems to have the advantage of the carbonate which helps a lot when buying a 'centre' and they're important in the game.
Conclusion: I like it and my GF likes it although she finds that it lasts way too long. Near the end she usually starts to hope that it will end soon.

Very good 2-P card game with an adventure theme with an hour game time generally. There are some catan familiar elements, but it's never a reduced version of the catan boardgame nor starfarer boardgame. It's an original game. I love the adventure deck exploration mechanism. The competition between players is very tight. The gameplay, learning curve are lighter-weighted than its sister Catan Card Game.
There are also official missions to increase the replayability. Have not yet tested the missions. But I still love this game.

I bought this game at DragonCon 04.  There is alot to like about this game, and only a little to not like.  I like the retro sci-fi theme, I like the bits, I like the mechanics, and I like the adventure and exploration.  I do think the game runs a touch long, and the setup is a little complicated.

Note to new players: The tutorial bordered on painful (You do the normal setup, and then the tutorial tells you to re-do half of it), but the game was fun.  If you have played any of the Catan games, just read the rules, setup normally, and dive in.  Fix your mistakes in the next game.

Only one play so far, but was enjoyed, I think I will up the rating after I've played it a few more times.  Still have to get a full game of Starfarers in though...

Although it frequently feels like a race to get the second level modules, this is invariably pretty close. Upgrading your ship and blasting pirates is hard to beat too.

A great little two player game. Only it's not that little, the box is and always generates the comment," How does it all fit?". The production is excellent, you see Mayfair you can do it, nice thick cardstock and quality cards, in a tiny box that is packed to the brim.Mr Teuber has again designed a great game. Remember this is at the lower price range for decent games, and to able to create a game with this level of depth and fun in this bracket he is to be appluded.

Never got into this game, found it a bit confusing. Suspect it would repay more effort but I prefer two player basic Settlers. Perhaps I am just too lazy for this one?

I really like this game. It does a good job of the feeling of exploration for such a compact game. Memory helps, but I like the fact that I can't quite remember where everything is. A bit long, so it's hard to get played for a 2 player. However, I bet with experience you could get it down to about 75 minutes.

I always enjoy some capriciousness in my games (Yes, they use the word capriciousness in the rulebook) so I play with the variant that the replacement cards go into the flight plan piles face down. I want to play a few games using a different starting module. The rulebook recommends the logistic module so I've only started with that one so far but the trade module and scanner module could be good as well.

RATING: 3
Got rid of. This game was approximately 40 minutes too long, and it's an hour-long game. 

There's about as much player interaction as two strangers reading books in different countries. Namely zero, which makes the game seem even longer and slower than it is.

It's like Catan combined with Galaxy Trucker with all the fun sucked out of both games. Imagine Catan if you couldn't speak to your opponents (or gesture or pull funny faces) and Galaxy Trucker if it took six turns to place a single part.

Starship Catan is a two-player card game that is thematically similar to Starfarers of Catan, but has different game play. Players explore randomly shuffled decks of cards looking for potential colonies, good trading deals, opportunities to help planets, and either avoid or combat pirates. Players can upgrade their ships' systems, including weapons to combat the pirates, thrusters to be able to explore further each turn, scanners to see (and avoid) cards that are coming up, and several others. Victory points are earned by establishing colonies, building upgraded ship's systems, having the most friendship points, and having the most hero points. The first player to 10 VP's wins. Expanded By: Starship Catan - 1st Mission: The Space Amoeba, Starship Catan - 2nd Mission: The Asteroid, Starship Catan - 3rd Mission: The Diplomatic Station. Starship Catan is part of the Kosmos two-player series and the Catan Series.

Not bad, but not quite what I would like it to be, either.  It's definitely better than the luck-heavy Starfarers of Catan (ugh), but it favors people with a better memory, and there are times when it comes down to who gets the lucky draw and/or roll.  Still, there are elements present to allow you to overcome a bad run of luck.

Takes concepts from the Settlers Card Game and refines/expands them in a 2-player offering. Excellent!

RATING: 7
Fun, but too long, changing the victory points down from 10 to 7 to win would make this game more enjoyable. It is fun to play after watching Firefly. The ships feel like the "serenity" as you get goods and set up trades, then get attacked by space pirates.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A very nice spin-off of the Catan game. Actually one of the best. The intergalatical voyage by exploring cards is much fun. What am I going for? Scare off the pirates by buying lasers or going deeper into the space with buying an extra turbo? Nice choices and always enjoyable.

RATING: 7
It's shocking to me that this is out of print. I think the Catan label hurts it a bit, because there is almost nothing in common between this 2-player only, quick play game and anything else in the Catan line. It feels like a card game version of Merchant of Venus and honestly, I find it far more interesting than that bloated, over-chromed mess. The exploration mechanism is very clever, providing a sense of danger but keeping that danger on a manageable level early on and slowly escalating it as the players can better cope with it. That gives everyone some control over their encounters, which many games in this genre lack. 

I also think trading aspects strike an almost perfect balance between simplicity and brain-burning strategic planning.

This needs a reprint, because I don't have it...and it's one of the best two-player games I've ever been exposed to. If you see it, snag it. You won't be disappointed.

The first game left me feeling lost in space, but Starship Catan was lots of fun from the second game on. The interaction between players is minor, mostly racing for the advanced modules and adventures with forced trading on the side, but the game works well. I've downloaded the special scenarios from Teuber's site and look forward to trying them sometime.

RATING: 6
Fine game, with lots of interesting things going on.  Memory is paramount, with some meaningful strategic decisions, all tempered by some luck.

But it takes too flipping long, which really hurts in comparison to other good 2-player games.

I like this 2-player version much better then the bigger one (Starfarers of Catan), since this doesn't take ages to play through and it's easier to get into and  has more action.

I'm not as fond of this as Dorque is, I think mostly because I'm not too big on space games. It's simple enough, and fun once you get into it, but the whole concept of running around the galaxy trading stuff kind of bores me.

We love Settlers of Catan the Card Game. We play it every single day with the expansions. Eventhought this game has the same system it is different enough to say we found a second great game to play everyday or take turns :D

The system is very much like the SOCCG but you have to explore sectors of the space, fight pirates, TRADE A LOT and build a better ship. You have to quest for the galactic council and establish trade and commerce posts. It's very refreshing to see they just didn't change the theme and kept the system but made a whole new game with a very solid system. A must for anybody.

Players are lost in space in a race to explore, trade, colonize and develop technology.  The first few games can take a long time as players learn how all the options work.  The game itself is really good - not too hard or too random, and is plenty of fun.

I played it and had a great feeling about it. After another play or two.. it's just simply too long for what it is. If it were 30 minutes, It would be nearly a 10. At 2 hrs or so, its far closer to a 7 (edit).. or a 6. :P

This is a fabulous game.  It gives a sense of exploration and uncertainty.  Also provides tension as you and your opponent race to be the winner.  The playing time is a little more than listed though.  I'd say it's a 90 - 120 minute game.

RATING: 6
This game loses points for me because it's 2-player only. I'd like it a bit more if it scaled but feel like there are better options at 2. It is a pretty cool game though. Customizing your ship and trying to remember what cards are in what pile is a nice touch. I did feel that the wheels were spinning a couple times and that it possibly takes too long to get going, but it is a nice little game with great components. Still a healthy dose of randomness/luck due to die rolls which could have contributed to the slow start/mid-game. I think as long as it stays right at 90 minutes it's a decent game but any longer would drop it a bit for me.

Reasonably fun, mostly silly. Not a whole lot of strategy - memory is the most significant skill element. Doesn't really feel like Catan at all, just borrows the name.

One of the best 2-player game i have tried so far. Quite simple rules, thick space-trading atmosphere, some nasty pirate dogfights, beautiful and rich game-pieces (for a small game), many decisions to make. The only drawback is the lenght.

Very satisfying 2 player game, with a modicum of luck and lots of light decision making and a fun "press your luck" element during your turn. Much meatier than the other Kosmos games, clocking in at just about an hour.

Visually stunning but the gameplay is not as good as the original Settlers Card Game. Players still choose which of a number of stacks to draw cards from, but the results are not nearly as diverse, making each decision less important than in the original. Still, it's an enjoyable game.

Truer to the spirit of the original Settlers game than the Settlers card game! However, as the designer's notes observe, this is a buy low/sell high game. Don't wait around for your colonies to provide.

RATING: 6
Really decent 2-player game and nice production.  There are plenty of things going on here with the rolling for resource, upgrading your ship, exploration and VP generation.  However, I'm not too big on the memory element and the random reliance on luck, especially in how the cards come out.  Seems too long for a small boxed title, and way too much set up/tear down required.

RATING: 7
I liked Starship Catan.  Interesting things going on, especially with the exploration of the different sectors.  Seems to be well-balanced.  There's not a whole lot of player interaction, though.  Unless I'm missing something.  I'd like to see if our next play goes by more quickly.  If not, I don't see Starship Catan being played much then, since I'd rather play quicker 2-players with Becky than that.

To repeat the comments I agree with: “playing a solitaire hand with your opponent stealing resources now and again”; ”repetitive”; ”anticlimatic”. Too bad a game with a few nice mechanics ends up like… this. I’ll play again, if someone insists (Hey; I’m a gamer!) but if given the choice I’ll play Settlers of Catan cardgame over this every day of the week & twice on Sunday

RATING: 9.75
If you do like Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) - like me!! - you should try this successor from 2005! FLB puts new variants to the old rules, like sweeping vedettes, hidden movement, action cards, etc. ....but still, it's a real "Zucker"!

...If you want to get a little further, try Markus Stumptner's refit: a new rule-variant. All for the game (rules, new counters, markers, etc.) at: http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/user/mst/games/lbn/lbn.html#refits.

I'm a fan of the system. These battles are fast and furious, and feel like they can go any way - especially Grossbeereen and Dennwitz and very different from the big set piece clashes.

I have very mixed feeling about this game.

Pros:

I like all the historical information concerning the maps and the order of battles.  There is great research that went into these games.

I agree with most of the above pros.

Cons:

Game mechanics are  more complicated than I care for.  For example, the game uses hidden movement.  Generally speaking unless one has a line of sight one does not know what is in a hex.  In order to compensate there are units that can serve as scouts (They are known a 'Vedettes').  If a player correctly employs his vedettes, he is going to know the disposition of the enemy anyway.  Instead one has to deal with a complicated, but realistic, game mechanic which simulates the 'fog of war'.  I have known other war games which accomplish this by employing simpler game mechanics which may not be as realistic but still produce the same results.

As others have mentioned, the rules are poorly written.  Some items are extremely difficult to find and one frequently has to make educated guesses.

Part 2:
See above comments by Strachwitz concerning the  the 'Thunderstorm' cards.  Apparently armies of that period carried with them contingents of rain dancers.  The only way one can have a thunderstorm is if a player plays the card.  So if you are on the defensive you can conjure up a thunderstorm to slow down the opposition.  OK.  For me this is really unrealistic.

It turns out Zucker eliminated the 'Thunderstorm' cards in COMING STORM.

Part 3:

Prior to now, all of my experiences have been solitaire.  When one is playing solitaire, one can easily overlook items.  Since I have started to play with another opponent every time we play we discover another problem that we can not resolve with the rules, all the errata or any of the discussion groups.  We gave-up and retired the game.

I hate to say it but this title seems to be the dog of the bunch.  I've not played all four scenarios but I have played the three which I'm told are the best and they pale in comparison to the excellent mix in TCS and solid group in TLS.

Comments on the LNB system in general.  

This system builds on the success of the classic Napoleon's Last Battles.  In solves the few issues that system had and provides a great value in a Quad format.

Unfortunately, the rule set has experienced, and continues to experience significant creep.  One would think that after all these decades the optimal balance would be reached, but as the designer has said it's like a fold in a rug, you push down and it pops up somewhere else.  

Additions like vedettes, hidden units, cavalry charges, supply trains, cards, and unit initiative have their strengths and weaknesses.  They're overlaid on a rather archaic ZOC/CRT chassis and the argument could be made that many of these updates simply aren't worth the bother.

Bottom line, we play a la carte, deciding which rules to use and which to ignore.  My opponents and I don't play with the cards for example.  If one wants to make a cavalry charge or break off vedettes they can, but the truth is there's rarely an advantage in doing so.

I rate games in this series based upon our way of playing them.  I'll grant that this may be sub-optimal play as over the years we've needed to become comfortable with a series of changes to the system and perhaps not all of those have" gelled". If the system received a significant overhaul that streamlined it a bit while modernizing the ZOC/CRT system; these games would probably rate a point or two higher.

Very nice game. Built upon the NLB system, it's a quick and fast learning affair. Experienced players will start playing in a breeze and new-comers will not be scared. The cards are a very nice addition to the system (even if their wild effect will un-balanced many games). Counters and map are very  nice and you get the usual competent hitorical commentary. Highly reccomended. As a side note this was the first and last wargame that my fiancé played (with a frien of mine).

Quatre batailles de taille réduites pour découvrir le système. Il faut prendre les dernières versions des règles de la série pour bien profiter du jeu.
Les scénarios sont tendus et intéressants pour les deux camps. Il manque juste un peu de place pour manoeuvrer. Les cartes des opus suivants (deux fois plus grandes) sont mieux adaptées aux exigences du système.

Comparing this the Days series (same framework) as opposed to the NLB series (same scale) really makes me appreciate this as a simple, clean representative of the Zucker system.  Had I compared it to NLB I would have felt it crowded, cramped, and needlessly complicated.  I expected to hate the cards, and I intensely disliked many of them I was forced to play, but they really do add a lot to the game.

Four Lost Battles is a breath of fresh air into hex and counter tactical wargaming that, for all its merits, might be a little stale nowadays. It is a step up in complexity from the old SPI quads, but the cards streamline the rules while adding dynamics missing from even the superb tactical hex games. With Four Lost Battles you'll never have a dull moment. I highly recommend this game to any wargamer and I hope other designers have taken notes on this offering from Kevin Zucker and Alessandro Fontana.

this is a complex and compelling simulation... but it's also a very good game! let's me explain why.
First of all, it isn't a remake or a revamping of Nap Last Battles or Leipzig, it's a complete rework of the mechanics of those games with a very different design and historical philosophy. 
In a few words this system, who resides on playing at various times during the game some cards, is about "friction" during napoleonic warfare. In practice, when you play this simulation with the rules regarding the cards you don't play only against your opponent but also against a host of different problems regarding movement of forces, weather, retards in reinforcement... 
With this in mind, you "are" immersed in a simulation that deserves a high level of attention by the players and suppose a deep understanding of napoleonic warfare at operational level AND a game with an endless re-playability. 
So, on this level Four Lost battles isn't a game for the occasional player BUT, if you play without the cards, you are on a different, more basic "ground": units go where you want to go and at a rate that does not change from turn to turn. 
So, when you play this system you can choose between two broad approaches: the "simple" "battle game", where your "only" problems regard the "control" of the forces under your command "during a napoleonic battle" or a study of the problems you have if you wage war on "grand tactic" level in the napoleonic age.

So, this is a game "and" a simulation and the choice it's up to you. 

In my opinion, Kevin Zucker and his fellows made a great work on both fields.
I deeply recommand this game to anyone who has an interest in these topics.    

the rating is "relatively low" because the rules deserve a general clarification/stabilization AND the scenarios are mixed in quality.

RATING: 8
Very good: Tactical - Napoleonic - Medium

Plus: 
-Unsurpassed historic feel / one of the most evocative games
-Super production quality 
-Innovative system with cards determining events such as reinforcements / wheather
-Gameplay is tactical rahter than operational games and Zucker masters both. 
-You can play a 'campaign' where the outcome of one battle influences the other. 

Minus:
-One sided nature of the battles (well the title gives this one away). French can pull 1 or 2 wins but are really the underdog. I'd rather saw a Quadriga on the battles of Waterloo this style!
Update: Kevin Zucker heard our voices and comes with a Quadriga on some great battles.
-Some 'unrealistic' events as you can call in a thrunderstorm by playing cards.

General Comments:
This game makes me feel I am going back in time 200 years. Great components. Theme about lesser known but essential engagements that were the prelude to Leipzig. Good 'what if' scenario. Campaign game where the outcome of two battles influence the course of the following two battles. Innovative and exciting card support. Good playability / replay value. Stunning map & counters.
Kevin Zucker must be the reincarnation of Napoleon himself and this game is a must have for grognards and wargame interests.

Sold it after I got an offer I could not refuse.

After all these years, I still find the Zucker-NLB system gives me the best feel for Napoleonic operational level warfare. If you like Nap last Battles you will probably like this one. I appreciated the cards which adds variabilty to each play...though at the expense of a possible blow out for one side.  Recent changes in the rules/CRT have improved the artillery systems and the cavalry charge, availible from their site.

You definetely need the newest charts and rules to do the work that is necessary to get this gem running.
But it is worth the time.

The small battles are a very good way to start with the System.The rules are a little bit more complex and different than Coming Storm, but basically they are the same.

The introduced cards give the battles a great variety for the reinforcements that you can expect and the movement points the units get.

Great replay value.

Another game worth anticipating for from Kevin Zucker.  4 little known battles. The victory conditions seems to be less balanced than it should have been.  Some say that the French really have problem winning the game.  Some concerns about the effects of the rules of the artillery.  However, the components are top notch and elegant, including the box package!

Four games in one package, readily playable because each game does not have a huge amount of counters. Components are all very good. Maps are splendid. Counters could be better graphically, adding some interesting eagle symbols or flaming grenades for guard and grenadier troops for example. But the counters are functional. The use of the cards can send things in directions that aren't as realistic as I like, but over-all a very good system.

RATING: 7.5
Card-assisted descendent of the classic Napoleon's Last Battles and Napoleon at Leipzig systems, covering four obscure meeting engagements resulting in French defeats or checks during the 1813 Dresden campaign. Thus the battles are "lost" in both senses of the word.

Here's how it works. You start a turn by drawing a card. You'll have two or three in your hand already, and you must play one. Playing a card does several things. First, it establishes your basic movement rates for the turn to come (your troops may not always be able to utilize their full movement allowance). Playing a card may also mean you have to check for a change in weather, or check the supply status of your troops. It may provide an opportunity to reorganize "destroyed" units. And finally, it will trigger an event, often having to do with the arrival and composition of reinforcements, either your own or the enemy's. Playing a card, any card--and keep in mind you MUST play one every turn--will cost you VP if the card event helps you and garner you VP if the card event hurts you. While there's obviously a lot riding on the choice of the card to play I for one find it sometimes hard to balance ALL of those variables--movement, event, VP, maybe something else--to feel like I'm always making a smart decision. And yes, there's the possiblity of the gears locking and the machine freezing up when incompatible events present themselves (though this has happened less often in my games then one might have thought).

After that the system becomes more familiar, at least to those acquainted with Zucker's earlier games. You've got command, for instance. Commanders command Officers (or individual units), Officers command units in their corps, all units must be in command to function well though they can roll against their own initiative, as can officers if they're not in command from a Commander. Full movement therefore requires not only the appropriate card play but also a proper chain of command. And reasonable weather. You have a Road March formation to take advantage of roads, not to be confused with March Orders (which allow reinforcements to move to certain points on the map without necessarily being in command). You have vedettes, which are light cavalry units useful for scouting (did I mention forces keep their identities hidden until they close)? You have bridges which can be burnt and pontoon trains with which to rebuild them. You have supply trains. The CRT has a Shock result, which means units with a higher initiative have an edge when the odds ratio is low. Cavalry charges are a little more involved than they used to be. Artillery has a separate table for bombarding.

It's all a little messy, it requires some patience and bookkeeping, but it *is* fun and I consider this one of my best game purchases in the last year. The cards plus the command rules did combine to create a pacing that produced an absolutely believable battle narrative with none of the telescoping and factor bashing of the old NLB. A division might see action for an hour or two then not for the rest of the day; combat was the climax of a series of maneuvers, not the constant state of the game. 

My one big gripe is what someone else generously described as "the malleability of the rules." The game is constantly being tweaked and revised in its folder on CSW. Be sure you get the latest errata (some of it quite significant), chart revisions, quick start rules, and whatever else from OSG before you play.

Components are all top notch, the maps are simply outstanding.

The cards can give very strange, sometime hilarious, results. The battles are too small to be really interesting: in La Katzbach, the French player's striking force consists of 4 counters (Macdonald's infantry). But the game is colorful and somewhat fun. Could be a good introductory wargame.  I sold it in 2006.

First impressions after playing "The Katzbach" scenario:

Contrarily to other players here, I’ve found the rules not well written and difficult to understand! [For example, I’ve had to read 5.4 on Ney several times just to understand the meaning of the sentence.]

The rules are labeled version 3.22 and I still have to read additional errata and examples somewhere else - in the getting started document - Come on!

The cards have a substantial impact on game play and it may feel weird sometimes....

Attacks are mandatory as soon as you are in an EZOC. So, units in town are compelled to attack enemy units outside it! You cannot defend in town: I’ve found this side effect unrealistic... Especially if I compare with Didier Rouy’s "Vive L’Empereur" Series...

To sum up : I have mixed feelings on this game system.

I wanted to rate this game higher but the rules are too full of holes and ambiguities for me.

There are too many grey areas and situations that are not covered. The rules are not that complicated, just sloppily written. It is a bit of a shame really but also seriously frustrating.

The cards add a lot of replay value and do a good job of conveying the chaos and uncertainties of warfare, I like them except the ones you have to pick at the start, I don't think it really makes sense to draw more than one here.

The counters are beautiful but I don't think the maps are visually appealing personally, a bit bland and the ways the hills and slopes are depicted, Kulm in particular which is a jumbled mess.

All in all, not a bad game at all, it has a lot of historical flavour, interesting mechanisms but plagued by sub par rules IMO.

This represented my first serious venture into Napoleonic games & it's worth it.

Components : the maps look great.  Two map sheets are included, each divided between two battles.  The typical terrain aid info is posted on each as well as a color-coded formation guide making parent units / organizations easy to identify.  

The counters are on a thick stock which is nice and have a glossy look which works great with the colors on the counters (differing colors for differing nationalities).  Units are largely at brigade and regimental level with a the standard "NATO" icon look. 

Rules are another plus - written in a style that is easy to follow and understand as well as reference during gameplay.  

The playaids are also solid although the CRT has had some slight issues (see below).  Included are charts to track corps morale and turns for each battle.

Finally are the cards which impact gameplay.  Quality is just as nice as any deck of playing cards.  Each card has it's own small piece of artwork reflective of the action listed on the card.  Actions are clearly stated & reference rules where necessary.

CRT.  Since the game was published serveral revisions have been made and unmade to the CRT.  Please check the OSG / CSW websites to get the newest.  Although you may think this reveals something broken in the game, it does just the opposite.  The revisions have had virtually no impact on the rules or gameplay other than to make it slightly more historically accurate from my gameplay experience.

Gameplay : for some reason I was expecting a slow, lockstep game, but got just the opposite.  Combat moves quickly and includes decisions on bombardment, cavalry charges, and finally the close attack which all essentially happen at once and impact the fight (i.e. combined arms bonuses and the cavalry's ability to essentially hold a unit in plce and make retreats after combat very painful).  The CRT can also be deadly if it drives you to make a Shock check since unit quality across the boards is relatively poor due to the heavy concentration on conscript soldiers in all armies.  Movement is also an unknown - units are rated for a basic allowance, but that is modified by the cards that each player plays before his turn begins so units may move faster or slower than printed.  Overall the card play becomes key.  It not only drives the movement allowances of your armies, but may force you to make decisions or take actions that you would not want to do (i.e. retreats, no attacks, etc...) but can also greatly aid your fight (i.e. alternate reinforcements, earlier arrival of scheduled reinforcements, or the ability to delay your opponents reinforcements), as well as adding or subtracting from your VP level.  At this point, even though some cards could ruin your chances of winning, I've yet to get a hand of cards that was complete / guaranteed ruin, but be warned, it is possible.

Playtime : my games have moved pretty quickly.  You are working with half maps and pretty low counter density and the chance that not all of your units may be able to move / fight.  Some battles can stretch into a second day due to card play, so there is a chance a short scenario could be a bit longer. 

Balance : This is tough for the French since Nappy and the Guard are not really available (except thru card play) in any of these fights.  That said, the Coalition is not much better off as unit & leadership quality is generally poor all around.  The cards can influence things for sure, but the only chance (I think) for the French is to be aggressive almost to the point you would not in other games.  Makes for challenging fights for sure, but nothing I would call unbalanced.

This game is quite simply superb. You get excellent graphics and production values and 4 different (but linked) battles. You can play individual battles or play all four sequentially for a campaign. The card system is inovative, but I find it works well, and the result is that no game is ever the same twice even if you try to play it the same. the cards ensure that the hand of fate away from the battle field makes its presence felt.

I have played this lots solo and have great fun, unfortunately my ftf gaming partner is still getting used to this one and the result seems to be slower games, but he will get there soon enough.

I would heartily recommend this to anyone.

Card assisted game which is supposed to be a strength, but we found the opposite to be true (some really strange things do happen). Very slow to get into (dense rules), but once the battle gets going it's not too bad (and on a half-map, to boot). Great graphics. 

UPDATE: After playing (and very much enjoying!) Napoleon at Leipzig, I overwhelmingly prefer NaL to 4LB, which is way too fiddly for my tastes. I have played both ftf and solitaire, and 4LB is too much of a headache.

4LB is a valiant attempt, but ultimately it just does not hold together as the individual parts sum up to an unwieldy beast. Sold.

I have mixed feelings about this game. 

I bought this game last year. As has been mentioned before the there are holes in the rules. This is disappointing, especially if you consider that the basic system behind this game is very old. There would have been enough time for the rules to evolve. Also it would have been nice if all the errata would have been incorporated into the rulebook. As it is now, you can throw away the rulebook that comes with the game, download the rules form the OSG site and print them out on your own. A way to make the system work is by using the rules provided by Markus Stumptner.  
The quality of the components is for the most part low. Some sheets look like they have been photocopied for the 20th time.
Given the high price of the game, the quality does not relate.
The map looks nicely and is functional but there are better looking maps, e.g. the Napoleon at Leipzig map.  
I like the counters which are colourful. All the information you need can be gathered by a quick glance. Also the quality of the cards left a good impression.

On the pro side the games presents unique battles which can't be found anywhere else. So for I played the Grossbeeren scenario solo to get into the rules. The random cards can have a very big impact on the game. At the same time the consequences for a player can be severe. If you are forced to play several cards that decrease the victory level (as happened to the French in the game I was playing), it may be almost impossible to win. More playings are needed to comprehend the effect of the cards. If you prefer to play solitaire, the cards make the game more interesting.  

Btw. before writing this review I just returned from Grossbeeren with my bike :-)

(2009-10-15) The change of scale from the days series adds more fun in the form of artillery and cavalry charges. The combined arms attacks must now be done with guns, men and horses. Otherwise the system is the same with minor adjustments to fit the novelties. The time scale multiplies day turns and divides night in two turns.
The biggest difference is the use of cards, even though it looks like the game would be playable without them. They are used to add some randomness in the events, but they do not drive the game per se. However, their use is mandatory and as such, randomness becomes chaos. Maybe playing a card every 3 or 4 turns may help to stabilise the game a bit. Their forced use, along with their strong effects on the game, is what costs the game a rating of 8 it should deserve.

(2014-06-27) Playing the game with the new LNB rules is a breeze. The lack of commanding officers at each battle challenges the French side, while the Coalition has a number advantage. Each scenario can be played in a bit more than a half day.

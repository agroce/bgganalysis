RATING: 10
My rating is for the standard paper-and-pencil party game - I've actually never even seen this "designed" box version.  Easily played this one 50+ times over the years.  Great party game that ALWAYS results in laughs, jeers, triumph, disbelief - such a great feeling correctly guessing how everyone's gonna think, and sometimes just as cool being so far afield.  Of course, when you match everyone you're a genius, and when you don't everyone else is an idiot :p

A very good party game for adults.  Does not require any skill.  The only reason why It's for adults is that kids would simply not understand some of the questions relying on less common knowledge.  Not a game that will slow down with more players.  Plays well with 6.

RATING: 5.5
Party game where you try to guess the most popular answers to the questions, which are not necessarily the correct answers.  Played with pencil and paper - do I need to buy the game?

A very fun card game of group think.  Complex in it's simplicity and very entertaining.  It's a pity that it's discontinued.

The simplicity of the gameplay and potential number of players makes it a great game.  The interesting questions that come with the game make it a 10.

Initial review:   I really enjoyed this game.   It's a little like Unanimo and Say Anything had a child together.  I also like how it's not ALL "name 5 things".   There are a bunch of different options, including true/false type stuff.  

Its  main problem, however, is in determining what a match is.   "scientist" and "scientists" are clearly the same.   But what about "planets" and "solar system"?   Or "mysteries" and "unexplained events", etc?     So that's a bit of a problem.   The other issue that I doubt there is much re-playability with the same group of people once the cards have been gone through.  Once a question is used, it's probably done for at least a few years.   Same issue as Say Anything.

Initial rating is an 8.

Played as "Sheep" here on BGG PBFs.  It's super duper fun.

RATING: 8
While I own a copy of this game in the USA, here in Australia I play the "homemade" version, where each player submits a category ("mythological creatures" or "things that are red" or whatever) and then everyone writes three answers for each category.  Every player who gives an identical answer is worth one point to those players (so if three people write "Pegasus", they each get three points).  I find it to be good fun and an excellent party game, though there is the possibility of a low score if you're not on the same mindset as all the other players (such as if you're an American playing with all Australians...).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great party game!  The beauty of this one is that it can handle virtually an unlimited amount of people.  In fact the more the better, except for the guy who has to count up all the votes.  I once played this with 13 people and we had a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Perfect concept for a group who has various levels of trivial knowledge and/or strategic ability - because this game requires neither!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
When I first played it, I liked it very much.  It&#039;s sheen wore off for me fairly quickly.  It&#039;s key to answer as others might, as opposed to answer truthfully for yourself.

RATING: 5
Similar to WaveLength, which I think works better. My playing group has too many friendly disagreements over whether answers match.

RATING: 7
It's match game, for crying out loud.  A good enough party game that plays better when the participants make up their own questions.

I have actually never played this bought version.  We just play the homemade version and I wanted to rate that game.

I'm not sure if this game would be more fun or less fun.  I like that we get to come up with the topics, but looking over the picture of cards here on the BGG, it looks like there are some interesting twists that we don't play when we play the homespun version.

Anyhow, the bottom line is that this is a FUN party game.

RATING: 7.5
If I'm having a party with non-gamers this is the first thing I pull out.  You can think and joke around without it being all "touchy-feely". A "10" among party games and a 5 overall results in a score of 7.5

So fun with a large group!  We do a round of "Make up your own question" when someone is close to losing, and it usually has hysterical results.

RATING: 9.4
One of the best party games ever.  Any number, most any age can play, you don&#039;t have to be smart, in fact it helps to be average.  When asked for your favorite food, don&#039;t answer &quot;corn beef and cabbage&quot;, try something a little more normal.

Quick party/filler game.  You can play the game without actually having a copy of the "game."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun party game that can easily be played by any number with just pens and paper. Each turn, one person selects a topic, such as "Movie Musicals," then everyone writes 5 answers. When revealing, any answer that no one or everyone put is worth zero, and all others are worth points equal to the number who had that answer. Agonizing decisions come from whether or not to put the obvious answer. If you do and everyone else does, it's worth zero to all. But if you don't, and everyone else does, they all get a lot of points you miss out on. Great fun.

No, I don't own the box game; but I do own pencils and paper.  Used to be 'my favorite game I'll never win', but then I won.  Don't have to be a gamer to play.

RATING: 9.9
Best with 4, 5, 6, 7 players
Recommended with 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, more than 10 players 

The kids are finally old enough to play this. I've had to sell three other copies because we were not ready yet.

Some of the questions we had to skip:

"If you could cheat on your taxes and get away with it, would you do it?"

and

"Would you wait in line 30 minutes if gas was 25 cent cheaper?"

are beyond them. So we played that if they did not "get" the question, they could make up their own.

They liked it. 

Light, breezy, party game along the line of Apples To Apples. 

Very nice family game with lots of player interactiveness.

Fairly simple group think game. The right answer is the most common one ... even if it is wrong. That is the interesting twist ... if you are tuned in to the crowd you will win even if you aren't that knowledgeable. If that appeals to you ... so will this game.

RATING: 7.5
Party type game that my group will play at a moment's notice.  We always just invent our own categories, which is part of the fun.  
Ultra simple.  Call out a category.  All players write down 5.  Score points = # of players who chose that item, as long as there was at least 1 match.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I was dumb enough to go for the boxed version, but I think I needed the confidence of playing with some of the premade cards before trying to get people to play it with pencil and paper.  Now that I know how to play it seems like it would be more fun to make up your own categories.

This is a great game for large player counts, being so simple and easy to teach yet creating some laughs and a surprisingly satisfying experience.

Never actually played the boxed version of this, but with enough pens and paper, you have all you need. Like most good party games, scoring is unimportant; it's fun whether you're winning or losing.

Decent party game -- biggest draw is that Garfield designed it.  Also, love that there is only one loser.  Game should of just been all lists instead of solo questions.

RATING: 10
We play a version of this game that we call "Normality": Players take turn choosing a subject. For each subject everybody writes down 5 entries matching the subject. When everyone has finished the players get points for entries that they were not alone in writing. The points they get are equal to the number of players writing this entry. I.e you should try to write entries that others also will write (i.e be "Normal"). So for each entry a player gets either 0 points (he/she was alone with this entry) or 2 or more (up to the number of players) points.

I only play the homemade, parlor game version. Lots of fun, but be sure to pick categories that give everyone a fair shot. (One bad game had my sister-in-law almost left out by categories. No fun.)

RATING: 7.7
4 p.  We had a blast playing this at gamers night (just the pencil & paper concept).  Some of the categories were surprisingly low-scoring, like "villains."   Big laughs when I suggested "numbers 1-100" for the bonus round.  Even bigger laughs during the next game when another player suggested "fractions" as a tease.  Another offbeat category was "playing cards."

Woo-hoo!  Finally got a copy through BGG marketplace.  My expectations were so high I was sure I'd be at least somewhat disappointed.  Not so! Played twice already and we laughed long and hard during both plays.  Can't imagine this will ever feel flat.  Fun, fun, fun.

We only use categories with lists usually. Literal explosions of laughter. Can be wonky though if played with people from other cultures, since their answers rarely match up and score points.

I like the concept of this better than the game.  Neat idea, but didn't play well with our group.  And it sells for way more than its worth on eBay, so I sent my copy on its way.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable party game.  However, we generally ignore the "True/False" questions, since everyone just started answering "True" for all of them.  (After all, the goal isn't to be correct, but rather to vote like everyone else...)

The only true party game released by Wizards of the Coast and the only one designed by Magic:tg creator Richard Garfield. This is one of my favorite party games although sometimes it falls short. I got two copies for Christmas the year it came out and they were both differnt versions. One has a score track and the other had penalty cards you collect when you lose a round. I prefer the card version because to the funny sayings on the cards.

My favorite of the "small group" party games.  Good for 4-6 players.  Works best if you just make up your own questions, or at least take your choice from the card you draw.  (In other words, skip the spinner.)

Awesome party game.  Easily one of the best ones around, but I can't imagine paying for it and using the cards that they supply you with.  I much prefer to make up topics and use a pencil and paper.  Surprisingly, can be a disaster if people pick pure opinion topics like "best first albums" or obscure topics like "biggest breast".

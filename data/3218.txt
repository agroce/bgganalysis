This may be the most detailed of the Panzerblitz series, but I don't really enjoy the period as much as WW2 and the sides are less interesting - Israel is pretty strong.

After recently playing this again for the first time in almost 30 years, I can say that I still prefer micro-tank warfare - as I did then.  The rules for that are much better and more fun.  

I'd say this game is ok at best, when using the advanced rules, and it's not something I'd want to revisit a second time.  And don't bother with the basic rules - boy are they a pile of pants - utterly unrealistic and silly.

My First wargame that I bought with my own lunch money.

Plays well but there are scenarios that may seem unbalanced. Need more plays on them to appreciate those scenarios.

Average on the rules by standards these days.

A very good game that mixes various aspect of Infantry power in CAT attacks, Tanks' firepower and Range of Artillery.

A simple Classic wargame to be played again and again to truely enjoy the system.

Instructive simulation of post-WWII middle east conflicts, demonstrating how the Israeli must play 'flawlessly' to survive: make no (major) mistake, and the Arab player is effectively shut-out; but make that error, and the overwhelming massed Arab forces will exploit it beyond the Israeli's ability to recover.

RATING: 5
Not a bad attempt at fire and maneuver and being able to play out many scenarios from 1948-1973.  The Black September scenario is the best and worth playing (Jordanians vs. PLO and Syrians).  However, the game mechanics for ATGMs, and helicopters, and artillery were cumbersome;  It is also very mechanical and fails to account for other aspcts of combat to include morale, leadership, cohesion, friction, etc and other considerations.  I would no longer recommend it int he modern gaming era.   Fun back in the 80's, but the the counter and map art is lacking, and the mechanics have been greatly surpassed by other systems.

The third and best installment in the PanzerBlitz series of games. Very little to recommend it these days other than it's (comparative!) simplicity and playability.

The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

I played this a lot when I was a kid when it came out.  It's a good refinement of the PB/PL system, correcting many of the problems with the other games, though unfortunately it retains some of the basic flaws of that system.  The rules are probably more complex than needed.  Like the other two games, competitive play balance is often seriously lacking (most of which can be addressed by changing victory point awards, I think).  There is also a lack of 1956 and 1967 scenarios, but Alan Arvold has solved that problem by publishing a bunch for each war in Old Soldiers.

Unfortunately, there is not much out there on this topic and scale, and most of that is disappointing.  October War (by SPI) was a MUCH better system, though it lacked a lot of the scope, as well as most of the 'bells and whistles'.  As such, despite its age, this is still a good game to pick up if you are interested in the topic.

RATING: 7
Adds additional complexity to the PanzerBlitz/Panzer Leader system, but this stretches the basic system a bit, which seems less suitable for the modern battlefield.

It is still a good game, but it is rated relative to the other two, which are particularly well suited to their situations. I played it a few times and that was enough.

Top quality components, of course (AH).

There are situations that are impossible for the Arab player to win, if the Israeli player is competent and thorough. House rules must be adopted in such cases.

RATING: 6
While certainly the best in the evolution of the PANZERBLITZ/PANZERLEADER series, the reduction in movement factors did much to deflate the "zip" of the game, even if far more realistic than its predecessors.  The scenarios are often difficult for one side or the other and have been accused of being slightly unbalanced.  The maps are the blandest, unfortunately, and that contributes to the face this game sees less play than its forebears.  One of the strongest elements of the game was the research into the order of battle for the belligerents; most other tactical games on the same situations, notably SPI's OCTOBER WAR and SUEZ TO GOLAN (MECH WAR 2) had "cookie cutter" tables of organizations and equipment applied.  Lastly, the sheer variety of situations and circumstances are another high point of the game as other tactical games usually only deal with the 1967 and 1973 wars.  

This is an old game but still holds up well since there is little real competition in scope, breadth, and treatment.  There may be others with more depth in narrow areas, but overall this title remains the best single wargame on its topic.

Enjoyed this one in my teens.  It was a natural progression after PanzerLeader & PanzerBlitz to the modern era.  I liked the morale/rally rules and adapted them (albeit subjectively) to the PL & PB scenarios.  Felt more "realistic" than the earlier games.  It is said the game is unbalanced ... well yes, but so were the conflicts represented.  The Israelis won more battles (or scenarios) than they lost ... which side "won" the wars is debatable.

RATING: 4.5
Panzerblitz moves to the Middle East.  Some refined rules, but still IMHO suffers from its heritage:  "Dispersion" and its lack of relevance at the platoon and company levels.  Did not adequately model the BMP-1 and its combination of Sagger and 73mm low-pressure gun.  Some airpower, but little to nothing in the way of tactical air defenses (a KEY part of the 73 war).  It was OK, but the miniatures guy in me wasn't overly impressed.  Gave it away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fantastic game system that can be taught and played in a single evening.

Panzer Leader goes to the Mid-East and it fixes just about all that was still screwed up from "Panzer Blitz" and did not get right in "Panzer Leader".  Always wished they did another edition of both with these rules.

All in all a great game that needed more/better scnearios and boards (note: the scenarios esp. the very first are the game's greatest failing as they tend to be very poorly balanced, see the old AH public domain magazine the "General" for many new scenarios, articles, etc.)

TODAY this is still the best game to play in < 4 hours on the subject matter...but loses an entire point due to the absolutely horridly balanced scenarios.

Post World War II Panzer Leader: Israel versus the rest of the Middle East. Same scale and basic rules as Panzer Leader with a few extra goodies added to reflect the nature of post World War 2 desert warfare, such as jet fighters, helicopters and Sagger missiles. Scenarios cover pretty much every major conflict involving Israel from 1954 to 1973.
Scale: 5 tanks per tank counter. Infantry counters represent one platoon.
Old school sequence of play: Indirect fire, Direct fire, Movement. Opportunity fire against moving units.

I'm afraid I was disappointed by this one. It's showing its age with its Igo-Ugo tactical design. The graphical presentation isn't particularly compelling. Somehow the  rules feel like they could be streamlined. They're overwritten and the charts are just ugly to look at. There might be a really good game in some of the many scenarios included. You'll just need to put in some serious effort to get to it.

Not really a fair rating, I guess, as it's aged.  Then again, I didn't stick with Panzerblitz 25 years ago, either.

The Arab-Israeli Wars is the last of series of games that began with Panzerblitz.  TAIW is probably the most realistic of the three.  My only gripe with TAIW is that in my opinion, the game makes the Israeli units unrealisticly strong and the Arab units unrealistically weak.  Otherwise, I really like this one and play it more than the other two games in the series.

Best of the 'first generation' tactical armor games (i.e PB-PL) The lower movement rates and opportunity fire helps the game. This versions fixed some of the worse realism issues in the others (like tanks vs towns) Also all platoons are based on the same 3 tank unit, thus the defense factors feel more realistic.

The addition of terrain features like the Suez Canal and units like TOW missiles and helicopters add fun new wrinkles to this installment of the Panzerblitz system.  Like all the Panzerblitz games, the components are a bit drab and the mechanics have a dated feel in 2006.  It's really hard to feel, beyond the dry numerical factors, what distiguished the Arab and Israeli forces.  However, the game remains entertaining with solid, balanced scenarios.

A game based on the WW2 Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader published by the same Avalon Hill.  They are all tactical level games simulating tank actions. A big shoot'em engagement between both sides on the desert. These games are comparatively complex as to other games published by Avalon Hill since a lot of micromanagement is involved, e.g. line of sight, ammunition, reaction fire etc.  Not really my cup of tea but it did have its appeal when I was younger. Check out the PC game "Steel Panther" series by SSI.  They have the same focus as these boardgames and a lot more easier to play and control, relieving you very much of the micro details so that you can focus on the overall tactical situation.

Best of the three similar systems, including Panzer Leader and Panzer Blitz?  Not sure, but pretty close.  More depth here, since the battles are more modern and you have weapons like missiles that you do not have in the other two.  

Great system, if a bit too simplified for a truly accurate representation of modern warfare.  But any more complicated and the system might get unwieldy. As it is it flows pretty nicely yet contains deep tactical decision making.

Panzerblitz/Panzer Leader in the Mid-East.  Lots of scenarios and units gives this strong replay value, but some of the scenarios aren't well balanced.  It is still, however, a fun game to play, especially when you want to see a lot of armor slugging it out on the tabletop.

This title didn't so much as improve the Panzer Leader ruleset, as change it.  There were a few rules that improved play (e.g. opportunity fire) but many of the rules changes (such as the WEC, range, and combat) made this game less like its predecessors and more like its own system.  Played first 3 scenarios of the Standard Rules.

RATING: 7.5
PanzerBlitz's youngest sibling. Good game, and significantly more complex. Enough so that's it's worth treating it as it's own game. This is in part because problematic rules in PB and PL were fixed, and partly because modern warfare brings a higher diversity of weapons to the table.

 Good Game. Really liked the State-of-the Art of the
1970's weapons assignments. Egyptians use all Warsaw Pact issue like T-55's to T-72's, BMP's, Ect. 
Israeli's use everything from British Centurions, French AMX's to "Super Sherman" Tanks using a 105mm Gun. 
This was the war that historians call "The First Air-Land Battle" of modern times. Very well researched Scenarios and game.
 Game is designed from the "PANZERBLITZ" mold using
player/unit line-of-sight system. Not much shift given
to Air factors or support but the game is still quite playable with the scenarios provided.
 If a strong Offensive Game is what you crave, then this
game, especially the Egyptians crossing the Suez Canal Scenario is for you. Like AH's "STALINGRAD" a nail
 biter until the reserves arrive if that's not too late.

Halfway done playing through all the scenarios but had a blast so far.

Still, I do understand the design mechanic and appreciate the effort.

Last of the Panzerblitz trilogy. For a while this got played more than the others in the family but the attack to defence ratio of the Israeli to Arab AFV's seems a tad contrived & eventually led to it gathering dust.

Third in a series, after Panzer Blitz and Panzer Leader.  Benefits from lessons learned, offers greatly-improved game scale both in fire and in movement.  Stretched an elegant game system to the limit, and beyond, to its detriment; the level of abstraction waters down the more modern-era weaponry to an almost silly degree.  Best used for parts to add desert boards (Nordafrika, anyone?) and the updated weapons/movement tables to Panzer Blitz/Leader games.

Enjoying it very much.  I've read much about imbalance in the scenarios,  Maybe so, but so far betwixt us, the Arabs are 1-0 against the Israeli's and on their way to being 2-0.  And besides that, it's been fun and suspenseful.

This has strong nostalgia value to me.  In high school a friend of mine introduced me to this game.  It was the first wargame I ever played.  I was hopelessly confused and lost each time we played (only a few times).  Yet I could tell that there was something very cool with this type of game, and I was hooked.  Several years later, after becoming a true gamer, I saw this and bought it as a necessary part of my collection.

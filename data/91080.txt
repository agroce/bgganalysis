The first COIN. I studied it, played it alot and loved it. Then the co-op negotiating set in. Became weary of co-opting to stop a sudden win for a measly trade off due to ...many things. Cementing my belief that negotiation in board games is not my way of thinking.

Wonderful design and concepts but I don't negotiate in games.

I soloed this a bunch of times. I was doing extremely well with the cartels, until I noticed they were not supposed to be able to do certain actions in the 0 population departments. I've never won with the Government (and only once with the FARC). Since my last play I discovered another rules error that held the Government back a bit. Maybe I would have won with them.

The theme although is pretty interesting.

RATING: 9
Employs a *very* smart card-assisted turn-order/event system which creates often excruciating decisions. Never played with the AI, but with four, the wide-open diplomacy system can make for strange bedfellows and ratchet the tension even further – the best laid plans can always be undercut.  Multiple strategic paths to victory for each of the four factions and variability with the prop rounds make for little down time. Even when your faction is getting the shaft on Ops opportunities, there’s always something to be considering, countering, and worrying about. Clean and tight first entry in a very promising system; can’t wait to check out Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, and everything else coming down the COIN pike.

Interesting idea. The card mechanism is neat. The theme is unique. The graphic design is close to perfect (the only blemish is the color yellow on the setup shortcut printed on the board--it looks like lime instead of yellow). Everything is good, and yet...

The whole is not the sum of it's parts. Indeed, it fell way short. For a game about violence and drugs and terrorism, nothing felt very tense or difficult. Yeah, sometimes there were tough decisions, but overall the theme and the mechanics didn't connect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The COIN series is an excellent hybrid of Euro and Wargame. The CDG mechanic is very different to other CDG because players don't have a hand of cards. Also the games plays well with any number from 1 to 4, although the best number is 4. Personally I think Cuba Libre is more playable (shorter and clearer map) and has more interesting theme. Looking forward to playing Distant Plains

RATING: 8
Definitely a lot of rock-paper-scissor type of decisions, trying to maximize your moves since you are hoping that beneficial events don't come up while you are ineligible.  We will need to play this a few more time to figure out the basics.  5 hours since none of us were familize with the ops and events.  I like the dynamics of all the factions.

This is a well designed war game with assymetrical sides having assymetrical winning conditions.  If you like Twilight Struggle's card mechanics, you should definitely try this game since it seems to have taken that mechanic to its next logical level: multi-player games with more players.  I am not a huge fan of that mechanic.  For me, well, playing with the ongoing tragedy of the situation in Columbian is just not my idea of entertainment.

I think this might be one of the best multi-player wargames (with an euro-ish feel) that I've ever played. Even better than Friedrich or Successors and almost as good as Angola or Maria.

A lot of diplomacy and negotiation going on around the table, though. You have to like that kind of interaction during your games.

Great mechanics, and very good on simulating the real dynamics of the conflict. In short, a fantastic design, deserving a spot besides other great CDGs like For the People or Twilight Struggle, even though it doesn't follow the same CDG mechanics as created by Mark Herman.

The solo engine is a little convoluted, with the flow charts and all, but it is still very entertaining. It is tough.

Commencing some learning games of this. Started off with a 2 player walk thru of the tutorial.

A lot of Euro style mechanics, with the card play and turn order mechanic making an interesting twist.

The real challenge will be figuring out what to do when playing again...the choices with 2 players are pretty mind boggling, it would increase exponentially with 4 I would imagine. Until familiar with the game, there could be a risk of some serious AP downtime.

Initial rating of 8, as definately a game with a lot of possibilities. Each card/turn brings with it an agonizing range of choices.

Downgraded to a 7..it's an interesting game, but after a few plays it's not one I would want to play more than a few times a year.

Been a long time since I've been this impressed with a board game. This is what I wanted "A Line in the Sand" to play like. 

Four factions, each with very different goals and a thick political backdrop. Sadly, my one play was only two players, but I'm anxious to get this to the table with 4 people. 

Admittedly, I did not know very much about this conflict prior to playing the game, but after my first play, I find it amazing that Columbia is still a single state.

RATING: 8
The learning curve is initially more like a wall, but once the game is in motion, it all swiftly clicks into place and becomes somewhat intuitive. Once you achieve a degree of familiarity with your faction's capabilities, the game's careful assymetric balance quickly becomes apparent and you are free to immerse yourself into the theme. Being a GMT game, the rule book is typically clear and well written. This is a superior game that I am pleased to finally be able to sink my teeth into.

EDIT: Lacks a bit of the polish and balance of later COINs

RATING: 6
Initial Impression: This is an interesting 4 player game of temporary alliances and cooperation. The asymmetrical goals really shine in giving each player different motivations. However, the rules discourage specific alliances, which make the game feel a bit constricted. This is the nature of the conflict that the game is representing, so it's thematic in that respect but I'm not a big fan of this. As far as CDGs go, the card play in this game really doesn't seem to hold the same amount of tension as most I've played.

This game is a strange hybrid of euro mechanisms and consim sensibilities: area majority, worker placement, and airborne assaults on drug factories by elite Mountain Divisions.  




=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Game can potentially be really long (6 hours second game) due to the constant negotiation and discussion, necessary since everyone can attack anyone else. I typically don't like games that provide this much liberty, it is just too easy to attack a leader. I wanted to like the game but started to hate it three hours into my second 4p match. I think this is a game for those that like heavy diplomacy and negotiations, think Sword of Rome and Here I Stand for example. Now I'm hesitant about my P500 of Cuba Libre...

Update: Was convinced to play it a third time with three scoring rounds instead of four. Game is still long and chaotic. No longer willing to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
This is a very innovative game with a strong theme and deep gameplay. The asymmetrical factions and the way the card play is handled makes it a very dynamic, fluid and unique gaming experience. The fact that you can enjoy it whether you play solo or with 2, 3 or 4 players (with players added or leaving along the way) is a great bonus!

I have a love/hate(?) relationship with this game. On the one hand, the mechanics, historicity, components, rules and gameplay are attractive and appeal to my tastes. On the other hand, the bash the leader, the chaotic atmosphere, the length of the game for what it is and the question, does the better player usually win, are definitelty turn offs. 

Maybe it's the Euro gamer in me that wants good gameplay to payoff in a win or maybe it's that you need to be in a certain frame of mind when you are playing that I'm not getting right; the frame of mind being that it's more of an experience game. When played with that frame of mind, it is entertaining and fun; albeit a bit too long.

Anyways, there are some great mechanics employed, especially trying to be out of phase with your opponents with the events and the different twist in the area control aspect coupled with the engaging actions that can be taken on the beautiful and well illustrated map. There is a bash the leader aspect that sort of puts you in a position of not wanting to be in first place until it's time for a win.

Recommended, but if you have a chess player's mentality, it might not be your cup of tea.

Preliminary rating

I enjoyed our first experience. Didn't seem as bad as some other raters have written. 
I was really afraid of the time you take to build and how easy is to destroy your work. On the other hand I was playing with Government and I was the one destroying things. But there were so many things to destroy that I believe they were not as hard to build as "they" say. 
The game ended on the third propaganda card and it was very close. If I was unable to destroy one AUC base on the last card AUC had nailed it.
I ended with 61 Total Support and 0 (zero) resources :D
 
Need to play it again, soon.

Love this game!
I think this is the most innovative wargame system in the last 15 years and it makes it possible to explore all those non-conventional conflicts that have otherwise been hard to game at this scale.

The only (very small) downside to the game is a playtime that is slightly longer that what I would have preferred, and the subject of the game, which is of limited interest to me.

RATING: 8
A "card assisted" war game it claims, it's still card driven, but the cards are sequential from a deck not from players hands. It's a lop-sided affair, different size forces, different victory conditions for each of the 4 factions make it very clever. You need diplomacy and shifting alliances to work for the win. There's also a chunk of area control and a track round the edge of the board, so it's a euro, right? ;-)

Tentative rating - first playthrough didn't give me the sense of story that I wanted, but the design is brilliant.

Okay, after playing A Distant Plain opposed, I still
don't see much in story. It's too pulsed, and too much
relies on the cards for flavor. Moreover, it feels as though
the games are balanced (by the players) to a degree that
they will far too often come down to the luck of the final
draw or so. That's not to say there is no skill in keeping
the balance, but assuming players making a serious effort
to do so, it may well feel as though you're playing for hours,
only to be decided by who gets the bonus 'placement' 
before the final scoring draw.

Played this game a couple of times and I still feel like I'm only grasping half of what is going on. A fun and interesting experience. Having played this three times now, I think one has needs to play all four sides before truly figuring this bad boy out. If you doesn't understand how a power works, then it is easy to make a mistake and allow a power to sneak in a victory right before the Propaganda card is scored. I've manged to do that twice and have had it happen to me once. In other words, I'm looking forward to playing my next game and pealing back yet another level of strategy on this game. Love it.

RATING: 3
I have a review up now on my blog: http://illuminatinggames.blogspot.com/2013/03/andean-abyss.html

I'll probably move it here before too long.

---
TIP: Definitely play the short game (3 Propaganda cards) your first time out, and budget 4 hours. It should smooth out and come down with some experience, but it's totally bewildering the first time through and the only way to figure it out is to play it once without fear of screwing up, then play again if you like it. It's definitely a bit longer than it wants to be, but it's not terrible.

Anyway, I enjoyed this, although it was not quite what I expected it to be. It feels very euro-y. Nice thematic event cards, thematic actions and victory conditions, but at the end of the day it's an area control game with cubes and cylinders. That's fine, but I think I would have liked a bit more detail. It's not Labyrinth, it's actually simpler and plays a little cleaner, but the Labyrinth heritage is clearly there. While it won't be a 100% accurate predictor, letting your feelings for Labyrinth guide you here won't lead you to far astray.

Like Labyrinth, Andean Abyss does the player asymmetry really well. Each faction plays differently and is given narrative attention. There is something of a pro-Government bias in the game design, in that I think their position is thematically fleshed out better than the others, but it's not bad.

You'll know if you want to buy this, so, I'll instead provide a few reasons you might want to avoid it if you're on the fence:

1) I was a little surprised by how much "whack the leader" there was going on. Scores are open, everyone can more or less get at everyone else, you have to seize and hold your objectives, so a fair amount of time and effort is spent in hammering away at whoever is ahead. The AUC and Cartels, with their fairly straightforward and easy victory conditions, draw attention out of proportion with their real-life importance, at least compared to the FARC. Anyway, the game was less tactical and more "lie low and sneak in for the win" than I expected, or usually have any tolerance for. For me personally, the total package worked, but it's a risk going forward that will kill replayability for me.

2) Like Labyrinth, Andean Abyss is pretty heavily sanitized. This was (and is still) a brutal, anarchic conflict. Lip service is properly paid to the nastier bits as players take actions called "assassinate", "extort", "kidnap", and generally become narco-terrorists. But it's only skin deep. The crisp, clean, pleasing graphic design is at odds with what's really going on here. The scenic shots of Andean mountains and jungles on the cards is not the real story. I live for the art of games, and in this case, service of art seems to require making players slightly more uncomfortable.

3) Also like Labyrinth, this is a bit of a message game.  This is my opinion, and the designer is much more immersed in these issues than I ever will be, but still. Labyrinth was more or less right-wing fantasy (as was Twilight Struggle), and Andean Abyss doesn't feel that much different to me, it's just a topic we know much less about. Also, like Labyrinth, it trains all its thematic firepower on the finding and killing of insurgents while keeping the really crucial part (the actual politics) completely abstract. Yes, you have to find and kill insurgents. But that helps you not at all without functioning politics.

There you go. I enjoyed the game, much as I actually quite enjoyed Labyrinth, but there are bits of it I wish were better.

I have played this game twice. My opinion after the second game. I love this game quite a bit but it can drag on.  In my second game I met the win objective multiple times but it only maters at given points in the game. Aligning those stars can take forever.  I do not see how meeting the win condition in this way does not end the game.  I played for 5 hours and I think there could have been 3 more when Sadley I had to leave.

A very asymmetrical area control game with a rather cool card-driven engine. The fac that only two people get to act per card and, if they do, they need to sit out is pretty cool.

I'm curious to see if the rules fade quickly to the background on subsequent plays and, if so, does gameplay really emerge.

Very interesting game about insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia. Assymetric sides, diplomatic-heavy action selection, innovative card driven mechanics. Euro-elegance in design. Luck factor is unnoticed and has not significant impact on game flow. Game reward planning, useful alliancing and consequence in realisation of our goals/disturbing others. High learning curve but this is a big advantage. Can't wait until next games in series will be issued.

:tobacco: :) :) :) :D I believe that this will end up being a landmark in wargame-design history, or at least in the history of games that some people claim are wargames and other people claim are not wargames and then there's a long and tiresome argument about the matter. Ruhnke's previous designs were brilliant (Wilderness War is a fixture in my Top 10, and I believe that Labyrinth got more backlash than it deserved in part because people were set up to expect Twilight Struggle 2 and were disappointed when it wasn't that) but they worked in the framework of the GMT CDG Stylebook. Andean Abyss drops the Stylebook into the recycle bin and tries something new.

The way it works is surprisingly straightforward. There are four factions with partially-interlocking win conditions: FARC wants to knock down support for the government, the government wants to hold its strong urban support and re-establish control in the more lawless rural areas, AUC wants to build more bases than their FARC rivals, and the Cartels want to skulk about un-noticed and stack chips. Each turn reveals one card (and one card into the future) with an event and a draft-pick order of the four factions. The first eligible faction in that order gets the choice of operations or event, a la Every Damn CDG Ever. Ops are chosen from a Chinese menu of four options and can be executed in as many areas as you can afford. At that point, the second eligible faction gets a more limited choice, the exact limits depending on the first faction's choice. Once two factions have made their choices, the factions that acted this turn become ineligible to act on the next card. Lather, rinse, repeat.

This delay means that it's easy to set up a power move but it's virtually certain that the target of said power move will get a chance to slip the noose before it can be executed. This makes it [i]seem[/i] like Andean Abyss will end up being a very tactical game of short-term opportunism, or maybe just whack-a-mole writ large. There's a real problem with playing it that way -- you will almost certainly get crushed. Good players keep their eye on the win conditions and think operationally, only whacking those moles that absolutely, positively must be whacked.

I had a serious problem with the initial attempts at this game running grotesquely long. Some of that was rules knowledge but a lot of it was a combination of AP and a lack of look-ahead on players' parts. You can't tune out Andean Abyss when it's not your turn and expect that it will be a brief game. It's still pretty damn long but, like Dominant Species (a game it resembles in several non-trivial ways), Andean Abyss is capable of a wide range of play times.

That aside, it excels. It is a tasteful blend of wargame theme and more Euroified mechanics that nonetheless does not feel like a pure abstraction of the actual conflict. It's well-balanced and it rewards good strategy. For those willing to put in the time, the simple mechanics produce surprisingly interesting out-of-the box situational tactics you'll think on after the game is put away.

Brilliant system. I love the components but after awhile the board looks like office complexes and corporate development rather than a conflict. 

Very interested in the Colombian War. Would like to see even more expansion cards.

Lets not get into the argument if this is a wargame or not (because it is). The question is does it portray irregular warfare (and COIN operations) in a satisfactory manner. There is no doubt about this in my mind. There is no "military victory", it is about economics and public opinion (and in many ways this is what warfare is really about anyway).

I'm not sure if the sides are "even", the government player definitely needs to to have some XP with the game as they may have the toughest job balancing all the factions.

Wanted to really like this game. A subject I don't know much about.  The game is a 10 for production values, map, counters, info chits, historical flavor, all great. BUT for our group, found the game lacked a sense of panic when making decisions on what to do.  You basically have one item on your card to perform or use the event while looking forward to what you need to keep your opponents from getting a good card.  The sense was each player doing their own thing and hoping they would win the game.  The scores moved around and each player danced with a chance at victory but the other three knew they could stomp the leader at will. Each player seemed to playing their own little game alone. The panic we like is from Paths of Glory or Pursuit of Glory with each card being an agonizing decision, do you move or play the event or take critically needed reinforcements.  I am an old, really old, gamer and enjoy standard hex games, so that could be a problem.  Just needed a bit more tension with each time I had to play.  Loved the asymmetrical turns and the decisions to GO, PASS and what to do.  Think if there was one more critical decision it might have worked, such as reinforcements or free move.  
Saying all of the above, I still like the idea of the COIN series and have pre-ordered them all.  When the new games arrive will again trick my OLD WIF guys into playing the newest COIN game.  Davis

This is a fantastic game: the interactions between the factions are very subtle and the dynamics change a lot according to the order of events. The card mechanism is a very clever design - the agonising choices between acting on the current card or passing to act on the next are a fantastic feature.

A multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia: guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror. Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals. Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted. Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia—smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors. features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip. Most of the game’s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths: players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities. Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played. There is no hand management: the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable—and the unforeseeable. Die rolls are only a small part of game: the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.

Not even close to a wargame, a poorly designed euro-game at best.
Combat system is below Risk.
Map is ugly and it is difficult to read and make the game hard to follow.
History is nor portrayed _in_ the game, it is placed as an overlay with some Google images slapped on euro-style card effects. There is not causality, development, conflict logic... 
Gameplay was the worst, you have to manage what the game gives you with the cards, it is a very reactive/passive gameplay, not very strategic, not streamlined in mechanisms... nor interesting.

Only played once with four, but it was a fun experience. I like how each faction has it's own actions and win conditions. Lots of replayability in the order of events as well as the ability to play a different faction each time.

I thought I'd enjoy this one. 

I was wrong. Again. 

To be fair, my reasoning was sound: I liked Labyrinth a lot (although didn't actually 'enjoy' it in a sense of gratification), I like Volko's attitude and ethos, and it certainly sounded like a treatment of a much-ignored war. 

The war in Colombia dragged on for the best part of forty years and so, in most cases, do games of Abyss. There are certainly some startlingly original mechanics at work here, such as the variable turn order and action sequence, but these jewels are generally lost in a muddle of indifference. 

It is far, far too easy to simply gang up on the strongest player, turning it into an overcomplicated Risk. The random nature of the scoring cards also encourages 'camping-or-ganging' styles of play, making it impossible to build a coherent and cohesive strategy (unlike in, eg, TS with its set end date of ten turns). Equally, the actions open to each player do indeed reflect assymetry of power, but generally do little of real note, or to encourage a sense of immersion. 

Sorry Volko, but I think this one should have remained an academic exercise. It has certainly put me off the upcoming Cuba Libre and A Distant Plain releases.

This really has been a year for cack GMT releases, hasn't it!


*edit*

Played this again with a couple of friends the other day who'd bought it. I thought ASL was tedious, but not actually being invested in owning it anymore I see the mechanics for what they really are. Utter boredom and pointlessness results in anything less than a 4-player game, where analysis paralysis rules the day (and afternoon. And night). Ultimately this is a relatively bog-basic area control game drowned beneath a sea of underpowered actions and crippled by the boring asymmetry of the sides involved, each side having objectives and abilities that only marginally intersect. No action has any real effect, its counteraction has no real consequence and thus the game ends up a 6-hour 'gang on the leader' until the last propaganda card is (thankfully) drawn.

Sorry Volko :-(

Interesting subject and mechanics, but maybe too long for what it is. As such, anyone who manages to take the lead and be in a winning situation can easily be taken down by the other players, especially the Cartel with their Bribe ability.
Still, as stated above, this is a fascinating subject and a very hard game to play well. Simple to teach, hard to master and all that...

Another played down, this is growing on me. For me the game really realizes its theme. The action and prioritization decisions and negotiations i make are similar to those i read in COIN histories and i really enjoy this. I found shuffeling the last propoganda card into the last 5 cards rather than 15 makes the ending predictable enough to prepare for, but still random enough to avoid calculation. I also like how the four factions play very differently.

If it weren't for the theme, this would make a good family lighter war game imo. Mainly because theres no player elimination, all the players self balance to keep everyone in contention, and theres no really sharp back stabs, so no emotional betrayal.

-------------------

this game is sort of like 4 people trying to pull a tea towel in different directions, and then at a random point some one holds up a flag and the winner is decided.

I think it is a good game, it delivers the conflict and the kinds of decisions the various factions had to make (i've read some books on COIN stuff) in an easy to understand package. I played the game with two chicks that aren't in to heavy games.

However for all the things this game does really well (theme, four player area control, negotiation etc) it has one major downside for me. The game ends suddenly. Four (or three for a shorter game) scoring cards are included in the deck, shuffled in to 15 card sections randomly. When these cards come up you check for the winner. Only you only get one card notice of their arrival, so only two out of the four players can act on the knowledge that the scoring card is there. Timing is really crutial in this game as you wont maintain a lead for long before being brought back down. With this scoring system the end winner can be rather random.

Everything about this game is great except for the length (thus the 9 vs. 10 for being a bit too long; we have yet to finish a game).  I like the asymmetrical player abilities, that there is a ton of strategy and just enough luck to keep things interesting, that it is hard to run away with a game (if people play intelligently), the card event/action picking/ordering mechanics, and how well the theme fits.  I hope to play the solo version at some point, something I rarely do in other games.  I am not a huge war gamer, but the mix of Euro and war game has totally hooked me.  I pre-ordered Fire in the Lake because this was so cool.

I'm a former euro gamer, turned casual Magic player, turned hybrid gamer, and not you can add COIN games to my CV. Andean Abyss is engaging, interesting, thematic, and grandiose. Prepare for hard work when learning your first COIN game, but - as one user put it, "You get out of COIN games what you put into them." The longer I stick with AA, the more I like it. The Rulebook and Playbooks (totally more than 75 pages total) would seem intimidating, but they are fascinating and include history of the conflict, design decisions based on history, tutorials, etc. 

Four factions, each with a different victory condition, each with a different action-tree, each with different types of conflicts with the other factions, and a game system that includes "bots" (non-player algorithms) so that humans can step in and out of them game, and the game can still move forward. Or players can switch to another faction mid-game and hand-off to a bot! Fantastic system.

Technically my second COIN purchase, but my first played. This has been a fantastic gaming experience, and I think I might be all in for every COIN game.

I don't have enough of a grasp of this game yet to be able to rate it or record comments with much confidence. The rules aren't especially complicated, but they also aren't quite intuitive enough for me to remember without doing a thorough re-reading. I tried to muddle through two games without an understanding of the interphase, and that can really mess you up. 

Based on two plays, I can say the things I like are: good implementation of theme, interesting and seemingly well-balance asymmetry of powers, lots of flexibility and thus room for creativity in tactics. 

Primary concern: musical chairs-like nature of Propaganda rounds. The game can often go like this, "If a Prop card comes up now, AUC should win it. Ohhhhh, tough break for AUC! OK, now if a Prop card comes up, FARC should win it! Ohhhhh, you lucky bastard!"

Volume I of the popular COIN series simulating the insurgency of Colombia.  The 4 sides are represented by the Government, the FARC (marxists), AUC (right-wing militias) and the Cocaine Cartels each with their own asymmetrical starting positions, victory conditions and abilities.  Each turn, a card is flipped where only two factions can act based on the priority on the card.  Can be played solo as the Government only.

RATING: 7
A well designed, thematic, 4 player asymetrical wargame/eurogame hybrid.  Not exactly a CDG in the traditional sense, but the main tension in the game is card driven from a central deck that determines turn order and game events.  I think it is reasonably well polished, but does feel a bit plodding and long for what it is.  I know nothing about the conflict, so there is a little of a history lesson in this game as well.

I played a proto-type of this game at WBC. For a complete review of my experience with it, check our site "The Boardgaming Life."

Now, I’m far from an expert at Andean Abyss, but I’d say it is the most innovative Card Driven Game I’ve ever seen. But, it might be a bit abstract for old school wargamers. So if that doesn’t faze you, I’d recommend jumping right in. Just think of it as a cross between "Here I Stand" and "Labyrinth." 

In Andean Abyss 4 players vie for control of 1990’s Colombia. They run the forces of the central government, the Communist guerillas (FARC), the right wing militia (The AUC) and the drug cartels. Each has its own abilities, limitations, costs and victory conditions. Andean Abyss uses an area movement system and variously shaped blocks to represent factions, units and bases. And while there will be a winner, there will not be a player who sweeps all before him. 

Keep in mind that although each faction has rather long lists of operations they can performal, not everything can be done at once and during some turns nothing much can be done at all. This is not a "rebels versus the government" game, but a 4 way asymmetrical struggle where each side is for and against each other side, even within a single turn. In effect, players are juggling 5 or 6 balls in the air simultaneously and whoever drops the fewest will win. 

This is a remarkable game. After playing it more than a few times, I expect my rating to move up.

This confirms I am not a fan of the volko system. I like that there are 4 competing asymmetrical factions. I felt like I had little ability to create and execute a strategy, and that my success in the game had more to do with what other people were doing, and I didn't see how I could manipulate or convince them to play otherwise. At first I really liked how the cards are played despite not really enjoying the board mechanics at all. As the game progressed I disliked the cards too because the turn order is random on each card, and it is not uncommon for your plans to be totally demolished by turn order screwing you, which you really have little to no control over. I think I'm done with volko mechanics for a while. If you like Labyrinth you will probably like this one.

After 2 plays at WBC, I would say this is one great game. The 4 different factions with separate objectives and the topic itself is a winner in my book. I played and won as both the UAC and FARC so it seems that one side does not dominate. Both games the cartel came within inches of winning the game as well. The government player seemed to struggle a bit, so I am looking forward to see if perhaps they have the tougher role. All in all, kudos to Volko!

This is one of those games where I find myself contemplating my next move while I'm not even playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
In this game, decisions are severely restricted and significantly directed by a card driven initiative mechanism. Missing factions are played by different algorithms. The former is way too random for comfort (in one play the government faction played full operations ONCE against at least 7 FARC full operations before a premature end - with nothing to be done to counteract that bias), the latter is way too deterministic and also rather fiddly to execute (nothing is straightforward, each possibility has several dependencies and exceptional circumstances), which takes up loads of time. 

As a game, this is too cumbersome to be entertaining. It is also one of those simulations that make you go through the motions determined by the single card that is played. Yes, there are some decisions, and perhaps many of them are highly significant. But the manner in which the cards determine the range of those choices (extremely wide versus utterly limited) can make the game a really frustrating experience. 

All of that aside, if you play this game solo and see it simply as a simulation of how a recent political struggle of a government against a multitude of insurgents could have played out, then the way the mechanics draw you into the theme will astound you. I am extremely impressed by how the game develops.

After just two plays I dare to utter the suspicion that the game really hinges on two of the many event cards each of which reduces the cost of one of the two main actions by 2/3. If the government player is fortunate enough to receive these events early into the game, the task will be much, much easier (or perhaps become possible at all). If not, breaking the tide of the insurgent momentum might turn out to be way too costly in the long run. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Elegant dynamic for a CDG with the cards showing and shared.  All games played have been very tight, and the nail that sticks up tends to get beaten down quickly.  You really have to be nimble to win, having both timing and some luck can be real helpful.  The asymmetric conditions make it imperative to watch everyone's position.  A very engaging game.

Appreciate the atypical subject matter.  Was dimly aware of Columbia's trials, but you can learn a lot about our neighbor to the south just by reading the cards.  Really appreciate what the government accomplished there in bringing a big nation toward the light, and showing us how it could be done.

Liked being able to play by PBEM before the game even comes out.  Getting to test drive a product is fantastic.

Subsequently downgraded slightly (still a fine game) but find some of its successors to be still better.

RATING: 8
Andean Abyss is technically a war game, with a very mature outlook on war.  Most games depict war as little more than something people do with guns.  Andean Abyss is far more nuanced than that, representing not just combat, but also the way politics effect and often prolong these conflicts.

In this 3-4 hour game, four players play four different factions acting in Columbia during the 1990s.  Each faction has different abilities and different victory conditions.  The Government wants to restore stability to the region by winning back the support of the people from the communist FARC, who try to spread propaganda and establish bases in as much of the country as possible.  The AUC paramilitary group simply wants to have a stronger foothold in Columbia than the FARC, making their interests align with those of the Government at times, but make no mistake, they are not allies.  Finally, there are cartels who simply wish to expand as rapidly as possible.  They can bank roll any side they like, but no side should let their growth go unchecked.  The meager six bases they start out with grow quickly.

Gameplay centers around an event deck which represents which not only determines the initiative for each round, but also allows players in turn order to tip the outcome of an event from the time period in their favor.  The only problem is that taking advantage of an event takes up the players entire turn.  These events do a great job of disrupting plans and keeping every player on their toes, especially since opting not to trigger an event usually means not only forgoing a great opportunity, but sometimes even handing it over to an opponent who will use it to screw you over.

The game is complicated, to say the least.  It can also take up to four hours with a group of inexperienced players, making it an intimidating box to open, but I promise that it's worth it.  Not only is this a fascinating system, but also a convincing model for how insurgency works and why it is so difficult to deal with.  It is clear that designer knows a great deal about this topic and was careful to treat it with the utmost respect.

It would be a stretch call a game like this educational.  It represents rather than simulates.  It lets it players feel what it might be like to sort out such a conflict, but in order to teachable and playable in an evening, it does let some accuracy go. However, it does an excellent job of alerting the players to the complexity of the political climate in the Colombia in the 90s and will likely inspire some to learn more.

The bottom line is that it is a fascinating game which gives players an experience that few other war games can offer.

The activation sequencing is great; differentiating itself from the standard ops vs. events tension, but still manages some of the same virtues. It can, however, lead to odd swings of luck. The events are generally underpowered, though, so mostly you'll be doing OPs.
Any novel stuff is undermined, however, by how obtuse the game is. Once you strip away all the overly terse rules and the nested conditionals, what you have is an area-control game with near perfect information that degenerates into whack-the-leader the moment people finally stop wrestling with the rules long enough to realize what's going on.

RATING: N/A
Volko has managed to design a game that is all about TURN ORDER. Rather than being an important part of a game as it usually is, Turn Order is the central mechanic here. From there, other cool game elements are included: asymmetrical player actions, different victory conditions for each player, event/operations CDG, area control.

One quibble: Would have been nice if each faction had their own embossed symbols instead of just stars (Cartels have their own and they are the exception).

Excellent. Just enough randomness in the turn order/event timing. Long but I have felt constantly engaged. The differing victory conditions create constant temporary matching goals for different sides, always different tacit alliances popping up then falling apart. All sides seemed like they were in with a shot at victory at various points and the beat the leader structure of the game gives natural breathing room to someone who has fallen behind (I think this is the only time I have praised beat the leader as a game mechanic). A joy to play, so very different from anything I else I have played. Consequently the rulebook is difficult, as there is basically no familiar mechanics to hang your understanding of the game on - it is all new stuff, all written in terse, I'll only say this once wargamey language.

On P500 Pre-Order.(on 02-Dec-11)

Arrived (07-Sep-12)

I only played 1 4-player games FtF, but in this games doesn't seem to matter whether you play or not. 
Perhaps the scenery of this "war" was a chaotic as this game, but at least in the real deal the cartels for instance sustained their power long enough to build skyscrapers and drive fancy cars, where as in the game on you move on from a donkey to beat Mercedes, all others become jealous and gang up on you.

I would like to try again, perhaps solo, with playing the factions myself, cause finding 3 opponents will be near impossible.
Rating from 8.5 (out of the box), to 6 (after some contemplating and gaming)

Great day with friends. Negotiation, betrayal, surprise attack and stealthy victories. The theme is novel and the system works very well.

Hardline hex&counter wargamers may find it a little too euro-ish. But I think most will find the need to add at least one COIN game to their collections.

The Paramilitaries tend to win if the government aren't watching them closely enough.

I pre-ordered this game because
1) I'm a fan of heavy war, themed euros and 
2) I don't know anything about Colombian politics or factions.

I didn't expect the positive acclaim this game has received. I thought I'd be playing this one alone.

Great 4 player game with factions slightly dependent on each other. Great theme and great components. 

Solitaire play can be predicted after a few turns and learning the solitaire flowchart is a whole other challenge and the AI phase takes twice as long as my turn which gets kind of procedural and annoying after awhile.

Just another coin game.. they're basically all the same, just with a different theme.. the mechanics are exactly the same.
Bores the death out of me. Also it's really not intuitive.
You're pushing cubes around & watch how one colored cube kills a different colored cube. Battles are as exciting as leaflets about tax saving opportunities.

Instead he could've made a nice solid, brutal 4 player wargame.. well.. wishfull thinking. I guess the old grognards are the last to go euro aswell..

The first game in the now seemingly never ending COIN series. The presentation is superb, with so many wooden bits, this really is setting a new standard for wargames to follow. There are two weaknesses: the use of a multi-player format brings with it the usual problems of arbitrary attacks and leader bashing. Each player needs to carefully monitor the others and keep them in check, inattentiveness or vendettas simply create opportunities for others to win. The second problem really follows on from the first. With randomly distributed propaganda cards, no-one is likely to win without having an action on the immediately preceeding card and this introduces a substantial luck element. Overall I liked this game, but your fate is as much in the hands of others as it is in your own, a frustration that I don't normally enjoy and for that reason I think 2 player CDGs like Labyrinth are superior.

Wasn't crazy about it, but not ready to write if off. My main issue with the game was the meshing of theme and mechanics. The fact that the rules are meant as a game [i]system[/i] that can be generally applied to other conflicts leads to a little bit of over-abstraction - unlike in Dominant Species or VR's superior Labyrinth, the actions you take don't really [i]evoke[/i] the theme, and thus to me the game became an exercise in bean counting and cube manipulation.  The fact that I am completely ignorant of the subject matter probably did not help in this regard, which is why I am interested in trying Fire in the Lake to see if the abstraction is still a problem for me.

RATING: 5
The entry barrier is HIGH.   Thousand of different options for different factions with thousand of conditions and effects.  It obscures the correct assessment of the game at first.  You have to be well familiarized with the possibilities offered to play consciously, focus on the actual strategy and draw conclusions regarding fun and the final rating of the game. 

My conclusions after 3 plays (2 incomplete):

4-player tug of war game.  Fun at first (barring good knowledge of the rules of course), but tedious and futile in the long run.  The mechanics is not to be blamed - it's really fine.  The problem is rather the excessive length of the game combined with this tug of war feeling.
The result of this combination can also be described as a lack of excitement, tension and involvement after first 1-2 hours.

Recently I start to realize that I dislike multi-player conflict/war games - where much does not depend on you (or depends purely on your negotiation skills) and you are not involved all the time (->downtime).  When you combine those with the tug of war feeling and long playing time (and these _are_ the traits of Andean Abyss), it's even worse for me... :(

--

I LOVE the mechanism of eligibility/non-eligibility combined with the matrix of options for two eligible factions.  That's something truly new and refreshing.  Wow.

I bought Andean Abyss expecting a wargame based on the internal struggles of Columbia. What I got instead was an area-control Eurogame that plays much longer than it needs to. While I like how the card deck and active/passive player mechanics work, I found this game to be similar to Dominant Species, another game I dislike.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2013)

As Andean Abyss is based on historical events that took place in my country when I was already born (a child but still), I was keen on playing it. This game has polarized my gaming friends into two camps, the ones that would love to play the game (me included) and the ones that found the theme to be too hard to play it and enjoy it, surprisingly there are a lot of friends that refuse to play this based only on the theme alone as it is a sensitive spot for them and I understand completely.

As the game was explained to me, I begin to harbor a high expectation as the game seemed to be pretty fun, all the factions are asymmetrical and have different victory conditions, however they seem to be very well balanced, the card system is great and ensures each game is really different from each other and the way you choose and limit your opponents actions are brilliant. The historical events are fun to play (furthermore to us that lived some of them). The game has very good components and the map of my country is very well done.

Now to the bad side, I feel the game has a critical flaw that stop me from enjoy it. I feel it is mostly luck for a player to reach his victory condition. The problem is the way the propaganda card appear at random during the game (You can only win when a Propaganda Card appear). I will try to elaborate.

Let´s assume we are all competent players and know (more or less) what we are doing, as the game is so well balanced, no player can reach his victory condition and stay that way more than one turn BECAUSE all other players will attack him ASAP (fearing a propaganda card next turn) and bring him down again to a controllable level, this goes back and forth during all the game and (I confess) it is kind of fun, however as you never know when a Propaganda card will appear you never know when to time your push toward victory, if you push early you will get smacked down and if you push late you will have missed the window of opportunity. As it is so easy to attack the current leader, it doesn’t really matter how skillful you are in the game. No matter how good you are, you can´t stand a 3 way attack against you, so this brings me to my second complaint (although this is more personal).  I have found that I enjoy less and less games when the “bash the leader” mechanism is prominent and Andean Abyss is all about bash the current leader down. At least in El Grande, you already scored the points and the next scoring phase is known to you, In Andean Abyss if they attack you, you lose the Victory conditions you have achieved (this is way too easy)and you never know when the scoring phase is coming (Propaganda Card). Our most veteran Andean Abyss player told me that in most of his games, no player has been able to achieve his victory conditions, so they played until the very end and the player that was in a better position when the fourth propaganda card came won. Again as you never know when it is coming, it is totally random who wins.

Also as the way the game is designed, most of the turns (cards) will act only 2 players (more players can play if they passed the last turn), if only two players are active and ready to react when a Propaganda card appears, they are the lucky ones that can try to achieve they victory conditions this turn, but to me, that is an unfair advantage. 

Bottom line, the best you can achieve in this game, is to place yourself in a position when PERHAPS a propaganda card will appear and you take advantage of that, BUT as you never know when a Propaganda Card will appear it is mostly luck if you get it right or not. The problem is the random timing of the propaganda card.

The game can take a long time to play, this generally doesn’t bother me, but I don’t want to play a game this long when the winner is decided randomly by when a propaganda card appear.

I want (and will) play again to see if my observation is true or not, I really hope I’m wrong as this is a very good idea for a game and otherwise a great design.

By the way, my country name is COLOMBIA not COLUMBIA.

RATING: 9.5
This is not a normal board game. It is extremely unique and not any that i have personally experienced before. The game mechanic is slightly complex, especially to new players, but not too difficult to grasp. However, this is a game that requires massive amount of thinking and analysis effort, no joke. It's a really exciting and innovative game that's fast becoming my gaming group's latest favorite game. You have to play it and experience it before you can tell if you like it. It's a game with many possibilities and potentially lead to analysis paralysis if players are taking it too seriously. Also, it is a long game, easily one hour per player or it could be even more. Great theme, interesting game mechanic, challenging game play, high replayability, quality cards, bits and board, and extremely engaging. The only reason why it hasn't scored 10 is the play time...it's a long game when playing the full game, but players may always opt for the shorter version.

RATING: 9
The COIN system is a brilliant way of engaging players in the internal political strife of a given country. Most war games concern themselves with boots on the ground and subsequent tactics; the COIN series dares to ask the socio-economic, religious, ideological, and political questions driving the conflict. The nuts and bolts of these designs are equally incredible: an ingenious method of card-assisted play and turn order, menus of asymmetrical actions and goals, and a level of player interdependence rarely seen in games.

Andean Abyss is the series' first installment and still my favorite. More of a free-for-all than later iterations and perhaps a little more straight-forward in faction actions, relationships, and goals. There's just something about the setting, topic, and players involved that fascinates me.

RATING: 8
Solid game, the first of the COIN series that introduced a highly innovative system to card-driven wargames.  Deserves to be up their with Twilight Struggle as one of the more innovative card-driven games of all time, IMHO.  This game convinced me that Volko Ruhnke is a boardgame design genius.

Unfortunately, it hasn't hit the table as much as it would like.  Probably only four plays thus far, half of them with Volko doing the teaching/moderating.

Interesting game but clunky.  This was improved in future COIN series games.  A Distant Plain captured the same feel but with less fiddling of Lines of Communication.  

If you're looking into this game, know that will need 3 other players who will invest with you to learn the rules and, more importantly, the strategies and abilities of each faction.  If you can the game will shine.  Otherwise it probably won't see much table time.

I'm giving this an initial rating of "8". THIS is a game. Wow! Kind of puts a lot of others to shame, IMO. 4-players, each with different player powers and win conditions but everything is SO well-thought out and put together. Initially, I thought that the cards did not allow for any long-term strategic planning, but they don't seem to really destroy long-term planning, rather, they 'annoy' when things go against you. In general, I've found that if it's my eligible 1st turn, I'd much rather take Operations + Special Activities over some Event.

Anyways, once my group has really allowed the rules to set in over the next couple of plays I can see this game really starting to climb in my ratings and I'll be sure to update when it does; it's only a matter of time.

UPDATE: I've now played a few f2f games (once as the Cartel and once as AUC which I won!). This is a PHENOMENAL game. Everything feels so well thought out, so necessary and so frustratingly handicapping in that you never quite have enough resources or operations that you can do. Just awesome. We're going to play this again next week a few times to get a further feel for the game but now that we've got the mechanics down I can see so many different ways that this game could go.

Update (Sept.2013): Okay, I've played over 40 games of this over the past bunch of months. I'm giving this another bump (9.5). While I LOVE the card mechanic it does somehow seem to hinder real strategic planning. There are a ton of short and even longish term tactical play simply because you cannot have anyone get out too far ahead on any turn since that pesky Prop card could show up.

The Gov't Player needs to be the strongest player at the table by far. They really are the glue that holds a good game together. The person who can manage small resources effectively should be AUC and I do agree that they seem to be the hardest to win with even though I've done so on a few occasions. However, my personal favorite faction is the FARC. What's beautiful about this game is that for our gaming group, each faction loosely or strongly ties to one of our personality types. And while we've all played the various factions we've gravitated over the long-term to specific factions that we play over and over again.

I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to the next few COIN series games. I've definitely going to have to try them but this is just such an excellent embodiment of a game concerning the details of a rather murky and messy situation that is Columbian politics.

Played once with much coaching at WBC.  Learning the events, actions, and action combinations for one team (I played the cartels) was intense.  Learning them for all four teams, then seeing the interactive possibilities, seems like an amazing opportunity for a deep, infinitely replayable game.  I imagine that playing solo a few (8?) times is a path to educating yourself.  The one card for everyone mechanic was wonderful. I fear it will be a while, however, before this hits the table again.

GMT COIN (counter insurgencies) Game, card driven asymmetric area control, with different powers for each faction and variable win conditions.  Historically themed.  A good game, very long.

Reasonably complex rules to understand first time around, would be quicker in future.

After Action Report. Juego en solitario de Andean Abyss. La mecánica de este juego es no tradicional. Mientras el gobierno colombiano se afanaba en patrullar, y saturar todo el territorio de soldados para operaciones, las guerrillas del Farc hicieron lo mismo, Las AUC se fueron limitando en sus acciones y detrás de ellos los carteles de la droga fueron armando un imperio. Al momento de computar los puntos de victoria, el ejército quedó atrás por pocos, pero los carteles habían ganado cómodamente.... ¿Será demasiado realista este juego?

Very nice action selection mechanic in a great theme !

But gameplay is just a mess...
Do - Undo game, with asymmetric powers, boring, repetitive actions, little to no control, and with all information open is just that kind of game where playing good can actually hurt you...

Not my coup of tea... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My first COIN game. What I really enjoy about COIN is the asymmetrical factions, and the manner in which the factions take turns (two at a time), guided by the event card in play and the one showing for the following turn. It's such a wonderful, dynamic system with so much potential.

RATING: 9
The first game in the COIN (counterinsurgence) series by GMT. 

Other games in the series developed the theme in slightly different directions: Cuba Libre is smaller and shorter; A Distant Plain has 2 counter-insurgent factions; Fire in the Lake is almost 2 versus 2. But Andean Abyss is still my favorite. 

I love how the phases of the game, punctuated by elections, mirror the historical development of counter-insurgence in Colombia. The number of different moves available to each player, combined with randomness of the cards and the large number of areas on the board make up for a mind-boggling array of possibilities: no two games are ever the same.

Since I'm from Colombia... this game is somehow, pretty well understood by me.

I must say that this is a great design, pretty accurate. The designer took the proper time to understand the conflict and turn it into a great game: Fun to play, historically accurate and with great components.

RATING: 9
I never thought I would like this game, I had no interest in the subject matter and it has the Scarlet Letters 'CDG' associated with it.  But because of the good reviews and because it was on sale I got a copy and I'm glad I did.

I love the simple face-up card mechanism, and the two alternate outcomes for most events.  These mechanisms really bring out the best qualities of the card-driven genre and allow for great re-playability and terrific solitaire play.  

Can't wait for future additions to this series!

A lot of these card driven games are getting rather repetitive.  If you have Labyrinth, you don't really need to own this one.  I would play it again, just not blowing me away.  Might work better as a 4 player only.  2 player is kind of wonky.  I will play solo and perhaps revise my rating.

17-Dec-12: Got it on the table. Seems to have a long learning curve. Will work on it since it indeed looks promising: With just a so many rules it seems to be able to develop a high degree of dynamics and complexity. Each game a different one. Looks good.

05-Dec-12: It is on my cupboard, but up to now Labyrinth gets played whenever I have the time for a solitaire game. Eventually I will try this one. Looks really promising!

RATING: 7
Interesting asymmetrical card-driven wargame. Even though it's not so similar, Twilight Struggle is my nearest frame of reference as they are both CDGs from GMT.

The four factions play very differently and it would be interesting to try each of them. In my one play, I played the Government which seems quite powerful, but the AUC was virtually knocked out very early on which skewed the balance.

The short game only took 2 1/2 hours, not long at all. The long game would need to have a day set aside.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a good strategy game for four players. It is thematic, fun, innovative and interesting! The nice thing about this game is that it can be played with non-wargamers (yes, it is a bit abstract). I would not try this with less the four players though.

RATING: 9.5
Absolutely Great four (no more, no less) player game! The different victory conditions are forcing the players to negotiate, to form alliances and to backstab each other.

RATING: 7.9
Upon 2 plays, I can say that this game is quite fun and seems fairly well balanced.  The one exception is the Cartel player, so let the newest player play this faction.

A very solid game that should be added to any wargamer's collection.

RATING: 6
The game is obviously well designed and produced, but accessibility is not its strength. Here's a four-player game in which each player has his own victory goal and follows his own rules, and still, to have some hope of playing effectively, each player has to master not only his own ruleset, but also those of the other players. To say that the learning curve is steep, would be an understatement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My least favorite COIN game. The subject matter is of almost no interest to me, and the game-specific rules seems the most generic of the series (which is probably to be expected from the first entry). But it still can be interesting to play.

RATING: 9
The first and (in my read of the fandom) still most neglected of the excellent COIN series. This game is an outstanding introduction to a conflict with which most Americans have little to no familiarity (beyond the silly cliches of the "war on drugs" variety). This is a game I return to time and again for its thematic quality and genuine insights. COIN fans should give it more attention and plays.

RATING: 6
Based on one play: A card driven game where each players controls a different group in Columbia and each has their own goal. From the police to the guerrillas, you place troops and bases in order to gain control and stock up on resources. Each group has different actions they can perform and based on the current card your priority is indicated and up to two groups can perform an action. Once of those games you must play many times to get the hang of it. On first play it was hard to determine what was the best path to victory or where to focus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Four way drugs war in Colombia; the Government, right-wing paramilitaries, left-wing revolutionaries and cartels. The rules are seemingly simple (only eight pages) and each side has its own special abilities and as the COIN sytem is quite different to other games it takes some getting used to. The order of play is a bit random and there is no scope for long term strategy as you do what you can with what you have.

Provisional rating.

Interesting. A game that takes the subject of population-centric warfare and removes any modelling of population, largely glossing over the civil-political aspects to focus on the military elements. I feel this is missing the point in a very big way. What it leaves looks like a Euroish game of high ludicity but of limited value as a model of its subject. A disappointment. See Joe Miranda's Nicaragua game as a model for how this thing should be approached.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
As the Cartel, my main issue with this game was it took me several rounds to build up my bases and then the governments had the ability to remove them as a simple re-action without even entering the same city/dept. Perhaps I'm missing something but my impression was I spent a good portion of the game (hours) rebuilding what was repeatedly taken away from me. Where is the fun in that ? The only way for me to win was to get a lucky card draw right before the final scoring propaganda card was revealed. At least with other card driven games players can hold cards a few turns and time when they need to play them.

I hope I am wrong as there seems the be so much thought put into this design.

I would prefer playing this game solo. A solid 7 if you don't mind all the charts and flowcharts or if played as a 2 player game.

Das erste Spiel der von V. Ruhnke konzipierten „COIN“ („Counter Insurgency“)- Reihe. Szenario: das aktuelle Kolumbien, in dem vier Parteien/Spieler - die Regierung, die marxistischen Guerillas der FARC, die rechtsgerichtete, paramilitärische AUC und schließlich die Drogenkartelle - um die Macht kämpfen. Trotz des für Europäer mäßig interessanten Szenarios besticht das Spiel durch seine Mechanismen, die bei asymmetrischen Ausgangspositionen wie Siegbedingungen beginnen und über weitgehend unterschiedliche Aktionsmöglichkeiten bis hin zu einer höchst originellen Abwandlung des CDG-Prinzips reichen: Jede meiner Handlungen bestimmt die Handlungsoptionen der anderen – und sie beschränkt zugleich meine Möglichkeiten im unmittelbar folgenden Zug. Ein besonderer Vorzug des Spieles liegt in seiner herausragenden Solo-Spielbarkeit (und dies nicht allein dank einer gegenüber „Labyrinth“ deutlich leichter handhabbaren Flow Chart für die „A.I.“). Auch ein Spiel zu zweit wirkt keinesfalls aufgesetzt oder künstlich. Insgesamt scheint mir das Spiel ausgereifter und auch etwas spannender zu sein als „Labyrinth“.
Allerdings muss hinzugefügt werden, dass "Andean Abyss" recht fieselig werden kann, da das Spielbrett nicht sonderlich groß und recht bald von Würfelchen und Zylindern überbevölkert ist. Einige der Grenzen/Pipelines bzw. Straßen sind nicht gut zu erkennen - und ein Schubser gegen das Spielbrett kann die politische Landschaft unschön verändern.

First volume of the COIN series. Despite the fact that new volumes have introduced new twists on the gameplay and interaction of the factions, the game remains fresh and in the argument for best COIN series game.

Only played once.  I can only hope that we played it more wrong than forgetting to pull out the 12 unused cards.  I found this game to be almost unbelievably long.  And I don't believe the 12 cards being removed would have helped it much. We could have accomplished the same result in half the time or less.  Removing half of the deck for the set up may fix it.  Maybe.  

Whoever took the lead, the others piled on.  This game boiled down to the winner being the one who was fortunate enough to set himself up when the final propaganda card was revealed.  I spent the last hour or two of the game saying,"let's get this POS over."  Excruciating, despite the fact that I had a chance to win.  Just way too long for so few choices.

It's really an exercise in futility.  

Maybe that's the point.  Then again, maybe that shouldn't be made into a game.  

Way too many other better choices than this one.  Wow, what a long day.  Thank God I didn't buy this one.  Sorry GMT.  I really like loads of your games, but this one isn't one of them.

--Oct2012-- Very very long (with fairly substantial periods of dead time:  this isn't a game where one can play very far ahead.  Because the individual "turns" more-than-occasionally take a pretty significant amount of of time, there's lots of opportunity to enjoy the proceedings.)   On the cosmic scale between an every-decision-is-significant game (perhaps like the 18xx) and a thematic experience (like Tales of the Arabian Nights) this - at least subjectively - falls closer to the latter than the former.  Here one is at the mercy of the card order and the placement of the Propaganda cards.  A different card order; modestly different tempo; and the game comes out quite differently.  But is likely equally entertaining.  (Rating renders enthusiasm for the game, less a penalty for the 11 hour duration of the first play.)

RATING: 8
The first piece of work on the COIN series. This one is about the Colombia insurgency. We just simply called it 'drug dealers'. Through playing this game we can learn a lot of what's happening in those eras. The author made massive studies upon this issue. It's always great to learn something while playing a very enjoyable game. The player capacities (1-4 players) are also very favorable. However the FARC appears to be the most challenging side to play with.

It really felt like the game didn't work.  I was very hard to move your position forward and very easy to knock anyone else down so everytime someone would get ahead they would get knocked down.  It was a constant back and forth with the winner mostly as luck.

RATING: 5
Came in a close second with the AUC.

I adore the mechanic of reacting to the two cards that come down the pike, a bit how I solo CDGs anyway. The player aid cards make the game playable (and are a model many games could make use of), and the confusing rulebook is only used for clarification after taking in its basic concepts. 

As with most multiplayer wargames with perfect information, it is a sneak in for the win kind of situation if all players are about equal in skill. The full game is also long, but doesn't seem to drag.  

I'm looking forward to playing Cuba Libre now, since it's a shorter version of this. If I do play AA again, I'll be trying a new strategy or two and seeing how variable they might be.

RATING: 7
There's a good game in here, but I find keeping the four asymmetrical rules in my head to be a bit of a headache. I prefer the Cuba Libre subject matter and find it a little easier to comprehend. An interesting system that will go far in many historical settings. Looking forward to more.

Really wanted to like this but I found the novelty of not having a hand of cards while cool leads to a lack of an ability to plan. While this might work for some and some may claim it is thematic it just doesn't match what I like in conflict gaming. Also who comes out on top seems to revolve around when the propaganda card is drawn rather than how well players have played. Might work better as a 2 player.

I have played the game solo, 2 player and 4 player.  I really like the solo version although it takes some getting used to the algorithms and the game is long.   Both the 2 and 4 player games were enjoyable for me.  My gaming partners haven't warmed to this game though.  They struggle with the randomness and the minor role of the AUC in the 4 player game.  I prefer Cuba Libre because it is more accessible in terms of size and player time, especially in solo mode.

Played only once but that's really enough.

Players seem to do the same thing over and over. Also, there are some victory conditions that directly depend on the good will or the mood of other players and that's something I simply don't tolerate in a good design as this one could have been (again, this is my personal opinion).
The main mechanic is very innovative and very good, I must say.

Have you ever started watching a motion picture thinking it's not going to be to your liking, and then when the film is over you are simply awestruck?

One of the best Playbooks every published. The only thing missing in the box is a shorter scenario.

Plays solo just fine without the programmed AI (which I have yet to try as I am fully absorbed with the standard game already), especially when learning as there are so many intriguing things here.

2-player ftf is excellent (again, without AI yet).

Very creative, multi-layered, and fun game that brings an obscure topic alive.

Has motivated me to research the Colombian Conflict, a fascinating yet tragic chapter in human history.

Besides launching the COIN series, AA has the potential to be a landmark design, it's that good.

Love the COIN series.  Absolutely love it.  It successfully encompasses a difficult to simulate conflict in history.  Have you ever heard of a game that portrays the Columbian Wars of the past 30 years?  Probably not outside of this game.  However, it makes the conflict accessible to the wargame community in a quick and deeply strategic manner.  My group can get through the full game in 2-3 hours and that time is always tense, nail-biting, and an absolute blast.

Fantastic multi-player card-driven area control game set in 1990s Colombia. The factions (Government, FARC, AUC, Cartels) are asymmetrical in the way they play and what they need to achieve in order to be victorious e.g. the government needs to gain a certain amount of political control whereas AUC need to have placed more bases on the board than FARC. Designer Volko Ruhnke has introduced an interesting form of card-driving mechanism whereby cards are revealed and two factions have a choice on how they are played (for operations or events) and the decisions they make have a knock on effect on how their opponents can play. This aspect of the game feels innovative and requires the player to make numerous strategic choices. The balance of play is near perfect as each side tries to meet their winning criteria whilst simultaneously attempting to prevent their opponents from achieving their's and this keeps the game very close and tense. 'Andean Abyss' has taken its place in the evolution of CDGs and should be played by anyone who's serious about gaming.

This is my most recent wargaming campaign. I feel that there is a LOT here. The rules are quite simple (12 pages - I think), but it appears to be difficult to master the tactics. While not exactly a Card Driven Game, the COIN system requires the player to memorize quite a bit of operations and special activities. My impression is that I will enjoy this game the more I play. It contains a very interesting solitaire option as well.

RATING: 7
A game that was totally overwhelming to play during the first session. But what a great concept! 4 parties involved, each with their own goals, but within these goals there are similarities to other parties. Which means you will have to make more or less official alliances and then break them again. But as I said, overviewing this game during a first session seems hopeless. Another great mechanism is the different actions-part for each party, but it makes it even more confusing. "What does that action allow you to do again?" Prepare for a very long session. It's not verly likely I will play it anytime soon, but I would defintely like to in order to learn more about the asymmetry of the game.

I would rate this higher but for the fact that it takes a few plays to really get into the swing of things.  Unless a player is really into the subject, or very familiar with somewhat similar designs (and there aren't many) then their first plays are going to be painful, especially given the length.  I really wish I had three friends who loved this game as much as I do.  Thankfully, the solitaire system is quite robust and provides an excellent challenge.

Heavily asymmetric Euro-influenced wargame with great production values and excellent designer's notes. Rules are not complex, but the gameplay is quite involved as each side plays very differently so it takes some getting used to. The game covers an area that I have little familiarity with, and I've enjoyed learning a fair bit about recent Colombian history, politics, and geography through playing it. The Solitaire AI, although clunky, is a bonus. Initial rating of 8, but wouldn't be surprised if this increases with further plays.

I tried the game a few times but eh, it is just not doing it for me. Not a bad game and I can see some of the merits of its CDG system but at the same time, I find it really weird that, because this faction is doing this, that one cannot do it... Feels too arbitrary to my taste...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
After six plays.

A creative & impassioned design. 

There are extensive designer notes that help you quickly grok what your situation is and some of the unique tools you have to exploit the parasitical relationships the game models and rewards. 

To catalog a few things:

- The card handling aspect: no hand management here, nor Euro-style positioning for turn order, nor deck manipulation, which are abstractions that [i]become the game[/i] rather than the subject being modeled. But what the cards do is bring an varied juxtaposition of events & opportunities & burdens that are injected into the players world. They also provide a shared mechanism of choice (event or take action or pass) that is elevated by context and influencing player behavior, as well as turn-order variability balanced to the card effect. You also get a look ahead at the next card that will come into play to form a near-term strategy. 

It sounds complicated, but it isn't, it's organic & it works. It also makes the choices that arise, and many core aspects of the narrative, many in potentials based on the one and only shuffle of the deck at the start. And I love how this mechanic breaks away from the very concept of 'a turn,' making the game a continuous flow of decisions, tempo shifts, consequences, and struggle. In effect, this mechanism manages the tempo and enacts changing turn-order meaningfully without over-taxing the player, so the game can carry more meat. Anyone with an interest in design must see this mechanic at work. The designer took on a huge development burden to make it happen. The bang for the buck in intellectual work in this game is huge.

- The narrative is so rich it's just over the top. Playing this is an experience. The detailed textures are more granular than TS or 1989, the actions and dynamics are very specific. It shares with both those games that sort of deep, thematic richness and respect.

- You get to have your cake and eat it too; by this, the design brings so many strengths cards bring to games but the focus, always, is on board development. This is a [i]board[/i]game. The map is alive - with information, with change, with projection of power and opportunity - and the way so much complexity is simplified & readable is a terrific graphic design accomplishment. The maturity isn't only in the graphic design, but in the balance of constraints & sudden action every player has, in terms of the complex abstracted rules, to effect the board. Mature in that I don't feel the runaway churn of, say, Dominant Species; more like it invites you into deeper depths, managing to make an incredible amount of information in a total state of change seeable and paced for legibility. It's simply a wonder, the [i]thingness[/i] of the highly complex interactions and abstractions played out. This is conceptual design of a high order.

- The asymmetry of the factions is stark & dramatic. This asymmetry doesn't arise from player choice (like Brass, etc that create asymmetry out of player choice & interdependent economies), but is emphatically carved - in the extreme - in the available actions, resources, economies, victory conditions, and player piece counts & representations. And it works. Ideas seeded the game, but man alot of hard work went into it. This is no kickstarter pipe dream. This is inspiration & disciplined development. It deserves to be a system.

- Highly, highly interactive. Total enmeshment. Conditional alliances & such are clearly seeable and the game is designed to foster this in overt and subtle forms.

- The historical modeling is fascinating. The economies involved are asynchronous too and are as vital and suddenly elastic as the territory control fought on the map. The differences in scale the game models (bribing individual units to large infusions of foreign aide) work together brilliantly.

The solo ability is through the roof - the bots are brilliant, creating a challenging & surprising tableau to surf. It's a long game, one to plan ahead for rather than pulling it out at a gameday. Though one really must be able to leave it out on the table rather than packing & unpacking it.

RATING: 8
Very good game. Takes a couple of plays to learn. I have only played two solitaire games so far. I feel there is a lot of depth here. COIN series is on the brink of becoming one of my favourite gaming systems. I'm rating it 8 since I only played it solo twice. Further game play will probably increase rating.

The play aids for solitaire gaming is a Little clunky. There's a lot of switching back and forth as I'm new to the game. 
For example:
Some option says "max 3" some doesn't mention any max number. It takes time doucle checking the rules if there is a limit in the latter case.

The components are great, the subject matter interesting, the solitaire rules work well, the four factions feel different and varied. But most importantly? They give you actual bags to properly store your stuff! Rarely do I encounter this in board games now and days.

In all seriousness, this is a fantastic game. Having an understanding, if not appreciation, of the subject matter will bolster your experience, but even if you know nothing about the Colombian insurgency, it's still a blast to play!

A great design - that scales nicely from 1 to 4 (not I have only played solo - both trying to win with each faction and with the bots).

The Asymmetric win conditions and actions lent much to the theme.

Finally, a conflict that I knew very little about - so was great to learn.  I definitely see this one getting to the table quite often.

Being that I'm from Colombia, the theme was obviously a big selling point. But theme can only go so far. What really impresses me about this game is the clever action mechanic, which has a compelling phasing aspect and induces wonderful amounts of tension with the events. My only concern at this point is whether there is too much of a bash the leader element, where any player in contention for the win gets smacked down. UPDATE: my friends played again recently (I was at another table) and experienced precisely this issue. I'm still looking to get in another play myself but am already tempering my initially high expectations for this game. For a game that's not short and has a nontrivial amount of downtime, the bash the leader dynamic could just be too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It is exceedingly long, and most of the time frustrating since all the advances that you make on the board can be easily undone by the other three factions. BUT, the system of inter-play dynamics between the players, and the frigging awesome card management system are so brilliant that all these flaws are almost forgotten. As a game, maybe it deserves a 6, but as a game system (and I have very high hopes for the continuation of the COIN series) it deserves at least an 8. So I'll just average.

RATING: 9.5
Magnificent start for the Coin series. A very well balanced "event-driven" (is that a new term OoO) game, that is easy to learn and apparently rather hard to master.  Double thumbs up for managing to balance the game with assymetrical forces and victory conditions. 

Deeply entertaining and highly recommended. Not sure yet if the experience is that good with less than four players.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] The game that kicked off the COIN series. When I first got this to the table I had already played Cuba Libre and A Distant Plain, so it was very nice to just skim through the rules and start playing against the bots. I almost exclusively play the COIN games against the bots and I'm loving every minute of it. Updated bots from C3i #28.

RATING: 6
One play with all first-timers.  We decided after about four hours and two propaganda cards that we would only play through three propaganda cards (rather than four).  We finished the third propaganda card at five hours.  It was slow going, not because anything was particularly complicated, but because the situation is so wide open, the cards have to be analyzed as they arrive, and we had to learn how best to use each of our factions' unique abilities.  

Man, is this a fun game.  One of the players called it a wrestling match, and I think that is a great description.  Each faction is trying to achieve its own unique victory condition, but each of those victory conditions tugs on one or more other factions victory conditions.  So, the identity of your primary opponent can shift as the game moves along even though there is a natural tension between government and FARC as well as AUC and FARC.  There's also a necessary bash the leader component that seems to mean that good play will result in the game making it through all four propaganda cards.  The game has just the right amount of too many things to do and not enough actions to do them all---tough enough to be engaging, but not so tough that all you're doing is surviving.  

We all made mistakes, although few or no rules mistakes, and I think we all enjoyed the game and will play faster and better next time.  I gave this an initial rating of 8 with the strong expectation that it will go up.

Great first volume in Volko's Coin series. For a rookie war gamer this plays great.

Rules are a little on the condensed side, a lot of bullet points, but after a few plays it clicks, and interaction is great.

Highly intriguing design. The tutorial in the Playbook was very interesting, but I really wish it had been a complete game, and that it didn't end after just the 1st of 4 Propaganda cards.

I completed the tutorial in solitaire fashion, and loved it. This is one delicately balanced and highly captivating game. I love the theme, and it's such an asynchronous battle. You cannot concentrate all your firepower on one opponent, because this creates a power vacuum for another faction to expand, and believe me, you can expand very quickly in this game.

I would love to delve into this with some actual multi-player games, but even as a solitaire game only it will definitely stay in my collection.

I love guerrilla warfare, political, and card games and this is one awesome combination.  I also like asymmetrical games.  It's hard to balance two different forces, but to do this with 4 different forces is very impressive.  Each faction has different victory conditions and plays very differently.  The games are tense and each faction has had a shot at meeting its victory conditions.  So far, I have played 3 games (each time with 4 active factions, no non-player ones).  Each game has been better than the previous.

The quality of the components is top notch all around.  The playbook is one of the best I have seen and the tutorial is excellent.

I'm greatly looking forward to the other games in this series.

I can't imagine a richer and more intriguing setting and theme for a political wargame. Gameplay creates a unique story, an alternative history of stuff that actually went down. Before seeing it in action, I hated the idea of missing Hand Management, but the Card Drafting mechanic of COIN is simply brilliant. This is the best effort of multiplayer wargame with Variable Player Powers and unique victory conditions I have seen. Some factions are natural allies, some not so much, but their goals are never completely compatible or diametrically opposite. Every decision in the chaotic insurgency/counterinsurgency situation takes all the brainpower a player has in this easy to learn but difficult to win epic system.

Superseded by CL now IMO. Great initial game but I find Govt just too hard to win with and AUC too small a role to bother (despite  having one of the best win chances).

Will rate after more games. 
First one did not leave a good impression. 
Did not like that there is no interaction between turns and it leads to lengthy downtime (at least for beginners). 

Also... just like multi-player wargames, leads to all-against-one scenarios (personal dislike). 
Will wait for a second (more fluent) game to give my rating. 

Also I consider the rules and card texts very unclear. We had lots of argument about the interpretation of the rules.

Excellent historical game about Colombia. The rules and structure of the game is actually pretty easy to learn. What is hard are the different actions or operations that you can do. You'll need to experience how they work out before you get the hang of the game's strategy. 
The balance of the game is spot on. The many interactions between the factions are brilliantly done and provide a lot of strategies. It's really a game in which you need to influence, tricking, paying,etc the other players to do the actions that also benefit you.
The coin system does away with randomly dealt hands of CDG systems although there is still randomness. This is you can get chains of events for one faction, causing them to skip operations or bite the bullet. 
It's also a great solo game.

The original hurts my head a little bit.  This one really hurt me.  Too many things to think about.  More than a few new rules, and the different ways Jack hides and escapes was rough to remember.  Not a bad game, though...I just haven't played out the other yet.

Okay, I find this a lot better than the standard Mr. Jack. There don't seem to be quite as many balance issues and the development of the city makes the environment alternately more hospitable and hostile for Jack or the detective. More interesting characters, though also ones that are somewhat less gamebreaking than the Inspector from the first game (and fewer outright wimpy characters) and it's reasonably nice that they pulled the snitch mechanism out of a single character.

Still, what bothers me most is that there's the obvious elements of luck. I don't mind luck, but it bothers me when luck dominates. Yeah, if the detective accuses Jack on a "50-50" call, it probably wasn't purely 50-50 (due to hints in Jack's play). Bigger for me is the card flop on the odd rounds (when any one character's showing is a 50% chance) which I've seen often enough being the difference in an escape or not. Of course, both players are going to try to plan for any flop of cards, but this is a significant swingy element.

RATING: 8
I played the original Mr Jack only once and was impressed by the elements of deduction, touches of abstract strategy and the gorgeous artwork.  That choice of two characters from four, weighing up their abilities to move and use special powers - and what your opponent might do with them - is really interesting.  However, it did seem poorly balanced.  

Mr Jack in New York keeps all the positives from the original and, on early acquaintance, appears more evenly balanced.

RATING: 7
Much more open than the original, this makes it much more difficult to predict what can happen. So with all but expert players, this makes it seem much more random. I prefer the original, so traded away.

I like good deduction games, which this is.  It's limited in the sense that it's only for two players, but it does what it's intended to do well.  I like the "tactical" effects the New York iteration provides.  I'm not sure why it's listed for ages 14+ (this is misleading and surely only hurts the game's sales); my daughter, who is much younger than that, is able to play it (and properly).

Good challenging game of deduction. Not as engaging as I would have liked, and may be a little difficult to juggle all the various characters' abilities on top of all that.

Far trickier and demanding than it first appears. Impossible to play well without concentrating and looking ahead, which makes it chess-like and, contrary to my  first impression, a serious game. Luckily, it is not as complex or serious as chess. Easier to play detective, and I'd think he wins 55-60% of the time.

Some things remaing equal to the original "Mr.Jack" game, namely, the same gameplay, 8 turns and 8 characters, but strategy changes a lot, now you have lots of open spaces, and locations on which characters are always invisible, such as the parks and Liberty Island.
You have to deal with a lot of open spaces in the beginning, but as the game progresses changes in the game board may force you to change the whole strategy. Takes more time to master than "Mr.Jack". It's more brain burner than Mr. Jack as it offers many possible strategies.
It seems that the Jack player has more chances of escaping and winning this time, and now any character can gain an alibi card just by visiting on the game board a pseudo-character - 'the informant'.
I'm not sure if I like the fact that characters are always invisible in the liberty statue and on parks, this way it's very easy for the inspector, once he has a clue of whom might Mr.Jack be, or just by PLAIN LUCK, to put him on one of this places and discovering very easily his identity - supose: In a even turn(2,4,6), everyone is in light, Mr.jack plays a character on to the light and inspector moves 2 characters, that by chance include moving Mr.jack onto a park, then Mr.jack plays the last character more often than not, the only option is simply just putting that character invisible, but this eliminates everyone except those 2 characters - it seems that it's too much left to luck. Luckily that doesn't happen very often.
I still have to play a few more times to get it. It's a more complex version of "Mr.Jack". Very tricky. AP is huge in this game.
The art work is excelent and add to the quality of the game.

The original Mr. Jack has more theme to it, this one feels more mathematical, much more complex but the theme doesn't shine as much, but it's more balanced than Mr.Jack original game.

Sokkal dinamikusabb a Londonos Mr. Jack-nél, folyamatosan változik a terep, 3 szereplő pakolja fel az elemeket, 3 másik szereplő módosítja és átpakolja a tereptárgyakat, és csak 2 egyéb képességű ember van. Teljesen más a két pálya, ha választanom kellene, erre mondanám, hogy jobb (és nehezebb), de egyelőre mindkét pályát megtartjuk, fő a változatosság! 
Az informátor sokkal elegánsabb megoldás, mint a Londonosban a Sherlock.

More Mr. Jack with a bit more complexity. Some of the magic of Mr. Jack's simplicity is gone, but there's room for a bit more cleverness here, which has the corollary of a session being easier to win or lose based on how carefully you analyze what's going on with the board.

Definitely feels like the hardest Mr. Jack to figure out.  General consensus is it's more balanced than the original, but after 7 plays, I don't think I'm good enough to have an opinion.  All I can say is I really like it.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My first play was merely OK - it was interesting to see how the game worked, and there were plenty of interesting decisions.  But the game, overall, wasn't very fun.  I'm still trying to figure out why - maybe just not my kind of game?  

The mechanics of the game are very well done - minimal rules and moving parts resulting in a lot of interesting decisions and strategies.  And maybe a part of my disinterest is that I just haven't really gotten my head around everything that can be done.  I will probably play at least once or twice more before giving up on it.  

This game feels tactical, but I think it actually has a lot of strategy in it.  How you use the odd turns to set up the evens is crucial to your success.  How you segregate the innocents from the suspects, and manipulate visibility from turn to turn is also critical.  

I liked the way the characters are drawn - 4 are drawn randomly on odd turns, and the remaining 4 are available on even turns.  That encourages players to plan in 2 turn chunks, and is the heart of the strategic portion of the game.  I liked the challenge of manipulating Jack's visibility to match all the other suspects.

Simple, very easy deduction game. A little too simple IMO: the detective discovers Jack within three turns and then the game quickly devolves into a lame chase.

[u]December 09:[/u] I traded Mr Jack away because of the balance issue which killed the game for us even though we liked the design. It seems after 4 plays that Mr Jack in NY is a much more balanced game and as a result I must say I like much more. There are more stuff to do here which might lead to more AP but this is fine with me as I really like the concept behind the game. For the moment, I feel like this is a strictly superior version to the original Mr Jack.

I ended up trading it away too as I feel like Dungeon Twister scratches the same kind of itch for me as a puzzley chess-like experience but I prefer the latter.

Hmm. I’m feeling a little ambivalent about Mr. Jack (both the base game and in NY). I want to love these games, but the reality is that I just don’t. I’m not sure what it is, but the games don’t work for me as the deduction games I want them to be! I guess there is a little too much luck/little deduction for me to really appreciate the gameplay. The components are great etc., but that’s not why I buy and play a game! Now, I’ve only played this edition once (had planned to play it at least twice, but something got in the way), but I have played the original Mr. Jack three times and have made up my mind about this game. On its own merits I guess it’s a decent game, and I think that Mr. Jack in New York slightly improves on some things which didn’t work so well in the base game. The detective and Mr. Jack are more evenly matched in this edition, and the characters’ abilities are, to me, more interesting and varied. The informant and where the ferries are placed and the parks where you can hide are good ideas, but for me personally it’s not a great game. It’s still decent, though, as my rating shows, and I would like to play it again a couple of times just to be sure that I’m not missing anything as I really do want to love it!

Por ahora es mi juego preferido para dos jugadores exclusivamente. Excelentes componentes, magnifico sistema de juego. Mejora enormemente a Mr. Jack que me parecía muy estático y desequilibrado a favor del investigador. En este juego las posibilidades de ganar se igualan en ambos bandos pues Jack puede escaparse por muchos más sitios. Es divertido jugar tanto con el investigador como con Mr Jack (en el otro era más divertido jugar con Mr Jack) y además el tablero es muy dinámico pues se van añadiendo edificios, farolas, metros, jardines, etc. que le dan mucha profundidad táctica. En fin muy recomendable. El antiguo Mr. Jack lo vendí a las cinco partidas este ha venido para quedarse. Otra cosa muy positiva es que es apto para todos los públicos y de los juegos con mecánica de deducción que he jugado este es el mejor con diferencia.

This is a great improvement from the original Mr. Jack. The rules and abilities make the game a little more complex, but not overly so. It also introduces an enormous amount of diversity in how the board can form and change throughout the game and balances a lot of what wasn't as balanced in Mr. Jack. With this copy, I don't feel a need to have Mr. Jack as well.

RATING: 7.5
Despite what everybody's saying, this is really just an expansion of the basic game. Yes there is new terrain, and new characters, but the game plays with the same mechanics, the victory condition is the same, and the basic rules are the same. I also don't subscribe to the view that one should play the original first. It doesn't matter, since they are similar games, and I don't think NY is that more complicated.  However, both games are really very good and pretty special.  So, it is definitely worthwhile owning both, for the variety's sake while playing this exquisite game (system).

Solid two player deduction and movement game.  Eight characters move over a cartoon style game board depicting New York in the 1890's.  One of the characters is the notorious Mr. Jack, known to the Jack player.  The other player is trying to deduce who Mr. Jack is, and nail him by moving another character to his position to accuse him to win the game.  If Jack can survive eight turns, or move Mr. Jack off the game board - he wins.  Nice simple rules, spiced up by each character having a special power.  First half of the game is deduction (which isn't that hard) and the second half is all about movement and position.   Very similar to the parent game, Mr Jack, so unless you're a rabid fan, probably no need to own both.  This version seems a bit more dynamic, and probably easier on the Jack player which improves the balance.

At a higher level, it's no different from the original game.   Zoomed in, however, everything is different.  All new characters, actions, and map.  It still has that deep-thinking, chess-like play which makes it shine.  Essential game for Mr. Jack die-hards.   It's harder and more advanced (at least initially) than the original.   If you are only "so-so" on the original, then this won't change your mind.  I'm always happy to play this.

Every bit as fun as the original Mr Jack but with the added layer of being able to build the board as you play. That's fun, but that also makes it a bit more opaque and harder to play. I still love the Mr Jack series though and hope to see more.

[1 play] This was fine, but didn't seem to add that much to Mr. Jack--at least, not that much that I valued.  And thematically, the game is weakened by taking it out of London.  However, Mr. Jack has never been that thematic a treatment anyway (certainly not compared to, say, Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper).  And Mr. Jack in NY does have one big thematic plus, which is the use of real period characters and the inclusion of interesting info about them.  I thought that part was pretty cool.  

Really I suspect that my lukewarm reaction to the NY version was because I've only played the original fewer than 10 times.  I can pretty well imagine that to someone who had put in a lot of play of Mr. Jack, the NY version might offer interesting new ground to explore.

Első két játékra nem igazán sikerült megfejteni, hogy mennyi van benne. Értelmetlennek tűnt a karakterek fele, mert nem igazán lehet tudni, hogy nem pont az ellenfélnek kedvezel-e pl. egy lámpás lerakásával, tekintve, hogy abban a körben nem nagyon tudod használni, hiszen nem rakhatod ember alá. 
Simán lehet, hogy több van benne, mint amit elsőre éreztünk, kérdés, hogy lesz-e még lehetőség ennek megmutatkozni.

Not a brilliant game but definitely elegant, quick and beautifully illustrated. The theme fits the mechanics perfectly and my overall impression is very good (I haven't yet played such an immersive game).

I don't rate it higher because not all the rules are intuitive and the luck may make the winner. But I will play it often for certain.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wow, this is even better than the original Mr. Jack!

The more open, more dynamic New York board allows for more creativity and trickery and outwitting.  There is more opportunity to bluff and to try bold moves.  The decision tree is broader in New York, which may sound like it would slow the game down too much.  But I find that in New York, I'm less tempted to try to grind out all the logic of "if I choose this character and go here, then he can do this and then this."  There's realistically no way I can anticipate all the possible moves in a reasonable amount of time, so I'm more willing to settle for a "yeah, I [i]think[/i] think this might work out" type of move.

All of the small flaws of the original Mr. Jack have been addressed. Too hard for Jack to escape if the inspector is careful?  Now it's a very real threat. Balance slightly favors the inspector?  Nope, now it's even. Goodley so powerful that you're almost forced to choose him first?  There's no one like that in New York.  Need to hide the alibi cards behind the box because the color is visible along the bottom?  Not in this version.  Board feels too static?  Now you can create and change the terrain as you play.

This is the game Mr Jack should have begun with. 
I actually enjoyed myself playing it. Thus I give it an "8", I'm sure repeated plays will improve my initial impression. 

UPDATE
The game plays fast and strangely enough it has tactical and strategic decisions to it. 
It is also random enough that you don't feel it too chess-like. 
I would judge this to be a nice filler, just not completely my cup of tea.

Like its predecessor, Mr. Jack: New York is a clever, 2-player deduction game that is fast, fun and challenging.  While the rules are simple and the mental gymnastics required aren’t overly taxing, it still requires clever movement and ability combinations in order to be successful.  The detective player may have a slight advantage, but it is only slight.  Most of the games I have played have all been tense, and haven’t been decided until the final turn or two.  In the hands of a clever player, Mr. Jack can be quite devious and slippery, and catching him will take all of your skills as a detective.  

The question, of course, is whether one needs both Mr. Jack and Mr. Jack: New York in their collection.  The setting in the new version is different, as are most of the characters' abilities.  This does provide some variety.  However, unless one is an immense fan of the game and plays it often, the small differences are likely not enough to justify owning both.  That is not a knock against the game, as both are fine games and either would make a fine addition to one's collection.

RATING: 7
A game about tactical movement. There is some deduction knocking about in there, but mostly it is tactical movement to eliminate suspects. The way the Jack player moves can give hints about who they are protecting, so some bluffing. My regular opponent enjoys tactical movement, so it's a hit for us.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An improvement upon the the original Mr. Jack.
  The gameflow is more varied.

The game breaks the routines.  Here, as a detective you don't - right from the beginning - split characters in two exact halves as Mr Jack's possibilities to escape are much wider now and the focus in the first turns should be not to let the Jack escape in the first place.
As Jack, you don't keep the whole bunch of visible characters  from the beginning (as in the original game), but you try to be hidden sometimes (even if in minority of characters), because you have realistic chances of escaping in several ways.

Besides the above there are other elements contributing to more varied gameplay: ever-changing gameboard and a very neat concept of informant (something better designed and less schematic than Sherlock Holmes in the original game).

Less of obvious choices/patterns and more of interesting decisions = a better game.

EDIT: After 10 plays - it has too similar vibe to the original Mr. Jack after all...  
Sold.

RATING: 7.5
I have only played once so far and so far was  mildly disappointed after reading some reviews and getting my expectations up. 

I was hoping for more strategy considerations and different characters than the original (which I do like) but to me it turned out to be mostly the same, especially the characters, exits are the same, etc. The map does seem more interesting as it does need to be built up but just not as much as I thought it would be. 

Anyway these are only my initial thoughts after one game, I like it, its as good as the first I believe I'm just not sure its any better in the end, will play more to find out.

I like this version almost as much as the original Mr. Jack with expansion. While using Sherlock created more information every time he showed up, I find going to the island of Snitch almost useless.

Was able to win as Jack in the second round, due to the order of characters that came up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8

If you haven't played the original Mr. Jack, it's a chess-like game in which one player is trying to divide the characters on the board into two groups and the other player is trying to make one of these groups as large as possible and make sure that Jack (the killer) is included in it. The first player wins if Jack is singled out and accused. The second player wins if Jack is never accused or if he escapes from the board. The game is played over eight turns, and each turn both players move two characters. Each character also has a minor special ability that affects things like street-lighting, police barricades, etc.

Mr. Jack in New York is the same game on a new map with different characters. The new abilities make the board evolve differently each game much more than it did the original. Whereas the first Mr. Jack clearly favored the investigator, Mr. Jack in New York is more balanced and may even give a slight edge to Jack. It's too early for me to say for sure, but this new version appears to outshine the original in every way. Both are good games. If you haven't played either I recommend skipping straight to this one.

Note: There is almost no deduction in either version, despite the theme of investigation.

And I mostly don't play two player games anyway.

The system was pretty clever though, so I could appreciate the design,
and I it seemed like a potentially enjoyable game when played against

Stand alone variant of Mr. Jack. As in Mr. Jack, one player takes the role of Mr. Jack, the other takes a role of a Detective. But there are new possibilities - gaslights and manholes are represented by pawns which can be moved.

The game takes place in Manhattan, and surrounding water is very important for escape of Mr. Jack.

Characters will have new powers and there will be also a police spy, who will be able to get valuable information.

This version of the game is more strategic and complex so it is suitable for more advanced players.

It's an awesome 2-player game. I have never played the original version of Mr. Jack because when I did my research, a lot of the reviews suggested this version saying that it's better balanced than the first. It's really not an easy game though. You need to do a  lot of deduction and also calculate the possibilities and also try to guess the other player's mind. I sometimes experience burnout after a few games haha. Guess that I have an equivalent opponent lol.

I enjoy this game but didn't have fun experiences with it. My spouse doesn't like it as she struggles making decisions in this game. It's expensive for what it is though. If anyone is looking for a non-card 2 player game, I'd recommend it. Very nice components.

I like the parks; I like the informant; I like Liberty Island; I like the new characters; 
and I love NY.

The basic system is the same, but plays so differently and is even better than the original. Now as tense for the Inspector as for Mr Jack, that Jack bastard can escape so easily. One mistake and he is gone! The game has a bit more rules than the original, what makes it a bit harder to learn than normal mr Jack.

Like the designers, I recommend to play normal Mr Jack first, to train Mr Jack logic thinking and bluffing and it is still a great game. EDIT not sure about this anymore, maybe you can dive directly into this game.

An updated version of Mr Jack, set in New York.  It has some nice added mechanisms and different character movement powers, but didn't quite make it as high in my estimation as Mr Jack.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
Wow was I impressed with this game. We played twice in a row and it left me wanting to play more. It really does have deduction and a little bit of bluffing though it's not mainly about the bluffing. The deduction and secretive strategy though is fun and interesting. The fact that the components are simple, few in number/type and of high durable quality is also a plus that makes it feel very transportable and repayable.

Learning the 8 characters special abilities feels like it will take longer than it ends up taking--it's actually not a problem very quickly. The game feels pretty well balanced between the detective and Jack but what's really great is just the pacing. THough the map isn't great looking and there's nothing dazzling about the look of the components, the simplicity and elegance of the game that is head to head, very low in luck (if at all) and just great fun for both sides trying to either hide/escape or trying to figure out who is Jack is great fun. It really has great re playability.

I have decided not to get the original since people seem to say this is just better. I did order Mr. Jack pocket because I liked the portability aspect and even shorter time. I have read that it doesn't have as much depth or re playability but the portability and 15 minute play time seem interesting and worthwhile to me considering how much I liked this one. I can really see this being yet another great 2 player game that's easy to play on a week night after work or during lunch.

Thematically it seems like letters from whitechapel but it plays and feels so much differently once you actually start it that there is absolutely room for both. Letters from white chapel is about finding jack, this is about figuring out who jack is. It's also a shorter and different game overall.

Great game, I'm excited to play more of it and because of it's high fun, high strategy, low luck, and elegance, I can see it having lots of re playability without feeling bland like many euro games.

I found out who Mr Jack was in the first round of the game due to some lucky circumstances and then I had to physically catch him?

Mr Jack Pocket is much better because when you know the identity of the criminal the game ends.

RATING: 7
Tense and brain-burning asymmetric 2p-er. I have only played 3-4 times and suspect there are deeper strategies than I can see, including actual deduction elements rather than obvious "Jack's in the light, so it's not these people" eliminations.

I find the board a bit too empty at the start; it seems like you can go anywhere and barriers are worthless. The original Mr. Jack may have been better in this regard, but I've never played it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rather than one of those expansions that can be seen as an attempt to fix a game or make it more interesting, Mr. Jack in New York feels more like taking the core mechanism of Mr. Jack and applying it in a much more interesting context: the elements on the board aren't fixed. This tilts the game towards positional play and further away from deduction, but gives it much more variety. The eight roles among which Jack hides also obbey new rules, resulting in less predictable play. There is also less imbalance - Jack can defend himself a bit better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A gorgeous, subtle and thinky upgrade on the original. This is much more finely balanced and will provoke some of the best strategy headaches ever seen over a 2P table. Lovely component quality is really just the icing on the cake.

What a game! If you own the original and like it, then this one will not disappoint! When you first look at the board you think... oh how plain! But as the game plays it becomes an ever changing display and you see the artwork really is there...but it evolves as you play the game...how awesome is that! I would say it plays a bit like Mr. Jack in reverse...kind of! Instead of snuffing out one light per round, you will be adding a light to the board! One new character turns buildings into parks which provide dark spots on the board to any character that is on a park! Sweet...for placing characters in the dark! Also one character adds metro stations to the game, essentially adding more man-hole covers to the game...holey cow!

The game is basically the same as the original. Same play order, same goal, but with new characters each with a new ability and one extra special ability on the board. The board changes more as buildings can be built up and destroyed and the same for parks where characters can hide. Also, lights are not removed each turn, so the game is more balance. As good as the original and a nice change if you play a lot.

This game truly is something else. It's somehow even better than the original Mr. Jack, which is simultaneously awesome and sad. Awesome, because the original Mr. Jack was already very good, but sad because now I won't ever play Mr. Jack again. Seriously simple, but deep character options and interplay lead to a varied and strategic game EVERY SINGLE TIME. I don't know why people say this isn't a "deduction" game. You have to deduce who Mr. Jack is, don't you?

Only played the game twice so far, once as Mr Jack and once as the detective, and I thought it was excellent for a two-player game. Usually two-player games lack depth but this game doesn't suffer from that.

RATING: 6
This rating currently is very much up in the air--I could easily see it going much higher if there is a nice depth here but starting out it seems very difficult to know what to do. I suspect it will take about a dozen games to get to the point where I and my opponent both know how to play pretty well--and when you aren't playing well the game doesn't have a lot that draws me in. At low skill level the game seems very lucky even though there are few random elements. But overall much of the tension is lost as neither of us knew much about what we should be concerned about or focusing on. 

I'm hoping to get more plays in though to actually uncover what I suspect may be a game I quite enjoy. But I don't think the first several games are going to be great fun until we both start to really understand what is going on.

RATING: 8
Here are some aspects of Mr. Jack in New York that I really enjoy.

:star: The asymmetric victory conditions.  Each player has a different goal, and these opposite goals cause each player to see the various characters differently.
:star: The different abilities of the characters present different challeges and opportunities, and each role selection forces each player to weigh what her opponent would value in addition to what she herself finds valuable.
:star: Because the characters create so many options, there are a lot of decisions per minute.  Each decision has a lot of impact on the rest of the game.
:star: I love how quickly a game of Mr. Jack plays.  It's so exciting that I always feel like playing a second game  (or a third).

Mr. Jack in New York would be rated higher except I can't get over the feeling that this game has limited replayability.  It's already starting to feel a little samey.  In order to stop this from happening, I plan on playing it no more than three times in a sitting to see if that helps.  But it must be a good game if it is one that I want to play more than three times in a sitting.

I have not played the original Mr. Jack, so I cannot compare the new game to the old game.

After so many plays of Mr. Jack and then a few more of the expansion, this one is like starting all over again.  Some things are so familiar, but enough new stuff that it will take a few plays to get comfortable with all the options.

The biggest change is the empty (or nearly so) board that gets more developed as the game goes on.  An interesting mix of new characters as well.  Certainly looks like it might be as good as the original, just need to get more comfortable with the changes to decide if it in fact is.

The same core idea as the original game, but totally different map and character abilities, plus a little additional chrome to learn.

I loved the original, so I should love this version, right? Well no. The reason the original worked so well for me was because of how simple the abilities for the characters were and how they worked so well together. The abilities for this game may work well together, but they're so much more complex that it makes the game too much when you're just looking for a light game.

Takes the basics of Mr. Jack and changes the setting to New York with eight new character with eight new abilities. Instead of removing lampposts in Mr. Jack New York the character abilities add lamppost, metro stations, building sites and park conversions (turning these into dark spot refuges).

If you're a fan of Mr. Jack then you'll probably enjoy the new challenges of playing this variation. I'm personally in two minds whether I need to own both, but small people in my household enjoying playing both so much with me that for now I'll be keeping hold of both copies. The consensus around here is that Mr. Jack New York is slightly more challenging and offers more replay value. The original Mr. Jack is easier for younger kids to play well. Both games seem balanced to me, but there's no doubting it's easier for the Mr. Jack player to make a mistake and throw the game away. (Kids will have an easier time playing the detective.) Mr. Jack New York seems like the timing of the character cards coming out makes more of a difference than in the original and will have more of an influence on the result. Either way, the subtleties of who the Mr. Jack player chooses and chooses to save and doesn't choose and doesn't choose to save - it's where the game gets a lot of its soul in the bluffing and reading of the other player's actions. Delightful.

Another winner in the Mr. Jack franchise.  After the first play, have similar feelings as I did when I added the extension to the original.  Fun, enjoyable, but need to play it a bit more to become more comfortable with the options.  

Definitely easier for Jack to win on this one, but not so much as to make it a runaway.

Jogo rápido de dedução. Me pareceu meio invariável. Envolve alguma estratégia, mas ainda não deu pra sacar a verdadeira profundidade (se é que ela existe). Vários elementos, como poderes e construções, acabam enfraquecidos ou inúteis, pois são voltados para a questão da identidade do assassino, que até agora foi revelada logo nos primeiros turnos do jogo. O informante por exemplo, ainda não foi usado.

Ack; this was disappointing. Luck is still too strong a factor and the detective still has too much of an advantage over Jack. I think these (...in New York and the original Mr. Jack) are good gateway games and I would play them with someone new to board games, but I don't otherwise see myself wanting to pull them out again.

Nehezebb, mint a sima játék, de nem feltétlenül jobb. Egyértelműen gyakorlottabb játékosoknak ajánlott a folyton változó pálya miatt. Érdekes, színes, jól működő új karakterek, teljesen rendben levő újragondolása az alapjátéknak. Tetszett ez is, de nem jobban, mint a másik. Ez egy játék alapján lehet teljesen megalapozatlan kijelentés, de úgy érzetem, hogy míg az alapban a nyomozó dolga a kicsit könnyebb, itt meg talán Jacké.

[2014-07-22]
Két újabb játék után is Jackkel érzem könnyebbnek ezt a verziót.

[2015-11-09]
További játékok után egyértelműnek látszik, hogy a nyomozóval itt sokkal nehezebb a játékos dolga.

What an elegant, brilliant game design. Jack does seem rather abstract when you are playing it, ie - you dont feel like you are really an investigator trying to catch a criminal, let alone feeling like the malicious jack the ripper. But, as long as you go in with this in mind, the game will trap you in an addictive mind-puzzle that does not overstay its welcome, and is indeed very fun. I describe it as a chess game in which one player is attempting to capture the king, but without knowing which piece is masquerading as the king, and with all the pieces having special movement powers, and while only being able to move certain pieces at once. Throw into this mix a brilliant deduction mechanic, and you have a masterful design and an exciting, wonderful game.

What a truly fantastic game this is!  Just as with the Mr. Jack Extension, this game provides a similar-but-entirely-new Mr. Jack experience.  It is highly strategic with the openness of the map and the fact that the topography is constantly changing.  And that map feels tight!  It seems like escape could be much easier for the Jack player, yet, other than the parks, there are very few places where he can hide.  This edition has an equally high level of production as the original game (except this time there aren't any board or character card printing errors, thankfully), and is equally as fun.  Time will tell if this version of "Mr. Crack" grips me with the same obsessive addiction as the previous ones, but I have already felt the first dose racing through my veins...  Game design: 5/5  Personal enjoyment: 5/5  Total: 10/10

I have never played the original Jack. I bought this New York version (I like the graphics and alleged rules flexibility better), read the rules, and played one practice game with my wife. I played Jack. (My wife loves the deduction in the Detective's role, I like the tactics of the Jack role.) She beat me of course. But in my defense I had a bad cold at the time. Next time I'll be healthy and sharp-witted - which means it will take her longer to beat me. 

At the moment I have very little idea of how to win this game. But this game appears to me to have a ton of potential for long-term enjoyment and replayability. This could be the best 2 player game I've played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fussy set of rules and a handful of design gaffes make Mr. Jack in New York much harder to teach and play than it should be.  The instruction manual comes with a large page of FAQs to resolve the rules conflicts, and it's not exhaustive.  Those details DO create a squirrelly play area that is tense and tactical, but it's hard to immerse one's self in the experience.  Mr. Jack in New York is a casual game that can't be played casually.

Like Imperial 2030, Mr. Jack in New York is another fantastic follow-up that will by vying for my Game of the Year for 2009 (unless I decide to exclude both from contention given the fact that they're sequels, which I may end up doing). As with my warning for Imperial 2030, Mr. Jack in New York is a fantastic stand-alone game that meets or exceeds the high bar set by its predecessor, but it doesn't change enough to make it something that you're likely to enjoy if you didn't enjoy the original Mr. Jack. Having played the original Mr. Jack 49 times, I can say I'm a big fan of this Cathala-Maublanc team effort (not to mention the fantastic artwork of Pierre Lechevalier). Fortunately I've had the chance now to play the sequel 5 times and am fairly certain its a very worthy successor. It's clear that Cathala and Maublanc have learned a lot about the game system in the intervening 3 years since Mr. Jack was released, and have tweaked that system just enough to create a stand-alone game worth owning. Mr. Jack in New York offers a new board and 8 new characters with all new special abilities (although many will be reminiscent of the special abilities in the original game). The most striking thing about the new board and gameplay is that it is much more open. There are less buildings and gaslights obstructing your path at the outset because you build them over the course of the game with the new characters' special abilities. The game is much more dynamic than the original. Where Mr. Jack feels static, Mr. Jack in New York feels fluid. I don't have enough experience with the latter to say for certain that its an improvement, but I get that sense from my initial plays and I trust that the designers have learned more about the game system since its release (and particularly given their work on the excellent Mr. Jack Extension). As with Imperial 2030, this is not a game for people who didn't enjoy the original (unless you simply had small nit-picks), but for fans of the original, this is proving to be a very good year for sequels.

Mr. Jack in New York is an improvement on Mr. Jack in almost every possible way: modular board, more balanced between Jack and Inspector, more tactics and strategy, more balance between abilities of characters (unlike in the base game where Goodley is overpowered and Watson is highly underpowered, for example.) I love the added element of the Informant to draw Alibi cards. My favorite aspect of New York is Liberty Island, which can be cleverly utilized by both Jack and the Inspector. The transformation of metros, lights and buildings into parks is also brilliant. This is a phenomenal evolution of the Mr. Jack framework.

To play this well you have to think up to 3 moves ahead while allowing for all the permutations for special abilities.  It's a mental workout.  I was hoping for something more casual.  If I'm going to have to think that many moves ahead I'd MUCH rather play Go.

Nice game, but because you need to be very careful of your words and expressions during the game, or the other might get too much clues, this is a very quiet game.

Hard to say whether this is as good as the original yet.  It is a *way* more wide open game, so I could see liking it better in the end if I were to play each one a few hundred times.  It's remarkable how different the two games feel despite their similarities.  Right now, I like the constrained feel of the original a bit more, but that might just be because I understand it better.  Time will tell.

Interaktív tematikus játék 2 fő részére, ahol az eredeti (Mr. Jack) játékkal ellentétben teljesen kiegyensúlyozottan vetélkedhet a menekülő hasfelmetsző Jack és az őt üldöző nyomozó. Előbbinek el kell hagynia a félszigetet, utóbbinak a játékkörök során kell kiszűrnie, ki mindenki nem lehet Jack, hogy végül megvádolhassa őt, mielőtt az elmenekülne valamelyik hajóval a félszigetről. A játék 8 körön át tart, és akkor van vége, ha jack elmenekül, vagy ha megvádolják bármikor, de azt nem érdemes találgatva megtenni, mert téves vád esetén is véget ér a játék.  
A hiteles, valóban élt new yorki karakterek mindegyike valamilyen egyedi képesség folytán tud segítségére lenni mindkét félnek. Mindkét játékos bármelyik szereplővel léphet (természetesen szabályozva, mikor, melyik 4 közül, melyikük választhat szereplőt). 
A játék jó, kellemes és interaktív, szívesen leül hozzá az ember, ráadásul nem is hosszú, mégis marad némi hiányérzet azzal kapcsolatban, hogy vajon mi köze az egésznek hasfelmetsző Jackhez, ha a tematikának nem része Jack gyilkos működése. Ilyenformán izgalmak az üldözött személy kilétével kapcsdolatos titok ellenére sincsenek, és a sok apróság, ami meghatározza a lépések lehetőségeit, megmarad külsőséges eszköznek, hogy az üldözés kiegyensúlyozott módon történjen.

GAME: The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin
RANK: 3024
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Have paired with Star Munchkin to make a ghetto Firefly Munchkin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Funny jokes and references, but it's just a simple "take that"/"screw you" type of card game that can drag on way too long for what it is. The rules are so light that there is very little structure and little in the way of restrictions on how much you can try to screw someone in a turn.

Sadly, SJ Games seems to care little for this spinoff.  I'm not much for the Old West theme in games, but it works here.  The Classes are useful and work nicely with/against each other.  Here's hoping it will get expanded someday...

Very short game of Munchkin...one player won a huge battle early, and nobody else had anything left to stop him from winning in a runaway.  Not my favorite theme either.

RATING: 7
Fun cowboy themed, if that's not too obvious. Not too fast, but doesn't drag on if people know how to play. Good amount of death, which I like, cause I'm a vicious munchkin.

Ugh really?  I am waiting for Munchkin Flux so I can Die the most painful death imaginable!!!

Otherwise known as Munchkin:  Make a bunch of crappy expansions, good for exactly one laugh in a game that should be ten minutes expanded into untold hours of torture wishing that you had the +2 rapier of suicide so you could kill yourself an get it over with all ready!

Said Game will make Steve Jackson Games a bazillion Munchkin Gold pieces off of a really boring, looong, and repetitive game, sold to gamers too brain dead from playing this stupid game to know better than to buy more crappy expansions with the same jokes rehashed over and over and over.

So, I've played this and vanilla Munchkin, and I like this one better I think... They are both so random and swingy that I have to be in just the right mood to play them. If someone really wants to play, I'll play with them. There are just so many games that are better...

This is not really a "game", it's an activity where you sit and exchange cards, while pulling randomly from a pile. One of the worst rulebooks and card layouts. It's an atrocity among games (I had a good time, but that was entirely because of my friends).

Munchkin, it's not very in depth. It's games tend to be too long. I don't enjoy this one that much, but it's good for a party of people since it can handle any number of players, it's quick to learn, and not overly difficult.

RATING: N/A
Family players liking less than they anticipated from downloaded game play video clips.

One of my biggest faults with the cards is how few duplicates there are of types like Loaded Die etc where the card mechanism assumes everybody has another to create a chain of result tampering.

I havn't played this yet, but it appears to be the same as Munchkins, just in the west. Most of the games have had some "element" that is unique to that game. Such as super powers in Super Munchkin, or "loyalty" in Munchkin Impossible. However I didn't see anything with This one that was overly different or unique. Oh well, Munchkins still rule.

RATING: 7
As far as Munchkins go, this is one of the good ones. The jokes aren't as fresh as the original set, but are still very solid. And game play wise, it can actually be the quickest of the games if you've got a fast horse and you're beating the right monster. Even when I don't win the game, this shorter game is a nice change of pace from many of the other versions which usually tend to overstay their welcome. Also, this is the game which I find works best when mixing with other versions of Munchkin. Combining it with Star Munchkin to create Firefly Munchkin is one of our groups favorite versions of the game.

RATING: 6
Like most of the Munchkin series, this game is a fun, simple game to play with casual gamers.  Lots of alliances and back-stabbing between players and certainly a good 'ice-breaker' game.  Whilst there is an element of strategy in Munchkin, a lot relies upon the vagaries of the cards which means that the eventual winner is often decided by a chaotic scramble. 

Munchkin games really only work with more than three players as that really allows the social dynamics of the game to come out.  The rules are simple to teach but I feel that the game lacks a depth that will leave most board game enthusiasts cold.

In order for this game to be good you need a wild fun group either drunk or really tired and therefore likely to say stupid/funny things. Otherwise this is a tedious exercise in the mundane.

Used to always play this before my gateway game. Was relatively fun at first, however the game eventually kept turning someone gets to the last monster, everyone stops him from beating it, and the cycle repeats until no one has items to throw at the final player. A lot of luck on who gets the better items and monsters. Fun if you don't take it seriously, but even then tends to get boring after a lot of plays.

I came to the conclusion that munchkin filled a niche for my friends and I during High School that helped us pass time on break periods and lunches, but no longer fulfills that purpose. Since having discovered other games where luck is not the entire determining factor of the game and where kingmaking isn't immediately relevant, I've come to relegate practically all munchkin games in the "play only if desperate or forced" category of games I own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Random as all hell, basically no skill involved whatsoever.  It's a chaotic, mindless, mess of a game.  I have to deduct points for that.  But I'll be damned if it isn't one of the funniest, funnest little games out there.  Well, as long as you have the right group.  As long as the guys and gals you're playing with know that the game is all about silly randomness and being a complete jerk to the person next to you without really meaning it, Munchkin is awesome.  It has its limitations, hence the 6, but I'd still recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of whimsical murdery fun.

Only played it once but did not enjoy it at all. No idea why there are so many versions out there...

RATING: 7.8
One of my favorite western movies now in a condensed silly Munchkin format.  OK, maybe not a replay of the movie but a nice idea to expand this ever expandable game.  Probably my favorite version after Muchkin Cthulu.

Munchkin with the klunky addition of steeds, which are just weird henchmen.  Unimpressed.

A really wonderfull surprise - it is my first game of this "draw route" type. Can be played at any count, anywhere. Simple rules but still a lot of choices - though after a dozen of play you have a good idea of an optimal strategy. The perfect game to take on a trip with your family.

Playing this game is easy. Trivial. Flip a card and draw that road segment in your map grid someplace. Anywhere you like, as long as you've not drawn in that square before.

Playing it well though, with the random ordering of roads and scoring opportunities and that pressure to keep scoring more than you did last round? That makes it a compelling puzzle to play with friends or solo!

Great little game. Can be very satisfying connecting up your little road network, but also very challenging - in a good way. More strategy to it than first meets the eye. Good at any player count, and even as an occasional solo game too. Only reason I traded this away is that I'm upgrading to the newer rethemed version - Kokoro.

JAGRAW (Just Another Generic Roll-and-Write). I am starting to get bored with this style of game. This one is a little more interesting than others (Rolling Japan, Qwixx, Qwinto, Noch Mal!) because of the addition of the cards. You can make some meaningful decisions as to what spaces to save/risk for future draws/rows, and the game has some tension, but in the end it still just feels like Bingo.

Avenue is a cute version of Doodle City, but with cards instead of dice. If you're careful, you can keep track of the cards that have come out and plan accordingly. In that respect, it might be slightly deeper while being more streamlined, but I did enjoy the different ways to score in Doodle City as well. Still a fun game.

Souvenir from Strasbourg 2017.

So surprisingly good! When I saw this on the shelf at Philibert and knew it was hard to come by in the US and had such a strong following of reviewers and friends I trust, I decided it was worth the cheap price tag to try it. And we just started playing it over and over when we were in France. We have to be careful not to play it too much, as we don't want to get sick of it!

A surprising re-imagining of the authors' earlier game [i]Doodle City[/i]. The rule that farms must score better than previous farms lends the game a very agreeable bite for the game's scope and length. It was a blind guessbuy at Spiel 2016, and I'm pleased to conclude that it all worked yet again. I think I rather like crayon games.

Players draw a network of roads on their player sheet, trying to connect their farms and castles to grapes. Each round, a card is drawn that shows which type of road the players must draw. Some cards are marked as scoring cards, and when the fourth scoring card is drawn, a new farm is scored. The order in which the farms are scored is revealed one-by-one throughout the game, so players must constantly adapt their strategies.

Surprisingly good game in a small package. Draw roads and try to connect cities to grapes (and other cites). The order in which the cities score and the different roads appear is random so no two games are the same.

Not sure how often it will be fun to play though, even after a couple of plays there's a sameness to it. Different maps would be cool.

A cute little game that consists only of a scorepad and a small deck of cards. Every round a farm card is revealed that will be scored and cards are drawn showing a path direction which you must find a spot for and draw on your scorepad. After 4 yellow cards are drawn the farm is scored and the next round begins. Your aim is to connect as many grapes as you can to the farm that's being scored, however, if your next score is lower than the previous one you score 0. You also score bonus points at game end for green grapes connected to a green castle and red grapes connected to a pink castle. Add up your score at the end and minus 5 points for every 0. Person with the most points wins!

I expected to like it a lot more than I did. It was fine to while away 5 mins, just not very exciting or fun. You also didn't feel like you had any control over the outcome and were mostly subject to luck of the draw so at times it was incredibly frustrating. In our games the scoring cards came out quite frequently which resulted in us having low scores with a bunch of dead ends everywhere. It didn't feel like we had anything to shoot for, or any incentive to keep playing. We took advantage of the 'peeking' option but more often than not we found it useless. What can you do when 4 scoring cards come out in a row? or when they are all in awkward orientations? We just felt like we were wasting out game time. That being said, I backed its successor Kokoro: Avenue of the Kodama on Kickstarter and I'm curious to see how the decree cards change the game up.

C'est sympa mais il y a 0 interaction entre les joueurs. Le nom n'est pas adapté (on construit des chemins vicinaux dans des vignes pour les relier à ses domains d'exploitation). En gros, on trace des traits sur une grille au fur et à mesure. Le trait qu'on doit faire est défini par des cartes tirées au hasard et il faut s'en démerder. On compte les points à la fin. Sympa mais pas inoubliable.

A relaxing bingo-esque game.

The caller draws a card that shows what kind of line everyone must draw on their sheet. Maybe it is a horizontal line, or an L-shaped line. Etc. After three yellow-colored cards are revealed, the current round ends for scoring. There was a current target city showing for the round, and you score points based on how many grapes you were able to connect to that city. HOWEVER, the number must be greater than the previous round, or you are forced to record a 0.

The graphic design is simple and easy to understand compared to Kokoro (which is like a v2.0). The main difference though is that the grapes are just different colors, either pink or green, which isn't color-blind friendly.

I added this game to the collection about a year ago and I don't regret it. It's a filler game that you can play with up to 10 people according to the box, but anyone can join actually, there's no real player number restriction. Each game is different depending on how the cards come out, resulting in a fun puzzle everytime it gets played. Another plus is that both seasoned and casual gamers can enjoy a game like this.

A follow-up to Aporta's [gameid=162107]. Instead of dice, it has cards. Points are scored in intermediate scorings, not immediately. Gameplay feels so similar that there's no need to own both. Both games are ok as a filler but nothing I would seek out.

I'm not sure I can articulate why I like this game better than something like Traxx. Sure, this space is very crowded, but I think this is the best of its type (type being simultaneous-Take-It-Easy-type-drawing-game). I like the risk-taking involved, which can be frustrating, but also exhilarating when it works out. The theme is meaningless, but at least the box art is nice!

Overall, Avenue is super. It's short, highly transportable, got a cool concept, and delivers it with a cute theme. It's one of my go-to openers at game nights, and I'm pretty much always down for a game. That said, Kokoro is at least the same game as Avenue, but with (in my opinion) better art and whiteboards + erasable markers, which already significantly improves Avenue. Plus, it's (to my knowledge) a licensed re-theme of the game, so it's not anything weird or uncomfortable. While I think Avenue is great, I'd highly recommend just getting Kokoro unless you absolutely hate the theme or whiteboards, and I'll have a review of the changes Kokoro brings to Avenue coming in the next few months.

Interesting filler game of drawing lines to optimally score points. Successor of Doodle City. I think I slightly prefer this one, without the dice, but cards instead. Each round you have to score higher than the former or you score 0. Good tension. i like the castle scoring in the end too. It can make people catch up to even win the game.

Similar to a release from last year, draw a tile and mark the route on your card.  the goal is to connect up specific cities and colored spaces, but each time you need to achieve a higher score.

Super light game, but really fun. The game is very short and the fun is to beat your opponent and try to get a ridicolous score. There is a push your luck aspect that I really like.

We usually play two or three games in a row after dinner, really works well for that.

A fast playing "card flip & write" game of gathering grapes. It's very easy to learn and teach, but has some challenging aspects during play.

[b]Avenue[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Took a flyer on Avenue and ended up getting a great game. The quick pitch is take Karuba and get rid of all the fiddly set up and you have Avenue. I really like Karuba, but setting up that game takes as long as playing it, so it keeps it sits on the shelf when we are looking for a quick game/opener. With Avenue you open the box, give everyone a sheet, shuffle some cards and start playing. 

I also think I prefer the scoring in Avenue, especially since you have to score higher inn each successive round or you score 0, needless to say I score too many zeros. Avenue is simple to teach and really a blast to play. My only concern is that all the sheets have the same layout, but so far our games have played out quite differently. It also wouldn't take much to come out with new maps and sell them as mini expansions, here's hoping the game warrants this. For the price I'd highly recommend taking a flier on Avenue, especially if you're looking for some games to fill out a game order.[/i]

"True multi-player solitaire. It requires an interesting blend of short- and long-term planning. Not outstanding, but a reasonable filler, especially at high player counts."

What I like:
- Filler, with no attacks (or other interaction)
- Plays any number of players

What I don't like
- Our 7p game took 50 minutes, which is too long for a game like this
- At 5p, with no first-timers, it took 40, which is still too long
- Graphical design has some big flaws (notably using yellow on 2 types of cards)

I enjoyed this game. I feel like there was a lot of planning involved to try to keep the scoring points increasing to avoid the 0 and penalty. Also, having to find time to link in the castles for end game scoring was fun. I'd happily play this as a filler and like that it can play an INFINITE amount of players as long as you have the sheets without even adding to the amount of time. Crazy how everyone is given identical board/tiles but end up with such different sheets. Fun! I'm excited to try it again. I liked it better than Karuba even without the fact that its more portable and easier to play with more players.

This game is for 1-10 players, but we have played with 15 players and it still worked brilliantly.  It makes a great thinky party game.

Really enjoy this game, but I backed Kokoro and don't need both in my collection.

tl;dr: average [thing=162107][/thing] copy

I didn't dig in to this game before Spiel, so I just put it on my list because it was a route building transportation game. Turns out that that part is represented by a sheet on which you draw lines. Kind of like  Doodle City. In fact, I would say this game is the same but different. It fills the exact same niche and thus there is no reason to own both. And while I didn't dislike Doodle City, I didn't feel the need to own a copy either.
Oh, the box is a bit over sized, and they didn't even include pens!

Initial rating: 6.5/10

How fitting that I played Avenue in the same evening as Doodle City. Their core similarities (drawing roads on a grid) also reveal the interesting ways in which their optimization puzzles fundamentally differ. In Avenue, everyone starts with an identical board. Cards are flipped one at a time, and the challenge is for everyone to make the best board using the same cards. Each card depicts a road segment, and you have to fit it onto your board to maximize your deliveries. The one monkey wrench is that certain cities score in a random order. You can skip your turn to look ahead at the next scoring opportunity or take your chances that everything will work out. That simple look-ahead mechanic adds some much-needed variety, but I'm not sure it's really enough.

I prefer Doodle City's drafting mechanic to ensure that everyone's puzzle is slightly different. But Avenue does an admirable job working with fewer complications. It's a solid filler game, and one I'd certainly play again.

It's fine. Karuba is the better, more dynamic Bingo-style route-building game. Avenue has the advantage of being able to play technically any number of players. Karuba has the advantage of looking nicer and being more fun to play.

This one is different in the roll and write series because your drawing cards instead of rolling a die for movement. Shocking..... lol. But over all its a nice lite experience with everyone playing solitaire. I don't tend to like that because I prefer more interaction with players. But a solid game that a ton of people can play at one time.

Highly recommended. A lot more interesting than it seems. My only concern is replayability, but that remains to be seen.

Meh. I was excited to play but it just doesn't deliver much fun beyond the novelty of drawing paths.

Great gateway. Enjoy the push your luck element.

A fun puzzle-type game. I wish they would release different player boards/pads to add variation. As long as all players were using the same board I don't see why it would matter?

Easy to learn, not for the smallest kids. A good game for more experienced gamers as well.

This is a delightful little puzzle game with a small push your luck element. I highly recommend it.

RATING: 7.7
Very nice "roll and write" but instead of dice it's handled by cards.
Very nice options in each turn since you can easily block yourself depending on the cards.
Very smooth gameplay since everyone writes simultaneously
Only sold it since I got the re-implementation (kokoro avenue of kodama with the variable goals and powers)

Great filler, there is a path for everybody to make and it always different.

A multiplayer solitaire game in the vein of the Rolling series of games. I enjoyed the puzzle very much though and would like to own it when it gets reprinted. Great for a road trip or a quick filler with unlimited number of players.

As much as I like Doodle City this one is even better, It's got more tension, needs more planning, and has more push-your-luck elements. Nice!

One of the very best roll-and-write games I've ever played (though technically this isn't that, as it has no dice). Tricky, well thought out, and brightly themed. Love it.

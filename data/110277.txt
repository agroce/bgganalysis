Interesting game, but very chaotic. You don't have the time to look over the shoulder of the other players, because you have enough to do with building up your own space station. People that want to cheat can probably do so plentily here. Would need a "check over your neighbor's space station for errors" phase like in Galaxy Trucker.

Requires several plays to enjoy the counter drafting strategy and requires objectives to be in play to really bring the game to life.  Would like to have seen era restricted cards likes 7 wonders as it can feel a little random what comes up where.  Solid game if you are willing to give it a few goes.

RATING: 6
A combination of card drafting and tile laying.  Many similarities with 7 Wonders, but has less long-term strategy.  The special powers and objectives add a bit more long-term strategy, but not enough for my taste.  If I want to play a drafting game, I'd take 7 Wonders ahead of this any time.

An interesting take on the card drafting mechanic and while I enjoyed the challenge that comes with the layout playing an important part, the lack of any progression in terms of cost/VPs means it fell a little flat.

Planning to sell/trade. There just isn't enough variation in the base game - multiple of the same card in each hand, minimal objectives that all do the same thing... compared to 7 Wonders, this one has very little replayability now. I will, however, miss my Observatory and the little energy cubes!

RATING: 7
9/27/13:  Card drafting with tile laying and some other stuff.  Kind of neat.  A little annoying in that you keep having to reassess your opponents' boards.

I would have rated this a 6 but for a few things.  I want to like this more than I do and I want to play it more to see if I like it more.  There's some really nice variability in the game setup.  I Kickstarted the expansion so I'm going to own this and the expansion and maybe that will help.

Give it a shot!  The game is definitely good enough to warrant a look and a play.  And it expands on the concepts from 7 Wonders in a nice direction, one that 7 Wonders doesn't quite hit.

EDIT (3/26/16):  Some of the modules from the expansions are an excellent fit.  They expand gameplay without adding significant complexity or time.  I'm thinking of goals, events, and races.  Some of the other modules might be in a similar vein, but those are the ones off the top of my head.  Definitely worth incorporating some/all of those and possibly others.  Provides some nice variety on a good base system.  I do suggest limiting it to 2-4 players and going in knowing that it can bog down at times (depending on the players).  Otherwise a very nice game!  (Good luck getting all the promo stuff if you're a completionist like me!)

If you take 7wonders, remove the theme, remove some of the mechanics, and slap a space theme on it, you get this game. I'm maybe being a little harsh with a 4, but I can't think of a single reason other than space art as to why I'd play this over 7 wonders. 

Also, every turn was just "which card gives me the most points for the least money." I did like that we played twice so that I could make sure it wasn't first play bias.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good game, it is very based on 7 wonders using the draft mechanics, exchange cards for money and other stuff, so not very original mechanics. But the theme is very good and there is a spacial perception in the station locations that is welcome. Without the agression cards there is almost no interaction between players, what is a bad thing I think.

RATING: 6
Some interesting mechanics (drafting items and building a spaceship with them, where locations care about proximity to each other, etc).  However, overall it is clearly inferior to 7 wonders.  Particularly annoying are cards with effects such as "You may give a point to 1 opponent of your choice.  If you do, gain 2 points".  Hey look, lets all give points to the guy we think is worse at the game and screw the experienced player!  Also "steal $2 from opponents of your choice".  Lets all build these and rob the guy who is good at this game so that he loses!  Such targetted attack mechanics dont have any place in this type of game and completely ruin it.

RATING: 6
Card drafting with an interesting spatial element and a nice theme. However, I find the continuous scoring after every turn to be tedious and to detract from theme immersion. I would have also liked for each location type/color to have a more distinctive feel in terms of gameplay (i.e. distinctive interactions with cards of the same type).

Two player rules are terrible.  There is an expansion with another way to play the game as a two player game and that looked a lot better.  Have not gotten it to the table since I saw those though.

The box and price point are also an embarrassment.  This game easily fits in a small sandwich bag with a huge amount of empty box on the shelf.

With 3 and 4 the game is quite fun though.

RATING: 6
Among the Stars is a great 3-4 player game but does 2-player poorly. Even with Kim's and the official variant, you're really just playing draft or dark draft. Sorry, but pack draft has never been and never will be a skill-based exercise once you wield a quantum of competence. Open draft would've produced a far more skill based, and yet comfy game (cough-Revival-cough).

But let's go over the good because I assure you, that is the only bad in this game:

• Card quality is moderate to decent quality. I would still personally sleeve the cards just to get a better tactile feel. Chit quality is A+, as are the rest of the components. Great job here.

• The game is very nicely balanced and provides the exact experience you would expect from being told about it.

• Building a station is just plain fun. Having to be mindful of where you put things in relation to others, still trying to get that "space station" feel, and seeing something you invested time and money into grow makes you feel like a true entrepreneur.

• This game lends itself to narrative moments and emergent gameplay. Often, the calculated perfect way to build your station is also what your gut tells you due to narrative weight. Don't put gardens near guns... And it's fun to come up with Babylon-5esque stories afterward. This would probably make a great Space Station RP tool.

• Scoring makes sense and wastes nothing. I get tired of games that ignore actions which lead you to money or using precious resources. Not here. You get VP for power stations that are fully used to capacity, credits you prudently didn't spend, and other such things. Good job here.

I would say if there's one other nitpick I could have toward the game, it would be a named and tiered set of titles you get based on your points. Roll Player does this with the ending VP and helps players understand how well they did overall, not just comparative to their opponents.

I would normally rate a game with these positive features 8 or 9 but I never have enjoyed the base mechanics of this game in ANY game I've played in the past. It also doesn't help that the game advertises 2P when it's actually 3P-4P, and the 2P is a watered down technicality. It's hard to build a nice space station on a low quality frame.

Awesome eight ways from Sunday. Kind of "7 Wonders in space", but the abilities of the cards, the interactions among them and the added spatial element make it a different beast. The variability added by the setup rules, specially with the Ambassadors expansion (get it!), makes every game fresh. Promo cards (also easy to get from Artipia) add even more variety and the ability to play up to 6. For 2 players, the entwife 2P variant works great and improves a lot on the original 2P rules. On top of it, the artwork is breathtaking. Cons: needs a very large table, and is quite language dependant. Highly recommended.

Card drafting with a spatial element in that drafted cards are assembled to form a space station.  As in many city development games, you'll want to put some cards in close proximity to some others and far away from some other others. Quite a nice idea, but it felt as though the designer could have done more with it.  

The drafting is pretty straightforward, with money and energy the only resources.  With the resources stripped back, there is no sense of engine building; it's all about the victory points from the outset. At least discarding a card to gain more of those resources feels much less wasteful than it does in a certain other card drafter that I have vowed not to mention in these comments. There's an element of rinse and repeat across Among the Stars' four rounds as there is no progression to higher value cards.  

I have only played the Stronghold edition.  Production quality is good.  The card artwork is quite busy and it is difficult to identify exactly what another player has in their tableau.



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I think this kicks 7 Wonders to the curb for me. I like the space station theme (better than civilization building anyway) and I like the additional element of the tile laying. One thing I wonder if I miss is the (little) interactivity that 7 Wonders has; there isn't as much with your neighbor in this. Also the lack of resource building sort of feels odd. But overall - like this base game better than 7 Wonders base.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good drafting game with great artwork and interesting mechanics. The cards you draft are actually rooms for the space station that you build. The placement of the tiles are crucial because each one gives you points depending the tiles around it.
Among The Stars is quite similar to 7 Wonders but the tile placing aspect really sets it apart. There are also some racial tiles that give each player a unique ability. Its easy to teach and fun to play! Just make sure you have a big table.

This game seems like an attempt to take the 7 Wonders mechanic, add a spatial element to it, followed by a paste of Sci-Fi/Space theme.  Sort of works, and I'd play it again, but I don't think it plays as well as 7 Wonders and the totally random nature of the card draws is a flaw.

Among the stars is very similar in mechanics with 7 Wonders. The card drafting work in the same way, discard for money, build or discard to get a reactor, the game brings some new things but until I get to see a game with the extras and the aggressive mode the rating is 7. The graphics though are one of the best I've seen so far in a board game.

This is a good drafting game. I want to play it more. From what I have seen, it seems to have some replayability.

After some plays:

I like this game. Obviously it has to be compared to 7 Wonders, but personally I find the gameplay experience provided by these games different enough.

+Race abilities
+Abilities on cards seem carefully balanced, difficult to make a choice between cards.

-The spacial element can contribute to a bit of downtime
-I don't like the Maximum Vp's mechanic. I know it contributes a lot to balancing the game, but it prevents the players from developing greatly different stations during the game. I wish there was another way of limiting the power of the cards, less absolute.

RATING: 7
It's got the card drafting mechanic of 7 Wonders with the spatial tile placement of Suburbia. Plays nicely at a low player count unlike 7 Wonders. There's definitely a sense of accomplishment at the end when you've built a beautiful space ship that makes sense (or doesn't).

Simultaneous play minimizes downtime, though there is definitely still some because of all the text on the cards. It's hard to get a sense of what your opponents are doing because there's so much going on in their space station. The game lacks the sense of advancement since there's no variability in the cards you can get in the four years. End game scoring is also a pain.

Initial rating, based on playing once. Lovely art, but I was distinctly underwhelmed; the basic game lacks strategic possibilities.

RATING: 3
The prospect of a 7-Wonders card drafting game, with an abstract/spatial element, was something that excited me. But overall, this design fails to understand what made 7-Wonders a great game and falls flat as a consequence. For instance, 7-Wonders has distinct strategies the build throughout the different rounds. Thus identifying those strategies, to "hate draft" and block them, makes 7-Wonders an interactive game. Furthermore, it forces players to make a decision about pursing their own interest versus hindering their opponents' interest. But this game lacks such distinct strategies and thus lacks tension and feels repetitive.

Overall, this was a disappointing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Combine the drafting mechanism of 7 Wonders, the tile placement and variable goals of Suburbia, put it IN SPACE and you got Among the Stars. However, I did quite enjoy this game more than that would imply.

The sci-fi space theme is generic (the named alien races are unmemorable) and tacted on (Would a re-themed version in Renaissance Italy or a psuedo-Middle-Earth fantasy world be any different? Probably not.). But it works well enough for a euro game (the different cards' names, costs point values and abilities fit with each other and give players an idea of what cards to choose and where to place them). I'm also partial to sci-fi general, so I will let that those objections pass.

Each player gets an special ability, which differ from each other more than the different wonders from 7 Wonders. There is one race with 13 credits per round (instead of 10) and one with reactors-as-type-jokers. Yeah, the race names are unmemorable (I wonder if discriptive names like in Cosmic Encounter would have been better). They probably provide very different game play experiences but I wonder if they are balanced.

The game play is as describe as above. You choose a card from a hand and play intimidately into you grid of cards. Then pass your remanding cards to next player as you get your next hand from another player. The spatial perquisites vary depending on thematic content of the cards, but generally they require cards of same type (sometimes of the same exact type) be adjacent to each other. There are (surprising to me) quite a few 'interactive' cards, such as the one that allows a player to get an extra two point for giving another player a point.

All-in-all, this a very tactical game, more than 7 Wonders. You're engine building in 7 Wonders, trying to build up a resource/trading base to the build the point generating cards later on. In Among the Stars, you're mostly just trying to get the most points per credit expenditures while trying to keep your station as open as possible and trying to meet the objectives.

 I know a lot of people compare this is 7 Wonders, but besides the drafting and stages I really feel this game is different. I love the spatial aspect of the game, and building the station with "titles" (square cards) just feels really nice. I still like 7 Wonders better, but this definitely comes close

AtS is a simpler version of 7 Wonders which is good to teach and play as a gateway game. 7W took me almost as long to explain as to play with all the different colored cards, symbols and scoring... But without the  improvement of the 3 (Age) decks and close to no engine building actions, AtS feels less exciting.

The setup of a game is the weakest part of this really fun drafting game. We really enjoy it, and have had better times playing this than 7 Wonders! We also prefer the theme which feels a lot more apparent to us in the game.

I like the drafting but this game is super fiddly to set up and the positional aspects of the cards I found to be more annoying than clever. All the cards felt like they were basically worth the same amount of points or at least it was way easy to figure out which card you should take. This game also lacks any sort of arc or power curve. I'd much rather just play 7 Wonders.

Fun drafting game. I enjoyed the spatial element a lot. I destroyed the competition on this one, winning by 9 points over 2nd place. There are some really cool synergies with the cards. I was able to get a good military engine going with many power reactors to counteract the cost. I will look into getting the expansion as well as the mini expansions here in the BGG store.

The spacial element in this game is awesome. You are not merely playing cards, you are assembling the rooms of a space station. Each room is thematic, as is the way different rooms interact. The tableau of cards you construct is really brought to life by the artwork. The mechanism of using the energy from your reactors to power rooms is a nice touch. Awesome drafting game.

Dreadfully dull.  The game's basically solitaire and offers a surprisingly shallow gameplay wherein you're only ever picking a card to earn the maximum points, and rarely caring about any card synergies or secondary resources.  It's bizarre that a game could mimic so many good mechanics from other games (the card draft in 7 Wonders is one of the reasons why it's firmly entrenched in my list of favorite games) and still be so boring I was struggling to pay attention to it.

I enjoyed my one play of this at BGG.con, but I'm not sure it would live up to many plays.  It's very similar to 7 wonders with card drafting in alternate directions for 4 rounds.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This game is a major table hog.  In a 4p game, we pretty much took up an entire 6 x 4 table.  Having played a ton of drafting games at this point, I found this one interesting, but mediocre in the end.  There are some interesting combos, but much like 7 wonders its hard to care about the person not next to you.  Doesn't do enough new over 7 wonders to be interesting enough, so I would rather just play 7 wonders.

RATING: 7
A drafting game that is often compared with 7 wonders. You build a ship with your cards. The decisions each seem to be easier to make with each draft, but there is more reading on the cards and the game seems more solitaire like as you are so busy reading your cards and you can't really read the other players cards that you make decisions solely on your ship you are building and not on other people's decision. Even less interaction than 7 Wonders. But not a bad game at all, I would just rather play 7 wonders (but nothing 'broken' about it!)

Jan 2014: initial impression: the Seven-Wonders-meets-Surburbia pitch I used was amazingly spot on. Like it, but didn't love it. Should be a good filler, though. Seemed even quicker than Seven Wonders once we got going.

Everyone says it's like 7 Wonders.  Really, the card passing & drafting mechanic is the only similarity.  It's more like Suburbia in the city building mechanic.

So if Suburbia and 7 Wonders had a baby in space, her name would be Among the Stars.  She's a fun baby: balanced, good resource management mechanics, and like 7 wonders, you really can't tell who's going to win until the end.

I played one 4-player game, took dead last but still had a blast. Good game!

Use card drafting to build the most efficient space station. Cards you draft are added as components to your station, adjacency and location is necessary for getting points, and on top of that manage resources to pay and power for new components.

My wife and I enjoy this game as it has very light card drafting and a nice spatial puzzle to build up your space station. My biggest complaint with this game is that the publisher has released far too much content and bloated the game. It is most likely my fault for buying the added content, but at this point I can't even get this game to the table because it takes 45 mins to straighten out what cards to play with, what to remove, etc. I like the game, but I would recommend just getting the base game and the Ambassador expansion and stopping there. Everything else is just bling that waters down a solid game.

// What's not fun about building a space station? This is
almost reminiscent of Sushi Go - drafting cards back and
forth and scoring points over three rounds. It's almost but
not quite as light, too. I like this game reasonably well
for the theme and the interaction between cards. It's fun

A forgettable card-drafting and tile (card) placement game.  It's largely multiplayer solitaire aside from trying to avoid passing good cards to your neighbor and competing over the (optional) objective cards.  The game play is similar to 7 Wonders, but the cards and font are smaller and hard to read at a distance.  I'm willing to try AtS again, but 7 Wonders feels more engaging and fun to me.

Possibly the worst game I played at Essen 2012. It looked nice but was pretty dire.

Card drafting game with a science fiction theme. I like the multiple routes to victory, but something doesn't quite mesh for me.

Also takes up a lot of table space, which is occasionally inconvenient.

Rather easy game to teach. Works very well with 3 to 4 players though it is still playable at 2. The game doesn't have any change in card pool over the 4 years, which leaves a slightly same-y feel during the game. However, it's only a minor quibble. The tile-laying aspect is a lot of fun and you get a real sense of tension trying to prevent your opponent from realizing their strategy. You also feel accomplished creating a beautiful space station. The artwork is phenomenal.

   While on the one hand Among the Stars has more depth than 7 Wonders, that too is a challenge for newer players who struggle over the amount of card-specific text, and the Alhambra-like approach to building your tableau.

This game is going to draw the obvious comparison to 7 Wonders, as it is a game where you look at a hand, use one card, and pass the rest to the left.

The difference between this and 7 Wonders is actually quite small.  You will use cards generally to score points or boost aspects of the space station you are building.  The main difference here is that positioning will sometimes matter.  Some cards need to be close to a power supply, or score more points for being near other cards.

Overall, if someone wanted to play this sort of drafting game, I wouldn't really have a preference between this and 7 Wonders.  They both offer pretty much the exact same thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
drafting game with a spatial element. There is no buildup of cards here (different cards for each specific round), a bunch of cards are just mixed together. Due to the amount of available cards, it can be a bit difficult for ppl new to the game to see the combos directly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Feels very similar to Quarantine, but it is twice the game.  In Q its auctioning to get tiles, in AtS its drafting.  I find the drafting much more satisfying for this style of game.  Using power plants and energy cubes to limit building distance for some tiles is interesting as well.  You can easily create synergies with each "faction".

More fun in general than Quarantine, but suffers from the same fault.  Its close scoring and the choices don't seem to matter since everyone is getting something every turn.

It has absolutely beautiful artwork and tasty cubes.  The only real detractor is the scoring board.  I can see why it is so compact to save space, but at the same time it feels really zany.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A more satisfying card drafting mechanic than 7 Wonders, a bit of additional interaction, and a neat spatial element that plays like a very simplified Suburbia.  Also really enjoy the variety as you only use a subset of goals, races, and Special Location cards each game.  Could play many times before you see all of the Special Locations which is a huge plus. 

The base game is slightly bland and you can tell an expansion would spice it up quite a bit.  Also recommend using the included optional Conflict Cards.

7 Wonders in space! The game is really awesome, especially when playing with two. However, there are 2 complaints that I have regarding this game.

1.) I am missing something like the conflict / war actions in 7 Wonders after each year. There are military buildings in the game, however they are just "another victory point resource", rather than a mechanism for "direct conflict" with the other players.

2.) The game takes VERY long to setup. You will have to come up with a custom insert or storage solution if you plan on playing this game more often. Especially when adding the expansions to your games!

If you like 7 Wonders and are not turned off by the space-theme you should definitely take a closer look at Among the Stars!

Setup really makes this game less welcome on our table... Dropped from 8.5 to 7...

I like the drafting mechanic in 7 Wonders (and also like it in other games like Fairy Tale too), so I was eager to try out Among the Stars. What I really, really liked about it was the spatial aspect of the game; you need to position the cards you draft in a grid in order to maximize your points. This was a really interesting feature and one I would love to see implemented in more (drafting) games! I also liked the end game scoring cards which everybody could concentrate on achieving, but still try to make as many points as possible during the game. 

I didn’t care much for the special powers of each of the races. Some of them definitely seemed better than others, but I do think you can adjust your strategy according to your special power which is neat as the games will play out differently each time. Speaking of this, only some of the “Special” buildings are shuffled into the draw pile which makes each game play out differently as you cannot count on a specific building being available in each game. This is almost always a plus in my book.

My main gripe with the game was the feeling of a lack of progress in the game. Sure, you get more and more cards on your tableau, but you have access to about the same buildings in each of the four years because the draw pile is shuffled randomly (the same goes for Fairy Tale). This is a huge difference compared to 7 Wonders in which the cards gradually get better and better, and I definitely think Among the Stars is moving in the wrong direction regarding this! In 7 Wonders, you feel like you are building up for something big during the game and then it all comes through in the third age. In Among the Stars, all of the years play out almost exactly the same as you don’t get more resources or anything; it’s just more of the same. 

Among the Stars is a good game, but if I should play a card drafting game I would suggest 7 Wonders most of the time though AtS would certainly be played a few times. If the spatial element of Among the Stars and the progressive element of 7 Wonders could be combined (yes, that would be hard work), I think we would have an awesome drafting game!

Rather abstract despite the sci-fi theme as you are merely positioning cards in order to score points according to how close or far they are to other cards or whether they are touching on one side, etc. At no point do you feel like you're building a space station. This could have been themed as anything. There is no interaction apart from the 'take-that' style grey cards which let you screw someone who isn't competing with you in a particular colour. The artwork is good but the cards are very busy, the text is too small and the scoretrack is badly designed. The game works similarly to 7 Wonders but there's nothing new here and I really didn't find it any fun.

*8* (Initial plays)
Very similar to 7 wonders but it has a spatial part to the game. I like it because it is a little heavier than 7 wonders and has a nice space theme. The base game comes in a way over-sized box, but I think this game screams for an expansion to add variety because I can see the cards getting a little repetitive. A new scoreboard is needed also, because the one provided is confusing. Overall, the game plays great.

RATING: 6
A drafting game that I think with the right group is probably a good game, but between the tile placement and trying to figure out which card gets you the most points each turn really dragged down our group. This became a 75 minute game with 4 players, which is far too long to be enjoyable for me. If all players can play quickly then I think this would be a good drafting game, but there are too many opportunities to get bogged down in finding the most points each round. Lastly, there is also no sense of progression since you can see the same cards over each of the 4 rounds. However, I do love seeing how your space station grows out in front of you and the little story you can have with all of your different locations.

Great card drafting game that feels like a more substantial game than 7 Wonders thanks to the added element of constructing your space station with the cards you draft. Special alien powers and varied card abilities make the game interesting and different every time.

RATING: 6
A fun twist/expanded take on the card-drafting genre. Unlike (for example) 7 Wonders, which is all about the draft, here you have to connect previously played cards to each other in a grid-like fashion. Some cards will give you bonus points depending on what other cards are  nearby, and other cards require 'power' from a nearby source before they can even be placed.

A couple of criticisms - there isnt any real sense of buildup as the game progresses (all the cards are shuffled into one great big stack, regardless of power/cost) and the spatial element isn't as important as it should be. However, it's a pretty fun game overall.

RATING: 7
A light tactical drafting game which will draw comparisons the 7 wonders. The big difference with ATS is public scoring as the game proceeds as opposed to pure end-game scoring like you have in 7W.

pros:

quick play time
fun addition to drafting mechanic - card proximity & adjacency
pity point mechanic ( take 2 points if you give an opponent 1 point)
races provide some variety without being game-breaking

cons:

many cards require knowing how many of each color each station has. this leads to a lot having of counting and recounting your opponents tableaus. a good way to fix this would be a standing component where each player could update the cards in their tableau.

A drafting game like 7 Wonders, this one requires you to strategically place tiles as you build your space station in order to get maximal bonus points. However here you have to make the most of the 10 credits you get per round, or you'll be forced to sell pieces instead of buy them. Each player has a racial ability and all will be shooting to claim each game's objectives.

I have been having a hard time organizing this game to make it easier to set up.  1 bag for goals, 1 for special tiles, 1 for basic tiles, 1 for  power plants but wait some races have special power plants, bag for starting power plants but wait some more of those for alternate races.

Love the game but when i crack open the box there are lots of bags with cards and it is confusing.  I think I would make the starting power plants in cardboard and make the goal cards a different size to help differentiate some of the parts.

I think in 2015 that board games have largely progressed beyond pay 3 money for 5 points with +2 points if you've been building blue cards.

I mean you can literally see a subpar prototype in the final game. Talk about sucking you right out of any sort of thematic mood you might have been trying to be in. 

True, I do not naturally like the space theme but this is an outdated family style game. I gave up a happy play of Grand Austria Hotel for this? Seriously.

It has been awhile since I have played anything rated this highly that was this bad.

As a fan of 7 Wonders and Science Fiction, it's no surprise I'm a fan of this game.

From the first time I played it, I knew I wanted it in my own collection. The drafting and constructing aspects I like so much from 7 Wonders have been combined with actually building something visible.

7 Wonders is more abstract, with your cards simply placed in front of you, but in Among the Stars you're actually building the space station, so the physical location of the card you're building matters.

Whether it's 7W or AtS, I'm always up for a game.

I have played [thing=133473][/thing], [thing=13823][/thing], and [thing=68448][/thing] before, but I enjoy this one more than all of those. This game has many paths to victory, and I really enjoy the spatial aspect of playing the cards. 

Being able to trade in cards you maybe don't want but also don't want others to have to get resources is also an interesting mechanic that I enjoy about the game.

"Look at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us." We need more stuff in our station! Why is there a restaurant next to a giant turret?

The game feels somewhat similar to 7 Wonders. But it lacks the sense of progress/advancement/build-up that 7 Wonders has in the sense that with each of the 4 years (Ages) the cards from the same shuffled deck. 7W Ages the cards get more powerful and more expensive, in AtS the cards next age will be potentially the same as last. So while your station grows larger and more valuable, the cards do not become more interesting. Also, at the start of each year/age you get another 10 coins, so you have no need to manage your money like in 7W to ensure you have enough in hand at the end/start of an age to buy an amazing can't-pass card in your first hand. In fact, with 10 new coins at the start of each year, you are assured to be able to buy cards from at least the first 2 if not 3 hands of the round. Like variable Wonder powers, there are variable Alien powers, which are cool. The game has a nice component of forcing you to plan out the construction/layout of your station to maximize card scores. Examining opponents' stations is important but more difficult than in 7W because of card/text size. A decent and fun game. I would be curious if the promos and expansions improve the game. I am wondering what it was limited to 4 players.

RATING: 7.1
Build a space station on the basis of cards. Simple rules, which are unfortunately too simple once the extras are introduced (the races and the disputes), because as of that moment player order becomes important. And there are no rules at all on player order. The special abilities of the different races are unbalanced. If players are left free choice, some races will never be chosen. The game is probably best when played in its basic form.
As far as depth of the theme is concerned, Spacestation by FryxGames is clearly superior, because in Among the stars the only purpose the modules (cards) of your space station serve is to mark points and sometimes gain some money or energy at the moment they are placed. In Spacestation you can activate many cards in order to use the modules by means of worker placement. And there are event cards which enrich the game play.
Due to the mechanism of passing your hand of cards to your neighbour after picking one to use yourself, the game is sometimes compared to 7 Wonders. Once again, 7 Wonders is a richer game, because many of the cards that you build are used in order to perform new actions. This is really lacking in Among the Stars. You can build all the military modules you want, you will still be a sitting duck when other players come stealing your points by means of their superior gardening...

Card drafting game that trades the sense of card/civilization progression of 7 Wonders with a light sense of spacial 2D tableau building. The progression comes from looking for combos that work with the layout that you create with the cards you choose.

Bought at BGG fleamarket 2014, played many times previously. 

Great spin on 7 Wonders-style hand-passing. Your cards all become part of this sprawling, modular space station that's perfectly thematic (the backstory in the manual is great fun, too). The station becomes this giant victory point machine at the end of the game - if you built it correctly, that is. 

There's even less player interaction than 7 Wonders, though. A successful player keeps his eyes on his opponents' stations, but the stations don't fire lasers at each other or anything. There is a variation where you limit your building space to the shape of the table, so there's some potential there. Haven't tried it that way.

I have played the game with some of the expansions and found they didn't add much. The ambassador cards in particular had a whimsical quality that I felt strayed outside of the theme (one has the obligatory Tom Vasel references, and gives you points for how many board games you own). Your mileage may vary.

I was excited to get into this game - kingdom-building games have always been fun to me, so making my own spacecraft caught my attention. While fun to play for the fun of combining the different card effects to your advantage, the game tends to petter off towards the end and the conclusion consistently falls flat.

This is primarily due to the fact that the thematic connection of building your spaceship is low (looking at the grid of cards in front of you, with its myriad of random parts, rarely feels satisfying.)

Kickstarter picked up by a friend in Essen 2014.
A slightly upgraded, space themed version of 7 wonders. You draft square cards (tiles), which represent 5 different types of space station modules, and place them in front of you but, unlike 7 wonders, it matters where you place them, ultimately making your own unique station. Some modules give you points on placement and some (yellow backed) give you points in the end and somewhat guide your strategy throughout the game. There are also public objectives you can follow and different races with unique special powers.

If you want more conflict you could also include dispute cards in game and attack other player points directly.

With base game it's only up to 4 players and up to 6 with Expanding the Alliance expansion, which we have yet to try.

:star::nostar::nostar:

[b]Update:[/b] Ambassadors expansion adds unnecessary complexity to the game and I would not recommend at first.

Draft small square cards and play them in a grid. Most cards earn extra points if their placement fulfills certain criteria such as being next too green cards etc.

For a long time, I wanted to add this game into my collection (and I still might), but I knew someone who had it and it was just a matter of time before I could get my hands dirty with it.  The itch is scratched for now, however.

At any rate, Among the Stars is great and works very well with the drafting mechanic.  On my first play, I managed to grab every turret in the deck... so I kind of threw the score out of whack haha.  Even if I hadn't managed that, though, planning your layouts and more importantly, choosing -when- to do things is key in this game.  Because of this, I don't feel it auto-plays itself and leaves a nice heft in the strategy department.

Fun game.  There are always good options, and the risks aren't as risky as they can be in seven wonders.  The BGG user two player variant is great too!

My only complaint about the game is also one of its strengths - the point caps on cards and limiting certain cards to one per player keep the scores pretty tight.  It also makes it so there are a lot of good options, but rarely great options.  I rarely feel the need to deprive other players of cards due to the scoring restrictions on them.  What this adds up to for me is a lack of excitement when playing the game because everything seems so extremely balanced.  It might just be I'm bad at the game though...

2015-07-31 : This is the kind of game you have to play multiple times so you know what cards are in there and what combos are possible. Consequently the first play was kind of a crapshoot, but that was to be expected. A point is deducted because you can tell play was made simultaneous in a later stadium of the design, while the order in which players decide things does matter. This made making up house-rules a necesssity on the first play and this should not happen. And would it have killed them to make the text 2 font sizes bigger ? Good layout though and players are constantly engaged, so overall a good game. 4 plays in, another very close game and I'm upgrading this to a 8

7 Wonders meets Carcassonne!  Unfortunately though, it doesn't have either the depth or interaction of those two games.  It would rate higher if it had preceded them, but there's nothing really new here and although there's little downtime, I find draughting games go a bit slow - at least until new players have learnt the cards.  The art is good, but the card iconography is a tad small and some of the initial cards should have been colour-coded as pre-game set-up and sorting can be an irritating chore.  I find the game thematic enough, but the theme is, dare I say on this site, a bit too much geek!  And as gameplay is a little simple, I think I'm just not in the demographic this appeals to.  I can think of a 1/2 dozen better themes than a starbase (or a farm).  Why does a starbase have a bank or energy exchange or a shopping bazaar?  I like the unique objectives and alien race abilities, though am not convinced they're all equally balanced.  The scoring track is fragile, but the energy cubes really cool.  Absent of any 7W "age decks", I find most cards and hence most games tend to just playout the same and it didn't hit any high notes for me.  I've tried the Ambassadors expansion, but this game is fine without any of them, as too much stuff tends to wreck draughting games.

It's an OK game, but too tactically simple for me, too geeky, has too large a table footprint and basically, I enjoy both Carcassonne and 7 Wonders a whole lot more (especially as military effects are mandatory in 7W). Among the Stars is fun if nothing else and I'd play it again, but as I don't plan to keep it, I doubt I will.

RATING: 5
I see what they were going for here, and it’s not a bad idea (crossing 7 Wonders with Suburbia or maybe Alhambra), but they forgot (or rather, specifically minimized) player interaction. While there are some neat ideas here – I especially like how you have to take some turns to reload on energy cubes so you have options to build on subsequent turns – I find 7 Wonders much more enjoyable for the way you compete on military and leech off your neighbors. You also have a sense of progression from deck to deck that isn't present here. And understand that I’m no big 7 Wonders fan either, but given the two I’d much rather play that one hands down. The spatial considerations are the only advantage I see here.

Here you occasionally look up to see if passing your neighbor a tile is a bad idea, but for the most part you’re just maximizing your own path. After a couple plays of seeing all the tiles and trying out the different paths, I’m not sure what the lure to revisit the game will be.  Oh right - expansions.

Among the Stars scratches an itch most drafting games don’t really do for me, drafting is a neat concept but in a lot of games it feels flat where, you draft, calculate combos and score VPs, while it does all of that the added combination of a spatial element and the intriguing theme of building a space station makes this game a definite winner for me in the genre.

Among the Stars is a fantastic longer-haul drafting game, the only thing I could hope for is a little more direct player interaction but there are expansions to be explored!

P.S. Make sure you have A LOT of table space!

This is my favorite drafting game. I like the geometric puzzle of where to put the cards I draft because it adds a layer to the straight drafting mechanic that goes beyond simple set collection. Fantastic entry to the genre. My only complaint is the number of cards that rely on other card copies coming up in order to work. It really limits how many different cards you can play with at one time.

This game has everything I am interested in. It plays under 60 minutes, it is easy to teach and learn, it offers a multiplicity of decisions to be made each turn.

The only drawback is that this game requires a lot of space on the table. Also I am "meh" about the race tokens. Some of them are clearly better than others. Some are useless and unplayable.

Can't see myself playing 7 Wonders over this.  The theme is strong with this one, and compared to 7 Wonders is more friendly to losing players and has a very unique spacial aspect to it.  Can play relaxed or competitive.  Easy to pick up, extremely well-balanced.  Since everyone plays at the same time, you're always engaged.  If you're waiting for other people, you can glimpse at what they're making to plan your choices.  Only catch is that you need a large open area to play since it takes up a lot of room.  Highly recommend.

7 Wonders-ultra-lite in spaaaaaaaaaaace - with tile placement.

DESIRABILITY: Don't need access to it.

Rating history: 7|5

1st play: 7. Oct/14. Drafting space station cards in order to create a space station. I was afraid it would be heavy and clunky: quite the opposite, as the game is quite light and quick to play. If you own 7 Wonders, why buy this? Art is good, it's even easier to play (I think) than 7 Wonders, and I like tile placement games. It is really light though and the scoring fairly low and symmetrical. (During the game I kept looking to see what my points per coin were. If I saw $3 = $5 or better, I'd play it. I won by a landslide.)

2nd play: 5. Oct/14. Won my second game as handily as the first, but tension or fun for me. Just not enough meat on these bones. Each card comes down to a simple calculation of points per coin, and most cards are simple variations of the ratios from 1:1 to 7:4, etc.

Played 2 times.
3p - 1x - Worked well enough.
4p - 1x - Seemed well balanced with 4.

I've only played twice but I've owned it for a while now. I like the strategic placement of tiles to build your station. The downside is that scoring happens after every placement, which can be a bit fiddly and slow down the game. There's also no progression of ages like there is with 7 wonders, so a card that is powerful in the last round might come out in the first and be useless.

Nagyon hasonlít a 7w-re, tényleg nem ok nélkül méri mindenhol hozzá. Nekem kevésbé tetszett mint a 7w, mert a sok apróbetűs szöveg eléggé megnehezíti a játékot. A többiek bázisának figyelését pedig egyenesen meglehetetleníti. Így viszont sokkal szoliterebbé válik, mint az 7w, ráadásul a választás se olyan pörgős. Ebben a kategóriában nekem a pont a gyors, egyszerű játékmenet a csábító, de ezt ez nem nyújtja. 
Ettől függetlenül, egy jó draftolós játék. Akiket a fenti nem zavar, azoknak mindenképp ajánlott.

7 Wonders in space sounds about right. Apart from a few tweaks here and there (which doesn't necessarily mean they don't make a difference) the major change is that there is an spatial component in building your space station. Where you place your cards is important, and some cards can be much more useful with the right station layout.

Just like its source of inspiration Among the Stars works well enough but doesn't excite. That all 4 years are played with the same cards is probably a net negative. The balancing of some cards seems a little off, as with the right combination of race and locations they can become excessively strong. Aggressive mode is no real improvement, either. While a bit more interactivity certainly doesn't hurt the game and the short-term vs. long-term, scoring vs. damage control considerations it adds are quite interesting, the effect of targeted attacks on players ruins much of the station building optimization.

This game strikes me as Irondale in space. It has a number of shared mechanics with 7 wonders, but feels vastly different.

Thankfully, much of this occurs when the card is placed or when the game ends.

An excellent 7 wonders style drafting game with the addition of a spatual element. I never enjoyed 7 wonders at high player counts and this game keeps it small while adding in mechanics I enjoy 

There is a lot to think about and depth to this game, especially once you add in the ambassador expansions so you have another core action to take and you aren't seeing the same base locations every game.

I think the race powers are kind of lame in this game, could take it or leave it. Also do not play with disputes 

I want to play this one more and try out more combos. Could bump up a rating once I dive deeper into this one

Like many have already said, it's in the same vein as 7 Wonders. Good game and ended up being mega easy to teach too. Everything made sense and I thought it played quicker compared to some of the comments I had read. I think it would be the perfect gateway or kid friendly drafting game. 
The desicions each round just didn't seem tough enough. There was either one card that was an obvious choice or a few that weren't near as good as the others. It's very tactical, and that would be fine if only the choices were more difficult to make. It plays over 4 rounds. I figured after the first round or so that some sort of strategy would start to develop; but not so much. The cards don't really change from round to round. They're all shuffled together and are randomly dealt. So you could end of having a bunh of the same one in one round. It would be better if the game progressed in a way similiar to 7 Wonders does. For example with the resources being heavy early on than tapering off as the game goes on. 
The objectives added a little bit more planning to the game. Not much though.Maybe I was hoping for a little bit more of a gamers game than it turned out to be. 
The aggressive mode adds one more card(conflict card) to each round. In a nut shell if you got one of them and it fits what you've already built compared to someone else, than you would obviously want to play it. 
Different enough that I could see someone owning both 7 Wonders and this for playing with different groups. In the end, I like 7 Wonders better. It feels more streamlined and has tougher decisions. Along with the Leaders expansion that helps to add some strategy from the word go

This never captured me. I thought it would invalidate 7 Wonders, but I didn't find any of the cards that interesting. All of them are variations of "score 3-4 points for meeting this condition".

Players are competing to build the best space station. Players draft cards/locations they can attach to their station. Each has either an 'instant' or 'delayed' reward and/or player interaction.

A tableau-building card game with drafting similar to 7 Wonders. Players add cards to their space stations to gain points and create possible combos. The only interaction with others is that passive-aggressive kind, which is pretty uninteresting. Not a bad game, just kind of boring.

It's an okay game, but I prefer Suburbia where most tiles have a synergy with something else. There ain't enough synergy in the game and it is thus less fun than Suburbia. I don't like the one shot bonus, I would make most tiles permanent bonus like Suburbia where when someone plays a tile, you need to look at your entire station to see what bonus you get, and then the other's stations too.

But it is still fun, though I would never buy it.

Summary: A pretty game with a cool theme, that has no meat to it.

The game consists of placing a card and scoring it, placing a card and scoring it, placing a card and scoring it, placing a card and scoring it, building another reactor, placing a card and scoring it, placing a card and scoring it and so on. There's money and there's energy to manage, and that's the entire game. No other elements, no interaction with other players (other than utterly random aggression cards in the advanced game), no card selection, no impactful side effects, no subtleties. It's draw-and-play.

Some of the very, very few mechanisms of this game somewhat reminded me of Glen More (the manner in which the station is built up, certain elements referring to edge-connected cards). I highly recommend that game to everybody who gives this one high marks.

RATING: 6.5
This is basically a very simplified "7 Wonders" with a welcome spatial element. It's easier to teach to newbies and I prefer the space theme (reminiscent of "Babylon 5"), but although I have enjoyed the game thus far, I have to admit that the design isn't as good.

The cards are much less interesting, generally giving some fixed victory points, plus bonus points based on the presence or position of other cards in your station. Also, as there is a single deck for the whole game, there isn't a real sense of progression, and you will often have cards in the first round that would be much better later in the game. Finally, all cards in hand are used, meaning that there isn't much of a choice in the last turn of each round: either you can pay the cost of the single card that is passed to you or you can't (and must discard it for money or a power reactor).

All things considered, it's still a decent game. The spatial positioning does add to the gameplay. The problem is that it copied "7 Wonders" so blatantly that the comparisons are inevitable - and it loses.

I really like this one, and go back and forth as to whether I like it more than 7 Wonders. I enjoy the space theme and I really enjoy the mechanics. I feel like I get to get right into the fun, rather than waiting for a later age to bring out the big stuff. The only downside is I so far I only have played with 2 players, and I think the game would be stronger with more people.

As someone who likes the idea of card drafting but hated the lack of depth in 7 Wonders, I'd looked forward to this one - but half way through I'd lost the will to live. Too long, with the same boring set of tiles throughout four identical rounds, it's boredom game-ified.

Among the Stars (AtS), while not being anything that is highly innovative, still feels somewhat fresh in that drafted cards are utilized in a tableau in which spatial arrangement matters (get it? spatial?): you're building a space ship, and each part matters. Comparisons here to 7 Wonders is inevitable here, given that 7 Wonders has become the poster child for drafting games (a position that Fairy Tale never quite fully occupied it seems). Wherein 7W feels like a resource acquisition then VP grinding through picking a strategic path (that is already laid out for you), AtS feels a lot more tactical in that it is no longer a case of having or not having a card: many cards require you to have laid out particular placements for them to *really* cash out. Accordingly, while this won't ever be a favorite game of mine (as I usually don't dig games in which card drafting is the primary and almost exclusive mechanic), it might be one of my preferred ones within the pure drafting genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm not a huge 7 Wonders fan but it has its appeal, and this game has largely the same appeal. The main difference here is that after the draft you place your cards out on an ever expanding personal display which represents your space station. Some cards will reward you for being next to or far away from other cards or card types, so you'll try to optimize that. Anyway, not really my thing but not bad at all.

It's not a bad game, it's just that i would never play this again.. ever.
You draft tiles & then add one tile to your space station each turn.. that's it.. oh, yeah VPs.. plenty.. for every tile.. excited..?

The theme just seemed to insinuate more.. like combat, ressources, conflict.. man was i mistaken..

If you love tiles, sci-fi, building things & dislike player interaction & conflict you'll like this one.

I love it. Setup time, especially with some expansions thrown in, is a little tedious, so it doesn't hit the table as often as I wanted it to.

But I like the theme, the simplicity, the easy-going gameplay (which can get meaner with the Ambassadors expansions). And yes, I prefer it over 7 Wonders ;)

Expansions I like the most: all mix-in Special/Promo locations, Blueprints, Events, Objectives. Ambassadors up the competition and player interaction a bit, which is okay, but sometimes I prefer not to have it. Spaceships from the Revival stand-alone game are nice. Not sure about the Advisors: we sometimes/often forgot to set them. 
Sometimes we even play without Special Alien Race Powers (not an expansion, they are in the base set).

Perhaps a best sci-fi themed game I have. I simply love this game. It has this similar card drafting mechanic than 7 Wonders have (I think it's a brilliant mechanic, forces you to really think what cards to use and when and what cards to surely remove from the game in order to stop other players from having them). Also the way you build your own space station from your cards and the whole building system and rules is highly enjoyable. There's different ways to win this game. Also components look awesome and I like the fact that the developers are using original world in this, with their own races and planets etc. instead of using some already existing sci-fi universe, like Star Wars or Star Trek. They have created extensive backstories to all of these races.

RATING: 6
Glad I didn't jump on the bandwagon just because it was a "step up from 7 wonders".

I definitely enjoyed the tile laying part of the game but this game really suffers from the lack of interaction. 7W as it is, has little interaction. But I still enjoy it for what little it offers (and I enjoy the drafting and symbology A LOT).

This game needs more refinement. It is streamlined and very fun to play but I'm playing a game to have fun with a group! Not each of us having fun alone together!!!

Even the take-that was hardly felt and whatever cards that required cooperation from other players, lacked the effect and oomph it needed to bring it up a notch.

RATING: 7
(03/15/2014) Comment based on one play.

This is a dumbed-down version of [i]7 Wonders[/i] and [i]Glen More[/i] mashed together, that overstays its welcome by thirty minutes.

The major beef I have with this design is that there are no separate decks for the four "years" in this game, like the three ages in [i]7 Wonders[/i]. There are no prerequisites, other than having the necessary money and sometimes power cube(s) to place a card. Cards that require power cubes must be within range of "reactors", which can be built by discarding a card during the 24 drafts that happen during the game. That means there is no future planning, or anticipation of getting more sophisticated cards later on; you may get a powerful card right off the bat. There is no "build up" period, like in [i]7 Wonders[/i]. So, I could build a 8 VP "Experimental Weapon" within two card drafts? How realistic is that? There is also virtually no interaction with the other players, other than through the passing of cards and alien powers. The left-neighbor/right-neighbor resource-purchase binding of [i]7 Wonders[/i] is missing, because players get all of their resources up front, or they generate themselves. Thus, this is essentially multi-player solitaire. 

There are five different colors associated with the cards, much like in [i]7 Wonders[/i]--almost literally a one-to-one rip off, with a single letter code associated with it: Red (M)-Military; Green (D)-Diplomatic; Yellow (B)-Business; Blue (A)- Administrative; and Purple (R)-Recreation. Everyone scores VP with every card draft, much like a "point salad" game, based on the VP shown on each card. Some cards have weak VP when placed, but have "delayed" capabilities, which grants extra VP at the end of the game if conditions on the card are met. Some cards offer a lot of VP upfront, but are accordingly more expensive. It is simply a matter of either selecting a card that gives you max VP now, or setting up a string of cards for more VP later on. Adjacency and proximity to similar colored cards in key, and thus forces players to be creative in placement of cards, which is similar in feel to the placement of village tiles in Glen More.

The artwork is wonderfully evocative of a futuristic space station environment, along the lines of [i]Babylon 5[/i], but perhaps darker and more Gothic. Play is quick, just like [i]7 Wonders[/i]. Rules seem straightforward. Still, the gameplay seems far more simplified when compared to [i]7 Wonders[/i], much like [i]Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game[/i] is to [i]Dominion[/i]. So, as far as card drafting games go, this is okay, bordering on "meh". This could have been a much better game IF there were four card stacks, with each year giving progressively more advanced cards, with prerequisites from previous years, instead of drawing from as single, randomly shuffled deck--the four years are pretty much the same. The alien powers are nice, but don't add too much asymmetry to make it interesting. I'll play it again, but I won't be too excited about it--it seems like I would just collect a lot of like-colored cards and bunch them together and score big. Initial rating: "7".

The core drafting mechanic makes this a swift-playing game with little down time, even for high player counts.

WHERE you will put a card matters just as much as WHICH card you will pick.

This game is fantastic. A really great drafting game that, even through it's mechanics, is quite thematic. Building your space station is a fun and interesting endeavor. I own both the Ambassadors expansion and Expanding The Alliance A.K.A. Promo cards, but haven't played the game with them yet. The base game is very solid and I have only heard that Ambassadors really fleshes out the game even more.

Even though I like the theme and premise of this game greatly, I still prefer 7 Wonders more, but both are quite unique in there own right to have both in your collection. A Great game that plays quick, and is easy to teach.

This is another game of city building by tile-laying with text on the tiles. It reminded me strongly of City Tycoon but is also reminiscent of Infinite City.

A solid and straightforward tableau builder with drafting and difficult resource management. Checks a lot of boxes for me. Does not feel as much like 7 Wonders as most people believe it does, mainly because you only draw from only one deck. Hate drafting is both easier (just pump out a reactor) and more difficult (oh crap but I really need to build those for my objective) at the same time.

It is not perfect. The base game only plays 4, the disputes are wishy-washy luck draws that can be game-breaking, and objective/racial power combos range from "you will never finish this" to "easy street." Highly suggest drafting races to mitigate.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

I went through a notable trial in order to acquire this game. I purchased it on kickstarter and there were delays. I used a forwarding service to ship from the States to Japan, who literally left a massive box-cutter mark all the way down the game's box cover, and weeks of emails later I finally received compensation for the damage. Phew. With all that said I can say that it was worth it. 

This is a smart, smooth and quick game that does more in 30 minutes than most other games can hope for. 
I find drafting a little stale in most games, but here I always feel like I have exciting choices to make, rather than just the optimal choice, because of the spacial puzzle. There is always a new way to expand your station or plan for the future using what you have in your hand. The constant flow of points, with several station expansions that also allows cumulative scoring based on their location, really take the game to the next level. Definitely worth checking out if you want more meat out of a drafting game.

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Plays quick and smoothly even with two-players.
- More of a brain-burn that most drafting games. 
- Creates a really satisfying feeling after all is said and done, and you survey the station you yourself have built. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- The setup time is ridiculous for a card game, especially with the expansions (its pretty much worth it though).
- I really am at a lost to think of any other cons other than it's still a little light if you want something heavier.

This is a quick, easy drafting game. There is a slight spatial element which keeps things sort of interesting, but every card is just worth like 3-6 points and so you can usually just look at your hand, see which card is worth the most points, and pick it. That's a bit of an oversimplification, since some cards will be worth more based on other cards, but it's still a fairly simple evaluation. Given this I'm not exactly sure why I'm rating it even as high as I have, but I was enjoying myself and he game was quick.

Among the Stars copies much from 7 Wonders, but does enough differently that it stands out on its own. Managing credits and card positioning is a tough skill to master, especially given the randomizing of the deck during game setup. That randomization might make the game a bit more luck-dependent than it should be, but experienced players who know the cards should still be able to put themselves in the best position to win.

Among the Stars is different enough from its spiritual predecessor that having both in one's collection is not a crazy thought - and that's a pretty good compliment to give a game like this.

Kind of an interesting drafting game in which you're building a space station.  Clearly, the best way to win is, "not the way I played my first game."  I would like to think I learned something and could do better next time.  Update: I didn't learn.  This is a game that can be bad for you if you go for in-game scoring because people think you're winning and they target you.  Then it becomes political when you have to convince people you're not winning even though you have the most points on the scoreboard.

"7 Wonders" wanna-be but unlike 7 Wonders (base game only) it goes on too long for what it is.  Also needless "take that" elements (though not overwhelming).

Amazing art, theme and universe is fun and expansive. Rules are simple and very graspable. Easy to teach, fast to learn. Tons and tons of replay-ability and a fast paced drafter that doesnt get old. The worst aspect of the game is the box does not come with any kind of insert or separators. The lack of availability and difficulty to obtain was equally as irritating but the game is worth the time money and effort in tracking down.

I love this game, but it just doesn't get played as much as I would like because of the setup. I have all of the expansions, and it can easily take 20 minutes to get the game set up and going even with my Broken Token organizer!

RATING: 8.5
Like castles of mad king ludwig and 7 wonders had a baby. Much easier to manage than the castle bits and the setup is really easy.

The power management in the space station is not very complicated and adds quite a bit of theme to the game as you have to make sure that the areas you're connecting to have sufficient power to actually run.

Expansions add a bit more stuff to do and Revival adds an actual 2 player mode to the game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2014)

I knew beforehand that Among the Stars is a drafting game, however when I read the rules, I found the game to be VERY similar to  7 Wonders. Two of the main actions are the same (to build the card or to discard the card to get 3 credit/coins) , the main difference is that Among the Stars has an spatial element (it matters where you play your cards), other than that the games are nearly identical. I’m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but I was certainly expecting something different. 

I really like the Sci-Fi theme, sadly the back story is very weak. I, somewhat,  dislike the square cards, not sure why. Good art and components, love the energy cubes.

The game plays fast and it is very easy to teach.
 
Bottom line, I’m not sure if I’m keeping the game, I need to play it with my GF to see if she likes it (she loves 7 wonders) . To be fair I enjoyed my plays of Among the Stars, It is a solid game, but it fails to really excite me (and I bought all the expansions :S). For now I prefer it over 7 wonders but that’s only because I played 7 wonders to death. I think 7 Wonders is the better game with more interesting decisions. If you like 7 Wonders, you will certainly like Among the Stars. I have yet to play the aggressive mode.

Current Rating: 6.0

I have played this game once, but I loved it! As far as Among The Stars vs. 7 Wonders, at first I had no idea which I liked better. However, after playing 7 Wonders more, I am coming to the conclusion that I believe I like Among The Stars more than 7 Wonders, for a few reasons:
#1 reason: The space theme: Yes, I know that there are tons of space themed games now-a-days, but hey... you can see why, people love space games!... Which leads me to:
#2 reason: The spatial element in play in ATS: In Among The Stars, you could hypothetically play the exact same cards every single game and yet generate different victory point amounts every game solo because you position those cards differently as part of your spaceship which you are building. For example, there are also different conditions on the cards which tell you, for instance, that if you build X card within 3 spaces of your main star reactor, you can get even more points for that one card.
The 3rd reason why I like Among The Stars better than 7 Wonders is because I believe the game is more balanced. There are many different types of cards, like in 7 Wonders, but as far as I know there are not 1 or 2 dominant strategies to win the game (the spatial element of the game helps with this, as well).
My 4th reason which I prefer Among The Stars is because of the variety of how cards score points. There are 2 different types of cards, point scoring-wise: (1) Cards which score points immediately and do not score again (the normal white captioned background cards); (2) Cards that do not score any points immediately, but score all of their points at the END of the game (the cards with the yellow captioned background). This element of how many cards a player has that have already scored vs. the number of cards for which a player is deferring points for at the end of the game can make the current score of a game deceptive. Someone who has played mostly all cards which score at the end of the game could be way behind on the score track - which could lead to players giving a point to him/her every once in a while (there is a card in which you give yourself 2 points and another player 1), but by scoring their points at the end of the game, they may have actually been secretly in the lead and planned it that way the entire time.
Those are the reasons why I think that Among The Stars kicks 7 Wonders's butt!
I would like to acquire this game so that I can play it more often (I am not saying I won't play 7 Wonders anymore, but I would definitely play Among The Stars more!)

Ok, I have played this a couple of times now. The good first: Artwork is fantastic, the length is perfect, there are decisions to be had and because of the simultanious drafting it is never boring and you always feel involved. The races and goals are nice additions and it is great to see your space station expanding. However, it doesn't really excite me either. So I would rate it on the same level as Dominion, except a little better since you don't have to wait a long time before you get to play your part of the solitaire. Could be better if there was more strategy, like if you had a reserve you could shove cards into instead of playing one on your turn. Someone will probably come along and houserule the game better. Oh, and it will probably be better as a 3 player game, since more cards will get back to you from you starting hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
2-4 player drafting game with theme of spaceship construction. Provides a tight game with constant decisions to be made.

Pros: 

- some synergy between cards.

- players have to watch their direct neighbours actions as closely as their own - resulting in constant choices to be made.

Cons: 

- swallows table space (I'm not sure I've seen a table capable of a 4 player game). 

- overly long game play. By the time the game ends I'm normally bored and quietly glad it's finished.

- feel that too much luck is involved in the draw process. The effect is that games are more tactical and less strategic. This leads to less diverse outcomes, with ships produced at the end of the game broadly similar (e.g. can't adopt an outright Military or say Leisure/Commerce strategy, as cards drafted will force you to have a bit of everything on your ships.

After getting this to the table a little more, I’ve got to say that it just keeps getting better and better for me. Just such a solid little card drafter. Art is good and the graphic design (while not amazingly pretty) is efficient, clear and readable. Maybe best of all, it plays well with 2 players (with the draw/discard 2-player variant), a no-go for vanilla 7 Wonders (even Duel, which plays great, doesn’t FEEL like a traditional drafter and is a lot “meaner”). Only real pain is having to re-build the deck each game but that’s a fairly minor annoyance.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A decent, although ultimately unimpressive game. Scarcity seems to have been the driving factor behind its sudden popularity, because the gameplay is fairly run of the mill.

Works as a 'next-step' from 7 Wonders insofar as you draft the cards that you build, which can actively contribute points to your score - whether immediately or at the end of the game - or can have you offering deals with opponents, or comparing your stations for the sake of points. The biggest difference though is the spatial element of building your space station; this is a tile laying game after all. Some cards also require you to be within a certain number of steps from a power source, or from another specific colour/named tile in order to score points.

It all sounds like something that would be right up my alley, but somehow playing it doesn't translate into any sense of excitement. It feels like a slog through drafting, and occasionally playing a tile that offers you no benefit - but *might* give you a point at the end of the game because it's a specific colour. I wished that it would have had a mechanic similar to Suburbia, where placing a tile could cause a cascade of actions to fire; instead the tile either activates immediately, or at the end of the game.

It's by no means a bad game - the theme is great, and having unique player powers is a big plus for me (although some of the 'powers' are pretty mundane). And it certainly plays better when using the grey background conflict cards, which allow you to pull back on the reins of opponents that are getting too far ahead. But ultimately there doesn't feel like there's any crescendo with this game; you start by placing tiles, and then you keep placing until there are no more tiles to play, and then the game is over. Maybe if the tiles interacted more within your space station, it'd feel like you were actually building something grand as you approached the end.

Among the Stars transports 7 Wonders to space, modifies a few elements such as four rounds of 6 cards and only money-based acquisitions instead of resource-driven play and adds a spatial component of building up a space station. The need for resource management is reduced as each player gets a fixed income each round, thereby eliminating an interesting element from the game. With the optional conflict cards limited direct attacks are  introduced. Luckily, conflicts can be prepared for to a certain degree by avoiding monocultures but for me this option adds nothing worthwile to gameplay. Tension of drafts is less intensive and the whole game feels less focussed as there's no such clear specialization reward as in 7 Wonders.
While I would play Among the Stars again, I see little reason to choose it over 7 Wonders.

I would've bought 7 Wonders if it wasn't for ATS - I prefer the space theme and tile laying aspects of this game over 7 Wonders - also drafting :)

The only down side to this game is the setup time and clean up afterwards (since you want everything in order for the next game) - It would be much better if setting up a new game wouldn't cost so much time. Gameplay itself, setting and theme is nice and funny to look at in the end (since you create very different space stations based on what tiles you get). I like it a lot, wished it had less downtime to set up/clean up.

Mechanically really close to 7 Wonders with added tile laying element. The feeling of the game is also really reminiscent to Race for the Galaxy. Lots of races, objectives and special buildings guarantee replayability. Due to the drafting mechanism there aren't any game breaking cards and therefore it's really difficult to really gain an advantage over other players.

Very good drafting game. The spatial element is a fun addition that appeals to people, draws them in.

7 Wonders has reached a much wider audience for several reasons (like the easier iconography, better components, etc) but when it comes down to gameplay... I'm not sure which I prefer? Think it comes down to mood, both are good games :p
I think it depends on the group. If your group size fluctuates, go for 7 Wonders. If you have a steady number of players, AtS will offer more variability.
Setup wise it's kinda the same. You can use some variant rules to heavily cut down on AtS's setup time though.

Medium to light drafting/tableau building game. I see this game as an amalgamation of 7 wonders and Alhambra. The theme is pretty thin, even with the races. I only played the beginner game and I'm sure this one gets a bit better with more moving parts, but for what it is I'd rather just play 7 wonders or Alhambra separately as both do a better job specifically with what I like them for. Most cards are linear and I'm not sure on exact balancing of cards, though the most powerful are 1 ofs in any given player's tableau. I can be talked into this every now and then.

Among The Stars is a remix of a few popular games that came out a couple of years before it. It's almost admirable how little creativity can go into making a popular board game: take a mechanism here, mechanism there, put on some overly busy graphics and boom, you're done. 

You more experienced boardgamers shouldn't be in a hurry to test Among The Stars. You've seen all that is in the game before somewhere else and the borrowed elements aren't put together in a way that would improve them. Some alterations of the borrowed mechanisms actually make them worse: for example unlike 7 Wonders there is no deck progression, which makes the game duller as you don't get more powerful cards toward the end.

I love the game, but it has become a bit bloated.  The set up, now that there are so many locations, is really quite nightmarish.  Also, when playing with new players, the amount of text on the cards can make the drafting bog down significantly.

Among the Stars takes place in a war-ravaged galaxy where the warring alien races have declared peace in the wake of a threat with the potential to destroy them all. An Alliance is established to build space stations throughout the galaxy in order to promote trade among the races, strengthen diplomatic relations, and defend against this impending threat. Each player takes the role of one of those races trying to build the greatest space station. Through card drafting, the players select locations, and use these to build their station, scoring victory points based on the placement. The construction lasts four years, and alien race with the most points at the end wins.

Played 2p. Got boring and samy. The decisions did not excite me. Didn't get a feeling of planning. You just chose the card that gave you the most points there and then. Also it didn't feel different from round to round. And I prefer games which feels different first and last round.

after a video review: The drafting seems better because cards are played immediately. So there is no need to forward plan or remember which cards are in circulations. Also less chances to screw up yourself.

RATING: 7
...Repeat plays have started making me consider acquiring the game. I've been enjoying it more each time. Rating increased to 7. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Perfectly fine drafting game with a few other moving parts. Easy to teach and play. Due to text on cards it will take a couple plays to learn the card interactions, etc and with many expansions there is a fair bit of potential difference in each game play with the special cards. I think I prefer 7 Wonders for my tableau building game, but this one is easier to understand/teach. Can be a pain to keep moving one's space station if you build too close to another player or the end of the table, etc.

RATING: 8
7 Wonder in "space" with both meaning applying. Really like it, need to play it more to rate it. 

7.8.15 Setup is a bit of pain, but so far I really like it. I think it's about equal to 7 wonders in my eyes, and I'll use it mainly for lunchtime gaming at work to mix things up.

Among the Stars... Ein Draftspiel. Alle wählen gleichzeitig eine Handkarte, dann wird gleichzeitig gebaut. Die Kosten trägt jeder selbst. Entweder man bekommt sofort Punkte oder eben erst am Ende des Spiels. Die Karten beeinflussen sich gegenseitig. Manchmal darf man neben eine gebaute Karte keine mehr setzten, manchmal bringen viele Karten um die Gebaute viele Siegpunkte. Manche dürfen nicht nebeneinander sein, sonst gibts Punktabzug (Militär neben Freizeit o.Ä.)
Sehr schönes Spiel.

RATING: 7
It's refreshing to get a space game that isn't a three-hour empire builder, even if the theme is just kind of lightly dusted on. This game is clearly influenced by 7 Wonders, and you could do worse than be influenced by that, and it inherits some of the same difficult decisions that arise from the card-drafting mechanism (Do I pass this card to the guy who can use it really well, or do I keep it from him, sacrificing a better move for myself?) It also does its own thing with the idea, having you assemble a space station with various features on it. It's not a bad game (though the iconography isn't great: cards refer to types of cards with tiny little colored dots, and the difference between cards that score immediately and ones that do so at the end of the game is a pale yellow background that is not particularly noticeable.), but while it didn't really turn me off, it also didn't really compel me to play it more.

At 2 people it's an ok game. 
Not enough interaction we didn't play with Alien or objective though. 
Fairly simple game to learn. 

Played it at 6 it's a bit longer but it was all our first time. Played with alien race it was alot of fun. 

Highly recommend to always play with alien race and objective cards. It makes the game a lot more interactive. 
It's fun. 

Takes a lot of table space, so make sure you have enough space.

RATING: 5
Among the Stars felt like a mess. Much like Briefcase's take on deck building, AtS tries to combine drafting with tableau construction, and in my eyes fails.

The problem is that so many of the cards are situational. Often a card that would give 2-3 points would be 4 or more if you had gotten it sooner or later in the game. Indeed, you never feel like you're guiding your own destiny, but are just along for the ride.

I guess its fine for some, just to play along and see how things turn out, but even 7 Wonders (which I'm also not a gigantic fan of) makes you feel like your choices matter.

There's also no gauge for how well you're doing until the very end. Our first game had an early runaway leader. Everyone caught up and things seem balanced, then the end game saw a 20 point blowout which no one could quite understand. Underwhelming is the word I would use.

I'd also add that the game's art is really ugly.

Type: Card-based drafting tableau-building game for 2-4 players with only minimal direct interaction.

Best with: 
Weight: 
Duration: 30-60 minutes
Notes: 


Among the Stars is a base-building card game for 2-4 players. Players draft cards into their hands, and then play those cards in front of them to build out their starbase. Players score points for their creations based on game objectives of criteria printed on the cards. This results in a somewhat abstract game of base construction based upon rules, minimal direct interaction to screw other opponents over (though this is not strictly a multiplayer solitaire sort of game), and a decent amount of strategy based on the various ways to accrue points, either fast up front, or slow and played for the late game tallies.

Really like it. Takes up more space than Twilight Imperium though. Don't know why I haven't played this more. 

One criticism - none of the phases feel different. Unlike 7 Wonders, where there is progression, the 4 phases here are just to refresh hands. Maybe the expansions change this. 

However, the placement of cards and synergy between them is a lot better than 7 wonders.

This one obviously owes a lot to 7 Wonders, and a first play with three players did not reveal a lot of additional depth due to the added spatial aspect. What I liked a lot (apart from the great illustrations) is that the randomly added special cards also include some of the standard cards that feed back into each other. This makes the set collection aspect a bit more of a gamble and should boost the replayability of the game.
For now, I don’t see the need for having both Among the Stars and its spiritual predecessor in my collection, but further plays might convince me otherwise.

I love the idea of building space stations, but I was expecting the various locations to provide more interesting powers as opposed to scoring conditions. That said, I still enjoy it.

Also, I think I generally have a problem with drafting games because I like to know what other players are doing, but it seems drafting games drag on if you stop to evaluate other player actions. Also, I think people tend to ignore rules when no one is watching.

Creo que éste es el mejor juego de draft. Las habilidades de cada una de las cartas que escoges otorgan una personalidad única a tu estación espacial. Al principio no me gustaban mucho las cartas cuadradas, pero conforme vas creando tu nave, notas que son necesarias para que se acomoden bien las locaciones. Las habilidades de raza y las metas públicas personalizan más aún las estaciones. 

8 - Very good. Like to play, will probably suggest it, will never turn it down.

If you like 7 Wonders, there is a better than average chance you'll enjoy Among the Stars.  A drafting game in the same vein as 7 Wonders with the added kick of card placement.  You're drafting cards that act as new additions to a space station.  Where you place those cards matters, so be aware of what you're doing.

Highly Recommended.

7 Wonders meets Suburbia. I liked this far more than expected. Not sure if this fires 7 Wonders for me or not. I like how Suburbia implements a theme better. I also prefer the titles versus cards. This is underrated but just not liked enough to join my collection. All the more so since I know somebody who owns it.

Rating:

Game quality: Solid game but there's not really much of anything new here, which is an instant 7, and I don't think it really fires any game it is compared to. 7.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: I doubt it. Again, I like Suburbia better. I have other title placement games. I love the mechanic, but I'm not going all in on it. 4.

Do I want to play this if asked: I enjoyed it enough it where I would gladly play it again knowing any chance I had to be few and far inbetween. 9.

Overall: 7.49.

Rating Potential: About as high as it will go at 7.49. Any higher means I find the game quality even better, or I feel the need to buy it. I don't see either happening.

Among the Stars is the best card drafting game I've ever played.  In my opinion far superior to the ubiquitous 7 Wonders.  In this game you are designing a space station, which alone is an interesting thing to do.  But then you have the usual tension that's involved with drafting games.  For example, should you take the card you really need and pass a card to your neighbour that they need even more, or should you take the card that they need even though you don't need it at all?  It's agonizing stuff sometimes.  Also, you can tailor the amount of interaction (read screwage) between players.  If you like drafting games, I can't recommend this one enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, quick, relaxing draft game that a twist on card combos: it doesn't just matter what cards you have but where they are placed. Something about building your own colorful space station brings out the kid in me. 

The only reason this one isn't ranked higher is that I'm not sure about its replayability without expansions. Update: after more plays, still liking it quite a bit. Setup does take a long time for the game length.

It was okay. Not nearly as amazing as I'd been told. The card interplay was interesting, but the "score now" vs "score later" symbolism with just the white or yellow background wasn't great. Also, if you forget to score a couple placements it's hard to go back and figure out what you had then.

RATING: 7
Very similar in play to 7 Wonders but a bit less complex making it friendlier to new players, which I appreciate.  After a few plays, I enjoy it but it has a few flaws.  As a drafting game, I should be really interested in my neighbor's tableau but the small text makes it hard to keep track of what others are doing.  The visual card layout also makes it easy to miss certain info until several turns after the fact.  Fairly regular incidents of "Oh, I was supposed to pay a cube for this too", or "Oh, this has a 'max 1' and I've already built three of them" moments.  Killing parts of a station due to these kinds of mistakes is painful and punishing.  I also kind of miss the engine building in 7 Wonders -- there's no staging of the cards here so other than my station getting bigger I generally don't feel like I'm building on my previous cards.  Finally, because you get focused on passing and playing the cards, then looking at the next hand, points scored instantly seem to be easy to forget.  It would be nice if all points could be tallied at the end.  It does play quickly, which I appreciate, and the art is fantastic.  Certainly not a full replacement for 7 Wonders, but it is a solid, enjoyable game.

I like this game, but the setup time really kills it. There are times I want to play and then just walk away because I cannot face the prospect of putting another set of cards together. It doesn't help that all my stuff is pretty disorganized but I don't think it would be all that much easier even if it was organized. 

I really want to try this again because it's been so long since we last played

I will say that FoG is more intuitive with how the card types interact, while AtS is more open and straightforward. All rooms have some form of scoring mechanism, either instant or end-game. You also have the option to play with alien races, objectives and even confrontational cards if you like, so there is a lot of variation in the base game alone.

Great design, very happy I picked it up.

I've heard this called a 7 Wonders killer by a lot of people. I'm mixed. I like the addition of the spatial element and the Suburbia-style adjacency effects, but I think 7 Wonders is such a slick and sleek design of what it is. They are sufficiently different to make both worth playing. I'd like to try Ambassadors.

Really fun game.  The drafting works well (there end up being a good number of cards in any game that you want, and that you want to keep your opponent(s) from getting), then trying to plan the growth of your station as you go and watching it take shape is all sorts of fun on its own.  It's nice that the drafting part is in service to the build-a-space-station part, rather than being more abstract.

Is it just me or does this game seem remarkably like "Space Station" (http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108377/space-station)? Not just in basic theme but in several gameplay elements as well?

RATING: 9.2
Very very very good game. Some randomness to keep it replayable, some strategy to keep it enjoyable. Too bad there's so much text, so my non-English-speaking friends can't enjoy it with me. And the sci-fi theme just clicks for me.
The rules for two players are somewhat messy, but the game flows very nicely in three. It can take up fourth player easily, fifth is somewhat difficult and the sixth makes it overlong, the game really shines in 3-4.

Ambassadors checked out. Neat. They add some player decisions, especially when it's good to invite them. AND you get to build the ambassador's bureau, so inviting him is not a lost turn.

This is easily one of the top5 in my 150+ games collection. The only downside is very much tablespace, a long setup / teardown and the scoring between each turn considerably slows it down, but I guess there's no way to avoid that. :(

Borrows some mechanics from 7 Wonders, Fairy Tale, etc but with enough differences to make Among the Stars its own game. The player interaction seems a bit lower than 7 Wonders and the build rules are a little more complicated. Plays quick and needs a fair bit of table space. Need to play it some more to get a better appreciation for but I prefer 7 Wonders at the moment.

A drafting game in the same vein as 7 Wonders but set in a science-fiction setting. The difference here is that cards are placed on the table to form an evolving space station so visual spatial elements come into play and some sections require power that must be piped from power centers to the cards in question, which have distance rules. 

The other key element is the inclusion of objectives that can earn end of game bonuses. 

This is quite good and interesting for 5-10 plays before you need to think about expansions to mix it up.

7 wonders with a sci-fi theme, and the card placement matters as you often get bonuses from where the cards are located.

Feels like a cross between Suburbia and 7 Wonders, but doesn't really break any new ground beyond that. Regardless, I still enjoy this game for a lighter drafting game with a spatial aspect. Expansions have only made it better, and for a theme that's kind of ho-hum, in my opinion, it can certainly be a lot of fun. The only major strike I have against the game is that you have to score after almost every tile is placed. This can really slow down and break up the game as you adjust everyone's scores. Otherwise this game is fantastic.

It's a city-builder with a 7Wonders mechanic of playing 1 card from your hand, and then passing it on to the person next to you. 
Very well done on the graphic part.

You need to watch your "opponents" a lot more than in 7Wonders. Since you're doing that anyway, the game could have used more direct interaction.

In the end, not enough to keep me interested.

RATING: 4
Currently not impressed with this game! The art is fantastic, as are some of the components, but underneath there is a very shallow game. The game lacks structure, is basically pick the card with the most points. Different alien abilities were more of a gimmick being mostly annoying and slowed the game. I don't see any reason why others claim this is better than seven wonders. I would like it a lot more if they kept the good aspects of seven wonders; variety of resource management required to buy cards, buying of resources from neighbours, interacting with neighbours through military cards, and the simple progression of cards: cards get better in structured ages. Without these basics, there is minimal player interaction, even with "aggressive mode". Hate drafting is almost impossible, as there is most likely only a 1-2 point difference in anything you do and no matter what cards you pass, the next player could build 90% of them if not all of them, as the key resource is money. This game is great example of fantastic graphic marketing over game play. I have also become much more suspicious of these "paid previews" all Artipia games currently have of Tom Vasel and Undead Viking, opposed to unbiased non profit reviews.

This is among my favorite games. Definitely in the top 5. I believe I've written elsewhere about my love for games that allow you to create something you can look back on at the end. The fact you are building an awesome space station in this game is just an added level of cool. Drafting is a simple mechanic that serves the game well and allows it to scale quite easily. I feel each expansion has added a little more depth to the game in reasonable increments. I also enjoy how all the different mechanisms are modular. I can play with the ambassadors with my wife and only include the conflict sets with my friends who like to mess with one another. My only complaint with this game is that setup takes a really long time, even with my custom built insert separating the cards into manageable sets. Depending on what expansions I'm including, the game can take a good 20 minutes to put together. I also would recommend against adding ALL the modules in one game. I tried it..once.

An absolutely excellent game, with a lot of choices and a lot of ways to go to get the victory. The different alien powers add an extra level to the game, and they are pretty balanced in terms of gameplay. The use of power cubes as an additional cost for some of the cards is really neat, since you never have too many of them, and you do need to sacrifice the possibility of scoring victory points on a turn in order to get a new power generator.

Not a bad game, but each expansion makes what should be a quick game, a little slower and more convoluted.

Many people compare it to 7 Wonders because of their mechanic. I will also compare them because of the feelings they generate. After playing a game, I use to eb able to say what I did wrong and what I did well. This doesn't happen with 7 Wonders, and Among the Stars, or at least it happens to a much lesser degree. I'm always convinced I did whatever was best at that moment; it's just that sometimes it turns out to be good, and sometimes not.

Owns a lot to 7 wonders. Still I like theme here and it was rather nice experience and felt different enough. Biggest problem of this game is total lack of any kind of feeling of advancement. Every round the cards are from the same pool. Unlike in 7 wonders where there is a little bit of proggression of cards that enables small things like chaining them etc. is totally lacking from this one. This means some of "end game" cards can come in round 1 in AtS. You never have very little idea what kind of cards can come in general so all you can plan ahead is pretty much the card you pick this round and no more.

Despite the potentially tedious setup, I genuinely adore this game. It's probably my favorite pure drafting game. And I think it's a clever explanation to have a game about "building" a space station, have a "spatial" element to it (pun definitely intended) as you lay down cards.

Other bonuses that keep the game feeling fresh: the different race powers, the objectives, the seemingly myriad other little modules that can be included and combined without making the basic game play feel bloated. Only downside -- it can be a table hog, especially at 6 players. Maybe cap it at 4.

[b]Among the Stars[/b] was sold via auction 7/10/15.
Received in a trade 12/18/14.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]I thought AtS would fight for playtime with 7W since my family loves drafting games and at first it did. Then it all came crashing down. I have two major gripes with this game. First there isn't any progression between rounds, you'll see the same rooms in round 1,2,3 and 4. The ambassadors don't do enough to change that either, it's too bad there isn't any kind of progression in the rooms you're building. 

My second gripe is the scoring. There were always times during each game where someone lost track of scoring some of their rooms which makes the final scores a bit questionable and the whole experience unsatisfying. This became a major pitfall with AtS, the scoring is fiddly as all get out. this lead to my trading the game away and us continuing to break out 7 Wonders when we want to play a drafting game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great family game with easy to teach rules.
- Love the art on the cards, and while unrealistic I wish the cards were bigger to show off the art.
- Card drafting, this is a mechanic I love and I think AtS pulls it off quite well.
- Love the spacial aspect of building your space station, actual card placement is critical to being successful in this game.
- Having to balance your power supply adds another dimension to consider when building your space station.[/i]

A more complicated version of Fairy Tale - same draft mechanic, play the same 4 rounds. But play out all 6 cards over a round and then have lots more different ways for how the cards score. This is a bit gentler because there's little direct interaction. It's also double or more the length. It introduces a lot of positioning dependencies for scoring, so you can play a card (mostly) anywhere to your tableau, but oftentimes how much it scores depends on other cards around it, not just what else is in your tableau which is where Fairy Tale parks. Still, Fairy Tale is fabulous pedigree so this gets a decent rating as well. It's pleasant to play and fast enough, maybe a bit too solitaire-y for many.

RATING: 8
This has been a hit with everyone I've played with. A simple drafting mechanic and the limit of three actions makes this very accessible and easy to teach. Players seem to enjoy watching their space stations grow over the course of the game and it often presents you with hard choices of which cards to choose and which to pass on.

The setup time can be a little much due to the way you have to construct the draw deck, but a little organisation goes a long way to helping with that. My one misgiving in the games I've played so far, is that you score a very similar amount each turn and final scores are often very close, which makes me think that luck-of-the-draw might have an effect on the outcome of many games. It also makes me wonder if you are presented with tough choices or just the feeling that they are, since they do not effect things in a big way by the end of the game.

I look forward to trying the Ambassadors expansion to see if that changes things up a little. If not, I can see my initial 8 dropping to a 7/6 over time.

Not a bad game at all, and I personally like the theme better than 7 Wonders. Other than that though it shares all the negatives and positives of 7 Wonders nearly exactly, except it plays fewer people, so I don't see it replacing 7 Wonders for most groups.

This card game is more of a tile-laying game--each player was trying to build a city out of cards drawn randomly from a common deck. Unfortunately, there was almost no interaction in this game, and how you did depends mostly on what card you draw. Most cards didn't have particularly restricting placement rules or bonuses. Disappointing.

Comment: Best described as 7 Wonders in space with a spatial aspect. Works well with 2 players, although the dummy player can get a bit confusing with all the cards passing around. Very enjoyable game.

A drafting game, where you build up a space station, what can go wrong with such a wonderful concept? It is such a nice idea, but so badly implemented that any joy I had going into the game turned into boredom. For a drafting game, the strategic choices are minimal as it really makes very little difference what you choose. The designer has tried to subvert this by making a bonus for the player who has the most of a type of building. Where in some games this works, you have more incentives to build different parts of your space station due to the other buildings, leaving you with a feeling of sacrificing rather then optimising. I may be missing the point of the game, but I just felt so flat after the game, I felt I was on the world's must incredible diet. Add to the mixer boring Alien's, boring back story, boring and unimaginative buildings, you are yes very board. Did I mention that the shape of your space station doesn't matter... why not?

Didn't make the cut as the game was abducted by Aliens. I would play this again, but I would prepare for disappointment.

RATING: 8
Wow, for such simple mechanics, there is a lot going on...

- first is figuring out what to play to help yourself
- next is figuring out what NOT to pass to someone else so as to not help them
- 3rd is keeping enough money and energy available so you can build what you want

I can't wait to play it with the Objectives and Alien Race cards... That should add even more depth.

So my rating is on my impression of playing just the basic game so far.

The only drawback is it doesn't appear as 2 player friendly as I had originally hoped, but given I usually have 3 or 4 players, it's not a huge deal. (Sometimes 5 or 6 - hear that Artipia - you could sell me some extra player expansions.)

I liked this. It's a drafting game a la 7 wonders, but the interaction wasn't limited to your neighbours, which I really appreciate. You're building a space station, and the nicest one wins (you get points for the cards you add to your station). Nice game, I wouldn't mind playing again, but not something I want to add to our collection.

RATING: 6
This is a card-drafting space-themed game. After one play, I rate it a 6. I like the theme, and the art is nice. However, this game falls into a gap between Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders, and this gap is too small. Let me explain. I love Fairy Tale. It is so simple and plays very quickly. Draft cards (including the ability to draft defensively) and play them, then add up your score. 7 Wonders adds a bit of a story arc to this framework by separating cards into progressively stronger and more expensive Ages. In the end, Among the stars has the repetition of Fairy Tale but not the progressive feelings of 7 Wonders. It ends up feeling a little bloated and suffers for it. On the other hand, it does add one interesting element. When players build cards in their space stations, the spatial position of the cards is important. Still, not enough to save the game from mediocrity. I'd play again, but won't request it.

Box, why are you so big?

After first play: some interesting ideas.  I like the spatial element. It feels much more tactical than 7 wonders. I'll try 2-player again with the official 2-player variant. After that I might try to amp up the strategy with a  greed-like hand building variant. It works great in that game and adds strategy and some tension.

RATING: 7.5
Another great tile laying game in a similar vein as Suburbia, but with an additional layer of story-telling. Players each play a different race of aliens competing to build the most valuable space station. The catch is that they are each relying on shared resources through a card-draft mechanism similar to 7 Wonders. 

We typically play this as a two player game using the alternative rules (without dummy players) mentioned in the rule book and as originally posted here to BGG. The game plays quickly with little down-time. At the end, it's very satisfying to see the space station you've constructed, even if it's not technically "the most valuable"! 

The only criticism of the game is that the special abilities of the various races each player chooses from can be rather uneven. So far, anyone who has played as the Vax has won. Well, except for me that is. Apparently I'm terrible at this game. But it doesn't seem to matter, because it's so much fun, I don't mind losing at all!

I could write a lenghty analysis and comparison of '7 Wonders' and 'Among the Stars', but since neither is quite my cup of tea, I don't feel like doing so. I will however say that thematically this game is more appealing to me than '7 Wonders' and it achieves capturing the feeling of building something meanwhile '7 Wonders' is, at least for me, just slapping and buying cards. These are the reasons why I've kept 'Among the Stars' in my shelf while '7 Wonders' ended up in the hands of my ex-girlfriend without me feeling like having lost anything... when it comes to board games, that is.

Apart from the theme, it plays like 7 Wonders. This is a very good game! It's fast, easy and it has a great tension. And I always think of Bab-5 when I build my space station! As with 7W, the pre-game card selection is a little tedious, but not that bad as in its sister game. What bothers is me is the rectangular size of the cards - I have a shuffle problem with sleeved cards.

Pick-&-pass card drafting and strategic placement of cards to build space station (the core of the game relies on the card/tile placement).

Several similarities to 7 Wonders: p&p draft mechanic, types of buildings, guild-type cards, 2-player dummy player, variable faction abilities, needed table space.
While Sci-fi themed, AtS has less interaction: resource purchasing, military conflict but it does have an 'aggressive' rule variant. (conflict cards). Several expansions have introduced additional interaction/conflict. 

Ultimately it probably won't replace 7 Wonders in our collection; although it may be a lighter, better gateway.

[b]Comment:[/b]While this game does share the card drafting mechanic of 7 wonders, it feels more like Suburbia than anything else. While beautiful, the cards look very busy and it can be hard to read the other player's board states when effects require you to. There is substantial replayability as you only see a fraction of the available cards each game, however the expansion modules that add anything other than special locations add a lot to the setup time and dilute the the game.

Brilliant fun.  The art is incredible, the theme is fantastic, and the game play is tight.  I described it to my friends as "7 Wonders meets Alhambra" and feel the description is mostly apt.  
A complaint, however: Don't make me buy an expansion to play a game five-player.  That's disappointing.  That said, trying to introduce this game to as many of my friends as a can...I just have to do it three at a time, which is a drag.  
But, yeah, you got me Stronghold.  I'm buying the expansions.

Imagine if Seven Wonders was longer and was hybridized with Suburbia. I really thought it was a neatly put together game. However, and this is not a critique so much of the game but rather it's design, the cards used are far to large for more than three players at a single standard sized table. The amount of table space you need for this game can be problematic.

A combination of card drafting along with building a tableau. There is some restrictions on card placement, but the value of the cards look more situational than planned. I got the feel of being more tactical than strategic. Especially that I couldn't see a deck progression all seem to be the same. I rarely had angst about the cards I was passing versus what I should select.
Ultimately the game didn't do much for me.

I like games in which you build your own board, and this is a game of this sort (kinda). The spatial element of the game gives you a nice visual feedback and presents you with interesting decisions throughout the game. Simple rules, easy to learn. It needs more cards and more interaction, though, because it's too easy to make it into multiplayer solitaire. Expansions should help with it. 

Not sure why, but it reminds me of Seasons. Maybe it's the draft part.

I'm not exactly sold on various alien races. Some of their abilities influence the game heavily and don't feel balanced.

The card artwork is absolutely superb.

7 Wonders IIIIIINNN SPAAAAAAAAAAACE....

Sort of. There are two very major differences between the games. First, the orientation of all of your cards matters. Second, you score a majority of the buildings immediately upon constructing them, rather than only at the end of the game (there are still some that do stuff at the end, but they can still have a basic value you score immediately). Sadly, the second point slows down the game a bit, but it does open up some new design space.

I also appreciate that there are no resource buildings in the main deck like in 7 Wonders. The only non-money resource is available for construction at any time, so nobody is totally hosed out of a resource. Instead it generally just takes a "dead" turn to build the reactor needed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial plays are strong.  This is a fun and strategic game without being overwhelming to new players.  I also think it will have more longevity than 7 Wonders.  I backed this project on Kickstarter, and my biggest complaint seems to be the overwhelming number of expansions.  Strange criticism, I know, but it really is a glut of new stuff all at once, and I don't really know what to add, and what not to.  It all feels like a hodgepodge of cool ideas with no culling of weaker ideas.  Still, you don't have to play with anything you don't want to, and the added variety should keep things fresh for some time.  Definitely worth checking out if you initially loved 7 Wonders but have grown a bit tired of it.

edit: due to Schwerkraft's incapacity to publish the expansions as promised I abandon the game, although I loved it. It simply looses replayablity without any expansion.

Among the Stars plays a lot like 7 Wonders. The main differences being the theme and amount of setup time. For me, AtS felt much simpler and perhaps a little less balanced in comparison. My reasoning for this? Well, Among the Stars has one big deck that is used for all 4 rounds, without much change based on the number of players- because of this, each round plays basically the same, with just small changes in tactics to accommodate card draws.

I don't mind the simplicity of Among the Stars. It is still a very enjoyable game. An expansion or two would go a long way to give this game it's own unique identity, however.

UPDATE: i have since added many expansions. They are great for variety, but now AtS doesn't see much play because setup time is ridiculous. Seems like it's hard to find the right balance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Things I like about Among the Stars:

1) I enjoy the theme and the artwork of this game.  It's very attractive on the table with its nice art and vivid colors. While a game doesn't have to be nice looking to be a good game, it certainly is a plus.

2) the drafting mechanic.  I am a big fan of 7 wonders and used to enjoy a good Magic draft back in the day.  No surprise I enjoy that aspect of Among the Stars as well.

3) the spatial mechanic.  This really defines Among the stars for me, as I really enjoy "constructing" my outpost as efficiently as possible.  Many times the cards are designed to score efficiently when placed in a logical fashion.  For example, ambassador's quarters near an embassy or crew quarters placed closely together.  I also like the power system (which is part of the spatial mechanic).

The downsides of Among the Stars?  Not many that I have found so far.

1) it does take a lot of table space

2) I don't enjoy the "aggressive" game.  I am not a fan of targeted attacks in games such as this, as I find it too often makes someone play kingmaker.  I much prefer general attacks that hit all opponents as in Dominion. It's easy to avoid this, however, as the aggressive mode is an add on.

My initial impression is an 8, and will be interested to see if this changes over more plays.

Review from 10th Dec 2012:

Among the Stars was my first drafting game. Enjoyable, but spatial aspect didn't add a lot of depth. Scoring board is ugly. However, lots of different cards and card types to add, as well as the advanced game. Latter didn't add a great deal and a couple of OP [over-powered] choices. 

Solid 6 (dependent on whether you've played 7 wonders).

After 1 play : Feels very similar to 7 wonders in mechanics but in space.  Not sure yet if that makes it better or worse or just different.  Our first game felt a little bit more friendly than 7 wonders as there is no military scoring at the end of each round.
Having said that, in order to win, you need to key an eye on all players space stations which is difficult to do and with an expansion in the pipeline for 5-6 players, I can see this becoming a problem.  Scoring the same as 7 wonders for now.

I got this game for Christmas in 2012 - and since then it's only seen 3 or 4 plays. Not that it's a bad game at all - but it's more of a filler and there are plenty of other games that I would usually rather play. Nevertheless, I do think it's a good game - a light drafting game along the lines of 7 wonders, with optional objective cards and special abilities unique to each player (the first couple of plays were without these, but I now think they're essential, especially the objectives - I still haven't played with the conflict cards, and likely never will). The spatial aspect differentiates the game from 7 wonders, and many of the cards introduce interesting interactive elements. However, it flows less well than 7W, what with having to stop to score after every single round, and it's also limited to 3 or 4 players (there is a 2-player variant in the rulebook, but I can't imagine ever wanting to play it if I'm looking for a 2-player game). Still a good game though, hence the 7 rating.

7 Wonders Light.  By removing the resources for construction, the game turns become quicker as one really only needs consider one's own tableau.  But with that comes an even greater feeling of multi-player solitaire.  Even striving for objectives felt like solo mission.  I actually expect this to grow a bit as players become familiar with the cards and what they will need as the only thought might be not passing certain cards to the next player.  

On the plus side, easier to explain and likely to launch faster than 7 Wonders, so a nice introductory game for someone unfamiliar with the card drafting genre.  (I see no reason why Objectives and Alien Races shouldn't be used from the start, but at least it is an option to drop them if necessary.)

I will go ahead and compare this to 7 wonder as everyone else does. I find this game much easier to teach then 7 wonders because it only has 2 resources in the game at this time. I like how the whole deck of cards is shuffled and you are never sure if the cards you are wanting are going to show up in what round. I would rather play this over 7 wonders just because of that reason alone. 7 wonders is a good game but is you play it a few times you already know what comes in each age.

Very similar to 7 Wonders but with a space theme. The game allows you to build your own space station based on cards you choose through drafting. Very different paths to victory, either immediate points, or endgame points, or combination of both. Common objectives to score points and leaders to provide a special ability give this game great replay-ability. Good strategy and planning game and I am happy to play whenever possible.

11-03-2014. Rated after one play. Simple card-drafting game with neat spatial tile-placing element. In this game you draft cards that give you VPs depending on previously drafted and placed cards. Depending on where you placed cards before, drafting decisions can be drastically changed. Since for one player the same card can be worth 10vps, while for you its just 2. 

I don't think the game plays well with 2, but with 3 the game is really fun.

Only 1 play in.  I think I still prefer 7 Wonders as my draft game of choice, but this was fun too.  

Some things I didn't like by comparison:
1. It takes up more room per player.  A minor complaint, but one that happens with all "tile laying" games.
2. Every round feels like you are just rinsing and repeating.  There's no real progression.
3. The "leader" I had felt pretty useless compared to others, particularly when some take-that actions screwed my plans (I didn't expect that in this type of game).
4. Some cards truly felt useless.  At least in 7W, building something that doesn't go with my engine produces some type of benefit even if you can't maximize it.  While I'm usually for aggression in games, this type is not one where it excels.

RATING: 3
Apart from the artwork overpowering the functionality of the cards, the other turn off for me is that it's deadly dull. It's a rather solitaire experience. Clever play is going to require experience and knowledge of card bonuses, about half of which you must build before you may or may not be handed the required card. Most of the time you're just calculating which card will hand you the most points in that hand. There are a lot of better games out there.

Totally lifeless drafting game. This game aims to add a spatial element to the Fairy Tale drafting method but the spatial aspect of the game is very simple and offers no tension. Every card just gives you points and it's boring.

similar to 7 wonders but with a lovely spatial element to the stations.

It doesn't "add" much but it doesn't actually detract, and feels like you are able to actually build your starbase, as opposed to the abstraction that is "my civilization has these random components."

RATING: 8
The game is definitely easy to grasp and as the only difference in the 3/4 player games is a few duplicates of various location cards, I think it would play pretty much the same with either number.  

We did use the race abilities - an easy enough add in, nothing complicated to pick up but a nice addition.  We drew randomly for the races.  The fact that not all of the races, Objectives or Special Locations are used in every game helps to ensure replayability I think.  I had explained the rules for the Conflict cards and had them out.  For our first game, we passed on using them, but will definitely add them in for future plays, at least to give them a try.  I think as the game is played more they would be good to add.  Once you get familiar with the cards and how things play off of one another they could work either for you to catch up in points or to slow down the person in the lead. 

The objectives chosen are for everyone.  Not only to decide which one(s) you want to try for, but you can clearly see who else might achieve them.  (One of the races is allowed to select a secret objective from the remaining cards.)

The one thing negative is the VP track.  With the spaces zig-zagging  back and forth it can be difficult at best to quickly determine scores.

I've read that this is similar to 7 Wonders and there are some definite nods to it.  I'm a big fan of drafting in any game and this is no exception.  I love how the cards interact and there always feels like there are points to be had.  Unlike in 7 Wonders, where when you bury a card for money you feel like you've wasted a turn - in AtS, it's setting up your next purchase.  Additionally, I think that the conflict cards add some nice interaction and can be a way of pulling back any runaway leader, while still giving the leader a chance to bury those kinds of cards.  Excellent game that is quick to pick up and easy to learn.  I'll probably upgrade this rating once I know the cards even better.

Played once with 3P, and another time with 4P. While Among the Stars appears substantially different from 7 Wonders at first blush, it feels very much like the same game. The primary difference is that it gets rid of the resource purchasing system and adds a spatial element similar to that of [thing=123260][/thing]'s. A negative change it makes is that there is no progression in the types of cards that can be found as the game goes on.

Space themes don't really interest me, and I find the art a bit too busy to enable a quick scan of the board.

Love this game! It's sort of like 7 Wonders in space with tile placement (except the tiles are square cards). You draft cards that represent types of space stations that you place down into your system. Different card types interact in different ways, so there are multiple routes you can take to victory. Really, the game is quite similar to 7 Wonders. I don't know how you could enjoy one and dislike the other. It's different ENOUGH for me in that I want to own this as well, but some might disagree with that.

The other players were comparing this to 7 Wonders. On one hand I agree that the lack of so many symbols is a plus, I have an issue with the exceptions. In 7 wonders there is basically one exception you need to watch for - no buildings with the same name. In Among the Stars, you need to look out for several different restrictions. And frankly, the graphic design is not great.

I wouldn't turn down more games, but I feel that 7 Wonders required less hand holding past the first round than Among the Stars.

I have only played the base game so far.  I need to try it with the expansions.  As it is I am sure I will get more plays in on this just because my sister loves it so much.

The game is usually compared against 7 Wonders which makes sense. The games is both easier to play/teach than 7 Wonders and I believe to many it will feel less random.  The randomness of what is going to show up in the game feels less game changing than the guilds in 7 Wonders.  There is also more options for scoring and you get a better feel actually building something.

Overall I think it is a great game.  I hope the expansions add more to the game though.  For me the base game feels like there isn't enough happening.

Meshes card drafting and tile laying nicely, creating a neat spatial challenge. Kind of a mash up of suburbia and fairytale but in space. Space theme is evocative and enhances the experience.

Among the Stars is, in my opinion, a massively under-appreciated game. While many consider 7 Wonders to be the quintessential drafting game, I prefer Among the Stars. The game mechanisms are similar to any other drafting game: draw cards, take one, and pass the rest to your neighbor. However, where you place your card is sometimes just as important as the card you take, as you will be building your own space station on the table in front of you. It's quite engaging, and that's without mentioning that each player will also have their own alien race with unique special powers. In my eyes, Among the Stars is the best drafting game available. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
"7 Wonders" in space. I love "7 Wonders" and I love space-themed games, but unfortunately this fell a little bit short. Overall this is a fine game, but I have two main concerns with it, which is why I have decided to let it go.

The first is the constant need to read texts. Over time I have come to dislike games with extensive little texts on cards more and more. Contrast this with some of my favourite games like "7 Wonders" and "Race for the Galaxy", which manage to convey everything with iconography. If they could do "Among the Stars" with iconography, I would probably rate it much higher.

The second is the importance of the physical layout of the cards on the table. At first sight this seems like a neat idea and a novel mechanic, but during gameplay it became a nuisance on more than one occasion. I always felt like I had built something in the wrong location, thus blocking me from playing another card, I would otherwise have liked to play. This problem would be mitigated over time, as you become more familiar with the deck and can already construct anticipating maybe getting some cards on the future, but here's the rub - I don't like games, which require knowledge of the deck. Contrast this, once again, with the above mentioned card games, where you can perfectly well and quite successfully build your tableau with the cards you get and without necessarily having to be familiar with the whole deck in general.

Aside from these two quibbles, this is a perfectly fine game, but as the mechanic are done better in "7 Wonders" and the theme in "Race for the Galaxy", I see no need to keep this game.

One of a number of games that are utilizing the drafting mechanic make super popular by Seven Wonders.  Even though the card placement mechanic is interesting, the over all game is just average due to lackluster art, card variety, and depth.

Absolutely awesome drafting game where players are competing to build the greatest space station. Players draft components which they can attach to their station. Each has either an 'instant' or 'delayed' ability which will provide VP's/Interaction in some way.

The Ambassadors expansion adds a new kind of card which can go into your station in the form of 'ambassadors'. These cards are available for anyone to obtain, and provide benefits that represent the race they're from. This is a really great addition and injects the game with more player interaction.

Ultimately I love this game, and find it considerably more awesome than it's somewhat similar-counterpart 7 Wonders. This could easily end up my most played game in 2014.

7 Wonders-style drafting game in space. It might be a bit better than 7 Wonders, but only a bit, and it doesn't accommodate the same number of players. At least choices feel more meaningful because they aren't as obvious, but it's still a multiple-paths-to-victory point salad. Annoyingly, this game has the worst scoring track I've ever seen, and I'm docking it a point just for that. It's that bad.

1 play, Origins 2015 demo 

They were just playing a very basic version, which was OK to learn the rules but not really very exciting. It highlights drafting, which I already know about and might be the least interesting thing about [thing=68448]7 Wonders[/thing]! This was just drafting with a space theme, and using the cards to build a tableau in the form of a spaceship instead of just having groups of colored cards. I think I might enjoy the game more than 7 Wonders, but their demo really wasn't very helpful to me. I guess I'll need to play this game for real some time ....

RATING: 8
This game is incredibly similar to 7 Wonders (even the first expansion, Ambassadors, is similar to the Leaders expansion for 7 Wonders).  Each turn players will draft a card from a hand of cards and add it to their space station, discard it for another power reactor, or discard it for 3 money (just like 7 Wonders).

From there, to be fair, the game differs a bit.  There are only 2 resources in this game, money and power cubes, and most of the cards in this game just grant points with a few granting money and even fewer still having some other kind of effect.  There is also a big spatial element to this game, each card built adds onto your space station and many cards grant bonus points depending on where they are placed and the overall makeup of your space station.

I am keeping and think there is a place in my collection for both 7 Wonders and this game.  Mainly because 7 Wonders accommodates 7 well (I still think it is one of the few games that can play this many without adding much extra play time) and also has a lot quicker setup and smaller space constraints.

Once you have expansions for this game the way you have to decide which cards to play and put them back in an organized fashion after each play makes setup and tear down take quite a while.  If I didn't enjoy it as much as I do this would have me strongly consider not dealing with it.  Plus because you are constantly expanding your space station across 4 drafting rounds this game also takes up a lot of table space although that's a middling complaint if you have a big enough table...I myself doubt I could accommodate more than 4 players on a reasonably large table.

The streamlined, space version of "7 Wonders", which I like as well, yet I prefer "Among the Stars". To stick with comparisons, this does play even more solitaire, I yet have to play it in the aggressive mode, cannot wait to try that. So, it is card based, you build your own space station, and I quite enjoy it.
The artwork is very gorgeous, the whole design is great and for me that makes a good game experience even better. Once you know the rules, it can be a very quick game, we like to take the time to see everybody's move and choices  and don't play the cards simultaneously but go around each turn.
One of my new favorites!

Played the two player variant tonight which works but is a bit fiddly when using the two virtual players. It works and I am glad it is an option for me and the hubby now but I prefer the 3 or 4 player version.

RATING: 6
Only got one play of this in. It's really hard to convince people to play this. At first, the whole combining a rectangular grid with drafting sounded really fun, but in effect all it does is make it really difficult to keep track of what other players are doing, especially since you can barely keep track of your own things, at least in a timely manner. There's also the fact that this game just takes up a huge amount of table space. It's a huge pain in the ass to keep moving cards around to keep them together tighter to make room for other cards just to find that you just don't have enough table for the game. It's also difficult to play optimally when you're forced to be mindful of accidentally intruding on another player's space with your cards.

Among the Stars is an great tile laying and resource management game with an excellent theme and very nice artwork.  The passing mechanic, reminiscent of 7 Wonders is always a welcome thing with these types of games and AtS certainly makes the most of it.

I actually think the base game is pretty good. But I bought it together with "The Ambassadors" and a bunch of promos because I wanted it to be a good quick-playing 6-player game. (You needed the extra cards from the expansion to have enough to play with more players.) Unfortunately, playing with fewer players is better.

Expansion cards take a simple game and muck up the set-up. You can't have a good draft game if the cards are random, and setting up balanced sets of cards is too much work to bother with. Table-space per player is quite large, so playing with more than 4 players makes it very difficult to even tell what everyone else is playing. That kills a lot of the interactivity of the Draft.

Ironically, I think I'd probably have this on my shelf if I'd just picked up the base game, but at this point, there are too many other things I'd rather play. That said, if someone brought it to game night and wanted to play, I'd be glad to join them. It's just too much setup and tear down for me to inflict it on anyone else myself. 

I hope to find someone who'll appreciate this more than I do.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I feel like this game really shows off what is good about 7 Wonders.  I want to like this game more because I like the space theme, but it doesn't have interesting decisions or player interaction.  At least in 7 Wonders you really want to pay attention to the players on your left and right and do some synergistic things with them/hate draft some important things/beat them in military.  Your choices can be really interesting once you get going.  It's not my favorite, but I think it works reasonably well.

In Among the Stars there are some garbage targeted effects and the goals, and that's about it.  Pick the best thing, build it.  If you want to build a power plant or take money, discard the best thing for the guy you are passing to.  There is no progression like in 7 Wonders, and no really interesting powers like in any tableau game.  Pretty unimpressed.

A light game that barely offers sufficient layers in a non-brain drain format. Cool artwork, though.

The square cards were the right design choice since they're being used like tiles to build your space station, thus reducing table space needed.

I like the expansions, which add variation to the game. But here's the big knock against ATS: gameplay is not dynamic, and it can be somewhat boring at times. 

Paid $100 for latest KS bundle, and our group just doesn't play the game at all. One of the most overrated games in my collection.

Fun drafting / 7 Wonders type game. The spacial aspect of the game (and the space theme) definitely is a big plus. However, the cards feel too simple as they are balanced around giving VP and not building an engine. The different game rounds (years) don't feel very different, and there isn't as much of a story arc or progression that I enjoy. Still fun and could see some future cards really making it a lot better.

Also, it loses a few points due to the IndieGoGo exclusive promos. Nothing gameplay related should be permanently exclusive as it just limits the enjoyability for everyone and drives up prices on the secondary market for true fans. Give early backers some cool looking stuff, not things that change the game!

Decent tile placement game where you build your own star base. Simple tiles and a straightforward drafting mechanic mean that you can teach it and get through a game very quickly.

Without the expansions this is the absolute definition of a solitaire game--there's no interaction at all.

Reasonably fun, but lacks a WOW! factor that'd make me want to pull this out more often.

I'd heard criticisms about this being a fairly blatant rip-off of 7 Wonders. And it is. Unfortunately, they've added nothing that improves the game and instead only worsened it.

The scoreboard is terrible and unclear. Once a few cards are laid out, it's impossible to tell which colour each player is, there is a huge amount of text that you now need to be aware of and the colours are a garish mess.

Add in to the fact that of the 4 alien races dealt out at the start, one was capable of scoring a maximum of 5 points (choose and score an additional hidden scoring card) versus one which gifted a player 10 points and helped him win 2 end game bonuses (your reactor is every colour).

My favourite game of all time at this point of time, even though I tend to lose in it. :) We played with the Ambassadors expansions from the very beginning which is a must buy and gives so much colour to the game. Among the Stars has an excellent card drafting mechanic (similar to 7 Wonders) with tile laying (similar to Suburbia), but everything is spiced up with a fun space theme. The variable setup (randomly chosen basic and special tiles) guarantee that you will never play the same game twice. The artwork is gorgeous and the different racial powers, ambassadors to hire, and yearly events give an excellent flavour to the game. It also never outstays it welcome, one game can be wrapped in an hour regardless of the player count (having played with 2-4 players).

RATING: 5
Chosing and playing the tiles is very similar to 7 wonders (you can`t build a stage of a wonder, but you can trade a tile for energy, the second currency after coins).

It` important where you build the tiles - they give bonus points when some circumstances occur. The problem is points and bonus poits are the only thing that the buildings make. It`s something like 7 wonders only with blue and violet cards (but without the other colours violet cards would be not very interesting). 

This game need some twist. Only points is too boring.

Otherwise, the components of this game are of excellent quality, and the gameplay and artwork are intuitive and beautiful, respectively.

I enjoy the card placement and the sense that you are actually building a space station.  I do not like that the text is so tiny and you can barely read the cards in your own hand, not to mention cards your opponents have played.  I've found that it really helps to have each player announce what they are building and what it does, otherwise, this feels very much like a solitaire game.

I hear the expansions fix that though...

This is very similar to 7 wonders, but with tableau building and a space station theme.  I'm not sure which one I like better.  Among the Stars is easier to teach and has more combo building.  But one thing I miss from 7 wonders is the progression of cards between ages.

AtS also felt more multiplayer solitaire because for the most part it doesn't matter what your opponents are building.  In 7 wonders you are at least constantly looking at your immediate neighbors.  Either way, they are both good and I enjoy playing both.

RATING: 4
Not terrible. I'm a huge 7 Wonders fan and this is a slightly simpler, not quite as elegant,  not quite as deep, space-themed 7 Wonders.

We used the spaceships module in my game and that seems like a big mistake in the game design. It works fine mechanically but it greatly slows down the game. The spaceships require you to look around at all of your opponents' cards and then decide where to place the spaceships. This can take some time if you're trying to play optimally, but I would usually just make a sub-optimal placement in order to keep the game moving. Often the opponent will also have to put some spaceships back into your tableau, just taking even longer.

There is also a pretty simple cost-to-points conversion that you can do to determine the best card every time. This card costs 2 and gives me 3 points, this card costs 3 and gives me 5 points. This is the main reason I don't rate the game higher. Every card basically just gives you points so each hand of cards isn't very exciting. 7 Wonders is much more varied with the different powers, resources, escalating cost-reward from age to age, and different ways to get points. In 7 Wonders you have to make real choices about what you need now, what you'll need later, and what your opponents need. Among the Stars is much more tactical as you try to eek out one or two more points per card where the cards are mostly the same.

It's still fun enough to play from time to time, but I would always choose 7 Wonders.

Update: Fields of Green has improved upon the Among the Stars system greatly. While it's still no 7 Wonders, it has replaced Among the Stars.

I like the card drafting in it and the building of a space station in front of you. Sadly my wife doesn't like it, so it won't hit the table as often as I would like, but I think the different alien races and the mechanisms in it really can keep it fresh over multiple plays. Setup is fast, too, but table space is a bit bigger due to the space station you build. My box has the Hythian and Wiss promos (english, game is german).

Good game, if you like 7 wonders I prefer this (but usually prefer space theme regardless). Art is awesome. Could get old though as you generally do what's best for you every turn and thems the brakes if it doesn't turn out you are the winner. There are some decisions to be made as you learn all the cards better like timing when to build another power generator.

:star: space stations are cooler than ancient cities

:star: awesome cubes for power

:nostar: no scaling from age to age

First Impression:

A pretty impressive drafting game that focuses on tactical choices and less on strategic ones.

Things I liked: It's fun and easy to play, has an excellent theme that carries through, great variety including extremelly variable set-up (races, objectives, s-cards) which means that no two games will be the same, beautifull artwork and finally it seems well-balanced, which is a feat. In addition, the spacial aspect allows for some very interesting rooms and for a very impressive end game table appearence.

Things I didn't like: Other than the objectives which create some "racing" interaction, there really is little interaction between the players (I didn't play aggressive mode however - not sure if I'd like to either). The cards are nice in their variety but ultimatelly not that important to care if you pass them to an opponent. They mostly generate vps, and with very few exceptions, they don't allow for specialisations - meaning what's better for you is almost always better for everybody else as well - and that creates easy choices. This lack of strategy appears to be a design choice, as the lack of scaling cards, complex card combos and synergies is apparent. Other than that, my complaints are minor. The scoring board is bad (duh!), and the graphic design of the cards is lacking (the illustrations are magnificent though) as it fails to give an easy impression of what each card is.

Overall this seems like a good, solid, light, well-balanced drafting game, with some interesting if generally easy tactical choices and a great theme. I'd love to play more!

This game brings exactly what I wanted 7 Wonders to bring to me. Fun. My copy of 7 Wonders and the Leaders expansion...listed for trade.

This one however has a spacial element that I enjoy so much more than what is present in 7 Wonders.

The only thing you do to modify this card drafting game for 2 players is deal out 2 neutral hands. So you don't pass directly to the other player you pass to the neutral pile and then take their neutral pile. It works fabulously. Would actually work in 7 Wonders to some extent I think.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110277/among-the-stars]Among the Stars[/url] has as its main mechanic the card draft in the likes of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders]7 Wonders[/url]. However the game differs not only in theme (sci-fi), but also in the use of the cards: you have to put them in your "Station", paying, usually, credits and, eventually, energy. This energy must come from one of the power stations (you begin with one), but they have limits, only being able to feed locations up to two spaces away, and its energy supply is also limited (2 cubes each). This makes necessary to, sometimes, discard one card in order to build a power station at the cost of the card and 1 credit.

The use of energy touches the main point of difference between [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders]7 Wonders[/url] and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110277/among-the-stars]Among the Stars[/url]: [b]the position of the locations matters[/b]. Several cards require being put adjacent to other location, while others are worth more if posicioned adjacent to certain locations. This is true for types of locations (comercial, military, and so on) and also to specific locations, named in the cards. So its more important, for me, to know the cards in [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110277/among-the-stars]Among the Stars[/url]. This makes the game harder for newbies. On the other hand, build locations is easier: you don't need to deal with many resources - only money and energy.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110277/among-the-stars]Among the Stars[/url] doesn't have the cards divided in eras or phases: they are gather together to form one draw pile. Six cards per player per round are drawn. After four rounds, the game ends. The one with the most points, wins. It is possible to play with Objectives, that can give points if some requisite is met.

This is a fast game (30-45 minutes), with beautiful art and really good components (the energy cubes are something to behold).

Overall, a solid game.

Played with 3 and the basic rules and it was ok - we spent too much time reading the cards to see how they interact so at this point in time I prefer 7 Wonders as it plays so much quicker.

I do like the spacial element and this rating may go up as more plays are had

The race special powers were OK but nothing to do cheetah flips up n down the driveway about....meh

A pleasant drafting-building game that has as much interaction as, say, Race for the Galaxy. Not much, but you can certainly change what you're doing based on other players. Preferred over 7 Wonders.

RATING: 6
OK game but it seems to be lacking immersion and the feeling of "engine building"

7 Wonders is a better game of this style.

For space themed short games Race for the Galaxy beats everything 10/0

RATING: 8
An empire builder in the mold of 7 Wonders.  However, unlike 7 Wonders, Among the Stars features an open ended build system that does not force the player into monolithic strategies.  Unlike the "Wonders" that dictate conditions to path of victory, the "Base" in Among the Stars is open ended.  In other words, you create your ship in your own image.  Even the expansion cards that grant abilities support improved open ended play rather than focusing the player into a narrow strategy.

My only negative is the scoreboard.  The game area for scoring should be easy to track first with artistic direction not getting in the way.  The Among the Stars scoreboard is clever more than functional, particularly with more players.

If Among the Stars does not hit the table with your group more than 7 Wonders you are listening to too much Bach and not enough Haydn.

The basic idea - "7 Wonders with positional card play" - is fine, but this game doesn't implement it well. It removes most of the interesting aspects of 7 Wonders such as resources (and the need to purchase them) and chained card play, and unfortunately doesn't replace them with much.

And there are problems even beyond that. For one, the cards aren't sequenced in any way (another bad change from 7 Wonders), so you get lots of cards in the first round which would only be useful later, and lots of cards in the last round which would only have been useful earlier. For another, the graphic design makes it very difficult to tell what's in other players' displays, so you have to constantly ask things like "how many purple cards does everyone have?" and "does anyone have card X out?".

I am a big fan of games with a drafting mechanism, and Among The Stars is no exception. Even though I already own 7 Wonders and Fairy Tales for example, I feel like Among The Stars is still a welcome addition to my collection. For one, the game is much better with just two players, especially using the variant found here on the Geek. And the spatial element is interesting too, especially when you know which cards are in the game. I am happy to own the (mini) expansions as well, however, as the base game alone may get a little stale after a while.

Interested in this for the drafting mechanic, but turned off a bit, by supposedly lackluster 2P gameplay (which is how I play many of my games).  That combined with few components  to justify the pricetag (despite many great reviews for 3-4p).  So, I'm still just not sure.

(After 1 4p game) - WOW!   This is a quick space station building game that combines "tile/card" placement and drafting of cards.   You manage 2 currencies in order place cards all while . . . . scoring VPs.  

We played with the variable player power cardboard pieces and there were 2 end game goals up for grabs.

And it all played really quickly - especially since it was a learning game for 1/2 the table.

Basically "advanced" 7 Wonders with added spatial placement which could be interesting, but it is not; and many more different cards (I think) all with special abilities/rules text on them which makes the game much slower. Mostly solitaire even with the advanced "agressive" cards variant and far too fiddly.

This is another of those "There's nothing wrong with it, but I'm not going to ask to play it again" sorts of games, along with being one of those "I forgot we had played it by the end of the day" kinds of games.  It has some similarities to 7 Wonders, and it has some neat mechanisms that are going on during the game, but it just doesn't have that sort of OOMPH that makes it a Must Play Game.  I couldn't even tell you why.

Definitely wasn't a replacement for 7 Wonders. I didn't like how the cards are the same throughout every year. The setup and tear down is also much more involved than I liked. 7 Wonders makes this easy since you can just sort by the backs of the cards and player number. All said I would play Among the Stars again, but it is not a game I want to own as I don't want the responsibility of sorting and setup.

I think this game is a great deal of fun, though as a learning game it takes a particularly long time to play because everyone has to study every single card before making a decision. The biggest problem is that it takes up an enormous amount of table space, especially with four players, which is the main reason why I rarely get an opportunity to play it.

A city building card game where players take the role of aliens creating the greatest space stations as they rebuild from the ravages of Galactic War. Space station tiles have interacting and one off effects and placement distance from the power reactors. I like the simultaneous play aspect and the card draft system where unused cards are passed to the next player. Much of this game is remembering/keeping track what other players are building on their stations.

7.5 after one 2p game, but feels destined for a higher score.  GF and I both feel like this will be as much fun as RftG which doesnt get much play any more, but is pretty high on our list.

++ Positives
+ nice aesthetics, component quality
+ I like the square cards
+ spatial mechanic is interesting and fun
+ simple to learn
+ turns are quick, low AP
+ draft/play is tactical, physical placement is (lightly) strategic

-- Detractors
- 2p game feels fiddly with the dummy players.
- 2p has dummy players.
- game takes up a surprising amount of space.

After two more plays :

I fixed the 2p dummy hands to be less fiddly.  It's way better but still fiddly.  I will write this up if anyone cares.

With 2p/4p draft rotations you dont have many chances to see the same hand again which means you cant really plan, you just play best available.  Considering experimenting with house rules to change the draft mechanics.

Keeping the 7.5 for now.

Played the two player version that came out in 2015, which didn't really grab me in a way I thought it would. I though playing around with the power tokens and room placement would be fun, but it fell a bit flat for me. I seem to miss the feeling of a buildup; Each phase actually felt pretty similar to me (compared to 7 Wonders which has some escalation going on).

As these two games are pretty similar, I'm rating this game based on this first impression.

I mostly don't get this game. It's supposed to feel like you are building an awesome space station but it doesn't communicate well for me.

I think I may just not enjoy card drafting that much. Having played Suburbia the night before I felt like AtS was a more streamlined, elegant game making Suburbia feel fiddly in comparison. However I enjoy Suburbia more because for some reason in card drafts I tend to focus too much on denial strategies distracting me from my own tableau.

In comparison to Fairy Tales (haven't played 7 Wonders), AtS demolishes it in terms of theme, graphic design, and depth. I wish the deck setup was not so involved but it's a price I will pay every time for a game that is better in almost every way.

The most beautiful artwork in card games – period (where TtA New Story is not considered a card game :-D). As a drafting game works maybe even better than 7 wonders for me because I like spatial element better than trading and plays fine with two (of course only with entwife variant). Always tight and one of the rare games in which I can still beat my spouse. 

Big problem: heavy on play space and the worst expansion ever designed (from the perspective of someone who actively dislikes expandable card games).

A game that i helped at it's development as a play tester (update: And i co-created the first expansion for it). Started lukewarm but the more you played, the more you saw that the game has meat and many strategies. 

The drafting mechanism alone offers a very nice gaming experience and many choices but opposed to 7 Wonders (the drafting game benchmark of shorts), you can actually play all the cards and you have many more choices.

Opposed to Among the Stars, 7 Wonders seems like a luck-heavy exercise in card drafting. Sorry 7 Wonders but i will be playing Among the Stars from now on.

The cards mostly all do the same-ish thing, with little variation (get some victory points; some extra if you satisfy x or y, but not *too* much extra).

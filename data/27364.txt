Slimmed down Caylus. not as good as it's parent but plays so much quicker. The four player game is best as buildings become more important. The two player game seems to be all about the castle strategy and is less satisfying although still good tactically.

Card game version of Caylus that is much closer to Caylus than San Juan is to Puerto Rico.  If you like Caylus, you'll like this, and if not, then you probably won't.

The main differences, other than lower cost and slightly more portable, are as follows: 1)4 workers instead of 6 to place, 2)no royal favours(!), 3)you get benefits when others use your buildings, NOT points, 4)gameplay is shorter in large part due to the removal of castle tokens each round if no one built in the castle, 5)gold is rather plentiful, 6)you have other options available rather than just placing or building- you can draw another card (your buildings), or refresh your cards.  These can be useful "stall" tactics.

As per Caylus, money is tight, actions are very limited, and there's alot of strategy and depth.  I bought the game because I like Caylus, but not with more than 2-3, so I'm hoping this works well with 4 (have only played 2,3 player games so far).

This game is all I hoped it would be! I enjoy the faster approach to a Caylus-like game. I feel the game is much more manageable for a new player than Caylus, and hope that with time it could be used to lead into playing Caylus. I've only played Caylus once (which was enough), so I can't talk much about a comparison. All I know is that I played this one 4 times in 2 days when I got it... which says a lot!

Great game play, but the art and graphic design are terrible.  Need to try the advanced version before rating.

Update: Have now played the advanced version.  Better than the basic version in terms of gameplay.  Overall tho, I find the game rather, well, boring.  It definitely makes you think but it's just not that fun to play.

RATING: 7
A game with a steep learning curve, and a terrible rule-book. However, this is a game with deep strategy, very tight economy and limited resources. You can never achieve much, but if you set up a successful series of buildings, which other players choose to utilise, you can amass adequate resources to pile up the victory points. The 2 player game is very different in feel to the 4 player game. At 2 player, this is a harsh but quick game of "screw-you". The 4 player game is quite a long affair, and requires a lot of thought and concentration. For a cheap, small-boxed game, this is one of the hardest, deepest, most challenging in my collection.

Personally I prefer the original Caylus but CMC has some good qualities i.e. plays faster.

2016-03-11
Caylus Magna Carta is a product of the era when transforming popular eurogames into "lighter" card game format was all the rage. As of this writing, we are seeing the same phenomenon except that cards are replaced with dice.

But to the game itself... CMC indeed is a simplified version of the original. The result shifts the balance more to the side of tactical decisions instead of long term strategy. This is mainly because the favour tracks have been removed, and you cannot control the game length via Bailiff movement. A tiny element of luck has been introduced as well, which reduces the need for extrapolating the moves too much.

CMC is a good game. However, personally I prefer games in which you can create a grand plan that gives you a roadmap to follow, and on which you can base all your tactical decisions. This is not to say that CMC lacks the strategy element, its presence is just more apparent in the original.

Most of Caylus, but with stripped down castle section and a more varied building section. The game has all the tastes of Caylus, but without the elements that cause the game to be long. I loved this version and can see it becoming more popoular than the original as the playing time is about an hour. An essential purchase.

RATING: 8
I enjoy this game!  The mechanics aren't difficult to grasp and gameplay is pretty smooth.  A fun, enjoyable building game.  I recommend trying it.

Rating may improve with more plays.

I rather like this one.  It's pretty strategic, but even just the random draw of the card decks is enough to mix up additional plays.  Some games you're short on stone, some you're short on food.  There's enough here to keep my attention.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After a few 2-player games, I believe that this is really Caylus lite (in a good way). All the interesting decisions in Caylus are here, but the game will take 30 minutes. I have seen the game going in very different directions depending on money availability and the cards in play. There is therefore variability, but not too much room for surprise. From this point of view I like San Juan, Race for the Galaxy or Glory to Rome more, but still it is not a bad card game. Much easier to explain than these "competitor" games.

My husband and I have friends that like Caylus (the original). My husband can't stand it. I got Magna Carta so as a lighter alternative. With a quick review of the rules, Magna Carta seems to eliminate some of the fiddly mechanics of the original version. Played a 2 player game with beginner rules - took 2 hours including reading the rules for the first time, which is pretty good in my books. If you like classic worker placement, resource management games in the Puerto Rico and Caylus style, but want something shorter and more suitable for 2 players, Caylus Magna Carta fits the bill. The game itself is well designed in terms of practicality - you can quickly look at a card and tell what it does. IMO, better than the original Caylus. But it's not my thing - it's very dull, no ounce of fun, felt like I was pushing derniers and cubes around. I  would rather play a worker placement game that is nicer looking, more simple, and elegant - such as Keythedral.

{1 play, 3 players} It's easy to scoff at the preponderance of game "sequels" and "spin-offs" these days.  But this one is not only clever, it's better than the original, say I.  Okay, point of fact, I don't really care for the original much (I rate it a 6 out of respect), but it does have some clever stuff that is, unfortunately, married to a long playing time (worse, you feel it) and dry, repetitive turns.  Well dang me if they didn't extract all the great stuff from the board game and turn it into a nifty little card game with most of the same delicious decisions, maybe half the playing time, and (though I suspect many true Caylus players could hate this) just a bit of luck that essentially comes with the card game territory.  Now, I've only played once, so grain of salt, etc... but I cannot imagine EVER playing the board game again when this exists as an option.  That said, I can see not playing either of them down the line - there's just something "unfun" to me about the whole Caylus system - but for now, this one really surprised me.  I do wish the cube colors were better, though.

Game length - an issue in our first 4P play - is the only thing I expect to make a difference on this, because I like almost all of the game elements.  Caylus lite, still feels quite like Caylus, buildings felt more player-owned to me because they came from a deck/hand and have the secondary benefits.  I think highly experienced players will know when and how to run down the clock with build batches or a lack thereof, but if your game features one-only rounds of castle pieces it can run a really long time.  Haven't played Caylus in ages and this makes me want to revisit it.  Plays well with two.

In the end, the whole concept of a "portable Caylus" turns out to be kind of a red herring; for the time and thought investment, you might as well just play Caylus. Also, in the meantime, other worker placement games I'm far more interested in have come out.

The card version of Caylus.  This game plays amazingly similar to Caylus and I think of it as Caylus light.  In general I find teaching people with Magna Carta to be easier and less likely to scare away those who are not into the deep strategic games like Caylus.  The added element of drawing cards I like better than the open buy in the original game but it lacks much of the depth that makes Caylus as popular as it is.  I am considering converting the tiles into a deck of cards for the original game and see how that plays.  A little randomness can be a good thing.

RATING: 7.5
First, the negative. The artwork is atrocious. There is no board, all you see is the cards snaking across the table in a "road" to the castle, so you'd have thought that the designers would make them attractive, but they're pig ugly. Worse, they're not even very functional. Most of the card is empty background. There's a bit of art, showing a building or market stall or similar, but it is small and plain. The important information, ie what the card does, is tiny. One card allows you to spend a coin to buy one of three types of good, but the cubes overlap and are so small that it is very hard to read close up, yet alone across the table. There's the same problem with the castle tokens. These only have one piece of information to convey, victory points - I cannot fathom why these numbers were not made bigger and so easier to read, it's not like there's anything else on the tokens.
The game however is excellent. I've only played with three and it works very smoothly, coming in at about an hour. The scoring in every game has been tight, just like every turn. It's not so much what you do - place a worker on a card, add a card to the road, pass - as when you do it. Order is everything, because this is a game of denial of opportunity: the action you don't do now might not be available when you turn next comes around.

RATING: 6
+ Caylus Magna Carta (the card game of Caylus) is a tough workerplacement game. You build along a road and send workers to those buildings to collect resources. If another player 'uses' your building, you collect a small bonus.

+/- Really cut-throat: you're always short of money, resources of workers!

Initial rating after 2x 2-player games   1 4er. A slightly streamlined, slightly more random card game version of the original Caylus. My first game was a cube rich but cash poor game where we focussed on the castle building. My 2nd game was a cash rich game with few cubes, a handful of castle builds and 2 prestige buildings. The pacing of the resource engine seemed clunky and slow with neither game really getting any momentum to speak of. I suspect the game is better with more players (opposite end of the player spectrum compared to Caylus). So far I much prefer Caylus, despite the longer playing time.

RATING: 6
Nekem a táblás Caylus (egyik kedvencem) jobban tetszik, pont a komolysága, komplexitása veszik el azzal, hogy csináltak belőle egy könnyedebb kártyajátékot:) Ez így már nem ugyanaz az élményszint. Ha nem ismerném a Caylust, akkor lehet, hogy elaléltem volna a Magna Cartától, mert egyébként elég sokat visszaad a Caylusból. A különbség az (többek között), hogy itt a szerencse szerepe elég nagy a kártyák húzogatása miatt.

Take Caylus, throw away the board and all of the cloth resource. Keep most of the basic mechanics, tweak a few rules, now you have Magna Carta.

Only one play so far and that with two players.  I can already see this one becoming one of my favorites.  I haven't played Caylus or Caylus-like games, so I put this between San Juan and Puerto Rico as far as complexity and possibly more enjoyable than both of those.  We'll see what more plays does to my view.

Got another play a couple nights ago, this time with four players.  This was tons of fun.  I can't wait to play again.  This game pushed it closer to the Puerto Rico side of the scale for me.  Lots of options, important to watch what other people are doing and what they may be targeting, and sufficient randomness that I think this will remain intresting for many many plays.

Tän vuoden puolella tullut tuplattua pelimäärä kolmesta kuuteen, ja osakkeet on kyllä nousussa. Cayluksesta riittävästi eroava pelidynamiikka (Geekistä katottu...;) ) tekee pelistä ihan omansa, joten se oikeastaan kilpailee Cayluksen kanssa pelipöytäpaikasta, eikä siis ole se kevyempi vaihtoehto, jona sitä alunperin piti. Peli ottaa kumminkin reilusti aikaa, eikä todellakaan ole mikään läpsyttelypeli. Kestosta pitäisi kumminkin silpaista reilusti pois, jotta innostaisi vielä enemmän. (17.3.2009)

The cardgame version of the highly acclaimed boardgame Caylus Magna Carta is actually a better game than it's parent. The game is more streamlined but retains most of the intricacies found in the boardgame. Where the boardgame seems too much like work most of the time this game is actually fun. It's also faster, easier to learn and portable. So it seems Magna Carta has condemded Caylus to the trade list.

Just one play with beginner rules... I need to find someone who will get into this game with me.  My wife isn't really too interested in playing this one again.

Second play with standard rules... as dull as the first.  I feel like there is a great, fairly deep game inside.  However, the two of us haven't been able to discover it yet and I'm not sure if we are going to bother investing the time again to check it out.

Now that I've played Caylus a few times and really enjoyed it, maybe this game would be okay.  Unfortunately, I bought it for a two player game to play with my wife and that won't be happening.

Traded.

The game works well as a 2-player.  I was a little surprised that my wife liked it, since she normally doesn't like a lot of rules or complexity.  However, you can do clever combinations that benefit you, and she enjoyed figuring these out and pulling them off.  If you think San Juan is too random (and I think it is but only a little bit) then this is an excellent alternative.  Language-neutral components are a bonus in my family, as well.  

It's a bit long for what it is, in my opinion, which you don't hear about since people are comparing it to the (very long) boardgame version.  My most recent game with three players took about 90 minutes.  But an interesting game, one of the better games of the "place pawns to get cubes and trade cubes for victory points" sort, which almost always are long games.

RATING: 6
1 play.  Long game.  Perhaps because we were new to the game and very tired... but I blame it on the lack of double-cube production buildings for the entire first half of the game.  Fun to try to figure out which of the buildings in your hand of cards will be most profitable for you and other players... and how soon you should play those cards/buildings.  Plenty of long turns and over-analysis.  Still it's a good game and probably fixes the lack-of-luck problem that some people have with Caylus.  The quality of the cards in the Rio Grande version is fair at best (not sure about versions from other publishers)... the black boarder on cards was a poor choice, and there was plenty of "chipping" at card edges with white showing through the black ink... plus, I hate trying to shuffle and play with the small cards.

This is definitely NOT a card game.  This is a board game made up of cards.  This has the great feel of Caylus but tailored down to the point where it will ALMOST play during lunch.  Even though I love all the options and complexity of Caylus, Magna Carta sacrifices the _RIGHT_ set of game play options to maintain a tense, conflicted race of VP development with a much smaller time investment.  If I have an hour, I want to play Magna Carta.  If I have 2 hours, I want to play Caylus.  Perfect!

As I think about this game, I realize that it is a good game.  Initially, I was bothered by the random allocation of the buildings and the fact that it often does little good to play a second building of the same type.  However, there are enough good buildings that everyone will get to "own" a desired building.  I like the tradeoff between doing more things and being first in line for the gold cube at the castle.  Money does not seem to be as big as issue as it is in the original game.  Overall, a game that I will play again.

I won my first game of this almost entirely without properly understanding it; I had no idea how to make the resource engine work, so couldn't afford any buildings, and especially not the big, expensive ones which give you lots of points - so I traded myself rich and bought VPs with abandon; and somehow that seemed to work. I expect it won't do so next time; and since I still don't understand the rest of the game at all, I will do very badly indeed.

Nice, easy-to-learn card game with some very tense, competitive gameplay. It is often tricky to calculate whether short-term points in the castle chips will outweigh the points you make with the prestige buildings.

UPDATE: OK, it's true, CMC doesn't suck. But it doesn't quite work either, the card-drawing engine is out of whack. That's OK, though, it's close enough. But it's just a bit too long, and a bit too boring, and a bit too themeless, to really grab me. I'm far more taken with San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, especially given that CMC weighs in at double the length of either game, or more. I see this leaving my collection soon.
---
Hey, this one doesn't seem to suck. It's Caylus with all the excess, unbalanced junk ripped out, and it plays cleanly and much more smoothly. The building seem much more appropriately-valued, instead of being the tail that wags the dog. The game is of sensible length, and there are legitimate interesting decisions instead of just figuring out which aspects of the game aren't (or are, depending on your point of view) broken - it won't spawn dozens of strategy articles because it basically seems to work, so there are no hidden gotchas and pointy edges. It seems to finish a just a touch before it feels like it wants to end, but if the game were any longer, that wouldn't be so good either, so what can you do.

It still doesn't get in an 8 in my view because the card-drawing mechanic doesn't quite work - there really is no tension in the card draws, and cycling your hand is much too cheap, so that part of the game doesn't feel right. I think the designers were probably paranoid about players getting hosed by card draw distributions, but as it is, card-related activities seem significantly underpriced, you could just pay a buck to draw whatever card you want. But otherwise, I thought it was pretty good.

Most (all?) Ystari games I've played have faded hard and fast after a couple plays, but I'm optimistic CMC will do better. Not a classic, but decent and much cleaner than previous entries.

ADDENDA: I've played with 3, and it's possible there are scaling issues with 2 or 4. But 3 seems to work well enough.

A simpler card-based version of Caylus sounds like a great idea, but this one was a failure in my opinion.  A couple of new mechanics, but on the whole, it is vegetarian Caylus.  What made Caylus interesting is not preserved in this game. I think with 4, the game makes sense as a quicker way to play a Caylus-like game.  With 2 or 3 though, you might as well just play the real thing, as the play time is not all that improved.

Caylus is one of my favorite games. Therefore, I was looking very much forward to play the card version of it. Having played it a couple of times in July for the first time, I think I can say that it’s a good game, but if you already own Caylus, it’s not mandatory to own this one, and I would probably choose to play regular Caylus over Caylus Magna Carta most of the times.

I was surprised to see how much the game actually reminded me of Caylus! It’s not just a spin-off which plays radically differently than the original game, no, CMC actually feels a lot like Caylus! As we all know, Caylus is devoided of any luck, and given the fact that CMC uses cards, I thought it would add a lot of luck. I’m happy to say that this is not the case! There is far less luck than what I expected from a so-called “card game” – in reality, it’s not as much a card game as it’s more of a board game that uses cards as tiles. The only luck is basically which buildings you draw, but this doesn’t have a big impact on the outcome of the game as it doesn’t cost much to draw new cards, you can discard your whole hand for a small cost and the fact that you can discard your starting hand once for free.  

While the gameplay plays much like Caylus, there are actually several small differences which make the game different. To me, most of the differences make the game worse than Caylus. For instance, CMC features no favor track, has a fixed turn order, has a different and more boring castle batch-mechanic, has fewer resources (no cloth), fewer workers, a limited amount of buildings as they are determined by your hand, the carpenter/stone mason/architect buildings don’t exist so you can build more freely, no “time limit progression” as you don’t have to wait until the bailiff reaches a certain spot on the road (as there is no bailiff) and finally, you don’t get VPs when your opponents use your buildings. These are just some of the subtle changes, and though it might seem like there are many differences, the gameplay feels a lot like Caylus.

The best thing about CMC is probably the faster playing time compared to its big brother, but actually the game isn’t that short even with 2 or 3 players. It lasts for about an hour, and after my three games I’ve always felt it overstayed its welcome by about 10-15 minutes; it’s not a filler card game of the original game, like San Juan is to Puerto Rico; CMC has a listed time of 75 minutes, and my 2p and 3p games have lasted for 50-65 minutes, and we’re quite fast players. Therefore I think it’s perhaps slightly too long for what it offers. My biggest gripe with the game is probably this: why would I choose to play CMC instead of Caylus? They are so much alike, and even though CMC is the shorter game, I think regular Caylus offer much more interesting decisions during the gameplay. As the games remind me of each other, I don’t see a reason to own both (unless you’re a collector and own 500+ games or so), so I’m probably going to sell this game – even though it’s actually a quite good “card” game! If I didn’t own Caylus, this would definitely be staying in my collection.

Not sure about it yet.  My 2-player game seemed to rocket to an end.  And it mostly consisted of us either struggling to accumulate enough for a batch or struggling to build, in which case 2 of the already small numbers of castle tokens went away.  Thus, it felt like the game just zoomed to an end without much development.  Will try again.

Doesn't feel so much like a new game as a heavily streamlined variant. It removes most of the minor things I didn't like in the original. I think what I most love about Caylus is its baroque complexity. So I think I will prefer the original in the long run. This version retains the core of the game and looks like it should play a bit shorter. Although our 4 player game did take two and a half hours. I like the random draw of buildings that the other players can play. It does add a tiny luck element but it removes the static potential for every game to be the same in the original.

It's Caylus *like* not Caylus "Lite" - and better than its predecessor in many ways.  It takes the best of Caylus, looses the oddness of the royal favors, and takes less time.  

You get the sense that this game's designer played Caylus many times, and then improved on it.

An excellent game that can be played in under 60 minutes.

Did I mention you can carry it in a pocket?

That having been said, I prefer the stone/wood buildings of Caylus, as well as the additional "on board" buildings.

I'd gladly play either depending on the time I have to play and how deeply I want to think.

pros: travel-friendly; less complex than the board game and therefore better suited for introducing casual players to the wonderful world of Caylus; good 3-player logistics game.

cons: not really interesting, complex or compelling enough for Caylus board game fans; Chinese card stock quality made in Europe; feels awkward in 2-player mode (don't care for 2-player Caylus either); amateur artwork.

Some people seem to like this better than the original.  The mechanics are certainly familiar, but it really strikes me as a totally different game.  It seems to have much less subtlety than the original, and you certainly can't translate the stratagies of one directly to the other.  However, to be fair, I have not played a complete game yet.

Ok card game. Not as good as the original but cuts down on some elements to simplify the game. I also like the simple castle VP scoring although it tends to dominate. Need to play a bit more to see if it's a keeper but I worry its a little dull and dry. Game length also stops it being played over bigger board games so it rarely hits the table.

This game succeeds in that it feels a lot like Caylus in play.  It seems a little simpler, but not to a great degree.  There were still plenty of difficult choices.  It was a little shorter in play time and a little less in set up time - otherwise, I'm not sure that there's a clear choice in picking one game over the other.

After glancing through the rules and seeing Cyril Demaegd demonstrate the game on a [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=tv&inf=tv_flash&ref=68]video[/url], I decided that if I were going to play Caylus at all (see my comments over there), it'd be this title. CMC appears, in my opinion, the superior game because it captures the essence of Caylus without piling a lot of extra details and mechanisms on top. Of course, it will not hold the same amount of strategic appeal, but a game should be playable too. So, after giving the game a whirl at all player numbers, what do I think of it? 

Well, I like it better than its big brother, and so do the people I played it with. It's less cluttered, it takes less time, it gives a more pronounced feeling of control over what you're doing, there's still a lot of tough decisions to be made, and the game appears a lot more variable because of the card drafting and a lack of pink buildings (especially at low player numbers). CMC achieves all this at the expense of 'deep' stragegy, additional layers of game mechanics and a helluvalot of player-induced chaos. In my opinion, the expense is worth every penny. 

That is not to say I wholeheartedly agree with the game. It is at heart a multiplayer rich-get-richer game, which needs to be timed in such a way that the big payoff occurs when the game ends. Unfortunately, it is hard for players to interfere with one another, and by the time the richest are preparing to build prestige buildings, resource buildinds which are still useful for the poor are being shut down. A player in the rear has no defenses against this, and might as well give up. There really is no point in continuing. In other words, CMC's mechanisms still require players who have some idea of what they're doing in order to prevent their falling behind. For if that happens, they are out. I consider this a flaw of the system. Now catch-up mechanics other than the provost would probably have lead to a clunky game, so I can't have everything. (In fact, I think the provost is too tame. People rarely have sufficient funds to move him about.) At least CMC allows for some post mortem-analysis.

In terms of presenting the mechanisms which make Caylus Caylus, CMC does a much better job in less time. At the same time, it shows quite clearly its basic structure with all its strengths and weaknesses. Time will tell if I'll be able to master the weaknesses sufficiently to survive and even win a game. But I can sure appreciate the game a lot better.

[b]Update[/b] Note to self: next time you play, note the conversion rate of resources and money into points. It really is rather silly to pour tons of resources into castle parts which have a lousy ROI. (The walls have you spending one point to gain two at the last, for example.)

Components: Needs cheatsheets about round order and turn options. In my copy, the yellow pieces are actually orange. I think the entire face of each card should match a player's color, rather than having blue and yellow as the dominant color, even though the card might belong to green.

Experience: Interesting how the availability, cost, and value of resources changes throughout the game. It's very difficult to weigh the relative worth of actions; spend one turn earning three points or three turns earning ten? Being able to play some popular cards early on could make a huge difference, especially if it has a permanent, free reward for the owner. As the path grows longer (even with some getting converted to residences and prestige buildings) the number of options increase, and the game plays more slowly.

I received this as a Christmas or Birthday gift from Lorne and Sherry Cornish, after having given the same game to Lorne the previous year.  It is a card game version of the board game Caylus, which is one of my favourite games.  It is a good adaptation, keeping consistent with most of Caylus' rules.  It simplifies the game by removing blue cubes and favours from the game.  It is a lighter and faster game than Caylus.

After 2 plays. Certainly of more interest than Caylus (not difficult), but in both cases the game played over 2 hours, which is certainly too long if repeated on a regular basis. I was reasonably confident that the first experience was not representative, but may be it's our group think. Give it 2.1, very slightly better than Caylus, because it is very slightly less offensive than Caylus.

Boils down Caylus to the coolest part: the building track.  But instead of that producing a fast tight game, it just shows how overblown regular Caylus is.  This game is still pretty involved, and is NOT a quick game like San Juan.  It is a real game.  And in that light, some of the little things that you could swing in a light game hurt more since this is a full game.  No handicapping for turn order?

Fun game.  Not nearly as good as Caylus, but still enjoyed it quite a bit.  In my one game, money was tight.  There is no Trading Post to get 3 deniers.  So visits to the market are much more common.  Our game dragged because, on many turns, only one batch was build in the castle.  Maybe we missed a rule to remove the second VP marker in this circumstance.  Glad we finally got this to the table.

Caylus the card game.  Players take turns to build a card from their hand, dump their hand, draw into their hand, or deploy workers out to the board (made up of built cards).  The rest of the game is essentially Caylus (earn cubes, turn cubes into victory points).  The colour purple, and the associated royal favours are gone, and it's all much cleaner.  Quicker and therefore much better than the original boardgame.  If you need to play Caylus, play this; if you need to play Caylus with a board, find a copy of Age of Empires III.

This leaves out my favorite part of Caylus (the favor track) while keeping my least favorite part (the provost).  I thought I would like the added randomness, but it turns out to just be annoying when you don't have the buildings you want in your hand so you have to pay to draw.  It's shorter than Caylus but still too long-- our 4-player game was 2.5 hours.

This isn't much shorter than regular Caylus.  It's not nearly as interesting strategically as Caylus either.  Just play Caylus.  What's up with these card versions of games we love?  They're like reading footnotes for a great book.  All the great games have okay to poor card games.  I don't think this could happen to movies.  "Honey I only have a 1/2 hour, so I can only watch the mini version of Raiders of the Lost Ark."  I don't think you will ever hear that sentence.  Why rush greatness?

Like it's big brother, CMC is a strategic gem. While there is validity to the argument that this game isn't different enough from Caylus to warrant owning both, I am pleased to have both in my collection. The simple fact is that even though this card game will never have the heavy depth that Caylus brings, it does provide me with some of the same enjoyable decisions. And since it is more elegantly simplified, due to removing the favors system, CMC will get on my table way more than Caylus ever will.

A nagy kedvenc kis testvére. A hangulat ugyanaz, de némileg könnyebben játszható, kezdőkkel is meg lehet próbálni. Gyorsabb játék, 1 órából megvan.
Hm. Rég játszottunk elővettük, igaz a Ystari boxos kiegjével...háát. így nem rövid: 3 órás parti volt, ami talán picit gyorsabbá tehető, de akkor is 2 fölött...és csak 4-en voltunk....Vagy a kieg lassít rajta ennyit, vagy nem tudom. Most így bizonytalanná tett, h valóban 9-es-e...Mert ha gyors lenne megérné. Így h időben Caylus hosszúságú volt, így nem: a Caylus több-jobb. Pedig jó a játék, ha belefér 1,5 órába nagy királyság lenne: caylus feeling pörgetve. Ugye a nagy különbség, h nincs tábla és mindenki saját paklival nyomul, illetve na és csak udvarnagy van. A kiegtől ugye bekerülnek a királyi kegyek is....és így lassul, a dolog, alap esetben csak arany szerezhető, így a királyi keggyel sok extra is....varia
Update:
Nos újra teszt alá véve, ismét kieggel: 1 óra 15 perc. Tehát gyors a játék. Akkor lasullhat be, ha midnen körben csak 1 -esetleg néha 2- várelem fogy. Most 3x dobtunk mert nem vett senki /6 elem, rossz esetben +6 kör/ és a pénzért vásárol várelem lap is kint volt, 7 várelem fogyott: újabb rosz esetben 7 plusz kör, ah nincs, összesen 10-13 kör ha ezek nem pluszba, ami nagyjából 1-1,5 óra. Azaz?: ha vki mindenki körben vesz 1 várelemet és néha vesznek összesen 2-t, akkor elhúzódhat. HA ez nincs, akkor gyors pörgős játék. Marad. :-)

I like this card version of Caylus MUCH more than the original.  Rather than fiddly scoring opportunities in a variety of ways, this streamlines the "castle" idea and gets rid of that track in the right corner of the original's board.  Fun stuff and well worth the price of admission.

Very good game with a very simple problem: it's worse than Caylus. The big brother is more interesting and is not really longer. The only good point is that the box is smaller but this is not a travel game, you'll need a table big enough to play it.

Traded for Carcassonne.

Played a few rounds and just wasn't impressed. Also, I thought I was buying the original Caylus, not CMC, when I picked it up. I should learn to read.

In retrospect, played this before I knew much (or anything) about worker placement games. I'd probably have a different perspective on this now.

UPDATE: Played it again. It's more interactive and confrontational than many worker placement games which is nice (too many WP games are just four people sitting in silence starting at their game mats for two hours) but I feel that there are games in this genre that have surpassed this one.

An economic machine game (build up your infrastructure so you can go out and get those all-important Victory Points) that is both approachable and meaty. 

From everything I've read, C:MC is a significant notch easier than Caylus while keeping some of the meat, sort of like a Puerto Rico - San Juan connection.

Enjoyed my first play and would be happy to try it again. It took a lot longer than it said on the box though (4 players, 3 new) and was a bit of a brain burner.

RATING: 4
I don't mind complex games so it's usually not a good idea for me to start with a complex game and then play a more  simplified version of the same game.  Sadly, I believe I owned Caylus Magna Carta before I played Caylus.  That's all that I can really say about CMC.  I'm sure it would be a good game to start people on before Caylus if they aren't into heavier games or just a decent game, if you're not looking for a game that isn't long and heavy.

Better than the boardgame. Plays faster, for one, and is not so heavily computational as the boardgame. Still not that great a game though. There's no real sense of excitement in gameplay, as the game encourages you to adopt an optimal strategy and it's just a matter of who can execute that strategy in the most efficient manner - that is the winner.

[2 plays] First timeI played this, I just noticed it wasn’t as annoying as Caylus, which was a pleasant surprise.  The second time out, the memory of Caylus had largely faded, and CMC just seemed like a moderately agreeable game in its own right.  I don’t think it’s going to become a favorite, but it’s all right.  Thing to remember for next time: it’s all about getting to the blue buildings.

RATING: 7
A shorter, simpler version of Caylus. That will work for some, for others it seems superfluous. While you lose some of the depth of the original, I find the game is still not without interest. 

The players each have an identical deck of building cards, and getting them out is as much of the game as is using them. You want to get your version of something out before others do, and you have choices of putting out something unique to attract other players or something identical which gives you the option of not using an opponent's building. 

When players use one of your buildings, you don't get VPs but rather a secondary benefit (like stone or wood or food). Production buildings have to be flipped over before you can build a VP building on top, and at game end this process becomes frantic and turn order becomes paramount. 

No, not as good as its progenitor but a reasonably good game that can be played in less time, especially for my AP prone group. Not that I'd choose CMC over Caylus, but it's not a bad option for 3P when you don't have a lot of time.

I think Caylus is pretty good but this takes half the time and is easier to teach to newbies.

Some Caylus purists turn up their noses at Magna Carta and refuse to play it but I think they both have their merits.

RATING: 6
(2-4 players) Well, they definitely fixed the long playing time issue but the production curve and the general progression of the game still feels rather clunky to me, and maybe even worse so since cards can be built at any time during the game. Just like Caylus it seems like you barely are able to get to the Residences and Prestige buildings before the game is over.  And whereas Caylus has a relatively programmed sequence of resource development, in this version everyone has to deal with random card draws to determine what can be built. Will have to try it a few more times.

Caylus is back on my radar with my interest in deeper games; this condensed version is a lot of fun.

I'm impressed at how they slimmed it down: one cube colour has been removed, Gold is a wildcard resource, privileges are just Gold, and the bailiff has been incorporated into the provost.

The non-standard card sizes are ridiculous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This rating is for family play with the beginner rules (it comes with two rules options).  The standard rules version might get to be a grind for me- I have to watch out for heavy economic games.  I like the systems but I'm not very good at them and I can loose interest if it's a long numbers puzzle.  Anyway, it plays quick with lots of options and we never know who will win until the end.  It scratches that classic euro, cube collecting, VP counting itch in a fun way. For me (playing the lighter rules) it's in a group like Notre Dame and St. Petersburg.

I like small and streamlined games, but sometimes a game is too streamlined and efficient.

I just can't get into these sort of games. They feel a bit too dry for me. Maybe I am shallow and just like some good old fighting or direct interaction, but Caylus MC just bored me. The design seems to work nicely for what it is. But what it is just isn't my kind of game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Dare I say it; this game is much cleaner and crisper than its boardgame counterpart and just might see more table time than it's elder sibling.

But there are important differences in Caylus which I find preferable; the shared building mix, the increased cost in placing workers when others pass, the subtleties of certain buildings and the greater significance of the bailiff piece.

Of course, the whole character of the original is more sophisticated; but with increased competition at the castle and different strategy options this is an engrossing, slightly more portable, alternative
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
a little bit less complex than the original. However, about same length of playing time. Not quite as good as the original (which has a 10 with me) which I would prefer at any time. What is VERY good however is that the order of types of buildings that appear during the game are definitely more varied than in the original. I don't think that Magna Carta works with just 2 players very good (I played with 4).

For almost everybody, this one is probably as good as Caylus or even better. In fact, the game has been streamlined and there is more emphasis on building.

Moreover, it is way too similar in feeling to the original game so I downgrade it to a 9 just because I prefer truly original games.

A játék elég csúnyácska, de nem zavaróan. A játékmenet érdekes mechanizmusokból áll, ám csontszáraz. Kicsit több tematika elfért volna nekem benne.

I was quite suprised by how close CMC is to its progenitor Caylus rules-wise. Unlike many other cases this really is a very faithful card game conversion of the board game. Of course, they did drop a few options from the original and while that does not seem to shorten the playtime by any significant amount of time it does limit the strategic scope quite a bit which, at least to me, makes it somewhat less interesting.

I therefore probably wouldn't choose Magna Carta over Caylus. Unless I had only three players. Caylus itself clearly benefits from more, CMC seems to be better suited for three players (or, some seem to suggest, fewer).

I've always been curious about Caylus MC. I couldn't really remember why, other than it has the Caylus name. Now that I've played it, I can say that I'm glad I did, but I don't think I'd every choose it over Caylus. It really does replicate about 90% of Caylus, so why not push it to the original? Perhaps MC is best for newer players. It does simplify some mechanics - ones that felt somewhat obtuse in the board game version. Also, the idea of using cards for buildings and having your own hand is a neat idea, but I don't feel like it was so revolutionary to make MC feel like a completely separate game.

My relation is that it is like a live album from your favourite band, only to hear that they play everything note-for-note. Impressive, but why not just listen to the studio album instead?

I'm sure it gets easier with a couple of more games played. A good game all in all.

Much better than Caylus, but I still don't care what King Philip the Fair wants. And the provost sucks - the ability to influence the provost costs this game 2 or 3 rating points for me. 

I discovered this evening that there's a "basic game" which has no provost. I think that game's much better than the official rules so I've increase my rating to a 7.

Do I like this more than the original Caylus?  I am not sure.  It is more forgiving and lighter, which I appreciate, but I miss some of the tiles and of course the King's Favor when you add to the castle.  The game doesn't seem to be as brutal, but it does have the advantage of your card draw which prevents a scripted moves.  Also, you get a different 'board' each time which I appreciate.

Update: Well, the expansion adds a lot to what I was missing before. Just the addition of favors alone makes this much more appealing to me.

This comment comes after my first play of Caylus Magna Carta, where I did not understand many of the rules (none of us did).  Despite winning that game, I feel that this game will take some getting used to before an accurate assessment can be made.  It looks like Caylus, but the way we played it, there was not much that people could do except grab some resources and try to snaffle some victory points with them.  Yup, that's about it.

This game will probably appeal greatly to those who would appreciate a slimmed down version of Caylus. The game involves some building, some resource gathering and some consideration of how best to collect the victory points, which, in the early game at least, comes mostly from relinquishing batches of resources for the building of a castle. When we started the game, I thought it would involve a lot of building and resource gathering, but I quickly found that the resources were much scarcer than I had anticipated. In other words, if you think of this in the same way as the typical resource gathering game, you may be a bit surprised. Though it sounds rather complex at first, the gameplay is actually quite easy to pick up. Once things began to flow, I found myself very deeply engaged and thinking ahead about what I needed to do to maximize my victory point total. This is an engaging game that strikes a nice balance between strategic depth and accessibility.

I do enjoy the decisions surrounding the use of buildings near the end of the road. Can be very easy to mess up and lose out on one or two of your worker placements because you passed in the wrong position or kept one too few coins.

Every game feels different. This is largely due to the length of the game being much too short to see more than 1/3 of your hand cards reach the table. Because of this, from game to game Caylus MC can play out very differently. It will see much more play because of this.

What a superfluous trend to simplifiy successful games.
Would you like to see simplified paintings in the museum (Mona Lisa without background)?
Would you listen to simplified music (only the base line)?

Played 5. I seem to like this game more than the people I have introduced it to. I think it is a lovely conversion of the Caylus boardgame to a card game. If I had an extra 20 minutes I would still prefer to play the board game. I have enjoyed it as a 2 player and a 3 player game. Yet to try it with 4. June 07

*UPDATE* It has taken me 7 years to get there but I have Just played my 10th game. This is still coming in at 90 minutes with 3 players and I can't see that ever speeding up. Spending this length of time on such a "little" game has given me a problem in the past but 10 plays in and I'm over myself on this issue. I'll except this game is not a filler but a full session game that provides the clout to compete with any of the 90 minute full fat euros out there. April 2014

Slightly simpler version of Caylus. I use it as "Caylus: The Travel Edition" since it uses cards instead of a board. The base game of Magna Carter is mildly simpler than the board game, but you can add The Favors expansion (via the "Ystari Box") and basically play the full game of Caylus. Stick to the C:MG base game and you'll have that great Caylus fun in almost half the time.

This game has two versions: beginner rules, and standard rules.  I think it's actually better overall with the beginner rules.  Rather than play Magna Carta with the standard rules, you might as well just play Caylus.  With the beginner rules it's still similar (and inferior) to the original game, but at least it's a LITTLE more different.

There is more depth than in your average card game, but it just lacks a bit more fun. Get resources, build stuff to get more resources or money, gain VPs. Been there, done that. Besides, the game flow seems very dependent on what is drawn and built, easily being over before any blue buildings come into play, for example. Not a bad game, but nothing compelling about it.

RATING: 6.5
After one play, I like this game better than the original Caylus.  It can still be a long game (3 hours) with many difficult decisions, but since there are less options of buildings to buy than in Caylus, it's easier to grasp the game as a whole, even at a first playing.

Similar to Caylus, you need to react to the scarcity of resources in the particular game that you are in.  If it's going to be a money-poor game, there is an advantage to withdrawing early while everyone else spends their cash -- and you should try to build the first lawyer.  If it's going to be a stone-poor game, don't spend too much time holding stone buildings -- trade them in for other ones that will be easier to build, or try to grab all the stone and play the building that produces 2 stone before another player can.

It's interesting that you get all the same set of buildings as others, but not necessarily the exact same buildings because you draw them randomly.  Hand management becomes an important part of the game, and one that wasn't part of Caylus.

One important erratum/missing rule:  there is no description of one of the blue buildings (called the Library), the one with a picture of a green card on it.  It is *not* like the lawyer -- it doesn't let you upgrade a building to a Residence.  Instead, it allows you to draw a card when you get your 2 deniers at the beginning of the turn (which is pretty cool -- it could give you a 2- or 3- point building late in the game without requiring you to take an action or a denier to draw it).

After a few more plays of this game, I've gotten a much better feel for the game.  I like the solid balance between points from prestige buildings and points from castle batches.  Even if you aren't getting much from buildings in general, you can grab a lot of early batches for both gold and points.  It's not so much a multiple paths to victory mechanic as it is just a number of options and timings as to how you get what you need.  I do like the worker placement element and how the building benefits work.  Every game we've played, the scoring has been pretty tight.

A few cons though - the provost feels like an artificial timer and money sink of screwage.  I also don't like that you can spend 1 denar to draw one card, or to discard all of your cards and draw a new hand.  It seems silly to have the same cost but more cards.  

The randomness of the cards can be a slight irritant - if you happen to draw the same buildings that are being played, you have to dump all of your money to try and get more useful buildings that will be utilized.  I just can't grasp the building aspect and seem to just focus on batches and prestige buildings for points, rather than the mini-economy.

Overall I like the game a lot but there are a few aspects that make me prefer the worker placement of Agricola instead.

Caylus Magna Carta does a nice job of preserving the flavour and most of the play of Caylus, without the big board.

Instead of tiles, players each have similar decks of building cards, making tile availability a bit easier, but also adding in a random ordering with the shuffle, requiring deniers to move additional cards from their deck.

In fact, the play is so similar, there are only a few pieces (such the turn-order bid, and the Favors which change the play from Caylus.

I think these make the game not quite as satisfying (if less brain-burning), but also a little faster to play, and very portable.

After a 1st solo 4-player game, I'll start this at a 7.

Caylus Magna Carta is a gamer's game still, but perhaps the slight differences hold this one back a little from the full experience of Caylus.

First played June 27th, 2007.  This will take a bit to teach/learn(15min).  It will also take a bit more than an hour to play (w/4player).  It has great luck/strategy balance and is a very enjoyable game.  Of course you may not think so if you are intimidated by many options.  It will take a game play to figure out what to do as well.  After playing a few rounds you will get the hang of it as well.  Consider the first game play a learning experience.  I'd highly recommend giving this a gameplay and consideration into your rotation of games to play on a regular basis.  I haven't played Caylus yet, however it's my understanding that this is a quicker-lighter weight game.  With that said, it will probably reach out to more people.  Update: this does seem to play well with 2 players, however it is a completly different game and made both of our heads spin a bit.  It reminded me a bit of Tigris & Euphrates in that it was a taxing on the brain.

Based on a couple of games with 3 and 4 players. I much prefer this card-based version to the original board game - all the gain without the pain. Actually my glib witticism does not quite hold true. Caylus MC is still more fiddly than need be and could, perhaps, have sacrificed a few more components to the god of thrifty game design; each player having his own pack of building cards doesn't seem to serve any useful function. The game also lasts too long for what it offers.

I very much enjoyed this revision of Caylus.  It eliminates most of what I don't like about Caylus, and emphasizes the interesting bits.  In that way, I feel better about it than say San Juan to Puerto Rico (not that I don't like San Juan, but it just has a very different flavor to me).  My one grip is that the first two sections of the game (building the castle dungeon and walls) blow by.  Then, in the final section -- building the turrets -- it slows way down.  This may be by design, but I think the pacing is a little off.

After 1 play.

It is OK game - elegant, with smoothly working mechanics, decisions/strategies are there etc.

BUT it's *definitely* not as good as the 'original' (Caylus itself) and secondly, level of emotions is much higher in Caylus than in CMC.

It supposed to be lighter, simpler (and it *is*) and faster (and it is NOT!) Caylus.  But something very important was lost in the process..  Caylus is just not meant to be simplified..

One more note: CMC is for 2-4 players only (contrary to 2-5 Caylus range).

EDIT: strategy of building a castle is definitely too strong and seriously unbalances the game (again, contrary to Caylus)

I loved how this game simplified Caylus while keeping the basics of the game intact. Indeed I was all prepped to go buy a copy until we got to the end game and suddenly the provost mechanism broke. It seems like at late-mid game there is no longer much incentive to add buildings to the road and so the provost has no where to go. With the extra money available at this stage it becomes pretty easy to keep the last 2-4 buildings from being in play. So basically, those buildings are going to be worth a lost less if they are never used. It seems like there needs to be a mechanism to enhance buildings at the end and keep the road building going.
In a three player game I played the provost again ended up bouncing the end of the street. However this time new buildings were periodically built and the provost would lurch forward to the new end of the street. It definitely played better but still has a problem.

I really like Caylus and I remember I liked Caylus Magna Carta. I say I remember because it’s been more than 4 year since I last played it and I have changed a lot in these years. I also don’t remember all the game nuances. 

I liked the game but it didn’t replaced Caylus for me. I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my current feelings for the game with the BGG recommended rating system.

No where near as good as Caylus. In fact, I think it's a relatively poor 2-player game. I can't quite figure out what other people see in it as a 2-player game. As a 4-player, though, it's great.

After playing again, I have swapped ratings with basic Caylus.

The flow of the two games is similar, but the fact that everyone has the exact same buildings means that there can be a lot of everything on the table at once.

The lack of King's Favours means that players concentrate on building the blue buildings and the castle, which also determines the game length.

I like the multiple action selection, too.

It's a cleaner design and not as complex, but still has the varied strategies that made Caylus a hit with our group... I now actually prefer Magna Carta to it's older sibling.

Light Caylus, great game.  If you don't like Caylus because of all the things you have to remember to play the game effectively they you will like Caylus Magna Carta because this only has the basics of Caylus which is what makes Caylus fun for me and this one just as fun if not a bit more.

Confesso que não conheço o Caylus, apesar de saber que é um jogo grandemente aclamado pela crítica e jogadores. Julgava que esta versão de cartas foose deixar algo a desejar, mas nada disso. Este jogo é muitíssimo bom. É funcional, tem diversidade, tem o compêndio tático e estratégico dum bom título, e é divertido. Adorei. Recomendo vivamente.

Never played Caylus, but this is a great game.  Fairly simple rules (so much that the instructions make it look boring), but complex gameplay decisions.  Just don't expect your wife to like the Provost.Update: After several plays, this feels like it's just too long.  I get kind of lost in the massiveness of the choices, too, but my main complaint is the length.  If it was an hour regularly, it'd be great.  But a 4-player game rarely ends under 90 min, and usually is over 120.

I can see how a shorter version of Caylus would be appealing to many people.  However I have the exact same problem with Caylus Magna Carta as I do with San Juan.  Since I can play the original game in a short period of time (Caylus, usually 1 hour, Puerto Rico, under 45 minutes), why play a version that will take around the same amount of time but offer less meat?

OMG! So much better than its predecessor. This is the game Caylus should've been. Easy to learn, easy to play, no fiddly rules which drag everything down.

Caylus is my favourite game, my only 10, so I had high expectations. I think William did a good job of  simplifying the mechanics and bringing the playtime down. I like the random elements introduced by the cards too. The provost move and worker placements lack tension for me though. It is too easy to pass at the time that you want to preserve an advanced road placement because of the constant one denier price. As well, every building has two beneficiaries if activated (unlike Caylus where only the three stone production buildings do). As a result it rarely makes sense to pay for provost moves so the risk-money resource trade-off (late passing) which is so exciting in Caylus is lacking here, making the provost almost unnecessary. My third concern is that it seems counterproductive to me to build a stone production building. Anyone who places on it gets two cubes compared to the owner's one. Wood production is one to one and by the time your cubes run out you want to be creating residences anyway. A couple of extra cubes over the course of a game and an extra victory point in exchange for an early stone and a less desirable conversion building does not seem like a good trade-off to me. I think you would be better off building any wood building or putting the cubes into the castle.

I acquired CMC having never played Caylus, and have really enjoyed every play.  I especially like how much the pink buildings influence potential strategies.  For some reason my wife isn't a big fan of CMC, and I think it annoys her that the food cubes look purple on the cards when they are actually pink.  Maybe she just needs to play it a little more. ;)

A few plays in, I find the game takes a little longer than I'd like. I far prefer the original Caylus.

Endgame too motivated by how much players desire to finish the game, seems like it goes until the big building is built, then everyone wants to end it and goes for the last remaining castle pieces all in one bunch. 
More appealing to me than Caylus, less micro strategy, and easier to figure out what you're going to do and should try to do. Fun, but the endgame is too driven by how much players are investing in castle pieces.

At this risk of sounding unoriginal, this is not the Card-Game-Version-of-Caylus, but is rather Caylus without a board, and a few other changes. Be warned, all comments are based on the 2-player version. The draw deck of buildings struck me as an annoying limitation on my options. The resource cube economy is so tight it could strangle you, and I found the disappearing victory tokens if no one goes to the castle forced my hand a little too much. If players draw and play the same building cards, the game can get dull quickly.

I was hoping for the San Juan of Caylus, and didn't get it.

Caylus the cardgame is a very good adaptation of the boardgame. The core elements have been kept, but the differences and new mechanisms have turned this in a more streamlined game. Money seemed a bit tighter (although this might have been due to the setup of the neutral buildings).

I don't see any real reason to play this over the full original Caylus.  It's still plays decently and it is physically very compact (if you ditch the box) so it makes a nice travel game.  Other than that, it's really just a stipped down slightly more random version of Caylus with a bit less interaction (private hands of random cards vs shared pool of tile).  Sadly, this loss in richness doesn't really translate to shorter play, so to me this is strictly inferior to Caylus.

Although people seem to object to the description "Caylus light" when discussing this game, I do think of this game as a lighter variant of the board game. CMC however is highly enjoyable but doesn't have the same amount of avenues to success as the boardgame has.

The focus of CMC lies on building the castle and/or the prestige buildings. The length of the game (half the time of Caylus the boardgame) varies. When most players focus on building the castle, the game is over in about 45 minutes. When people try and go for the prestige buildings, the game lasts longer. 

I do miss some of the elements from the boardgame, but this is still a great game on its own. Players that have played this game, do tend to understand the boardgame much faster, so its a great way to teach new gamers how to play Caylus.

I haven't played Caylus, so I will instead compare to Pillars of the Earth. Both are resource management games, but Pillars feels very programmed whereas CMC does not. I like the added flexibility (compared to Pillars) and the Ystari trait of multiple ways to score. 

The only downside I can think of is that it takes a bit of time to explain the game. The rules are not complex, but everything must be explained before beginning because of the various ways to score and card interactions.

I don't know why, but I don't like this game as much as I wanted to like it. I've never played Caylus. But I was aware of all the hype surrounding Caylus and CMC. It is a very well designed game. Multiple path top victory. Nice replayability with the deck of cards for each player. But at it heart, it is the embodiement of a dry German game. The theme is absent. And there is no real excitation or fun in the game. You have to pay attention to your opponent and to verything happening on board. Resource calculation and money management is very important. But it lacks the spark that could have made it great.

Update: raise my rating to 8. This is really an interesting game with a lot of replayability/variability because of the starting hand and buildings. A good game lacking some flair but still a good game.

The card game version of Caylus.  You gather resources and money and build other buildings on the road.  You can send batches of resources to get gold which functions as a wild resource.  The game has similarities to Caylus but always has a different feel to it when you play depending on player count and pick buildings that come out at the beginning of the game.  It is not quite family weight but kids who have played other Euros should be able to pick it up.  I like this game and it is a solid Euro.

RATING: 8
This game has little luck (there is a card draw, and different start cards, but there are not many cards).

This is a board game, disguised as a card game.  It does not feel like a card game when you play.  CMC is a worker placement game, VERY "euro", and tight.  I think some might fun the play and theme dry, but would matter more if it had a longer play time.

I really enjoy the provost mechanic that adds the screwage on top of the worker placement blocking. Money is tight, and is used for most actions along with provost movement. This all adds up to create great tension throughout the game. 

The beginner game was dry doesn't compare to the full game. Only play the beginner game once if at all. 

I really like this game. I wish it were a bit shorter so we could play it at lunch. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
One play: A bit dry to be honest. Will play again now that I have a basic understanding of what value different building hold at what part of the game.

Second play: I am not liking this game very much. The mechanics are okay but it's too long for what it is really. I wanted to like this... will give it one more play before I put it up for trade.

UPDATE: traded.

The following comments suggest that this is worth playing before Caylus:
"Caylus Magna Carta is a streamlined, faster, simpler version of said game, that while retaining most of its main mechanics, is faster, easier to learn, less expensive, more fun, and in general, better suited for newcomers to the genre. So the first conclusion of this review is: if you are a newcomer, you don't want Caylus, but you still might want Caylus Magna Carta"
"Caylus Magna Carta is VERY similar to Caylus, but plays in about 1/2 the time. "
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
I really like Caylus, and am hoping this can provide similar experience in less time. First play with 4 players went slightly longer than a Caylus game (eek). Slightly less strategic and fewer choices, so if this doesn't speed up, I'm not seeing a reason (yet) to prefer it.

RATING: 7.6
Good adaptation of the boardgame.  I prefer the full experience of the boardgame, but this does when you have less time or more casual gamers.

RATING: 7
Many reviews have called this less of a card game adaptation, and more of a Caylus lite, and I agree. However, there are times when the low-fat version of Caylus is preferable, so this game isn't completely redundant - however, if length is not an issue, regular Caylus is a better game.

Watered down Caylus. Being simplified isn't necessarily a merit (considering how this was achieved removing several of the options of the boardgame), but at least it's quicker to introduce to new players. It also added some randomness (card drawing).
I prefer the original, but this is a nice little game on its own (it's still based on Caylus, after all).

A quick worker placement game with a healthy dose of randomness.  Usually I don't care about art but this art is bad enough that it loses a point on my rating.

It should be much shorter than Caylus, but it only shaves about a half hour off the playing time.  For that, you give up a lot of options and add randomness.  I would be willing to sacrifice even more mechanics to get it under an hour.

RATING: 5
As a Caylus fan, I was looking forward to a lighter faster Caylus-like game.  This game fails for me.  It feels half-finished, like a play-test version.  There are wonky mechanics (placing cubes on cards so they can only be used a limited number of times, for example).  Part of the appeal of Caylus is how clean the design is.  Contrast this with Ra and Ra the Dice Game--both clean games with the same scoring system and theme.

RATING: 6.8
Just played a 2-player game. Reading the other comments and reviews it's indeed hard to get a prestige building on the table, especially when no castle parts are built. Looking back: it's really strategy to go for prestige buildings or not. Will you choose to go for them or is your opponent going for them and you just have to end it early...?

The feeling of the game and gameplay is for now (in my opinion) the same as Caylus.

Edit: played it a few times more for the 10x10 challenge. The game doesn't really 'grab' me. I like the fact that you have to 'help' each other and try to make the most out of it, but it just doesn't do it for me.

First of all, terrible artwork and color choices.
Secondly a mediocre worker placement mechanism, not new or innovative. Well it is still an adaption of the original Caylus, so what do I expect? Something more and interesting, I guess.
I assume with competetive players the game may be fun to play, because the underlaying mechanism are solid.
But overall it feels dry.

RATING: 8.5
Great game. When I saw that the King's favors was missing, the first player changing every turn, luck of the draw pile and the provost not removed from the game, I thought to myself that this game would not be as good as the original. Surprisingly, while playing, I didn't miss any of the mechanics of Caylus and the new mechanics like the draw pile, makes the game more fluid and less repetitive from one game to another. The only thing that I don't like is that they didn't replace the provost mechanic as most non gamers REALLY HATES IT, and refuse to play the game just because of it.

Played a couple of times with 2 and 4 players.  I really enjoy it a lot even though it has taken longer to play than I expected (75 min with 2 and 2.5 hours with 4).  I think we can speed it up, but we weren't playing particularly slowly.  I enjoyed it more than my one play of Caylus, but I'm not sure why.  I think I need to play Caylus again to make a fair comparison.  My 10 year old son thinks it's wonderful and compares it to Age of Empires II on the computer with the resource management and castle building.

RATING: 7
Le jeu est composé de cartes, de pions ouvriers, des pions ressources, des pierres de construction (au chateau) et le fameux prévôt. Light quoi. Chaque joueur possède un set de cartes identiques, qu'il va mélanger et poser en pioche, faces cachées devant lui. Il se fera une main de départ de quelques cartes, les premières de sa pioche, et à son tour, pourra, sans se poser sur une case spéciale, construire un des bâtiments qu'il a en main (les cartes donc) en faisant un chemin, payer 1 pour piocher une nouvelle carte bâtiment, changer sa main complète (si la pioche est épuisée, on la refait avec la défausse), poser un ouvrier sur une des cartes bâtiments déjà construits, passer son tour, construire l'un des gros bâtiments communs (oui, il y a des cartes communes posées à part en début de partie, cartes qui demandent de l'Or) Puis on résout, comme de normalement, jusqu'au prévôt qui, forcément, a pu, en commençant par celui qui a passé en premier, bouger en payant.

Works fine as a card game, but I'd see no reason why you'd want to own this if you already have the board game.  Kind of like T&E the card game: they are too similar to make them worth having both.  Personally, I'll keep the board game, but CMC is more portable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My biggest problem with this game is that each player has an identical stack of buildings they can build. Players have no incentive to choose other player's buildings if they can build the same building themselves. CMC's big brother forces more interaction by virtue of having unique buildings. Additionally, the buildings are too similar. There is no way to change turn order. There is little you can do with the provost. Overall, just not as good as Caylus. While I was looking for a quicker version of Caylus to have around, after playing CMC, I'd rather play Caylus and choose a different game for shorter playtimes.

Maybe it's just me, but I don't seem to get this one.  I played the original Caylus once and liked it quite a bit, but we've had a hard time getting it back to the table.  I thought this would be the cure.  I was wrong.

Played with two players, it seems to be over before it really starts.  Since all players have the same "action" buildings, there is not a real incentive to use the other guy's (and give him resources) if you can get yours out.  It might be more fun with 3-4 players, but I can't see it and am unlikely to give it a shot.

Maybe we missed the strategy, but this seemed to be largely a race to get the castle chits.  I tried, but a prestige building never got built- they were worth a lot of VPs, but you could get the VPs faster by grabbing the castle chits.

A very good card game version of Caylus which streamlines the original game down into less than an hour - which from a runtime of around 3 hours is no small task! 
I don't think I would play the original game if this version was available as an alternative.
The whole game feels a little dated though.

I didn't have much expectations from this, but it proved me wrong, keeping all the good aspects from his big brother (Caylus), while making a lighter game, without making the strategies lighter at the same time.

I was worried that, because of the shorter play time, Caylus Magna Carta would take the place of Caylus altogether.  But the fact is that Caylus Magna Carta is actually pretty different from its big brother, and so it shouldn't be taking that much play time from Caylus.  CMC is definitely a streamlined version, and some of the changes they made are definitely cool.  I like that each player has the same set of cards, and I like the way the castle building is the game clock.

However, CMC has a much higher chance of generating a really weird game.  In one of my plays, the generic stone building was not on the board, and the only other stone building was quickly converted to a residence.  The result was that resources were so scarce that a total of six batches was all that was sent to the castle.  In addition, each player had more than enough money, and I was able to draw my entire deck to my hand.  I like CMC as a quicker, lighter version of Caylus, but I definitely prefer Caylus to the card game.

The card game of Caylus where everyone has their own deck of cards.  Play is similar to the original game, but instead of putting down a worker, your other choices include draw a card for a dollar, build a card on your turn, or discard and replace your hand for a dollar. The castle is implemented by having a number of tokens equal to the portion of the part of the castle. The game ends when all the tokens are taken by the players. It's a simpler version of the original and plays faster. There are certain cards that you want in your deck in different phases of the game, and you do have to plan around how to get them. In the end, it's still Caylus, so if you like the original, you will like this one.

Everything you heard is true.  This is Caylus streamlined into a much more enjoyable experience (for me).  There's still competition about delivering the most to the castle.  There's still concerns about massaging the game's tempo to work in your favor.  Everything works and it works well.  I would probably pick it over Caylus any day.

--update--
After three plays it is confirmed - this is a Caylus-killer.  It nails the fun:work ratio sweetspot and hits it with authority.  Could go up.

Played with (at least) one rule wrong 1st game and it was ok. Played it correctly for the second game & it was awesome! As one reviewer wrote: "I'm not sure anything can beat CMC for depth to speed ratio". At first blush, this comment may not be hyperbole as we really,really enjoyed it. Simple rules (once you get them), but deep gameplay.
After 5 plays I rate it 8.5 and it may still go up.

It's Caylus at its core, but it's been perverted by the egalitarian move of giving everyone access to the same building options.

I have not played Caylus yet, but I've read the rules and I own it since quite a lot of time. I found it quite similar, although Jooor says it's "Caylus light", and it makes sense.

We played differently and the game still felt very balanced. The end was a bit strange, we had plenty of resources and it was very difficult to plan anything; I'm not sure the games works very well in the last turns.

Still, I enjoyed it. A very good game that only lasts one hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Has the same Caylus feeling that boardgame had. One of the better boardgame-to-cardgame translations. Cards are designed cleverly as are some additional rules needed for card handling. A very good card game that doesn't feel like you're playing a card game. Almost all important parts of Caylus are there unchanged but I think it is a bit too similar to boardgame and only benefits are a bit simpler rules and a bit less of a playtime. I still prefer boardgame but Magna Carta has a merit by being usually faster to play.

A lighter and much better version of Caylus. In this one players can actually have fun as they try to build the castle and place their buildings on the road. This one better rewards the player who built a particular building and makes the penalties (being slammed by the officers) palatable; unlike the main game, in which the more experienced player will always run roughshod over the less experienced one. This one is a good game.

RATING: 6
IMPORTANT: Rating of 7 is for the "Beginner's" rules, which are more fun than the "Standard" game. I would give the standard game a 5. The provost removes too many resources from the game, and is too nasty. The lawyer makes it almost impossible to build prestige buildings, making the game all about the castle. The Beginner's game has a much better balance of strategies. I always include the church though, and can't figure out why it is left out of the beginner's game in the first place.

What I like:
- Reasonably simple rules but good depth
- Worker Placement + Building buildings
- Plays in 60-75 even with 5p (90 minute learning games)
- Quite portable

What I don't like:
- Can bring on a little AP, especially in the last round
- Other people don't like it as much as I do
- Poor graphic design

I have not played Caylus, and probably won't, because CMC is already at the upper end of my complexity preference spectrum. The mechanics don't warrant a 2.9 weight, but the depth of play might. It's about as complex as Kingsburg (2.6), and easier than Race for the Galaxy (2.9). 

The 5-player expansion is great, and it's nice that the 5p and favors expansions are independent, so you can pick and choose.  

I would like to incorporate the favor cards (to allow people to have secret resources, and add a bit more randomness). But I wouldn't play with the special abilities, since they appear to add pointless complexity and are partly tied to the provost.

I need to try a proposed variant where the provost is used, but can only be moved forward, not back. Not sure the cost/benefit ratio of adding that rule would be worth it, but it would be a lot better than the normal provost rules.

Nice board game disguised as a card game.  For some reason it hits a sweet spot and has steadily risen in play frequency.  The beginner rules are pretty good as a kids' game or teaching game.  It plays equally well at all player counts, and most pleasingly, it makes a nice 2 player game.  After several plays my girlfriend is now OK with the provost, so we play with the standard rules.  

It is fascinating how the initial placement of buildings affects the game: you can have a rich game, with lots of cash and gold moving around, or a poor game, where everyone is nearly broke.  For this reason, Caylus Magna Carta rewards strategic planning.

I don't love worker-placement resource-managment games that much (they tend to be too convoluted for my taste) but I like Caylus Magna Carta.  Its a true economic game in a small box, which is rare.

If the goal was capturing Caylus in a card game, this was right on the money.  However, it feels a little too much like Caylus, but with more randomness and without some of the interesting mechanics.  Plus, it doesn't accomodate as many people.  As a Caylus owner, I didn't feel any reason to own this as well.

Good card game. Inevitable comparison to Caylus, Sr: CMC is shorter, more random, more fun. Several of the more peripheral mechanisms from Caylus have been removed, which leads to a more streamlined game.

A small change that I liked very much: if another pplayer uses one of your buildings, you now receive the bonus when the building is actually used, instead of immediately when the worker is placed. So more people have an interest in the movement of the provost.

A lot of options and strategies to explore. With four players there is quite enough of variation in buildings. I've only played the advanced version and I think the complexity was just ok. Although any first-time players will be confused with the number of options. Still, the game needs a provost!

This still isn't a short game though. It'll take about 1,5-2 hours to complete. Of course that depends on the players, but I'll update this after a shorter game.

The mechanic is brilliant I'd say, but sometimes it feels as if I'm paying too much for the card drawing or changing. Of course there is a reason for that price but it still seems a bit high.

Anyways, I liked the game.

I bought this during the first wave of The Works enthusiasm, after enjoying the original board game. The positives of this purchase is that I've learned that I shouldn't buy games on the basis of a) I like the original b) it's cheap. Negatives- Caylus was never going to win board game model of the year, Caylus Magna Carta will win the award for most vomit inducing card game. The game it self, from my memory is part drafting from your own deck and playing it much like Caylus, without any of the excitement. On it's own terms I'm sure it is a perfectly adequate game. In reality people will only take this as a portal Caylus game and be sad they didn't have room to pack the original game.

Didn't make the cut, because ugly games don't stay in my collection.

Completely broken, at least with two players. Money is needed for everything, but you just get two each turn and hardly can generate more. If you get the wrong cards at the wrong time, there's no fun at all. Caylus, the board game, is an extremely good game, but this one is just a waste of time.

A boardless version of Caylus that can be played with or without the provost. It can be expanded to be very near the original game, but plays very well in base form. I like it without the Provost because that makes money more plentiful and speeds the game up considerably, giving most of the flavor of Caylus but with the feel of a light to midweight engine-builder like Splendor.

RATING: 7.25
With only 2 players the economy is a bit lean, especially with bad cards at the start, cube production is a bit slow. For new players being able to redraw your hand at the start isn't particularly helpful becuase they won't know what cards and good or bad. By the end things pick up, but overall the game seems a bit dry, with scarcity of resources limiting your strategic options each turn. Good with 2 players but probably better with 3-4 players.

Edit: played another 2 player game that went a lot better. 2 players is certainly faster, and there were plenty of strategic decisions to keep me entertained, without overwhelming me. Raised rating to 7.25.

Edit: Played several more times, fun with 4 players. Overall a good medium weight cube farmer.

08/17/2007 Picked up at Game Of The Day for $15 shipped. Fantastic game. Keeps much of the flavor of Caylus, but plays quicker. Nice components. 

Some of the mechanics of Caylus have changed here. For example...

In Caylus, you can place a worker on the builder card to place a new building, and this is resolved at the same time the workers are resolved. In CMC you build at the same time that workers are being placed. This adds a whole new strategy to the game, as you can no longer rely upon new resources to place your building.

Not quite as good with just two as it is with more players.

Two 3-player learning games. Much faster than Caylus but also with much less depth. Seems to have several routes to victory. I'll probably play this many times more often than the parent game.

A simpler and faster play version of Caylus.

The basic game (without the nasty Provost) looks like it should be a very good family game.

The standard game is a very good card game which is faster and simpler to play than the original boardgame of Caylus.

(The Favours expansion from the Ystari Box adds more choices, which I prefer, and makes it closer to the boardgame.  But see the separate BGG entry for my comments on the expansion.)

I have not played the original so I can't make any comparisons.  I really do like this one as it is full of little decisions to best build up your goods and castle parts.

After one game.  It ran longer than the 75 minutes on the box, but that might have been down to the constant interruptions and one seriously slow player.

Everyone enjoyed it (and two of the players bought it at the end of the game), and that was just with the basic introductory rules.  I imagine we'll enjoy the full game even more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The upside:
-Obvious lighter than Caylus, but the cut is more in the playing time, than in the decisions you have to made. It's probably my first choice for something meaty in a short playing time.
-The worker placement shines, and sometimes I find myself more obsess on the rewards I don't want someone to get, that the resources I need.

The downside:
-Sometimes I feel there's lack of incentive in draw extra cards, since I have all the resources I need on the "board", and going for the draw will cost me an action/money, set me back on the race for better buildings and I can end up getting something useless.

While this game is a very good game, it doesn't have any advantages that would make me pick it over the original Caylus under any circumstances I can imagine.  Ok, as long as I don't own Caylus, I'd like to have this one.  But as soon as I get Caylus, this one is off my wish list.

Very similar to the board game - perhaps too similar. I like the tension and cutthroat nature of Caylus and Magna Carta missed it a little. Everything was done by rote and I missed the chance of whacking down a building nobody else would be able to own.

It was fun though, and a good, quick alternative to Caylus. Need to play with four.

RATING: 7
Only played 2P, and found the game to be ok. I enjoy worker placement games and I like the way that this offers the chance to create buildings that other players can (and will) use to your benefit. I think it would be more interesting as a 4P game but I suspect I would always reach for other games with that size group available. The colours of the cards caused me a few problems - important to determine ownership and not clear to me at all.

Traded away (after UKMT April 2014) for Bull Run.

Great game.  Caylus looks like it will be too much for most people I game with, so this scaled down version should be good for them.  Not too complex, easy to teach, and each time playing is different.

Update: With two players, play tends to one dominate strategy.  The rules need to be further adjusted for two players: I suggest scaling down the batch points by one, so that 4/3/2 become 3/2/1.  Then we should see more plays tend toward trying to get buildings into play.

Very successful reduction of Caylus. It manages to keep most the boardgame's mechanics while dispensing with one of the fiddlier aspects, namely royal favors. Castle tokens are removed even if no one buys any, so the game can't drag on. The game ends with the castle tokens are gone. Great adaptation that will see much more play than Caylus (though I still like the original).

Somewhat quicker (but not quick enough to justify playing it instead of Caylus) adds a little more randomness (which doesn't seem to help the game--there was enough chaos in the original game.)

RATING: 4
**Update: Yeah, that's about right.  It's fine, but it really is more like work than I'm interested in.  There were very few *fun* moments.  In fact, in this most recent game, none of the prestige buildings even came out, so a whole branch of the strategy never came into play.  In any case, too dry, dull, and processional (early failure seems catastrophic) to be interesting to me.

**Update: Ultimately, more arithmetic and sensations of work for this to be a game for me.  I can tell it's great for some people and a nice design, but my interest is gone.

Certainly need more than one playing to decide whether this fulfills all of Caylus's promise in a nicer, neater, shorter package.  I hope so.  I look forward to trying and the rating could certainly rise.

--Jun2009-- Pretty nice streamlining of the Caylus system.  If anything - from this grumpy point of view - it plays too similarly to its older sibling for me to want to purchase it as well.  Yet that's not to say the game isn't worthwhile, nor that it is uninteresting to play: neither of those are true.  (Though it is unquestionably true that I have used more than my allotment of negatives.)  The game is good fun; the randomness of the building card pool provides replayability at the cost of some random advantages and disadvantages for the players; and the decisions involved seem not at all trivial.

Half the complexity, half the fun of the big brother.

Completely obsolete if you have (and love) the original.

Also am besten gleich mit den vollen Regeln losspielen, der Vogt und die zusätzlichen Karten sind elementar für die strategischen und taktischen Winkelzüge.

RATING: 7
Can't help but wonder why someone would go to the trouble of reworking a board game to come up with an ever so slightly less complex version, utilising cards in a board game fashion, and encumbered by all the cubes and markers - Caylus MC certainly does not take the San Juan path of elegance in approaching its original.

However, I am glad that they did. The randomness of the shuffled building cards counters a great deal of the dryness of the original, whilst still requiring thought and strategy from the player. 

Acquiring this in the Works £7.99 sale (along with the Ystari expansion box for £2.99) means that I am unlikely to bother hunting down a copy of the board game.

Edit: I am finding this a bit unsatisfactory with just 2 players. If one player goes ahead they tend to stay ahead, and there can be a considerable difference in the luck of the draw on cards. Don't think this would be anything like as much of an issue with even one more player.

I may be saying this because my wife keeps beating me, as she does with Ingenious and Roll Through the Ages.

Players are bussinessmen that try to get profit out of the expansion of a town, which was motivated by the King's decision of building a castle in that place.  They help to build the castle; construct buildings; place workers in some of those buildings to get raw materials, money and services, and manage their resources in order to run their bussiness and to get the most profit, which is evaluated in victory points.

After Puerto Rico - San Juan (not so close), Euphrat & Tigris - Euphrat & Tigris Kartenspiel (much closer), there comes Caylus - Caylus Magna Carta (somewhere in between)

With some nice ideas (personal stacks of cards, gold resources, privileges for the builders, simplified castle construction), manages to keep the essence of Caylus (the provost :p) in spite of the rules shortcuts (no royal favors, no scoring track, one resource type less). Not as rich as his older brother, but quite enjoyable nonetheless. Indeed, I'm afraid I might play the (not so) little one more often then the (not so) big one in the future...

Oh, and I like the artwork on this one much better, too !

I thought this was going to be a light version of this li'l critters mother.  And although it is a little lighter - is far, far, far from a light game.  A boardgame played without the board.

Card, Resource Management, Building, Worker Placement. Finally played this (2p) and enjoyed it. It feels very much like Caylus, but a little simplified and streamlined, playing in about an hour on our learning game. Hopefully that means I'll get this to the table more often, maybe at home with the missus.

Rating after one play. A solid card game version of Caylus. I did miss the favour track though, and I thought that our 3 player game lasted about the same amount of time as a 3 player game of Caylus. My rating may improve once I try it with 4 players.
One further nitpick, I think limiting the player decks to the buildings that exist in regular Caylus was a mistake. Everyone was disappointed with how small the player decks were (for a card game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It is pretty much Caylus, only lighter.  Now some people might like this, personally, I feel that much of the original game's tension is diffused here.  I'm not a fan of the fact that you can't build on neutral buildings, this means that you cannot eliminate some of the choices to help your position early on in the game.  The fact that there are duplicate cards of resource producers means that you are likely going to only chose your own if possible.  The race to get buildings the board isn't as intense.  With the bonus of building most of the castle each turn it seemed that there is just too much gold.  Unlike the original game, this isn't that exciting with two, it feels very systematic.  If I hadn't played and loved Caylus as much as I did, I wouldn't have been jaded to Magna Carta. As is, this game is just so close to the original, that I don't really see the point in getting this version.  To be honest though, I tend to like heavier games over medium weight games, so this certainly is a step down for my taste.

RATING: 6.5
It suffers for greatly for being in a similar niche in terms of complexity and "feel" to Puerto Rico, while at the same time not being Puerto Rico. Still, solid in its own right and with an emphasis on timing that makes it feel unique (and satisfying when you get it right!).

After two plays, I can say that I'm disappointed in this game. I was expecting Caylus lite, but it's nearly as heavy and takes nearly as long (at least that is the case with the people I play with). Aside from portability, I prefer Caylus to this. However, don't get me wrong, it's still a good game.

Bit of a San Juan problem here, its a decent enough game but ultimately falls well short of its big brother. It's also sufficiently clumsy in size as to question its merit at all. It takes about as long as Caylus and covers a similar amount of table space - so why not just play Caylus!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I don't like Caylus, but I really enjoyed this.  I found it to be more approachable, and having a hand of cards gave you something to build towards.  It moved much more quickly and felt light and nimble; Caylus feels ponderous in comparison.  I enjoyed it a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's much lighter and preserves many of the mechanisms and ideas of the original game. It does leave out some things, of course: no favors, limited supply of buildings from which to choose, fewer resource types, fewer buildings. 

I remember REALLY liking this game when I first played it -- it retained the feel of the original but played much more quickly. But every play after that has left me thinking that I may want to go back to the boardgame, after all! Or, maybe just abandon the game altogether? The game plays OK, but for worker/action selection stuff I'd much rather play Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery or Agricola. For a card game, I GREATLY prefer Race for the Galaxy. It's a little disappointing!

It has the same problem as Caylus. Too long (although a bit less) and repetitive actions. We're always doing the same thing over and over again. Anyway, I guess I like it better than Caylus. First because of lenght second because it's lighter. Not that I prefer lighter games but, in this case, some of the stupid mechanics aren't present - eg. provost

Caylus Magna Carta is in a way a card game implementation of the classic worker placement game Caylus. While it has been successful in simplifying the game, it also lost most of it's meat in the process. Caylus Magna Carta Plays farily wuick and is easy to teach, but it does not bring anywhting  especially worthwhile to the table, even for a filler game.

I prefer this to regular Caylus. The ability to build a building/card anytime during your turn, rather than only if you play a worker on the Carpenter or Mason. There are few situations left, where you'll use a resource (or coin) earned on one building later down the road. For me, this is a huge help. Setup is remarkably quicker, which is also a boon, as Caylus can take a while.

This reduces Caylus to its bare essence. I like the reduced play time and complexity. On the other hand, I do like the added options Caylus has to offer. As a result, I don't have a clear preference for either game. So while the two games are very similar, I find them different enough to own and play both.

A couple of 2-player games, standard rules. 3 lessons learned: we initially missed the setup rule about removing 2 PP tokens from each castle section; watch out for the SERIOUS potential of having few cube-generating buildings (especially if the single neutral building produces cash rather than a cube); unlike Caylus, he who passes first cannot move the provost beyond the end of the line of buildings to try and protect a worker near the end of the road.

I actually got Magna Carta first and learned to like it... but then I got Caylus.

I never played Magna Carta since. Caylus is just more of everything: more options, more actions, more tactics, more strategy, more tension, more fun.

So I'll probably end up getting rid of CMC even if it's a good game.

I like that there are different ways to get points, and different strategies to pursue.  It is not too difficult to switch strategy mid-game based on what cards people are building.  I think my least favorite part of the game is the provost;  it very rarely gets moved, and when it does get moved it can be very frustrating.

I wish the 2 and 3 player game didn't suffer so badly from the problem that you are helping your opponent by using their buildings.  Alternatively, the 4 player game goes on quite a bit longer and can be a 2 hour commitment.

Lowered my rating to a 7 if only because I feel like I've been impressed by other games.

Well, this is pretty much exactly as advertised: Caylus lite. Lacks the depth, options, balance and control of Caylus, trading off elements of each for shorter, more streamlined gameplay. This will never replace Caylus in the ranks of what I consider to be great games, but it does retain much of the flow and feel of the board game, making this card-driven version a good option for when players don't have time for a longer game or for introducting new players to the basic mechanics of Caylus. A fine card game on a stand-alone basis, but likely to suffer in comparison with the gem that spawned it. Hopefully, like San Juan slowly did with Puerto Rico, Caylus Magna Carta will emerge from the shadow of Caylus and be judged on its own, outstanding merits.

Plays much differently than Caylus and usually faster. It also is a hand management game, adding another layer of complexity to the game. There is a chance for the game to bog down if the right cards are not drawn. Played twice 2-player and once with 4. If the game always played in less than an hour, it would be great, but there is always the danger of it bogging down to 1.5 to 2 hours.

It definitely is a streamlined version of Caylus and that makes it faster than the boardgame. Big deal! In any case it's not a short game even with just two players. 45 Minutes? You'd wish, 75 minutes as also stated on the box is much more like it. Still we really enjoyed it. The lower complexity and the minor adddition of luck to the game makes it accessible for "the-not-so-serious-but-still-more-serious-than-through-the-desert"-gamers (just talking about the complexity of the games here) or the ones willing to go the next step from there.

One play with three players.  I probably would have really liked this game if Caylus didn't exist.  I just kept missing the rest of the game while I played this.  I tend to fall for the my first experience(i.e. I tend to hate cover songs) so this isn't a surprise.  I wouldn't be against playing it, but the whole game I would be pining for Caylus the boardgame.  It just seems to be lacking depth, and the quicker time does make up for it.  It just left a resounding Meh.

The statements that say the boardgame is obsolete make no sense to me.  Its like saying novels are obsolete because of the invention of cliff notes.

I like this game quite a bit. It is definitely Caylus feeling but takes out the drawn out monotony bit that I dislike about the board game. As good of a transition from board to card game as the Puerto Rico/San Juan trip...very well done.

As brilliant as this game is with multiple players it still shines with 2. Maybe not as fully interesting as with 4 but still the basic game is in tact and plays very well.

I don't really understand the appeal of card game versions of board games.  I guess I'm not the target audience because I don't find games like Caylus, Puerto Rico, or Tigris & Euphrates too long or complicated.  And thus I don't feel the need to own or play the shorter and simpler card game versions.  I gave Caylus Magna Carta a try and it certainly wasn't bad, but I just don't see the point.  It's not that much shorter than Caylus, maybe saves you 15 to 30 minutes.  But in saving that time you're losing the favor track and adding in a fair amount of luck with the card draw.  I just don't see any reason for games like this to exist except to capitalize on the parent game's success.

Not quite Caylus, but uses a lot of the same engrossing mechanisms that Caylus does. The biggest difference in feel between the two (aside from losing the complexity of the original) is that in Magna Carta you can play a building and people can play workers on it on the same turn.

Great card game. It is like Caylus the board game with 1/4 the time to explain the game.
If you get the expansion for 5 players plus the favor, then you have something close to Caylus the boardgame. Still the boardgame is the superior game.

[thing=27364][/thing] is a very good game, just not as good as [thing=18602][/thing], the older brother. They share many of the mechanics, but are different in some points: every player has a hand of cards (buildings) which are the same for everyone. This means that, if you don't want to use a building of someone else, you can hope to take the same card into your hand and build yourself. This takes away much of the tension that is present in [thing=18602][/thing] - you can choose to build something everyone will want and use (to earn you points), but the others will be thinking the same, so who will take it first? Will anyone else want to build the same construction?

Anyway, a solid, good game, that plays faster than [thing=18602][/thing], but not by much, and, if I have the time for [thing=27364][/thing] I usually will have time - and prefer - to simply play [thing=18602][/thing].

RATING: 6
Disappointing. Playing the beginner game I thought the standard game, which introduces the Provost, would add a lot. But it doesn't seem to have much effect, as the Provost is usually near the end of the road. You could irritate someone by moving the Provost backwards, but it costs you money to do that.

This resembles an economy-building game where you want to minimize your bottlenecks. The other players' actions affect your situation but it rarely seems very significant or deliberate.

I can easily believe that this game is inferior to Caylus (due to supposedly reduced depth), but I'm not sure how interested I am in finding out.

...Playing this again a year later I think the 6 rating is right. The game's main problem is that it is purely about short term micromoves. It also struck me as too random, with the individual card deck and cost to draw from it, which might mean the original Caylus would be more promising for me. It seemed like you could get boned and be out of it from the start.

On that note, you aren't really building a personal economic engine, but resources feed into each other enough that it seems like a leader might be able to run ahead of the pack to some extent and be difficult to stop.

Moving the provost around can amount to a game of chicken, where you try to leave the burden of paying for a mutually beneficial provost movement to a subsequent player. I'm not sure I find that compelling.

Meh... I really like Caylus and this game just can't compete as it a) lacks so many of the elements of its parent and b) makes chance [the set of cards available to build] a major factor.*  Perhaps the final nail in the game's coffin is that we broke the game (forced it into a stalemate).

* -- don't get me wrong; I am not opposed to games with a significant randomness, but one of the things I and the people I play with like about Caylus is that once the pink tiles are laid out before the game begins, there isn't any.

I find - and this might just be the way my girlfriend and I play this - Caylus Magna Carta to be a very scratchy, scrappy sort of game. By this I mean that funds tend to run very tight, and harming the other player seems, at least in our games, to be the best way to help yourself.

Nonetheless, I find it fascinating how much of an effect the randomly drawn starting card, and the opening hands of the players, have on the whole structure and rhythm of the game; there have, occasionally, been times when money was abundant - and then the whole game must be approached very differently.

Would be interested in trying it with more players.

I don't really know what to think of this.  I've tried one play with 2 players and the game was ridiculous - due to how the first couple turns played out (lawyer was first building made, residences were soon converted), it was never advantageous to build new buildings, and we had 2 resource production spaces (the two we started with) the entire game!

While I recognize this was a bit of a fluke, it also is not really possible in normal Caylus (because of the bailiff, royal favors, etc.).  This may be a worse game simply because awful positions like that are possible (even though I imagine I'll never let it happen again).  I'll have to try it again to say for sure.

-

A second play went better and more 'normal'.  Still, this seems lacking; options just aren't as interesting as with its big brother, and the game isn't enough shorter to be worth it.

I think I prefer Magna Carta to original-flavor Caylus. It offers the same amount of fun but in half (or two-thirds) the time.

The card-draw adds just enough randomness to keep it fresh and to force you to be nimble in your strategery. And the ability (and need) to buy/swap cards gives you one more thing to budget for.

Two things that may keep this from reaching the top of my ratings are that it's a little fiddly and a new (or poor) player can make for a bit of king-making unpleasantness -- so I may have to limit who I'm willing to play it with.

One three-player game so far. We were all newbies and one had not played even the Caylus before, but the game felt ok, quite fast and it was very even in the end.

This is more streamlined than Caylus, but after one game it is hard to say more. No need to own both, that's sure.

One three-player game more, and the game was now a lot faster and more enjoyable. This time there was not much road and no-one managed to build a single green building. The game was quite different compared to first one.

Two player game was not very enjoyable experience, was it just they way we played or the two-player mode, I don't know.

I never played Caylus. In fact the only other game of this type I've played is Blue Moon City. What I can say is that this game stands on its own merits and is a fun reputation building game. The provost adds a little difficulty to the base game. A little much for a filler game and a little light compared to full games. Regardless it is fun when you can find the time to slip it in.

RATING: 7.5
Cardgame in which the trail expands. Everyone puts their meeples on the cards. Some of those are free for others you need to pay to be able to use them. 

Cards are being added but lookout because it is possible to manipulate. Normally the last card is activated but it possible to move backwards (or forward). In that way you can disactivate a card wich your opponent really wanted that round. 

Not bad but we didn't finish the game because of timeissues. 
Curious to see how it compares to the boardgame.

UPDATE: Probably fired by just about everything... There isn't an occasion when I want to play a dry resource conversion game with ugly bits when I could play, erm, Quarriors. The computer game is prettier and more accessible. 

Not as much fun as Caylus on the iPad, but a good portable game. Feels like you're working out how to convert one load of money into the other. Unlike Carson City, it's not much fun really. Intellectually engaging and clever if you like maths, but not fun.

Caylus Magna Carta isn't drastically shorter than Caylus and takes up almost as much space on the table. It IS more portable and does a good job of streamlining (e.g. no more favor track, no more bailiff, no more purple cubes) while still preserving the basic feel of Caylus. It also introduces an alternative building system, where instead of a shared pool of buildings each player has her own deck of building cards. Ostensibly, the cards work well to introduce a refreshing aspect of randomness/variability to an otherwise somewhat processional game. 

By my second game, however, I already felt myself falling into the same patterns of play as with the board game. While I would consider Magna Carta a successful card game implementation of the board game, it's still more of the same, which I think I've had my fair share of already.

Fantastic value for money: loads of cards, money tokens, wooden worker pieces, prestige tokens, resource  cubes, and beginner and standard rules.

After 1 Play: I was excited to play this, as I love the original Caylus.  I expected the game to feel similar but streamlined, with a little bit of luck, and quite a bit shorter.  Well, it did add a little bit of luck, but the game took nearly as long as Caylus.  My real problem with Caylus MC is it loses the elegance of the original.  Though Caylus is complex, it's complexity arises out of a very simple structure.  First you place workers on building, then you resolve all the workers in order.  CMC ditches this framework, and you are left with what I feel is a mishmash of mechanics that don't play well off each other.

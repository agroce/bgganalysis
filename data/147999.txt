Essen 2013. More Pirates than Traders, what with the looting ships theme, but that title was taken I suppose. A fairly quick filler/finisher card game which I'd happily play again, but it doesn't really stand out from the crowd.

Very accesible, very economical design. Just cards, but a great little game. Very recommended.

A decent push your luck style game with a card buying/tableau building for points thing happening.  Needs more plays to determine if I really enjoy it.  Some fun.

This game does the "light pirate-themed card game" very well.  I'm not a huge fan of this type of game, but I would be willing to play it again if someone wanted to play it.

Press your luck a bit when building the card display and then draft those cards in order to gain money or fame. Quick-playing with a few strategic choices and some gambling because all of your fame doesn't count for anything if you didn't take part in at least one expedition.

Bought this before it became "Port Royal". Great little game. I'm a bit disappointed though that now "Port Royal" gets an expansion while "Händler der Karibik" doesn't. :-/

RATING: 8
Played twice with 4 players. Really nice, light, enjoyable and quick game.  Perfect little filler. Really like how the cards are also the currency as it keeps you from keeping track of what cards might be coming up. Great artwork. Would like to see this become more widely available

Entry note 8. It is an interesting and fun game as long as you like push your luck games. Though it has a strategical component in the way you choose to buy the cards.

Duck, Duck, Bruce with a twist, but not as charming. There are some good design ideas in this game, but it didn't really click with me. But I sense that it might get better with more plays. I probably won't be able to convince my wife to play this again, though.

2 plays: Dass es so stark um die "königliche Expedition" geht, ist etwas unbefriedigend/eigenartig. 
6 plays: Hatten den königliche Expeditonsaufruf zuerst falsch gespielt … ein bissl besser ist es so schon.

but looking forward to play more … freu mich auf weitere Spiele

kaum Interaktion (-), dafür sehr schnell gespielt
und cooles push-your-luck element

RATING: 6
My personal enjoyment deviates from the majority which enjoys Händler der Karibik. There's no objective reason such as player targetting or lack of decisions. It's more a subjective annoyance by the random nature of the card distributions which gave me the impression that this game was shot from the hip without much development. The second play was clearly better than the first one but single games will be inconsistent experiences. I rather play something providing a satisfying game experience more reliably.

RATING: 7
A harmless filler card game with a push your luck element and nice OddVille style usage of cards as money. A multitude of tactical and strategic choices to be made for such a small game. Can run to the end surprisingly quickly.

Very simple little push your luck game with a couple decisions but mainly controlled by the deck and your own greed.  Good to have some varielty in the cards available.  Plays in under a half hour so good for lunchtime at work.

Great push your luck type game with interesting tactical choices through the game - and the theme is great too - who doesn´t want to sail in pirated waters and hunt for treasure!? Plays very well with 2 players also.

RATING: 7
Maybe frustrating, if you are not in a position to get an expedition card - this puts you out of the game. We are thinking about home rules. Now amended with the rules of the follow up game PORT ROYAL. Increased Rating.

Kind of unique game with a big "Can't stop"-feel to it.

Rating after 5 plays (with 2 players): 8. I had a lot of fun and I see a lot of replay potential. I wanted to play it again right away after my first game to try a different strategy! But it's true, it does take a little longer than the advertized 20 minutes, but that's not a bad thing, because I enjoyed every minute. For us, it's usually been around 30-35 minutes at 2 players, I expect it to become even longer with more players, because turns are not simultaneous. 
Edit: raised from 8 to 9 after 15 plays. It's still great and getting better as you discover more strategies and layers. Recently, bluffing: my opponent counted his money, twice, while whistling cheerfully, which made me forsake a whole set of cards (drawing cards until I got duplicate ship colors on purpose) because it had started a great card  I was afraid he would buy it with all the money he _appeared_ to have! Then he revealed wouldn't have been able to afford it, and I had nothing to show for it. What an epic situation...

A pretty good little card game where you're racing to 10 points. The expedition gives a little twist, as does the press-your-luck element of having to fight off ships.

Played Handler der Karibik a couple of times, played Port Royal a couple of times. They're pretty much the same OK game.

I prefer Handler der Karibik for the smaller box size.

Technically different from Port Royal by the requirement to complete an expedition and a few other minor tweaks that I forget now. HdK is a good game and I'm pleased it's getting a wider audience, but Port Royal is the better refined version.

Push-your-luck with a thinly pasted-on pirate theme. Great artwork, as can be expected, but the game looks way better than it actually is.

Annoyingly luck dependant but it's also fun to lauch at other players when they also fail miserably

(Nov 2013 - after 1 4p learning game) - A light, push your luck card game.   Some interesting cards with special powers that affect what other players do - how far they push.   Would play again, don't need to own it.

This easy cardgame was available at Spiel when you made a donation. They said it would be the only opportunity to become an owner of this game. I did a quick reading of the rules, and decided to purchase it. When we played it, it turned out to be a very enjoyable cardgame. Not too hard to understand, and just deep enough for his playing time. I just can hope this one will become available some day for a bigger audience. It would be a shame if it didn’t.

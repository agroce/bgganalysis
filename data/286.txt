Diplomacy with knobs on. At least the knobs are interesting and make the game about more than just negotiation. However, that's still the heart of it 'cos if you don't negotiate, you lose.

Diplomacy on cocaine! Love it, but the game may be a little poorly balanced. I controlled 15 sc's, then came plague and I was down to 3. I takes time to learn to cope with that kind of dramatic dynamism...

As a two player game it is recommended to use the "Dark Lands" expansion since this gives you better options to tune the game for 2 players. Playing with different characters every round of play without knowing who is who gives this game an interesting twist to the usual "building" card games.

Superlative diplomacy game based on the mechanics of the classic boardgame, Diplomacy. Set in Renaissance Italy, players play one of 8 states and struggle for dominance of the central Mediterranean. Added rules for plague, revolts, garrisons, and income add needed color to the theme and lively twists to game play. Best for club play where players can leave the game set up between sessions.

I gave it a 7 because it was a very good and interesting game back in the '80s. In 1991 I would have given it an 8 and today a 5. As for 2017 I would rather play many, many games. Very tense and strategic but also very slow and with a controversial system (as you had to write down your orders) and a real friendship-braker in extreme cases.

RATING: 9
I have had my best boardgame experience with Machiavelli. It can be very interesting, but everyting depends on that  players play for fun and not _only_ to win. A good hint is to allways gang up on the richest player and break the alliance once you feel you don't gain on it (but don't tell that to your allied - attack him instead)! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I loathe Diplomacy (rate it a '2') so it's not surprising I don't like this much either.

Basic game is the same a diplomacy (on a different map), advanced game adds in money and bribes - which helps a bit. But underlying system and game play is diplomacy, if you like that then give this a try - if you don't (like me) there's nothing here to alter your view.

Diplomacy with extremely asymmetric factions and lots of optional historical flavor rules which you never get to. Also a third type of unit, the garrison, which can be in fort inside a territory, supporting the unit in the territory.

My favorite Diplomacy variant.  Adding the concept of fortified cities to the basic Diplomacy system works better than I expected.  

Money is another innovation that works well, and adds a lot of options.  There are few experiences in wargaming that can compare to thwarting an attack by bribing one of your opponent's armies into defecting.

It has just been too hard for me to get a game together over the years.

OK, nothing beats the simplicity and guts of Diplomacy: friend-ender!  This gives an added bit of luck, so that at the end of the night (bar any assasinations) you may still have one or two friends willing to play again.  Play it like diplomacy for the first two games then go advanced... it's worth it.  But be warned this game should only be dragged out of the closet once every 6-8 game nights, otherwize you'll get bored of it. Let's put it this way it's not going on e-bay or the marketplace anytime soon... it's a keeper.

This is, in my opinion, an improved version of Diplomacy.  The addition of a monetary system and actual conflict make the game feel more uncertain.  Diplomacy always seemed to go to the player who could sway the most other players to his side.  Too much of a popularity contest for me, not enough game play.  This, however, combines gameplay and powermongering successfully.

Everyone says that this game is great and high prices are paid in eBay for a copy.

But I got tired of it. 

Metagaming is always present. As the game offers complete freedom to attack your neighbours, people tend to ally with their closest friends and stab the noob players, which is awful. Your strategic choices are of no use if you are picked on. 

The system is too complex for what it is: too many rules, options, phases... game flows very slowly. Diplomacy has less detail but makes essentially the same in a much cleaner way.

Also, this game encourages lying, manipulating others and stabbing your allies in the back. Arguments and anger will arise. If this was a short game, it could be bearable, but with a 7 hour game length, these arguments can escalate with nasty consequences.

Sold. For a good price.

I think this is the best Diplomacy variant.  Its not really much more complicated, but the added rules increase your options and make the game more fluid.  Moreover, the inclusion of plagues and famines ties the theme in nicely with the motif of Fortuna that is so prevalent in Machiavelli's writings.

Yes, it takes a long time. But having a timer handy can help with that.  Alternatively, it is one of the best PBEM games of all time.

RATING: 9
Basically, the map is Italy with parts of the Balkans and Tunis. The map is slightly different from the original, Tyrrhenian Sea is not longer split into East & West and the borders arounf the tip of Sicily have been modified.  A few territories (mostly in the north) have been combined with a neighbor to form a new larger territory. The map itself is a work of art and there are NO MISSSPELLINGS!! ;-)

The pieces are similar to the original version (cardboard counters) except they are not numbered. Orders are now made A/F Start-Finish, as in Diplomacy. The basic rules are almost exactly the same as Diplomacy now except for the addition of Garrisons and sieges. (This includes the fact that the new version does not allow fleets on the coast to convoy.) The optional rules include the ducats, assassination, bribery, plagues/famines, etc.

Overall I recommend it, the map is excellent and the game itself should have a different number of players (6-8 player scenarios look very playable.)

Machiavelli is a political-military strategist in the Renaissance Italy, a book of which written by him "The Prince" has been highly heralded as the beginning of the modern politics.  The game was first published by Battleline Pub. in 1978 and the pictures above are the 4th edition by Avalon Hill in 1995.

The ultimate diplomacy experience. Its too long, take a day to complete. Its not easy, not for everybody. But it one of the most intense game I know. Been know as the game to loose friend, in my group. It give a genuine emotion of paranoia. Great but hard core.

One of the great games in the database that is incredibly low ranked in BGG (369). I played for last time more than 10 years ago during my University period and maybe (just maybe) my records are a bit over-estimated. Anyway, it was extremely fun and definitely one of the best bluffing/negotiation games ever produced. 

I'm sure that a desirable reprint (the game was edited in 1977) would contribute to expand his charm...

Puteo máximo, juego seguramente superado por el paso del tiempo, pero es el único juego en el que he visto a un tío tan puteado que tiró la mesa insultando al resto de jugadores (que provocamos la situación, por supuesto). Si hay cuerda en el grupo, este juego quizás la tense mucho.

Como negativo, pues que nos encontramos ante un juego que dura muchísimo y que tiene fases de diplomacia que parecen más una partida de rol en vivo que un juego de tablero.

It adds some randomness to Diplomacy.  This does liven the game up a bit, but doesn't make for a better game.  Instead of randomly choosing your victim in Diplomacy Machiavelli randomly chooses to victimize some players itself.  The historical set-up is a negative for me.  I'd rather have a different set-up every time instead.

RATING: 9
Own the 1980 Avalon Hill version. More complex than Diplomacy in fairness both these games shoudl rank equally at the top of any game list for strategy/diplomatic games. My personal preference has always been for Machiavelli in the past due to the extra detail and variety, but as I get older the 'cleanness' of Diplomacy with its simpler game is alluring. A fantastic game - if you have Diplomacy you should have Machiavelli and vice versa!

Machiavelli recreates the historical situation of the fast developing and ever shifting balance of power struggle in Renaissance Italy. There are five major powers: The Republics of Florence and Venice, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples and the Papacy (which was a secular power in this era) along with 3 major foreign powers: Valois France, Hapsburg Austria and the Ottoman Turks. All of these states singly of in combination compete for control of the peninsula.

Hard to believe it's so lowly rated by BGG subbers. Shame on you. 

It's a vast improvement on Dip with it's well known fault lines, offering a way through those problems and opening up additional lines of action.

What's up with you? You like stalemate lines? Play Diplomacy; you like a game of Dip that actually finishes, but is brutal, nasty, unprincipled and everything that such a game should be when it incorporates famine, bribery, assassination and more??

Welcome brother/sister: you've just found a spiritual home.

Un Diplomatie avec des options de corruptions et de tentatives d'assassinat (avec les ducats, $). On rajoute les garnisons aux flottes et armées. Le jeu rajoute aussi des variantes de révoltes et de famines. La beauté du jeu vient des scénarios historiques (fin du Moyen-Âge et Renaissance). Mais ça reste un jeu long, très long parfois. Et si la devise de Diplomatie est "Destroying Friendships, since 1959", celle de Machiavelli serait "Corrupting Friends and Assassinating Friendships, since 1977".

Yet another game based on the DIPLOMACY version. This game is based in Rennaisance Italy and can be played from 5-8 players. Avalon Hill probably listened to some of the criticism concerning the older DIPLOMACY and made some nice innovations. First of all there are scenarios which allow you to play with less players present. The gaming mechanism has gained in depth and there are now more strategic options. Money has been added allong with assasins, sieges and specialist troops. There is an element of chance in the form of additional revenue and plagues/revolts. A good game all in all, it kept the beneficial elements of the old DIPLOMACY while eliminating some of the negative parts.

Difficult to play but deep diplomacy and strategies makes this game a must. It's always important to read the rules and play correctly, don't make any mistakes with that or the people could get upset, I suggest to use one player like a master only to control the rules. Long and hard plays required to fully enjoy it.

Es dificil de jugar, pero una diplomacia y estrategia profundas hacen de este juego un imprescndible. Es muy importante leerse muy bien las reglas y no cometer errores con eso o la gente puede acabar disgustandose, sugiero usar a un jugador sólo como master y que controle las reglas. Se requieren partidas duras y muy largas para disfrutarlo plenamente.

The best Diplomacy-variant. Hard to find exactly 8 players face-to-face that know the rules well, though it works with Diplomacy-players as quasi-newbies.

Long and strenuous, but beautiful and rewarding. 
Of course, Machiavelli also shines when played by email. Try www.ludomanic.de (German). I wrote the rules (in German).

My rating is a 9 only because the rule-system requires some small boggy adjustments to cover weird cases that could arise (technical flaws which, however minor, a 10-rated game just shouldn't have).

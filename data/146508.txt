Great game. Very much enjoyed Asylum. It was a little hard to keep track of the TIME units though with the people I played it with. -0.5 because each run gets a little more boring.

RATING: 3
After being initially excited by the prospect of this game, we were left very disappointed by it's lack of replayability and seemingly random nature, with no clear narrative that helped tie any of its parts together.

The box and the pieces and the artwork are all great but unfortunately it wasn't enough to keep us 'in the game'.

RATING: 6.44
I will play gladly play this game if someone brings it to the table and expresses the wish to play. In all other cases, it is not worth investing your time nor money.

It has a few cool mechanics, and emotions rise high when playing, but you are hardly in control of what's going on.

It's OK.. didn't even complete the story in the core box.. just so repetitive. Not nearly as "interesting" as Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective or Mythos Tales, and Tragedy Looper is also much better.. I prefer those titles.

SO awesome, highly recommended. I just can't get the right group together often enough to play through all the scenarios, and when I can we often play RPGs instead. If you have a group or environment where you could play this often, though, you should definitely pick it up.

Very nice idea that pushes the boundaries of what we conventionally think of as a board game. The included case file is quite good. My crew needed 3 run thru's to complete the Asylum adventure. 

Buying new case files does add up financially. I suggest spreading the cost around to the people you normally game with. 

The fan community has been stepping up with fan made scenarios that are print n' play. I expect that by early 2017 there will be a dozen solid adventures available for download.

We experienced a glitch in the game play sequence that we think was down to the game rather than us but either way, what a tremendous experience. I was taken aback by how dark the theme was - just wasn't expecting that. One of the most immersive games I've played in recent years. Looking forward to replaying this with a new group of players, with me very lightly guiding the game rules etc for them. Will be great fun to see how they approach the scenario, now that I know the story.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
After playing the first scenario I must say - I love it! The play took us ~4h, including reading the rules. I disagree with anyone saying that the Asylum scenario is just "trial and error" without actual deducing besides the riddles. Actually, I think that the best part is trying to predict what is and what isn't important for success and avoiding wasting time and dead-ends. But that's enough of spoilers.

We completed the 1st scenario in 2 runs with some time left, so I don't have the experience of going multiple times through the same steps. The 2nd run was actually very exciting as we tried to optimize every move and avoid forgetting about something important.

We'll definitely play more scenarios which may change my rating to 10!

RATING: 8
Although we play with 5 players & only 4 receptacles, it is still a great experience for all of us, everyone got the chance to become the TIME Captain & involve in the action. There's a lot of moving from 1 location to another, collecting items (especially new plan, state tokens) that help, doing either deftness/glibness/combat check like in Arkham Horror. There are not as many puzzles as I would like but the clues are interlinked especially towards the final moment in the game. 5 heads are absolutely better than 1! Highfiving when solving complex & complicated puzzle! Luckily we didn't fall into any mission-compromising trap though we did die, 2 times I think. And yeah, we won after the 3rd run in 3+ hours time! For all 3 runs, I used Madeleine du Tilleul as my permanent receptacle, a girl that needs constant companion all the time. Picking a receptacle that closely resembles you in real life always make the game feels more immersive. And Azidi Ismail picked the cocaine addict hahaha! Asylum is more like a training ground for TS agents, there's not much life-threatening situation (the manticore!) It feels like escape games in boardgame form, and also like watching a 3-hours movie. Would certainly love to try the other expansions!

RATING: 7
Mixed feelings.  Glad I played it and it's definitely a good game, but there were several annoying/frustrating design decisions such as restarting, lots of dice-based combat and an unsatisfying ending.  The mystery and puzzles were fun though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Smart, abstracted mechanics and nice production values give life to the adventure scenario - all the more if you relate impressions (as the rules suggest) instead of just read aloud or show cards.  Fun for a few hours if you allow yourself to be pulled into the story, but unfortunately, the first mission is marred by a few bad decisions in puzzle layout leading to frustrating restarts when running out of 'time units' due to no wrong doings, just poor die rolls. Also, the first mission hides critical elements in a few obtuse locations. While clever in construction, the main puzzle solution is ridiculous as it sadly pulls you out of the story completely. So a mixed bag and in the end, an unsatisfying experience for me. I would play another mission, but am not anxious to do so.

RATING: 8
Played the first scenario and had a blast. I really think, that T.I.M.E Stories provides a solid platform for the most inventive and surprising adventures seen in a boardgame format. The basic ruleset seems to be rather robust while still allowing for a lot of flexibility in writing the story and designing the puzzles. My prediction is that the true potential of this game is yet to be seen, since it really boils down to the skills of the authors of the future stories. Basically the options are infinite.

So, I think it will be unfair to judge the game on a basis of a single story since the next one may be worse or better. As a matter of fact, T.I.M.E Stories is a platform while the game comes in the scenarios. The first scenario included in the base game was purely designed for one time use with no replay value whatsoever. But this does not have to be the case, since future scenarios may well stand the test of multiple plays. It is just a question how cunning the designers become. The only thing I am worried about is the amount of money needed to keep the game fresh. However, I reckon the demand and offer for used copies of the scenarios in the market will reach a nice equilibrium rather quick.

It's hard to call Time Stories a game... it's more of an experience.  There are choices to make, yes, but there's generally only one correct choice and the game is basically a maze - it's purpose is to lead you down false paths until you find the right one.

What shines is the immersion and the story elements.  I look forward to breaking open the next case.

The first time you play it, its exciting but you realize there is not much game in here. The 2nd (because probably you will lose the first time) is not so exciting any more. The third feels like a chore. You just want to finish it and move on. 

And that is all you are getting in this box. 3-4 plays out of which only the 1st is something to talk about.

Of course you can buy expansions, but it seems like the base game has the best story so I don't feel like investing further...

Quite innovative game play.  Essentially a choose-your-own-adventure story in co-op game form.  I'm not a fan of how you really have to "play to lose" 1 or 2 games first before you can "solve" the game.  And I don't like memory elements in games.  Those aside, this was quite an experience: a fun way to spend the evening with friends...even though you only get to play it once.  I love how they made this "expandable."  Almost creates a new sub-genre of games.

Really novel idea and I enjoy this game immensely.  I thought The Asylum was excellent, A Prophesy of Dragons was good, and The Marcy Case was OK, but all were worth playing.  If you are reading this, you know the debate about the cost and the consumable nature of the game ... but that does not detract from the game play and novelty which both are worth it in my opinion.

1st play: We played the full first campaign from start to finish and it was awesome.  The story is engaging, the twists and turns are surprising and the production and art tie everything together.  This is the experience that I was hoping to get from Pandemic Legacy, and it's honestly a lot better.  I don't mind that each story is only playable once, because 4 people were enteretained for 4 hours, making this game a great deal compared to other forms of entertainment.  I'm a little apprehensive because I've heard that other stories aren't as good as the first, and I really want that not to be true.  But this game is a must-play, the experience is unmatched.

After playing through several of the stories I just think this game is done, for me.

I found 'Asylum' to be quite tedious. I loved the art and the theme but it was really not that fun to play after the first 2 times we tried. We decided to give the expansions a go though and I am sure glad we did because they are great. I would honestly suggest that anyone that played 'Asylum' and gave up on the series to give 'The Marcy Case' a chance. Because the series is a storytelling game and each scenario is to be played in sequence, I am not sure what remedy to offer to people who want to get into the series other than to just power thru it and hope you will enjoy the next ones as much as I did.

I got Escape Room: The Game on sale, so TIME Stories is still the worst $/time value in my collection. Still, good while it lasts. I don't factor price into reviews unless it's very far from the mean. Mechs vs Minions has amazing value for the price, this does not. It's largely because of custom art for every card, which is fair, but partly because there are far more tokens than you would ever use in a single game, and it is unlikely you will use the insert to "save" a game partway through a play. Consider a second-hand or sale purchase.

RATING: 7.5
Very enjoyable, but also not much of a game. I would liken it more to something like a mystery dinner/interactive theater sort of deal where you're not quite sure where this is going, and you're part of the crank that moves the story forward. And that's a good and enjoyable thing. By all means, I recommend it. But it feels a bit odd to rank it alongside The Golden Ages or Hive. From a mechanical/game perspective, it's effectively a 5. There's some knobs to push and dials to turn, but almost everything you're doing is just brute force. It's not very interesting, as a game. As an experience, it's quite fun. Though, you can only have that experience once, and then you have to buy a new cartridge.

So basically, take this as a ranking of enjoyability rather than as a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a highly interesting game, but one that won't appeal to everyone. The choose-your-own-adventure aspect creates a very real sense of exploration and excitement, but the puzzle are necessarily somewhat hard and the game overall requires players to be patient and highly observant. In my play everyone was very excited the first two loops, but started to get very frustrated on the third loop. 

The system has AMAZING potential though, for fan-designed modules and modules from space cowboys themselves.

I don't know how this game could be any better beyond being replayable, but that's an intended side effect of where they did everything else so very right. Asylum is a fantastic scenario and I look forward to more. Only problem is the price tag for an experience that's only great once (per story), but the experience wouldn't have been so great without the story being consumed.

I did not like the Asylum scenario much, when I first played it. This was mainly due to our inability to solve the main puzzle. By now I played it again in a single sitting and I realized that we forgot a lot of hints in our first try, since we split it up over several nights. The puzzle is actually very reasonable.

Still I think, that Marcy Case and Under the Mask are better scenarios. My experience with The Dragon Prophecy, was horrible and currently is number two among my most frustrating gaming experiences. The Endurance Expedition falls a bit flat due to the overused theme.

Very immersive game. Its more of a RPG than a boardgame. Great first adventure, "the Asylum" had two great puzzels. It´s the game that Mansions of Madness wanted to be like but never was. 
You can never play the core box mission more than one time, when you solve it you have to move on to the next expansion mission. So I guess this game is a bit more expensive than a normal boardgame.

Can´wait to play the next mission, The Macy case.

Hmm. Quite interesting. Wife and I liked exploring the Asylum quite a bit. I did have a few negatives - the rules are a bit unclear at points. Combining that with the fear of reading spoilers, I didn't want to go to the FAQ to get answers, but we figured it out. I'm not sure I would buy this game - but this is a perfect "borrow" or "rent" from a friend game.

Regarding Asylum... (spoilers, I guess). Don't know how I would have figured out the Pentacle clue, but I'm terrible at that sort of thing. I was quite surprised the first time we found a creature that was clearly not human - I was expecting all the terror and horror to be psychological - not actual. I also wish we had more time to explore and see things. The two dead ends were quite amazing - one clearly going to be a dead end, one caught me by extreme surprise.

Ένα από τα πιο πολυσυζητημένα παιχνίδια της τελευταίας Έσσεν. Άκουγα εγκωμιαστικά σχόλια για το gameplay αλλά και έντονη κριτική για την έλλειψη replayability. Το παιχνίδι μου κίνησε το ενδιαφέρον και έπρεπε να το δοκιμάσω. Άλλωστε μου αρέσει να τσεκάρω τα συνεργατικά παιχνίδια. :p

Το βασικό κουτί περιέχει ένα μόνο σενάριο ενώ τα components και το ταμπλό είναι λιτά και λειτουργικά, σχεδιασμένα έτσι ώστε να μην αποσπούν την προσοχή σου από την καρδιά του παιχνιδιού που είναι οι κάρτες του σεναρίου. Οι παίκτες λοιπόν ταξιδεύουν στο χρόνο με σκοπό να αποτρέψουν διάφορα καταστροφικά γεγονότα. Η ιδέα του time travelling επιτρέπει στους σχεδιαστές να φτιάξουν σενάρια σε διάφορες χρονικές στιγμές τις ιστορίας. :)

Το παιχνίδι ακολουθεί την κλασσική adventurίστικη λογική εξερεύνησης τοποθεσιών. Βρίσκουμε αντικείμενα, συνομιλούμε με διάφορους χαρακτήρες, λύνουμε διάφορους γρίφους και ξεδιαλύνουμε έτσι σιγά σιγά την υπόθεση. Το σενάριο του βασικού παιχνιδιού εξελίσσεται το 1921 σε ένα ψυχιατρικό άσυλο και δημιουργεί μια ενδιαφέρουσα ατμόσφαιρα καθώς συνομιλούμε με διάφορους γιατρούς και ψυχασθενείς. Βοηθάει πολύ και το εξαιρετικό artwork. :)

Από άποψη μηχανισμών το TIME Stories δεν έχει να δείξει κάτι το ιδιαίτερο. Υπάρχουν διάφορα skill checks που θα συναντήσεις και ρίχνεις ζάρια ανάλογα με τα στατιστικά του ήρωα σου. Το παιχνίδι σου δίνει ένα συγκεκριμένο χρονικό περιθώριο για να λύσεις την υπόθεση. Μετά επιστρέφεις υποτίθεται στην βάση και σε ξαναστέλνουν πίσω για να ξαναδοκιμάσεις. Το παιχνίδι κάνει ουσιαστικά reset αλλά πλέον ξέρεις αρκετά πράματα και δεν χάνεις χρόνο κάνοντας ανούσιες κινήσεις. 

Βρήκα επίσης ενδιαφέρον το γεγονός πως όταν πας να μιλήσεις με κάποιον χαρακτήρα δεν διαβάζεις την κάρτα φωναχτά σε όλους αλλά αντιθέτως την αφήνεις πίσω στη θέση της και μετά περιγράφεις στους συμπαίχτες σου το τι έγινε. Όπως ακριβώς δηλαδή θα γινόταν και στην πραγματικότητα. Μπορεί να ακούγεται κλάιν μάιν αλλά πάιζει το ρόλο του. Καμιά φορά κάποιος μπορεί να μην προσέξει μια λεπτομέρεια σε μια  κάρτα οπότε συνιστώ στα επόμενα reset του παιχνιδιού να αλλάζεται το ποιος πάει σε κάθε σημείο ώστε και άλλοι παίκτες να τσεκάρουν τι γίνεται.

Γενικά το παιχνίδι προσφέρει μια πολύ όμορφη εμπειρία και συνιστώ σε όλους τους φαν της κατηγορίας να το δοκιμάσουν. Το story σε κρατά σε εγρήγορση και θέλεις να βρεις τι κρύβεται από πίσω. :ninja: Είναι πολύ απλό από άποψη κανόνων και μπορεί να παιχθεί και από casual παίκτες αρκεί να γνωρίζουν καλά αγγλικά γιατί υπάρχει αρκετό κείμενο. Από την άλλη οι hardcore gamers ας μην περιμένουν πολύπλοκους μηχανισμούς και πληθώρα στρατηγικών αποφάσεων. Το παιχνίδι είναι περισσότερο σαν μια ταινία. 

Το πρόβλημα όμως είναι πως άπαξ και λύσεις το σενάριο μετά δεν έχει και πολύ νόημα να ξαναπαίξεις αφού θα ξέρεις ακριβώς τα βήματα που πρέπει να ακολουθήσεις. Πρέπει να αγοράσεις νέα σενάρια. Το αν αξίζει τελικά τα λεφτά του είναι καθαρά προσωπικό και υποκειμενικό ζήτημα. Πχ για να πάμε σε ένα escape room (που είναι και της μόδας εδώ στη Σαλονίκη :p) 4 άτομα δίνουμε 10 ευρώ έκαστος για μια εμπειρία 1 ώρας. Με τα 40 ευρώ μπορείτε να πάρετε το παιχνίδι που σας προσφέρει μια αντίστοιχη εμπειρία και σας μένει το παιχνίδι. 

Ωραίο story driven παιχνίδι φτιαγμένο έτσι ώστε να μπορεί να υποστηρίξει πλήθος διαφορετικών σεναρίων. Περάσαμε υπέροχα. Περιμένουμε το επόμενο σενάριο. :whistle:

It has been a grueling training regiment at the Academy, but you're finally ready for your first mission as a full-fledged T.I.M.E. agent. You and your team will travel back (or forward) in time to prevent some cataclysmic event. But don't waste a moment. Every second counts! In T.I.M.E. Stories, you will work cooperatively with a team to solve a mystery taking place in a different era.

RATING: 6
An interesting mix between RPG lite and a co-op style of make-your-own-adventure book with players acting as time travellers, inhabiting the bodies of various characters - akin to Avatar.  

Players must work together to explore various locations, occasionally interacting with NPCs and areas to find items that help solve the various puzzles, trying to best utilise their skills and overcoming deficiencies, all within time-track mechanism.  

The artwork is evocative and compelling and the production quality is fantastic (as expected from Space Cowboys) but the constant stopping to read and paraphrase text detracts from the pace of the game.  There are also differences between the rules provided and the latest ones available on-line - pointing toward a lack of robust testing.

With each time run more information is gleaned that progresses the narrative, but each subsequent run devolves into a memory exercise, trying to recall what you did on the previous run to optimise your efforts within the available time.  Unfortunately each scenario is also a once-thru and some of the terminology doesn't quite gel (differences in translation, perhaps).  

One piece of advice - take notes!

An modestly enjoyable gaming experience - but overall, it falls slightly short of being the deeply immersive experience I was hoping for.

Time stories is a definition 10 for me. It is incredibly fun, interesting, innovative, and offers me a gaming experience I cannot get elsewhere. That being said, Asylum was a masterpiece and I really did not much like Marcy Case. This review is more for the system than an individual story though, and I am very excited to watch the system evolve.

1 player? play a point & click on your computer.

2 players, you play 2 roles, meh at best.

Didn't try with 3 or more, I suppose it is where it shines best but not in love with the concept of starting over with more known info until I make a good or even the perfect run.

Not even starting on price and needed extensions to replay it as it is sold as an "experience". I already grew allergic to (most) expansions.

Difficult but a cleverly designed game. The first try was interesting and quite enjoyable, but subsequent tries felt more like a memory test and were somewhat tedious. Replayability is zero. I am glad I played it but unlikely to play again.

RATING: 6
A really nice idea squandered by a few weird mechanics. I love the idea of having those beautiful, thematic panoramic views of rooms behind which there are certain bits of info and things to do. I don't even mind the limited-use scenarios either (Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective is God-tier). However, it's a shame that with all of the past and future to choose from they opted for two of the most overused settings in fiction history: zombies and mental asylums. Aside from these gripes, I'd be happy to play it when the group want to.

I only know the base game. The components and the illustrations are great and I like the concept. The gameplay felt like the old fighting fantasy books. 

The game should mainly focus on a really good and deep story and have to compare with a good book. But in the base game the story don't really engaged me and my teammates. The end was kind of unsatisfying. Hopefully the next stories are better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of the very best games I know! A brilliant concept, very exciting. The TIME flies while you play.
The truly fascinating thing is how the plot develops and how you investigate piece by piece until the complex story unravels. It feels like living an episode of "Dr Who" trying to intervene in one of "Sherlock"'s cases. 
If you love theme based games that tell a story above all, you will not find any  better. It is also a good way of introducing people to the concept of role play because it works in a similar way as far as the activities of the players are concerned. 
If you do not like role play and prefer more regular board games on the eurogame side, you should not buy it.

Though probably not designed to do so, I have a lot of fun playing through the scenarios solo. Played through the first four scenarios solo (Asylum, Marcy, PoD, UtM) and am looking to continue purchasing.

Have re-played Asylum and Marcy with a group (with me giving no foreknowledge) and it was a huge hit with the group, and even for me playing through a second time.

I don't personally really enjoy this game due to the seeming lack of strategy while playing it. I do understand that the idea is to do your first run with imperfect information, and slowly begin to understand what you should or should not do on every subsequent run, but the feeling of running into a brick wall that wastes lots of time without otherwise being unable to guess that that would have happened irked me a lot on my playthroughs.

Beyond that, it depends very heavily on the story-telling aspect and theme that the group is able to bring to the game, which one of my groups tends to not be so good at doing.

That being said, I have agreed to give this game another chance if the chance for it to hit the table, arises: thus, I am rating it slightly higher than I otherwise would (4 to 4.5).

RATING: 8
An interesting game to say the least. The mechanics of it are incredibly simple. The challenge comes from the actual case file that you're dealing with. The included Asylum one has some neat puzzles and story that was fun to play through. The cases so far (the included one and the Marcy Case) have both been too short for my liking; wish they would have been larger in scope and told a more interesting and involved story. Unfortunately the quality of the cases that came after this have been really inconsistent in terms of interesting stories and settings. What has been consistent are the lack of puzzles and really poor translations that shouldn't have made it past a proof reader if they had bothered to hire one. They keep using the same tired old tropes to force their Groundhog Day effect which has become exhausting by the 7th module. The past few modules have completely turned us off the system and we've sold everything we had that was T.I.M.E Stories-related.

Was a fun exploration game with a time-loop portion.  It oozed with theme and created a fun, relatively light cooperative game.

Would probably be a 10 if it didn't involve dice.  We got wiped on the last challenge in one turn all due to bad die-rolls, despite being at full health and having items to help us.  It isn't very fun to go through the entire mission again because of that.

Why is this game ranked so high? Why the praise? It's just a poor man's Fighting Fantasy book....well, I should've said rich man. Gamebooks are really old, and putting the paragraphs on cards doesn't make something revolutionary. You can buy a FF gamebook for $1. You can find better challenges and puzzles there (House of Hell and Creature of Havoc, for instance), and please remember, you have 400 paragraphs in a FF book. T.I.M.E Stories is FOUR times shorter and FIFTY times more expensive. Ridiculous! And to add insult to injury, cards are wasted in the intro and items you find. A joke. Zero replayability, zero innovation. And the first two themes, used in Asylum and Marcy Case, are pathetic and overused. I expected a crime scene, interrogations and a culprit. I expected a good story, not this. The extra point I give this game is for the art.

RATING: 4
So many things wrong with this title that I don't know where to start.

The game promises a lot, and then doesn't deliver.
First game we finished thinking, wow, that can be a blast. Let see the next case, as if they fixed the wrong things can be a real unique game. And then, all went wrong.

No real decisions: Let's say that if the game was a "choose your adventure book", in page 1 would say "Go to page 2". And in page 2 , would say "Go to page 3", and so on. Seems that you do something, but you don't.

No story: If you want to give me a good story. Please, give me enough background, no just small bits that amount to nothing. Go there do that because I say so, is not really a nice plot.

Not enough explanations on rulebook. I know, you wanted to create a system, so let's put things open to fit anything we throw them later. But really? A game with only 2 realy choices (explore (test/move/do nothing)- change location) should be 100% explained.

Too much imprecisions in the cards. Ok, that isn't easy. I guess not enough playtest was on the cases. Some weird ways to do the things, without any explanation.

The system doesn't really works, unless more work is put on the cases. The third run is a mash-up of what you do on first and second ones (but now in the right order, but you are almost not discovering anything). If you by chance need a fourth one, I really pity you. One hour lost repeating things you already now.

If this comment seems resentful, it is. The game seems for moments to find the good ways to present info and deliver an story. And it has some really nice touches. But that's all. Nothing else. And for some moments seems that they didn't playtest some parts.

I have never in my life played a game like this. It's a dash of roleplaying, a ton of story telling and a simply AMAZING puzzle to be solved.

That said it really is an amazing experience and my group considers it as being completely worth while.

Great game ruined by unclear rulebook and awkward round structure. The designers should have done A/B testing to find out what feels the most natural to players.

RATING: 10
An innovative system that gives out what is put in. Get some drinks and good friends and delve into a plot. The mechanics provide obstacles as well as tools to cause disucssion, disagreement, and humor. While the original story is very simple, it is a tutorial at heart. Later scenarios massively push new ideas and styles and the game doesn't struggle under the weight. The game costs quite a bit, but for four friends, it is cheaper than a movie and you watch a different version of the movie two or three times. I have since introduced it to new players and have had fun replaying it and watching them work through it, while I acted as a sort-of DM. Another 12+ hours on those cheap movie tickets. The quality of the game will depend on the scenarios, and there are some very good ones now available.

RATING: 9
What a stunner this is. With beautiful visual aesthetics and intuitive, easy to teach rules, T.I.M.E. stories is more or less an old school adventure video game given cardboard flesh and 2-4 player interaction. The mechanics themselves are fairly basic, with a neat die & token system for challenge resolution, but the fact you the insert of the box can also be used as a convenient SAVE STATE for unfinished missions is nothing short of astounding. The one thing it has going against it is that once you've gone through a Mission it won't offer you any surprise, but you can always play dumb so friends can enjoy it and make your own decisions randomly. Also, unlike Pandemic Legacy, you don't destroy the components, so you could lend it out to friends to enjoy while you await future Mission packs (which are a few dollars too pricey, I'll admit). The storytelling in 'Asylum' is quite good, so I can't wait for future scenarios and a possible meta-narrative to emerge.

The mechanics of this game are solid (and pretty innovative, honestly), but the writing is so off-base that it ruins the experience.

The lore tells you to hurry up and solve the mysteries in as little time as possible, but the point-and-click-adventure nature of the scenarios actively punishes you for not fully exploring every location.

Instead of rewarding players who think logically (this is a mystery game, after all), the game has you laboriously poke into every corner, find all the keys, find all the locks, and then do the "perfect run" that you have pieced together.

I'm confident that this could be a great game, if only the writers of the scenarios asked themselves what it is they are trying to get the players to accomplish.

Also, why does every scenario involve the supernatural?  I thought this was a sci-fi game.

From the description, I thought this was going to be Quantum Leap: The Game.  Instead, it's a humorless version of Day of the Tentacle.

When TIME Stories was first released and getting the buzz, I was very skeptical. I was particularly put off by the lack of replay-ability of each scenario.  Luckily someone else in my group bought it.  I have played the first two modules now and I have to admit this is one of the best gaming experiences I've had bar none.

There are some truly unforgettable moments to be had here, and sacrifice of repeat plays is really worth it.  It's not a trivial cost, but it's one you should be willing to bear in order to play this game. 

It succeeds on all levels.  Real, meaty decisions.  Careful puzzle solving. Engrossing stories.  Really fantastic product.

The core system is very vague but for the first story it worked fine and the additional rules on the cards complemented them to fit the theme well.

The theme, story and artwork are very good.

Asylum:
-The art is very horroristic. :)
-Some nice puzzles.
-I did not like the asylum theme, it was a bit depressing to play. (Dori)
-Combat was a bit off (roll one skull and die instantly and stuff)

It's not really a game. It's a choose your adventure and roll dice type of thing. Which can be a nice change of pace from regular games, but it has a major problem. Repetition. All scenarios have to be played several times, and by the 3rd time you know around 90% of the things you are going to encounter, which in a game that is built on exploration is an incredibly bad thing, so the 'game' descends into rushing through and skipping content, which the game design encourages (what kind of game encourages you to skip parts of it?).

Every game except for my very first (Asylum-played only 1 run of the scenario), ended in frustrations. It's a puzzle and the quicker you can figure it out, the less frustrations you are going to experience. But then, the quicker you solve it, the less play time you get from a scenario, which isn't really cheap. 

Then there's the dice. Every time you move between locations, you have to roll a die to see how much time you are going to lose. The only point of this is to artificially prolong the game and make sure you don't complete it in a single run. Even if you have the whole thing figured out, there's still a very good chance you'll have to go through it a few times if you keep rolling badly. If that's not a sign of bad design, then I don't know what is. 

With each new play, my opinion of TS keeps going down. Shame, the first runs are fun though, but playing a scenario only once, might make TS the most overpriced game on the market.

RATING: 8
Szerintem nagyon különleges játék!

Előnyei: társasba oltott szerepjátékként definiálják a készítők, ez kb. igaz is, nagy pozitívum, hogy egy parti akár 1 óránál hamarabb lepöröghet. Nem szerepjátékoztam, de tudom hogy az egy időigényes valami, ez időspórolósabb. Másik pozitívuma, hogy gyönyörű, és jó ötlet a helyszínek összefüggő képsorozata. Sőt az egész koncepció zseniális, mert nagyon egyértelmű, letisztult. Féltem a szabálymagyarázattól, mert hogy mondom el úgy, hogy a pakliba nem szabad belenézni... Ehhez képest szinte magától értetődő volt az egész, egyedül az akadályok legyőzését kell elmondani, meg még néhány apróságot. Hihetetlenül hangulatos, és ezzel a keretrendszerrel bármilyen világba elutazhatunk az időben, szóval a lehetőségek korlátlanok. A játék mentési lehetősége is tetszik, a doboz külön erre van kialakítva, és végre egy játék amit hivatalosan is csak vízszintesen ajánlanak tárolni:))

Hátrányai: nagyon durván nyelvfüggő, magyarításért kiált! A Sherlock-os játéknál könnyebb, de azért ennek a megfejtése sem evidens szerintem (még csak az alapküldetést próbáltuk). A legnagyobb probléma az újrajátszhatóság. Ha pár hónapon belül újrajátsszuk, akkor simán emlékszünk a csattanóra, bár annyi helyszín van, hogy az apró részletekre nyilván nem fogunk emlékezni. Ha valaki sok kieget megvesz majd, 10-15-öt mondjuk (gondolom lesz annyi), akkor már kavarognak a fejében annyira az egyes küldetések, hogy 3-4 év múlva elkezdheti az elejéről, mert addigra tuti hogy nem emlékszik már semmire, ezt kell mérlegelni, hogy ez az újrajátszhatósági szint kinek felel meg. És végül a kivitelezésről: nagyon szépek a komponensek, de az insert szinte mindenkinek megnyomódik, ahogy hallom. A cég mentségére szolgál, hogy amikor reklamáltam, 1 héten belül itt volt az új insert, igaz az is szinte ugyanott meg volt törve, de végül is ez legyen a legnagyobb baj...

Összességében nagyon megérdemli a top100-at, nagyon eredeti játék, mondom nagy kérdés, hogy az egyszer játszhatóságot mennyire tolerálja valaki. A kooperatívak és a rejtélyek kedvelőinek kötelező!!!!! Viszont csak úgy ajánlott, ha minden játékos beszél valamennyire angolul, különben butítva, nyílt lapokkal kell játszani, amit a szabály nem javasol.
---
A második küldetés után felmerült bennünk, hogy az alapkoncepció jobb lenne, ha egyetlen (de akár jópár órás) lefuttatás lenne csak, mert akkor nem kellene ugyanazokért a tárgyakért újra és újra elmenni, és nem memojáték lenne csak helyenként az egész. Bosszantó tud lenni, bár azt is megértem, hogy nem akartak olyan játékot kiadni, amiben hivatalosan is csak 1 parti van:)

This isn't even a game.  It's a loose narrative passing itself as a story that has a lot of false starts and one irritating puzzle that feels so out of place from the rest of the game as to make it broken.  I played until we won, and was unsatisfied even when we did so.

The rulebook is terrible, which wouldn't be such a big problem if there were a way that you could ask questions without spoiling the game for people (or getting an answer without spoiling it for you).  Definitely broken.

I seriously don't understand why this is so highly rated.  There is literally only one puzzle to solve, and everything else is basically the same as a roll-and-move because until you've been through it once, there's not much decision making for where you go -- it's just random, with more places to waste time than are relevant to your missions.

We played it and finished it theoretically in 3 runs, although our score was super bad, because we fell for all possible traps. Some people like it about the game, that there are red herrings, false leads etc. that make you lose time. But we found that a bit frustrating, we couldn't identify anything that would point us in the right direction, so spending a lot of time only to realize that it was wasteful is not a fun experience. We only solved the main riddle after knowing that there's nothing more to find/explore. Then add the end we also failed, simply because we chose the wrong card, how could we know? That kind of let me down, what I liked was the main riddle, and another one with the labyrinth, which by the way should be bypassed when optimizing. I'm not sure if I'm going to invest in further scenarios, I plan to borrow somebody's Marcy Case.

This is of course an out-of-the-ordinary game. It is hard to rate, also.

As a pure boardgame, I feel it's lacking something. Even for a thematic game, it has very few decision points, so it's hard to evaluate and even compare with anything else. Perhaps the closest "thing" is Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, a game I wholeheartedly love, and incidentally a game that's not really a game in the classic way. But this is different.

When I think of it as a role playing game, or something in-between - like a cross over - among boardgame and RPG, it starts to make sense. Perhaps this could be one of the best gamemaster-less RPG systems ever designed. Thinking of it: the console, the cards, the counters... are the usual media of boardgames, but here are RPG components.
As a role playing game, T.I.M.E. Stories delivers a lot.

There is a third way to look at it, even: it is an experiment in meta-design, a trial to press the boundaries of design space. It is obviously very successful if looked at that way.

So, my rating as a boardgame would be a mere six. It is a fragile boardgame, very prone to become a negligible experience with the wrong group. But with the right group, with a group of roleplayers, it is amazing. As an RPG and as a design, I'd give it a nine.
So, 7.5 is my rating.

I almost deducted some score, but instead will mention my points here. The replayability is obviously low without paying for additional scenarios, and is dependent on those being continually published. Additionally, having to replay failed scenarios may become tedious, although not yet.

The game starts out fun but quickly becomes a drag when you repeat the same story for the nth time, missing clues, and forgetting where everything was again. Most boardgames that try to emulate a roleplaying game fail, this one comes pretty close.

WOW!!!!! Fantastic. Brett and I played through the first mission a total of 4 times, finishing in the 4th run. I love this game. The whole package is just amazing. This is the ultimate sandbox of a game and I absolutely cannot wait to see where this goes. I did enjoy the base Asylum scenario better than the Marcy Case (see below) just because I do like puzzles. Can't really say much more than that without spoiler tags.

RATING: 10
While I understand the reasoning behind people's hesitance (and in some cases, refusal) to play this game because of it's one-shot, scenario-based nature, I cannot resist delving into the adventure this game offers. Maybe I can't go back to that Asylum ever again and experience the same ominous, eerie, mystery. But what sticks with me isn't that the experience was temporary, but that it was rich and exciting. Sure, you could complain that the ACTUAL game would really take only a couple hours, that it is only expanded by "cheap" dead ends. But those dead ends are just as fun, thematic, and thrilling as the correct path, and at the end of the day I can't be mad at the game because we CHOSE to explore them. The gameplay is simple, and the story Is not as grandiose as it seems to be. But for a game to deliver what this one does, an experience where I feel I am truly cooperating, where I feel like I am THERE, in that Asylum, solving it's dark secrets- it's a unique, massively impressive idea that warrants not only praise, but the complete disregard (for me) of any complaints about its temporary nature.

I really liked this game, but not as much as my more traditional board games.  It was what I would call "an experience that should not be missed", but I also recognize it is not for everyone.

That being said, my wife, who is not a "boardgamer" traditionally, just sat at the table and played this for 4 hours, and was completely engaged.  Upon finishing the game, she said, "I really liked that, and did not want to stop until we finished...we must get the expansions."

That is why this will remain in my collection until it is no longer supported.

This is really a story with a bit of a game element too.  I've enjoyed it way more than I think I should have, but my rating reflects how much fun I've had with the game.  Having the right group is important with any game and probably even more important with this one.  We completed the Asylum case from the base set and we've got the Marcy case too, so we will be playing more.  Here's a game I never expected to try and now I'm delving into the expansions.  Huh.

-1 it is necessary to finish a scenario in one session (about 3 games), otherwise you will forget most of the things and you will be repeating same mistakes over and over.
1st session (1 game) - game is great 10/10 can't wait to play again
2nd session (1 game, 2 months later) - I have no memory of this, but I feel like I did this mistakes already. 8/10
3rd session (4 months later) - I have already did all of this. What did we forget. I don't want to play this anymore. 6/10

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
More "Choose your own Adventure" than "Legacy", but either way, really neat platform.  It stinks there is no way to replay a scenario, especially for how expensive they are.  Only have played through Asylum, but at this point I think Pandemic: Legacy is the better of the two, but this one was excellent as well.  Looking forward to exploring the rest of the scenarios.

Just played the first scenario. What a divisive game, even for me, internally.

On the one hand, I had a tonne of fun with the first scenario. There were several moments where I literally laughed out loud. I don't expect to win a coop game the first time I play, so playing this again didn't seem like a big turnoff, especially since the rules imply you'd be able to keep some things between runs, so you don't have to start over from the beginning. 

That's true in fact but not in spirit; in effect we may as well have started from the beginning each time. Then on a later run it was remembering the dead-ends and time-wasters. Each run is not short at all.

The rules suggest players not reveal too much to each other -- if I go talk to dude over there, alone, when I return to the group I should probably just summarise and give the gist of what dude said. Great, but we got a clue that could not really be summarised, and didn't even really know it was a clue until later, when we were stumped and didn't have access to that clue anymore because we couldn't take it with us. If a clue is that important, it should have been as a card that we could take with us -- maybe even keep from run to run. Or at least let us know that players [u]will[/u] need to make notes. Then, at least, when we get stumped we can go over all the info we had up to that point, instead of having to backtrack without really knowing what we were looking for.

I guess I'm not a fan of having my time wasted, and this game does that a lot. Combat was a slog, too; the game would have worked better without it.

I guess I really like the idea and what they tried to do. And the implementation is gorgeous. Really the complaint may be about that particular scenario, not the game in general. Actually the scenario is brilliantly conceived, and was so close to being a perfect game experience that its implementation shortcomings just seemed crushing after the fact. Unfortunately, so crushing I think I'll pass on other scenarios.

Didn't like this at first because there's always RPGs to scratch the storytelling itch. Thankfully, it grew on me after several modules because of the way it makes for an event for my gaming group every time a new expansion is released - it's something to look forward to, another adventure Team A will be smack dab in the middle on. 

From then on out, I appreciate how this game brings me and my group together every few months or so. At the end of the day, that's what games are all about.

Can be tricky.  Certainly doesn't work if you don't want to face the same challenges again and again.  But unraveling the story, realizing what you did wrong and then going back in to do it better and faster has a certain charm (especially if your Game Group likes to laugh and make fun of your own mistakes...or that dang face Bob gives you upon failure!).  Some expansions are wonky, or rely too much on VERY difficult dice rolls...but it tends to work out and come down to your team's strategy.

Time Stories is great if played in the right group and with right expectations. It's one of the kind game. It's like watching the movie but interacting and solving a mystery together with your friends. Each scenario is one time only and takes around 3-4 hours. For me it's worth buying.

The Asylum scenario is fine. Good for the first experience with Time Stories but my least favourite. If it would have a separate entry on BGG I would give it 6/10. It builds up really nicely. We were really invested in the theme and plot only to be hugely disappointed in the end. For us the ending didn't add up with the rest of the scenario. And certain aspects of it just destroyed the vibe that we liked.

Not sure what the majority of 3.4k voters are smoking to get an average rating of 8.2 (as of 4/20/16)... this game is not good... in fact, it's terrible... we played for several hours and our win or loss came down to a 50/50 choice and die roll... and then, there's no replay value so you have to go buy a chapter/scenario pack in order to play again.  The whole time it felt like a bad dream that we couldn't escape because we failed and would have to repeat half of the moves/discoveries that we made over the previous hour of play.  This game is a steaming pile of crap and anyone who tells you otherwise probably wants to sell you his copy.

Immensely engaging at the start. Great exploration, amazing illustrations, good game mechanics. I did not love the story telling, felt a bit long.

Still looking to get this played before rehearsals for Oliver resume. Fingers crossed for next weekend.

Still other things in the way, this needs to get played.

Got through one session. I suspect we are being a bit unlucky. I might just start from scratch again before we get too far in.

Just so people don't get the wrong idea - This is a highly innovative game with phenomenal artwork. We both love it.

Played in 2 sessions with Rachel, we both enjoyed it and we will play additional scenarios. I have some issues with the Asylum scenario which I won't mention but they are scenario design issues. The game itself is innovative and solid. The manual however could do with a run past an editor, specifically a native English speaker because their text is very translated French and the meaning is sometimes obscure which is a shame for a relatively straightforward game.

Excellent cooperative mystery solving game. You are a time agent sent back to complete a mission. Movement and actions take "time", run out of time and you are pulled back to the future and try again.

RATING: 7
Note: my single play was of the Marcy expansion. This was one of the toughest games to rate I've played. The ambition and cleverness of this game absolutely demand a ten. The peak moments during the playthroughs demand a ten - very tense and immersive, with moments of real collective emotion for our group. The down moments, though, were frustrating to the point where I got annoyed at the game. As one poster put it, it felt like the game were trolling you in parts. Because of either dice rolls or red herrings, you'd suddenly find out that your session had failed and that you needed to play for another 90 minutes to get where you knew to get before. This wouldn't be a huge problem, but so much of the pull of this game comes from getting excited when you figure a puzzle out; randomness or unreasonable red herrings blocking you reaping the rewards from that achievement blunts the fun of the game. I am told that some other expansions also have more puzzes; sequencing of moves seemed to be more important than anything. All of this said, I actually am considering getting this game to play solo just because the stories are absolutely fantastic and clever that they might be worth it to me. If you buy, you just have to be prepared to take the low lows with the high highs in game enjoyment. I am very glad that this game exists and look to future expansions to refine the equation. Kudos to the crazy ambition of the designers. I would rather play a game ultimately at which I get frustrated than a game with which I become bored.

***update, I have lowered my score to a 6.   Unless you play a scenario all at once, repeating until it is finished, doing it over a few separate plays is much less enjoyable.    On the flip side, you are literally buying something to get rid of it at the end of the day.   Not my cup of tea.

I have never played another like this one. This is the definitive storytelling game at this point in time (no pun intended). I love the infinite expandability and how the console (though stark and lifeless) takes on a life of it's own once the mystery opens. A really solid game!

Don't be turned off by the price and the shelf life. If you took 3 friends to the movies, you would expect to pay more.

Asylum: Really creepy, excellent art, and super tricky puzzles. The red herrings were well done and super frustrating, and the overall story was really, pretty good.

RATING: 4
Well, this was a disappointment. Felt more like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure rather than a game. Didn't seem to be any strategy or real choices to ponder, it was simply what arbitrary result was hiding behind cards. A couple of decent puzzles and one cool one. Even the story didn't do much for me, but I enjoyed it enough with the group of friends I played with. If this was with a group of people I didn't know- and I was there purely for the game experience- it might have scored even lower.

My 2 sons were immersed in this, and demanded a second run after the first which failed. I was ready for a break, but agreed and we pressed on. Very good story telling, and the innovative decksploration seems well thought out, and works very well for a seemless gameplay. Excellent design!

Is this really a game? Or is it more like murder-mystery-type puzzle game? Yes and yes.

Using the Time Units, moving around the board and trying again after you've failed for the first or second time...that's a boardgame.
The rest is solving a case of "whatever this story will lead us to".

It is so immersive that you can dive into the theme and the setting. (We used the Soundtrack from American Horror Story: Asylum while we played
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObPsIckcKQM which almost drove us nuts as well.)

I don't want to spoiler something so my last sentence will be a compliment to the author and the artist from the base game story, very cool story (maybe a little predictable but well written) and well illustrated.

We enjoyed our play of this game and would consider playing an expansion.  I give it a "fun" factor of an 8 rating.

We must pay for our design decisions though, and so TIME stories gets assessed a -2 point "for being cheap asses" penalty......

While I have no problem with a game having "limited" or "one time" content, I do think TIME stories takes it too far.   It should at the very least have shipped with at least one more "story".   If I were designing, I'd probably have included a total of 3.   Yes, still limited, but not stupidly limited.

So, I'm dinging this game a couple of rating points for simply being too lazy and/or cheap to include a scenerio or two more out of box.

For all its detractors, you've got to give this game props for originality. The designers have done something here that is truly unique, by creating a sandbox game that you can plug almost any theme or scenario into and have a totally different experience every single time. The games play much like a single-player survival/exploration video game, making the base game the "console" you play them on.

What surprised me most about the design was how the designers figured out how to allow players to go to spaces multiple times, each time with different information they could gather: this was an element of, for example, Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, that was severely lacking. I've only played the base scenario, so my rating may go up or down based on the quality of releases, but for originality and uniqueness, for the beauty of the art and the cleverness of the design, I am very impressed with this release.

Counted as 3 plays because it took us 3 runs to finish Asylum. 

As a puzzle game, it pales in comparison to apps/computer games with way more puzzles.

Also did not like the dice rolling as it was way too much of the game to me. 

Having said that, I can see how more players would increase the immersion and experience factor and would still want to try out the expansions. Might end up playing all 2p anyway because my gf would prefer that.

First two full run throughs excellent... if not quite as good as our third the week before!

Very impressed with the excellent simplicity and robustness of the game system - it handles everything it needs to very well, without getting in the way of the narrative. Particularly impressed that we could pretty much pick up and play when we came back to the game 6 months later to play one of the expansions - without any need for constant reference to the rulebook, meaning we could concentrate on the story and the few new tweaks to the system.

Success on third run - Score 7: one pink Beacon.

This is one of those games that gamers seem to be giving a pass on its fairly substandard execution just because the idea is so clever and so good. It is a really good idea, but the underlying adventure plays like a bad knock-off of a 70s/80s Infocom adventure - there is just no sense of narrative here, it's just tropes mashed together in a barely coherent way with some really nice art layered on top. Additionally, the game seems to feel like wasting your time with useless and uninteresting dead-ends is a valid thing to do. They need to hire Robin Laws or Ken Hite as a consultant to get some basic understanding of how these storytelling games work. If they had structured this thing like an actual mystery - maybe watched a couple episodes of Quantum Leap or a standard procedural like Law & Order - and not wasted our time with all this junk it would have been much better. FWIW, I have no objection to the puzzles, which were fine. However, I do object to the fact that a key clue is hidden in a basically random piece of art on a card which they don't let you keep and which you have to transcribe. Note-taking is not inherently fun.

Sadly, things do not improve with the Marcy Case - the first follow-on story is, in fact, much worse.

I wouldn't say this is a game to avoid per se. The novelty is worth something if you're a fan of seeing what is possible in games. But it's not worth the time or money they are asking you to invest in it.

Wow, does this game offer a unique experience within the tabletop gaming market! 

Players are time travelers sent back in time to take care of some business in a choose-your-own adventure style structure. Except it's even more than choose-your-own adventure, as you get to decide where you want to go at any time, and what you want to check out once you're there. So, the game doesn't require you to play it linearly, as you have the freedom to experience things however you deem is best.

That being said, the puzzle you're trying to solve does have a single most efficient route in which to achieve success, so your decisions really matter if you want to win before the clock runs out on the mission. Do you trust a character you encounter to give you solid advice? Is this route a trap? Is that dark woods over there a death trap, or does it hold an important clue? It's great fun making these decisions, even when you're wrong!

At the end of the day, I didn't really didn't care so much about "winning" or "losing". It's more about experiencing the story, trying to make good decisions along the way, and this game delivered on that.

I really wanted to like the game.

But as I played it had very little to do with making the right choices. Just random guesses that may screw you over. The dice mechanic for successes and combat was simplistic and frustrating because failing combat just meant wasting more time. And in the 3 missions I played there is literally no way to win this game on the first pass. Which means you'll be running through the same rooms 2 or 3 (or 4 on my first game) times to finally win the scenario.

RATING: 7.8
This game is awesome and a completely new experience in the tabletop realm.  The writing was good, the story had great twists, and the light mechanisms were brilliant.  Artwork is fantastic as well.

There are some problems though which keep this from being a perfect design.  The first is unfortunately a problem with the type of game it is, in that when you repeat going through locations it can be a bit fiddly and annoying to have to reset up a room you've already seen.  Finding the cards and setting them out just to do about 2 minutes of action seems pointless and I wish there was a way to shortcut some of this stuff.

Second, the base game Asylum case only took us 2.5 hours to complete.  It was a glorious 2.5 hours full of joy and laughter and sadness, but still, that's a rough playtime for the cost.

RATING: 5
This is a weird one to rate, because I actually enjoy the experience of playing it (to a point) but it's not a very good game. It's like the world's dullest point-and-click adventure game / interactive fiction but as a board game.

This game as it its best the first time through when you're just running around discovering points of interaction. The surprise of content. Occasionally there are actual puzzles, and that's pretty neat (the base game had like two puzzles and one of them was good). After your first game of it, though, it becomes simply: go to all the places you haven't gone before to see what you're missing. Okay...?

And what do you DO once you're at a location? Roll some dice that have a 50/50 chance of success or failure. Coooooooool.

And finally, once you know what you have to do and where to go? Just remember all of it and execute it again. Sure.

This is all to say that it is a [i]really[/i] dull game, mechanically. Other "thematic games" I don't care for tend to be similarly dice-based, but even those usually have mechanical considerations - you're just at the mercy of the dice. Here it literally is just "try new stuff, see what happens".

Which is kind of actually just fine as a story experience. This is less an interesting story and more a novel, communal way of consuming one. And that "communal" aspect is the key here. I would NEVER solo this game. I would never even buy this game. I would never recommend this game. But if it's a game a friend has and there's a group interested in playing, I will play and even have fun with it as a social experience... I'll probably just get bored well before we've won.

I'm a child of the Eighties; I grew up reading Choose Your Own Adventure books, so I really enjoyed T.I.M.E. Stories. I was a little peeved with one aspect of the Asylum adventure: the gauntlet of monsters that seems like a cruel gotcha, especially when there's a path to avoid it that ends up giving you a fifty-fifty chance of accidentally entering it anyways from the wrong way, leading to an unwinnable game after no real warning. The only thing that has kept me from delving further into the T.I.M.E. Stories universe is the absurdly high cost of the game for what amounts to less than five hours of lifetime gameplay per purchase. If this ever became a (presumably much cheaper) app, it would be an insta-buy for me.

What a great experience. Wow. So much fun. It really came together for us in Asylum. Just finished and still glowing from the game... look forward to thinking more about the first game and playing the others.

After playing through 2 scenarios, I think this game is a great idea with serious execution issues. It is a game that rewards luck and guessing correctly, and although it tries to be a game about deduction (and when it pulls off a well-designed puzzle that requires said deduction, it is BEAUTIFUL) that gets bogged down in RNG issues and too much choose-your-own-adventure b.s.

A fantastic and original story-based game with terrific art and some great turns and twists. Delighted to own it and to have experienced "Asylum." The only thing keeping it from a 10 is that each story has a relatively short lifespan--which leads us to pricey (albeit strong) expansions.

EDIT: It's amazing. I don't care if I can only play it once. I would be delighted to run this for new gamers. The stories (individual and overall arc) are outstanding. Among my favorite board-gaming experiences ever.

The game is a lot of fun...the first time you play it. It loses almost all of its replay value once you complete the main story line.

I really did have a good time with the asylum case, but near the end it was starting to drag on.  The moment that made the night however was when another player and I both solved the big puzzle in different methods at the exact same time after struggling over it for more than half an hour.  That a-ha! moment and then what followed really showed how well a puzzle can be made with a game like this and followed.  I was not as impressed with the marcy case, but that may have been due to some luck we had.

Absolutely incredible gaming experience... For the very first mission asylum.
The expansions just become less and less inspired until it really just becomes pick a card, flip and read it, see what happens roll some dice and repeat until you win.

I the artwork is fantastic as are the components but the one and done expansions plus the nature of the game play have left this one on the shelf now.

TIME Stories is an interesting new entry into the field of story-telling games. I quite like the system (although the rule book could be a bit clearer) and the futuristic time travel theme works well for providing a variety of scenarios.

The base game scenario is enjoyable and the puzzle solving is satisfying. I have completed the scenario once and I certainly feel like I could play it again in the future for the purpose of exploring unexplored options and improving final scoring.

The first scenario "Asylum", it's so funny and at the same time, so difficult. You feel for the entire gameplay, the sensation of what is happening around you and every step bring you closer to the truth. So easy tu learn, but so difficult to master...

OK I hated playing T.I.M.E Stories. I think it's design is very very poor. The designers thought about a game, created it, and decided not to let the players have information that can lead to decisions that in turn lead to solutions. No, they just want you to aimlessly wander around, memorising things, and then repeat until you eventually select where to concentrate your efforts so that you can reach the solution within the time limit. It's just lazy game design.

When Quantum Leap meets The Groundhog Day.

Rating after finishing Asylum (3rd run). 

Very good & clever concept. 

Almost a plug & play game : I really like this kind of system where the rules lies inside of the game components, instead of having tons of process and exceptions to keep in mind.
The theme of the (only) story of the base game is definitively not original but it has anyway worked very well for me. 
The different story paths are sufficient to open many choices after each new clue or encounter. 
The two first runs were obviously failed and we can't wait to launch a new session & crack the case. The third run was the good one. 
Everybody has enjoy the experience at the end. 

Once said, it has to be also noted this game experience is highly dependant of the writing & design qualities of the scenario played. 

I have still some minor concerns: 
- I don't like the artwork of board and components (including the box). Too basic and cold. 
- The story itself (the background) of Asylum scenario is really lacking depth and originality. Considering the themes of the expansions, I'm afraid that this could be true for each scenario. 
- We also realize at the end that the time constraint is a little too heavy to fully enjoy the investigation aspect.

Fantastic Game! I cannot say enough about how great a story game this is. There is a definite cause and effect mechanic that makes you really think about what you do in the game. It makes you careful, or reckless, depending on your play style. I personally like this game enough where I will play it over, even after winning it. Not to mention the expansions. A really solid game that also acts as a game system.

Innowacyjna mechanika gry i 'surowe' wnętrze, jednorazowa i rewelacyjna, a pomimo tej jednorazowości warta wydanych pieniędzy, niesamowita przygoda - tyle wiedziałam o tej grze, gdy zakupiłam z rozpędu cały pakiet na wspieram.to. Wysoka ocena gry w rankingu BGG dawała mi nadzieję, że się nie rozczaruję. Uwielbiam rozpakowywać nowe komponenty gry i je oglądać, tutaj komponenty są raczej neutralne, pudełko ascetyczne, wręcz szpitalnie białe. To karty przedstawiają nam całą historię do odkrycia i z nich wylewa się klimat. Scenariusz Azyl za nami, surowa plansza zamieniła się w fantastyczną przygodę, cudowne ilustracje, drobne szczegóły, smaczki, słowa - to wszystko sprawiło, że przy grze upłynęły nam długie godziny pełne napięcia i emocji podczas rozwiązywania zagadki. Podchodziliśmy do scenariusza ok. 5 razy i każde podejście było ekscytujące. Gra jest fenomenalna i zostaje z nami, czekając na kolejne scenariusze i przygody. Polecam gorąco, to przygoda zupełnie inna niż wszystkie.

I had very high expectations with this one. I wanted it for a long time, the theme, the idea captured me. Once we got it and started to play, I was still very excited with all the cool artwork on the cards, the mystery going on. But as played I got confused and disappointed. Here is why: Once you dive in a thematic world like this, you want to learn more about the story, the people, and at some point want an explanation on what is this all about (!). Artwork is great but the story first captured me and then left me hanging. A little disappointed. I will not get the expansions and not keep the game.

T.I.M.E. Stories itself is a plug-and-play-system for cooperative adventure-games. As such, it does a good job at keeping everyone engaged by prompting players to retell and paraphrase what they read on the cards. The overarching "Time Agency" plot, while a bit underdeveloped, acts as a segue to connect the adventures and enables writers to delve into any theme or trope they wish to explore. 

The included adventure manages to hit an entertaining balance between being aproachable and demanding with quirky, if shallow, characters, some deduction and puzzles and some action. Off to a good start.

Beware: Replayability is an issue. Each adventure is an expensive one-shot. Your mileage may vary.

Some mild spoilers ahead. I liked a lot about time stories and the asylum case. What I will say though is I dislike how short it is. Why have an ability to save the state of a run if a run is only going to take 45 mins or an hour. Also the game essentially maxes out at three runs. I felt like we were just getting the hang of the game by the end of the second run and then there is essentially no challenge in the third run since you have infinite time.

I've had to lower my rating of this game several times. Yes, 8 is still high, because my group loves playing the game. The problem is that the rules are written extremely poorly, and the expansion modules often do not include enough explanation, so you're left wondering about a lot things, having to make assumptions or go searching on forums for hours to find answers to all of the inevitable questions. It's a great story-driven adventure game, but its mechanisms are very inelegant.

I like most of the mechanics. The story's all right. I don't really like the asylum setting--mentally ill people are not a plot device! But I knew that that was the situation with the base game, and I got it hoping that I would like the mechanics enough to try a different setting.  I definitely agree with what most people have said, that this would probably be amazing with the right group of people. I made a couple attempts to get a group together, but no cigar, so I'm soloing. And if that's going to be the case, do I like it enough to try the other scenarios? The answer is: no, I do not. Honestly, I got bored, so I ignored TU and just played as if it was a standard choose-your-own-adventure game, but with cards and dice, which is basically what it is. I would be open to playing it with a group of people, but have no interest in owning it myself or in organizing a group to play it.

RATING: 5
Components: Good iconography. Useful insert (though very flimsy) that has a place for everything. Asylum artwork is fantastic. I'm not a fan of the theme in Marcy Case. Prophecy of Dragons if fairly standard fantasy.

Experience: I enjoy revealing each panorama, then exploring some of its cards. I like that I only see some of them, and for others I must rely on my teammate's summary. I like how the open plan invites us to explore locations in an order of our choosing, and yet the game has mechanisms for ensuring a somewhat linear story.

The mechanism for the passage of time is very clunky: we're never quite sure what (other than switching locations) consumes time. So we are constantly interrupting the flow to say, wait, don't do that yet, because we have to all do our skill/move/nothing decision at once. It seems often one person can end up interacting with several cards, and still not have performed a skill check, and so can still make a move, in the time it takes someone else to perform a single skill check. And does performing the same skill check multiple times continue to consume time? It would be simpler to only track movement time (within a scene, or on the map). I don't think the time track adds anything to the game other than arbitrarily interrupting our experience. I much prefer lose conditions that reflect narrative failures in the context of the story, rather than not meeting the time demands of the time keepers.

There is an element in the Marcy Case that assumes we've played the Asylum. I wasn't aware they were meant to be played a) sequentially, and b) with the same group, neither of which was true for me. Overall, I'm really disliking the central time traveling conceit. It kind of works in the Asylum, because I'm causing my receptacles to do things they wouldn't otherwise do, but in the Marcy Case and Prophecy of Dragons, the receptacle conceit was keeping me at arm's length from my character. Would be more fun to just say I AM this character, and here is my mission, and stop trying to weave some grand sci-fi story across all the scenarios.

After a failed run, I dislike having to play an efficiency game, trying to catch up to where we were before. Feels a lot like one of those old video games where I could only save at the beginning of a level, and if I died I had to redo that level. Really boring and frustrating. The first run is a fun narrative about discovery; on subsequent runs we're ignoring the story, because the game is making us repeat so much, often because of poor die rolls (i.e., we make the exact same choices, hoping for a different outcome). By our third play on the third scenario, we just started ignoring the time tracker and any overly-punitive consequences of choices, because it's so boring to be forced to repeat everything.

Uneven experiences among the scenarios.
Asylum: 8, but unfinished. Not much of a narrative.
Marcy Case: 7; holds together fairly well as a tense narrative.
Prophecy of Dragons: 5. Big problems here. The entire first half just feels like a way to randomize the starting position for the second half. The second half has the coolest randomized panorama of the series, but by then we didn't care anymore. And our goal was too nebulous.

This is not the time-looping, puzzle-solving game I was promised.

Well, there is time looping.  That concept is fun, although the game doesn't do very much with it, since on your third turn your boss gives up on you and tells you to use as much time as you need.  I was hoping we'd be able to alter the timeline in ways that would help us with future runs, but apart from keeping the updated map segments, the game isn't interested in that kind of iteration.  So the looping ends up being little more than a gimmick.

And there is puzzle solving.  As in, solving a single puzzle.  

There's also great artwork and great writing, but in service of what?  A sloppy game filled with dead ends and red herrings.  I wanted cleverness!  I wanted surprises!  I wanted two puzzles, or maybe three!  I wanted a chance to use my character's persuasion skill to find out things, but I think I ended up using it twice the entire game.  Having the combat stat is far more important.

In the end, the game builds up to a climax you don't see coming.  No matter which choice you make, it's over either way.  

So much potential.  Such a disappointment.

l y a des jeux qui buzz. avec une campagne de comm efficace et un design à la "Pomme". T.I.M.E. est de ceux là. Je ne dirai pas grand chose dans ce post, car le risque de "spoil" est tellement énorme que ça casserait le plaisir de jeu. D'autant qu'on ne peut jouer qu'une fois vu que c'est un scénario et qu'il n'y en a qu'un dans la boîte. Après, c'est fini. Donc n'allez pas voir sur Internet  de quoi ça parle ! Jouez, parce que c'est quand même très bien, pas très compliqué. Dans les grandes lignes, c'est du coop, vous êtes des agents temporels qui enquêtent dans le passé. C'est un peu du jeu "dont vous êtes le héros". un OLNI comme on dit dans le jargon (objet Ludique Non Identifié)

A neat concept that struggles in its execution. While the idea of going and repeating stories over and over, as well as choosing new characters, is a great one, in practice it becomes a frustrating exercise in tedium. Some paths cheat you out and the end payoff doesn't feel rewarding. The story punishes you for exploring and it quickly becomes a matter of optimization rather than exploration, which drains the fun in this style of game.

RATING: 5
The first half of my playthrough of TIME Stories was awesome. We were in an asylum trying to figure out a mystery - something was going to cause a temporal rift in this area, and we had to find it and stop it. We explored every room, facing peril and finding mysterious items, tracking down leads, and piecing together the mystery bit by bit.

Things started to break down a bit about halfway through, when we wasted a number of turns on what turned out to be a total waste of our time. (Like, not even a detour that was unnecessary, but an entire quest line that served as nothing but a pointless dead-end to waste our time.) We ended up being a step ahead of the story and figuring out a couple of twists because the hints given were more of the "hit you over the head with it" variety, which made finally uncovering them in game sort of an anti-climax. Indeed, we began to envision a far grander story than was actually there, leading to more disappointment.

By the end, we were openly breaking the temporal rules just to see the game through, and the enjoyment was coming more out of the story we were spinning ourselves than uncovering the truth and saving the world. I distinctly remember realizing that the cards had been written intending for 4 players to be participating, and since we only had three, by all accounts the ritual in question they wanted to use us for must surely fail automatically. It was a little ridiculous, but it very much relieved the tedium.

TIME Stories is so close to being excellent, if it were just a little more streamlined and a little more clever. The artificial difficulty of putting in fake dead-ends is frustrating and unnecessary - when your players end up breaking the rules because they're frustrated, then you know something isn't quite right.

With that said, I have only played one scenario, which is the one that (I believe) comes with the game. It's entirely possible the expansions have improved on the problems I've covered here. Unfortunately, I'm very much not keen to try it again any time soon.

The art and the variety of the scenarios have so far made this work, despite a somewhat clunky game system. Revealing a room for the first time is lots of fun, and the surprises you run across can be a blast. Each of the scenarios has had its own flavor, and despite this we have enjoyed all of them. I will likely continue to buy these until they show a big drop in quality.

Update: the last few scenarios have been a bit bland (the Egypt and Endurance ones). I hope this continues to keep my interest.

I really really want to give this game a 10. When we played the base game for the first (and only) time, my group agrees that it was one of the most fun any of us have had playing any game ever. (For perspective, my girlfriend and I have been playing games for a bout 2 and a half years, and the other two guys in our group have been playing for about 10 years.) Unfortunately we can never replicate this feeling of discovery and adventure that the first play through provided. Not only that, but the following expansions have not been as good. Both "The Marcy Case"(which we felt was a bit to short and with not enough meta-mystery) and "A Prophecy of Dragons"(Which we felt was long enough but very disjopinted and much to chaotic at the end) were not nearly as fun.

If you are looking for one really amazing and epic, six to seven hour session (that's about how long it took us to play the 3 runs of Asylum we had to play before we beat it) then I highly recomend getting this game. Just beware that the expansions, while fine, are not as good as the original.

When we played the original Asylum scenario, one of the players exclaimed 'this is the best game I've ever played!'

All of us loved it, and were saddened that we'd have a long wait ahead of us before the expansions reached a store near us.

It's a clever game that uses information asymmetry and deduction in ways that feel more at home in the style of adventure video games that were released in the 90s. We had to think, consider clues, and truly dive into the plot and the content.

It was a great experience, and it left the expansions much to live up to.

Game started out as a 9, and the Asylum was worth a 9 for the great story & puzzle. Next one was good, but each new expansion has corroded this piece of trash to the point I almost tore the cards up in the latest scenario. (Lumen Fedei) See my comments on each other scenario as a descent into frustration with each new release to understand why it's now a 4.

tldr: Future expansions rushed, badly translated, and rely on luck instead of awesome puzzle solving. (Lumen Fedei puzzle is broken)

Not the best written rules and a game with an expiration date, one you have to invest more money in order to replay. I should hate it. I admit I was initially sceptical, but I am more than glad that I bought it. It's not a spoiler if I say that it hit my best games of all time list

We love this storytelling mechanic, but Asylum is a seriously lacklustre (and objectively inappropriate) setting for the core game, especially considering the developers have all of human history at their disposal.

Great artwork, but the game itself is very disappointing, especially considering all the hype there is about this game.
I do not understand why everybody seems to like this game so much.
Furthermore, the rules are very badly written, many questions are not clear at all, which is a huge problem with a game you can only play once...

The game is amazing. I really enjoyed every second of it.... for the whole 5 hours it took to complete it. The story was intriguing and challenging enough but.. for the same reason.. I can't forgive this game the fact you can only play it once effectively and it's eventually high price for a short experience

Enjoyed the game.  Boy is this hard to teach to a new group.  The instructions are very difficult to go through, and I often find teaching it to a new group to turn what should be a 2ish hour experience into a 4ish hour experience (and I've been told by several people I'm pretty decent at explaining games to people).  Not one I pull out often.

Score of 8.5 based on the first case that comes with the game.  Time Stories as a system gets a score of 10.  So I will not change my rating, but I will say that there are good cases, and there are bad cases.  Anything I say about the cases will just be subjective, and different people will have different thoughts about which cases are better.

I wanted it to feel more like Groundhog Day, where, in each repeat you could do better and better.

It is true that after you finish the scenario there's not much replayability unless you buy/print another deck, but boy, it was so much fun to finish the base game. 5h spent and the game surprised the group a lot of times, introducing mechanisms that nobody expected. It truly remembered my days of tabletop RPG. It got me really excited to implement my own adventures as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Reading some reviews you'd think that T.I.M.E. Stories had reinvented the game genre. But this is more like those Choose your Own Adventure books you used to get where you go to paragraph xx if you do y etc. This is great fun to play amongst friends, especially the early part. By the end it all starts taking on a more mechanical procedure as you have to go over the whole story each time you restart. But nevertheless, given I don't generally enjoy Ameritrash coops I thought this was a very enjoyable way to spend 3 hours, and I might even look at buying one of the expansions. I knock a half star off as it's replay value is close to zero.

So, good fun, but by no means ground breaking.

Travel through time with your team of Time Agents and stop paradoxes triggered by time bandits. You have limited time and your minds will be transferred into a human host picked from the time you will travel to. Every Agent will decide where to explore, and will read the cards that will tell what happens there, before describing the experience to his fellow time agents in his own words. In fact, it is not possible to read the cards out loud. This is one of the coolest parts of the game experience, where a personal narration develops around the table. The theme is generally HORROR.

It's cool but be aware that in 3 or 4 evenings you will likely finish the adventure included, and then, if you want to play more, you have to buy an expansion, since the story will be spoiled by now. Our group had a couple of great nights though (you have to be in 4 players).

The game has a cool panoramic setting device and good storytelling overall. However the reset mechanic where you reset the story and play through it over and over until you get things exactly right through trial and error has been VERY unpopular with all three of my game groups. At best some of our players were neutral or only mildly annoyed by the repetition, while others HATE it and don't like the game because of it. That's why I dinged the game a few points. If this were instead playing through a single stroy once and exploring whereever you like without a hard time limit and resetting the board ala Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective it would have gone over MUCH better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.66
Great puzzle solving game. The real reminiscent of point and click adventures or Escape the Room puzzles. The theme is actually pretty well implemented through mechanics. With replaying the same mystery several times, before getting everything done, running through all the dialogues and cut-scenes because you already know what would happen. Puzzles are clever. Art is beautiful. Story is intriguing (at least for the first scenario). I would recommend sharing this with 3 or more people since that's the only way to justify the cost of the game for mere 5 hours of game play.  

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Clever way of using the scene cards or item cards for various purposes, never knowing what will you get. And puzzles! Oh, the puzzles.

Asylum: really enjoyed playing the scenario except we were disappointed at how quickly we finished it. About 2.5 hours + another 30 minutes to start again (from scratch with no saved items) and check out the (mostly dead-end) paths we didn't follow on our proper run through. So fun, but disappointingly short. If it had been longer (like 4 hours maybe?) this would probably be a 9.

This game is mind candy, and after my first play I could not stop craving it.  I still can't.  Give me more More MORE!  I hope the quality keeps pace with the base game scenario.  This is great stuff!  I really want to say it's my favorite game ever, but I think I have to play the next few first.  

This game is like wandering through scattered fragments of a story and having to piece them all together to make it whole, and the art is what really drives it home and makes it visceral.  I feel like all the aesthetic upgrades board games have gone through in the past few years are finally being worked hard in this game, rather than just being superficial razzle dazzle found in games like Abyss and Elysium(still decent games though).  T.I.M.E. Stories feels like a real level up in board game production.  More please!

RATING: 3
All the boredom of Myst without any of the moral decisions. I wanted to like this, but realizing on the second "run" that all we were really doing was trying to perfect the order of actions and choices, the shine wore off.

What I like here is the immersion. It really tells a story in a compelling way. It is an experience and something that you will remember. What I don't like are some of the mechanics. It just doesn't feel like they are really solid. They feel a bit taped on around the story but don't provide a good framework for the game part of this story. And also, the price is simply too high (including expansions) for the amount of gameplay you get out of this, essentially single-use game.

Just for potential and the direction this game opened up for board games to move on to in the future, I would like to rate it at 9. But just considering this single game itself, for me it's a 7.5. I would guess that this is easily found second hand because of it's single-use nature, so I would buy it used or borrow from someone. I wouldn't buy it new.

2016-08-26 : In essence this is a multi-player version of the old "choose your own adventure" books, with every dial turned up to the max. So yes, it's a puzzle and yes, you're intentionally led down blind alleys, but the whole point of the game is that it's a story you're all exploring and discovering together. Add roleplay elements to spice up to your own taste.

RATING: 8
Played through Asylum and the Marcy Case, both in one sitting but separated by a month.

Really great game system that creates very tense, enjoyable experiences. Game mechanics are really simple and the meat of the game is to solve the mystery, when combined with hidden information (each player describes the locations they visit, don't flip the card over) really helps to keep everyone involved and mitigate some of the alpha gamer problems other coops suffer from.

A couple of critiques which pushes it down from a 10. The rules are a bit unclear in some situations and since the rules change by scenario, it's difficult to prepare ahead of time. There's been a couple of instances that I've had to go to BGG to get clarification during gameplay. I would also like a little more meat to the story. The in game narrative is fine (there's already a lot of information to manage) but would be nice to have a paragraph or two more at the beginning and end of each mission.

This is a tough game to rate as the BGG rating scale wasn't designed for this type of game... I'm comfortable rating this at least an 8, as I'll purchase all new expansions and given an unplayed expansion, I would likely want to play that over any game in my collection. With that said, you really can only play each scenario once, maybe twice if you're will to play with another group, but not actively help to solve the puzzles you already know the answers to.

Great cooperative game. Works perfect with 2 players. Quests are quite difficult!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
T.I.M.E. Stories is kind of like if someone tried to turn a choose-your-own-adventure book into a cooperative board game. You play as time travelers who will go back in time and inhabit the bodies of people of that time to solve a mystery that's causing temporal problems to the space/time continuum. If you fail your objective the first time, you start again from the beginning, but armed with the knowledge of where certain items are located and the outcome of certain scenarios. The artwork and design  of the game is gorgeous. Each scenario has a unique flavour and different artwork.

Sadly, you might not finish the campaign in the first two 'runs' and this can make the 3rd run feel repetitive. Another criticism is that after you have played a scenario, you know the solutions to the riddles and have experienced the story. Unlike completing the Pandemic Legacy campaign, there is no desire to replay any of the scenarios for T.I.M.E. Stories. In addition, there is only a single scenario in the box. Each scenario costs more money. Each scenario probably takes only 4 to 5 hours to complete compared to Pandemic Legacy's 14 - 28 hour. There are many rules questions that can happen in the various scenarios and this is problematic for a game with spoilers. I found Pandemic Legacy to be a much more polished product, though that had one or two questionable things too. The one thing it does have over Pandemic Legacy is the fact that you can sell/trade T.I.M.E. Stories and expansions after you've experienced them.

Overall, it's a very unique experience. If you have a lot of disposable income, you really want a unique experience, you can play a friend's copy for free, or you can convince your friend's to chip in on the purchase of the game, I'd recommend it. Otherwise, I think Pandemic is a better spoiler-filled game.

Please note: I like Asylum scenario included with this game more than The Marcy Case.scenario that I tried.

My one truly voted 1. Just an awful, mindless game. The rulebook is horrendous and incomprehensible. The gameplay is boring, repetitive and quite frankly unnecessary, since you can´t really fail or die, you are just forced to do the same things again and again.

After an hour or so me and my wife gave up on trying to play the game by its rules (which I couldn´t understand even though I really tried) and just flipped and "enjoyed" the story. The story is very basic Lovecraftian, with an asylum and monsters. A real shame, since I thought this game was about time travel and not about dimension travel.

I really really really hate the "Time Unit" concept. I hate all the components and the snow white game board, which maybe emphasizes the time traveller from space thing, but really just distracts you from the story and its atmosphere. I basically hate everything, except the art which is ok.

I´m just happy I didn´t buy into peoples hype and didn´t actually buy it. I was so surprised that it only contained one lousy story, and the "better" stories are DLC!

Really fantastic concept for a game and executed extremely well. I wouldn't recommend it if you have your heart set on winning - it was pretty tough! Replay value is of course basically zero since once you get to the end of one story you'll remember it in the future... but there are so many official and print n play expansions! If you have a group of players who can meet pretty regularly for intense sessions and don't want to commit to something like a DnD campaign then this game is for you.

Played the Asylum scenario in three sessions. This is a very engaging game that leaves you wanting to play again and explore what you didn't see. The game is simple, but the rules presentation is far too long for what it's trying to convey; this makes the game difficult to learn from the rules. Ideally, someone is teaching you. I really want to finish out the Asylum scenario, and see what else the game system has to offer.

I had a lot of fun playing this, because it's a really fresh kind of gameplay, but the mystery in the base box is pretty nonsensical and we thought we weren't allowed to keep notes - if we had, it would have been really easy. Kind of soured on the experience, but I could be talked into trying another.

RATING: 8.5
Really interesting concept of a game system that you plug modules in for different stories. The rules can feel vague at times which sucks because you can break the game by looking at something you aren't supposed to... which you aren't always sure if you are supposed to or not.

What an achievement. They've managed to port a point-and-click puzzle game that is fully cooperative to the table so you can play with friends in an RPG-esque atmosphere. The theme of the game is “Quantum Leap” with the players jumping into the bodies of people from any time and place which means variety is unlimited. Is it perfect? No. But IMHO the good far outweighs it's imperfections as to be a great experience. 

I just love how they're able to render a variety of experiences with just some cards and text. From navigating an underground maze to conducting a DNA test to interacting with all types of characters and monsters – all with some cards and generic tokens. The game transports us and delights us each time with some particularly clever idea.

Mechanically, the game is fragile and susceptible to poor translations or errors on the cards. I've seen plenty of complaints about these things but my group has never had a problem. In the few instances of uncertainty, we've been able to figure out what to do or make a ruling on the spot. I mean, it ain't rocket science and nobody is keeping score.

Certainly a downside is that you play through each adventure only once but that's the nature of mysteries. Perhaps I can let them sit for a few years and come back, but even if I don't, I get my satisfaction via: a) enjoying the game sufficiently enough the first time through and b) lending the game out to friends for them to enjoy as well. 

So far all my friends who've tried it have enjoyed it, so I look forward to seeing what else they come up with. I expect to continue to be surprised and delighted.

Interesting, lots of novel aspects and very strong presentation. But, I wonder to what extent play becomes a somewhat repetitive exploration to find the most efficient path through any given story.

We have lost once so far. I like the story, but the puzzle feel means that I will not want to play again once we win.

We beat it on the third play through with 3 TU remaining. I am not that impressed by the experience. It was fun and I liked the narrative, but there were not many informed decisions to make and I still do not like co-ops very much. The idea could be improved on and changed into something I like better, but as it is, I am not sure how I can leave the game rated as a 7 because I am not really looking forward to the next scenarios.

Super production values on a card based "choose-your-adventure" framework. A co-op with a intricate story that is quite literally a one and done session. More to follow each quarter.

RATING: 7.625
I love, love, love:
- the immersive artwork
- the deduction of optimizing moves and solving puzzles

I dislike:
- roll-and-see-what-happens in a game that's otherwise very much about efficiency
- that most plays end up with disappointment/frustration because of the game's imposed turn limit
- that by the time you've figured out how to win, you're no longer playing and enjoying the game but going through the motions of where to go just to finish the scenario
- that every scenario so far has been so very cliche--zombies, middle Earth fantasy, insane asylum, Cthulhu-ish monster...
- that once a scenario is won, there isn't really much replayability left
- that every scenario is *expensive*, even though it's just a deck of cards in each box

Final verdict: A game like this that is all about efficiency being so dice-heavy just kills it for us. We also aren't as keen on the arbitrary time limit idea or the frequent occurrence of disappointment and frustration with every play. Up for trade.

The first time I played T.I.M.E. Stories, I was willing to play all night to keep trying. It was that fun. Sadly, Darquil punked out due to "being an adult who needs to sleep." Lame. He's redeemed himself though by sending me all his used expansions.  Hurrah!

It's a great cooperative detective/adventure game. You play as time travelers, who occupy the bodies of people from the past, with their strengths and weaknesses, to solve a mystery.  You have a telepathic link with the other players, so you can describe to them things you see (which are described on cards), but not just read the text (because you're supposed to be describing something you're experiencing/seeing in your own words). That gets interesting when you're trying to describe a painting or a picture.  Every action you take costs "time," which is limited. When you reach the end of your time in the past, you're yanked back to the future, finished or not.

So, here's my only gripe about the game. Getting the exact same four (and only four) people together to play has been nigh impossible. We happened to play with someone who isn't often available, and that means it has been MONTHS since our first play (not counting my initial foray into the game with Darquil). Also, my game group varies between five players, and four (but not always the same four).  I strongly suggest that you make sure you have a stable group that's interested in the game before you attempt it.  Also, the first time, start early enough in the day that you have time to play through three or four times in a row.  It's not a good idea to play once, and then wait a few weeks for the next play (you'll forget the clues).

Most of my angst though is because this game is HIGH on my list to play, and it keeps not happening.  If you play it 2 player, or have a steady group of 4 to play, it's totally worth it.  The game board and components are solid, and I love the theme.

This one just did not click with me and my group.  Was a very long game, with too many slow points which made it feel like a drag.  Every time you reset, although you come back with some information, you don't come back with enough - so the first 20-30 minutes are just you and the team slogging through the same couple actions over and over.  The combat method seemed a big clunky as well (to be fair I'm not used to playing games with a lot of dice rolling combat), still didn't help the pace of the game with how much you had to do it, of course it could also be that me and my team played to conservatively trying to keep our characters alive as long as possible rather than pushing how far we could get before dying.  Final thought, not interested in trying any of the other modules/expansions.

I really was not hyped for this one, they said I had to really give it a try. And waha a game, comes equal to mansions of madness, gives the same coop vibe. Basically it is the same game, with less combat and more exploration. I really like it! -1 point for no solo or bad 2 player game.

Something I think would been cool to play. I love video games and when I purchase a game it is mainly for it's story, and from what I heard this board game is very story driven. The only thing that has me on the fence is I hear the replay value isn't that great :/

RATING: 3
Without spoiling anything, I will say that this game gave me too many "Really?!" moments. The best thing about it - the theme - gets destroyed by the "time die" (totally unthemed and frustrating) and by some total bullshit that I won't spoil, but that will leave you open-mouthed. Also, the game is extremely random in the sense that you can't influence the other dice (well, you can't influence the time die as well), and failing too many tests will result in enough wasted Time Units to force you to restart the whole mission. Incidentally, this whole "rewind" mechanic introduces a memory element that I personally abhor. Overall, a wasted opportunity to make a great game.

Very dependent on the Story and group. The game System is NOT an amazing game. However. The story that plays out and puzzles involved are a great deal of fun. It generates stories we tell after the game is over and done even though not all stories are made equal.

This is good fun!
We played two games back to back which is unheard of for our game group. 

Its a cross between a choose-you-own-adventure style game and a roleplay system. its really clever and full of flavour text. You use your time wisely to follow leads and gather clues and you can end up chasing red herrings. Each play through means you have a bit more information, so you can streamline your investigation  i.e. The INSERT ROOM HERE location didnt really gain us anything, lets not go back there.

There still feels like a lot of adventure and exploration to have with this, however you will need to be playing with the same group of people each time you play. There is also a little bit of once you have completed the adventure will it be worth going back to it ever?  Hopefully this will be mitigated by further expansions coming out every couple of months.

Looking forward to getting this played again and again and again!

Dice Towers number one of 2015, and I share the same opinion. We've played this in one run counting a total of 6/7 hours (breaks included) and had no clue of the time passing. It was that much fun! Mechanics are perfect and I'm really aching to play the future released expansions. Why 9 though I see you thinking? The Asylum ending and the plot for me wasn't satisfying enough. Also I still have a lot of questions marks for the most part of the story. If you can share the playtime and the expense with a group of people this is a must play!

Tiene una historia cuidada, una presentación bonita, un buen desarrollo, etc. pero tiene un punto débil muy grande, que es la rejugabilidad. Una vez has jugado un escenario pierde toda la gracia: si juegas con gente que no lo ha probado tienes que pasar a jugar de manera pasiva; si juegas con gente que sí lo ha probado las situaciones ya no sorprenden tanto e intentas recordar cómo resolviste las situaciones en la partida anterior... Además de eso, las opciones en realidad no son muchas una vez el juego está en marcha; da la sensación de que las localizaciones te van guiando de una manera lineal y que las opciones que tienes en relaidad no existen.

The initial premise of the game was very intriguing with the theme of time travel and repeated play through of the same scenario.  I have tried the following scenarios = Asylum, Prophecy of Dragons and Under the Mask.  It was fun at first with the gorgeous art work and uncovering the story as you play the scenario but the tasks are getting a little repetitive and mundane.  Still look forward to the next expansion.

RATING: 7
Basically, Escape the Room, in board game format. The various paths, different reveals, and general story of the base Asylum scenario are pretty good, but it seems like the window in which you can beat the scenario on a single run through is very, very narrow.

As is the problem with these Escape type of games, once you've beaten it once, it doesn't really make sense to play again, so it's a little hard to justify sinking $30 into a one time play through game.

Making it short and without spoilers concerning the story:
(reviewing the German version)

PRO: The very good artwork creates an amazing atmosphere.
PRO: Interesting game mechanics (panorama cards revealing encounters, a medium complex skill test system, time score).

CON: Being a P&P role-player myself, the game remains somewhat undecided between a puzzle adventure and its role-playing theme. Maybe this is because I expected it to be more role-playing-like (which it wasn’t). In fact, the role-playing part can be ignored almost completely, if one wants to.
CON: The main puzzle is rather poorly implemented. To be precise: This is not about the puzzle being to hard, but about its presentation, that left no clue what you are actually looking for. Destroyed immersion for me.
CON: The time travelling theme is a nice one, but finishing the first module I realized that it is a (blatant) story-telling vehicle. That itself is common to science-fiction, but good science-fiction makes its story-telling vehicles seem natural.
CON: Old debate - the price to content ratio. Personally, I find this game a bit pricy and the fact that I need to buy DLCs after only a few hours of playing close to a rip-off.

Rating is for the game system as a whole, each case is probably a 6 for me, with some better/worse than others.

A very clever approach to time travel and uncovering the clues to a mystery.  Resetting just about everything when you go through again.

I enjoyed spending time to interact with just about everything the first time around so that you knew what to avoid your second time, and third time, and the fourth time :).

Similar to other campaign style games this is a 1 and done, although I'm intriqued to go through the other scenarios.  I can see where some folks would be annoyed at spending $60 for a game that they essentially play in about 3 run throughs and then have to spend another $20-$30 for further scenarios.

Playing through the first 3 scenarios has gotten me hooked to play through the rest.

-- The Asylum - pretty good, decent puzzles to solve, horror theme with some literal puzzles to solve
-- Marcy Case - not as good as Asylum, but still enjoyable, more combat oriented
-- Under the Mask - better than Marcy, but worse that Asylum, more linear, but adds the ability to inhabit some of the people in the world.  Only 1 real puzzle, more trying to find out where everything is so you know what to skip.

An escape room experience with some game mechanisms added to it. I like that the game contains puzzles but they aren't apparent at first. The puzzle is trying to create a run through the scenario that requires the least amount of time, and it works quite well.

I'm not too sure about the game mechanisms though. It fits thematically, but after the first run it just feels like busy-work trying to pass the same tests again. Still a very enjoyable experience though.

Also have the Marcy Case. Really liked the base case puzzle. Didn't care for the Marcy case as much. It feels like an exploration game because I want to see all of the locations (I paid for them, I want to go there!), but to "win" the game you need to skip some locations. 

I wish there was a way to explore the game and the locations, then play through while trying to solve the puzzle.

Asylum I would rank at an 8.5 in that the story and setting are excellent, but there were a few moments that felt unfair or unclear. The worst bit is that one of the major clues for the case is in a room that can literally become impossible to revisit. I'm all for having consequences in my games, but it definitely made for a frustrating time.

The few issues that we ran into should all be easily fixed in a second edition.

A bold and innovative proposition that falls flat. The game system is very clever and the Asylum scenario has awesome art and an initially-intriguing setting. But the point-and-click style does not seem to work well for the medium, or maybe the execution needed something more: the game is too short, the ending abrupt and unsatisfying, and the world and characters that are introduced are left begging for more depth. I liked one of the puzzles (the labyrinth), but HATED the big one. For a scenario that is meant to be experienced only once, I think it should be better than what it is. I would instead recommend Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective if you are looking for a thematic mystery-solving experience, or Arkham Horror: The Card Game for a story-rich exploration game with much-tighter mechanics.

What remains of T.I.M.E Stories if you skip the discussion about whether a game that can realistically only be played once is a good idea? There is both an underlying game system (that is expanded on in the supplements) and the teaser story of the asylum.

The game system itself is rather simple and basically comes down to replaying any given scenario until you get it right. This approach quite obviously runs the risk of becoming repetitive, and there is little in the system itself to counter that risk. Therefore, most of the burden of creating a memorable game lasts on the story. Sadly, the asylum plot, while initially interesting as a story, soon devolves into a rather incoherent and unimaginative Lovecraft reference or something of the sort and relies almost entirely on pure trial and error. One lonely puzzle, no deduction, no real challenges for the players. As a game, that is not very compelling. It's rather like a book that you need to restart multiple times in order to get to the end. I'm sure that more interesting plots are possible but they need to fight against and overcome the restrictions of the system rather than stay safely withing its confines. That's not too promising as far as premises go.

Again, the artwork is pure Gold. With whipped cream on top. And a cherry as well! The game is good. I made the mistake to play it after I started playing Pandemic Legacy – which is by far superior.
Really like T.I.M.E Stories and it could have been a 9 or even a 10 easily if the designers just had put in some more riddles like the map riddle.

+++Update+++
After another scenario I have to change my rating from 7 to 5. What I thought to be a not yet ideal design of the story turned out to be the main mechanic of the game. Running from one point to the other hoping to find the right turnout soon enough so that it only takes you 2 or 3 run-throughs … no thanks.

I would love to play the game without the annoying time units that never suffice (on purpose as this is part of the game mechanic). That way I could get into my role and behave like my character would and experience the world.

Played 2 stories and (most likely) won't play a third one.

Biggest disappointment in a long time. Didn't live up to hype. The box and components are beautiful and the idea of time traveling mystery solving is fantastic, HOWEVER...

This is choose your own adventure in boardgame format and can be done cooperatively. The game has solvable challenges and mysteries with the answers more or less available within the gameplay. This makes it very cool, along with a format where you can purchase new stories for the game periodically. However, once you manage to win the game (and make no mistake, it is designed for the first run to be a failure unless you play something wrong or make incredibly lucky choices/dice rolls), you won't want to play that scenario again. So you won't play this game with more than a single group. you may recommend it and loan the game out for them to play, but you can't play with them if you know all the spoilers. That breaks a fundamental piece of boardgaming for me. It's a great experience, but it's a single experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This game has some good ideas, but it's fundamentally broken. To "win", you need to memorize the correct sequence of plays and perform them in exact order. The only way to learn the correct sequence of plays is by dead reckoning. Guess wrong, lose, and start over from the beginning. Ways to lose include: Doing someone a favor, not doing someone a favor, not talking to a person, and my personal favorite: talking to a person. Oh, and of course there are dice. Start over and better luck next time.

I love the concept of a choose your own adventure game (I read these books as a kid and have very fond memories), but this is an awful implementation. This was singularly the most tedious and frustrating experience I've ever had gaming, and I would urge you to stay the hell away from this game.

That said, I have a copy in excellent condition for sale or trade.

Only played the first scenario, so please take this review with a grain of salt. We found the implementation of the time theme had promise but wasn't well integrated. We loved the idea of "perfecting" a run through, but the numerous red herrings and dice rolling led to a feeling that the game was purely luck driven rather than reliant on any particular skill or thought. Perhaps the later expansions are different, but they are priced so highly that we can't really justify them when we didn't really enjoy the base game and can only play this once.

It was okay. I played Asylum. We stopped during the 3rd run. By that point it was getting very repetitive. I also disliked that the game discouraged exploration while at the same time having a very strong RPG feel. The system basically forces you to go as fast as you can and skip over lots of things to race to the finish. Maybe I'l play again.

Oh man, I don't even know how to rate this one. Gameplay, innovation, mind blowing cleverness...it gets a 9 at LEAST for all that. For the first story itself...well it was kind of tasteless and put my wife off. It's no biggie if you watch R-rated movies, as there's nothing you wouldn't expect in even a PG-13 horror movie, but family game this ain't. 

This rating is likely to change when/if I convince my wife to play further scenarios.

When I first looked at this I thought it would really be fun and it probably is. It pays to read reviews though because once you've played though the game the replay ability goes down a long way. So if you don't mind that sort of thing it's probably going to be pretty good, and you can always trade it for another game to someone who hasn't played it yet. I read where there are expansions and other scenarios, so  you'll get some good plays out of it for sure.

A VERY Amerithrash, puzzle solving, co-op story game.  Beautiful art design.  Story suffers a bit from being on a rail and I don't enjoy having to re-do the story from the beginning every time you fail.  Make sure every player is invested in paying attention to the clues and story - no cell phones on this one.  

The story is, for me, a little disjointed.  There are several components to the game itself, the story, the time frame, the setting and they don't seem to gel in any meaningful way.

RATING: 9
I will try to break down comments about the game Time Stories (the system used in all scenarios) and the first scenario Asylum as much as possible.

Pros:
- The game Time Stories has huge potential. It is very similar to any good modern point and click video game, but with an amazing cooperative twist to it.
- Excellent story telling mechanics, such as having to talk about the card you have just read rather than reading it out loud. One of my favourite mechanics ever, if played with the right group of people who like a bit of role playing.
- The story and puzzles of the Asylum scenario are good and just the right level of difficulty. It can be fun, scary, mysterious, action based and reflexion based at times.
- The art of the Time Stories game and of the Asylum scenario are gorgeous.
- In the Asylum scenario, each run felt very different from one another, not feeling like we were playing the same game again and again. I thought there would be more focus on the efficiency aspect where in fact each run got to be a chapter of the story.
- In the Asylum scenario, each 'receptacle' (character) has quite a different flavour with unique strengths and (fun) weaknesses and players can change character for each run, which supports asymmetric cooperation.
- All in all, we lived a great social experience (which had the potential to be epic but was not), with both newbies and gamers. When the game flows nicely, it is thrilling.

Cons:
- The Time Stories game severely lacks a tutorial. It would add tremendous value to warm up as a group using a tutorial scenario of 2 locations for instance, that get us through the mechanics of the game. Because of the inherent nature of the game, I was not able to playtest it and get familiar with the mechanics before with my group. It took us one or two runs to get it to flow nicely (especially the time units mechanics), which hindered the experience of the Asylum scenario somehow. I don't think Asylum is tutorial material. The game strongly encourages the entire group to be familiar with the rules and mechanics before starting the Asylum scenario to be fully immersed from the beginning, but I just don't see how it is possible. So the group got distracted by too many questions about the rules during the first two runs and the discussions were not focused on the investigation, which means we missed some key evidence.
- I would say that in the absence of tutorial, the Time Stories game's time units mechanic, how to solve some puzzles and knowing when to read some sealed or 'end of mission' cards are a bit fiddly.
- The Asylum scenario would benefit from coming with a couple of help cards, just like numerous point and click video games nowadays. The first card would have a very vague and encouraging statement like 'have you had a good look at the cards?' maybe, the second card would tell you where to find the key elements of the puzzles and the last card would give you the solution to the puzzles. Pulling out each card would cost you time units. The game is quite new and has its own code and logic; my group felt frustrated at some point because we didn't know where to look or what to look for even though we knew what we had to do. There are so many alternative paths that we got paranoid into thinking we had to start a new run and make new choices. Just a small help telling us that 'we had to look at the cards more carefully and that choices we make just slow us down and don't get us stuck' would have helped tremendously. Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective has something like this - you can go and talk to Sherlock anytime and most of the time his advice will be quite vague and encouraging, which is surprisingly enough to get us re-focused.
- The Asylum scenario is using many mechanics to make it artificially longer, a little bit like old video games (Resident Evil). Those mechanics are: (1) dice rolling for ability checks or moves, which get you closer to a re-run, (2) like in a maze, choices you make without any indication of the possible consequences and dead ends, (3) most of the progress made in a run is lost each time. As a consequence, the scenario doesn't always flow as nicely as it could.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After playing the first scenario, Asylum.

It's a great group storytelling experience, and you need the right group where people really get into the theme and enjoy exploring a narrative together. It can get pretty frustrating, yes, when you have to go back and do another run because you went down the wrong paths and fought monsters for nothing, but in hindsight, I'd say the important clues were fairly clearly important, and I didn't feel cheated in any way. A unique experience, and I love all the game mechanisms and how they come together. I'll look forward to trying out the other scenarios.

There is no replayability, of course. Absolutely none. You could wait 10 years and still not be able to forget enough to play a scenario again. In fact, you may never be able to play a scenario again, no matter how long you wait. But that said, I enjoyed the experience enough to continue with other scenarios.

Update: I've played the first three scenarios now, and so far my ranking of the three go: 1) Prophecy of Dragons, 2) Asylum, 3) the Marcy Case. Marcy Case was the shortest of the three, the easiest to solve, and the most straightforward. Prophecy of Dragons had some cool twists that completely challenged player expectations and the way time was managed. So long as they keep putting out good scenarios, I'll keep buying and playing them.

Lovely game, but here "experience" hits the head of the nail better. It is kind of guaranteed that you win against the game at the end. You play this game "once", but can spread this over 2 or 3 sessions (with the same players!), if you like.

Story and Art are really good, rulebook does not stand the test of the actual game (and not all mechanics can be explained before, as the scenarios might add or reuse stuff). Here the publisher missed to use well-defined keywords. If your group is in for the evening and spontaneous enough to interprete the upcoming situations without fearing that you are cheating, it works fine. It is also not that the rulebook itself is soo bad, just - it does not fit to the actual game :) . If you want to have fun, it'll be fine - you do not need to read all the Spoiling-QA threads from the forums.

I am a sucker for all things Time Travel and this game sleek design and game play had me from the get go. Yes, technically each scenario you play is a "one play only" since you know the outcome and certain things that are required to win. However, for any video gamers out there, the completion-ist in you will enjoy that you can win without seeing everything. So the replay for that aspect can be enjoyable.

This game is so unique and cool and immersive. Wow.  Pulled it out to play with my 8 year old when he was sick one day and we were immediately and thoroughly hooked. We played two "runs" immediately and considered a third.  Really looking forward to playing through the whole scenario. The only drawbacks are that playing with 2 is a disadvantage unless you each control two characters, and when you do that, it throws off one mechanism a bit - in that you each have 1/2 of the information instead of just 1/4, but with repeated runs that resolves anyway.  Also, it's clearly a consumable game. I'm okay with that, but it's just something to know. Since the goal is to figure out the best pathway through the game, once you figure this out there's little reason to play again.

Update: Finished the game with my son on our 5th play. Wow, what a fun experience! We cannot wait to get another scenario to run through. That said, I'm not a fan of the horror genre, and as it turned out, this deck had too many elements of violence/macabre/grim as well as a problematic  portrayal of mental health, so I found much that I had to gloss over or hide in the game with my 8 year old.  We're going to wait for the Dragon (Dec.) game and only buy the more family-friendly modules.

A decent story game with dice-rolling mechanics and some alternative paths through the scenarios. Highlight of the game are the moments when the location system is used for something unusual, such as setting up actual puzzles for the players to work out. The worlds and stories are not inspired enough to keep me engaged, as there are more satisfying games in the same genre out there.

In Asylum there is never much of a threat that you're going to die and for being a puzzle game there are really only 2 puzzles.  The ending is also a bit of a let down for us.

I had high expectations from the good reception in media. I expected puzzles like in the exit-room-games.

I can understand why it is rated highly.
My complain is that when you have to attempt a new run you loose all of the items-so going to the same locations again in order to find the important ones can be really tiring and boring.I know the other way would be a bit non thematic but in this temporal universe it seems that everything is a matter of telepathy and memory so maybe keeping some or all of the items and decreasing the number of temporal units on the next run, would give a balance to the game and become less tiring...
After all it is a beautiful and clever game.

RATING: 6.5
It's an interesting system and all of the art and flavour is very well done, it just takes too long. I love that it legitimately branches and that there's traps to avoid once you restart. I just don't like the amount of memory that's required if you play the rules as written. Also, once you know what you need to do there's a lot of tedious repetition before you can do it.

The 2 scenarios I've played have felt very similar and I don't have a huge drive to play more of them, because I feel like I've done what can be done with the system.

Asylum is a fine scenario and the 2 main puzzles (maze and pentagram) were fun, I'd probably rate it a 7. I would just rather play Unlock from the same publisher, it has the same card driven puzzle solving, except with that game you don't have any of the filler getting in the way.

Neat idea and undeniably cleverly crafted, but in the end the game penalizes you for exploring and instead expects you to more or less one-shot the whole thing. It's also built to play all episodes in order, so get ready to be frustrated when you finish case one.
You have to admit the idea is good and sounds interesting, but the game itself sadly is quite lackluster for a "once in a lifetime experience", especially the rather stupid and needless dice mechanic which comes down to pure luck and doesn't do the overall fun any good.

I bought it based on the hype but i was weary of another game that burns through an expansion as quickly as this. 

My thoughts:

1) It feels like a video game prototype mock up, not a board game. Which is not what i want. The structure of each type of game is different. If i wanted a video game feel id play a video game.


2) I found it very repetitive to keep going back to the beginning. 

3) You have to play it all in one sitting, or take copious notes because you will forget whats going on otherwise.

4) Absolutely must play with the same players in each play through because there will be no sense accomplishment otherwise.


Ultimately, without the repeating of the intro, this would be a very short game. Not for me. Not sure id recommend it BUT i would play a new module if someone else bought it.

4 hours = one playthrough. Overrated. Gameplay is fun, but in terms of "Wow this is cool", it's not really. It's like a point and click adventure turned into a board game, which is interesting, but doesn't blow my mind. First mission was fun, but anticlimactic. 

There's a bit too many fiddly rules for what is essentially an experience. That's not to say that the rules were complex - it's just that there were too many, especially when it came to combat.

Played through Asylum with Matt and Nathan.

Overall I enjoyed it, interesting puzzles and story but maybe a bit too drawn out.

General impression was that it wasn't the best use of boardgames as a format. The narrative and recursion was interesting but a bit fiddly: "This would work better as anything else" -Matt. A movie, book, or videogame could be much better appreciated by not having to go through the upkeep of the game and break narrative so often.

T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of "decksploration". Each player is free to give their character as deep a "role" as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.

A very different kind of game.  If you were to take a choose-your-own-adventure book and make it into a co-op board game, you would have TIME Stories. A pass takes ~2 hrs and I've found us finishing after 2 passes, though our group may cheat a little bit here and there. Fun depends heavily on the quality of the story. The base game comes with one of the best stories, it seems.

A very nice looking game with some really cool ideas, but there are too many gnawing rules issues that can be very annoying to resolve since you're trying not to accidentally see anything you're not supposed to see. The fun also swings wildly based on which scenario you're playing and the gameplay tends to either bog down in writing down/memorizing every detail in an attempt to puzzle everything out or become heavily repetitious as you have to repeat the same encounters over and over again.

One of the most intriguing storytelling games I've ever played. Interesting mysteries, captivating puzzles, and really excruciating decisions makes this game a must play. The only downside is that it's pretty expensive for what you get and the missions really aren't replayable and the game is really at it's core intended for 4 players, so playing with less reveals some holes in the narrative. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Good deep game but has little replayability. Like all scenario-based games, it has a very short life. There should have been several stories in the main box. Just one stack of cards is lame. Cards costs almost nothing in game producing.

Another big plus, no uncreative victory points. Finaly some people know that there are other ways to determine winner(s) aside from victory points.

I prefer replayable games since I get my money back in fun for a very very long time. T.I.M.E. Stories is a very short lived game that you play once, no point playing it again.

Ah yeah, designers are too mentally lazy to create a proper 2-player variant. Sucks for all couples out there.

Also, this game is small and should not cost alot, especially the expansions who are just a bunch of cards and like I said, cards are inexpensive to produce. Because of the hilarious high price of this game, you can be certain I will never buy this thing for just 5-10 hours of gameplay. I'd rather buy four to six movies for the same price to add to my collection. But for 12$-15$ per expansion (for a pack of cards) and 35$ for the base game, maybe I would think about buying it, but it would be just a little maybe. Too short lived game that is really not worth the price tag. It,s basically a card game and thus should be super cheap.

If the price was reasonable or if the mechanics could allow you to experience a new story each time to play the game up to a certain point (let's say like in 10 games you would have gone through most if not all of the possibilities), then perhaps the game would be worth buying. But right now, because of the ridiculous high price plus the one-shot deal nature of the game, I give it a 5 out of 10, really unfortunate, because they had a nice idea but like so many designers out there, came short of it.

If there is a PC game version that comes out at low price, I will probably buy it. But never as a board game, not worth the money.

I have played the base game. I did enjoy it but I found it to really rely on basically a single puzzle. once you figured that out you basically walked through the rest of it. but it was a fun ride to get there and I have never felt that level of accomplishment after having finished a game. I do hope to be able to get into a couple expansions.

I don't like coops in general.  This game is very good looking, but remaking the panoramas is totally annoying.  I sort of like games like mansions, but this one does not have the same immersive feel.  Add in the fact that one can't play any adventure more than once, so if it gets messed up, then that is your flawed experience forever.

RATING: 7
First runs in the scenario are heaps of fun - innovative design, elegant puzzle solving and information sharing while diving into the story (which, at least for the second scenario, is fairly cliché ridden, but it works). 

Then there's the replayability issue, of course - but even after the first runs, while we were still trying to solve the case, I got an increasing sense of going through the motions, simply trying to optimize my initial steps rather than getting engrossed in the story again.

As a huge fan of classic adventure games this should be right up my alley. At the end of the day this is fascinating but probably not as interesting as it could have been.

There is no doubt that TIME Stories is my favorite board game of all time. In short, the scenarios are highly thematic, and it totally elevates the board-gaming experience by immersing you and 3 other friends into the world which they have built around each scenario.

Will also like to point out that each component of this game, from the card stock/finishing on them to the wooden components are totally top notch. It feels and handles great and is such a joy to play.

I can't wait for more scenarios to bring myself back through time to discover what is to come again.

What an amazing game. Me and my wife found ourselves deeply in the zone and connected to the story. It's like playing an old adventure game by Lucasfilms (or even Sierra :P ) in a board game. So much fun. I don't even care it 's a single play, I will definitely be buying the other expansions.

RATING: 6
In terms of its physical construction--the way it uses components to do things heretofore unseen in board games--it is a stellar achievement, worth experiencing especially if you are a somewhat jaded boardgamer. In terms of theme and story, it is a rather significant missed opportunity in that is a rather hackneyed take on an overused theme.
It also has puzzles. I hate puzzles.

It is a simple board game and a quite a simple story, but it combines into something really immersive. The puzzle in the first scenario is great and I did immediately crave for more. Now when I write this I have also played "Under the mask" and still want more.

However, it is not without faults. As with other "play once" games (such as the legacy game) if you miss something in the rules or on some card you can become stuck and have a not so great experience. You can't just shrug it off and say that you will do it correctly the next time you play since there won't be a next time.

Also, the 90 minutes of playtime seems to be the absolute minimum you can possibly play the game in. I do not know of anyone completing a scenario in less then four hours.

Looks like:

Co-op "experience" game, 2 or 3 sessions, then the story's done. Some folks can play it faster, but generally it seems those players enjoy it less. New stories come in expansions. Nice art, though reviews are mixed about the story quality. Story involves time travel, Quantum Leap style, with PCs able to loop back to correct mistakes of the past.

"Asylum" is the first story.

I'd like to try it.

***Spoilers***

The hype probably didn't help, but man this "game" is crappy.
The whole aspect of using time units to create urgency might've been a good idea in theory but with all storytelling games introducing mechanics to insert "a game" to just a round of storytelling, it utterly fails and hinders immersion into the game.

What would've helped greatly is if the story was anything good, but it's not. It is super generic, Asylum, Crazies, Ghouls, Secret Ritual, Dark Magic, zzzZZZzzz.. And there is NO! Backstory to immerse yourself into.. with a proper backstory like in Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective you have to be attentive and search for clues.. here you just stumble along from one random non-connected encounter to the next.

e.g.: "You walk in the park, there is a man that points a gun at you." hm.. okay.. the card says we can fight him or talk him out of killing us. We choose to talk him out of it. Roll dice. Success. "The guy "*insert random french name here" comes along, you can spend him to soak 3 damage."
That's it?! Who did he think we were..? How did we convince him..? Why is he in the asylum..? Why is he now willing to sacrifice his life for us..? Nothing..

And the worse part is when you run out of TU (time units) you have to re-do the deck & start almost all over again. We were looking at each other and no one wanted to.. so we just kept playing. That reset feels like it was built in to artificially extend the game lenght.. as to make it more reasonable to spend 40 bucks on a game you only play once.

I'm sure the designers intention was to create something great, but at least for me, this ship sank the second i realied that the story was crap. Because then there's nothing left.

While the artwork is phenomenal, the rulebook is pretty bad too. What a let down.

Interesting experience, but found it lacking in game play.

When we've completed a scenario there's always been a kind of anti-climax. A feeling of "Was that it?". I never felt like I've accomplished anything or made any decisions that actually mattered. The game is about exploring all available options, because each one (and you don't know which) might be key to success. There is not much actual game in this game.
I do however like watching the story unfold. It's the saving grace of the game. (That and the fact that I've split the cost of the game+expansions among several friends).

The scoring mechanism is also pretty bad. It's an exploration game that rewards you for not exploring the game completely. I'd recommend ignoring the scoring and explore each scenario to it's fullest. You only get to play it once in a meaningful fashion. Make as much out the experience as possible.

The concept is really cool, but the scenarios are a very once and done kind of thing. It's like a mystery novel, once you know the answer, you KNOW the answer. After playing through the scenario, it's unlikely you would want to pull it out again with the same group. Luckily there is a constant stream of expansion scenarios as well as fan made scenarios to keep the game alive and fresh. Some of the puzzles included in just the base game are brain melters if you're not paying attention!

This suffers for me because it's a co-op and I generally am not a fan. I love point and click adventure games, and I respect they way they managed to replicate one in board game form, but I still don't think it translates well. Worse still, it reminds me of Tales of the Arabian Nights in the sense that the choices I make and their outcomes seem arbitrary. Repeating the scenario until you make all the right choices particularly hurts this game for me, as I abhor backtracking in video games, and it feels like even more of a grind in board game form. I respect this game but do not enjoy it.

[b]tl;dr[/b] — All the mechanical aspects of a complete RPG adventure in a deck of cards.  Fragile and group-dependent, but deeply satisfying when it works.

[COLOR=#FF0000]THE FOLLOWING IS CERTIFIED SPOILER-FREE[/COLOR]

"B-Team!  We're sending you in because A-Team went all 'dynamite and fire' on the situation.  You'll be inserted an hour ahead of their arrival—get it right, save some lives.  Dismissed and godspeed!"

[i]One hour later...[/i]

B-Team is vomited from their pods into heaps, snazzy jumpsuits soiled with effluent, sweaty hair pasted in streaks on retching faces.  Someone's crying.  The Time Captain, curled up like a bug, lets out a wheezing croak:

"Need... more... [i]dynamite[/i]..."

[microbadge=36241]

[b]After 4 plays:[/b]  All the mechanical aspects of a complete RPG adventure in a deck of cards.  It's up to you and your friends to actually breathe life into this, but for us, as veteran role-players, it was absolutely perfect.  We banged out "Asylum" across two sessions, with the usually-busy players burning an entire Saturday afternoon (something that NEVER happens) for the final run-through.  I pretty much want everyone I love who also loves RPGs to take a trip through this.

We beat "Asylum" (just barely) and the experience left us with the real treasure of such things:  darkly hilarious emergent narratives that are on track to become Canon Lore in our group.  And only the best adventures do that.

Now, I can totally see how this could fall flat for straight-up board gamers, and even for ardent RPGers—but I really appreciate how it hits somewhere in the middle.  As an RPGer I'm not at all put off by the one-shot nature of the scenarios, seeing this as an elaborate board game–based RPG.  With the lack of Game Master or any required prep (other than sitting down and flipping the first card), this will be our go-to for those RPG nights when we don't have a quorum.*

[size=7]*Of course, this means everyone will always show up so they don't miss out if we're one short, which is another way of saying it'll never get played again...[/size]

I'm down for wherever the system takes me.

[b]After 11 plays:[/b]  Deep into [i]Prophecy of Dragons[/i] it's become clear that this is not just another random adventure scenario, but the third chapter in a much larger, overarching story. I am in awe at the ambitiousness of the project—using a board game as a framing device for serial storytelling—but have no idea if they can stick the landing. But goddamn, [i]the ride[/i]. Such a ride. I'd take it into a brick wall it's so sweet.

[o]The worst thing about Time Patrol is talking to the guy who you know is going to get eaten by the monster for the third time.  The first time you have [i]no idea[/i], and so you're all "Hey, man, how's it goin'?" with honest, fate-ignorant friendliness.  The second time you're startled to see him, and then you're flashing back on the whole monster thing, and like one moment it's him, [i]right there[/i], and the next it's how surprised and terrified and then resigned he looked getting gnashed and slurped and sucked into some kind of otherworldly gullet, and he's startled at your startlement because he doesn't even know you, man, and that look, that awful familiar look, reverberates between your two faces and the one he's going to make like 20 minutes from now when, you know,[i] monster[/i].  But that [i]third[/i] time, that's the really bad one.  Once you convince him to come with—and he shouldn't, what with the way you're utterly failing to sell it:  "Oh, we're not [i]sorcerers[/i], we're [i]time travelers[/i], you know, from the [i]future[/i],"—he's all gung-ho to get to it like [i]right now[/i] and you're all, "Hey, look—a butterfly," and "How's your mom?  Maybe you should write her a note," and "You know this is harder on me, right?" and then you take three steps to the left.[/o]
PS.  My Time Patrol callsign is "Clocky"—on account of my penchant for randomly punching people.  "What?  They're already dead where we come from!"

[b]Asylum[/b]
3 runs, score of... [i]1[/i].
2 runs as backseater, score of 34.

[i]Elation & despair.[/i]  One moment had me turning away from the table, staggering a few steps and then dropping to my knees in defeat; later, solving the central puzzle was a "tumblers of Creation falling into place" moment, the kind that causes four-hour erections.

The final encounter went the way most of our RPG climaxes go—disappointing if you were settled in with popcorn for a 20-minute action sequence—but hilarious from our perspective when "those guys" (us) show up at precisely the right time to make a hash out of everything in 30 seconds flat.

I loved this more than I can say.

Alle Spieler mit Hang zum Eskapismus werden dieses Spiel lieben. Man kann es tatsächlich als eine Art "Rollenspielbaukasten" bezeichnen, wodurch das Spiel auch von den Mitspielern lebt. Thematisch sehr dicht.
Das Rücksetzen nach einem fehlgeschlagenen Durchlauf kann gelegentlich frustrieren.
Das erste mitgelieferte Szenario "die Nervenheilanstalt" ist gleich eines der besseren Szenarien. Ihm allein hätte ich eine "8" gegeben, muss hier aber auch die Spielidee würdigen.

My problem with this game is the random time captain dice for moving and complete reboot with new dice rolls for every test. Little downside on failing except for a few spots and not much fun doing reruns for the n'th time.

Many great ideas, but implementation is lacking. This is not an adventure game, but much more like a rogue-style game and sadly it doesn't really know what it wants to be. You can see yourself running out of time far too early and that puts a lid on the excitement. There are bright points - find a new way to the same target.

Some stuff can probably be fixed in the stories - maybe there will be a reimplementation that makes it much more enjoyable. 

Altså, it suffers from translations obviously (in the Asylum case, at least) is from another language and doesn't always flow well.

T.I.M.E. Stories is not only a standalone game (The Asylum adventure comes in the box), but also an engine for future paid expansions, free-to-print ones, and ones of your own design.

The Asylum has variable player powers, leading to some interesting player interaction, a fairly standard adventure in a well-trodden path (spooky asylum with weird characters), and a mix of brilliant and painful puzzles -- sometimes both at once!

Now that we've played five adventures, The Asylum sits comfortably in the middle of the pack. Averaging all three of our opinions, it's ranked third.

As for the mechanisms itself, T.I.M.E. Stories is a strange mixture of RPG, point-and-click adventure, and a Euro-style route optimization game. 

T.I.M.E. Stories doesn't always work, and I wouldn't outright recommend buying it, but I definitely recommend trying it.

Not bad, but definitely not Top 100!

Feels like a FindYourFate-Book from the 80s. Go to the left => you are dead. Go to the right => yeah, you beat the dragon! (Or like Monkey Island. Run around, combine everything, save, load and win. But FYF is a better comparison.)

In this game the the journey is the goal. It is not (at all!) important what you do, why you do it and which monsters you beat. Just do anything in the first two runs (you can't win them anyway). Maybe you have a chance in the 3rd run and figure it all together for the fourth.

I had fun playing it, but it feels not really satisfying to solve the story. 

I know that comparisons are difficult. But I'll do it anyway. If I compare it to Andor, Andor is a lot stronger. You can beat the legendes in Andor in your 1st play. You need a bit of luck (of course), but your decisions lead to something.

It is a weird (type of ?) game. Fun, but not satisfying. And/But because I love gaming, I will have to try another story ;-)

After reading some reviews, I wasn't sure if this game would take within our group.  It has been the most talked about game we've played together since.  Long durations, but really unique gameplay and potential combinations to solve puzzles while accomplishing a goal together.  Easily a '10', but the non-replay is the only things keeping this from perfect.

Great game, but one big nitpick:  the rules are pretty confusing at first.  Playing the Asylum scenario took three runs, but I think we were well into the second run before we felt like we were actually playing the right way.  Out of the box, the game is already very limited in terms of the amount of gameplay, and it is unfortunate that half of that time was spent (by us) stumbling around and trying to figure the game itself out.  Once we were sure of what we were doing, though, the game ran smoothly and was a very entertaining (but short) experience.

I bought this after reading so many attests to the quality of it but finished unsatisfied, feeling more negatively towards it after we finished. Honestly, if there was more than the one campaign in it (or if the campaign was at least better) I may have left with a more positive opinion but after the second session (where we finished the game) and had nothing else to do. When Pandemic Legacy is another $20 from the same place, there is a strong feeling of being ripped off by the creators. 
Yes there are expansions and its clearly a game meant to be expanded upon for the full experience but that's not a valid ~$60 each, a whole two thirds of the original game's price (for what I can tell is just a pack of cards). If the expansions were half that price, I would probably be more willing to at least try and expand upon what is actually a really sharply made setting (another dissapointment in what should have resulted in a better product overall). 
If the base game felt stronger, if the expansions were cheaper, if the base game was cheaper, if I didn't go into it expecting something much better (at overall rank of 25 at time of purchase, I don't think it is a mistake on my part), i probably would have had a more enjoyable experience and perhaps getting the expansions later would be fuelled by a desire to see what else happens and enjoy the stories they're trying to tell, rather than trying to justify buying the game in the first place.

The games are spectacular, I haven't had a better gaming experience ever. Each story is unique and so much fun and challenging. I have yet to play it by the complete legit rules but I'm not sure I even want to, the way we're playing it we get to feel empowered but not too powerful and everyone is working together to solve the mysteries! Can not recommend it more! Go get it now.

Coming back after playing a few more scenarios. They range from amazing (asylum and dragons) to really good (marcy case) to just good (under the mask). Hoping some of the new stories bring it back up.

This game was brilliant, we didn't plan on playing all our runs in one day but it was too much fun not to finish seeing what else was in the game.

I want to like this game more than I do.  It's great that it offers an RPG-like experience without a game master, but I find the super loose mechanics to be a turn off.  And the ideas that time travel is costly enough to constantly berated for failure, yet your team is sent back blind and has to figure everything out from 0 at the start of each scenario.

Maybe it's just my general dis-taste for co-ops, but with my background in RPGs, I would just rather spend an evening role playing than playing this game.

SO much fun. as a mystery co-op game, I love that although it may take a few rounds before you can complete the game, it's a blast. The level of detail, the art, the mechanics... just everything, I absolutely adore this game... just wish there were more expansions/different stories ... I have a good memory, so I'd know how to solve it. And that'd be the only way to make the game better... make challenges so when you redo the story beating it in a certain amount of turns with certain items or something challenging would just be the icing on the cake.

Incredibly fun.  Novel concept, good mysteries, good puzzles, just a blast.

But I feel I *have* to tick this down for the horrendous lack of polish.

The rulebook and rules on the cards are really terrible.  This game is really a layer of polish away from completion.

Additionally, the tweaking and the way the story filters out was playtested for like the 50th percentile, and more work would have cleaned up the mission further.

First playthrough is fun, but after having to restart because of running out of time with basically the only difference being that you know some of the dead ends to avoid, in a game which doesn't have much gameplay and is all about the story, it just gets repetitive and boring. In my opinion would probably be better without the time management, which would then lead to one fun playthrough, but would of course decrease the time you get out of the game even more (but since the second playthrough wasn't much fun for me anyways, this doesn't change much).

RATING: 6.5
Indifferent

(No spoilers)

The design is innovative, it's probably the first RPG board game with the whole scenario embedded inside a single deck, which players get to explore. The art is amazing also. I will give an 8 to the idea of T.I.M.E series. But the Asylum, which is the only scenario provided in the base game, is just OK.

Asylum is quite a maze-like structure, although it's very thematic. It has some apparent flaws(see below), and is probably not reaching the full potential of the structure of T.I.M.E.

The TU unit provided in the scenario seems too less. According to comments on BGG, I am not the only one who runs the puzzle more than three times and the game drags, long and repetitive. Some simple math may reveal "expectation value of TU consumption to solve the scenario" will prove the 25/30 TU units is enough or not.

Also, the branches in the plot are just too meaningless, they are there for the sake of consuming your TU, adding only very little toward the main theme/plot.

Finally, it's pricey to play just basic scenario. IMO it requires at least two to three scenarios to justify the price. So, it's absolutely new with lots of novelty here, but expensive for its one-time-play nature.

I recommend this game just to those who are super excited about new and interesting ideas.

Absolutely fantastic RPG/Boardgame fusion. It's all the good parts of D&D with almost none of the bad ones (although it does still have roll-to-resolve). It's a shared storytelling game set up as a deck of cards with a set location row. Also, excellent box insert design (with the exception that the time-tracker token is an absolute bitch to get out of the slots provided for it, and that the secondary player pawn slots don't support vertical storage).

The only thing keeping me from giving this a 10 is that I'm pretty sure I won't be playing it again after we finish the scenario. Expansions coming, though.

My wife and I were really enjoying this game up until near the end, when we got stuck on something small (our fault, really, but it was something we missed on an accessory card). Because of the fact that it is a play-once game, and because we had a very anti-climatic ending, I can't give it more than a 7.

The central mechanic of Time Stories, repeating a story multiple times until you finally solve the mystery in the allotted time is really cool and amazingly thematic. My problem is that it is just not very fun, the first time through is pretty fun but I start getting really impatient after the 2nd time through and it starts to become a massive chore to go through the motions. On top of that the gameplay is not particularly interesting; standard RPG light mechanics of have an encounter roll a check against your stats.

That being said the first mission that comes in the box was pretty fun but there is absolutely 0 replay value and I'm glad I'm not the one who bought this.

Rather disappointing after the first 2 runs. Narration and phases are pretty similar to other games like Arkham Horror LCG and Mansions of Madness, but this one has much less replayability than those. Nothing particularly fascinating, starting with an investigation that is more like "let's try this, then let's go there and see what happens" than actually finding clues and unravelling a mystery, which would have been much more interesting. So, no big deal after all that hype that preceded it.

RATING: 6
The scenario that comes with the core set is excellent and we had much fun.  It is an RPG where they have very cleverly automated the gamesmaster role.  The card deck not only describes that various possible encounters, they also provide very atmostpheric illustrations of the locations (it's a Lovecraftian setting in an insane asylum).  The encounters have a good dab of humor and the puzzles are just the right level of challenge, not impossible but hard enough that you feel good about figuring them out or dorky if you don't.  Unfortunately, the scenario packs that came after are not so good.  I enjoyed the Marcy case but not as much.  The Dragons one after that we couldn't get ourselves to finish.  I hear the Egyptian one is even worse.  So good fun the first time but not much replay value to this one.  For the one play through of the core set, it would be an 8, but docking it a couple stars because that's about all you'll get out of it.

So it's a 9 in gameplay and a 7 overall because we don't want to play it every time we have a chance.

From a board game perspective, it's not so great.  Roll a few dice, decide how to use the few resources you get through the game.

I have to say that I loved playing T.I.M.E Stories with my friends. But, we all grew incredibly frustrated by consistent dead ends, red herrings, and ultimately, the stories ending felt incredibly hollow. When you invest a ton of time into a roleplaying game that is a one-time story, the ending should leave you feel accomplished or impacted emotionally and this failed to do either.

This game is amazing. It made me want to play it nonstop but sad that I can't replay it with the group I had. At least not with this scenario. Which leads me to the fact that it made me want to buy every expansion for it, which rarely happens in a game. Worth every penny.

A really involved choose your own adventure style coop game, with unique scenarios and gameplay. A great storytelling experience in which you want to try stuff and not just optimise your every move. Is the game tricking you? or are you supposed to know the game is tricking you, so that it is not tricking you? GAH! so much fun, so much flavour.

Asylum, the scenario that comes in the box, is for me the most memorable and probably tied for the best so far.

The puzzles and art are amazing. That moment when you figure out what you need to do and get to the end of a scenario it feels really good.

Once you've solved a scenario you're pretty much done with it which is a bit of a letdown but that makes the experience count for that much more.

The asylum scenario that comes with it feels very good. The characters fit the theme very well and the experiences in the adventure really help the overall feel of the scenario.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (July 2016)

I initially resisted the urge to buy and play the game. In my mind, playing a game only once wasn’t worthy of my time. I’m glad I changed my opinion about the game, but the replayability factor remains a thorny issue in my mind, due to this the game is very expensive as it has a limited life, once you know the answer to the puzzle there is no motivation to play it again! Having saying that, T.I.M.E Stories offers a rich and thematic experience reminiscent of the old point and click videogames adventures. My game group and I, really enjoyed it and they are very happy that I’m the one buying the game and its expansions ;) (which I already pre ordered).

T.I.M.E Stories is a cooperative game in which you have to solve a mystery.

The rules are pretty easy to learn and teach, you can explain the game under 8 minutes. Unfortunately, the rulebook has many holes in it and some things aren’t clear after reading it. You need to read the FAQ ASAP, the explanation on status tokens is abysmal on the rulebook.

The game comments are very well done, but the art is excellent. Perhaps the best art I have seen in a recent boardgame. The gameplay is also very fun, I particularly like that you don’t have to read out loud the cards you access, but you have to transmit your sensations to your fellow players, that’s neat!

The theme of the game is awesome! Time Travel is always a favorite of mine and the game does a great job of transmitting it to the players. I understand that each module will have a different theme!

The insert looks cool and it, supposedly, allows you to save the game if you need to leave an unfinished adventure, but it isn’t functional, if you lean the box sideways all the bits will get messy and, most annoying to me, you cannot fit all the cards once sleeved. I know the cards suffer very little during the game but I ALWAYS sleeve my games or they don’t get played (that’s just how it is with me), so it bothers me when I need to use another container for the sleeved cards :angry:. We sleeved the cards while we were playing it to avoid any spoilers :D.

T.I.M.E Stories is very novel, but you need the correct mind set and correct game group to play it. Our group was into the characters and we had a blast. It is way better when you role play it a bit!

As I love memory in games, we played it that we weren’t allowed to take notes unless a week or more passes between plays. As I turned out, we remembered all the clues rather easily. For me, this is the way to play the game, otherwise, the difficulty would plunge!

After analyzing the zero replayability issue a bit more, I have come to the conclusion that I can live with it. I’m disappointed that the base game comes with only one scenario and you can play thought it rather quick :(, making the game very expensive, but in general, it doesn’t bother me that the game can be played only once because I retain the value of the game (unlike Legacy games). If I have financial trouble I know I can sell the game for some money so I have made my peace with it. Perhaps I will sell it after we play through all the scenarios, perhaps not, I haven’t decided yet, but the important thing is that I CAN sell it after playing it.

I heavily dislike Legacy games, I come from a third world country and since I was a child I was taught to not generate waste, so the idea of permanently change a game is anathema to me. When I do that, I lose all the financial value of the game (I cannot sell an used copy if I want to) and I facilitate the generation of waste. I’m sure all the Legacy games could be done in a way that you could reset them to their initial estate without losing any of the fun and/or surprises of playing through them (examples of this that come to mind are T.I.M.E Stories and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords – Base Set). I understand that the permanent change is the point of the Legacy system, but I cringe every time I see a friend tearing the components of the game. I know I’m in the small minority here :D, but that’s the reason I dislike Legacy games, for me those games are really disposable and that makes me sad. 

Returning to T.I.M.E Stories, here are some thoughts on the first scenario, be careful if you want to play the game as there can be some MAJOR spoilers in it.

[o]
The creepy theme of The Asylum is great. I love it and the art is very well done. This makes the game not suitable for little children though!

It was great experience, we finished it after 3 plays and I think it is designed that way. I’m disappointed in the emergency protocol, that gave us unlimited time to finish the game and the only variable was the TU and the score. I’m disappointed because the game gives unlimited resources to finish it. I understand the game designers did that so players wouldn’t get tired of the game, but to me, it defeats the purpose of the game, finishing the mission BEFORE you run out of TUs. I would have liked it better if we had to repeat more times the scenario and that also would have make each play more cheaper (financially speaking), that is, I would have loved to play the game more times than 3 before the end. I hope that’s not the case in future scenarios.

I also felt the puzzles were very easy to solve. The main clues were glaringly obvious (the painting in the Day Room, the painting in the doctor’s office, the pentagrams. etc.). Although I wasn’t the one to solve it at the end, it took less than a minute to do so once we had all the clues. I enjoyed the red herrings!

I knew the beacons were there before playing the game as I always check all my games before playing them :(, however you are supposed to destroy them once you used them and I heavily dislike that. I’m glad you can use them without physically destroying them, otherwise I wouldn’t play the game again.[/o]

Bottom line, I really like T.I.M.E Stories and I will buy and play all its scenarios. I’m undecided if after that I will keep the game or not, but after playing it, many friends who saw us have a high interest in it. Perhaps I will lend it to those friends. For now, T.I.M.E Stories is a keeper for me, although that’s a bit of a cheat as the game has no staying power, so it is almost by definition, not a keeper. T.I.M.E Stories offers a compelling experience that I haven’t felt before and my SO loves it. Nowadays, I have drifted away from most themed games, but I’m all for T.I.M.E Stories, an unique game.

Literally stands for a new category of gaming "Decksploration".  Very immersive and fun experience. Provides a great thematic mystery to solve with a spouse/partner.

Fantastic game of story immersion. As Time Travel agents, your team is sent back to 1920's London to stop a time rift from expanding. You only have so many time units and when they expire, you return to the present as a failure. After a lecture of disappointment from Bob, you are returned to continue your task (in Grounhog Day style). The puzzle and challenge is to complete the mission within the given time units. It's is incredibly engaging as your group learns tidbits to piece together the details of the era.

The original rulebook, unfortunately, has too many omissions and typos, however, the fun in the gameplay is much more about the experience than the rules. I believe most played through this scenario with some sort of mistakes in rules since they are so muddy. Space Cowboys is lucky that the game is so innovative that this glaring mistake can be forgiven. Thanks to Paul Grogan for stepping up and FAQing the primary rules!

I have found my game group (my two daughters and my brother) for this and we plan to play every expansion scenario as they're released.

I had high hopes for this game but it fell WAY short of my expectations.  The stories are only poorly written and some of the expansions are designed to make it impossible for you to win on the first try.  They literally take all of your time away, force you to lose and then start the story over with a different deck which alters the story... While this sounds interesting, it isn't.  There often is no specific mission so you have no idea what you are trying to accomplish and are forced to just wanter around the game board aimlessly.

Probably one of the best games I've ever played. I am biased because this game acted as my "gateway" game into the boardgaming community. Very thematic. Beautiful artwork. Co-op. Deduction.

Wow, what a game! My wife and I get more invested in this with each new expansion. Love the components. Not just the way they look, but also the flexibility they have between modules. Love the theme and how it is implemented in each new case. The one and done aspect of this is really overblown by some people. If I can play for three or four hours, maybe more, and feel invested in what's going on I can find value in that. Don't get hung up if you make a rules mistake, it is not that big a deal. You get better with every run. You will eventually get comfortable with the rules and how they are implemented in your groups current case. Enjoy the experience. I like this one better every time I play it. Great game.

A collaborative puzzle-solving game that takes advantage of board gaming materials by having cards for maps, encounters and evidence, and dice to determine your ability to overcome the challenges that come during the investigation. Playing the game, it's obvious that the game is structured in such a way that every expansion can be different in arrangement. It's also extremely obvious that players need a great memory or you will find yourself unable to solve the problem within the two chances you're given. The replay ability is all dependent on how much you remember months later.

PLUS: solid opportunities for different challenges, requires a lot of interaction
MINUS: the memory requirement

So, this is basically a Choose Your Own Adventure story with nice illustrations and co-op multiplayer gameplay.  Like the books, you'll probably "lose" and have to start over at least once.  There are some puzzles to solve, sort of, and a time element that encourages you to be careful choosing which locations seem like the most prudent to visit instead of just exploring everything.  All in all I think pretty entertaining and very different than any other sort of board game.  Zero replay value though keeps me from recommending it much.

The context of the game is that the players are essentially "time police" who travel to other times and "other realities" in order to prevent time anomalies caused by other time travelers or events. This pretty much leaves the door open for adventures to be set in any theme or time period. Because of this, the pawns and tokens that come with the game are intensely generic as they can represent different things in different adventures. The rule book tries to straddle the line between telling you how to play and not giving anything away. It unfortunately errs on the side of being coy, leaving some basic sections of the game board unexplained! We pretty much just put things out where it seemed to make sense and it was fine. Fortunately, there are not many rules and the flow is fairly intuitive once you get into it.

The heart of the game is in discovering locations, exploring locations, and passing tests - trying to figure out and meet the success conditions before time is up. As you discover locations, four cards representing a map gets updated with new cards. In the most cool and innovative aspect of the game, each location is represented by a panorama of cards depicting people and things in the location. Each card in the panorama can be explored separately or together by each player resulting in different encounters and pieces of information. You can't share your card with players in other parts of the location, but you describe and discuss what you've discovered. Locations also have non-panoramic cards that can be visited or turned over when its requirements are met. The panoramas open a window to the theme and setting nicely and the encounters are basic, but not poorly done.

My main concern at this point is that the game is a bit too much of trial-and-error to succeed. Many times you cannot know that an action is a time-waster until you do it and can only avoid it on the next run after you fail. I don't dislike this aspect of the game, but many of these encounters will lock you in until you succeed in the test and it can make the game feel less about deduction and more about turning over the wrong card. But, that's probably the nature of the beast....

We played with 2 players and enjoyed the game immensely. We played through 2 times before realizing that we were playing wrong; spending more time units than required when exploring a new location. As a game system, we are really excited about playing the next scenarios as they come available. We'll see how they meet expectations. Obviously, with a rating of 9, we really liked the game, but I'll point out a few negatives about the system and this first scenario. 
1) The rules just aren't clear enough. They have been intentionally left vague so they fit multiple scenarios, but really need to be tightened up for each scenario.
2) The story is really rambling and while enjoyable, there is no way to know the right path to take. Since the wrong paths are interesting, this isn't so bad. It is like a choose your own adventure book that requires that you read every possible paragraph to make sure you don't miss something.
3) Possible (small, non-specific) SPOILER for Asylum: Having written several professional dinner theater mysteries, I have a complaint that may not bother others. One of the puzzles "breaks the 4th wall" (in a cheap way) which a) made the puzzle confusing and, more important, b) broke the thematic immersion of the players in the game. The clue refers to the game system instead of a story element. Not only was it poorly done, but there was no reason for it. The puzzle could have just as easily referred to a story element and could have been great. Hopefully, this is an early mistake that won't be made in future scenarios.

played the entire game in less than three hours.  Not really a game as I define it.  More like an experience, a puzzle, a choose your own adventure mashed with groundhog day.  Not my cup of tea.  Shocked how popular it is given, that BGG members frequently pine on about replay-ability and gaming value.  I could care less about the cost, I only care that it wan't that fun, in fact quite boring.  Felt like I was in a team building seminar course more than anything.

Such an interesting beast. I usually hate the "fail to see what you did wrong" mechanic but it works so well here in the groundhog day-esque setting. The core rules are well done and the test system is interesting (though the rulebook itself is not all that well written). We are having a little bit of a hard time making sure we account for all TU expenditure. As for Asylum, the included first scenario, it's great. A lot of interesting puzzles everywhere and it left all of us discussing and theorizing after every game. If there's one major complaint, it's that it's very possible to run out of time RIGHT before you would have won, meaning that you may have to play an extra 15-20 minutes even speeding back through to that last room where a bad test may have made you lose the last TU you needed to win.

It's main problem is that lacks replayability. Most likely you end up with a bunch of components you'll never use again. Once you've played the basic game you just need to keep spending money in expansions as the game gets totally spoiled in one go. That would not be much of a problem if all of it would be cheaper.

I think that this game tries to emulate the experience of playing an RPG. To be fair it kind of succeeds, but it left me with the impression I would just had a better time playing it as an RPG adventure. That would have make it cheaper as well, and the replayability would have been less of an issue (less wasted components, easier creation of home-made adventures...).

I could play it again (i.e. other adventures), but I'll not spend my money (and my space) on it.

Nunca había probado un juego como éste. Tan inmersivo que no te deja soltarlo hasta que lo terminas por completo. Se presta a rolear, a meterte en el personaje hasta el punto de provocar situaciones muy graciosas e hilarantes. Increíble y con ganas de seguir jugando con otras misiones, y a repetir la primera para ver todos los detalles que nos hemos perdido. Increíble es poco.

The first exploration of the time story included in the box was fascinating. An experience that is hampered only slighty by the well-worn probe resolution known from a hundred other thematic games. I really want to solve this case. Too bad, that there's only a single case in it. And I was bothered that Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective only included 10 cases. At least, it isn't legacy and can be used by another group of players after a playthrough.

The production value is great, the artwork is appealing. This is a good system that hopefully will be supported with new cases for years to come.

Comments and rating to follow...

Just played through the Asylum case, and really liked it! Four players, and we saw most of the things, and made it through on our third run... Mechanics are simple enough to mostly avoid doubts, confusion and rulebook flicking...  

And then we did something completely crazy! After finishing the Asylum, we had dinner, and then we went ahead and played the Marcy Case... We should probably have saved it for another day, as it ran a bit late and we were all tired and a bit spaced out at the end. But we did it, two scenarios in one day...

Cool experience, love the whole exploration mechanic, getting deeper into the story, uncovering the mystery.

RATING: 5
A Zork-style game brought to the boardgame world. Essentially, players are examining rooms and picking up items to solve puzzles in other rooms. The "secrecy" made the game SO much harder to learn, simply because we didn't want to spoil any secrets so we were extra careful. But honestly, it wasn't necessary, and in fact was detrimental to learning the game.

For a game that can only be played once, this game is frighteningly expensive, even more so when you consider the cost of a single expansion.

And a last note about the combat system -- it really detracted from the puzzle solving aspect of the game. There seemed to be a lot of combat without any purpose (aside from wasting time). I think this game is an interesting experiment, but one that a computer would handle better.

I'm only judging the first case here, which was incredibly fiddly and involved a lot of running around for lackluster return. Especially in some situations.. 

Strange choice for a first scenario in my opinion. Grim and disturbing as you'd expect from a mental asylum, not the most comfortable or (personally) engaging experience. The system itself and the way combat is handled is just okay, it's not exactly clever or new, it does the job. 

The expansion really elevated my opinion however. The correct story can be a great experience. Asylum itself, ehn... If this was the entire game without further expansions I wouldn't have been impressed whatsoever.

RATING: 7.5
Based on a playthrough of "Asylum" with the base game. This is a very interesting game, unlike anything I've played before. Very intriguing story-driven game with interesting mechanics and surprises. Took about 3.5 hours for four of us to get through the scenario (took three tries, but I think that's the norm for this game). The art is very pretty, and there were some interesting story twists and turns as you go along; sometimes you will replay a scenario, doing something slightly different, and realize that the outcome is RADICALLY different than what you did before! This doesn't mean there is really any replay to the game once you finish it, but it does make the game a lot more enjoyable while going through it.

There were a couple of negatives that prevent this from getting a higher rating from me. First of all, the rules can be a bit cumbersome to fully understand on a first playthrough. The game does a good job of naturally guiding you, but there were still many times where we had to stop and consult the rulebook. Sometimes we couldn't find a clear answer. It's also hard at times to keep track of everything, especially when playing with the max number of players; sometimes we would forget if we had moved the TU track down by one before taking our actions. I also found the story a bit hard to follow - I would chalk this one up to our group not fully discussing everything and making note of all the subtle hints/clues that were made toward locations/characters. On subsequent scenarios I would definitely slow down and add more discussion to the game before making decisions and moving on. The  biggest issue I had with the game is the layout of it. To truly have an excellent experience you need a BIG table in order to fully have all the chits/tokens/cards spread out. The ideal way to play is to have all of the room "mini decks" separated so if you need to switch rooms it's easy to find and change the room. If you don't have the space to keep everything separated, you need to keep all the room cards in a single stack. This means every time you want to go to another room, you need to search through the deck to remove the necessary cards. This can get extremely time-consuming and cumbersome once you get near the end and find yourself going back and forth between rooms quite often.

Overally, a very enjoyable experience, but a few minor issues that prevented me from REALLY liking it. I hope to play another scenario soon and hopefully that will influence my overall rating.

The game's "play once and done" design makes it absurdly expensive compared to comparable board game experiences.

TIME Stories is a cool experience. I love the exploration aspect when trying a new scenario for the first time. But I hate the grinding nature of the last run(s) when you have figured everything out and just need to make it to the end and the actual mechanisms of the game are not particularly exciting for me either. The game's strong suit is the narrative it creates and that is good enough to make it worthwile.

Positives: was missing a piece and they sent it right out to me and the art for the game is very nice - both for the board, and the cards. Because it's a modular system they could make some very good stories with this - I'm just not willing to sift through the chaff  to find the gem.

Rating do not reflect standard rating since this can be played only one time.

It's a glorified Gamebook, so if you liked them, chances are you'll like also this.
Art is fantastic, but can't understand some design choices 
Why a fighting character has more chances to hurt himself in combat than another one? 
Or why the 80 years old is mostly immune during combat?
Or why do we need to roll a die when changing rooms and not just spend 2 TU?

But all in all the game is good, much more focused on exploration than roleplaying and i would definitely play another module

If you expect too much, u might get disappointed.
Overall decent components.
If you are familiar with PC adventure games this is decent.

My only complain is that a game which you can play only once should reward exploration, not punish it.
Thematically it makes sense, as you are in a race against time, so the faster you find the solution the better. That however means you'll skip content of the game.

Best play through experience should be with 2 runs.
1st) Try to beat the game as fast as possible
2nd) Check out all the content

I ordered the expansion in the hopes that it will add value to the base game experience.

Also i think they should release printable stories to increase the value of the game.

The argument: "It's cheaper than going to the movies with your friends" is not valid.
A lot of things are cheaper that you can do with your friends for the same amount of time.
When you are comparing something, you should compare it with a similar experience.

The game requires more and shorter stories.
So every time you play it, it will be like a new experience.

If the story is the same, you want to finish it on 1 playthrough as you are anxious to find what's going to happen in the end.
At one point it becomes tedious if the story takes too long (over 3 hours) and you simply don't care much and want to finish it.

If I heard correctly, they are to release expansions quarterly.  I also understand that there will also be fan-made scenarios, so I will also look forward to hopefully playing some creative, quality homebrew.  :-)  Yet another game from 2015 that I am giving a perfect 10 score to.

We tried it for an hour at a game cafe and found the concept intriuging. I bought it a few weeks later hoping it would be a good together game for my wife and me. However, while we found the concept interesting, the creepy story thread that developed is definitely not for us. In addition, we felt the misdirection and dead ends added more time to the game than was necessary. We finally just opened all the locations/decks to see the ending. We won't play it again or get any expansions. I'll sell or trade it soon. 1/14/18

RATING: 2
This might be the most disappointing game I have played in a very long time. The only reason I don't give it a 1 is because I need to maintain Fairytale Games  and age of steam as the two worst games I have ever played.

The rulebook is awful. The fact that there needs to be such a large "unofficial" FAQ on BGG is always a bad sign. Many rules are left unclear.

The game seemed devoid of many meaningful choices. Granted, a player could foolishly get sidetracked by meaningless actions such as freeing a guy who is only going to attack you or dancing around a plunger. However, ultimately, avoiding these side-tracked situations is little more than luck as it is difficult or impossible to determine what random interactions are going to provide you with something material and what are going to be a waste of time. This ultimately leaves the game feeling hollow and a players choices meaningless. I would question whether this could even be called a "game" at all. It may be called a "puzzle", but the clues were so scarce and obvious (once found) to leave little guess as to what they meant or how to use them, ultimately leaving little challenge to the "game"

Lastly, for such a thematic game, the story seemed very shallow and not all that impressive. 

Bad mechanics + bad story + bad rulebook/rules + praise and excitement on BGG = immense disappointment

The way the game is, in essence, is a choose your own adventure type game.

The first scenario was unlike anything I'd ever played. It was a choose your own adventure with gothic horror elements, and it was really fun. However, each scenario after that seemed to get worse and worse until we completely stopped playing it. The idea is great on paper but the time units mechanic and steps for each turn are really fiddly. The majority of challenges or puzzles rely on dice rolls which is the sole determining factor in whether you do well or not. It can be really frustrating doing everything right but not having a roll go your way. Coming so far only to fail a scenario and having to start all over is a complete drag and makes me not want to play again when that happens. The game really needs a checkpoint system so you don't have to start from the beginning. There were some interesting elements and puzzles, but those are few and far between in each scenario. Not enough to keep me coming back.

Artwork is gorgeous. Solving the puzzley nature of the packed-in scenario requires everyone on your team to be very attentive to detail. Leads to a cool "aha" moment of realization where it all clicks into place for someone. Not replayable. Too lucky for my tastes, but a cool idea.

This game was a fantastic one-off to play through! I do see why they say the replayability was low, but I had a BLAST playing this. Innovative puzzle mechanics and some built in time wasting tasks really made this one fun to go through.

What a brilliant game! The game mechanics feel both new and fresh and the first module, 'Asylum', is simply awesome. Lots of exciting moments and some very funny situations as well.
This game is one of a kind and I urge everyone to try it out - especially if you like a good story. Please, don't write the game off just because you're not into the theme of 'Asylum' - one of the other modules might interest you more and like I said, this is truly a great game.

What a weird experience. Looks gorgeous, interesting idea. Gameplay gets repetitive quickly. And the puzzle at the end was just "WTF?". I lost interest when we ran out of time on the last run through. Catsnmaths struggled with the final puzzle before just reading all the cards to see what happened. Hugely unsatisfying.

Some scenarios are much better than others. I'm looking at you Prophecy of Dragons. Unfortunately, there is very little replay value on these. Once you solve the case you're done. Nothing wrong with that. I love playing Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. However each Time Stories expansion runs around $25-30. I would much rather use that money towards buying a board game that gives unlimited replay value.

First two runs of the Asylum scenario have been fantastic.

Finally played Marcy Case. Again just brilliant, and so different from the Asylum case from the base game.

One player hated the 'Groundhog Day' syndrome; he liked the first time through, but was disinterested in subsequent runs. I did not feel like that in the slightest, but it is a valid point, if you're considering the game.

After playing the first case, this is a solid game and a great experience, but it did leave me with a  "is that it? " feeling.

Great game and once you solve the mystery there is a great sense of accomplishment. Unfortunately you can only solve it once, there after you know everything which is the only minus point in the game for me, aside from half written rule book. You can however play it through with different groups and just see them discover everything again. If the modules was replayable, rating would have been a nine, as this is an awesome experience to go through. Update: Rules for the new modules are very bad and the need for frequent reffering to FAQ's takes me completely out of the game. Update: The more modules I play, the more the system drops for me.

Played:

A Prophecy of Dragons  [2 runs]: OK, but a bit long. Glad we completed on second run - would not have wanted a 3rd attempt.

Expedition: Endurance [3 runs]: Probably enjoyed more than Dragons. Used the 'time travel' theme better.

Under The Mask [3 runs]: OK but not thrilling. Easy enough way to spend a few hours with a couple of friends.

Disclaimer: I am not sure what I am going to say will spoil the game or not, so read at your own discretion.

I will admit that this game has an interesting theme and mechanic. Going back in time, inhabiting a body and then using that person to prevent certain things from happening is pretty cool. The time unit thing is also new to me in board gaming. You might be given a choice to do something that costs more time units than another action, but will it be worth it? It's definitely part of the mystery of the game and I can see how future modules could be very challenging. Also, there are puzzles and they arent easy but arent hard either which I found cool at first, then annoying later.

Time for my critiques.The game has several stark flaws to me. 1- the result of your success is not clearly stated until the end of the run or game.Specifically, you arent told until you fail the 3rd run that your progress will affect other future games as well. Thats a bad thing because in the 3rd run it appears you have unlimited time. Thats not true and you dont find that out until you complete the game. If told before, that would completely change the run and force you to have a more conservative mindset. 2- During gameplay, you arent supposed to read the card aloud, but instead give a summary or description of the card, but on the 3rd run players are basically just reading and showing the cards because it appears there is unlimited time, so everyone would be able to see it or read it anyway. 3- The story is cool to start - almost lovecraftian, but as the game progresses the stories theme fades away and your just trying to feel your way to a rather anti-climactic ending. The game does have a lot of dead ends and red herrings which is OK, but as I stated before if you dont know the potential consequences of your actions before, those misdirections dont mean anything.

All in All, would I play this game with a different module? Probably. Would I recommend this game? Not to everyone. If you are familiar with the legacy line of games or some of the other dark coops like the Arkham Horror series and like them, then I would.

4 players. After 2 plays I am disheartened by the lack of progress and puzzle element. It felt like we were just starting to get to the puzzle when we ran out of time. Requiring players to keep restarting until they achieve the optimal sequence is very poor. Also we didn't realise we were meant to lose and should have been noting what to do where.

The fights were pointless and dull and only served to waste time and force a decision.

It's like an Escape Room you have no chance of winning after 1 play and in fact, may not have won after 3 or 4.

Feels like it should be a convoluted solo game and as my dad pointed out its a board game version of an adventure book.

The first two scenarios were fantastic. Easily a 9 or 10 out of 10. Oozing with theme and tons of fun to play through and discover the mysteries. Perhaps our group just overloaded on this game, but when it came to playing the 3rd and 4th scenarios, it just started to feel really bland and samesy. At this point I'm not really motivated to play it anymore, but since the first two plays were SO enjoyable, I'll average it out to a 7/10.

It is a one and done kinda game, taking the cost out of it.. it's fantastic.  It has some Cthulhu features and an interesting story.  It can feature all sorts of backgrounds.  My husband and I play it for date nights as we can stop it quickly if there is a problem or if we're just done.  We played through it quickly in 3.5 hours.  Both quite thrilled with the experience.  Played as with 2 character charts easily without making it clunky as some games who "try" to have 2 characters to make it a 2 player game.  Very detective, but low key.  In the end it seemed really hard to fully fail.  It does have a bit of a puzzle sequence my husband threw up his hands and didn't want to solve it.  But we did pretty quickly.  If taking notes, puzzles, detective mystery doesn't do it for you then pass.

This is an awesome game to play.  The problem is you can  only play a mission once. You might be able to play it a second time as a gamemaster when guiding others. But you know the tricks, the hints and clues. So it won't be the same. There isn't really a rating for that. I would recommend playing the fan made missions as well to get rid of the steep price though. Some of them are awesome :)

RATING: N/A
Love, love, [i]love[/i] the concept, and some plays have been awesome, [i]but[/i] the game has also delivered an unacceptably high number of failures, where players know they've missed something but no longer care enough to slog through another hour of busy-work to figure out what it was.

So far I have played or been a spectator in the following:
- Asylum: I thought it was great; the other two players were really frustrated by the main puzzle.
- Asylum: group was frustrated, needed help on the main puzzle despite taking extensive notes.
- Marcy: after two wrong guesses (we were [i]sure[/i] we were right the second time), we gave up in frustration & read through the cards to figure out what we'd missed.
- Marcy: succeeded, I guess, but players felt sort of cheated.
- Prophecy: we were hyper-focused on the mission the whole time (no "well, we haven't been there yet, so let's see what's there"), and had a great time.
- Mask: gave up in frustration, flipped all the cards, realized we'd missed one critical line of text on one card.

So, my feelings on the scenarios:
- Asylum: I love it, but may be the only one of the 7 people I've seen play it who feels that way.
- Marcy: weak; doesn't make sense, not satisfying.
- Prophecy: tense, frantic, kick-ass.
- Mask: don't know, as our one play was wrecked by a simple error.

Anyway, four or five games out of six ending with demoralized, unhappy players... that's a pretty bad ratio.

I totally enjoyed T.I.M.E. Stories and I will probably play some of the expansions. Unfortunately the game has almost no replay value, since after the first playthrough you pretty much know everything about the case at hand.

I really really want to love T.I.M.E. Stories.

Both times when I've started a new scenario, there is an incredible sense of anticipation and excitement as you are exploring new locations and trying to figure out what is going on.

However, I think it suffers as a story driven game when it clings too tightly to its win loss conditions. I am forced to leave role playing aside and just puzzle it out.

There are some wonderful aspects to it, but I feel like they have so much more potential that they haven't touched on yet.

RATING: 9
The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.

T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of "decksploration". Each player is free to give their character as deep a "role" as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.

RATING: 9
I like the choose-your-own-adventure approach for this game, and the designers were clever with how you "remember" some things when there is a time reset.  The artwork and theming is solid and consistent from scenario to scenario, and the "save" mechanism is really clever, and there is some carry-over into the next scenario, which I thought was well handled as well.  A few things that keep me from giving this a 10:

- Scenarios: we've played the first 3 scenarios, and frankly the quality of the story and implementation of the mechanics are pretty variable.  
- Resets: I get the reset mechanic, I really do - it's a real choice to make near a reset to focus on the current path or try to gather as much information on other locations before the reset.  The frustrating thing for me is the implication that you can complete the quest before the first (or second) reset.  It's possible, but you'd have to guess the path with a Karnak level of prescience to do it.  Which brings me to:
- Missing paths: it's possible to complete a scenario and never see half the deck in the scenario.  It seems a shame, and a missed opportunity - the game really pushes you (thematically) towards speed-runs, which may mean you never really get to explore the story fully.  
- Dice:  Painted wooden dice.  Really?

Overall, a really good game that, with a few tweaks, could be a legend.

Interesting game that reminds me most of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective but is a bit more of a "game" than that.  The "time" theme allows for varied adventures but is not a particularly big hook for me.  I like the atmosphere of the mysteries as much as the logic puzzles that the game presents.  I find that making multiple runs at the same scenario is a bit of a drag with each run increasing efficiency but removing me from the interesting immersive mystery of the mission.  I think I would prefer to play the missions through once each.

My group that played Pandemic Legacy through and enjoyed it has been continuing to do similar things. We moved on to Robinson Crusoe next, and last night we tackled TIME Stories. 

It's a perfect experience for our group. The setting was immersive, the gameplay was fun and challenging, and we were terrible. We fell for every red herring and distraction. Our final score was barely positive. But we had a lot of fun!

The production values for this are great, as well as just how the game is put together. We were a little frustrated by one poorly worded item, but one of us figured it out and afterwards we were able to see how we were supposed to interpret it (though it was still poorly worded.) 

The pricing structure on the game is a bit off, but we're still interested in doing other scenarios!

I was very pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed TIME Stories, or at least how much I enjoyed the case that's included with the base game (in fact, I think it is tied for the greatest disparity ever of my predicted and actual rating, 5.5 vs. 8). I had heard a lot of people say there isn't really any strategy in this game, and while besides solving the riddles and one puzzle that is basically true, it still is fun to gradually unveil what is going on. It really does like a point and click computer game, but the advantage of it being in board game form is you can share the experience with others, and the slower pace makes you feel more immersed in the world. 

Basically you'll encounter a lot of things, and it is up to you to piece together what is important to go after based on what are clues and what are false leads. Note to win this game in your first couple of attempts simply trying everything to eliminate false leads will take too much time.

Note that there isn't any obvious prompt of what you are using the answer to the riddle for.

As you go form attempt to attempt, the gradual progression of new things really creates a sense of progression in the game. On the other hand, the increasing redundancy as you play more and more times causes there to be a critical point where to maintain our enjoyment we just pretended we had infinite remaining time (though I would not recommend doing this right off the bat, because your second attempt at least your approach will probably be significantly different than from your first).

The skill check mechanism in this game is pretty mediocre. While many games have similar systems, this one is not only not particularly interesting but can take a long while to do.

I really don't like how this game decides if you win or lose (maybe there is a clue my group missed that would have mitigated this if we had understood it, but I feel like you can still do fairly well and still be forced to a loss easily). Luckily this game definitely seems to stress more of the experience rather than winning or losing.

I'm not sure how balanced the characters are, some definitely felt more useful than others.

I really don't think playing this game over multiple sessions works. A lot of the benefit you get on future runs of the game is figuring out where not to go in the future or what order to do things,and those benefits would be forgotten if played over multiple sessions.

Enjoyed the futuristic/time-travel theme, the story-telling aspects and deck building.It's also a gorgeous game.

It's a nice experience and I liked Asylum with the puzzles that were involved there, but didn't like Marcy case as much as that was too straight forward for my taste. 
But if you play a game for a story, go for RPGs as they really offer open ended stories that you can influence and a good GM will tailor it to your tastes. If you can borrow that game, it's still worth a play.

RATING: 8
This game in reality, is essentially a legacy game; or at the very least falls into that category. However, the number of plays is even more limited.

That being said, I think the way you explore the game space is fantastic, and the "universes" you explore makes each module feel quite different. You never know what's coming, even if you're experienced with previous modules.

Of course, for some, the down side will be replay-ability. Much like a good book, once you've gone through it all, you know how the story goes. Fortunately, you could realistically revisit the scenarios after enough time has passed, and in some cases, right away to see if you can perform better (as there are often multiple paths to the end).

In all, we will certainly play through all of the offerings Time Stories eventually offers.

Type: 4 player cooperative exploration mystery game

Best with: 4
weight: medium
Duration: 3-5 hours for scenario
Notes: 
requires some patience with problem solving and exploration
dice-based combat
only one real play-thru per player (mystery and puzzles solved)
board/tableau exploration
performance scored based on time spent solving the mystery

Absolutely amazing experience exploring strange places, solving puzzles, and unraveling a mystery (including dead ends). The biggest downside to this game is the lack of replay once you know the answers, though you could at least proctor new players through their own runthru (just helping with mechanics/rules and not actually playing). Also, playing through this game probably will take 3-4 hours (or more for a first run), meaning possibly two different game nights. This means taking notes is probably in our best interest, but it feels a little wrong to be able to write so much down (and you learn quickly to jot everything down!). Still, the experience is super worth it and a very unique experience in board gaming. Looking forward to continued missions/expansions!

Jeu de société / Jeu de rôle / OLNI / scénarios

Système de scénarios en forme de decks, que l'on rejoue plusieurs fois avant d'en arriver à terme.
La résolution des conflit se fait grasse à des dés, plus ou moins hasardeux selon le personnage qui entreprend l'action.
Vrai jeu coopératif narratif, supporté par de magnifiques illustrations et des histoires qui ne se ressemblent pas.
Un jeu terriblement excitant qui sait se renouveler.

Je n'ai fait qu'une partie du premier scénario (celui de la boîte de base).
C'est clairement du jeu de rôle dans lequel le maître de jeu a été remplacé par le système de jeu. On n'est pas très libre de ce qu'on fait, puisque tout est prévu de bout en bout (y compris les diverses fin, réussies ou avec échec).
On passe à mon avis trop de temps à lire des cartes, et finalement pas assez à réellement "jouer".
Concernant les règles, elles sont trop approximatives ou nébuleuses sur certains points. Les vrais jeux de rôles n'ont pas toujours des règles ultra travaillées, mais c'est le boulot du maître de jeu de faire des choix pour rendre les parties jouables par ses joueurs. Ce n'est jamais aux joueurs de se prendre la tête pour palier les flous et/ou trous des règles , ce qui est malheureusement un peu le cas ici par moment.
Bref, je me suis ennuyé, et je ne finirai jamais ce premier scénar.

I am rather conflicted about commenting on this game.  My wife and I played this with another couple.  I avoided content spoilers aggressively for MONTHS to keep the puzzles and content secret.  We finally played this weekend and all of us loved the puzzles and mechanisms of gameplay, and we were excited about the choices we made and tension from danger and figuring out the clues. So, for gameplay I would rate this a 9.  

Having said that, we all found the theme too dark and gruesome.  I felt like a bait and switch was pulled as to how this game was marketed and what the thematic content involved.  I would never play this with my children and would rate this 16+ at least.  We finished our first run and decided to stop because of the content.  Thematic bait and switch rating 3.

Having said THAT, we all agreed to try further episodes hoping they will not contain such a dark theme.

The game was fun.  The last puzzle was a lot harder then the rest of the game, so it went from really easy to really hard which made the hard part even harder.  The set up instructions were poorly done, and we had to go online to see how to set up the game.

A choose your own adventure book turned into a thematic and overproduced table top "game."  The concept is novel and I'm impressed with the amount of thought put into this idea and for that I applaud it.  It definitely tried to do something different and that intrigued me.  Sadly, the last few times I played it I could not help being bored.  Thoroughly bored.  Sigh.

I LOVE this game.  The entire idea and structure is so good and I love that the theme and even a lot of the structure can change so dramatically from scenario to scenario. The art in the packaged scenario is great and the gameplay is amazing.  Although one of the puzzles was VERY difficult we were able to figure it out without help on our third run.  So challenging enough.

My only criticism is that on subsequent runs you feel like your just pushing through to where you left off.  I know this is how it works and it's a minor complaint, but it would be fun if you could almost pick back up at a later state in the game.  Almost like a save point in a video game.

HIGHLY recommended, can't wait to play all the other modules.

RATING: 7
TIME Stories is a cardboard rendition of the classic PC adventure games from the late 80s and early 90s. On the board game scene, the game offers a new and brilliant solution to the co-op (alpha) problem. The personalized information (i.e. I know something, and I am allowed to tell, but only in my own words) creates an immersive and socially vibrating experience. 

The character, skill and dice system leave a little to be wished for though, and the artwork seems schizophrenically stuck midway between realism and a darker comic book style.

This is one of those games that offers something truly new and pushes the boundaries. It is a must for anyone interested in storytelling.

A mix of story telling like Agents of SMERSH and skill resolution like Descent, TIME Stories uses simple mechanics for a very immersive experience. Players need to resolve puzzles, investigate and understand the best and quickest way to complete each mission. The game only comes with one scenario but it is highly entertaining.

The Asyum N.T. 1921 scenario is great. Gloomy, dark, very immersive. It's a great scenario to start. A mix of fighting with long term clue gathering and the eventual puzzle resolution is extremely satisfying.

Great Co-Op, Puzzle, Write your own adventure game.  As one of the players said, reminds a bit of Myst.  Asylum had very good production values and it was easy to roleplay and be immersed in the setting.  I believe that it has to be played in small bites, instead of one binge, to savor it while everyone is fresh.  Looking forward to trying the next T.I.M.E. adventure.

Well, my first impression was very good. But then I realized that you are supposed to replay this game (for the most people) three times in order to solve the mystery. on your first try this game is very thematic and immersive. the story and theme really shines trough. however, playing a second and third time definitely kills the mood. the third run also sets the game in a loop, so you have unlimited time to solve it (obviously the designers realized that playing it more often is an absolute no-go). and the puzzle is fairly difficult, I'd say. so anyone who hates solving puzzles should not play this game.

Did not live up to the hype at all. Myself and the group were very excited to get this to the table, and it really fell flat. There are several reasons for this, the first is that for a fairly straight forward game, the rules are messy. This in itself is not a real problem, however, you have no room for error as you do not want to spoil the game for yourself and a miss play.
Second, there is no real deduction. It is guess work at best, and it all leads to a jumbled mess of a game that felt like we were just spinning our wheels. 
Third, the story did not flow nicely. For a game that is supposed to be about experience of playing, it did nothing. The theme should of drawn us in, but it felt pasted on and did not produce a smooth story that flowed from room to room. Rather, it felt like watching an internet video on 56k modem, choppy and unrefined. 
 A boring railroad where every decision you make is worthless and the entire evening is ruled out as a waste of time - 1/10

I have the first expansion but it will not be played

Very well-designed system that beautifully conveys the time travel theme.  It takes about 4-6 hours to complete a scenario, over the course of up to 3 plays per case.  Very engrossing -- not quite at the level of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, but close.  It mimics the experience of Myst or King's Quest, but is not able to achieve the same kind of depth.  On the other hand, it transforms these solitary experiences into a face-to-face social activity.

For the game as written, 7; for the potential that this system has: 9.

While the execution of the game is ultimately flawed and fairly rocky, with many rules being fiddly or detracting from the flow of the game (in particular, the Time Units rules put too much focus on getting a perfect run to enjoy exploring the setting and immersing yourself in the story) - with some tweaks, this can be a truly extraordinary gaming system, and something that I could enjoy buying and playing through scenarios for for years to come.  However, this game will live or die on the scenarios and the atmosphere that they are able to evoke.

RATING: 2
Extremely difficult to rate. On one hand, this game is, by itself, not horrendously put together. The presentation is nice and the mechanics work fine, although on occasion it is a little unclear as to how certain rules work. But nothing too bad on that front.

The issue is that it is unforgivably overpriced for what you get, and there is absolutely zero reason to ever replay it. The most amount of sessions you are able to get out of the core mission is 3. And that's by design. The whole concept of the game is exploration and discovery, but the game punishes you for doing just that, and if you have spent too much time exploring (as you are want to do since you spent $60 on the damn thing) on the third attempt it literally pushes the "Just Go Till You Win" button and makes it so that the third run will be the final time you'll ever play this game. And then it yells at you if you still took too long. Kind of like, "Thanks for spending $60, dumbass. Now get out of here and don't come back."

Any fun me and my friends had in the 4 hours it took for us to beat the entire thing was pretty much strictly due to us being friends, and had little to do with the game itself, apart from the cannibal girl eating literally everyone on the final run, which was a source of much entertainment. But that was because of us, not the game.

Do NOT buy this game unless you all chip in as a group, and each person spends NO MORE than the price of a movie ticket. I'd say that is a reasonable price as opposed to the criminally high $60 they charge for a deck of some 120 cards. Then you have a nice heavy paperweight afterwards.

I had to rate this game high so I gave it a 9 despite the fact I can only play the base game once. If I could play the base game mission over and over again with the same feelings of the initial play through I would but alas it's impossible. However, if a thousand more new missions were released I would go out of my way to play each and every one of them. 

I enjoyed the exploration aspect of the game and the twists and turns as the story progressed. It was enjoyable when my particular character who has their quirks happens to meet someone who is aware of such quirks *sniff sniff*
It was such an enjoyable experience and everyone who played it with me immediately put this game in their Top 5 of favourite games.

It may not be for everyone as there are PUZZLEs that needs to be solved that may not be for everyone's tastes.

-Managing time units is a chore
-Completion is unsatisfying
-Dice resolution is bland
-Very long for what it is and not worth $50 plus expansions for single use gameplay

T.I.M.E Stories truly is an unique experience which you'll absolutely have to play if you're into story driven games. It has the same intense moments and immersion as Mansions of Madness without the same fiddlyness and every player gets the best part of the game as there's no GM (Keeper).
You really shouldn't think too much about the price as the game is definitely worth the money you pay for the time and fun you'll get in return.
I have only one major caveat which prevents this from being a 10 game for me. I really think rolling the "time die" when moving from a location to another is unnecessary random factor and can ruin a run without a good reason. We rolled 3TU's five times in a row which is an extra 10TU's from the 25 we started with and totally ruined the run.

RATING: 6.5
I've played every scenario released so far, including the most recent Estrella Drive.  Unfortunately, my experience with Estrella Drive has dropped my overall rating from an 8.5 to a 6.5.  Let me be clear: there was no need for this scenario to be rated M.  Drugs, violence, and a naked woman laying on her stomach.  No more drugs than in Asylum, no more violence than in The Marcy Case, and no more nudity, I would say, than Asylum.

In fact, I'd say there was no reason for Estrella Drive to exist in the first place.  Of course, we don't know what will come in the story moving forward.  But Estrella Drive contributed nothing to the story save one reference to The Prophecy of Dragons, and another reference to the Elois existing.  No explanations for either, they're total Easter eggs.  No QR codes, no reference to the choice you made in Lumen Fidei, no branching story at all.  

The rating was unnecessary, which I explain below with a spoiler tag.  In general, I get the feeling that these creators  want to be ~edgy~ for the sake of it.  We saw it in Asylum, and we see it here, in Estrella Drive, with a racist caricature of a character, and unnecessary nudity.  I came into Estrella Drive fully expecting a literal sex party, or something of the like.  I'm not against inclusions of nudity when they advance the story, or when they're necessary to convey some larger point.  This entire episode felt like filler.  The person I play with commented that because not everyone will play a scenario marked "mature", they couldn't include anything lore driven.  We both agree that that's really shitty, since the nudity and therefore the rating were unnecessary in the first place.  Waste of time.  Save your money on Estrella Drive.  

The game otherwise is relatively nice.  It's RPG-lite, and requires playing close attention to playthroughs, as well as constant communication.  But it's a nice thematic game with an interesting developing storyline.  I only wish Estrella Drive didn't drop that on its head.

SLIGHT SPOILER TERRITORY RE: THE NUDITY IN ESTRELLA DRIVE

The character who is naked is the wife of a film producer.  We're told early on that he likes dating younger women, so we expect he just married this character because she's pretty.  I expect we're supposed to be taken aback when we learn he really loves her, but then the only time you interact with this character is the time she's naked outside.  This wouldn't matter to me, except that you gain nothing from interacting with her at all.  It's a complete throwaway scene.  Which means that immediately after establishing this character as not just a pretty face, the writer puts in a time-wasting unnecessary engagement with her that tells you nothing but "she's very pretty and she's drunk or high".  Unnecessary, and the only reason I can think of for why the game was rated M.

We didn't finished the Asylum mission yet, however the game play is quite unique. I also like the idea of board as console for different games (or game books), I also like the idea of possibility to create your own game.... its like an open source board game, which can lead to any adventure you want. Its very promising...just time will tell. However its very innovative concept. Interesting mechanics and very easy rules, makes this game accessible even to non-regular players, but is still interesting for players who expect something more complex. Also the Asylum is very strong story with nice horror atmosphere.

Whoa! Can't describe it by comparing it to any other board game because it is fundamentally UNlike any other board game. 

It's a legacy co-op game with save points like a video game, hidden clues like a Nancy Drew novel, and a literally limitless range of theme/s. I love how Space Cowboys not only allows but actively encourages fan-made PnP expansions. :) Think of this more like an Xbox, as a platform for games, rather than like an actual game.

A really interesting and fun game, balanced even for 2 players. It is a cooperation, not a competition game, so players try to work together. Illustrations are really nice, storyline immersing, gameplay really interesting and unique. Also has potential for future content - new missions are being released, changing pretty much everything, leaving just mechanics of gameplay. There are 2 main drawbacks: 1. replayability is really bad, you just complete a scenario and that's it. It's like reading a book - you may re-read it discovering new stuff but in the end you know the main things. 2. Dice rolling mechanism feels like a hinder. Even though it's nice idea, but failure rate is kinda too high. I'd say add one more star on a dice instead of a blank. Overall highly recommended, if you're willing to spend money (preferably several people spending) for additional scenarios. Don't buy it if you're not willing to spend extra on expansions.

I was given this huge box for my birthday by my daughters. Although not being a great fan of this kind of storytelling boardgames, we decided to play it immediately. I must confess the smoothness of the box and components was an immedate pleasure. At first sight, the rules seemed a bit bulky, but after managing the first couple of rounds all maked sense and started to run intuitively. The scenario is well designed, and one starts to feel involved as the accompanying graphics are a delight, especially the card made scenes. After the first half hour of play and exploring three locations, we were captured by the plot and enjoyed every minute of the three hours we spent around the well conceived architecture of the whole concept. The first impressions where frankly positive, although I am a bit aprehensive about replayability, as we managed to discover a great part of the locations and script... Seven out of ten for starters. I'll review this rating after two or three replays.

AMAZING story and great implementation of the old school "point and click" detective story games.  Puzzles were interesting and game play was fairly streamlined.  I wish there was more buildup to the ending, and that the game had a denouement instead of just ending abruptly.

Replayability is almost non-existent.

Will definitely be buying expansions.  This should say a lot about how fun the game is.

RATING: 9.9
2nd best game of 2015. 
We have choose your own adventure books to explore on your own. We have Descent/Imperial Assault that brought roleplaying elements to bordgames (DM vs. others and a story). Pathfinder ACG streamlined and removed DM, took dull aspects of roleplaying and made a dull boardgame of them. TIME Stories streamlined, removed DM, but instead took fun aspects of roleplaying and made a fun boardgame of them. Small minus for pricing (Pandemic Legacy has more content for same price as TIME Stories + two decks, TIME Stories has way better story and no component destruction, hmm), otherwise golden.

Réussit assez bien à lier système (un peu) et narration (beaucoup, avec de vraies histoires et pas des événements random).
Malgré tout ce n'est pas rejouable, un peu random (justifiant la mécanique de boucle qui peut être aussi pénible par moment) et dépend beaucoup de la qualité des scénarios.

After a lot of reviews from podcasters and youtubers convinced us to get T.I.M.E. Stories, we played through the Asylum mission that comes with the game. The mechanism to force a few play-throughs makes sense thematically and was interesting, but the dice based combat and time-tracker made everything unnecessarily challenging in an uninteresting way. The 2 main dice-based parts of the game pulled us out of the story and made for a frustrating experience.

We really loved the idea and the potential of expansions, and we might try an expansion some day, but this was one of our first modern board games and remains one of our bigger disappointments :/

I completely understand why the concept of a game that can only be played once would put a lot of players off, but by not trying this you are missing out on one of the most original and engaging game experiences in a long time. The story telling, puzzle solving and team work are all on point and the overall aesthetic has a nice clean sci-fi feel to it. Works well with all player counts and can be enjoyed by non-gamers to an extent.

I consider TIME stories to be an "analog video game console" or an elaborate "choose your own adventure" book.  The episodes have been fun enough, but because the scenarios are fixed there's no replayability at all once you complete an episode, and the price point of subsequent episodes feels not a worthy investment.  I like playing, but i would never buy.

Interesting story telling game, but the time mechanic makes it so you can't explore the story much, and there doesn't seem to be much investigative strategy...it seems that you stumble on what you need or you don't.  I've only played the one scenario the game comes with (twice, failed both), so I may have missed something with it, whether just not solving the puzzle, or if the other content is better.  I'll eventually play again and finish the first scenario and check out others.

The game play is interesting and the game is beautiful.  I do love the saving game feature!

A friend bought this and we played through the base game three times (it took 3 plays to get to the end). It was really enjoyable, I'm glad that someone else bought it though, as this is a one off game. Much like a murder mystery, once you know the mystery, you can't really play it again.

Playing through the Marcy case it was good fun and an interesting idea but running through three runs in about a day and a half of gaming probably is what killed it for me.  The nature of the puzzles on that one were just not up my alley. Perhaps a different case would fix my dislike and I have heard by a few people that they enjoyed the second one much more and it was much better in terms of the type of puzzles. Maybe I'll try again one day but right now that's unlikely.

Took us three goes but we finally beat the mission.  Can't see how it could be done in one go, or with fewer players than 4, but lucky we had a full compliment and the time to do it all.

This is a multiplayer"choose-your-own-adventure" book, or a point and click adventure game that became cardboard.

The included case is very atmospheric, has at least one horribly reward free dead end, takes about 5 hours to complete and has almost no replay value. There are decisions to be made, meaningful ones even, but sometimes there are not enough clues to base them on.
 The game is very expensive considering the projected playtime, but we liked it anyway.

Remarkable. It isn't often that I experience a game that makes me rethink how games work and the pleasure I derive from them, but I've had just that experience three times in the last six months- Kingdom Death, Pandemic Legacy, and now, Time Stories. It needs an interest in roleplaying (and the use of variant with two players) but I played the base and the first expansion straight through in a single sitting.

Group did not like this game. The mission of the story was too unclear, we did not know what we were looking for or what to do to achieve the end goal of fixing temporal glitch (what?). Compounding the issue was that after each loss, you had to redo everything all over again. It quickly became repetitive and more of a chore. Not a fun time. Played 3 times, lost every time, and in the end, we flipped over all the cards to see how it ended.

Excellent new gameplay, with extended dive into narrative interests. 
The first scenario included in the base game is very good at teachnig basic stuff (how to use dice, how to explore) and some advanced techniques (as in "this really does not feel like something we are expected to do"). 
Art and components are top-notch. 
Is a bit expensive if you are not in for the long haul. 
Is disliked by many players who shy away from uncertainties.

RATING: 7
Fascinating. Plays logged under the expansion played. Really nice idea, looping and attempting the same scenario with more information is interesting. Hopefully it'll turn out well, I can see how this could go bad if solving the case takes too many attempts and is too luck-heavy even after you know all the information required.

Suggest.

Immensely engaging story-based game.  I felt you really needed to understand and embody your characters.  Without this, I think you can tend to make some "less successful" choices and fall into a point and click kind of computer adventure.  I say "less successful" because every decision leads to interesting story moments.  Finishing with a top tier score is almost a shame as you almost certainly miss some of the great moments in the game (at least with Asylum).  It will be interesting to see if each case will be as engaging as the first.  Regardless, I'm looking forward to finding out.

I have not kept this game. There is little to no replay value. Expansions are promised then pushed back on release. I don't understand why this doesn't work for me. I love Role Playing Games, Choose your own Adventure books, and solo Adventures, but this game just does not scratch any itch I have. Realize that I am not a typical player, MOST people LOVE this game. I, however, do not enjoy games that go on for 1+ hours. I love micro and filler games, or games like Epic Card Game, or Magic: The Gathering that have short rounds. I do not want to set an entire evening playing one game. Again, please read other reviews MOST people LOVE this game, but if you are like me then be warned, it is a longer version of CYOA books that is needlessly non-randomized. Don't get me wrong I don't like games that are too random but this one is not random enough. 3/10 Once was enough, not again.

Get 3 more people and split the cost of the game due to the nature of it being a "One and Done" type of game... this way it's much lighter on the pockets and since this is a group experience makes logic to do it that way... and you should do that preferably with the same group for all the expansions...

[u][b]Talking only about the "System"[/b][/u] and not the Scenario inside the Base box:

This is just an AWESOME system... and it was much more deserving of winning the Geek Award for Innovation than [b][thing=161936][/thing][/b]

This was truly innovative and creates an open system for having a constant stream of content being created for it... the possibilities are endless and I that is just fantastic.

[u][b]Regarding the Scenario[/b][/u] that comes with the System, Asylum is an heavy theme that can "scare" some people away, I loved it! AMAZING artwork and story telling...

This game oozes awesomeness and theme from every card, every chit, even the insert is simply amazing...

Great puzzles to be solved, get a pen and paper and someone needs to take good notes in each location so you can save some time when you visit them again in a future run.

Players are always engaged, trying to beat some test, deciphering puzzles, hints and clues and having those "WHAT?!?!?" and "AHA!!!moments

Love this game. Being the first, it's what made me want to play the rest, and I'm always excited when I can play another (real or fan-made). Love the puzzles, the story, and the way that each player has to relay information in their own way since you can't see the cards at someone else's location; really helps eliminate alpha-playing. Favorite co-op game by far.

I feel this game should be in the RPG-database since it is a true RPG. The game mechanism is very well developed but resembles in nothing to a standard or even derivate board-game.
The scenario included in the box provides a (long) evening of fun and entertainment with nice twists and good puzzles. And all this without a GM.

TIME stories gave me a fun and exciting evening and I am looking forward to playing the next scenario. But keep in mind that once played, a lot of the flavor is gone. As a group-buy this is however a recommended game.

RATING: 8
For me, the best story-oriented (non-RPG) board game available.  The system is an absolutely fantastic story game framework.  

The introductory scenario - 'Asylum' - is a bit weak: it lacks background and NPC character motivation. Also, many  choices lead to the same place: making players feel like they were funneled through the story. It had a few challenging puzzles and I would prefer even more puzzles. It was a memorable, amazing, scintillating experience! 

'The Marcy Case' is more action-oriented.  There are no puzzles which stop you in your tracks, but there are two key puzzles late in the game that are fun to work out.  I thought the narrative here was stronger than in Asylum. It felt like a cohesive story to me.

'A Prophecy of Dragons' starts with a weak hook, an unfocused objective, and a lack of coherence.  We found this scenario really challenging and frustrating because we were slow to pick up on how to approach this game.  Repeating the first half of the game 4 times started to make the game seem tedious.  When we got to the second half of the game, the story elements revealed were very exciting and fun - ending the scenario on a huge upswing! 

'Under the Mask' starts with a clear and concrete mission statement, making it easy to relate to the story.  There is a new mechanism and a new approach to location development which distinguishes this scenario - keeping it fresh and interesting.  Overall, however, it was a small mission without really tough battles or puzzles.  

'Expedition Endurance' is a short, easy, linear mission.  If you haven't played any of these yet, I think this should be the second mission played.  For me, it may have been the least interesting mission of those so far released.

'Lumen fidei' is a longish mission broken up into numerous sections; so that when you do have to make a re-run, you won't have to revist too man. The story is pretty well developed, and the mission has some excellent puzzles.  But the climactic scene is like all others:  I hope the next mission has a different kind of ending.

Each story has a different feel; some expansions have more fighting, puzzles, length of play, engrossing story, etc.  I have all of the current expansions, and I really enjoyed Expedition Endurance more than most game reviewers due to a story element used and mood.  Most games last 2 or 3 attempts, although The Marcy Case was the most difficult and went to a 4th for us.  We quickly go through repeat areas, so that doesn't bother me.  At times, I wish there were more on the cards.  I've heard some have issues with the rules, but at most I had to reread a card a couple of times to get it.  I really prefer legacy and story-driven games, so that is why I rate this an 8.  The dice rolls are a bit too simple; I'd actually prefer more strategy.  This is a game for 2 to 4 people, and I seem to prefer it with 2.

T.I.M.E Stories ist wohl eines der außergewöhnlichsten Brettspiele der letzten Jahre. Die Spieler schlüpfen in die Rolle von Zeitagenten, die in der Zeit zurück geschickt werden, an Orte an denen ein "Riss" in der Zeit geschlossen werden muss. T.I.M.E Stories öffnet sich damit alle Türen zu den unterschiedlichsten Szenarien, die man sich vorstellen kann. Im Grundspiel reisen die Spieler zurück in die 60/70er Jahre und in eine Irrenanstalt. Die Agenten übernehmen die Kontrolle von geisteskranken Insassen und müssen fortan versuchen, das Rätsel um die Anstalt zu lösen. T.I.M.E Stories erinnert dabei an ein PC Adventure oder alte Rollenspielbücher, simuliert das Erforschen der Umgebung aber mit Karten, die verdeckt liegen und von einem der Spieler angeschaut werden dürfen. Die Karten sind wunderschön illustiert, das restliche Spielmaterial kühl und stylish. Der große Kritikpunkt an T.I.M.E Stories ist, dass man jede Geschichte/jedes Abenteuer nur einmal (erfolgreich) absolvieren kann. Denn dann kennt man dieentsprechenden Wege und des Rätsels Lösung. Der Fakt, dass nur ein Abenteuer im Grundspiel enthalten ist, macht es nicht wirklich besser. Zwar gibt es mittlerweile 4 Erweiterungen, diese kosten aber natürlich zusätzliches Geld. T.I.M.E stories als Konzept ist fantastisch, ohne Frageund jeder ambitionierte Brettspieler sollte sich dieses Spiel einmal anschauen. Der nicht-vorhandene Wiederspielwert, verhindert aber für mich persönlich eine höhere Bewertung.

I bought this game for the storytelling. TIME Stories turned out to be great in that regard. We had a great time playing the base adventure, although the plot wasn't what I expected when I bought the game.

And then I realized that I would never, ever be able to play the adventure again. Because I already know every secret after 1 playthrough. So what's the point of owning this game? Sure you can play with a new group and they can discover everything and you sort of hang with them, but that's like playing D&D when one player already knows the adventure. Boring!

Also, what's up with the strange b-side horror movie plots? I thought this was a time travelling game, where you visit critical events in history and fight to prevent an alteration of space-time or whatever.... I don't want to spoil the plot of the adventure now, but it's not history... it's more like throwing X-Files and Lovecraft into a blender, with some time machines for garnish.

So yeah, I'm not a fan. A 50€ game that I can only play once? And for every new gaming session I have to buy a 20€ expansion? Yeah right - wait here while I light my cash on fire...

If you want to play TIME Stories, buy a used copy or borrow a copy from someone else. Or get the Cthulhu pen and paper game and enjoy endless roleplaying experiences with your friends for far less cash.

A fabulously crafted system that will be well-loved for a long time if they keep generating new content for it. So far, each scenario has been completed in a single session (about 4-4.5 hrs).
Some of the rules could've been explained a bit better - we spent our 1st run fairly confused. I would've liked to have had a training location included so that you could get to grips with the mechanics before entering a mission and worrying about the limited time.
The included Asylum 1921 was good fun and was a good introduction to the system. Was quite puzzly but we all enjoy puzzles so that was good, but I can see it being frustrating to someone who perhaps doesn't enjoy crosswords and cryptic games.

Go into it thinking of it as an event as opposed to a game. For the same price as 4 friends going out to a movie, you could spend half a day on this instead. Best experience I've ever had with a board game. Can't wait to play the expansions.

RATING: 9
Difficult to rate:
"Always wants to play it": No! Only want to play each scenario once. (Except of the fun of watching other player).
But: "Always wants to play new scenarios!" Absolutely!
Really, really great design, role-playing stuff and this feeling of not "playing" but "experiencing" the game.
Some "Whaaat?" and "oh-oh"-effects, I've never had in board games.
First cooperative game, where the aim is not really to win the game but to explore the puzzle.
*Edit: some jears later i want to add the following: It really seems the game is getting much worse, if you play everything in one run. Its getting repetitive and boring. It seems to be part of the game to struggle together to remember some stuff and to read storytexts again.

Wow, a game that loves upto the hype!
I am playing the asylum scenario and with my family (wife & daughter) and we are 2 runs in (both failed) as I write this comment. This is the first game that I have played where my family have asked to continue into the night because it is soooo immersive and gripping.
The story is incredibly well written and brings out the asylum atmosphere.
The rules have some errors that I assume are due to translation but should have been fixed before the game was released. However reading the FAQS before we started playing made the game run smoothly.
Highly recommended for players who enjoy a mystery game mixed with RPG elements.

I put off playing this for so long because I didn't think I would like it, and frankly the price point to game time is a little ridiculous. I came away enjoying myself though. This is less of a point-and-click adventure in card form, and more of a choose-your-own-adventure game. At least, that's the vibe I got. There's a central path you're supposed to take, but deciding how much time you want to devote towards searching and gathering items on the side gives it an interesting exploration feel. I'm not completely sold on this game system as a whole, but I'm at least interested in checking out another case or two to see how things unfold.

In excellent condition; some very minor shelf wear.

I feel like play is somewhat random. I can't imagine winning on the first try. No replayability, but there are frequent expansions to keep the story fresh. There are places where a bad decision can doom the game, but you don't find that out for another hour.

While I'm not the biggest fan of the game's cost/time played ratio, the game itself is a blast.  Everyone at the table was super invested in the action and we had a great time working through all of the dead ends and false leads in the story.

RATING: 5
In this cooperative game, you take on the role of someone in an asylum. You go from room to room, getting information, meeting people, and getting clues. The clock in this game is a time unit, which it costs to move to a room and take actions.  The game ends when you run out of 25 TUs, but with the knowledge gained you attempt another game. If you have lost on time in the first two games, then you start again at 30 TU and continue the game to the conclusion. 

The game can lead to multiple dead ends when solving the mystery. In addition, you really have to pay attention to the details in the pictures. That's a key to solving the mystery. It's a bit obtuse for my tastes, especially since you have to rely on pictures, and the rules aren't completely clear cut. Other people may enjoy the experience.  I tend to think linearly, so I get thrown off by pictures, and tend not to understand the end goal of these games. I heard the expansions eliminate the picture element.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not as innovative as some of the hype said but it does choose-your-own-adventure gameplay smoothly. The asylum game is well produced with some good atmosphere. Some might be frustrated by the authors' not tying up loose ends, leaving much of it untold, although I quite like that.

RATING: 7.5
A choose-your-own-adventure experience, where losing at least once and replaying with more knowledge is part of the design. It's a fun activity, and my family would like to play at least one of the expansions, but I would say it's not perfect, since re-running multiple times can get a bit tedious when you just want to get to the next interesting part. Also, while it makes sense that there should be some dead ends and false leads, it's a bit frustrating to encounter ones that are really elaborate and don't give any benefit. That said, I think it's designed about as well as it can be for the kind of experience it is.

Played this game two times and beat the first scenario. While artwork is great the mechanics are rather shallow. What I don't like about this game is that it's not about puzzles or thinking things through. It's about try and error. I don't get much satisfaction from running around aimlessly until I find usefull stuff that I can use next time I try to solve the game. Thematically it's very bad, too. You have a Serious Sci-Fi-Setting with (stupid) explanations of many game mechanics and then you start to unravel lovecraftian stuff which just doesn't fit the overall theme at all. They care to explain why you have only some time to solve a case but what's the scientific explanation of the lovecraftian stuff? Stupid story writing at it's best.

The system employed here and the freedom enabled by the one-and-done nature of the card decks leave the door open for a great design. Alas, the first two missions out of the gate are not great designs. Dice luck can arbitrarily sink a run, leading to repetition. The central puzzles are a bit too simple, especially with multiple minds working to solve them. The potential for something amazing is there, but the stories will have to move past cliches and the mechanics will have to be more seamlessly integrated for the game to get there.

Awesome stories and great puzzles make this game a must buy for me. Fortunately, this also cover some of its main failures. It's fun to have the first run ruined because you guessed something wrong, but it's not fun - at all! - to be forced to run through the game one more time, for one hour or more, because the dice were unkind to you.

An exception to this would be the fantasy adventure, as the dice rolling feels very familiar to those good D&D games of yore.

I'm sure this is a good game. However, it's just not for me. The flavour text is good, the locations are well thought out and illustrated, but the game just doesn't "grab" me. 
25 "Time Units" (action points) you start with seem to be very limited and you would have to be very lucky to pick the right actions/locations along the way and be lucky with the dice rolls to win.

I know this game is supposed to take multiple plays, but it doesn't feel like a puzzle that you can solve, except through multiple tries, which just seems to be re-watching an movie that you weren't that invested in anyway.
Nothing puzzle like in the game that made us think or have to work things out.

But the story and the ideas behind the scenarios are so much fun and the art is so amazing I'm still waiting for new scenarios.

T.I.M.E Stories is a further distillation, and great improvement, of the Mansions of Madness RPG-in-a-box concept.  You're paying for a "system" and the first story that slots into it, and there's a clear linear path that you must maximize for peak results -- it's the very definition of a "solvable" game.  The challenge in T.I.M.E Stories is unpacking the riddles and puzzles.  The early stories have some issues (notably the extreme tropey-ness and the violence-is-the-answer tendencies) but they play out better than most story-telling board games.  
 
But if the story is the thing that really, really hooks you here (and let's be clear - it is)... why are those stories so utterly fucking hack?  The first six stories are (in order): a Lovecraft cult story, a zombie tale, a medieval tale not set on Earth but that operates exactly like Earth, something in Egypt, ANOTHER Lovecraft tale, and the Knights Templar.  You have created a universe where you can travel ANYWHERE and these are the stories you're choosing to tell?  And what does that say about us?

There are simply better games that accomplish all of these things.  They're called RPGs and they're literally story games.  Just play them already.  Trust me -- you'll enjoy them much more.

That said, I have played all of the episodes to date.  I enjoy the experience.  But all I want is to run a full RPG session of Time and Temp afterwards and see what my game crew thinks.

Contains all of the worst aspects of games (obscure puzzles, memorization, co-op) and combines them into a play-once experience where once is one times too many. The whole group was so frustrated by the end that we just read the last few cards to see what happens without any care to the order or scoring. 

Bumping from a 1 to a 2. The artwork is good after all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The graphic design is good (the blue and black token colours are too similar), the components are nice, but what really stands out in this game are the illustrations. They are gorgeous and there are many of them. Each card has its own.

The game experience is close to those "Choose Your Own Adventure" books, or even some graphic adventure videogames where you have to do several things in the right order. The mechanisms are very original, they have been designed to clone this experience and to be able to follow the same paths, but with some differences. And they work.

The main issue, obviously, is the replayability. There seems to be several viable paths, but they are not different enough. You will not finish the adventure in the first playthrough, and only [i]a great performance and an equal level of luck[/i] will allow you to finish it at the second try. That means you will get to play this adventure thrice, and that's all. Maybe in some years from now, provided you don't have a very good memory...

Of course, there are expansions at your disposal, but they are pricey and they will last the same. I understand they have to pay for the great illustrations, but I cannot help but feel that those great illustrations are kind of wasted on a game that will only see table one evening.

Overall, I have enjoyed it, but I don't think the experience is worth it. Maybe it's because of my RPG background, but I didn't found it to be as immersive as they say; I found it to be more like a puzzle-like game. I was also expecting more clues and deductions out of the text readings that could lead you to the right path, but most of the times, it's just a matter of "trial and error": you try something, you fail, you remember no to do that the next time.

I don't want to spoil the story, but I will just say it was disappointing as well.

I will try again with the expansions, but for now, I think I prefer a good RPG session or even an adventure videogame with a nice story.

[No Spoilers] What a game! This was by far the best game I played at BGG CON 2015. It does what so many "narrative-driven" games fail to do. It tells a compelling story, invites you to participate, then gets out of the way. Many other, "experience," games rely on artwork or flavor text to advance the narrative. This game drives the story forward, and achieves a surprising level of immersion by simply allowing the story to speak for itself. Wonderful story-telling. Wonderful puzzle-solving. Wonderful cooperative gaming experience. It's all just wonderful. I've heard all the concerns/complaints about it being a consumable/disposable game, with little replayability. All I can say is that we're 2 runs into the base game, Asylum. If I never play the game again, the experiences I've have had with the game so far are worth the money I paid for it. Then when you consider the fact that there will be reasonably-priced expansions coming out on a somewhat regular basis (3 are already planned, with one currently available), it's a no-brainer. If you don't own this game already, do yourself a favor. Pick it up. It's fantastic.

RATING: 7
I find it tough to rate. I only played the initial scenario so far and the concept is pretty great, but if I would rate thia as the standalone game the short playtime would be quiet a disappointment. 
A lot depends on the follow-up scenarios and while there is a lot of potential to do something great, the game also has some potential flaws (discovering new interesting stuff is great, but having to go through the same things over and over again can get pretty repetitive) and I hope the scenarios will find a good way to handle those, but for now it's just wait and see. 

I also hope they find some more interesting settings for the scenarios (knowing Asylum so far and what Marcy case and also the dragon prophecy are about). The time travelling theme has so much potential on its own, which is why I really don't know why they feel the need to put certain "fictional" and fantasy stuff in there, when the time travel theme would allow to also deal with more realistic but still very interesting storylines that would be much more different from all the things already out there.

Ok, so some of the scenarios are hit or miss (individually i'd rate the ones I've done as an 8,9, and a 10)  and I imagine the game works differently in different groups.  For my group this game just clicks.  Its funny and has its own personality.

Only played the Asylum scenario so far, but based purely on that - brilliant game.  Real clever, full of good ideas.  The scenarios are one shot so if you can't reconcile yourself to that then don't go here, but so far I think this game is great.

Awesome! Click adventure game goes cardboard. Intriguing storytelling, hard puzzle solving, SF setting, great artwork, full of atmosphere, working as a full coop, mitigating alpha player problems. Forget about fiddliness, those are the kinds of games I enjoy the most.

Downsides: I wish it was more replayable. If it was, it would easily be a 9 in my book, with a perspective on a perfect 10.

Asylum case: exciting, took us 4 runs.
Marcy case: One lucky shot and you win in the second run. Felt a little arbitrary, too. Few clues, depending on where you got first, probably.

When you have a group of people who get into the story it generates a fun experience. Mechanically this design is very flawed; riddled with die rolls that determine the success of your mission and designed dead ends that exist for no other reason than to waste your time.

La historia del juego base es un cliché absoluto de las pelis de horror de serie B, una burda imitación de una aventura mediocre rollo aventurilla insustancial de La llamada de Cthulhu (con muchos elementos de la trama carentes de una explicación razonable). La mecánica de resolución de tiradas de atributo deja mucho que desear: Es casi preferible ser más bien malo en combate para lanzar menos dados y así tener menos probabilidades de obtener caras de contraataque; el resto de tiradas consiste sencillamente en invertir más tiempo (la "moneda" del juego) para resolverlas. La aventura nos la merendamos en unas 3 horas y media, por lo que la proporción precio / diversión no es muy alta teniendo en cuenta que las misiones no son rejugables. Acabamos la partida en la última localización leyendo directamente las cartas de la misma, sin avanzar el marcador de tiempo, pues ya nada nos podía importar menos. Buen intento, interesantes mecánicas ligeramente novedosas, pero mediocre ejecución y muy mejorable argumento. Para esto, me juego una partida de rol decente.

Para mi serie de citas polémicas:
"Time Stories es un Munchkin sobreproducido"  ;)
Es divertido leer los chistes, la primera vez

El juego se arruina (spoilea) desde la primera partida
En la segunda partida, la mitad de lo que hacés es ya repetitivo, y si no ganás
En la tercera partida, tres cuartas partes de lo que hacés ya lo hiciste,
y te querés matar por tener que volver a hacerlo sólo para llegar con tres o cuatro turnos más a donde llegaste la vez anterior, Y SI NO GANAS
a la mierda! te regalás tres turnos y ves cómo termina, porque ni en pedo volvés a hacer todo de nuevo
La historia está buena, el arte está bien logrado, los componentes son de buena calidad
pero este juego es cualquiera
Como houseruleo: juéguenlo 1 VEZ, sin contar el tiempo, hasta que lo resuelvan
luego lo empacan y lo venden, porque se acabó

RATING: 8.5
First rating after 4 basic games (the first one took two sessions) on 19.09: 9.1.. I love the roleplaying-aspect of the game, which reminds me of my student days. And I REALLY love the exiting twists of the first story. Definetely a keeper. I know that the basic game is used after three games (the most). But I cannot wait to play one of the expansions.

Now (as of 23.01.2017) after 4 more games we played the Dragon Prophecy (made it in one run!) and marcy case I still love the game. Just failed marcy case in the first attempt. It will stay at a solid 9.0! Btw: The Marcy-Case is the best scenario so far!

After 13 games in Aug 2017 I rate it down to a 8.5 although I loved the Behind the Mask scenario a lot.

Everyone is working cooperatively to uncover clues, talk to people for information and search new areas to solve the mystery.

You only have so many turns to achieve all this.
This game reminds me of some PC adventure games where you have to solve a puzzle to get a clue, or talk to some people to get the right information, make the right choices or end up at a dead end.
If you reach a dead end you may end up losing the game because time ran out.

The game is ok enough to play, but the multiple runs in effect make it a memory game mixed with a guessing game - you're initially choosing which location to travel to next with close to zero information. Which doesn't make for a meaningful game. And you can only play each game (and each expansion scenario) once. As re-run games go, Tragedy Looper felt tighter and your involvement more meaningful, plus it has multiple scenarios to generate repeat play. After playing this and the Marcy case, really it's just a function of gathering information over enough runs to give you the information you need to know to be able to put together one perfect run to win the game. And try not to get frustrated by stumbling over each red herring waste of time. It's shown itself to be a co-op without interesting risk-based decisions, and galvanising the group dynamic along these lines is an essential element of any successful co-op. In effect it's a paragraph game that you're playing to see what happens in the story - but with the downside of having to play the same story numerous times. Also not a great feature. It's a ride game, for the experience and the memory, but there's no great satisfaction, no meaningful decisions, and not a lot of "fun". I'm playing just to see what happens really.

Secret santa's 15 gift. We had a really great moment (4 hours and a half to be precise). The graphics are beautiful, the game's smooth. I didn't give a 10 because of the lack of consistency in the story : at the end we did'nt have the feeling of having a case, a story, which we solved. But in any case it was an outstanding experience and we'll play at least another case, no doubt about that.

This game is not for me or Kristy. We did two runs of Asylum and just agreed to be done with it after that. It is very random and a lot of the times you have no information upon which to make decisions. Neither of us got into the role playing and paraphrasing the "stories" on the cards just seemed odd. I also got annoyed about redoing things on our second run.

I have only played through the Asylum scenario so far. I played it two players. I have some complicated feelings about the game so far. I absolutely adore that it's like a point and click adventure and that there are branching paths. I love the mystery and intrigue as the story unfolds around you. I just don't really like the whole Time Units system. I think it's unfairly punishing, when there is just so little chance that you could perfectly complete a story on your first run. Why not just simply track the amount of Time Units it takes you to complete and grade you from there? It's not a perfect solution but the current system rubs me the wrong way. These sorts of games (for me at least) are the kinds that should encourage exploration and taking every path. It seems this game wants to punish you. You will note that I still rate it a nine, because while I was playing the game, I wasn't thinking about these issues. I was wrapped up in the intrigue. That's what makes a fantastic gaming session.

Game mechanics easy to pick up. Have only played Asylum. Very challenging!
Really great presentation and artwork. Theme excellent and the tone and feel are all superb.

So 4 runs into the Asylum mission my group rebelled and said TIME Stories was stupid and frustrating. We just could not find the items and solve the puzzle. Plus the time allowance was just too strict. One year later I went through the mission again by myself with the BGG guides. I still couldn't open the gate. In the end I just found the number card I needed and proceeded. I did not find it rewarding or fun at all, despite my love for the theme and concepts behind the game. To be honest that mission was frustrating and we hated it. On to the Marcy Case next and if that suck too them me and TIME stories will be parting ways.  2  out of 10

OK Marcy Case was a bit better - but still impossible to do within the time and when you revisit, it becomes a little boring because you have already been there.
5 out of 10.

Overall, I guess this game isn't for me.

I don't like cooperative games to begin with, so this game did not really have a fair chance. However, the mechanics are very pedestrian (pick a card to read and roll stars to pass a test, etc). You are supposed to be immersed in the story, but the story is chopped to pieces and far too much is left unanswered. When we finally won the base scenario, it really felt like we had done little to nothing that had anything to do with the objectives read to us at the beginning of the game. Also, too many objects are just red herrings that seem arbitrarily thrown in just to ensure you do not win on the first run through. I don't mind not winning, but I prefer a reason for failure other than the author playing random tricks on you.  So bland mechanics and a poorly constructed story equals a really bad game. I hope that as time passes, fewer people buy the expansions and all the fans just trade them back and forth. That could spell the end of this title.

T.I.M.E Stories is a cooperative puzzle-solving exploration game that can only be played through once by any given group because you'll remember the solutions. The game takes elements from the movie Groundhog Day (or the game Tragedy Looper) in that the group plays through the same scenario multiple times but can do different things each time. However, after a certain amount of time (actions) each play-through will end and you have to start over again. Many challenges (including combat) are dice-based skill checks that can take multiple turns, chewing up your available time. Some are even red herrings that serve no purpose but to waste your time. This particular scenario presented a good entry point to the system, though the theme was a bit macabre. There was one puzzle in the middle that I felt was too much of a head-scratcher. And winning or losing in the end felt a bit arbitrary. This may be one where I like the system better than the experience that the base game scenario provided.

I like the idea of what they're trying to do, but not so much the actual gameplay experience. Being set back each time, while great in principle, is kind of a pain in the ass in terms of actual gameplay.

Fantastic artwork (like really, really good) and unique and mostly interesting stories, but rather mediocre and not well thought out mechanics. It's like a lazy RPG without nearly as much narrative as an actual RPG experience would net you. I also found a lot of the freaking dice rolls annoying. Too easy to fucking die in the game when you roll like complete shit on 3 dice. Time is far too limited to spend 3 rounds in a locked combat. Not to mention random dead ends, while cool initially, grew rather frustrating when it happened on the third run through.

I also had issues with the rules. It was rather vague in certain spots and we weren't spending enough time moving and too much time when we did move to a new room. Simply stating that any time a card tells you to change locations (outside of the room you're in), you roll the time die (which might as well be spend 2 TU and not roll a fucking die since it averages out to be exactly that anyways). It would have also been very clear if it mentioned that simply being in a room and looking at cards doesn't cost time. If a card requires you to do a skill check or if you wish to look at other cards (aka move), you must spend a TU for the group to allow for various actions amongst players. Thus you may potentially be able to look at 2 cards the first time you're in a room for only 1 TU.

We didn't game the system, but I felt like it was rather easy to just split the characters and cover each panoramic picture or at least get 90% of the room explored for 1 TU. We tried to play it thematically as if our characters were in that situation, but if was artificially gimping us. Especially since random parts of the room allows you to advance further in the game.

I feel like Shut up and Sit Down's review of the game nails it exactly. It's fun for around 3 hours, but once you've gone through the scenario twice, you're basically ready for it to be over. I really feel like there needs to be more checkpoints or something to keep you from backtracking so much.

[b]VERY MINOR SPOILERS of The Asylum[/b] - So the final puzzle to the asylum story was incredibly frustrating. So much so that it partially soured my experience. It essentially broke the 4th wall and we weren't even sure we could do what it wanted us to do. I hope the second story is better, but I started to get a bit annoyed by the resetting of everything and the various dead ends. It felt like we were just rushing through the second and third time to get some permanency in the games state. Not to mention the ending was similar to Neon Genesis Evangelion. "Congratulations". :/

Concept is cool, execution is shoddy. Clues do not persist between runs, meaning you have to write down detailed descriptions of clues yourself, including entire tape transcripts or pentagrams with numerous symbols. Combat is boring and uninspired. Abilities and powers are vaguely defined (I'm looking at you, ex-marine from Marcy Case). Losing when close to the end results in the unappealing prospect of doing almost everything you just did with just one or two small differences. Base game comes with only one case. Stories enter tropes quickly. MIssion scoring makes little sense (you can get more points from purposely failing this run then blasting through next run than you could succeeding near the end of this run).

J'avais très hâte de jouer à Time STORIES et je savais que le jeu était une sorte de "Die and Retry", un scénario où vous allez buter à certains endroits et recommencer avec d'avantage de cartes en mains pour réussir.

J'ai joué au scénario de base (Asylum) et je n'ai testé aucune extension. Ce jeu m'a posé un gros problème, non pas au niveau de ses règles ... Mais du scénario lui même. Je ne spoilerai rien, mais en gros : plus le scénario avance, plus les jets de dés (donc le hasard) sont importants, et surtout, plus vous devrez faire face à des choix décisifs sans avoir aucun d'indice pour guider votre choix).

A la fin du scénario Asylum, plusieurs décisions doivent être prises sans savoir laquelle est la bonne. C'est du pile ou face et un mauvaix choix fera échouer votre partie. C'est rageant car ce genre de choix doit être fait de plus en plus souvent au fur et à mesure que l'on avance, et même à la toute fin du scénario vous devrez faire un choix au hasard, choix qui vous fera réussir ou échouer ! De plus, je note aussi que beaucoup d'éléments du scénario restent inexpliqués... Au final, nous ne savons pas ce que sont que ces failles temporelles dont on nous parle sans arrêt, et de nombreux points restent inexpliqués.

This game is a work of art. It is possibly the most beautiful game I have ever played. The mechanics are smooth and integrate with the adventure seamlessly. The adventure and role-playing aspect of it at first reminded me of my early role-playing experiences with Fighting Fantasy books - no bad thing. The adventure included in the core set is immersive and exciting with jeopardy and humour and provokes debate among the players as to which course of action to take. The only problem with this game is that once you've successfully completed a scenario by finding the correct solution, you are very unlikely to replay it. The good thing is that there are several expansions out already and I hope there will be more to come.

The game provides a really interesting framework for these mystery/adventure/story-telling experiences. TIME Stories is quite unlike anything else I've played, and I hope to play more of the adventures in the future.

...and the third time through Asylum was tedious enough to turn me off from the system. I could be talked into giving it a shot with one more case, but the game brought me back to old-school 3D adventure video games. If you're making progress it's incredible. But if you get stuck and are forced to spend time covering the same ground over and over, it is incredible frustrating. My gaming time is too precious to subject myself to that.

Story elements are fairly nicely presented (at least in some of the scenarios), but I was somewhat underwhelmed by the mechanisms. Felt like a more streamlined version of Mansions of Madness in many ways (with a different theme of course). After all the praise, I expected something more innovative and original.

And I'm also turned off by the fact that once you have successfully finished a scenario, you basically can't play it again without making the game unbalanced and potentially spoiling it for newcomers.

Most scenarios are also balanced so you HAVE TO play them at least twice (though four times is more likely) in order to be successful. Each time you go through you learn something new that you can use as a shortcut on your next run. So you'll end up going through the same story many times. This makes the game also feel a bit repetitive.

RATING: 7.5
I played the first scenario entirely until the end. Most of my thoughts are explained with the description of our runs (it contains tons of spoilers!).

What bothered me in our first case the was was the fact that you can get stuck and there is in fact no way to solve this: if you can't solve the puzzle/riddle, you're simply stuck, there are no possible extra hints (at the costs of T.U. or something like that). 
We knew there had to be traps, but some of them seemed a bit too harsh. Losing 5 T.U. is simply a lot if you only get 30 T.U. And if they wanna create dead ends, OK for me, but make sure it doesn't cost so much T.U. as the one in case 1.
And a last complaint: you should be able to keep more items. In the 3rd and final run going through the first rooms from the previous runs were you know where to find the items you need seemed a bit too artificial.

All above sounds very negative, but in fact I'm quite positive about my first experience with this game (otherwise I wouldn't rate it 7.5 after 1 case) and I'm looking forward to case number 2. 
The artwork is really gorgeous and I like the puzzle-solving aspect and you are really working together in this one.

Not a crazy fanatic. I see the joy in this game. I will continue to play the scenarios. I enjoy the time spent playing it. Ron hated it but I look forward to the other worlds like fantasy and ancient Egyptian. Worth playing if you are considering it. I don't even really like co-op which could be why I am lukewarm on the game.

In essence, this is a choose-your-own-adventure-book for multiple players. I very much enjoyed my first run of the game. However, as the scenario unfolded, I became rather disappointed in the choices it offered and the way the solution needed to be reached.

My current rating is mostly for the first scenario. I think I may enjoy the game more if later scenarios match my tastes better.

RATING: 4
I've only played the first story, but I honestly don't understand the hype around this game. There are better deductive reasoning (Sherlock Holmes Consulting detective comes to mind) better co-operative games, better everything. Yes it's pretty, but does really deserve all this hype?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Even though I can't play it again since I now know the play-through, I can still get the expansions. Or, I could act as "game masters" for others who haven't yet played it and enjoy it again through their adventure! I just loved the challenge and didn't even feel the hours go by. On first try we didn't complete and decided to begin anew the day after. This gave us the advantage of knowing the mechanics and  getting (the majority of) the rules down. Learning the rules before first play was key for us to not lose that feeling of adventure and excitement this game evokes. If you haven't played this game and like a long and exciting challenge, go for it as soon as you get the opportunity!

RATING: N/A
A lot has been said that it is best with 4 for the immersive experience of listening to others stories, so in a way may supplant the need for Witness (which doesn't appeal due to not knowing the theme). However the current surge of Escape Room designs may make TIME stories less appealing (or more so for a more coherent story)

Originally this was a 9, but over time I've greatly cooled on this game.  The expansions have generally gotten less and less interesting for me, and this game lives or dies by the expansion modules.

The first experience with the base module is far and away the most fun you will probably ever have with this game.  The expansions will just have you chasing that high and leaving just a little less fulfilled every time.

Single meta-play through w/base game (goal of perfect run) and each expansion (added cost/expensive).

A pleasant surprise.  My initial concerns about it being a "one and done" type game were quickly assuaged after an initial play.  You probably can't replay a scenario once you've won, but it seems like it is going to be a fun ride.

(I do not give numeric ratings for games I don't own)

Das Spielprinzip selber ist interessant und die unterschiedlichen Themen und Mechanismen von Geschichte zu Geschichte reizen mich sehr. Was mich an diesem Spiel (ich nenne es so, auch wenn ich es eher als Erlebnis ähnlich einem Film sehe) allerdings komplett aus den Socken haut, ist diese erste Geschichte. Ganz zu Beginn- Nervenheilanstalt Anfang des Jahrhunderts ist das Beste Setting was ich mir nur vorstellen kann. Die Charaktere und die übermittelte Grundstimmung sind herrlich schaurig und ziehen jeden Spieler in seinen Bann. Es machte mich fast traurig, dieses Szenario durchzuspielen, weil man eigentlich jede einzelne Ecke erforschen möchte- das muss man fast auch, um die wirklich schweren Rätsel zu lösen. Teilweise hat man sogar das Gefühl, dass das Spiel die Spieler spielt, weil es an jeder Ecke Sackgassen und kleine Spielereien gibt.
Ich kann dieses Spiel jedem empfehlen, der sich in andere Rollen und in die Geschichte hineinversetzen kann- diese erste Geschichte kann ich restlos jedem empfehlen!

The time travel genre is my favorite, but this is more like a video game where you can start a level over again, using info you found from previous runs. If it were true time travel, you would be able to interact with your past selves.

Wow.  Really super cool game.  It's like a board game version of Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow.  The pack-in scenario (each scenario can only be played through once, since you know all the answers after playing) is extremely well designed.  Good mix of puzzle solving, fighting, and emphasis on cooperation.  The characters all have downsides to mitigate, which creates interesting decisions.  Just a great experience all the way around.  
Also, you have to buy this base game to be able to play the other expansions, but it's akin to getting Super Mario Bros. as the pack in game with the Nintendo - You would have bought it anyway.

[b]Initial Comments:[/b] [i]02/12/2016[/i]
I don't have words. This is one of the greatest experiences in gaming I have ever had. Across all medium. Yeah, you can technically only play each scenario once but it's [i]so good[/i] that you won't care. Bring on more scenarios! This might be the first game to hold onto a ten for me.

[b]RO:[/b] [i]03/07/2016[/i]
Okay, so it's not a ten. It gets to join the prestigious club of games that I just love [i]so damn much[/i] that at first blush I very rashly rated them a ten, but it is [i]not[/i] a perfect game and for one of the major reasons I listed above. Scenarios are a one-off experience. Okay, sure, you [i]can[/i] play a scenario more than once (and I have!) but it's awful. See, the joy, the real mindgasmic euphoria this game can create is centered almost entirely on the thrill of discovery, peeling back the layers and optimizing your actions. The debate between (partially) clueless players about the solution, the revelations, the nail-biting suspense of seeing if the decision you just made is the right one or not. And [i]all[/i] (and I do mean [i][b]all[/i][/b]) of this vanished on repeat plays of a single scenario. If you enjoy fostering someone else through the experience, you might enjoy this, acting as an impartial (and unhelpful for all but attribute checks) observer and hand-holder, but otherwise you play the scenario and you move onto the next one when it is released. 

Is it fantastic? Oh lawds, yes. Is it replayable? Oh, hell no. I mean, the quality of the one-off experiences is still enough for me to rate this a nine and guarantee it stays in my collection for virtually as long as they support it. But it is not a good value for money compared within the hobby to my ~50 plays each of San Juan and Ascension (I don't care how you try to spin it, it's not, you are objectively wrong), and you do have to wait 3-4 months for each new story, so it will not see a significant number of tablings... well, ever, [i]but[/i] each experience is 3-4+ hours long, so each scenario is about $6 an hour (that's just under minimum wage!) so it's not a rip off and the uniqueness of the experience is certainly worth it in my humble opinion.

I really can't believe how many people are so high on this game.  First of all there's zero re-playability.  Once you've finished the game you've solved all the mysteries so there's no point in going through it again. Not worth the price of the game nor the set up time.  It would be better as a computer game.

Secondly there are several parts of the story that just aren't ever resolved.  I can't say much more without spoilers, but rather than wanting to read on we felt extremely let down.  Even the end was like "okay. We beat the bad guy, but what the heck were they doing?  Why did they need to be stopped and what would happen if we didn't?"  None of that was ever explained.  We felt extremely let down by this game.

This game has a good quality but i am an adventure fan and this game restricts me in to keep things secret even if its no fun or has meaning for me. I liked 1 only one puzzle in the game and wanted more of it = Unlock! 

Also the story is not new and interesting enough to keep me playing with joy and interest and there were only 2-3 cards with 2-3 different choices that were interesting.

And the ending is just ....  boring.

Hope the addons have the special thing to keep my interest on it!

I love the concept of a modular game system with expansions taking the system in different directions.  I thoroughly enjoy the deck exploration and mystery solving of the base module.  

However, the rule book is a bit obtuse and generic at times.  I understand they wrote it to avoid spoilers, but I feel if they had created a generic tutorial module to introduce the rules and concepts it would have been easier to learn.

Also, I have horrible luck rolling the dice in the game.  I mean, truly statistics-breaking failures time after time.

A wonderful story-driven game that contains beautiful, evocative artwork, full of clues, red-herrings, and actual hard puzzles [Asylum] to create a rich sense of immersion.

There are a few caveats to take into consideration:
1. Rapidly diminishing returns - replayability is almost zero after 3 runs [Asylum]
2. Cost per hour ratio - 4 and a half hours max for Asylum

I also felt that the ending of Asylum was weak, prosaic, and abrupt. Combined with the caveats above, my rating dropped by 1 point.

Rating for the system as a story driven thematic game. There is much potential in the system but clearly it is not used to its full potential. 

There should be more checkpoints and essential items shouldn't be discarded. This is done to some extent but usually not well enough. Usually the game becomes are tedious grind and question of optimizing your moves with a lot of dice rolling added into the mix. Even if you know what to do and in what order, the game can be decided by the luck of the dice. If winning becomes question of grinding through  repetitive simplistic dice rolling tasks over and over again, it is not a game, it is only a painful and frustrating activity.  

Notice for potential buyers: There is absolutely no reason to play the same story again. In essence the replay value is zero.

T.I.M.E Stories ha de ser valorado más como experiencia de juego que como tal, ya que su rejugabilidad es absolutamente nula una vez llegado al final de cada caso/mazo de cartas.
Como experiencia de juego es excelente, un juego casi perfecto (quizás hay alguna pequeña regla en el manual que se da a diferentes interpretaciones, pero que no tienen incidencia en la esencia del desarrollo normal de la partida). El diseño y la narrativa están perfectamente engranados y la inmersión es total, llevándote a querer llegar hasta al final en una única sentada (aprox. 5 horas en el escenario base).
El grave problema es que el juego es como un room-escape, una vez jugado el caso/mazo este ya no tiene sentido volver a ser jugado por el mismo grupo de jugadores, lo que implica que es un juego de una sesión (45€, entre 4 jugadores y 5 horas significa un coste de 2,25 €/jugador/hora, que no parece tanto, pero que sabe a poco).
Por esta última razón mi valoración final es un 8, ya que para poder disfrutar será necesario seguir comprando los nuevos saltos que vayan sacando, que seguramente nos darán sesiones memorables de juego pero a costa de tenernos que rascar los bolsillos.

I like that it has so many possibilities for future stories. I didn't buy it at first, because there's only one story in the first one. But that one story took us at least 2 days/3 plays to solve. And the system is very versatile! The first story is also really nice.

Such an interesting game, and a lot of fun for what it was.  I can see why a lot of people go crazy for this game, but we obviously are not as excited about story telling games as many other people are.  We really liked the time optimization and the puzzle aspects, but it wasn't worth the price. I would much rather buy a different game that we can play over and over again.  But we did trade it away for Seasons, so at least we got something out of it when we were done with it!

30-03-2017. I avoided T.I.M.E. stories for some time because the low replayability and the hype surrounding it. 

T.I.M.E stories resolved around the players visiting locations by traveling on a map, discovering locations (by flipping and reading cards) and fighting enemies. Traveling, discovering and fighting takes time, and when you run out you have a repeat of game in order to do better next time. That makes T.I.M.E stories basically a puzzle, that you'll need to optimize.  

Since starting somewhere in 2016, I've played the base game Asylum case, Marcy case and Prophecy of dragons.Of those,  I think I liked the Asylum best, but all 3 are fine.

Closest thing to a pen and paper RPG in board game form that I I've played. It still doesn't replace a well-run RPG, but when I'm looking for a self-contained story that can be run quickly and GM-less, this scratches a similar itch. Immersive, narrative driven experience.

I enjoyed the exploration portion of the game and my group fully got into the characters (receptacles) that they chose to play. Unfortunately, my group is NOT one that found the Riddle of the Pentacles fun or clever. 

I expect your mileage may vary; but how you and your group reacts to that challenge will determine your enjoyment of the game and sadly people can't talk about it to give new players a heads up whether this is a game they will enjoy exploring or not. 

My rating is a combination of my group's frustration with the ending, the fact you can only play the game once (nature of the beast in a mystery game), and the difficulty in explaining more completely why the game may or may not be for someone new.

Fantastic engine for story-telling that solves a question that's haunted other story-games. What happens when you're done with all the story? There's potential to GM a game with your friends if they want to play the game and you already have. The case that comes with this one isn't that interesting but there's clearly potential for more. The main weakness is combat which is just dice-rolling and doesn't have enough tension, although I can forgive that in a game that is so unique in other ways.

10. Outstanding. I'll play this as long as they offer modules. I do know I'll always be glad that I invested in it.

So this is a weird one. It was ton of fun for the first 3/4s of the Asylum-- two run throughs. Thematic, atmospheric, lots of mystery and fun . . . 1 huge laugh! And then the ending was a complete letdown. No reason for any of it, no clear answer as to what was going on or why . . . I was really deflated but immediately bought The Marcy Case. I also thought and thought and thought about the whole session, and a game experience that sticks with you like that is pretty priceless.

I got the Marcy Case to the table as soon as I could. One week after Asylum, exactly. The Marcy Case was much better, we all agreed. It showed off what this system can do and did a beautiful, thematic job. It was just a better story.

As soon as there was a sale at CSI, I picked up both the other available expansions, even though neither was on sale.

I really have nothing against this game, really nothing, trust me on that. But, being a voracious and extremely experienced roleplay gamer...it does not feel right to me to buy a game thinking it's a board game...and then find myself with a roleplay game that got a time travel twist to more or less force you to not play every scenario in a single run, thus giving you an amusingly false feeling of longevity. 
Yes, the art is awesome, the design is quite clever and all...but it's not a board game. It's an extremely concentrated RPG campaign that i really doubt someone would gladly pay around 50 euros when dices, characters, rules and an appropriate combat simulation are not even a thing to begin with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Horrible.  Just horrible.  I expected a character rich, story-driven game.  What I got was a stupid story with one-dimensional characters and mediocre combat punctuated with having to restart the game every now and then and run through the same shit we'd already been through.  As it's impossible to figure out the right path through the game without trial and error, this "game" is just constantly going down different paths until you find the right one and then speed through it.

How anyone can think this system is anything but trash is beyond me.  I'd rather just read a choose your own adventure book.

Tragedy Looper is far superior a gaming experience...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Very close to a really fun game. 

Here's the deal:  The game suffers completely from a lack of an "introductory" scenario.  I don't just mean the first case, Asylum, but they should have put a quick 30 minute puzzle in the base box to let people get the hang of the game before sending them into a full scenario.  We wasted SO much time trying to figure out what the hell to do while our experience in the first full case suffered because of it.

The second major problem, as I see it, or at least for the group I played with: The game devolved into arguing about who's memory was the best instead of letting us actually solve puzzles.  No where in the rules does it say you can (or can't) write down information you obtain during your runs.  So we kept going back to clues we'd already found before because one person remembered them differently than another.  And this made the game tedious, frustrating, and unfun.  

By the end of our first couple of attempt,s hours had passed and everyone was frustrated.  We put the game away (saved to continue) and grudgingly agreed to finish it the next day.

It was then, after visiting the forums, that I realized the game could have been much more fun IF WE JUST WROTE EVERYTHING DOWN.  This was sold to me (through written and audio reviews) as an experience game.  and the experience suffered because we didn't retain information we found.  As soon as I came to the forums there were threads of people suggesting you write things down to really enjoy the game, and to have a chance to complete it, especially across multiple sessions.  

We returned to our game and I wrote down some specific information we had found the night before.  And you know what - it was pretty enjoyable for me from then on out.  But everyone else was so fed up wit hthe game, they had no desire to come together again in a month, or even several, to play the next scenario.  

So please, for the love of everything - talk to your group about the option of writing down things you think are important.  If this game is REALLY about the experience, then I think this is of vital importance.  

For me, the game is basically over before it began.  Perhaps my 5.5 rating is unfair, but everyone else would have rated it lower.  I know theres a good game in there, I jsut think the publisher should have offered an introductory scenario and guidance that if groups wish, they can write things down.  Or at least put it out there that some folks do...

After completing the Asylum case...

Wow!  What a thoroughly enjoyable experience and a unique one too as far as I'm concerned.  

Playing as a Time Agent sent back in time to discover and halt an anomaly, you'll take control of a "receptacle" (a person living in that time) and interact with their world via cards.  Those cards may be laid out as a very nicely painted panorama, from which you'll secretly read only those to which you move (and, possibly, interact further in tests of combat, persuasion or deftness), to gain others that are designated "items", of which there are several types, not just your typical key, axe and bucket.

Addictive fun for my group, left wanting more, so, docked 0.5 of a point for making me wait so long between cases.

This game was so much fun. It's a mix of choose your own adventure, D&D, XCOM, and so many others. The adventure you get to experience is phenomenal fun combined with overwhelming excitement. The only reason I did not give it 10 stars is the fact that one puzzle in the game was unclear and, once solved, it didn't give you that satisfaction the rest of the game gave you. Overall great game though, and I would recommend every gamer play. The rules seem complicated at first, but it is super easy once you start!

Played through first scenario (4 time to complete). Started by really loving it, ended frustrated and let down.

The game does not have as many decisions to make as i thought it would. The dice resolution mechanic is lame, the pieces are horrible. The cards are the only component that raises the game from a 3 to a 4.

Interesting premise, intriguing characters, nice puzzles along the way, and then...
a vital puzzle has a cheap, gamey solution for an anticlimactic finish.
Ultimately disappointing.
Interactions should offer more choices of approach -- while one or two offered talk vs. combat, there should be more opportunities to approach things based upon your current receptacle - attempt to pickpocket (dexterity), persuade (speech) or attack (combat), with some results converging on the same solution and others introducing complications or bonus rewards.
This is successful (for good and bad) at capturing the feel of playing a computer adventure, with gamey solutions and a "railroaded" feel to interactions.

Egyedi egyszer játszható történetmesélős, szabadulós játék a Time Stories. A játékosok időutazókat alakítanak, akik az időben visszamenve ottani emberek bőrébe bújva próbálnak egy múltban történt időhibát kijavítani. A múltbeli helyszíneket kártyák jelenítik meg, egy-egy helyszínen több bejárható rész van, ahol a játékosok a kártyákon talált információkat begyűjtve, megoldva próbálnak rájönni a rejtély megoldására. Ahogy egy szabadulós játékban itt sem tudunk előre semmit, minden a felfedezések hatására ismerszik meg. Minden cselekvés időbe kerül, ez az egyik cél, hogy adott idő alatt oldjuk meg a feladatot. Meghalni ugyan meglehet, de kiesni a játékból nem. Az információkon kívül különböző próbákat kell megoldanunk, amit a szereplőink képességeivel kockapróbákkal teljesíthetünk. Ezen kívül minden szereplő rendelkezik különleges képességekkel is. A játéktábla puritán és sok szükség nincs rá, a kártyák ellenben gyönyörűek. A kockadobálás nem tetszett, de nehéz jobb ötlettel megoldani a szerencsét a játékban. Az alapjátékban található történet érdekes és nem egyszerű. Meg is lepődtem, 3. nekifutásra sikerült megoldanunk, de sajnos még így is elbuktunk a legvégén. A játék rettentően nyelvfüggő és minden játékosnak tudnia is kell jól értelmezni az egyes szövegeket a kártyákon. A Pandemic Legacy-nál nekem sokkal jobban tetszett a játék, ez az egyszer játszhatóság ebben a megoldásban sokkal jobban ül, cserében egy történet ténylegesen csak egyszer játszható, bár évek múlva talán azért elővehető. Tetszett a TIMES nagyon, de jelenleg nincs szívem nagyobb pontot adni neki a kockadobálás és az újrajátszhatósági faktor nulla volta miatt. Ettől függetlenül mindenkinek ajánlom kipróbálásra, nagy élmény.

-Greatly enjoyed my experience with the first two scenarios, but you need a steady group, and it cost too much to keep going. Hoping to pick it up again one day.

RATING: 4
The concept of TIME Stories is interesting. The worlds you explore are very interesting. The production is good and most of the art is evocative. Unfortunately, there is no game here. You simply read cards and occasionally roll some dice. One of the actions in the game is literally "Do Nothing." Your first run of any scenario will be fun as you explore things and follow clues. Then you have to restart because you ran out of time. This is the worst part of this experience. You basically start over and try again, using the things you've learned on your previous run to make better choices. Except it's half as interesting because you don't bother reading the cards anymore. By your third run, you've forgotten about the experience and are simply flying through cards and locations to a cliched and predictable ending. So disappointing. Couple this with the fact that this game retails for $60 and you can only play once? Forget it.

This is an experience that uses a game format.

I loved it. Everyone that played it with me has loved it. It just doesn't feel like a true board game, more like a roleplaying system. I say this because you will make choices based on what character you are playing as and because the main game (this one) leads into expansions like a type of campaign. You could play this by itself but if you decide you like it, you will definitely want more.

If you are okay with spending what some would consider a lot of money for roughly five hours of playtime and enjoy solving puzzles, this is your "game".

The premise is essentially a card-managed paragraph story generator.   Only played once with three players and would like to finish the story, but my group grew bored with it, so I'm not sure how another "run" will get done.  The game is certainly dependent upon the right spirit of role playing within the group.    If your group doesn't have it, the game is a bit of a chore.  There are unique characters in the game which can change with each "run" giving it a bit of structure which would differentiate it's otherwise straightforward puzzle-solving core from a game like, say, Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective.

Expansions played: The Marcy Case, A Prophecy of Dragons

An engrossing narrative adventure for 2-4 players.  I definitely enjoy this game, but would simultaneously hesitate to recommend it to others.  The best way to describe this game is an amalgamation of a choose-your-own-adventure book and one of those escape rooms that seem to be in vogue nowadays.  Fortunately, I love both of those things, so I'm willing to pay the proverbial price of admission for new modules.  As a bonus, the art and design are both top-notch.  Perhaps my biggest complaint (at least with the base game) is that the game seems to heavily discourage exploration and experimentation, which is a shame for a game whose ambiance is as rich as this one.

I've played the base game with 2, but would probably enjoy the game more with 4.

"TIME Stories" is a truly unique experience in the tabletop space. 

The base game is more of a "console" that games are plugged into. It comes with a single story module, in the form of a deck of cards. That single deck of cards provides visuals, as you splay them on the board creating striking panoramas of your current surroundings within the game world. That deck also provides a plot in a simple worker placement style game rife with puzzles to overcome and stories to be absorbed in.

Each expansion provides a different deck, with new visuals in myriad artistic interpretations, with wildly varied stories to tell. 

This is the best story telling game of all time. Each time a new expansion is released I'm excited for it to hit the table, to explore a new reality, and place in time, to solve the puzzles and plunder the depths of it's newest mystery.

Perhaps the most pure of the "legacy" mechanic that has become fashionable of late in boardgaming. This is only on the surface a boardgame, and while you do have characters and are rolling to survive checks, most of the game revolves around the story that you are trying to discover and solve. It's almost more like a puzzle or mystery than a boardgame, but that doesn't make it any less fun. The art is simply stunning, and the descriptions are well written enough such that you are really engaged. While the replayability is non-existent without purchasing additional scenarios, the initial game seems to have a few hours of gameplay as you'll need to multiple runs to complete it, and expansions are going to be pretty inexpensively priced, this is something new, different, and interesting, especially for the more social gamer.

2nd play (Marcy Case), 3er
Yup, this game is not for me: 4-->2

---
1 play, 4er

This is a board game version of those old adventure style computer games (like Myst, Zork): you explore the environment, interacting with people/scenery trying to collect clues in order to solve the big puzzle (likely with little puzzles along the way). This time there's a time travel theme, so you can go through the game repeatedly having a bit more information each time -- just like restarting those old computer games. Of course, if you need some key pieces of equipment, or if you just can't remember exactly what you saw where, you'll end up doing the same things repeatedly. 

Unfortunately for me, I HATE those puzzley computer games! I hate having to memorize everything I do along the way, having to do it over and over again, having to work out all those annoying puzzles, having options presented to me with no basis given for which option is the "right" or better choice, getting smacked around for it ... HATE it!

I'd try it once again, if only in the hope that it will be better having actually learned the rules (why in the hell couldn't the rule book have explained things better?); and the fact that we bought the first expansion (Marcy case) as well as the base game. But I do not have high hopes.

AND WHY THE HELL IS THERE NO PERIOD AFTER THE E IN T.I.M.E ??!!?

RATING: 6
There are some neat storytelling ideas in this game, but for my tastes it relies too much on random factors. Non-mitigatable dice rolls, no clues as to what rooms you should be searching / ignoring, etc. Plus, I'm not keen on re-playing a scenario multiple times & having to rely on knowledge of previous run throughs. 

It's also not balanced for less than 4 players. For example, in scenario 1 where you get 25 time units theoretically (ignoring time loss due to movement) in a 4 player game you have a total of 100 actions to split amongst players. In a 3 player game that reduces to 75. The manual recommends starting a 30 time units, but you're still down by 20. Makes a big difference if you're not keen on multiple play-throughs -- with 20 time units you can potentially explore up to 3 rooms in full.

I was very resistant to buying this game.  A 40-50 dollar price tag for a single play (and additional plays available at 30 bucks a pop) was just too much.  I'm not against the idea of "consumable" games.  I'm currently in the middle of a Pandemic: Legacy playthrough and finished a Risk: Legacy playthrough and look forward to Seafall.  To a certain extent games like Descent and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, which I have also played, are also consumable where while you CAN play them again it would be far less interesting after you have once (and for that matter there is nothing stopping you from playing through Pandemic or Risk: Legacy after a campaign ends either).  This game (or more specifically the included scenario) absolutely cannot be played through again after playing it once.  It is an adventure/mystery game and knowing the answers prevents you from playing it honestly again.

Sure, one "play" can be 2-3 sessions taking up to 5 hours but I have other games that take that long for a single play.  I have also heard the argument that many people have games they've spent this much for that they haven't played more than once or at all.  I do indeed have games I have only played once or not at all yet, but if I still own it I INTEND to play it again and I CAN.  I have also heard it was a good game so I was at least interested even if I wouldn't spend my own money for it, and to that end I actually won it in a G4GG auction which while not necessarily free, I earned my geek gold by giving away games of my own, is an investment I was at least comfortable with.

Okay, end of rant, onto the game.  Like I said, it is an adventure/mystery solving game.  The players are time travelers from the future jumping into the bodies of people in the past Quantum Leap-style to prevent some time destroying disaster from happening.  You do this by exploring areas and rolling dice to conquer challenges and find clues until some end game condition happens.  This usually takes multiple "runs" so you return to changed locations over and over again with new information and items until you reach the end of the adventure.

Honest-to-god, with a completely open mind, I just DO NOT get the love for this game from the board game community.  Completely taking the restrictive pricing model out of the picture, I now own a copy of this, and while it is a fine game it is nothing special.  You go from location to location, finding items to unlock new locations, and rolling dice corresponding to character stats to pass challenges like so many other coops out there.  Granted, this game has a much more cohesive story than something like Eldritch Horror or Robinson Crusoe, but the gameplay is actually less than those other games.

Even if you are really into story over substance though, and I can get that, a really good interactive story can elevate a game with less exciting gameplay, the story isn't THAT good.  This is with the caveat that I haven't finished the Asylum scenario yet, maybe there are some marquee moments and twists coming that will really change my mind.  But I'm 2 hours and 1 session into the game, which by all accounts is on average about halfway through and nothing has really impressed me yet.  In fact, sometimes quite the opposite.  There are often decisions, sometimes major ones, you as a player can make with no information to support them.  You really just randomly guess and deal with the consequences.

One thing I will say though is the game does look great.  The stark and clean base game components which are meant to act as a framework for any scenario look amazing against the beautiful watercolor cards that make up the location panoramas.  I also really do love how the box is designed to "save" your place in the game if you have to stop in the middle of a session.  Past that though everything in this game from story to content to actual gameplay is incredibly average.  Hearing nothing but accolades for this game I wasn't convinced to support the ridiculous pricing structure of this game.  Having played it and found it incredibly mediocre really baffles me.

Not bad at all, but the base game is terribly costly, the expansions are overpriced and they greatly vary in quality. Gameplay can get repetitive. You do feel like you just have to try every option regardless of intuition and foresight in order to win at some point on repeated play, so victory feels like something achieved trough trial and error more than puzzle solving.

In the end, I would suggest to pass.

I really like T.I.M.E Stories, but any praise must be prefaced with the obvious: it slices my soul like razor blades dipped in cheap mojito mixer that there isn't a period/full stop after the "E" in "T.I.M.E". 

I can't find any explanation for the lack of dot. Surely it's not like it was left off in a reflexive act of symmetry, a la when people write "R.I.P" - that's twitchily bothersome, but at least you can tell that they got caught up in decorating the "I". 

Something as slick as TIME Stories (I'm just going to go with period-less acronym style) shouldn't have such a basic error that points to the end times of civilization. (I'm a descriptivist when it comes to language use, I swear, but...) I hope that future reprints will fix this, even if it means that for some of us the base game and shrinkwrapped expansions won't match. (The Social Punctuation Contract trumps OCD!) That, or come up with a cool story to explain the missing full stop. 

About those shrinkwrapped expansions... they're still doing the Laura Palmer trick because my husband and I have yet to solve the base game. After getting stuck and turning to the internet for a tiny-tiny bit of clarification (fools that we are), we accidentally got a teeny spoiler (grr, forums without text-hiding tools...), so if all is lost we probably know how to continue, but of course it would be more fun to do things ourselves. However, now so much time has passed since we marathoned the base game that the thought of starting again and refamiliarizing ourselves with the game and what we already know is daunting. (New rule: take notes.)

I know that some people don't like controlling multiple characters in the two-player variant. Considering how much I hate doing this in Mysterium, it surprisingly doesn't bother me here. I guess the body hopping just fits the technology for me.

Something I don't like is the "oh, you failed a couple of times, now just take all the time you want, whatevers..." element. I understand the reasoning, but it seems to happen a little soon (or maybe we just haz dumbs), and it killed some of the immersion for us. We decided that the next time we played (which still has yet to happen), we'd still impose some time restrictions on ourselves. We're not settling for participation ribbons just yet!

I am so impressed with the originality of the "decksploration" concept, and I'm genuinely very excited for that time when we finish the base game (or at least pass our current hurdle - no idea how much is left after that) and can play the expansions (is that really the right word?) then eagerly get to await all of the new releases. 

So, I don't know if the "7.9" rating is quite accurate from me. TIME Stories was making me really happy, but the fact is that it hasn't come back to the table, and I have a list of other games that I want to play or play again before it does. Future Me will probably (hopefully) come back to re-rate this and scoff at this period of my life while envying me of my time-traveling adventures yet to come.

UPDATE: Played and played some more. Scoffed at Past Me. Even if I dislike all future expansions as much as I dislike Prophecy of Dragons, this is such a clever and fun game.

Lowering to an 8.9.
After the hype and honeymoon has faded a bit, the game is still innovative and incredible, but noticing some things I'd like changed. One is that the dice combat can sometimes screw you over, to the point where your entire run can end just because of one card (only rarely happens though). The second thing is that the two stories I've played have had fairly unsatisfying endings. There is this huge ramp up right before and then when the game ends, it's sort of like... "was that it?" That being said, the art, the experience, the immersion, the innovation, the stories, everything is spot on. 

The most engaging and most beautiful game I have EVER played. The artwork and design is incredible and the game itself sucks you in immediately.

I played with a couple other people who are not gamers and who do not like going too deep with games. But as soon as we started playing this game, they were sucked in immediately.

A bit pricey, but I think it's well worth the money.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The components are decent, but the artwork is beautiful and the storyline is pretty good. It keeps you interested throughout and the gradual revelation of the overarching mystery is really well done. The only real problem I have is that it's easy to get yourself into a position where it feels like the game is unwinnable because one of the puzzles requires some esoteric outside the box thinking, especially if you take a specific route through the game. It's not, but it requires some long, hard perusal of the items you do have in order to play properly. Still, this is not a bad thing necessarily; just something you should be forewarned about before playing. 

Original Rating: 8/10

EDIT: I played again with another group of mine because three of them wanted to play and they needed a fourth. I was interested in testing the replayability of the game, as there had been about two months between scenarios. Unfortunately, the game was either too fresh in my mind or the main puzzle to solve was just too memorable, as the experience was dreadfully boring. I tried to pretend that I didn't know what was coming, but as we entered each new location I remembered exactly what would happen and where. I was a good soldier and mostly tried not to guide the team too much down the correct path, but the experience was torturous just due to how games like this work. 

If you've ever played an old NES game, you'll know what I mean. Those games usually required a ton of trial and error or pattern memorization, but once you know the solution, you can comfortably complete them in fifteen minutes. Ultimately, this is true of T.I.M.E Stories as well, leading to the game feeling extremely shallow. It was hard sitting there going the wrong way numerous times when I wanted to just get to the main puzzle and beat the game already. It really is a one and done experience. My rating for replay is 2, so I'll just take the average and give the game a 5/10.

This is a very good game.  It's major draw back is replayability.  You can keep playing an adventure until you solve it and then must move on to an expansion adventure.  That means the price per hour of entertainment you get out of it is high for a board game.  However, the actual entertainment is very good.

The game is essentially chose your own adventure turned into a board game, but is done very well.  It is also beautifully produced and has a look and feel which is very different for board games.  It is also highly thematic with a very simple rule set.  It also is compatible with some light role playing although the game overhypes this aspect.

So an excellent game, but expensive for the time involved.  However, I have a rich friend who owns it, so that's ideal.

What do you want out of this?

If it is mystery solving, Mythos Tales is superior.

If it is exploring a spooky place, Mansions of Madness 2nd edition is superior.

You may ask yourself why am I comparing this game to those two horror based (quasi fantasy/sci fi) games?

Because TIME Stories makes a HUGE error in theme by not being a time traveling sci fi game played straight.

No, they make it fantasy/horror as well.  What a miss!

I cannot say how much that revelation disappointing my group.

I am very let down by the positive press this game has gotten.  And the combat, lol.

What a missed opportunity.  Easily the most overrated game I've played in the past 2 years.

Another evolution of the gamebook, T.I.M.E Stories uses the conceit of a "12 Monkeys" meets "Quantum Leap" agency: players travel in time or to alternate dimensions, inhabiting bodies of characters there, to collectively solve mysteries represented by decks of cards.

Decks consist primarily of locations, cards combined to produce a panoramic picture. Each card in a location is also a specific element to be investigated (talk to the young man in the corner, look at the painting on the wall etc.), usually resulting in either information, a test (such as a fight, via dice rolling) or an item. Some locations are locked without specific triggers, such as already having visited another area or having an item. All of this costs time units; once the team runs out they are whisked back to the T.I.M.E Agency HQ and will need to go back in for another run, this time forearmed with knowledge from previous runs.

In The Asylum, the only case included in the base set, this works much the way you would expect. Completing the case requires solving a single large puzzle requiring information from areas so spread out as to be very difficult to obtain by accident in a single run. There are several traps, one major dead end and a secret.

It essentially plays out like a point-and-click adventure game, in the Sierra/LucasArts/etc. tradition, in board form. It's better than its gamebook antecedents in a number of ways, most notably the lavish illustrations and the map mechanism that, as with the combination map and and directory in Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, gives players real agency in choosing where to go and what to do.

Enjoyable as it is, though, it's assuredly not perfect.

Some elements of The Asylum, and I assume later scenarios, are frustrating because of the game's not entirely successful combination of roleplaying and puzzle. A number of trap cards, for example, resulting in useless combat or other delays, were easily avoidable, entirely predictable consequences of obviously poor decisions. In-universe, punching a policeman in the face seems like a bad idea; but as a game with limited choices, if we players have been given the opportunity then should we give it a go? I imagine that to get the most out of the experience, you really need to play as though every action is precious and not chase down every single lead. But since the story is more interesting than the mechanisms, and the entire conceit of the game is that multiple runs are required, the time pressure isn't really felt.

Similarly, random elements like combat are quite enjoyable and menacing with the energy of the mystery to sustain interest, but irritating afterwards -- we died on the final Asylum boss, for example, and pretended we didn't because it was all in a series of spectacularly terrible rolls (e.g. 1 damage from 9 dice). Why bother doing another run?

I'm also hopeful that some future puzzles may be a little more organic. A big part of the charm of Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective (and similar games like Gumshoe) is that the mysteries are based on clues like inconsistencies in witness testimony. There's a real worry that the mechanical trappings of T.I.M.E Stories will force nothing but clumsy letter/number based puzzles.

Still, I liked it enough that a few more scenarios are on the way.

Rating incorporates play of case 1, The Asylum, only.

RATING: 5
I'm firmly in the "does not work well with 2 players" camp.Verbose rule book makes it sound MUCH more complicated than it actually is. By the end of our second run we were quite bored and not keen on seeing it through. There were no suprises or wow moments as I expected from other reviewers.

Lastly, this truely is more an activity than a game. The only decisions in the game are what card to flip over first, and some minor storey path choices that you generally repeat anyway. Fine if that's what you want, just know that going in.

RATING: 5
Fun game but completely impractical to buy unless you're gonna loan it out to your friends. Three plays of the included scenario took 2.5 hours, that would be terrible RoI if I hadn't borrowed it.

UPDATE: Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition does what this game does far better. It's also a better value proposition.

UPDATE: Played Expedition: Endurance, final thoughts on the system itself. The TUs you're allocated (at least with three players) is too few to allow forgetting where required items are to unlock new paths, so writing down your encounters is a must. (Especially so if you don't brute force each mission in one day with the same group.) Since you're doing that, plotting your runs becomes a must after the first or second run so you don't waste time. That turns this game into a luckfest where you're hoping you randomly choose the right cards to flip over so you can discover where you need to go before the run is over, so you can complete the mission in the fewest number of runs. Some of the scoring options are literally impossible, like beating some missions on one or even two runs. The Egypt adventure took FIVE runs because I forgot to write down ONE location encounter. Dropped rating to a 5. This is barely a game.

I love this game. The story-telling element and mystery is incredibly compelling and makes you want to discover more. Now the stuff I don't love. I am not in love with the rule book. I originally thought the rules sounded quite simple until I needed clarification while playing the actual game. The box insert for saving the game was a great idea, but was flimsy and broken from the start. And lastly, I wish the starter scenario would have been more family friendly. The theme can be disturbing and there is a lot of gore and some risque scenes that are definitely not for younger audiences. All that being said, I still love the concept. There are so many possibilities with time travel scenarios. I can't wait to play more. Keep in mind that this is a game system and you will need to purchase additional scenarios if you want to continue enjoying the game. Once you know a given story, replay-ability is almost nil.

I love the idea and the art is fantastic, but out of 4 scenarios played 1 was good, 1 was meh, 1 was fine and the other was hugely frustrating. When the game gives you puzzles to solve and mysteries to unravel it's a good time. But when you know exactly what you need to do and how to do it, and you have to replay the same section 3 times because of bad dice rolls...I'm out.

If you can borrow a copy, play a friend's copy, or play this at a con, by all means go for it. The very limited replay value is, IMHO, quite a big hit against it though.

This is a clever adaption of point-and-click adventure games to board game format. I'm a big fan of P&C games, so I find that kind of cool, but it does make me wonder: is there really any NEED to turn these into a boardgame? This probably would have been better as a computer game.

The game makes clever use of cards to have a repeatable plotline, and includes neat features like showing a panorama scene composed of multiple cards for characters to interact with. Playing the game is fun and sucks you into trying to figure out what is going on and to solve the mystery.

However, the plot itself is quite weak, and very inconsistent in genre and tone (sometimes in really tacky ways). Don't expect to actually have things make much sense.

The overall setup of repeating loops is a neat concept, but the specific implementation leaves a lot to be desired, crushing player input in favor of heavy-handed external controls. This could have handled much better with some simple tweaks and flavor changes.

Our group had the first game of this on Saturday. We are half way through our third run (yes our third) of the Asylum mission that comes with the base game. 
We are totally immersed in the concept and story of this game,and we are looking forward to playing/experiencing the other scenarios. (23/01/16)

We finished the Asylum scenario after the third run, was a bit disappointed with the final solution and think maybe we went through it a bit too fast (31/01/16)

I don't understand the Hype. OK, the game brings on some nice atmosphere and has technically some nice ideas BUT:
- it is basically pure try and error. There is no material deduction element in the game. You just have to try and when you realized it did not help you much you try to mesmerize where was what effect for the next round to optimize respectively to avoid it.
- any tactical/strategic elements are really limited and not really material as these decisions may not have any beneficiary effect (see the point above related to Try and error)
- The Rules leave way too many open questions (which are at least partly answered in an unofficial FAQ segment at BGG)
Due to these reasons I find the game quite boring.

Awful experience for us. After reading the rules twice things were still too unclear. We finished after 8 hours with a bit of cheating to avoid wasting another hour of dry play. Nothing special in the story for a puzzle game; your average puzzle/enigma game is far better than this. After the first two runs it gets very repetitive.

Production quality is also lacking with the insert arriving broken in multiple places and the deck of cards had lots of dust inside; we had to clean each card individually.

As an alternative, The Witness for PC is an amazing game in the same category.

tl;dr: interesting, but unsure how much I like it

Deduction and co-op are not my favorite elements in games, so putting them together doesn't sound very appealing. But of course, when a game gets as much attention as this one gets, I want to try it.
So this is a scenario based game, and you walk around from location to location, gathering items and clues to solve a mystery. Everyone has a character with some skills that can be quite different. That's more akin to your run-of-the-mill RPG title, also not my favorite. But it works pretty well and it's all quite streamlined.
We had to play the scenario 3 times to get through it. Each play took about 1 hour. 1 hour is fine. 3 hours is not so fine. And there are ways to save your game between runs, but you don't want to do that because then you will have to take a lot of notes, and that's no fun, is it? So, that's a bit annoying but 3 hours is still OK if you plan ahead.
So I found it fairly enjoyable but I had a couple of issues with it. The main one being that this is not really my style. But I recognize the quality of the design.
Which brings me to my main gripe with the game. This game is sold for the price of a big box game. It is scenario based. The scenarios cannot be replayed. The box comes with only one scenario. ONE! That is a ripoff. Now you have to fork out €20 or €25 each and every time you want to play this game again. That is just shameful! Games with scenarios that you cannot replay should include 10 scenarios or more. I don't fork out money for a game to play it once. So I won't be forking out money for this game and wouldn't recommend anyone do so.

If a game is a series of interesting decisions, then this is barely a game. Linear and pedestrian, with little sense of escalation.  Mechanically awful, to the point where failing a dice roll means you spent your whole turn having no effect whatsoever on the game state.

Still, at least I have this incredible story that everyone is so excited about. Or, maybe not.  I'm convinced that those heaping praise upon the writing have never read a truly great story.  This is sixth-form level tripe, overwrought and barely held together with lazy tropes.  Oh and characterising the mentally ill as monstrous? Nice work guys, bring on the zombies and elves.

Kind of surprised with this one, I really enjoyed it until it came to the win, really an unknown puzzle, really was frustrated. The puzzle that needed to be solved was a mechanic I don't think was clearly presented as part of the game / mechanics - I'm surprised it's as high up as it is (ranked on BGG) as a one time play to win. it's like solving a video game in 5 hours. The opening setting really was irreverent to the game and the story of the game.
There's really only one path to win, I would almost say this is a twist one the story telling games like Tales of the Arabian Nights just not as big of a scale and you have to purchase more expansions to have additional plays

RATING: 6
I was really intrigued by this game, as it was strongly recommended by a friend. However, after playing the base adventure, I was left with a sour taste in my mouth. The game is structured like an "escape the room" sort of puzzle, framed as a mystery to solve. However, there's no consistent logic to any choices you may make.
Early on we learned that interacting with other characters may net us items or clues for later use, or they may cause encounters that could harm us or waste precious "time" (the game has a "beat the clock" mechanic to keep things moving).
However, choosing where to go and who to talk to is often purely a guessing game. Certain conversations or items may be clues as to where to go next, but most of the time you walk into a room and just head towards what looks interesting. And even those may be misleading. This is a slight hyperbole, but if you enter an area to find a man in one corner mumbling, "I'mma cut ya..", talking to him has just as much a chance to get stabbed as it does to get a free knife that you need for a later puzzle. Since it's all a guessing game, the time limit is the only real reason not to just explore and interact with everything -- and that seems to be the idea. Since the time limit doesn't end the game, but forces you to start all over again armed with new knowledge, there's less mystery-solving and more trial and error. And that gets very repetitive quickly. After our first rewind, I had already begun to see the seams tearing.
Overall, while the initial novelty is neat and worth a look, I can't really recommend T.I.M.E Stories. I've heard each expansion case is very different, and I am interested in trying again on a new story, but the base is entirely skippable and, if you're like me (I know I am), it may run the risk of almost turning you off entirely.

The long-term success of the T.I.M.E. Stories system will hinge on the publisher selling follow-on story packs.   However, the experience is not immersive.  The card art is dwarfed by a giant white board, and the flavor text in the base is scanty.  Combat is primitive.  I'm not sure that the bland environment and reusable components will sustain gamers' interest--except in the near-certain development of fan fiction.  But if this works, T.I.M.E. Stories could be a large and lucrative franchise à la the Choose Your Own Adventure book series.

Played with my wife as a two player game. Was amazing and we had a great time. Took us about 3 hours in total to finish the Asylum and we have talked about it for a few days after. Was quite the experience.

As far as the price point, didn't bother me at all. 3 hours of solid memorable entertainment was well worth it. Especially considering my wife isn't a gamer and she has already told me to buy every expansion that comes out so that we can play through them together. Money well spent in my eyes.

I was curious about the game and I have to say that our first game just blew our minds. Great story telling with simple rules and so far the best "choose your own adventure" board game I ever played. Yes, there is a little controversy with re-play but I find those several hours of game totally worth it. If you like story telling games but don't have enough time for RGPs, this is definitely a game you should try. ;-)

Basically a glorified chose your own adventure book. Illustrations are great, components functional and good looking except for the useless insert. (Supposed to hold a saved game, but not really useful for that purpose). The game includes only one scenario, more have to be bought extra. Took us three attempts to solve this case, because we ran into each possible dead end. These dead ends are pretty frustrating because they burn a lot of valuable time and do not yield much entertainment.

RATING: 6.5
This is a hard game to describe, in part because there really isn't a comparable tabletop game that I can think of... the closest analogues are probably video games like Resident Evil, or Nintendo DS puzzle games like Professor Layton or Phoenix Wright, mixed with the movie Groundhog Day.  And the TV show Quantum Leap ("Oh, boy...").  

Basically, the game comes with a single story scenario that players will play through, again and again, until they complete it within the time allotted.  Some clues you learn will become consistent changes in future tries at the scenario, though, so it's not like you're just playing the exact thing over and over.  The telling of the story evolves (or at least streamlines) to prevent becoming stale on subsequent attempts.

It really is incredibly unique and innovative, and full of great characters and loads of style.  Once you've finished a scenario, though, there's really no replayability, but future expansions providing all new scenarios are already in the works.

I do have two critiques, though.  One is that it's over-produced.  It has a superfluous board and seems to include more tokens than necessary.  For a game with such low replayability, and one that necessarily puts you on the expansion treadmill, it'd be nice if they made the package smaller and with a lower price tag.

My other critique is that it's an awkward and fairly artificial rule that explored cards cannot be read aloud to members of the group who occupy other spaces in the same location, but can relay the gist of the content.  I see no purpose to this rule.

I guess I have a third and fourth critique in that its replay value is incredibly limited, especially if you happen to sprint through the scenario.  But I don't personally own the game, so haven't paid the over-inflated price, so critiques about replayability and value don't apply to me so much.

UPDATE: The more I play, the more I'm wanting to smash the clock radio to stop the Sonny and Cher...

RATING: 7
I like the Groundhog day/Edge of tomorrow-mechanic this game is using. I like the way this game combines board and role playing games. It really captures some of the mood from the good old days in the dungeon (when there was time for days). But there is one big question that spoiled gameplay a bit. Do you play with the mindset of the host your time agent occupies or do you play with the mindset of the time agent from the future? I tried to play schizophrenically. With both mindsets being stuck in one body. The girl prone to panic attacks, clinging to anyone with her, still with the time agent around knowing that he's here on a mission and trying to focus on that. But this is a very hard thing to keep up and the atmosphere of the game mostly depends on the willingness and the talent of your group to get the inner actor to the surface. That's why I rate it as a 7 "only".

With only one scenario included in the box, there will be a lot of debate over whether it's worth the asking price. For me, the Asylum scenario was fresh and fun, and I can't wait to continue my TIME Stories adventures.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm not completely sure how to rate this. The scenario that comes with the base set, Asylum, is just okay. I might give  a 5 to that scenario alone. However, the first expansion scenario, The Marcy Case, is excellent. Even though The Marcy Case came out at the same time as the base game, I imagine it was actually developed after the base scenario. It feels like they improved on almost everything that was wrong with Asylum.

About the actual game: it's a pretty clever choose-your-own adventure game. The mechanics are simple enough to let players stay focused on the adventure. You move around from location to location, have encounters that mainly have you test your stats by rolling dice (Arkham/Eldritch Horror style), and try to solve the case before running out of time.

My only real issue is with the price. I didn't mind paying $50 for Pandemic Legacy because I got about 18 hours of gameplay out of it, and it was an awesome experience. Even though it can't be replayed, the price seemed in line with the experience and amount of time. With TIME Stories, it seems like each case can take around 2.5-4.5 hours and they really can't be replayed once completed. At $20 per expansion case, this seems excessive and I'm not sure that it will be worth keeping for that price.

And just for the record, on the Pandemic Legacy vs TIME Stories debate, I'm definitely on the side of PL.

Overall a fun experience but I'm just not sure if it will be worth the cost in the long run.

Our first hobby board game. You know what they say about your first. But, honestly, this game is probably one of the best games I have ever played. Extremely immersive, story-driven co-op. It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book brought to life. Keep a note pad handy. :)

The only real flaw, in my opinion, is the replayability factor for a single scenario. Once you've completed an entire scenario, that's pretty much it. You'll have to purchase an expansion for a new experience. HOWEVER... if you take significant time away from the game, it is possible to replay old scenarios with new players and almost have the "new game" experience. Unless you have an ironclad memory.

The initial deck that came with the game was superb. I like the puzzle solving, I enjoy having to communicate to actually get things done. Artwork is superb, and the flavor text is top notch. 

I look forward to playing through the other expansions.

RATING: 6
Full of interesting ideas and brimming with surprises, marred by piss-poor actual writing. This is not a problem unique to T.I.M.E. Stories - many board games struggle with plot and character development - but in a game where storytelling is so critical to the core pitch, it's a killer. The expansions that I've played (The Marcy Case and Lumen Fidei) don't get any better in this regard. It's a lot of cliches followed by a resounding "well, I guess it's over?"

To its credit, the puzzle-solving elements of T.I.M.E. Stories can be exceptionally clever, and the base game does this best. It's just a shame it ultimately feels like a third-rate adventure game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
T.I.M.E. Stories is one of the more unusual games to come out in recent years. It plays like a card game version of a PC point and click adventure or Adventure Gamebook. You collect items as the plot progresses and some of them open up other locations. Each 'item' and 'location' card has the potential to change or amend the gameplay in ways beyond those which you expect. The storyline to the first adventure is really good too, just my thing actually. The components are top notch too. Not sure if it was first game learning curve or my general ineptitude but I failed in my mission! Despite this it was a brilliant experience though and you can go back in! Some cards stay in place but most are reset so you can get a second chance at the adventure with the added bonus of knowing where to/not to go/do. I'm going to give it  a few weeks before my next attempt. A great solo experience.

For me this game was all bark, no bite. It was, and continues to be, seriously over-hyped in my opinion. There is very little in the way of actual "game" here. Hoping the expansion will add much more depth.

I played the base and the Marcy Case and while at times I was very intrigued I feel that something is missing here.  

The design of the stories lacks a couple gears that could take it to another level.  The stories are a little basic and lack a bit of depth.  The different paths feel a little too perfect or imperfect.

I guess what I am trying to say is that at times this is interesting, but both cases seemed to leave my group and I unfulfilled.

I don't think we'll be back for case #3, but I'd be interested to see an evolution of this system into something with some more meat.

RATING: 4
First Impression after 4 runs:

It's less a boardgame and more an experience. Something like a (barely) interactive movie. The time track and the resets of the runs annoyed me to a great level and felt forced to make the game last longer than it should. The game can't be lost, unless you choose to, so the whole combat levels also felt ridiculously out of place. The riddles where surprisingly few, to the point of frustration. Whatever cooperation might have been required from the storytelling description I completely missed it. No meaningfull decisions for anyone playing this game. After the first couple of runs even the set up of the rooms was a tiring and tedious procedure. We didn't for example ever set up the first after the first time, we mentally travelled from it to save time.

The only thing that felt right was the artwork and the basic receptables' characters that were still completely disconnected to the rest of the story.

Overall, the first story fell flat for me, and left me wanting. Just repeating it feels completely pointless for me, even with a new group, as it wasn't that involving to create different reactions to different players. So it's a 1, normally, either from a boardgame or an rpg percpective.

The 4 is there for the other stories, as I can see this game as a decent way to tell a story to a group of people and get some nice rp reactions from them, but the story needs to be really good and the time track really thrown away to save time to add to the story. I'm willing to give this another go, even if based on the first story I have little hopes for it. 

In the end, I can't really call this a game, it feels completely out of place ranked and filed here in BGG as one just because it comes in a box. A game, any game, needs to have a goal and this one doesn't - other than to end it.

RATING: 4.3
I was so hyped about this game, and i got so disappointed.
The gameplay of this game is just mediocre. I really don't understand how people get fun with it.
I hate when in cooperative games there is no interesting decisions to do as a group.
Here we are just reading cards, and tell each other what's happening.
The dice roll it's silly.
I get into account that maybe you need to put yourself deeper into the part, maybe roleplay a bit? Probably we are not the perfect group for this kind of games.
But still, i don't get it.
There is no satisfaction in the gameplay.
Where is the GAME itself?

"It's more of an experience than a game" they say.
"Yeah, a shitty one" i answer.
Cause sure, in the end it should all comes down to the plot twists, exciting stories, and stuff like that.
That's what i hoped too...
And YEAH! Spoilers! The story is a dead flat-line, a trivial mixture of everything you could already expect.
Best part?
You will probably have to get through it couple times, doing kinda the same things again.

I would play other scenarios/stories for the sake of curiosity and to see what they made-up. But this is my vote for the base game.
In before: to people that say "you should consider it as a system where you can put lots of great stories" i answer "i'm pretty confident they won't change things enough to make me change my mind."

I failed to discover what is driving the hype for this one. Familiar RPG flavored adventure/dungeon crawl style done in a clunky way. It reminded me of playing a computer based team adventure game in which you are allowed to save your game, die, then return to the same spot to take a different path, eventually escaping the maze. Except that much of the activity here is fiddling with the components rather than playing the game. Oh, and after two or three runs through the included single scenario, you will need to buy an expansion to get a new adventure to solve.

RATING: 8
This reminds me of the old point-and-click adventure games that I used to play on the computer when I was younger. I like the meta-plot of the players being time travelers while being injected into one of many random settings. Each scenario is different from the others and offers a new puzzle to solve. Some of the scenarios are more combat focused than others. This game has so much potential and so many more historical (and future) periods to explore. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next. 

I get that the idea of having to buy each scenario doesn't appeal to everyone but I really like the system. Though, I do wish they added some more replayability to the scenarios. It's a real shame that you can't really go back and play old scenarios because you'll know the solution. Recently, I tried replaying Asylum with a friend and I had to let him do all the decision-making because I STILL (after almost 2 years) remembered a lot of the things that happened. That's also a point in the game's favour, because I still remember things from that long ago that happened in the game. Like the solution to the big puzzle in Asylum and the [redacted by Bob.]

The first half uncovering the story was brilliant, the second half just working out where to go and what to do was one of my dullest experiences in gaming.

Better on second play 5 months later when taking note of where things were and what we needed to do.

Update 01/03/2016 - Tried Marcy case, first run through much better, very enjoyable, not as many annoying restarts as in Asylum

Update 24/06/2017 - Tried Dragons, also enjoyable. We give ourselves extra time units to avoid the boring restarts.

Don't know what to say about this. I was so hyped to try it when it came out. Waited for the right moment to start the campaign with the right group. And it was exciting the first run but then... well... too repetitive and frankly a bit boring. The 8 score? Well.. I want to like this so bad. And I will give the Marcy case a shot. Maybe I will like that one better?

UPDATE: Tried Marcy case and maybe my expectations were on a better level because this time a really enjoyed it. Looking forward to more scenarios!

Great artwork, components and concept. Unfortunately, the experience is completely destroyed by bad execution. The writing on the cards (a key part of the game) is terrible, there is no motivation for the plot, and the game creates zero tension or compelling narrative. To put the nail in the coffin, the primary mechanic, time loops, has absolutely no meaning other than the confound the players and lengthen gameplay artificially in the name of "theme."

Tried it at 2p, in spite of its reputation at that player count. Tried Rahdo's 2p variant, which seemed a good approach. But it wasn't fun for me; we gave it up without ever even solving the first case. Three sessions, just gave up in the middle of the third as not having fun. For a co-op puzzle experience, we'll choose the exit-room-style games. We're not much on co-op games anyway; I tried this one because we got it cheap. This one felt EXACTLY like SU&SD portray it in their review video--repetitive (very) and frustrating.

The dice rolling for combat and skill checks just felt really out of place.  Like it was just wasting our time.  Oh we didn't succeed. okay. Spend some more time units and try again.  Then if you run out of time units replay the whole thing.  Just felt like it was wasting our time.  Once I know the story the game play isn't interesting to me.  We just played it once straight through.  About halfway through we decided to ignore skill checks and time units.  Puzzle at the end was the best part.  Overall the story was too short and I really dislike the die rolling action resolution aspect of it.

I really don't know how to rate this one. I had a ton of fun playing it, but once you've beaten it, there's literally no reason to ever pick it up again. Using strictly BGG's rating suggestion, I'd have to rate it a 2 or 3. But based on the amount of fun I had while playing it, I'd give it a 7.75.

You get ~3 plays out of it. After that you sell it or buy expansions. I've yet to play a game that has less replay value after completing it. Maybe a Legacy game?  But you get far more plays out of those.

Too much random, not enough puzzles and not enough time to complete the game, too ambiguous to know where to go... I feel that you can't really have "good runs" by thinking, it's more about luck. Repeating the same story over is quickly boring because the scenario is not really good and the scoring system is totaly irrelevant. The art is pretty good, but some cards feel awkward, like something's been added after.

To finish, the game is way too expensive for what it is, not a lot of materials and no replayability. I'll try another expansion (hopefully I can just borrow it, won't buy) and just hope the story's better.

So this game is really cool-- in concept and in gameplay.  So why the low score?  Because there's zero reason to ever play this game more than once.

If the base game cost $30 and expansions were released every 1-3 months for $10, it would be worth it, but the game is $50 and expansions are $30.  

No.  Just no.

Certainly not a fan of the pricing/sales model, but we'll ignore that for my rating.

An enjoyable enough cooperative choose-your-own-adventure book.  The 'game' aspects are pretty minor and uninteresting but don't get in the way, and the decisions are generally arbitrary but the journey is still fun.  Story was somewhat interesting, writing wasn't anything noteworthy.  Available options and paths are generally well-executed.

The scoring measure is somewhat nonsensical, as you can get a lower score by doing better.

The system itself gets a straight 10 from me. It's innovativ, fun and easy to learn. The level of immersion is great!

The "Asylum" case however left us a bit underwhelmed. It only gets a 7 from me. (See below for more). I really hope other cases are stronger, the system deserves it!


----SPOILER WARNING!!!!-----

Our biggest problem with the asylum case was, that the solution lies in simply going everywhere and pick up everything that you can. Many of the Pentagrams where just conveniently lying around somewhere where they had no business of being. We felt reminded of many of the weaker point and click adventures in computer games. There where no decisions on "where to go next" that could be based on anything. You just had to try everything and only repeat meaningful stuff next time.
Seccond problem: We had a very frustrating stretch, where we went into the Catacombs (lots of fighting). Then stand before the final gate without all Pentagrams (no way of solving) so we went on through the only other way out (lots more fighting, one of us dying) only to end up at a dead end with about 15 time wasted on absolutely nothing...
Comme on guys! You don't do that to players! At least let us find something interesting at the end of this. No Role-play master would let his players suffer this hard. The mood at the table was at an absolute low point, especially since it was the 3. run, so we could not just let it end and try again. We all knew we just screwed our scoring significantly. We ended up having 7 Points which is probably alright. The mood lightened in the second half of the run, but we never really came back from this.

This game is visually stunning, and the stories are rather captivating.  I can see why it is highly rated.  

I think anyone can appreciate, however, that there is a limited number of times that you can play the base game and enjoy it.

Personally, I despise story games.  I knew I wouldn't like it before starting, but played anyway so that I have sufficient knowledge of the game.

My rating takes into account my preference against this type of game.  If I rated it entirely on my preference, it would be a 0 (it's my least favorite type of game).  If I rated it completely on the quality, I'd put it around 7.5.   The rating I chose (4) is fairly close to the middle of that.

Only reason it only gets 9.5 is because replayability is too low for the cost. The playtime is high quality but also expensive as hell. Even if price may be justified by high design-cost vs low sales volume I still feel like I'm getting ripped off... But hey, FFG has been preparing me for this for a long time, I'll just enjoy the ride :)

Stuck in a loop - the game. Interesting concept, good artwork. However, the gameplay lacks in major resorts, which makes it rather tedious to play. Official box comes with but a single adventure, which has no replay value whatsoever.

RATING: 8
Very unique "game", very thematic, very exciting to discover, but the implementation of the first scenario left me a bit disapointed; hopefully next scenarios deliver a better finish

[+] cool theme, sandbox game with scenarios that can go in all kinds of directions, the mechanic is quiet simple and game flows well, curious to see more
[-] skill resolution is luck driven with very few ways to mitigate it, seems that you have to "check" every card not to miss anything

=> initial rating 7 (very unique game with potential to be great)


rating for Asylum scenario: 6
[+] interesting variety of receptacle, but...
[-] unclear objective and confusing rule for 3rd run; too many "dead ends" that you can not avoid; you pretty much have to "try" every locations, so in the end there is only one path to victory; the puzzle sucks! the setting is cool but the mystical/paranormal creatures come out of the blue


UP: enjoyed Marcy Case more, but still have that feeling that you don't really make informed or meaningful decisions. Basically to "solve" the scenario, you have to check every card, because any one of those card can hide a "key" part of the solution, and there is no way to tell beforehand if a card will be a "key" or a waste of time (fight or stupid time consumption)


UP: enjoyed Prophecy of Dragons (more than Asylum, less than Marcy Case), there were more choices but ultimately this one felt too easy (maybe we were lucky, but unfortunately we probably won't revisit it)


UP: loved Under the Mask (my favorite as of now), many paths to follow with no dead-ends, right amount of investigation vs combat/puzzles and great receptacle mechanic (hope it's reused in following scenarios)
=> increased rating to 8


UP: very disappointed by Expedition: Endurance (the worst scenario), a useless first run, a single path to follow, obvious false leads, an uninspired super-easy end scene, overall a weird theme


UP: pleasantly surprised by the level of overarching story-telling from Lumen Fidei, the scenario has a few very good moments; really looking forward to the implications of our "result" over the next scenarios

UP: loved the 3-tiered nature of Estrella drive, as well as the more adult content; I still wished there were implications from the previous mission

RATING: 7
Based on 1st scenario: Fun and Unique and filled to the brim with theme. The first 2/3 of the game was a blast but that last 1/3 was a slog where we didnt feel any closer to solving the mystery and the ending was a little bit anticlimactic. Based on our group, DON'T play this game late at night and tired. We solved the last riddle but didn't realize it for another pain inducing 20 minutes. Also the combat felt fiddly and in the way more than it added to the experience.

  
Still though 3 out of the 4 people including myself enjoyed it and want to try they next case.

The base game can be done better... i.e. I don't like this abstract "symbols" that we collect and have to remember... Our team need to remember that we need "two yellow" and "three blue" to collect "one green".... and if we collected "four green" we won the game... bleh

This is a hard game to rate. As a role-player as well as board gamer, I had an fantastic time playing the first scenario. However, it does NOT hold up as a board game, since you can literally only played each scenario once (since it is are not randomized in any way between play times).
I'll give it a 6 since it's a 10/10 as a experience, or lightway RPG-scenario, but it's not good as a board game (which it is marketed as). All in all, if you want to have a fantastic story-telling, RPG-like experience, you will not regret it. Just make sure everybody knows that they should expect that, and not a proper board game.

A very cool premise that provided an experience that felt pretty unique amongst the other games out there.

RATING: 5
T.I.M.E. Stories is the cardboard equivalent of an 80's era point-and-click PC adventure game. This is a story that's completely on rails, the gameplay simply being multiple passes at turn left or turn right type decisions until you find the right path or are lucky enough to roll the right dice to proceed.

That's not to say that it is not a neat experience. It follows the format of most adventure games, with a paragraph of text being read as the players enter each location or flip a surprise event. In a nice flourish of immersion, the text that is being read is also accompanied by an interesting illustration of the scene, painted mural style across the back of the other cards players are about to interact with at that location. It really pulls you into the story and makes planning the team's actions a much more interactive experience as the players debate the risk and rewards of interacting with the dangers presented in the artwork.

While the game pulls off all of the best parts of those point-and-clicks, it also suffers from some of the less interesting parts of those games. Exploration is great, but when you have to replay a scene it becomes a largely uninteresting exercise of retracing and repeating puzzles you've already solved. There is also zero replayability once you've completed an adventure since they are essentially a simple maze of encounters where the correct path is nigh impossible to forget, once you've found the answer.

If this were a 20 or 30-hour game, this would be much less of a concern. Unfortunately, it only takes 2-4 hours to run through the base scenario which isn't a whole lot of bang for your $50 buy-in. The expansions are significantly less expensive, but again, even at $25 or so, I'm not sure the value is there for the single session of play it delivers. Honestly, I'm not even sure the money is as much of a factor for me as the shelf space. Once you've collected a half dozen scenarios, this thing is taking up a whole shelf and you are storing things you can never use again!

This is probably a good investment for someone that has both a lot of traffic through their game room and an urge to watch other people play their game since they can no longer play it themselves. That certainly isn't me, so i'll happily play some more adventures, but I certainly won't be buying into the system.

As temporal agents, you will be sent into different worlds, times or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you.
Consists of scenarios, which define the rules and theme of the game.
You explore the world consisting of beautiful cards together, you can solve puzzles, fight monsters and make tough decisions.
Its a race against time, and if you run out, you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.

I hugely enjoyed TIME Stories: Asylum (base game) and $10 per person for 3-4 hours of gaming is worth it if you like "escape the room"-type puzzle solving. If you think of this as an investment into the TIME Stories series, however, you may become quickly disappointed. The card-centric framework shows its clear limitations in the Marcy Case expansion. I think MoM:2nd ed. with its powerful app offers a better base for co-op experience than TIME stories.

I have never had a more interesting, engaging, or entertaining experience playing any board game ever.  This game is a mystery-a puzzle-and an unforgiving one.  It is not linear.  It is a beautiful way to spend an afternoon. Any expansion plays will be counted here and the games will not be listed separately.  

We have played four expansions now and we love it. This is feeling more and more like a roleplaying game campaign. The story and mysteries unfold after each session. It is still a great experience.

Since the story driven aspect guarantees limited replayability, T.I.M.E Stories falls in the category of games like Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective that are more about the experience and stories generated from said experience than the actual game itself.

after two run at Asylum: it's very well made, just not my kind of game.
The problems I have are:
 - not so many interesting decisions to take. It seems too scripted and constrained
 - quite expensive. Compare it, for instance, with Pandemic Legacy where at least you will play, on average, 18 games with the expenditure of the first box.

The nice thing is the theme and how well it fits in what you are actually doing. Also the characters have plausible characteristics

This is a poor "game", but it somehow still felt obligated to tack on its game mechanics even when they hindered the experience. Each story could make a reasonable 2 hour video game in the vein of a Telltale Games episode.  Replaying runs after losing to factors outside of player control seems to exist only to justify the price for two hours of content with no replayability. The nature of the adventure gameplay doesn't add tension to the mystery but only tests player patience.

RATING: N/A
I can see why this game appeals to both Euro gamers and Amerithrashers. As a Eurogamer, I think it has a lot of potential but the plot of the first episode is just another run of the mill Lovecraftian story, which to me is very disappointing because there are already plenty of games like that. My squad gave up after the third run because we didn't want to go through the whole thing from scratch again. As in all Amerithrash games, rolling badly is something that's beyond your control, and for me it spoils the fun. I will give the second scenario an honest chance and then decide if I want to keep the game.

I'm a prime target for TIME Stories, in that I loved the Infocom interactive fiction games in my youth - to the point where I [url=http://ifdb.tads.org/search?searchfor=author%3ACody+Sandifer]wrote a few decently-reviewed IF games myself[/url] in the late 90s.

Do old-timey text adventures still hold up today?  Sometimes.  Adventures with intricately timed puzzles were the most frustrating to play, and TIME Stories is exactly that type of game.  (So was my own [url=http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=nzydrfu1rl2qkuop]Zero Sum Game[/url], and ironically if I could reverse time and change that aspect of ZSG I probably would.)  But time-limited puzzles did pose an interesting challenge, and they were always satisfying to beat.  Or not, and you threw up your hands in disgust and stopped playing.

One issue particular to TIME Stories is that the game is meant to be played exactly once, so everything about it needs to be perfect: rules, mechanics, presentation, all-around fairness, and internal consistency.  (By the latter, I mean that, if I'm not allowed to search a bush in one room, I shouldn't need to search a bush in another room to solve a puzzle - that wouldn't be consistent, since based on prior experience I would assume that wouldn't be possible.)

It's not clear to me that the central puzzle in TIME Stories is fair. Not because it isn't properly clued, but because the interface itself is wonky.  We were baffled at one point because (a) we didn't know if we had sufficient information to solve the puzzle (we did, it turned out) and (b) it was unclear how we would know if the puzzle was even solved. I think that's a problem that should have been addressed in playtesting, though I'm not sure how.  Unfortunately, this means the game fails the 'perfection' test, and it does so in such a way that it can potentially be ruined - or at least repeated to the point of frustration - unless you decide to hunt down a spoiler-free FAQ (which shouldn't be necessary).

Finally, the one-and-done play model is financially annoying in the extreme.  You either need a sugar daddy with cash to burn, or all players bite the bullet and chip in a few bucks for the privilege of playing.  Then perhaps you pay the game forward and let some other group enjoy the experience.

In my case, I'm glad that I played someone else's copy, and I would be happy to try others in the series.  There's no way I would fork out the cash myself, though.

Not all the rules are explained properly. The game itself is not that amazing as I thought it would be. The high rating comes from the experience that I had with my friends. I guess the game did deliver nice amount of fun and interest (for the very short time though), enough for me to rate it 8. Although, at the same time, it kind of left me with the feeling of disappointment. I was expecting something else and I think the brilliant idea of the game wasn't executed in the best way it could. 
The puzzles were interesting but rather easy and not enough of them. I guess the game has to appeal to larger audience so they can't be too hard.
I think the scenario should be way longer and the time progression should be a little more lenient. I feel like they were too lazy to make the game longer so instead of that, they made the time token progress extremely fast so that it would be impossible to get to the end on your 1st or 2nd try (unless we were moving the time token too much because of the badly written instruction manual; we ran out of time after only a few locations with not throughout exploration) unless you know the exact, shortest path to victory. So what we ended up with is a short game with a little bit stressful (in negative way) rush coupled with artificial optimization of your moves with each consecutive play. (Your final playthrough of the game is going to be dull, almost giving you the feeling of setting up a game rather than playing it)

In an essance it's like a worse version of PC RPG game, however, with an advantage that you can play it with your friends over the table with the best possible interaction and cooperation.
Also, the story of the first scenario is really flat. The game doesn't give you any details of the story (lazily telling you that it is your job to discover what is going on - although I guess it's ok). It starts mysterious and intriguing but suddenly the plot becomes really weird and shallow. The ending was really disappointing.

Overall, worth playing, great experience, but the idea wasn't executed too well. The game is extremely luck dependent, majorly flawed, and heavily overpriced.

Goddammit!  The insert is torn to shreds before I even play the game.  SO ANNOYING.  This also exposed a series of spoilers.  Lovely.  Two things in one: this is a system and the Asylum module.  As a system, my impression is this is good, but pretty imperfect.

As a module, Asylum was good.  Interesting and beautiful, but confusing and marred by really SHIT rules.  Ultimately, there was a great deal of missing story, the main puzzle was WAY easier than it should have been, and the ending was essentially absent.  I hate a bad manual and although this one is beautiful, it IS bad.  We had fun, but this took more "filling in and fixing the blanks" than Arkham Horror and that was my previous standard for an inspired but broken/incomplete game.

The story is amazing in this game. It all makes sense at some point, which is great. However, it was a bit tedious searching the stack of cards for the locations, trying to figure out how to reveal hidden things in some locations, then dying or running  out of time and having to reset the entire scenario. If I were to play again I would want to just ignore the time track and play through the story because the story is really that good. Unfortunately at that point it's pretty much a choose your own adventure book and not a very interesting game.

This game delivers (for me at least) something similar to Pandemic Legacy. 

It´s like watching a movie where you make the decisions of the actors. 

Great art, good stories, and easy mechanics. Maybe not the game for everybody, but if you like "role playing" the characters and the story a little this games is excellent.

Have played all available cases 2 player. I'm leaning towards disliking this game after playing the Marcy case. You buy limited content and the way the game plays out you are punished for wanting to explore it all. The die roll when changing scenes is too random (losing 3 TUs is a lot) - the combat is mind numbing. For all the accolades this game has received I found the story to be second rate (the Marcy case was barely a story at all just a hotchpotch of derivative zombie tropes). I did enjoy the puzzle in Asylum - I thought that was clever and it felt good to solve it. Under the MAsk was a bit of a return to form but this game will need to realise it's potential more for me to stay invested.

interesting co-op with a semi-linear storyline... kind of a choose-your-own-adventure game, but co-op and with some dice mechanics... mechanically light, but heavy on theme... I liked it, but I don't need to own it (I have only played The Marcy Case)

My first play of The Asylum mission in the base game of T.I.M.E Stories is definitely one of my most enjoyable, thrilling, and gripping game sessions of my life. This is a game custom made for me. I don't really care that you can only really play each case once, because to me it was well worth the investment. If every game session was as much fun as this, then I'd easily plunk down $50 each game night (I sort of do that already though).

I've been a roleplayer for over 30 years, but sadly very rarely in the role of a player character, instead taking on the role of a gamemaster. T.I.M.E Stories feels like a beautiful, and perfect marriage of an RPG, and a cooperative board game. The deck in this "decksploration" game acts as the gamemaster, and the players very much have to cooperate to figure out the enigma, and successfully complete their mission.

The theme of time travel is one I adore, and it's such a smart choice for this game, as you can play the same time traveler, you, each time, but in another receptacle. Fantastic!

If you're a board gamer, or table top RPG player you owe it to yourself to experience T.I.M.E Stories.

RATING: 9
I don't know how to rate TIME Stories.  A 10 was tempting based on the high points... but we were ready to throw it out the window in frustration at another point so this seems about right.

The theme being sort of like Quantum Leap but on a team of Navy Seals is neat.  Playing the game feels a lot like a Choose Your Own Adventure book where you are trying to find one specific ending... or a bit like the computer game Myst with a lot more violence.  

I think I like the first time into a mission the best as everything is new and you are feeling out both the setting and the puzzle/mystery you are trying to solve.  Once you've gone through the first iteration or two you probably have a good idea what you need to accomplish and are trying to find the most efficient way to achieve your task.  This is interesting in its own right but a lot of the efficiency comes down to die rolls and being clever enough to solve the puzzle set before you.  The elation of solving that puzzle is pretty great... but feeling completely stumped (or needing to brute force a solution through multiple trips through time) can be frustratingly unfun.  

It is also fair to say this does not have the replay value of a typical game.  I think diving into each new mission will always be fun... but a mission you played is going to need to sit for 6 months... or a year... or more... before you play it again in hopes that you've forgotten the exact details to make the puzzle fresh again, just like reading a mystery book a second time.

For now I'm very much looking forward to the next mission packs and solving those new puzzles with my friends.

So good, and such a well executed idea. I've had my group complain that having to go through the same rooms again and again can get repetitive, and while this is probably the only downfall of the game, besides the difficulty in replayability, everything about the game around that is superb and absolutely surprising. Cannot wait for the next two slated expansions in December and February!

EDIT: Still a neat game, but I've lost a lot of interest in playing it anymore. I hate the three run throughs you basically NEED to do if you want to complete it. In fact, having a forced restart is kind of the worst thing. Great ideas, but I don't feel the execution like I once did.

I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this. Even after all of the hype, and the fact that I greatly prefer chunky Euros, this game was a blast to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I do not understand the hype at all: 

1) you don´t do anything in this game besides picking random location spots trial-and-error style, there is absolutely 0 skill involved. 2) this game is supposed to be full of puzzles when actually it is not. there is exactly one puzzle, which cannot be solved if you haven´t collected all the pieces and if you have, it is not that hard at all. 3) the theme is abysmal. why are we fighting creatures? this scenario takes place in our timeline, so fighting fantasy creatures in a dungeon again makes no sense. 4) the game feels boring and random. to be honest, nobody in our gaming group had the feeling of playing a game, it was just random card flipping and reading.

=> I expected to love this game, but it disappointed me like no game before

An interesting take on a mystery game.  Difficult to solve initially, the game mechanics allow for replay to continue to develop a sense of the world and find clues to work towards the solution.  I truly enjoyed the sense of exploration and detective work while trying to riddle out the solution.  I would highly recommend taking written notes while playing, however, especially if you don't intend to beat the entire mission in a single sitting.

i thought it was fun the first playthrough, but the repeated play-throughs and the annoyance of the final puzzle put this on a 'not interested in ever playing' again level. I just didn't think it was fun the second and third time through, and was really annoyed to find out that the entire game is basically worthless without dumping a ton more money into it.

But the Marcy case really gave a different taste.

OK game.  Most games derive their enjoyment based on who you play with.  This game more so since once you finish it, the replay value is next to nonexistent.  Choose your gaming partners wisely with this title.

First play, 3p:

- Great theme, even if the objective isn't clearer. [i]"Advance, advance, advance!"[/i]
- Combat is pretty standard.
- Not much replayability other than playing the same scenario with different characters.
- Ultimately I fear it might be an overcooked game of concentration.
- Great for this player count.

With Marcy Case and Prophecy of Dragons. Played through first 3 scenarios with Sarah, Eric, & Lauren. Ended with 1 purple  (extra die) and 2 pink (instant kill) beacons. Also recovered the parts of the hypercube from Asylum and Prophecy of Dragons. Probably quitting at this point because Sarah does not like the game. Likely will lend out my copy to people that I know.

Played through the scenario that comes in the game in around 3 hours. 

I love the mechanics and setting, and the way an adventure game is implemented in card form, but the game needed much better writing.

The game's ostensibly about time travel, but in practice it feels like exploring a setting that's got nothing to do with the sci-fi premise, on a time limit. The characters aren't explored in any great detail, and there's a lot of fluff around the idea of a deep mystery that doesn't really work out to anything meaningful.

It's frustrating to think that someone paid $50 for this. We figured that all the chits are multipurpose, so they can probably print an expansion that's just a deck of cards and charge $10 or so - but nope! The expansion is $30!

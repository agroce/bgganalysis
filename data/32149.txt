Fun for a party game. I just don't like party games all that much. Also, the tiles are pretty small, which is not so good for people with bad eyes (like my stepmom).

This is a great game.  kind of like all play pictionary but with a pile of words you use instead of drawing.  I like it better than Pictionary because the all play is great and there's no artism required. 
 You have to think of a way to use random word tiles together to get the answer.

I really like this game.   It is such a simple and obvious design really... just a bunch of words written on pieces of paper, but it comes across as a fun team game.

Oct 2014:  Rating up to a 10.  It amazes me how much everyone we play this with loves the game.  Our extended group of non-gamer friends ask for this one all the time.  It scales well from 4 players all the way up to 10 or so.  Simply the best word game out there.

Adding screens so that each team cant see each other's words makes the game far more competitive and interesting.  Also, allowing players to whisper to the clue giver reduces the issue of a team just listening to what the other team is shouting out and guessing.

Wow, that's a lot of parts.  900 word tiles.  Amazing.  There is plenty of opportunity for cleverness, but the game can be very hard to work with; sometimes you find the words you need, sometimes you don't.  You can't depend upon finding a specific word, because with 900, you just may not be able to find it, so you have to be very flexible.

An interesting card game that can be fun with the right people.  Larger groups are probably best - say 3 teams of 3 would be ideal.

The one frustrating thing about a game like this is that if both you and your opponent come up with the same concept to describe the target word, it is a mad dash to be the first person to find one particular word.  Other than that, it is a good, if not demanding, word-based party game.

Word Blur is a light game which can take from 4 up to 16 players, and plays well with any number in between.

The key is not to look for one word you know is in there (though sometimes you want to), but to use what you can find.

Looks like it should be fun, but it seems to play a lot slower than you really want it to be.  But in large part this was due to the group and the attitude of the group that played.

This is a fun game, but quite difficult.  You have to find words that help you, but there are a lot of words that don't.  Of course, the fun part of the game is how, as you play it, your sense of what is helpful widens.  It is the sort of game that creates fun memories, like that time someone played "East Human" and someone correctly guessed "Buddha" right away.  

The mechanic where both teams go at once and try not to look at each others hints is a bit awkward, especially since you can hear what the other team is guessing.  I tend to shout out random things in addition to my actual guessed to avoid helping them too much, but I can't help but think they could have come up with a better mechanic than this.

Pretty fun but everyone agreed that it's annoying that some tiles are the same as the mystery words.   For example, for the mystery word "secret" there is an actual tile named "secret" (ditto for "business" "card" and "white" "house").  So rather than guessing based on clever clues, the round is won by someone who finds those tiles.  I think we'll play that you can't use a word from the guess pile that's also part of the mystery word(s).

Update 12/31/11:  Played this again to give it another shot after receiving a trade offer for it.  After a slow start, the game became more agreeable to the partygoers.  I played in the first three, but family and friends continued to play it after I'd moved on to other games.  May have to rethink this status...

1/2/08:  Lots and lots of chits, and I'm so glad I didn't have to punch/cut them out myself.  Parents and wife liked this - good party game combining charades and pictionary (but with words).  Fast paced, but limits itself in that a team must be able to crowd around and see what the clue giver is doing, yet the clue giver must be close enough to identify and grab tiles.

Oh, the creativity and laughter.  Take magnetic poetry and turn it into a game!  Searching through all the words to find just what you need can be frustrating at times, but that's part of the tension of the game.  Two teams of 3 looks to be one of the best ways to play.  Good party game.

RATING: 7
Competitive magnetic poetry race. Amazing when it's a game of creativity and lateral thinking, not so much when it comes down to who finds the word "food" in the pile first.

The rules as written allow for gesturing when a teammate guesses something close to the right answer. This makes the game less fun and I would recommend telling cluegivers to remain impassive, sort of like in Codenames.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good party game.  It can be a little frustrating though when the player the is selecting words is struggling to find words and the other teammates are waiting.  I think that they then have to pay attention to what the other team is saying and gestures from the other teams clue/word finder.

RATING: 8
Great fun, especially in larger groups!  Especially good for groups incorporating non-gamers, IMHO; anyone can easily learn the rules and have a good time playing.  I can see this getting heavy play at parties and other large gatherings.

This has been coming out a lot at CABS recently (early 2008), for some unknown reason.  Success at this game is all about finding the right tiles, or making do with what you've got when the right tiles elude you.  Update: we almost always play with teams of 3 or 4 instead of pairs.  It's usually two teams, but sometimes three.  I think it's better having fewer teams with more players, because if one player doesn't pick up on the train of thought of the clue-giver, somebody else on the team might.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this game.  The number of little tiles is almost ridiculous, it can be overwhelming.  But the way that you can position them next to the board for added clarity is a neat idea and it is cool when it all comes together.  But sometimes it seems to drag, definitely draining the fun out of it.  I'm not sure we played by the official rules.  We played that both teams were racing to say the same word, which is what makes sense to me.  In other games we've played, having variable objectives sucks out the competition and fun.

Played twice to 20 points (instead of the recommended 10 since a game would be over so quickly otherwise) with two teams of five pitted against each other.  Each team has one person seeking to describe a word on a card using only some of the 900 different words printed on tiny cardboard chits spread all over the table.  No talking is allowed although we ended up allowing gestures to emphasize when someone was close to an answer.  We ended up having each team pursuing different words instead of both teams pursuing the same answer/word so as to prevent the opposing team from just making guesses off of what the other team was guessing.  Our group had a blast as we alternated teasing each other wondering how we were supposed to make some connections!  Some expressed a little bit of frustration about the time spent searching almost 1000 tiny chits of words for specific words that could be connected to the subject/answer.

RATING: 7
Cute party game in which you try to communicate with your partners by putting down various words that in some way convey the idea of the secret word.  I enjoyed and feel it's fun with the right crowd but it feels like it could wear out its welcome pretty fast.  A party game that I would generally be willing play but probably will never really desire to play.

I love quick thinking party games, and word blur is one of the best there is. It might actually be the only word game on this list (except for Codenames, of course), and it's definitely one of the most fun. I love the way that you can respond to the types of words that people are guessing and steer them in the right direction or back them off of the wrong one in a way that most other games like this can't accommodate. Now if I could only find a copy...

A really fun little "guess-the-word" party game.  Very simple to get right into, and great for some good laughs.  Absolutely no down-time as each person is either guessing or giving hints on every turn.  Design was well thought-out.  The "modifier" strips are fun to work with and help a lot with forming some good hints.  The fact that the word tiles have the word on each side was a VERY good (and necessary) idea.  Just dump them on the table, spread them out, and you're good to go.  I'm impressed with the game and look forward to playing it more.

UPDATE: We have just been having TOO much fun with this.  I gotta raise my rating to a 10!  Last night our team guessed "dairy" from the hint "mammal pump", and we had the biggest laughs trying to get "programmer" by pushing the words "pull, crime, war" up to the "sounds like" modifier.  The highlight was for the word "dictionary" when I simply scooped up about 50 words and slid them into the hint area... we got it in about 2 seconds!

I haven't played this nearly as much as I'd like.  It's a very fun word game. You pick words from a common pile to try and get your partner to guess the word from a clue. Every time I've played there's been stories and a call for another game afterwards.

Word Blur -- Played once; four-player.  Sounded more fun than it played.  We had some disputes over the rules regarding "sounds like" versus "starts with".  In a game with so little substance, there's no room for such disputes.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable. First few games should be played with using an automatic dice roll of "1", and both sides working on the same word until everyone gets the hang of it. Very enjoyable for many ages.

Having to glance through 900 words for clues can be slow. Word tiles are double-sided and in a reasonably large font (although you'll probably want the word chooser to be sitting in the middle).

Another way we play is have every draw a card and work on a clue while also trying to guess everyone else's. Give a point for each card you guess, and give points for the order in which your word is guessed.

The one downside of this game is when someone can't seem to get their word guessed, and they hunt and hunt and can't seem to find the clue word(s) they want.

This may be the best party game ever if (ok, big if) you have a large group of smart/literate people and a really long table.  Every year we do a big New Years games party and the crowd is really mixed (middle schoolers, seniors, hard core gamers, interested newbies).  Each time we've played this, it's been amazing.  People say "OMG, that's impossibly hard" but then the word always gets guessed.  Lots of creativity and teamwork gets brought to bear and it's fun to be trying to look at one display while listening to the guesses the other elicits.

I started out thinking the game was OK but it really got good after we played several times.  The other day we had a group of people over recently for the UFC fights as we always do and this game really worked out great.  I was able to explain the rules and do an example puzzle in about 30 seconds.    After that we played a few rounds till the fights started took a break while a fight was going but would play a round or 2 in between rounds or between fights.  I think that is a real plus for the game is that it works for real parties where people want to socialize and do other things in addition to being focused on a game.  We were able to play a quick round laugh about the puzzle or the rediculous guesses then do another. 

The rules say that teams should not look at each others puzzles.  Not only were we looking at each others puzzles we were stealing each others words from the puzzles.  By the end of the night we had a rule going were it was fair to steal a word if the description you were using contained more words than the original description.

Long story short. Played the game with a bunch of non-gamers, they want to play next time they come over which sounds good to me.

Fun fun fun. This is a word game for folks who don't particularly like word games. Rather, this is a word association game rather than a word game itself ala Scrabble. Despite the frenzy and imbalance and luck, this is aparty game at heart and can be a hoot with the right crowd. That said, some players are clearly better than others in forming these associations... play this game with more people

I created the game, so I'm biased, but I wouldn't have spent my life's savings to publish it if I didn't rank it at least a 9 or 10.  

I love this game for a few reasons: 1) it really keeps peoples' interest, and it's pretty addicting.  2) There's a lot of creativity involved.  The more flexible you can be with unusual tile combinations, the more you'll win.  Because of this...  3)  People make the craziest clues, I never played a game that I didn't laugh heartily "many times" throughout the game.  It's a true party game.

Some people mention frustration about not finding "a specific tile" they're looking for.  But, that's the point.  If a person is playing Word Blur and looking for 1 tile out of 900, they've figured out a pretty good way to lose.  While they're looking for a single word tile, they're passing over dozens of other tiles that could help describe their clue.  You'll be surprised once you start thinking a little differently.

Thanks to all the BGG'ers that have shown interest in Word Blur and given me encouragement.

RATING: 4.5
Group lateral thinking can be really fun at times, but Word Blur mostly just frustrates me.  Imagine playing charades, except you can't improvise.  Instead, you have to scan 900 little tiles for words you could use to guide your team to the correct answer.  It's just as "fun" when the roles are reversed.  Most of the other people with whom I've played it really seemed to enjoy it, and there was always plenty of energy in the room; however, it just kind of irritated me.  It was like trying to carry on a conversation when all you have is a 900-word vocabulary, with a really poor memory retrieval system.  Not for me.

Finally!  I played this with a group that made this less agonizing for me.  I actually had fun.  Yes, the frustrations were still there, but there was better mental networking between the teams' players.  I'm glad to get to enjoy this game some, but its very heavy dependence on well-paired teammates has me ever wary of playing it, unless coerced - or that same group of people again, perhaps.  :^)

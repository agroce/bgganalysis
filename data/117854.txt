I didn't do very well the first time, but I see potential here.  You can almost call it a [b]Roborally[/b] derivative, with the programmed movement and racing elements.  But it's different in that there's not much hidden information, and the rules are more elegant.  Looking forward to more plays!

A race game that does vector-based movement simply and cleanly.  Drafted event cards happily disrupt the planning n turns ahead.  Randomly drawn objective cards require you to arrive first or second on different planets; finishing the race first won't win the game if you have neglected those objectives.  Kosmonauts is a well designed game, but its solitaire-ish puzzle-like aspects limit its appeal to me.

Production quality is to a good standard, though something prettier than a bit of cardboard with the name of the game on it for the first player marker would have been nice.  The artwork is functional and quite pleasing.

Kosmonauts is one of the nice surprises of this year, a game that innovates and is neither a euro nor a war game, but rather a racing game. 
Pluses - fast, easy to learn, enough strategy to make one think, innovative, fun to play whether you win or not, well balanced
Minuses - the rules make the game look heavier and more complicated than it really is, it does not play well in 2 players

It's an space race to see how is the first to visit almost all the plenets. But they are moving, and also there's the score (depends on whe you arrive to the planet). Quite funny to play it and easy to learn it.

The vector based movement is simple, and interesting, in the way it models momentum. The event card draft makes things not totally calculable, and the mission cards incentivize different paths. in the end you have a very interesting space race.

Even better with the advanced rules. Shorter, more tense, more balanced, and just a denser experience. These should have been the standard rules.

Kosmonauts is a quick and fast playing space-exploration game.
I really like the hidden goals where it is important whether you are the first or the second to explore this planet.

Otherwise it tries to be more than it can deliver.

I think this was a real missed opportunity here.  All the planets (except the comment) going the same direction means there's no real skill or excitement about trying time your jump from one to another.  I think a great game could be made with all these different moving parts on more varied paths, though.

Players fly their space craft around the solar system, landing on planets before returning to Earth.  Fun game where players plot their movement across a hex based game board using a vector movement system.  They allocate fuel to any of the six vector hexes surrounding their rocket to thrust in those directions.  If they intercept a planet, they may land on it, claiming a victory point/planet visited token, as well as the opportunity to linger and refuel.  At the end of each turn, the planets move to then next space in their respective orbits. First to visit all bar one of the planets (Halley's Comet is included as a target) and return to Earth triggers the end of the game.  Points are summed, with bonuses for hidden objectives.  

I enjoyed this one.  The vector movement system is well implemented here, and planning is rewarded.  The highly elliptical orbit of Halley means you can hitch a ride quickly between the inner and outer solar system.  The event cards nicely prevent this game becoming a dry race game.  Well done.

RATING: 6
In Kosmonauts players race to visit the planets of our solar system faster than their competitors. It is a game of programming moves in advance, yet much more calculable and less interactive than, say, RoboRally. In fact, I found the game a little too calculable. The movement of the planets creates a bit of a timing component but except for the event cards (which are usually easily avoided if unfavourable) there are no vagaries in space (and even those are activated deliberately). The game could use a little more uncertainty.

It's probably not having that uncertainty that makes it feel a little on the long side. Having to go off to some outlandish planet in the knowledge that the voyage won't net you any points to speak of can be a little off-putting. This niggle is fixed by using the advanced rules (not included in the box), however.

All in all, a game with some nice ideas that would have benefited from a little more embellishment. That's not something you're going to hear me say very often.

Game simple to explain, with easy and clear mechanics but very fun and strategical to play.
Requires a lot of anticipation and strategical thinking since the planets are always moving so you need to think where they will be not where they are now. You also need to be flexible so you can accommodate possible changes to your "best" route that will most likely be affected by solar winds and other events.

I really like this game.  It is a cool motion puzzle with resource management.  It is an 8 in terms of ideas and play, but with the rules as written, it runs a bit long and you must plan around getting all three of your objective cards completed.

After one play, with my children, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this!  It is hard to say how it will fare with other games - there are opportunities to stitch up your opponents and some entertaining choices to be made.  It is certainly great for teaching children the planets and their relative positions, and also for introducing the concepts of speed, acceleration and Newton's First Law of Motion.

My one gripe is that you land on a planet by ending your move on it, regardless of velocity, and you move off as if your velocity was zero.  I would like to try a variant where you have to match the velocity of a planet *and* end your move on it.  Also, leaving a planet would add its velocity to yours.  The last adjustment does not add any complexity to the game, but I have a feeling that the landing criteria might make it much trickier to land and slow down the game considerably!  Still, I think a variant around this idea would be more satisfying.

I will give it a 7.5 for now and revisit this after a few more plays!

Really enjoyed this. There's a bit of RoboRally type planning in it, only much less chaotic. Actually it could use a bit more chaos, there's no real sense of danger even when you're hurtling towards the outer planet if you've calculated you can get there next turn no matter what. That aside, it's a fun game and the secret objective cards add a lot of interest and give everyone an incentive to do something different.

Pleasant, rather light design which requires some planning and tactical adjustments.  All this - preferably - being an implementation of a grand master plan developed near the beginning.

I sense the replayability might be an issue here.  Yeah, planets' starting positions are different every time but in reality you always do the same: just visit them in this order or another.

A rather fun race game. Any worries about AP are misguided, thanks to the event cards there's no point in trying to meticulously plot your next 5 turns. (OTOH, the event cards aren't in any way overpowered).

Kosmonauts is a game where each player controls a rocket which they use to visit various planets in our solar system. The planets are moving targets as each turn they advance along their orbit around the Sun. Players get points for being earlier to each planet and for accomplishing 'mission' cards handed out at the start. The game involves some resource management (fuel) but the core is a neat simultaneous planning mechanic where you place fuel onto a planning board each turn to dictate which direction and how far your ship will move as you try to maximize your trip efficiency and/or points. 

Playing with the Official Advanced Rules (the only way to play!), the accessibility combined with very mild chaos and luck, a well integrated theme, some novel mechanics, and a quick playing time all combine to make this a game that should have a very broad appeal. It offers a unique blend of mechanics and feel in a quick yet strategically satisfying game. I like this game and I think it has staying power.

This game is awesome. It is true that it doesn't work to well with 2 persons only but the mechanism of moving your spaceship is just fantastic. Authors please create extensions (ex. possibility to shoot to another rockets, another galactic map, different pace of planets move, more event cards, maybe possibility to store some events card on your hand). 

At Essen I played something like 12 boardgames. This one IMO was the best.

The intro to this game began with the chap who was doing the explaining asking which players were familiar with Newton’s first law of motion.

An object at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. An object in motion continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. 

This law is often called "the law of inertia". 

The game itself involves flying your spaceship about and trying the get the most glory by visiting the most planets (and Haley’s Comet, but not Pluto) and getting back to Earth first. The trick is that the planet keep orbiting and you have to take this into account in your calculations or you may need rescuing. Fuel is also limited and solar winds and other unexpected events (from a deck of event cards) can affect your ship.

If you’re first there you score more than second who scores more than third while four gets one paltry point. There are also secret objective cards for being first to a certain world as well as being second to two other worlds. This works in game terms but is a bit odd thematically.

Let's race to the planets! In rockets. We have some secret missions and control our rockets by spending fuel to fire us off in particular directions. And you keep going until you land or switch your fuel.

And the planets continue to move in orbit of course. And there are random events, of course, including solar winds that can help you or blow you off course. Don't head into the sun!

Very clean, very elegant design. You learn the rules in 10 minutes. More fun than it sounds like!

Space travel by an ingenious hexagonal inertia engine. Planet movement creates wicked timing puzzles.

Has elegant solutions for avoiding the obvious problems:
- Personal secret goals for making sure that players won't always choose the same move as everyone else.
- Player-controlled events for avoiding excessive calculation.
- The comet is a very effective, and definitely necessary, fast lane for moving between inner and outer planets.

Extremely simple rules: There's absolutely no need to ever refer to the rulebook after you've played this once.

各自で経路に異なりの生じやすいレースゲーム
短所も長所も多いという印象。短所は、主にプレイアビリティ。独自性はかなり高いと思うので、テーマや雰囲気が気に入ればそれなりに高評価出来る人も多そう。自分はそうだった

星に乗ったまま星任せ移動可能なのが、ハレー彗星の軌道を活かせといわんばかりで上手く働いている。
適当に突っ込むと宇宙の真ん中で燃料切れになる恐怖が味わえる
イベントは手番プレイヤーだけでなく、みんなにも発動するというのがギスギス感を緩めている

プレイ時間長め。エンド条件に、ターン制限的なものの追加やもうすこし必要星数減らすとかしてもよかったかも
時間短縮のため仕方ないんだろうけど、燃料配分の実施をみんな同時にっていうのは雑なルールだと思う
どう燃料配分すればどうなるかといった判断が、燃料の維持と惑星の軌道周回もあって非常に厄介。考えれば簡単に一本道の結論が出る時点で無意味なパズル要素という気がするけど、この面倒さと独自性がそのまま直結しているので難しいところ
なんで2着特命ボーナスがあり、しかもそのほうが一着の特命ボーナスより高いのかっていうのが如何にもバランスのためっぽく興醒め
スタート地点同じなので、序盤は地球の近くへみんなで殺到しやすく、またその際に手番順が大きく影響し易いのは問題な気がする
毎ラウンドの惑星周回移動が煩雑
救援呼ぶことのペナルティが弱く、場合によってはむしろ活用したくなってしまうこともある。マイナス勝利点でのペナルティもあった方が良いと思う
ルールブックに於けるイベントカードの説明が少なめ

Tried it out at Essen. The basic movement system with momentum on a hex grid, and orbiting planets to visit, works fine (though there are some odd simplifications for playability's sake, e.g. that you automatically halt at a planet regardless of how fast you were going). The secret goals and event cards introduce a bit more randomness that I'd prefer, and by necessity (given the solar system setting) the large map takes up a lot of table space, so we decided not to buy it, but it was fun and I'd be happy to play it again sometime. Meanwhile it makes me want to go old school and play [gameid=18481] again. :)

A great lighter racing game. Although there's very little apparent randomness, luck is still important in the presence of bonuses for being first/second on a planet - if two players happen to fly together, there may be a very small window in which you can land as the second player. Still, it's a quick game (45 minutes) and it's fun, so it doesn't  matter that much.

As a race game on hex tiles, it's quite nice. Only problem I saw was analysis paralysis with calculating possible routes among the moving planets.

Since we were trying to play fast, I at some point started making rash decisions so as not to let the others wait too long, which almost threw my space ship off the board twice. It's not a game to be played fast, and it probably is rather boring when played too slowly. Surprisingly I find it better than Power Boats, though.

After one play. An interesting family game, not typical euro, not ameritresh, not a hybrid. There is a spirit Roborally and Survive, but it has its own unique mechanics.

The game has very simple rules, there is little of all these nuances, which the authors are added to an artificial balance. And at the same time, while playing with the geeks, any error can fatally affect the victory points.

After second: not recommended for two players. Four - good choice.

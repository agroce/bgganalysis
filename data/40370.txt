This played quicker than I thought.  Several interesting decisions that are going to add much to future play.  The interaction was great, with the "popularity magnet" mechanic in its best form yet.

Estupendo filler de lo más visttoso con las islas repletas de casas. 

Muy fácil de jugar y que entra por los ojos, suele gustar bastante alto los nuevos en el mu nudillo.

RATING: 6.5
In a typical Colovini fashion, the game can feel a tad chaotic, but in truth this game really is one that can be planned out.  Its randomness is strictly tied to card shuffles and distribution, leaving the players fair opportunity to work with that knowledge.  The variations in the players boards ensures that no player can see the same cards with equal interest - and that forced uneven interest helps drive the game along.  I am surprised that the game hasn't seen more widespread play.  Perhaps the price point is an issue?

Original game using a strange mechanics.  It is not obvious how to use cards, and there are maybe too many icons.  It is an abstract, but nicely disguised.

- snel, eenvoudig spel met toch een aantal tricky kantjes
- oranje = krachtigste extra kaart (je wint bij gelijk spel) --> zo vallen de meeste kaarten van het schip in jouw handen
- piraat nooit in het schip steken, want dan krijg je die toch terug tenzij je de piratenbescherming hebt
- zijn alle eilandjes wel in evenwicht????

At first glance this game seems to be another bland game where you build stuff to get other stuff which will let you get even other stuff which will win you the game. But in fact it's a very clever game with a theme that works rather well. You're playing cards too add colonists to your island. Some you can play directly some you put in a stack where you have to make sure they like your island best. Some clever balancing mechanics at work which will ensure a close game. You really have to play this one to see the subtle ways available to manipulate fate. Little gem by Colovini.

Very luck-based game.  The cards in the game are balanced but the Islands themself not, therefor there will always be a player a few steps behind.
But I still enjoyed the game.

RATING: 7.5
Very quick game.  Nice, tough decisions.  I played with two so that might be why but you try to seed the ship with things that will go your way, hopefully.  I think this would be excellent with three (like a lot of his games).  Sometimes the cards won't be to your advantage but it's a very quick game.  Very quick.  Looks great, too.

Played with 4 players, it was too much chaotic. Half of the time, it was hard to throw a good card to the ship for the arriving phase. Maybe we played too fast being the first time, I hadn't enough time to plan really good my turns.

I hope it gets better with 2 or 3 players and played a little bit slower.

At least it has very good wood bits, but the cards are really thin.

Better with 4 or 5 than with 3. Enjoyable game. I do feel you can end up at the mercy of the cards, and there could be a runaway leader problem (though I've also seen an initial leader falter). A solid design embodying everything I like about Colovini, but has some of his weaknesses too.

After 2 more plays, still digging this. Hope to play this weekend.

Played once. Really, really enjoyed it. Component lend themselves perfectly to the design, and support what you're doing each turn. Room for clever play, but you need to be lucky sometimes too. Love it.


Colovini? Big, colorful pieces? SOLD!!!

After digesting the rules (and adding clarity from the various questions here on the forums) I can see this is one of those games where you're constantly scanning the other players' stuff to ensure you're not helping them too much with your card play. But whereas in many games that feels a lot like 'work' (e.g. Puerto Rico), this game is simple enough that it's quick work and easy.

There is more depth to this than meets the eye, I think. Typical Colovini, and one I really look forward to playing.

Colovini has done some interesting games, but also some pretty weak ones, I found this to be at his soulless worst.  Very analytical and yet also very random, without even the pretext of theme, this is almost completely vacuous and without interest except as a combinatorics exercise. I think there is an interesting game built on top of what are clever ideas, but Islas Canarias is definitely not it.

RATING: 5
An interesting mechanism where settlers go to the island that best matches their desired traits.  However, why you can have a little influence on your island's suitability, it's kind of a crap shoot where the settlers go.  The special power cards can also help a lot, although you have little control over which ones you can get based on which cards you draw.  Overall, an interesting idea that I'm not sure came together very well.

Excellent game this one. Can get a bit of luck with the cards you draw but there is plenty of strategy in what card to play when and you do get to play the pirates to hopefully peg back the leaders. 1 Play.

A clever logic mechanic but I simply didn't enjoy this game. Planning is almost impossible and there is a runaway leader problem. The idea that a leader will clog up his or her board and therefore allow others to catch up doesn't work as it is ridiculously easy to upgrade buildings and then they become pirate-proof anyway.

The graphics are all a bit muddy and murky, but the game works as a nice placement game. It was much faster than I expected, and I went for the wrong bonuses but it was a nice game, although counter-intuitive. try before you buy, it may be something or it may be nothing.

It's funny to find a game from L. Colovini (that usually rewards thinking and intelligent decision making) in the range of a publisher that usually only publishes very light family games that are not appealing to a gamer.
"Islas Canarias" is different. Well still, from a point of view gamer the game is light, but one you can enjoy. The mechanisms offer you choice to follow a strategy and thanks to the pirates there is also some interaction. Mathemacially it seems good balanced. So I encourage every geek to take a look at this. However a remark to Ameritrash lovers: this game is a typical Eurogame which you will find probably too dry.

Fine and pretty much unique game with only a few rules. It plays well and is fun, but it's a bit too light for my taste. The amount of luck in this game is a factor that I'm not very fond of, too.

On their turn players usually play one card to their board to build something unless they run out of useful cards, then they have to play another card to a central stack. This stack gets resolved after each player had a turn. Whoever fulfills the prerequisite of a card best gets to build the associated building. The prerequisite always is having the most available spaces next to something. The more buildings a player has the more difficult it will be for him to win a card. Whenever a player has two or three small buildings he can transform them into a medium or large building. A few special powers rewarded to the player who is strongest in the related color and pirates add more to think about. 

The central mechanism of attributing the card stack is charming and exciting for a few rounds. Some special powers are much stronger than others though and getting the right cards for them can be decisive. Islas Canarias suffers from too much effort with not enough control to engage in the long term. Innocuous for occasional enjoyment.

* While I love a number of Colovini's designs, I'm not entirely sure what to make of this one yet.  As several others here on BGG have stated, the game is intriguing but seems to offer players almost no control.  One thing that certainly can't be argued is the quality of the components.  There's a nice selection of wooden buildings, VERY thick tiles, and good cards.

Update: hmm, not much control, but it works. Not great, downgraded.

Typical Colovini. It's a balanced working system with a tiny bit of theme pasted on. Not sure yet how much control there really is. And one board seems to have advantages. Need to play more.

The "cascading preferences" mechanism is very cute. Often a card that is "good" to play on your own island is bad to throw in the ship, and vice versa, which makes you think twice. Fun with 5, but probably better with 3 or so. Works with 2.

Quite a bit of luck with the cards you draw, so the strategy is really which privileges to go for, and where to place and especially when/how to upgrade. Could play as a "family game" without the privileges.

Because there is so little interaction (pirates are few, are hard to control, and have a relatively small effect), there is a potential runaway leader problem. However, it is mitigated because the leader's board will have fewer spaces open, so will win fewer ship settlers.

De truc is om juist die mensen op het schip te krijgen die op jouw eiland willen wonen.
Met name het blauwe en oranje privilege zijn wel wat aan de sterke kant.

Fully functional system.  It all sounds like it would be fun.  It conceptually plays off the old logic puzzles (Jane has a red hat and likes to sit next to boys, Timmy has a red hat but doesn't want to sit next to other people with the same color hat, etc).  

While the conditional alignment brings some joy, the system is just too difficult for me to enjoy it fully.  Most of the time you just sit and watch the chain reactions.  Theoretically, the player in the lead should be clogging up his mat and losing out on the shipment round, but it is so easy to consolidate your pieces (and keep them safe) that the leader tends to run away with the game with no significant decision to make on their end.  

The pirates are the worst, not because they screw other players badly, but rather they tie up your hand and are effectively useless to you.  Especially once the leader has built his palaces.  If you keep drawing pirates you will lose.

I like the concept of predicting the build from the shipping, by seeding the board, and I do like the way the board forms, but in the end I can't help but feel that all my best moves came from random results.

This game has all the joy of a snow globe.  If you shake it a certain way you can kind of manipulate the flakes how you'd like and it is nice to watch them all fall into place, but don't expect there to be much more here than that.

I have to point out that the card are is horrific.  No really, it is painful to the eye.  I'm not a big fan of Matthias Catrein in general, but dear lord, this is some of the worst art I've ever seen in a game.  I'd probably give this game a 5, but the art is so offensive to my sensibilities that I've knocked it down to a 4.

Too much luck involved was my first impression. I must try it again soon with more players (I've only played it with 2) and see what does this game worths.

Another 2 player game. Decisions are not that difficult but they tend to be more reasonable with some experience - as in all other games. I don't dislike this game tottaly. I'm not a big Colovini fan and he's giving me strong solid reasons for it.

Pretty enjoyable little game of playing cards to develop buildings on your island. Interesting placement mechanic of cards specifying things like 'blue building next to this, then that, then something else'. Once each turn, you play a card to build on your own island, plus play a card used as competition between all players (hopefully your card will give you another building). On the lookout for a cheap copy.

There's something here I want to like, but I don't.  My only towns were destroyed on the first turns, and there was nothing I could do to recover.  To add insult to injury, my cards all helped other players and there was no way for me to manipulate them to help myself.

Someone else said "the game plays itself" and I agree.

This is a really novel game, players seek to build up their islands and seed ships with settlers who want islands that look like theirs in order to get even more houses. 

There's a fair dash of randomness, a bit of AP, but definitely an interesting game as folks try to develop their houses(points) as efficiently as possible.

Although I'm typically not a fan of Colovini's overly tactical games, here he has really perfected his craft and made an elegant and engaging game I enjoy despite its nature. It also helps that it has a puzzle-like spatial element, which is something I enjoy in games, and the components are great. This has been a success with everyone I've introduced it to- highly recommended.

this is the classical 7.
Simple enough rules, some interesting mechanics.
You don't have much control on what is about to happen because u can't keep in consideration all the possible precedences, all the organizations of all the islands, all the scores. And the cards are just too random and too fundamental to give you a sensation of full control on the game.
There's a good interaction with other players.
Components are of an acceptable quality.
The theme, well, seems rather pasted on but this is not that bad with me.
Plays fast, enough fun. That is, a 7

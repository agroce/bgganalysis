We like playing this from time to time with the right company. It's easy to learn and is similar to Phase 10 and Rummikub. So, it can be fun, but only if you don't play it more than once or twice a year, maybe during holidays. :)

Each round has an increasing number of cards during which you try to lay down sets or runs.

Gift from Patti M.

Recommended with 3-7 players (best 4). 30 mins.

RATING: 6
Works well with kids and large groups, but involves far too much shuffling, given the size of the deck and the fact that rounds may only last one turn. Something like Love Letter would be a better bet for a smaller group.

If you have five or more people who want to play Rummy desperately this is your game. Oh, and you have to love wild cards because one out of eight cards is a wild card.

A good filler game - gets better with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good card game that you can get traditional card game players to play.  You start with 3 cards and each hand add one more up to 13 for the last hand.  

We play a variant dubbed "Killer Crowns".  That means that you can't count any points unless you can go out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A luck-fest. 
If you MUST play this, play it with no more than five players. More than that, and you can write an opera between turns.
If you want to play something very similar, but more enjoyable, give Quiddler a try. Not that Quiddler is a glorious game: but it's one major improvement on Five Crowns.

Five Crowns relies far more on luck than strategy (boo!), but it's actually quite a bit of fun - especially later in the game when one has a larger handful of cards!  You'll take a new card, then all of a sudden your whole hand can change.  And the luck actually adds to the suspense... when one of the other players wins the round, you still get that one last chance to *hopefully* pick up a card that will let you escape without losing any points!

[ESP] Le puse nota 6 a este juego en un principio y así permaneció sin ser actualizada. Pero esa nota no es justa ya que debe ser lejos el juego que más llega a la mesa en mi grupo. Si bien es una simple modificación del "Carioca" por alguna razón es el comodín favorito y lo pasamos muy bien jugándolo. Al ser relajado conversamos y nos reímos todo el tiempo.

For whatever reason, our party group has been playing this almost every time we have gotten together this past year.  Fun is had by all, although the depth of strategy is pretty surface.  Random luck has as much to do with it as with any strategy, but one can tend to a BBQ while playing and not miss out on anything too significant.  [Sale price $7.99]

My father in law will play it.  Way too much luck.  Next to zero skill involved in this.  I love card games but want something that I feel is taking more than a glorified version of Go Fish, with a little Rummy thrown in to make it at least slightly interesting.  But family members love it, so I will play it.

After not pllaying this game for 2 years and coming back to it I had to upgrade slightly.  It's fun for what it is.  Upgraded to a 6 (11/27/09)

I thought Five Crowns would be a replacement game for games such as President, Lectio, Rummy etc., but having played it a couple of times I think it’s a worse game than those. First of all, it’s actually quite a long game as you’re playing 11 rounds. Second, the luck of the draw and the fact that cards that you need can be discarded without you being able to pick them up. Third, the gameplay simply isn’t that interesting.

The scoring is pretty neat as the round ends after one player plays all of his/her cards, and then the rest have to play as many as they can in order to avoid penalty points (fewest points after 11 rounds is the winner).

The luck of the draw is obviously present, but what irritates me the most is when somebody who isn’t your immediate right neighbor discards a card you need - then you have no way of getting that card and you’re just screwed. I know, you can work around those situations, and it helps that there are two of every cards in the deck, but still… It feels like unnecessary randomness, and you need to be lucky that your neighbor discards a card you can actually use, otherwise it’s just random draws… Jokers and the round-joker are extremely important. I think the first few rounds are rather boring, but from round 4 on, when you can play two different sets, the game starts to shine. Still, there are many other semi-traditional card games I would rather play, so while  Five Crowns isn’t a bad game, it’s just not that interesting to me.

Don't take this one too seriously! A great game if you want to have some fun and not strain your brain (at all.) Good one for large groups or have had fun as a 2-player game as well.  Play this one when its late and you forget that the card you just got rid of is the "wild" card for this round....too late now, no going back now you idiot!

Components: Standard quality cards (i.e. not very good), but with vivid colors and pleasing illustrations on the face cards.

Experience: I played a public-domain version (Rap) quite a bit some years ago, and enjoyed it. The addition here of an extra suit adds little to the game, and actually makes the most difficult number (5) easier to achieve. But the game is still fun, and lasts about the right amount of time.

Solidly within the Rummy family, but with just enough variation to make it distinct. My favorite Rummy game after Mhing.

You say you want a quick trick taking game that's easy to teach and always available? With five suits and colorful cards, this might be your ticket. We've taken this so many times on vacation and pull it out to play. Besides having to remind people what's wild, the game is easy. It has a bit of randomness in it as people can get dealt a hand that they can lay down and go out, but so what. Play the game and maybe you'll get a great hand.

Apparently, the point of the game is that it's a nice relaxing thing to do while talking to your friends. Nobody I've ever played this with has been very talkative. Maybe that's why I don't like it.

This rummy variant does not differ enough from traditional rummy to warrant much attention. Having a fifth suit makes finding sets easier, as does the abundance of 'wilds', but there aren't enough interesting decisions to draw me back in. The game also overstays its welcome, because when you start with 3s it takes eleven painstaking rounds for "the Kings to go Wild."

Plays very similarly to Quiddler, but has suits and numbers instead of words. I'd rather play Progressive Rummy, a game my friend Steve taught me how to play.
Edit March 2016: Downgraded from a 6 rating to a 3 rating. Each round goes to the person who gets the most wilds, which when playing with my parents, was my mom. Each round. At least with Quiddler there is some skill, in arranging the letters to form words, and having a larger vocabulary is an advantage.

I have played this game a lot with a normal deck of cards...but recently got a hold of this version.  Its a great game to pull out with a group of friends or family at gatherings when perhaps some certain type of beverages are being consumed :) It takes a while, but it allows for time for chatting and not having to be mega focused on what you are doing.  Is this the most exciting game in the world?? no...but does it work in a large group of non gamers? yes.  I would pick this up for 5$ or less...you can easily play this exact game with a normal deck of cards...so dont feel pressured to get this.

RATING: 8
My high rating is due to the fact that this one of very few games that I can play often and still enjoy. Fun, with a sense of accomplishment, without burning your brain (one of the easiest games I've ever played). Very luck-based; however, I like that. Kids as young as 7 can play if they are willing/able to hold 14 cards in their hand (we use wooden card racks). In my experience, it is often not feasible to catch up with & surpass the leader, however, it can be done and makes the game exciting until the end. Plays well with 2, 3, 4 (haven't tried with more). BTW, even though there are a lot of cards, you can play in a very small space, such as in a car or on a plane because you don't lay any sets down until you go out.

Sort of like Up and Down the river, but also a lot like Rummikub and Gin Rummy. Very popular with everyone I know including (and espeically) the non gamers. Quick to learn and simple to play.  Lacking a bit in player interraction and holding 13 cards is terrible, but this is only for 1 round.  Recommended like bread dipped in Olive Oil.  yummm..

RATING: 5
Very luck dependent game, but way better than Phase 10. There some decisions to be made to help that can help you win. Like do I start discarding my high cards to reduce my score. Or hold onto them and hope the player before me discards high value cards and make therefore make a set or run.

A personal favorite of my family for over a decade. Great for any occation when you want to play a card game that doesn't involve much thinking, yet still has some strategy to it. Terrific for young and old alike, just about everyone I've played this with has enjoyed the experiance. Plays great for 1-8 players, a flexibility that few games match.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A slightly less challenging variant of traditional Rummy, Five Crowns is fun nevertheless. It's easier to complete books and runs of cards due to the deck having duplicates and lots of wild cards. As such, the chances for scoring large amounts of points are higher (much to your detriment). Strategy and an understanding of statistics are still important, despite the increased randomness.

Not my thing. I'm not huge on rummy to begin with, and I find Five Crowns too swingy, especially near the end of the game. In a way, I treat it similarly to how I treat Wizard, but with less enjoyment of the underlying mechanisms to prop the rating up. My family enjoys it, so I'm generally okay to play this once or twice in a visit. It's also easy enough to play when drunk, which is a useful advantage.

RATING: 5.5
Gin-Rummy on steroids.  Five suits, variable size hands, wild cards & jokers.  The "official" game is made up of 11 rounds.  Eleven rounds sounds long; however, with all the wild cards, the rounds can go very quickly.

The wild cards seem to drive the game - get dealt a bunch and you'll go out early and burn someone else.  Not too much complex decision making going on.

Likely a really good game to play with non-gaming adult friends.  They'll be intrigued by the five-suited deck, but comfortable with the rummy engine underneath the game.

Great rummy variant.  Can be very challenging with 6 players as someone invariably always goes out on their first turn.  As a variant to keep people interested in such games, try to get the most points while those losers who go out early chase the lowest....it is quite hard to maximize the number of points you take in your hand at 10+ cards...

I don't generally like rummies, but I like this one.  Don't know what that means...  I do like the gradually-increasing size of the hand, though, and having a different wild card every round.  Update: Having played it again recently, I've downgraded it a notch for being too luck-heavy; I still enjoy it, although it's often a case of spotting the obviously-correct course of action and just hoping the right cards come up.

Don't play this with too many people or be prepared for getting totally bored.  However, with 4-5 players it is pretty fun.  I like it because it lends itself to multitasking . . . you don't have to pay attention to much except for the player right before you, so you can do whatever (I knit) and play at the same time.  Also a hit at our house because our last name is King, so the tag line gets a lot of jokes around here.

I played this game yestarday at my game night with friedns and family, and we played with the max number of players, and we all had a blast with it!  I don't really care for the discarding rules of most rummy games (Taking part of the pile, but have to use the bottom card), but I do like rummy-like games, and this one is no exception!  Get it!

It has kind of become a staple game whenever I have game night or bring games.  Everyone seems to enjoy and they learn it quickly!

Very fun card game, that plays like Phase 10 but faster. The artwork on the cards is very nice, with color-coding in addition to the five suits. Each suit has a theme to its characters, and the rules are simple without the frustrating reset Phase 10 frequently results in. A great game to pick up and play for just a few rounds, or go full-on scoring head-to-head with competitive family members, and easy enough for kids to figure out while maintaining good gameplay with adults.

I am quite fond of rummy and played it quite a bit in my younger days. This is exactly that, with wild cards included. Each round you get an increasing number of cards and with each round the identity of the wild changes. With the wilds, it is quite possible to go out immediately (this happened multiple times in our game) so rounds can be short. But, as the game says on the box, it is not over until the Kings go wild and to be honest that takes way way longer than a relatively light card game has any right to take. I'm not wild about trying it again, though the variant that another player suggested (where the cards get less in each subsequent round) might make it seem like it takes less time. Or not.

This game would be an okay mindless pass time if it took 15-30 minutes, but the game I played (with six players) took over an hour.  Everyone was looking pretty bored by the time it ended.

The biggest problem of the game is the length. The early rounds can be fun, but once you have 13 cards in your hand, it can be frustrating to manage all of them at once for the full lay-down. Also, another flaw in those latter rounds is the idea that those rounds almost act as a comeback mechanic. You can be winning the entire game, but get a 50-point round and end up in last. Really a luck-of-the-draw game.

I'd wanted to try this for a while, and was pretty disappointed in the end. The double deck means that wild cards are simply too frequent. The result is that most hands, even the more complicated later hands of 10+ cards, end within 3 draws. Bad hands take substantial time to improve, and there really isn't much decision making in doing so. The whole thing just feels random, and a bit painful, in the end.

A good time, generally.  Maybe a little too complicated for really young kids, and a little dry for teenagers, but the adults in our group really enjoyed it.  I thought it was alright.  I like a little theme dashed into my games, though, and this is pretty much just a Rummy variant.  

Update 10/14:  I dropped it .5 because I feel like it runs a little long with my group, and the scoring requires a notepad or something similar to keep track, which makes me feel like I'm playing Bridge.

A pretty fun variation on Rummy, I like this one better than Phase 10, which is competing for my group's time.  It is a little random and chaotic at times, but the way the round ends really helps mitigate luck of the draw at least somewhat.  Sometimes I think there are too many wilds, and sometimes I think not enough, but overall I really enjoy this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Just a over-simplified Rummy variant. Each round finished after 2 or 3 turns around the table; there are just too many wild cards. I got almost 25% of my total (bad) score on the 1st hand just because of the card deal and the instant first-turn finish. Runs a bit long for what it is. Meh.

RATING: N/A
A pretty good Rummy variant. The risk/reward makes the two-player game quite tight.

In my favorite session of the game, I played incredibly defensively the entire game against my opponent. For the first 9 rounds, I was unable to beat him, but I took 4 points in the first round and no more than 3 in any following round (usually taking 0). I had only 13 points going into the final hand, in which I aggressively went out before my opponent. He revealed his hand, which features multiple unmatched face cards. He had one draw to match a set...and he got exactly what he needed. He matched his face cards and took no points in the final round. That was pretty good.

Pros:
* Quick to setup, quick to play, quick to put away.
* Anyone's game right to the end.
* Plays well with 2.
* Inexpensive and small.
* Can be played with 2 sets of "Solitaire for Two" tiles.

Cons:
* Very little strategy.
* Not much direct interaction (less than normal Rummy)
* Deck needs to be shuffled multiple times.
* Not much you can do in the early rounds (with 3, 4 and 5 cards) except churn through the deck waiting to get lucky.

Neutral:
* Late rounds are often over in only one or two turns as there's almost always something you can do with all 10+ cards fairly easily.

I received this game with a box I won in an auction. My wife decided she liked it before we'd even finished our first three rounds. We've played it about four times now and I'd describe it as a combination of Rummikub (pattern matching) and regular Gin Rummy (option to pick up discarded card; must "go out" all at once). The use of wild cards and jokers makes the game very quick and spices up the pattern matching a bit. This is a good, quick, casual, "tell me about your day while we play a game of cards" game and I expect will be enjoying it for quite some time.

Starting at a 6.5. Probably won't move from there.

= 2013-07-22 - R:7

Had to take this one to a 7. We've been playing it quite a bit. Yesterday I put the cards in Mayday USA standard sleeves. They're a near-perfect fit (tiny bit pokes out the top) and it makes shuffling so much easier. I've considered combining two "Solitaire for Two" sets to make "Five Crowns in a Bag", which would get rid of shuffling altogether and let us play outside more easily.

It's a Rummy game, in other words, a standard deck of cards except with one extra suit and no deuces so you can't use it to play other card games. I'd say play Rummy with a standard deck if that's what you want to play, and change the wildcard each round if that's what you want to do.  No reason to use a special deck, though the artwork is ok.

DO NOT buy this game. It seems like a good idea. The idea was pretty cool.

They failed at making it good. E is for execution. Tragically bad game.

Terrible game, boring, extremely difficult to shuffle. 

We played here and there for a few months and then basically hid the game so we'd never have to play it again. Everyone complained through each game. Otherwise good gamers, all complaining. Because the game is broken.

The mechanics are not at all mathematically solid. The game favors certain seating positions. And it sucks too, so there are a lot of reasons not to play it.

We have been playing a version of this with two decks of cards for years before I got this set.  I actually find this version to be significantly easier/faster than when playing with playing cards.  This makes it much more likely that you can get slammed with bad cards.  We still pull this out because it's right there, but we really do prefer playing with playing cards.

1 play, 2er, with the mini version

It's mostly just a rummy style game with a few twists. I like it better than Rummy, but I'd much rather play a Mystery Rummy game. 11 rounds, though, seems like it would be way too long ... maybe the mini cannister version got it right?

Like Rummy, you draw a card (discard pile or draw deck), then discard. - Twist 1: the first hand is 3 cards, then each hand gets bigger until you get to 14 (7 in the mini version). 
- Twist 2: cards with same number as this hand size, plus the jokers, are wild
- Twist 3: cards have different point values
- Twist 4: don't meld until you go out (and end the hand)
If you can go out, meld out all your cards: sets of 3+ cards (all the same number) or runs of 3+ cards (all the same suit). Every other player gets one final turn, then melds whatever they can. Everyone gets Penalty Points for the cards remaining in hand. At the end of the game, the player with the fewest PP wins.

Not a fan at all.  I like Rummy and thought that this would be a good variant but it is basically a really dumbed down version of rummy with far more luck and less strategy.  Here are the things I don't like about this game:

1) Big, thick deck of 122 cards.  Shuffling between each hand is tedious and time-consuming because you can't shuffle that many cards without splitting it into smaller decks and mixing.

2) Way too many wild cards!  The deck has 6 jokers plus each hand will have 8 additional wilds.  That is 14 wilds each hand (11.5% of the cards are wild).  Way too many.  This commonly allows people to have Rummy after just one or two turns, then you are back to shuffling the massive deck again.

3) The inclusion of a 5th suit (stars) seemed intriguing at first but in the end it really didn't add anything strategically to the game.  I think it was just added so that they could convince people that this game couldn't be played with a normal deck and must be bought.

4) The motto on the box "The game isn't over 'til the kings go wild!" is a meaningless expression.  It's basically another way of saying "The game isn't over until the last hand!", which is always the 11th hand.  They try to make the end game sound suspenseful and unpredictable with that motto, but it's not at all.

All in all, if you like Rummy then just stick to rummy with a regular deck.  This game is actually more like Gin Rummy because it only lets you take the top card of the discard, unlike Rummy Royal and other variants that I prefer that let you take all the cards you want from the discard deck.

This game is mindless and stupid and the constant shuffling of the massive deck is needlessly tedious.  It's just another example of a company trying to add a few small twists to a classic card game in an attempt to make money off it.  There is no originality here, it is just a con job.  They are hoping that people who don't know how to play rummy will spend 10 bucks on a bad version of it instead of realizing that they can play a much better version of it with a regular deck and rules that can easily and freely be found online.  The game 'Rage' did a very similar butchery of 'Oh Hell'.  Avoid that one as well.

RATING: 6
A neat idea and I usually like this sort of thing, but it seems to really just come down to the luck of the draw. And with more players the top card of the face-up discard pile is almost irrelevant. Usually in these types of games you would have to really consider what to discard because you might be directly helping an opponent by giving them the right card, but with more players it's just a matter of chance as to whether or not you get or give the right card.

Update: I've come to appreciate this a little more as a light casual game. Maybe at the end of a night of gaming and you just don't want to think too much. You also really need to keep it to 3-4 players.

While Five Crowns is not a game befitting a king, as mass market games go, this is an acceptable light diversion on occasion.

This will not present you with a cavalcade of choices,  but the time investment is negligible as the game tends to rush towards it's conclusion.  If you expect very little from it,  you may find it mildly fun rather than downright  disappointing.

I feel a bit guilty giving this a six. It's long, random, and there are no interesting choices. But it's a guilty pleasure. Really it's more about giving your fingers something to do that keeps your brain free to think about conversation with friends. You could just as easily be knitting with your friends. But then you'd have to carry a bunch of yarn around. and you'd have to learn a useful skill. Who wants that?

I like playing with 4 players. It may take a little longer to play with 4 players, but it's fun to see how many players can "go out" after the initial player gets all of his cards out of his hand. This is the rule that I like about this game. You still may get penalized with cards left in your hand, but at least you have the chance to get rid of some "runs" or a "suit", which will leave you with less points than if you never discarded.

A friend kept telling me how fun this game was but I had never played. Last December I was visiting some other friends in North Carolina and found these at one of those temporary toy stores that set up in malls just for Christmas time. They had everything half price so i was excited to find this game. My friend and I played several games, and her husband played with us too.  It is fun if a little bit long to play.  Might vary it a little playing with my kids and play fewer rounds.  I liked it!

Pretty easy game to teach and play; a good game for families who like collecting runs and books.  There's not a whole lot of interaction between players though except for that general annoyance you'll express when another player goes out really quickly leaving you to eat a lot of points or the player after you is just picking up everything you discard (you will certainly have time for non-game related conversation).  I think 11 rounds is a bit long for one game; the suggestion to play the odd numbered card rounds is a good one (3,5,7,9,J,K) for a shortened game, but if you play 2 you might as well play the whole 11.  The lowest score I've seen for a 6 round game has been in the sixties.  I would play it again.

I love the Set Ent. games but this one just has always been flat for me.  I'll play it if no one wants to play anything else, but it would be a last option game for me.  There is just not much to set it apart from anything else to me.

They should call this game "Whoever gets dealt the most wild cards wins".

Purchased before finding BGG.  Too long and repetitive for what it is. I'd prefer to play Phase 10 where your goals are at least different each round.

Probably my favorite of all the Rummy variants I've ever seen or heard of.  But that's not really saying a lot, seeing as how I'd almost always rather play something better (using my definition of better, of course).

I'm actually tempted to pick up a copy, however, just so I've got something "traditional" that I can talk non-gamers into playing before they suggest something that really sucks.

It's, basically, a commercial version of Rummy with a couple extra twists.  If you like Rummy, you'll like this.  If you don't like Rummy, this isn't going to change your mind.

How this game doens't have a higher rating I've no idea. Perfect for the whole family it adds a twist or two to the usual Rummy formula that hooks everyone within two rounds of playing. Top draw for a serious gaming evening, social gathering or even out camping. For anyone who has any interest in card games this is a must have. Buy it now.

Five Crowns is a fairly fun and fast-moving twist on traditional card games. In particular, my wife and I enjoy it as the kind of game to play at the park, while the kids are running around the jungle gym.

It's not terribly deep or strategic and luck-of-the-draw certainly plays a very big factor in the game but it's also very accessible to non-gamers, is fun to play in family settings and is overall a worthwhile experience...most of the time. Unfortunately, there are some times where the game seems to drag on as nobody draws the cards they need. Due in part to this, I tend to think the game is better with a fewer number of players (say 3 or 4).

Very easy, especially since it's based on another card game and follows similar rules to other existing games. But lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng. 13 rounds is slightly excessive. -_-

these decks are best used for five-suited variants of other games than for the official "five crowns" game

I like the rummy part.  And the nicely designed deck part.  Don't like the interminable part.

This can be played with two decks of standard playing cards.  I call it Wild Gin Rummy.

RATING: 5.5
This is basically rummy, no better and no worse than traditional rummy. Almost exactly the same as the "65" form of rummy. Rummy is a pretty fun game, but why buy it? Why not just play rummy with regular cards?

Luck fest, where every round a different card is the joker. Just to confuse the players? Did not enjoy this.

An ok rummy variant, yet rather too long for my liking.

This is a neat rummy variant.  It's unique in that it has 5 suites instead of 4.  The growing hands mechanic is clever, but pretty much the same as in quiddler.  I enjoy it, but I think I prefer rummy.  The game is very similar to Shanghai.

It's ok and solid in its own right, but there are so many vastly superior card games out there.

My family LOVES to play this. I wish I could interest them in so many other fantastic games, but they're "too complex" for their tastes; that pretty much means anything but simple card games.

RATING: 7.5
An improvement over another card rummy variant we own: Phase 10.  Quite enjoyable if you aren't in the mood for a heavier game.  The two major downfalls: I'm not sure how to counteract the luck and the hand size (13 cards at the end) gets a bit too large.

This is a fancy card game, using regular playing cards (but like, 5 decks of them, I think). My dad and his wife play this game a lot, and they are in their 60's, and otherwise only play like Yahtzee and Euchre, if that tells you anything. They got it for me for Christmas.

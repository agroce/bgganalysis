GAME: Masters of Venice
RANK: 2596
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very confusing after one game. The rules are not intuitive at all but surmountable. Understanding what drives the markets is another thing though and it will probably take several plays before the penny finally drops and a reasonable strategy is apparant. This is a good thing but it does mean that I am unsure yet whether the game is really good, average or flawed.

RATING: 6
Masters of Venice offers very interesting market speculation, and I actually find the market better than in most economic games. MoV is a quite heavy economic game and I find the mfg suggested ages of 15 years and up spot on. I cannot imagine kids or non-gamer wives enjoying it.

In the core of Masters of Venice is a well oiled engine. The playability of the game just is not that good. The graphic design effectively hinders distinguishing actions spaces or coins from each other. The English rulebook is erroneous and does not cover all necessary rules. Administration of the market prices involves a lot of small rules that are easy to forget, and you do adjust the market constantly.

I would say, that the developers did not blind test the game at all. It seems that all testers have been familiar with the game and hence have not asked the questions new players would have. This is really a shame since the designers appear to be quite potent at what they do. This is apparent from the fact that there are no fatal flaws in the game. It just the presentation that might keep people from playing MoV.

In short, the game could be fantastic but would have benefited from rewriting some of the rules, better graphic design and player aids. There is nothing broken, but the game play is just a bit cluttered. My advice to you is:
*Print the errata,
*Definitely print the player aids, and
*Most importantly, demo the game yourself at least once before taking it to a game night, so that you know in which direction all the pieces move

Love the game, unfortunately it's tough to get to the table.  Maybe because it's an economic game that requires thought.  Can't expect that of people, can we?  I hate to trade it but if it doesn't get played I don't see much reason to keep it.

Great economic game with well interlocking shares & resource prices.
The constant adjustments of prices is not too bad to handle, however having the player aids available for each player is substantial for the flow of the game.

I finally found a good 2-player economy.  And it doesn't get this with "dummy" players or other cheesy patches games use to make 2-player economies.

It takes some getting used to.  But like a real economy, nothing happens in isolation.  So yeah, it's kinda fiddly, but it's worth it for what you get.

First Play: The game has alot of fiddly rules to get to grips with before you can start playing. There is a ground rush of oportunity and its not easy to steer a strategy early doors.However the fiddliness continues with various permutations of raising and lowering, share price, resource price and order numbers. Overall its just all too fussy.

As a couple of asides, the theme is as weak as it could possibly be. Venice? It could easily be any trading environment. Finally why is the board so small and the graphics lacking so much definition?

Overall I felt there was a clever game in there but the production and execution has significantly missed the mark.

Second Play: The tiny nature of the main board and the lack of iconography is a significant weakness in the design and build of this game. This time the game owner had built a four piece sectional board with text for each area. This made a world of difference but its astounding that the printed board survived play testing. It really is shockingly bad.

The game is still fussy and fiddly. What became more apparent this time around was the luck that could be doled out by the order cards. One player had completed 6, pat before the end of the 4th round whilst the rest of us struggled to achieve 2 by that stage. Pick up 3 which need 5-6 of the same colour and you are in deep trouble.

All in a game that requires considerable hard work, for very little satisfaction at game end. I would never buy this, I really wouldn't want to play it again.

This is one of the most complex games I've ever seen in my life.  I might get it to the table one day, I might not.

Traded:  Not that it's a bad game by any stretch.  It's just one of those games that would take one full game to learn, the next game to make mistakes.  By the 3rd game you might have an idea of what you're doing...  very depth, very complex.  This wouldn't be bad, but I really don't maintain a gaming group that plays and keeps with the same game week after week after week, which is what this game would really need to get that sense of appreciation it deserves.

The apt comment that I agree most with out of my geekbuddies is, "It's like 18xx in 90 minutes."  I think if the learning curve weren't so steep, it would/should easily be a top 200 here on bgg.

When I saw the announcement for this one, I was stoked, as we'd recently gotten into commodity speculation games and this one looked like it was the jack-of-all-trades of economic games.  Plus, couldn't believe the price given the components!  I pre-ordered it.

The game is really as close to feeling entrepreneurial as I've yet experienced (Loyang gives it a run for its money, but simulates less overall).  There's pick up and deliver, commodity speculation, auction... it's all there.  You really feel like the game is pretty wide-open in terms of ways you can make money and win.  That said, it might be a bit overwhelming for some; Ashar has commented that she still feels like she's swimming around, with no firm grasp on strategy.  I feel like I've got a sense for how to proceed in the early game: see what goods come up, buy stocks accordingly, and then get to it.  Yes, some aspects of the game are counter-intuitive (how the shops work to increase commodity value, for instance), and yes, it can be a might fiddly.  But it is very balanced and replayable, and very immersive.  I'm sure with more than two it's a real speculation frenzy, but with two it's quite a tight game.  Plus, the production value on this one is outstanding.  

One of those games that doesn't blaze any new ground, but takes some well-worn mechanics, mixes them together in a new way, and the engine just hums along very smoothly.

This is a novel, slightly quirky, take on the trading game genre. The production is high quality, other than the board - which is a bit on the small side and has non-obvious graphics that take a while to decipher.  While a thick coat of Ventian veneer has been applied (and I'm willing to believe it was inspired by Venetian history) the setting is pretty immaterial to the main flow of the game (as we've come to expect from 'Venice' games) though this at least features a gondola as a turn marker.  

Overall, this is a good gamers' game with lots going on and a fair bit to think about each turn, with a mixture of bidding, role selection and a type of worker placement. Lots to get a grip on before you can really get going but some of the tactics are graspable fairly quickly, if not the strategy.  The only problem is it's a bit footery to keep track of e.g. price, share and demand info and the rules for how they are affected by buying and selling goods aren't easy to internalise.  The end result is that it takes a bit too long and a bit more effort than I feel it should to deliver what it does, so it loses a point of rating for that.  Worth a play or two though - if you're more tolerant of footeriness and willing to play often enough to get the rules down pat you may well rate it a bit higher.

I'm a big fan of economic/commodity speculation/stock games, and this one provides all of them!  Lots of systems to mess with and strategize around.  I really enjoy being able to manipulate the various systems, and the balance between opportunistically making cash vs. filling guild orders for points is interesting.

Unfortunately, the rules are very obtuse, and no one ever remembers how to play if it's been longer than a few weeks between plays. Nothing is super logical, even though it works well once you "get it", but it just never gets played due to it being kind of a chore to relearn.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting economic game.  It's pretty to look at and the boards are easy to read once you know how.  The pegging system is a bit fiddly, but as RnR observed, the spots marked are safe from accidental rearrangement by jostling.  3 stats are tracked for 5 commodities: price, demand, and stock price.  Various buy/sell actions on the board can shift these stats.  For example, filling an order reduces demand, as resources appear on the docks the price drops, buying stocks increases the price but selling stocks decreases it more.  It might've been easier if the main board had been made larger and some of the information printed on it (i.e. dividends are paid if resources are sold at the shops) - but then you'd have a bigger price too.  

*If there aren't some summary player aids, I plan to make some for us.
*Probably not a good game for AP.  I could see some people calculating when and which peg to shift for each market, how it would affect them compared to other players for each and every rumor.

The game almost feels like 18XX game. There's a share price, and the price can go up or down depends on your actions. Also there's a different price for the product, so not only the share price. The only thing that makes this a lesser game is the luck (though not much, but 18XX has NO luck). But, the game makes a great use of blind bidding, simultaneous actions, stock market, and set collection (the only thing I'm not fond of).

A pretty serious economic game. You need to manage the price level of five companies' products, the value of their stocks, and the demand for orders. You also need to manage your own ownership of stock majorities in any or all of the companies.

There's quite a bit more to the game, too... role selection, simultaneous action selection, shared actions. It's all very well integrated.

It is, however, not at all intuitive at first. The game is not as complicated as it seems... but it takes a few rounds to settle in at all and have any inkling of what to try to do. (Make no mistake, though, this is a complicated game--just not as daunting as it seems after reading the rules and setting up for the first round.)

This is Puerto Rico meets 1830.  It really is a niche game where you have to have the right kind of people for it to go over well.  You need: a. hardcore gamers   b. fans of economic games  c. gamers who also enjoy some luck  d. gamers willing to chalk up the first couple of games as a learning experience...and play again soon.

So it's a tough combo. The game is very fiddly.  The rules are not that great.  Simply put, it is very easy to get key rules of goods and stock market movement wrong.

My group didn't like it. But with that said, I like it! I think it has a lot of potential and would really like to try it out again.  Sad because I don't own it, and I don't think the owner would ever bring it out again.

Very long (4 hours for our first game including rules reading), quite fiddly in all senses, but a not too taxing game of money and markets. The biggest problem I had was remembering when markers went up and down, and when you could or could not do things. Not my kind of game, but fairly pleasant in any case. With a better set of rules, a decent player aid, and experienced players, I could be persuaded to give it another go. The actual actions and decision making was nicely done, and the mix of inside/outside behaviours worked, making the turn order and timing much more important than we thought at first.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Components are an interesting mix of quality & cheapness: The shop boards & player dials are magnificent, and the dials come assembled (unlike some games);  Cardboard coins are punched, but a dozen missing; The Player Disks & Resource Cubes are wood, but the Pawns are light, generic plastic (which I will replace);  The wood Gondola is very nice but badly cracked.  The tiles & cards are heavy & nicely printed, but the board is a huge disappointment--The photos on BGG look very nice, but the board's colors don't match the rest of the game, it is hard to read, slightly warped, and very small (okay for 4 players, but too small for 5).

I haven't played yet, but looking forward to it.  Hoping the company will replace missing & broken pieces.

Excellent customer service got back to me within hours.  Will replace the gondola about which they expressed disappointment that quality control missed it; The coins are not missing--rules misprint.  Frank at R&R also told me number of errors in rules & error in Tax Collector card and to download corrections they have posted on BGG.  I have just printed out a fantastic Player Aide from R&R Games as well.  My opinion of the company & this game is improving, a lot.

There is some interesting stuff going on here, but ultimately Masters of Venice never earned a second play because (1) all the upkeep and peg adjustment is a major pain, and (2) there are simply too many other, better games we can spend our time playing.

Masters of Venice seems to be a finely tuned economic game, one that rewards careful planning and proper timing.  It offers players wide latitude in terms of strategy and options, and has some moments of excitement, tension and satisfaction.  However, it is burdened with an abundance of confusing rules and detailed accounting that requires constant moving of small pegs.  This detailed accounting is something that would be best handled by a computer application.  Indeed, that has been the general consensus of many of the gamers with whom I've played:  the game would make a better computer game than a board game.

Un juego económico sobre comerciantes de Venecia.
Los componentes están bastante bien, aunque yo encontré alguna inconsistencia, el tablero central podía ser un poco mas grande y las fuentes escogidas para los tableros eran demasiado artísticas y poco legibles.

El juego recompensa la planificación cuidadosa y ofrece a los jugadores una miríada de opciones. Uno de los problema del juego versa en la cantidad de administración que uno debe realizar en cada una de las acciones, mover peones por los tableros de acciones y recolocar peones y marcadores, algo muy de juego de ordenador.

Lo que arruina la experiencia para mi es que es un juego con diferentes mecánicas interrelacionadas que no han sido encajadas elegantemente y que por lo tanto el juego no se desarrolla fluidamente, la impresión general que me da es que es un juego al que le falta desarrollo y que no está pulido.

Too many levers to pull for too little payoff. The game was relatively brief, but exceptionally obtuse--one of those games where you spend an awful lot of time trying to internalize the nebulous connection between your actions and eventual success. Additionally, the game suffers from what I call the Catan Problem--the economy that drives the game is entirely dependent on goods that enter the game randomly.

It looks very, very euro, but it actually has a fairly strong stock element to the game.  This works in an unusual way; when players take action at a location, that affects its stock price. Locations also have the property of demand, which affects what can be delivered there.  This is a really interesting idea. There are a bunch of other mechanisms thrown in--nothing new, but they're put together in a way that makes the game a lot less generic than you'd think.  It's intriguing and counterintuitive, but ultimately, the length kills it.  At half the length, it's a really cool game with awesome components, but at the actual length--it's kind of a mess with a slightly wonky endgame.  (1 play)

Several plays now and a better understanding of how things work and the game is very interesting. The simultaneous  action selection makes for interesting turns since players can benefit from other players actions in some cases. The game is definitely fiddly and the first play through is definitely needed just to see how all the parts fit together. 

Some in the our group have a hard time accepting how the goods pricing is affected by the goods being sold or brought into play. There is a nice summary sheet which each player should get a copy of that shows the way pricing is adjusted and should aid in moving the game along.

The turn of play makes the game not very realistic, and the roles determine the actions. Too long (3-4 hours) considering what it offers.

For a stock game, Wealth of Nations is much better.

This is one of those games that gets better with familiarity. Don't give up on this game after one play.  There is a really good game here with lots of paths to victory.  Game is a little fiddly (you are constantly pegging and unpegging share/price/order board).  Lots to think about and balance if you want to do well.  Game could probably be played under 90 min if everyone is experienced.  Don't even bother trying to play without the player aid though.

Wow!   I love this game.  If you need a heavy yet fast playing and fluid stock game, this is it.  It even plays well with 2!

Looks great, it has a refreshing price, and I love the pegging.

I would ignore the people that call this fiddly.  The market moves and moves fast.

The first edition rules are not complete and a bit on the erroneous side.  Yet the author has been very diligent in posting and answering of questions.

Kudos!

Very interesting and complex euro economy game with a nice price mechanic, a stock holding component and some pick up and deliver. Recommended! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Meaty Economic Euro with some interesting ideas implemented.  Unfortunately, the economic system is more than a bit fiddly and the way in which the prices for resources and stocks rise and fall is not completely intuitive. Our first game saw everyone pursuing a guild order strategy with less focus on the stock market; the dangers of having your stock price undercut by other sellers makes the market very risky as a longterm strategy in a large mulitplayer game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We ended up getting this as somewhat of a surprise in a math trade.  We really hadn't played any hard economic games before, so this intrigued us, particulary since it sounded like it would work for two and didn't take too long to play.  

The components are pretty good and you get a lot that fits inside the relatively small box.  The gameplay reminded us of a more complex [thing=30380][/thing] (although that probably speaks more to the limited number of economic games we've played)---you have role selection, worker placement, shared actions, and different goods that you can obtain to fulfill orders/shipments.  The stock market mechanism is the new one for us.  It's a hard game to explain since everything interlocks together, but once you dive in, everything starts to make more sense.  One of the critiques of the game is the fiddliness of constantly moving the pegs.  We actually didn't mind that too much and it gave a tactile feeling of the price fluctuations.  I enjoyed how everything comes together and influences everything (the price of goods, the stock price, and the number of orders you can sell).  The designer-supplied player aid in the files section is mandatory to learning how to play, so make sure to get it.  

However, while the game works for two players, I'm not sure if that's the best number---each player only gets one action, so even if you pick a shared action, there just aren't enough turns to really get your stock market engine going.  You just don't get enough money or stock into the game to really affect the good or stock prices---one game, I tried to monopolize cloth and tried the best I could to raise the stock price to split it, but I couldn't get close.  As a result, in the two player game, it's usually easier to just fill guild orders, which makes the game a little more one dimensional.  She thinks it's okay, but with just two, the amount of work required doesn't return enough fun.  I quite like it, but I look forward to trying it with more to really get the feeling of a volatile market.

San Juan -> Race for the Galaxy -> Glory of Rome -> Masters of Venice.  Maybe GtR to MoV is too much of a jump in general, but progress speaks well for pvp screwage.  

Role selection with bidding.  My only game so far with a stock market mechanic.

Pretty tight with 2 players.  One wrong strategic move can easily spiral into a loss.  Only unknowns/luck variables: rumors, other player's Guild Orders, and what resources gets drawn out of the bag.

We like this game.

To say Masters of Venice game is "complicated" would be the understatement of the year.  This is a complex stock market game where basically anything and everything you do affects the stock price of the goods and shops of both you and your opponents.  This game takes a while for the mechanics to sink in (not to mention how long it takes for the strategy to kick in), but unfortunately, I have virtually no desire to put in the time required to truly explore all the little subtleties of the game.  It seems quite solid with interesting and compelling mechanics, but I don't have fun while playing it and thus probably won't play again.  It's a good game, but it's not for me.

Turned out better than I think any of us anticipated, especially considering the comments I have read.  The game length really seems to be exaggerated, as we played a three player game in ninety minutes, and nobody had played before.  Quite a lot going on and figuring out what to do was tough at first but as the gameplay cleared up a bit, we found lots of things we could do to make it interesting.  We rather underused the rumors and nobody used the favors, but still it was quite a battle.

What a painful economic game. There are so many better options out there. I imagine I'd like it better if the game had half the number of rounds. It's biggest problem is that you aren't building anything. From the start of the game to the end, you are just picking up goods and build orders, and spinning the engine. The market was unintuitive and it felt flaccid.

Having read some reviews and comments, I was prepared not to like this game as I'm not fond of economic games and complex games with too many decisions. However, I really like the design. Its actually not too complex at all and the stock market manipulation stuff is just a means to an end as its ALL about the Guild. I tried to experiment with different strategies and learned my lesson that everything is secondary to the Guild. The mechanics are not too difficult and the player aid is very useful. A very tactile game with excellent components in the excellent production. A gorgeous looking game.

Updated (2/2012): I really like the gameplay and the game's several interlocking systems. It reminds me a bit of 18xx. It's like 18xx-mini. But the rounding for scoring kind of bothers me. It introduces an additional level of calculation that ends up just being tedious, and doesn't seem to add any particularly interesting depth to the game. I wish final scores were just total value of assets (stocks plus cash on hand), +100 per "point" earned by guild contracts, less half the value of any unused resources and 200 for each unfulfilled contract.

Personally, I think I'd be able to analyze the game state more easily if the shop boards were redesigned into a single board with sliders, but that's not terribly important.

Old: I think I'm going to like this, but it seems like the limited number of turns makes this a little too short. Like you don't have quite enough time to actually see many plans to fruition, or for the supply-and-demand to really balance itself out.

We struggled with the rules a little on this one.  With everyone starting with a color of player and a color of goods, it was a little hard to keep track of who was what.  We forgot some of the rules which made it very hard to accomplish much in the first few rounds.  By the end everyone had caught on and it moved at a decent pace.  The economy has a lot of aspects here, and I like the roll selection, but it felt a little too noisy to me.  I will stick with Chicago Express most the time to satisfy my stock buying cravings.

In short, you're trying to collect cubes and then sell them at the shops for money or deliver contracts with them for VPs. The essence though is the simultaneous revelation of what actions people are going to take. Most actions are shared - if one person's picking up resources, everyone is, in turn order. The trick to the game is learning how to take advantage of other people's actions. There are different strategies to try - investing in colours that are about to be delivered to receive dividends, concentrating on contract deliveries, concentrating on shipping houses for free cubes. It's nice that there are strategies to explore, room for thought and possibilities for cleverness, but I've never played a game with so much fiddliness - adjusting prices and orders and share prices up and down with every cube revelation and every sub-move it seems. There's a job here for a full-time accountant.

This is in my top 10. This great economic action-selection game may replace Puerto Rico for my family. Plays about 40 minutes per player. I love the Gondolier/Gondolieri mechanic. I also love the Shop boards with the peg value tracks, and how so many choices will affect those values constantly.

This game shines when 3 or more play, but this plays very well as a 2 player game, too.

The learning curve is such that everything clicks at least halfway through the first game.

This is a cool economic game that I played once.  I was utterly lost amid the various options.  I like the fact that there is genuine strategy: it seems you can win by selling good and bumping shares, or by filling orders.  But I don't much like the simultaneous action selection.  Overall, I think the game would have been improved by some streamlining of the mechanics.

The words "fiddly economic game" don't usually send me running, but the bureaucracy in this game was so large that it really seemed to detract from the game.  Every single thing that a player did required a change on the three different tracks for that good.  The types of changes were not always intuitive, and even with player aids from BGG we got confused sometimes.  Beyond that, the game was fairly opaque, and it seemed difficult to come up with some sort of coherent strategy.  As such, the end scores were very tightly spaced.  There might be more of a game here than I experienced, but it's not easy to find.

Great commodity and stock speculation game. Somewhat fiddly and sometimes hard to keep track of everything that can influence stock price/goods prices/demand for goods but I guess this is a tradeoff for such a deep and interesting economic game. Also I am not yet conviced if the point track was really needed in this design - why not just make money the only thing that counts. I understand that there was a need to make players short on cash at times, but maybe it could be done so without the point track also?

This is a tough stock market game, where players buy and sell not only stocks, but goods that are connected to those stocks. Each time a transaction is made, the values of the goods, stocks and/or demand for those things adjust. The game has role cards that give players special powers for the round. You also have a fascinating turn order mechanism that I don't have the words to properly summarize here. Some actions get shared among all players, and others you do by yourself, and predicting where people go with their secret simultaneous action selection dial is incredible.

The part of the game that loses me other than the somewhat poor component quality, is that at the end of the game the first player to flush their stocks out causes a nose-dive in value for the other players who hold the stock. There's no reason I can see not for every player to do an end game flush for this reason, which gives the game a feeling of playing chicken that I don't enjoy very much. Turn order at the end of the game can apparently be devastating.

Not complex as many commenters noted. I taught this game to a group of Italians in Venice. The rules explanation took half an hour because one friend was translating me. The game went smoothly except for when we had to modify values of goods and shares, the logic of which runs counter to reality.

A stock market or commodity speculation mechanic must be attached to a compelling game. In this game, these mechanics are attached to a Puerto Rico engine stripped of its soul. You only sense of progression in this game is increasing capital, which pales in comparison to the different kinds of powers you accumulate in PR.

----------

Fantastic game mixing elements of pickup/deliver, commodity speculation, stock market, action drafting, and role selection.  

The thing I love most about the game:  nothing is scripted. There are so many different paths that you can take during the game; it's just so open-ended.  New players tend to be overwhelmed by the initially opaque strategies and therefore gravitate toward the more obvious Guild Order cards, but it's entirely feasible to win this game playing the investor and manipulating the market to your advantage (caveat:  2p games tend to be much more focused on Guild Orders since commodities don't see nearly as much action as they would in a 3p+ game).  

I also get the feel of an 18xx game (stock pump and dump) in less than 90 minutes.  Awesome!

I wish more people knew about this gem.  It's a fantastic game... and unbelievably cheap!!! So much value at its price point.  At the low price, you owe it to yourself to give the game a shot.  

This is my #3 game.

Played a five player game for the first time without player aids. It was late and my brain was not firing on all cylinders so I dont think it would be fair to rate this harshly. I feel the mechanics behind the game were sound but I agree with one other players comment that there was too much noise in the various actions. I agree that this game seems fiddly but that does not make or break a game. It truly is just a descriptor.

My biggest problem is that it didnt seem fun to me? It is a hardcore economic game with fairly straight forward decisions and tactics. Buy low, sell high, obtain the right stocks and fulfill orders. To be honest, I spend all day looking at numbers and code and it felt like I was at work. If financial games excite someone then maybe this is up their alley, however I would rather build towns and ships, grow crops, shoot guns, and swing swords any day. Buy stocks... not so much.

Masters represents my least favorite type of game design.  Make a game that looks pretty and appears heavy.  Make the rules long and complicated, then paste on some non-intuitive ideas to try and make the whole thing work.  The result:  a game that drags on, is too fiddly, non-intuitive, and features and endgame bereft of any drama.  If a game is long and fiddly, takes a while to learn, but grips you so that you don't notice the time flying by, then the payoff is worth it.  Otherwise you have a big, shiny mess.  Ugh.

This is an interesting stock market game, deeper than most and rich with theme and player options. However, there's a pretty steep learning curve, even for experienced players, and getting into the rhythm of doing the necessary upkeep in terms of adjusting market demand and prices really takes some getting used to and will be considered fiddly by some players. Very worthwhile for folks who relish a deep commodity/stock game, but I'd recommend assembling a group of veteran gamers ... Masters of Venice is going to overwhelm the typical newbie.

I love the gameplay and the mechanics. Lots of pieces and counters to keep track of, but after awhile everything just flows in perfect harmony.

Dry economic game with tedious, fiddly flow of play and difficult to absorb rules. Nothing new, just a very familiar process of turning goods into money into goods to fulfill VP contracts.

One of the fiddliest games I've played. Enjoyable, but I'm not completely certain the fun outweighs the time spent adjusting prices with every single action players take. I could see this getting a *lot* faster with computer moderation.

The economic model is somewhat unintuitive, but once you get your head around things, there are a lot of very nice interlocking mechanisms.

Good but probably not a classic for the ages.

i've never had such a hard time grasping the rules to a game.  it was really dry and theres a lot of mechanics that you can just completely ignore and still be a strong contender.  i never messed with stocks at all and still tied for first (lost the tie breaker to not having the most money).  the other person had a ton of stocks.

Beautiful and interesting game.  Very nice components a bargain.  Rules are fairly straight forward, but you really have to play the game to see how everything works.  My wife and I had no idea how to make points, but towards the end we were starting to get it.  Not for the AP prone!  5 players games could take far to long.  Two player seemed just fine.  I don't know how often this will hit the table.  Looking forward to playing again soon though.

A fairly good game with some fun mechanics, options and gameplay.  However, I feel this game is complex for the sake of being complex - I think a lot of the aspects (especially all of the constantly adjusted variables) of this don't really add much to the game, and aren't worth the excessive complexity and fiddly-ness.

Essentially I'd say this could be a better game if some of it was streamlined and made less complicated - it could still have the same depth with simpler rules and faster gameplay.

Want to play this a few more times, really started to see how it interacted mid to late game.  I think this rating will go up.

RATING: N/A
Only played it the once so far. Most of that game was spent trying to remember "does this peg up or down when we do that?" or "do we move just the resource cost, or the share price too?". Also, it's a bit overwhelming, as you know what you can do, but you're not entirely sure of why you want to do something, and what effect it will have over the long haul.

This will definitely move up as we become more familiar with everything. It's an incredible value, so cheap for what you get. Board could be just a touch bigger, but I'm guessing they couldn't do a foldable board with the pegholes.

Sold without playing again.

Intricate and interesting, but the rules are not particularly helpful. Dividends seem to add more fuss than value. Very hard to get on the table, and yet...can't give up on it.

Once I get used to the fiddly-ness, and can see through the opaque strategies, and can teach this better, I'll give it an 8...the value of the components and the good game I know is there, once you get past the steep learning curve, make this game worth the low price.
UPDATE:
With the player-aid, the strategy guide, the errata and 2 plays under my belt, I'm upping this from a 7.5 to an 8.
I'm confident I can teach this game now and with a good banker/caller, the fiddly-ness is no worse than say, a bit above Power Grid...plus the strategy guide really helped to show us how to play well.
Now I get it!

Another ambitious game which features a huge mish-mash of mechanics.  There is blind bidding for role selection and turn order; simultaneous action selection with a dial similar to the one used in El Grande; hidden order fulfillment like Traders of Genoa; then you got commodities and stock market manipulation as well as majority control in shops.  What turns out isn't exactly a mess, but the gameplay is far from streamlined.

Extremely fiddly with many things to keep track of, apparently there isn't really any one strategy to speak of to do well in the game.  Instead, all you need is to learn how to juggle many of the balls at once.  As long as you're able to complete several guild orders and buy in a couple of lucrative shares, you'll probably do just as well as anybody at the table.

Unnecessarily complex and boring busywork makes Masters of Venice a medicore fare.

Interesting game with quite the market fluctuation elements.  It's prone to human error in the bookkeeping, and a little tedious to keep up; however, as a computer implementation, it should be pretty interesting.  The complexity would still be there, and the players would need to understand what things their choices would affect in the market, but it would take significantly less time to play....

RATING: 7
Almost a classic piece of world building fantasy literature in it's own right although the camp comedy fails to ignite some humour detectors. A game that works on several different levels. As well as masssive multiplayer campaign games it has some good two player scenarios and plenty of scope for more. It's also one of the few games that has a workable 3 player scenario. Important when I was younger. It falls down somewhat on the combat resolution system which is at the wrong scale for the game and plays more like a tactical battle game on a strategic map. Still a fun game but could do with a massive update and probably swtched to an area movement system.

RATING: 4
Would rate it higher but for the self-indulgent 'humor' which essentially killed any suspension of disbelief necessary for the fantasy element to succeed other than on a basis of an elaborate joke. An opportunity wasted.

The rules are more complex than War of the Ring and magic is more present (not just abstracted) but some units (orcs) are underrated and unplayable in team play. 
The quest rules are excellent and fit in well in the game.

This rating only applies to the wargame, not the campaign game, which I've never tried. I love this game's scenarios, characters, tone and playability. It isn't the best designed wargame and, given that it is nearly 30 years old now, it is pretty traditional, but it certainly merits an 8.

RATING: 8
Almost 32 years ago I played this game twice and since then it keeps hunting me. Was it my youth? Was it the star wars and fantasy readings or was it really, really good. Too long ago to give this an objective score. But it felt GOOD to command all those fantasy creatures. So perhaps I should give it an 11 !

I could finally buy it a few months ago in Sep 2012 on ebay from a UK person. Incredible really, I was searching for this baby for 30 years and now the box stares at me on my desk ... :) 

I earned the money to buy it by ... playing a Fantasy video game btw: Diablo 3. Incredible that you now can make money by playing an on line video game and invest that money in those epic old board wargames. 

Happy. :)

A wargame in a fantasy setting, it has interesting mechanics and sceanrios.  You can decide if you like the puns or not. Leaders are very powerful and have a key impact.

Biggest flaw we found was that using magic in combat was so strong, we rarely cast the oodles of spells that came with and it may be overpowered; and maybe a little high on the chrome factor.  But it actually was a real nice game!

RATING: 5
Another of those "classic games from the 70s" that has aged somewhat badly. Laced with quirky humor, which is pretty amusing in and of itself. However, complicated by today's standards for little payoff, long, and particularly poor multi-player as the downtime is a significant problem. Still, good for a try, although Freedom in the Galaxy is better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The puns built into the game, like forests called "Evelyn Woods" and "Natalie Woods" (celebrities of the day) and characters called "X the Unknown" (algebra joke) etc doomed this game to be appealing only to people with a particular sense of humor.  Sold it but kept the cool looking counters for use in Albion: Land of Faerie variants.

RATING: 5
Kind of an odd mix of old hex & counter 70's style wargaming, and a rather innovative (not to mention amusing) character & magic system. The idea of having mana power wax or wane based on the rising and setting of three different colored suns is brilliant.

Unfortunately, the game has some serious issues. The game is a little on the dry side owing to the lack of any real tactical flavor, and the direct magic is overpowered. Many of the scenarios are not particularly balanced and/or have some wonky VP issues. Lastly, the diplomacy rules don't really work right owing to the way emissaries work and the limited time you have in the scenarios.

These days I think you're better served by some of the newer tactical fantasy games, or dungeon crawlers if you're interested in that aspect instead. This game just doesn't hold up today.

Probably my favorite game. Two games in one, with the army game beinbetter than the rpg quest game. Though there are quite a few typos, and the humor is a bit dated, I have always come back to this game for some quick fun, and have been doing so since I got my hands on my first copy back in 1984. Alot of potential for house rules and expansion also. For a not-so-serious bit of wargame fun, to me this is a must have.

2015 We have logged 3 games of this in the last year and it is a favorite of our >40 crowd.  That said, it could use a re-write and for God's sake larger hexagons and counters!  :-)

Feb-2013 Update: Whooohooo received a VERY nice copy!  Perhaps a bit musty from the 80s but 95% *UNPUNCHED*!!  Looks like the wimps tried one scenario (orcs VS elves by the look if it) and went back to Yatzee.  :P

If you don't like it you are either too young or too old!!  ;)

A favorite from the days of Yore.  The source of my BGG Avatar.  Multiman Publishing has announced a new edition of this game.  The 2nd edition will be true to the original but changes are being made.  Area movement will replace the hex grid.  Other changes are planned as well.  The new version looks interesting.

RATING: 3
This game may well have been quite good in its day but it is dated now.  It reminds me very much of the "kitchen sink" design style of the 70's (in fact it recalls the 1970's D&D DMG in its attempts to include a whole bunch of fairly clever ideas into a system that begins to topple under its own weight if anyone really attempts to play it nowadays).  I wonder how many ratings here are based on nostalagia and would be revised if the game was actually played today.  Leadership values in combat far outweigh the value of actual tactical manuevers and attempting to achieve numerical superiority.  My only play was mulitplayer where downtime was a major issue so that may have soured my opinion somewhat.

A classic game.  The army game has a number of nice scenarios that can be played quickly by 2 or more players.  For its time, the world and background was fairly extensive and even today it is still a "breathable" world.  A fun diversion that everyone should try at least once to see how SPI tried to merge a role-playing experience with a traditional 1970s-1980s war game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Limited stacking means armies form big swirling masses. Combat system doesn't really work in this situation - it's difficult for a large force of relatively weak units to fight against a couple of strong units. I wish someone had combined the quest and army games.

RATING: 6
A mixed bag here. On one hand, the army game is a decent wargame if you tone down the magic. I remember when I played this as a kid and being able to summon demons but couldn't bind them and then they would kill my own leader! There are a broad range of scenarios which vary in terms of play balance (I remember the spiders being especially difficult to win with). 

Then there is a hybrid boardgame/RPG which I fiddled around with as a kid but didn't find especially interesting and stuck with the army game instead. I think there are some play balance issues with those scenarios as well but I may be remembering that wrong.

Is it a game that I would play now? Probably not. I am fine with the humor and the way each race has its own unique skills and abilities is interesting. However, the downtime is a killer and about half of the scenarios are unbalanced. Again, the magic is overpowered in this game and would need to be toned down. I remember X the Unknown being a one-man army because of his magic skills.

In the end, it was fun as a kid but without a major revision, I couldn't see myself playing this one again. I would rate it lower but I did enjoy it as a kid, so I gave it a couple of points for the fond memories.

Edit 5/17: Well, I saw this at a market here in Derry for cheap, so I bought it. I have always said "never say never"!

Really, a better game than my rating gives it, but again I am rating if I'd PLAY it. Also hurt by SPI's tongue in cheek names and rules, never taking the fantasy side the respect true fantasy players would want. So, it did not do all that well. I think it also hurt them later, when they DID want to do fantasy with DargonQuest, and potential players remembered the smarta** names in this game.

This is my favourite game, and surprisingly simple once play is underway. I've found that the most useful spell (in the Army game) is usually "Fear" that demoralizes a unit up to 7 hexes away. Here's a tip: cut several strips 9cm long from the stencil upon which the die-cut counters were mounted, and use them to represent Force Wall hexside or destroyed wall in the game by placing a strip along the applicable hexside.

A very fun, very playable fantasy wargame with a lot of various scenarios for different imaginary fantasy wars. The game comes with it's own histories for the whole event and what isn't mentioned anywhere in the game is one of the single greatest inside jokes of the game. The city of Urf Durfal was Greg's little personal joke he would ink in on any and all playtest maps at SPI any time he got a chance. It was on the War in the East map and even the Invasion: America map. Finally when he got a game design for a fantasy campaign, he was able to actually name a city Urf Durfal and have it make it out in print. ;) cute move Greg.

worth while if only for the killer penguins.

Another game that feels dated.  I want to replace the system with something like Britannia/ChariotLords/HotW (as  (1) it has several nations that enter the board at various locations and (2) no one has done a fantasy theme yet for Britannia's game system). Should be easy.  As an alternative for the more ambitious, give it the 'We the People' system.

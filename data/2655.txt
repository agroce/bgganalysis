This has pretty good replayability for an abstract. And the most awesome tiles ever. Perfect game to take on a picnic. I could probably grow to like it more if I put my mind to it but at the moment, the rating seems just about right.

Sort of like a lite version of chess.  Easy to learn, but with lots of tactic.  Far easier than chess to understand, making it much more child friendly.  If you want a thinking game, this is it.  (no luck, just strategy)

A fun two-player strategy abstract. Has a similar feel as chess. Can be draining in the same way as chess (though Hive takes much less time to play).

This game is a winner! The bits are very nice to handle, portable, and are quite durable. Game play is engaging but game time is short, allowing you to play this one a few times in one sitting.

Perfect game to play while enjoying a few cold ones at your local watering hole!

RATING: 9
Simple chess for people who don't like chess. Think the first player is too much? Then have both players deploy four pieces, with the queen being the fourth piece, then before playing further review the board and give the option to the second player to switch sides and become first player if he chooses. Other than the first player advantage complaint I've heard which might be valid, this game is excellent with no chance or randomness, fun and fast, the aesthetics are great, and the components are high quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:
Enjoyable abstract game. Thinky chess-like play. Lovely tactile components. Can be played on any surface including the beach. No set up. Unique insect theme. 

Cons:
Always seems to come down to each player pinning the other's "arms" with ants for a large portion of the game. The game can sprawl in any direction, including off the edge of the table! 

N.B.
Hive was my favourite abstract for a while. Still a great game. Only ever play it now on Board Game Arena.

A very enjoyable chess-type game, very easy to learn and fun to play. A typical game usually only lasts 5-15 minutes so you can get a couple games in when time is short. The bakelite peices make it easy to play anywhere and you don't have to worry about wrecking your game, really a "take and play anywhere" game.

I wanted to like this game much more than I did. It is a very dry abstract, and while clever and quick, there is nothing here to hold me.

Very chesslike feel - one mistake and you are dead. Usually I don't like that kind of games because it's just too agonizing to ponder every move thoroughly, but Hive is an exception. This due to the short playing time and the limited number of moving parts.

A bit of a mixed bag this one.

Positives:
it's quick - you could play several games in twenty minutes
it looks good
it's portable (you could play it in a pub etc)
there is a fair bit of skill
kids can play it with adults
it's quick to learn
it's good for the price
it's quite fun

negatives:
the end seems to be obvious several turns ahead
some of the moves of both attack and defence seem a bit scripted
it's maybe too quick

I like it and am glad it's in my collection.  It has a few uses.  I don't think it's a classic.

Good semi abstract game. There is a little problem of predictability in the end of the game, and it is really fast, I wanted this game to be a bit more complex because I enjoyed the idea of the game but the resolution of it seems so fast.

Edit: My previous rate was 7, I increased it because of the expansions that I thought add a lot to the game, essentially the Pillbug that put a bit more of complexity to the game and makes the attack less powerful than before.

I used to think "Hive's a great game; but watch out:  it is definitely (at least it seems right now) attack-oriented."  Which made it not [i]her[/i] favorite game...  But we enjoyed it fairly often at first.

Unfortunately, now I think "Hive's a game with a cool idea, and cool pieces, and repetitive play based on abusing beetles and ants."  The depth looks to have gone away, mostly.  Maybe we're missing another level, but I sort of suspect we're not -- just slightly better tactics for getting the beetle and ant where they need to be for the kill.  Sigh.  Playing some with the AIs reinforces this belief.

Hive is an interesting little brain burner that has a wonderful play time. With most games clocking in under 30 minutes, how can you go wrong? I love the fluid nature of the board/game and it's true that the more I play this little gem the deeper the game gets.

It's rarely something that gets played just once. The most often phrase I hear after I have played a game of Hive is: "One more game?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Mechanically, it works fine; but it's kinda dull. A little too simplistic, and there's just not that much to do! I much prefer Chess over Hive, which for me is saying a lot! The only advantage Hive has is that the game's over and done with quite quickly. It's the time factor that keeps me from rating Hive even lower.

Cute two-player game. Portability is a plus! Play anywhere and everywhere with a flat surface. The pieces are heavy and durable. A perfect beach game: neither wind nor water will hurt this little gem. However, I am still only formulating good strategies, and I'm wondering about replayability... It is certainly simpler than chess, but much in the same genre.

A game with a feel similar to chess, but the board is "free flowing."  You create the board as you place your pieces and there are movement restrictions, but no outer 'boundary' for the board.

Hive is a decent game. But after getting past the learning curve I feel like I'm constantly making the same choices when I play. Maybe there's more strategic space I haven't found yet. I may just need new opponents. But the design doesn't really grab me enough to really seek that out.

This is a great game for people who like chess-style strategy.  Only this is with bug images imprinted on thick bakelite hex tiles, and there is actually no board.  Each bug has a different way of moving, with the goal being to completely surround the opposing player's queen bee.  Deep play out of simple rules (much like chess), and high replayability.  Great value.

RATING: 7.5
Modern, miniature chess.

It feels a bit "swarmy", where either you immediately zerg and knock out the other player, or get into a bind where you're both just wriggling around trying to find an opening and the game stretches out with no obvious end in sight. So, I do prefer the Gipf games, Dvonn, Tzaar, and Zertz on that basis. But I do like how well it does play on average and the thematic underpinnings.

UPDATE: My wife likes this one a fair bit. It's quick and pretty easy and luckless. I'm annoyed by the beetle blocking the queen ... I understand you need to prevent that from even happening, but I don't like having to exert so much effort just to thwart a single strategy, which drops the game a notch. Otherwise, fun. Not my favorite fast 2er, but portability is nice.

--------------------------------------------------------

We messed up a rule that you can't place your pieces next to an opponent's, which is obviously a crucial rule.

I'm not much for abstracts and I didn't think my wife would be either, but the mechanisms for this one are really interesting. It feels like there's a pretty big decision space for a game this simple and quick.

The decision of when to introduce your powerful ants and how to use your less powerful spiders and such is pretty fascinating. I tend to "save" my big guns, while my wife will often bring ants out early.

One thing that bothered me was that in one game I was pretty obviously outplaying my opponent but all my pieces got locked except for a lone beetle. I was nearly just sitting there as she brought the rest of her pieces out and started descending on my queen. Fortunately, I was able to get my beetle to unblock some pieces that gave me a win. Obviously, an experienced player would avoid getting blocked like this, but I didn't like how that played out.

RATING: 6
Without doubt, Hive is a very clever design.  The requirement for a piece to remain connected is at the heart of the game, but the various bug movement abilities create interest also.  It certainly meets the goal of all abstracts; great strategic depth with a minimum of rules.  And yet.  

And yet, I don't enjoy playing it very much.  I think that my problem with Hive is the very incremental nature of victory.  I have to surround your bee with pieces; that takes multiple turns of incremental progress.  This is death by slow strangulation and I prefer games that at least have the potential for the quick rapier thrust.

My set had bakelite pieces and they were very nice indeed, a great improvement on wood blocks with labels.

Hive stands out for having great components, a truly unique theme, and innovative elements.  I conceptually really want to love Hive, but I'm just not that drawn to playing it.  Perhaps it falls into the common trap of abstract 2-player games with out stochastic elements or handicaps - it's only really fun with an opponent of similar ability (think chess).

I would recommend Hive as a great present for kids (or adults) who like chess.

RATING: 8
I don't know if I'll ever volunteer for another game of Chess again, as long as Hive is available.  Hive doesn't make my brain hurt like a lot of other abstracts. It's just the right length and complexity for a quick go before a flight.  The tiles look and feel great.  This is one of the games the the folks I work with always ask to borrow from me.  All the new guys that come into my shop have to learn it for lunchtime battles!

I never ever get bored playing this game. I've been playing it since the beginning and I own all versions. It's fun, very educational, mind stimulating and it looks damn good.

I can't wait to get my hands on my very own copy of Hive Carbon, although I have played a real demo version of it and it's so lovely and it looks so chic. I also played with the unpolished Bakelite version and I liked it a lot. It gave it that rough look, however it won't be going into production because it would probably get too dirty with finger prints and all.

Gen42 Games keep on producing great games that are both fun and stimulating at the same time. They recently designed another game called Junkyard Races which will be out soon and once again I can't wait to get my hands on a copy of that.

I've only played this a couple of times, I can't get my girlfriend or any of the family to play it after the initial playing. Personally I really liked the game, quite deep and lots of tactics. My girlfriend said it was too much like chess and she also said, which made me laugh, that she didn't like it because when I beat her it felt as if she'd put a lot of thought into the game only to get beat. Which she hated... Women eh!. My mother found it too complicated even though she plays Settlers of Catan. Good game in my opinion none the less.

Update: It never saw the table so I sold it as an excuse to buy other games.

Why the hell is everybody so rough with the pieces? Every player I introduce Hive to feels the need to grab a tile and drop it from several inches onto the table - stop that!

Unnecessary roughness aside, Hive is fantastic. Takes under five minutes to explain, only a game or two to wrap your head around how the it works in a holistic sense, and everybody I've taught has asked for 'one more game.'

On an additional note, you know those little wooden Zen stress balls? The clacking sound they make when you fondle them in your palm is the sound of placing Hive tiles. Relaaaaaaxing...

Initially, I was not to impressed.  But this game grows on you like, an insect hive on your house in the summer.  Part of me was worried about the potential limitations of not having a board, but after a few games, I figured out, Hive skillfully uses this disadvantage as part of its strategies.  While simple, complexity arrises from its ability to be adaptable, with lots of interesting piece movements, which add flavor and variation.  And the ability for the player to customize his own games.  Small parts, big game!

For some times a did not dare to buy the games because it is a very abstract 2 player strategy game (like chess or go which are both not my pice of cake...).
But user Kaluga convinced me to try it out and I am glad he did!
Hive is a very enjoyable game, which is easy to teach and to play. It looks very interesting and the components are of great quality (both the full and the pocket version).
There are some nice expansions available (Ladybug and Mosquito which are already included in the Pocket version). The latest expansion is the Pillbug (got it from Essen 2013 for both versions). 
I am still a beginner and I believe a professional would play me in the ground but as long as the two player are of similar experience there is a lot of fun.
The setup time is extremely short (maybe 30 seconds). And it needs only 10 to 20 minutes to play it therefore it could be played several times in a row.
See also my comments for Hive Pocket the travel edition..
Plays count for both versions.

Ich hatte lange einen großen Bogen um dieses Spiel gemacht, da ich dieses abstrakte Spiel zu sehr in der Nähe von Schach und Go gesehen hatte. Erst die massiven Empfehlungen von Kaluga hat mich dazu bewogen mir Hive zu kaufen. Und ich habe es nicht bereut:
Diese Reiseversion ist wirklich sehr schön, praktisch und vollständig. 
Die Stein sind nicht zu klein und leicht und können immer noch sicher im Freien zum Spielen verwendet werden. Durch das insgesamt geringe Gewicht und dem schönen Säcken kann man das Spiel überall mit hinnehmen (auch in den Urlaub oder zur Arbeit). Im Gegensatz zur großen Version sind in der Reiseversion schon der Marienkäfer und der Muskito enthalten.
Das Spiel spielt sich schnell (bisher 10 bis 15 Minuten). Die Regeln sind einfach. Und man kann schnell mit dem Spielen anfangen. Gegn Profis sieht man wahrscheinlich genau so alt aus wie beim Schach oder Go aber hier macht es mir nicht so viel aus, da ein Spiel sehr kurz ist. 
Was mir als Hive-Anfänger jedoch besonders Spaß macht ist das gemeinsame Erlernen des Spiels mit anderen Anfängern.

This is a great game for two players. The pieces are very solid and well designed. The strategy of the game is reminiscent of chess, but is so unlike chess that no one should be turned away by the comparison. I will say this: if you want this game, splurge for the expansions. They are worth it and it may be cheaper to buy the Carbon version than assemble them piece-meal.

[abstract, 2p, 15-60min]  Pocket edition.

==2017-11-07==
Hive is a great game that I don't want to play.  The laborious consideration of each move for minutes and minutes makes the game drag on.  A single game of Hive (when played well) is very satisfying, but leaves me drained afterward.  I usually need at least a month before I'll even consider playing it again.

One user made a magnetic set to be hung on a wall, so that he and his SO could play-by-email the game.  That might be the best way to offset the analysis paralysis that this game requires.

==2018-01-30==
I actually really, really want to teach this game to (my future) children.  I don't know if I'd play this with my friends, but it seems like a great teaching tool.

I believe that I don't need any abstracts other than this.

I like Hive a lot, though that's because I like chess a lot. There is a lot of depth to this game, though it plays faster than chess. It's very easy to learn, and should be more accessible to people than chess. The expansions give it depth close to chess, though that in turn makes the game run longer. Sometimes I wonder though if the strategies and tactics become too repetitive, in other words, though games play out differently, you must do pretty much the same thing every game.

RATING: 7
An abstract game in which the insect theme is entirely unneccesary (although it helps to identify the pieces).  The game's strength is in the amoeba-like board composed enitrely of the moving pieces.  It is free-form yet managable and gives a strong feeling of fluidity.  Quick, fun game for 2 and addictive enough to drive players to try "just 1 more time..."  [GTI Code: APSD]

RATING: 7
Tentative rating which should go up.  I need to get more play on this.  There is a bit of a learning curve to pick up the tactics.  I got repeatedly smoked by someone who has a extensive chess background.  Right now, I am just not very good at this game, which causes lessened enjoyment.

Rather on the fence about this one - while I love the concept, pieces and boardless play, the rules also feels broken and poorly playtested. The main issues are the overpowered ants, the useless spiders and the general lack of defensive options, which makes it boil down to a simple race to cover the queen.

My favorite abstract. I like the board-less design, especially how the hive transforms over the course of the game, through the manipulation of pins. It seems sad that stalemates exist in the game, but some simple rules make them far less likely. The game also looks like it won't be easy to solve, which is quite important for this genre in particular. The components are great, but I'm quite annoyed at the price of the expansions. I almost wish I got the Carbon or Pocket editions.

RATING: 6
A home-made version.  The idea of completely disparate insects acting as a "hive" was slightly irksome to me (I used to be an entomologist), so I made a set consisting entirely of different castes of ants.  (Queen, soldiers, workers, nursers, breeders.)

Estupendo juego. No de los míos y sin embargo genial. Muy buenos componentes, y mecánica muy sutil y elegante. partidas cortas, facil explicación de reglas y adictivo. Tiene muchos ingredientes que me chiflan, y sin embargo la receta no es perfecta por lo mismo... no deja margen de error, tipo ajedrez. La cagas y se ve, y eso no es para mí. Tiene que haber gente que le chifle..
Perfecto el dia que se lo presenté a Emilio (ex-jugador bastante bueno del ajedrez).. a la tercera partida, después de 30 minutos forzando las tablas y a la defensiva, logró que yo acabara cometiendo un error (yo ya con mis buenas partidas a cuesta) y acabó ganando la  partida él. Eso dice mucho:
- Excelente juego
- Gran contrincante
- no me gustan este tipo de jugos ni contrincantes...

While it does create situations where players can win or lose by "oops", I think at this point my opponents and I are beyond that. And like my other highly rated games, Hive has qualities that draw me back to it repeatedly.

A modular chess game.  I like chess, so it makes sense I like this. Each insect has a specific move (just like chess) and the goal is to capture the opponent's queen bee (just like chess- no, there is no queen bee in chess, but you get the idea).  The only difference is the modular nature of the game (there is no board) and this makes it interesting enough to have both.

Solid abstract game with a wonderful theme.  My sons love playing "the bug game," and they're getting pretty good at it, too!

The only drawback is understanding how the individual pieces actually move; the spider in particular is a bit tricky.  Fortunately [url=http://www.hivemania.com/]playing the free "virtual" game online [/url] (it's the full game for one player) helps in this respect.

Gameplay-wise, it's probably more like an "8," but I give the new version with the Bakelite tiles an extra point.  Think old-style [i][thing=2394]Dominoes[/thing][/i].  The tactile feel of the pieces, as well as the various paint colors for the different insects (and arachnid), really add to our enjoyment of this game.  A fun game that can be played on any flat surface, and portable to boot!

NEW!
My near 7-year-old came to me tonight asking me to play Hive with her.  She played it with my 12-year-old a few times the first week I had it and picked up the basic rules.  We played three games.  Although it would be easy to win every game against her, I'll admit I had a lot of fun playing on a not so thoughtful level to give her a better chance.  It is very rewarding just to watch her make decisions about her next bug to put into play and how to move them around.  We even brought the ladybug and mosquito into the last game.  It has ended up being an excellent 1 on 1 bonding tool for me and my kids.  And a perfect starter for teaching them strategy.

OLD
This is a GREAT game.  This game is for everyone who decided to love checkers because chess takes too long and starts off very boring.  My 12 year old daughter can't get enough of it.  She wants a pocket edition to take to school.  It is quick and full of strategy.  We have not tried the ladybug or the mosquito yet.

Love this game. My partner and I take the pocket version whenever we go on holiday or if we're spending a an afternoon in the pub. The bakelite playing pieces feel great in the hand and make a very satisfying noise when you empty them onto the table. We usually play with the three expansion pieces (ladybug, mosquito and pillbug) but the game plays well with or without them. There's plenty of depth and nuance to the strategy. We enjoy it so much that we've just got Hive Carbon for home play (with the larger pieces) and have bought Hive Pocket for several people as a present, all of whom have enjoyed it and others who have seen us play it have gone on to buy it.

Nothing else quite compares for 2 player strategy and portability. We even play it at a table in an in-pool bar, because it doesn't matter if the pieces get wet.

Highly recommended and the most played game in our collection.

It takes a few games between two experienced players before the subtle depths of Hive really surface.  The nature of the rules suggest the first player will have an advantage, but I have yet to notice such an imbalance.

I am coming to realize that I am good at one or two types of games, and nothing else: Tactical Wargames, and hmmm, I guess one type of game...

I bought Hive Pocket for traveling around and sharing. 
I may need a Hive Carbon for my office as a regular fixture. 
A magnetic Hive would be useful. 
I may need to make some custom version of this game for my collection too. I have a few ideas.

One of our favorite games for my wife and I to play at lunchtime. You don't have to set up a board or anything. Just break out the pieces and start playing. The only problem is that we're getting better at it so some of our games are taking a bit longer. Great fun though.

2-player abstract greatness! I believe this would be the perfect game to get a chess player into boardgaming (well, except there's no board, but you know what I mean). I would never turn down a game of Hive.

RATING: 7
Really cool, gorgeous abstract with a theme that actually fits- insects! There's no board. Rather, you construct the "Hive" with your different insects, each of which has a different power to move around the hive. You win once your opponent's queen bee piece is surrounded on all sides. It's such a neat, neat game. If you hate chess, but want to work your brain out in the same way, look no further!

Wonderful, portable, and unusual little abstract!  Great rulebook, so easily taught to unsuspecting passers-by.  ;)
  
I keep this game around because it's a truly portable abstract, chess-like only in that you have an army of pieces with special movement powers.  The boardless aspect is great, so you can play this game just about anywhere you can get your hands on a flat surface.  It plays very quickly too, which is a definite plus for portable games!

Sort of chess-lite. Enjoying so far. Love the clacktastic bakelite pieces.

My most interesting victory yet was my "string out the queen" victory. For some reason my opponent failed to see how to pin my queen from movement either by beetle or by forcing the one hive rule on her. So I just kept moving one step beyond whatever he put next to my queen and his piece together. This had the effect of stringing out my opponents pieces into a line that basically rendered them unplayable due to the one hive rule. It was just a matter of methodically rendering each of his pieces unplayable until I could buy the time to bring in my own pieces for the surround.

This strategy would probably not work on a more savvy opponent.

Its very easy to get this to the table. (for an abstract game). The illustrations get people interested and the gameplay borrows enough from chess to give everyone a good entry point. The game has two problems, which keep it from being great. First the advantage for the starting player is tremendous. Secondly the game is decided within the first 5 to 10 turns, but continues for another 15 to 30. Sure the player, who got the advantage in the first turns, could mess up, but usually he just has to clean up.

Don't just play this once or twice.  And don't think that the beetle is the only piece that can pin the queen bee.  And don't think that the queen bee is the only piece that can be pinned to gain big strategic advantages.

Do think that this is a short but very deep game for it's scope and length.  It's the kind of game where, after one or two plays you might think there's not enough to it, but after 4 or 5 or 12 more plays, you've found a dozen other ways of accomplishing things.

I've got the 3rd edition bakelite version.  So, it's perfect travel/bar game.

I thought I didn't like abstract strategy games any more. I was wrong. This game is the very definition of elegant.It is simple, easy to teach, portable and it only takes 20 minutes to play. I can't think of another game that is so quick and yet has such great depth and replay value. I stopped playing chess some time ago. Thankfully, this game scratches a similar itch and is much easier to get on the table. Hive is one of my top 10 favorite games.

Although it looks easy, Hive is a deep and heavily strategic game resembling an animal kingdom’s Chess: as in Chess indeed you need to constantly ponder every move - yours and your opponent’s - and plan your next turn’s strategy in advance since a careless play is bound to result in a certain defeat.

A modern day classic abstract with simple rules, spot on theme/mechanics, and the most wonderful tactile pieces.

Must have played 100's of games now.  Forms part of the travel game pack - it's small, durable and doesn't take up much space.  Probably exhausted the gameplay (in terms of stategy) and now it's a case of who makes the first (and often only) mistable.

My favorite modern abstract strategy game. Can become all out war between two determined, competitive people. Of all the modern abstracts, I think this one has the most potential to stand the test of time and eventually stand up there with Chess and Go as the timeless staples of the genre.
Despite the intensity it creates between two serious players, Hive also plays well as a light filler when played by two people whose egos and claims to intellectual superiority are not on the line.

Not played yet, but gave the rules a read-through. Found the rules to be awkwardly-written and phrased, and we stopped short of playing because of that. Example, complete with punctuation as-is:

"MOVING (when a piece that has already been introduced (placed) into the game is moved to another position) with the exception of your queen bee not all your pieces have to be placed before you move any."

My head hurt trying to put punctuation where it belonged and ignore the double-nested parenthesis. The instructions thank Jesus Christ for creating all things (I kid you not). One hopes he didn't create these instructions.

Giving it 9 as I would reserve a 10 for Go and Chess in abstract games

A month ago I had never heard of this game

Now I own my own set

Brilliant brilliant game that so far I can see no flaws in so long as one plays the Queen Bees after the 1st and before the 4th moves

The depth to the game is something that builds over time and the nature of the game is for offensive and defensive play to switch pretty fast

A player can thinks they are two steps from Victory

- only to discover they are the same from Defeat!

My only wonder is that this game is not better known outside the 'inner circle' of dedicated Gamers

Though like Alice this one should grow and grow in the years to come....

Note:

If you have no opponent then you can play solitaire by reversing all the pieces bar the Queens and draw them 'blind' for play

- makes for some interesting decisions and adds a bit of an edge to it

3 plays:

An excellent, accessible game in the "pre-chess" vein. Just the right balance of complexity and simplicity to fully support everything from casual play by children to deep tactical study by adults.

The bug theme adds character to the pieces, so their movement rules feel less abstract. It's fun that every game starts out so simply but grows complex in a unique way.

There is a bit of a sense that the game is taxing to play, however; it doesn't quite have the sense of flow that, say, Jaipur has. In some ways I prefer Hey, That's My Fish!, which also balances tactics and simplicity, but which has more surprises along the way. In Hive, you seldom cheer, gasp or groan at a move.

Components are thick and satisfying, and it's a good game for travel (though the unpredictable growth of the board makes it tricky to fit on an airplane tray table).

Very surprised at how much depth this possesses.  I have been playing with various people and continuously winning, despite everybody trying completely different strategies.

Sometimes the game runs as a quick-surround and win game, where everything is offensive and someone wins one move ahead of the other.  This is usually the most boring of games.

Other times the game ends up having a multitude of moves, almost all of the tiles are locked into place, and the few remaining tiles must be manipulated to force your opponents hand into bad, but required, moves.

THis has become one of my two favorite short 2-player games (the other is Pecking Order).  Played against the right opponent, I suspect this game has significant depth.

Keepin for the kids, for its compactness and ability to travel and because it's a great game.

RATING: 5
Simple, easy, with a little depth. We play with the house rule where you can't play your queen first. Makes for a great portable game while traveling as the pieces are made for play practically anywhere and made of bakelite which is a huge plus! Any abstract my wife is willing to/likes to play is good in my book!

*update* This game has grown stale. Its a great quick filler abstract but when desiring a game with more enjoyment with depth this isn't it. At least its not as boring as chess. But its has all the trappings of memorized openings and patterns and forced moves chess has.

Cambiado a Waltien en la BSK por un Warhammer invasión (junto a un Atlanteon y un Pingüinos y Cia), en Octubre de 2010

Habiendo jugado solo una partida, le doy un 6.5. No es suficiente para saber hasta qué punto puede dar de sí el juego. Es un juego abstracto en el que cada jugados dispone de varias fichas de cinco tipos posibles (saltamones, escarabajos, hormigas, abeja y araña). Cada tipo de ficha se mueve de una forma concreta. el objetivo del juego es conseguir rodear a la reina del contrario.  Es bastante abstracto.

I have played Hive more times in a row than any other game (with the possible exception of Magic). Hive is a simple, deep abstract game with a wide variety of strategies available to pursue. My rating is lower than the game deserves; after playing sixty times in a relatively short span of time, all with the same opponent, my play fell into a rut; I'm burned out and having trouble thinking about my moves.

With Hive more than most games, there is an astonishing difference between different people's styles of play. I use grasshoppers a lot; my fianceé loves beetles; Alex likes to freeze and unfreeze pieces. There are a lot of ways to play this game.

RATING: 8
An enjoyable two player game, but I think after a while it might get a bit stale. (I might be wrong...) The fact that they add "extensions" (actually new pieces with different movement) makes it differ quite a lot from chess since your strategies will need to evolve to incorporate them; this might seem like it's going to make the game live on, but IMO it might end up cluttering it so much as to make it unplayable if there are an unreasonably high number of types of pieces.

Un juego con el que tengo sensaciones encontradas, me gusta jugarlo pero se me da mal. Me pasa algo parecido con el ajedrez, que muchas veces no le presto toda la atención que debería y me autosuicido. Además creo que voy empeorando con el tiempo (o mis rivales mejorando). El juego bonito y muy transportable. Es la versión POCKET y siempre la he jugado con las expansiones (Mosquito y Mariquita) que dan mucho juego (imprescindibles diría yo). 15 minutos por partidas y ganas de repetir después de cada una. Creo que el jugador inicial tiene ventaja.

I bought this game hoping it would be a good two player game to play with my girlfriend. After a few plays I find the game somewhat dull. I easily beat her with little effort and most games seem to follow the same pattern. Even when I try to vary my moves for interests sakes, the games still seem too similar. In many other games she has much more of a chance of beating me and it is still satisfying when I win too. I think against two equally skilled players this game could be more fun. I played two games against a friend which were interesting, but as a game to play with my girlfriend it fell far short.

Chess evolved. A perfect abstract strategy game where you use different types of bugs that each have their own movement mechanics to surround your opponent's queen. The pieces are made out of a domino-like material and are extremely satisfying to play with.

Hive deserves the highest praise for its exemplary and compelling theme-mechanics matchup. Also the minimalistic elegance (no board) is a hallmark of originality. 

I believe both Chess players and those wary of the King's game can enjoy this design. A very fine tactical game.

My personal desire to play Hive however probably doesn't quite match my high esteem for this design since filler-type games fail to excite me as much as heavy eurogames or wargames. The BGG rating guidelines thus make rating decisions quite difficult. Anyway, 8 seems quite appropriate.

Update: A 6 more aptly describes me feeling about this game after repeated play. Just doesn't have the repeat draw for a rating of mine beyond that.

A great game while the novelty lasts. Once it wears off, you're left with a deeply tactical, chess-like game with lots of paralyzing decisions to make. It's hard to get people to play this one-- it's heavy on strategy and light on fun.

A guy at work found out I am a gamer and kept asking to take breaks to teach me Hive. He did and I loved it. I had him sweating during the second game, purely by accident and I didn't follow through properly. Then in the third game I actually put him under enough pressure to win. I was very impressed with myself. He assures he didn't let me win I went out and bought the pocket version right away. Phenomenal. A quickie that plays this well is well worth having in your game bag.

Well I'm not sure how deep it is. Time will tell, but I really love this game. It's beautiful, portable, and chess-like in just the right ways, but the placement mechanic lends it entirely different feel. I'd play this all day long if I could. But how does it hold up to intensive study and play?

RATING: 7
This was a hard game for me to get into initially as I'm not a visual thinker. I really enjoy abstract strategy games, but I tend to favor those where pieces either don't move at all or all move in the same way as it's easier for me to "see" the moves better that way. Hive is more like chess, where each piece moves in a unique way.

But I have to say struggling through my first couple of games paid off and I ended up thoroughly enjoying it. My only complaint now is that when you play a bunch against the same opponent you fairly quickly reach a point where many games end in a stalemate.

Update: "Upgraded" to the Pocket edition as it was basically the same price as buying the two expansion pieces and I like the size better.

Great abstract filler game for 2! It's very fast so you can always take a couple of games, and it's extremely sturdy so you can play it on any surface, even on the beach. It's of course highly interactive and the idea that the different bugs move in different pattern is nice (though, of course the game would suck if they all moved in the same way!). Got the carbon edition - it's nicer looking and includes the ladybug (great addition) and mosquito (decent addition).

Cerebral and chess-like. This game is well thought out. I have played about 20 times and I have still not figured out a good strategy. I feel like it's something that I may be thinking about and playing for a long while. The rules are a little difficult to explain to new gamers though... I suggest you find someone who doesn't mind having different pieces with all different movement rules.

It's also fun because, even though I used to be decent at chess (at least, in my friend+family circle), my kids seem to destroy me at Hive.

(2/2/10 - 21 Plays) Not as in love as I was. Tactical richness, but I don't feel the combinatorial beauty of chess. Not by a long shot.

Old comments: This sounded like a great game for my wife and me, but the new rule in the house is "Thou shalt not buy games before trying them." So I tried it the other day. The richness of the strategy and tactics that develop from the movement rules is staggering. So simple, yet so deep. Reminds me of chess, but much more approachable. So, I bought it. Now, let's see what the wife thinks. Since I'm likely to play this a lot, no need to give it a first-impression rating. If I were to, though, it would be an eight with a great likelihood of increasing.

The heavy wood was nice, but the poor production quality for the stickers (uneven placement and scarring) wasn't attractive given the cost.  Solid little game design, tho I've doubts on long term replayability.

Update: Now own the plastic and the wood editions and have been playing more frequently.  Long replayability has proven better than expected.  The curve seems to be for early games to be blowouts, then a long series of protracted seeming endless deadlocks, then highly volatile games (short, long, unpredictable) with no deadlocks.

RATING: 7.5
Dry for me as I'm not really an abstract gamer, but Hive is solid. I'm not crazy about the default rules regarding the ants, though. But this game is solid with some variants.
   
We sometimes play where you have to have all tiles upside down. If you wantto play a new piece, you have to pick one at random and turn it right-side up to see what it is. 
This adds some randomness of course, but it takes the weight off of the players to 'play perfectly' and prevents a stale meta from developing. We prefer tactics to strategy in our games, so this simple variant makes the game much more enjoyable for us.


Ants made the game a little simple (they're very powerful, and using other units become less fun/interesting as a result), so we changed their mechanic so they can go around the board like usual, but they can only stop when they hit another ant (either team's ant). This makes the game much more interesting right there, and they become a fun yet still powerful unit, with interesting set-up and combo potential.

Mixed feelings as I typically love abstracts. Hive has interesting decisions, a perfect playtime, is easy to learn and play, and portable, and yet, there is just something missing that keeps it from being above a 7. I think its that the meat of the game occurs in a handful of plays in the middle game, and thus the tension and decisions are confined to a just few turns.

play it twice for the first time today, good game, those bakelite tiles really are to die for. Very thick and hefty, The game itself is somewhat unique in that there really isn't a board, just a few rules that keep all of the insects in one big mass. The only downside for me is that it doesn't come in a kosmos two player box, which means if I bought it it wouldn't get played as often as it should (it is a thing I have, it is much easier to say pick one of the square box games than to say pick a 2 player game, since then you have to figure out if you want a 2-2 player or if a 2+ player really works for 2 and everything, too much hassle)

Ok, I've done it. I finally gave a game a '10'. This is it.

EVERY time I play, I want to play again - without exception. It is elegant, smooth, and refined. There are other games I enjoy as much as this one, but this one scratches all the right parts when it comes to depth, accessibility, strategy, tactics and time spent.

Why is this better than Chess? I like that it is not as formal as chess. There is no board - it can be played anywhere. I like that it plays faster than chess (ok - not really - I lose at Chess really fast). 

Also, for an abstract, all of the pieces make thematic sense - their movement is intuitive and can be easily explained and remembered.

RATING: 5
When I first read about this game. I just had to get it. The idea of using insects to battle each other is an awesome one. I had visions of Wasps battling Bees and many other insects. When I opened the box I was very disappointed to find only 5 types of insects per side. The insects don't really battle each other either. They just manuever in different ways. After some further plays I find that the game might be heavily biased to the first player. I could be wrong here but moving your ant around behind the opponents queen and then proceeding to add pieces and surround the queen seems to be very hard to stop.

I just got this in trade (San Juan) and I am really impressed by the glossy, sturdy, bright small box the game comes in.  The instructions look very well-designed as well, colorful and compact.  I thought the stickers would be weak at best, but they are quite thick, some sort of plastic material, and the backgrounds almost look reflective.  The artwork is colorful, and the overall feeling I get from the game is that somebody really cared about the way it was presented and did more than they really had to in order to get the best effect possible.  Hive feels like an heirloom game to me, so I'm going to varnish the visible wood at some point.  My kids are drawn to the pieces and like to pick them up and play with them as well.  I'm not disappointed in the slightest with the quality of this edition, although the bakelite is still tempting, even more so now that I've played the game (online).  I've had Zertz, and the impact of the pieces and theme, as well as having more of a feeling of control while playing, makes this more attractive in my opinion.

The game play is still delightful after about 15 plays (some of those online).  Unexpected things happen, I manage to lose in unique and stunning ways, and occasionally my dung beetles trudge over to the enemy queen and squat right on her.  Better than Zertz, better than Shear Panic.

This went unplayed for a while.  Like 5 months.  Daughter suggested it today.  Now we can't get enough!  I never really enjoyed playing chess.  This game has a similar feel, but is much more fun.  Partly because of the theme, but mostly because there is no board and your pieces are toe-to-toe right from the start.

Kids like this game win or lose.  So do players who enjoy simple abstract strategy.  Most other players (eurogame fans, wargamers) will hate this game, and for good reason.  I find that the game is most enjoyable with certain players but not others for this reason.  It is a very short game, lending itself to round after round play (best 2 of 3, or 3 of 5).  I finally was beat by my niece of 9 yrs. old, who chose a mirror strategy, copying my every move.  When this happens, its is the player who plays their queen bee last who will probably lose.  This game is not as brilliant as it is purported to be, and is certainly not the "new chess".

I find Hive to be a curious title. One would be inclined to say that there cannot be much 'game' in two sets of 11 pieces with insects depicted on them. And after about 15 games, there remains a tiny nagging little voice in my head which does not succeed in making itself heard.

Hive is pleasantly simple enough, plays in a very short amount of time, and it sure isn't easy to win against a determined opponent... Subtle strategies started appearing the more and more I played against my main gaming partner. She dislikes hard thought and insects, but this combination actually meets her approval. Simple things like blocking dangerous pieces by attaching a lonely piece to them to they'd be held down by the 'no splitting the hive'-rule. The Beetle began to show its significant power more readily, and now forms a fixed ingredient in any of our games. Creating bypasses to free up much-needed tied-down pieces is an important tactic. Trying to separate the enemy Bee from her subjects so she makes for an easier target: present and accounted for. And so forth. The fact that you're learning the ropes of the game this way indicates to me that I'm dealing with a good game, namely one which allows you discover tricks on your own.

I think my main complaint is that to date I haven't been able to actually force a certain strategy to be succesful. Then again, Hive may not actually allow that, as the playing area can go in any direction when there's still a small number of stones on the table. But how and when you should add new stones remains a bit of a mystery to me. The balance between using specialty movements and bringing in fresh insects is a subtle one, highly dependent on what is already in play, and where. I'm hoping that more plays will help me (us) hone that talent so that I have a bit more sense of purpose than I have now. I'm not expecting this, really, but at the same time, when I look at how my tactics sense developed... This is not a game you should diss immediately after playing. And completely unrelated, its portability makes me wish for other games which were as durable.

Amazing game.  Has a bit of a "constricted" feel, and it's a bit too easy to get into a drawish situation where someone's pieces are all pinned down but their opponent is unable to deliver the final blow.  Still, it's a fascinating game that people will likely still be playing twenty years from now.

I'm not very good at this game, but I like some of the game play.  Wish I knew how to get my queen free more.  Seems like she starts to go down about turn 5 or 6 despite my best efforts.

I love Hive. I love that my kids love Hive. I love that they play by themselves, against each other. I love that we have the ladybug, but haven't felt the need to take it out of its package.

This feels like the perfect step between checkers and chess. An interesting abstract that introduces different abilities for different pieces, and requires the first glimpse of if-I-go-here-then-he-goes-there-I-can-go-there...

I've spent quite a few evenings trying to hammer home the concept of checkmate and unavoidable mates-in-2 to my kids. But Hive somehow managed for them to discover this idea on their own.

I had my eye on this for a while and lost a bit of interest after playing it online and finding it a bit uninteresting.  Then I bought it when it was on sale and I needed a smallish game in order to get free shipping.

It's an amazing little game.  I'm surprised at how much fun it packs into so little time.

If I'm in the mood for a larger and longer term brain burn I'll probably reach for Go, but whenever I don't have the time or severe mental readiness I need for Go I will definitely be reaching for this.

Love the components.  Great game play - and obviously deep.  Just have to find the time to play it often enough to figure it out now.  Not wild about the idea of 'expansions' though... chess doesn't have expansions.  Makes it seem like there is something wrong with the base game, which I don't think is the case.

My favourite abstract logic game. The only one which I can consider myself good at. That's probably because it's strategy is very small-scale compared to Go or Chess.

This game, for those who love shorter, less thematic games, is GREAT! It is a sweet, elegant design, that is quick to learn with some thoughtful strategy to it. The pieces are high quality, and the regular version makes a great travel version (so skip buying the travel version). You can play it with a wide range of ages. 

However, I'm not a fan of 2 player, shorter games for the most part. and so, like most of those games its rating from me is lower than it would be for other players I'm sure.

A tactical game.

The differing pieces' movements remind me of chess, but they differ more greatly - the beetle and grasshopper specially having no analogues and taking some time to fully understand the capabilities of.

Thanks to the restrictions on movement or placement and the lack of starting pieces, analysis paralysis has never been a problem for me and I don't expect it to be.

Games only take a few minutes but still feel like a full experience.

I'm strongly considering buying this. I'll probably do so if I still enjoy it after the boardspace tournament.

2008-04-20 
(23 recorded plays - probably about 27 plays)

On Saturday, I played an overly long game that seemed to threaten to end in a stalemate. Though never repeating a 'loop' of actions, our pieces danced back and forth, with the meaning behind each move constantly diminishing until I won thanks to my opponent's mistake. 

I was worried that stalemates would be a real possibility and that play would be very repetitive, but having played a long game against thw 5th best boardspace player and losing, despite realising afterwards that I had at least two opportunities to win, gives me hope for the reverse.

The greatly variable playtime is an interesting factor. I think I prefer the more definite ending of other games - like Go, which will see roughly the same number of moves played on the same size of board.

Of course, Go is never as short as the shortest games of Hive...

8->8.24789

2009-04-21
35 plays

Another two supremely long games today.

I think I enjoyed the game more when it was over within around 10 minutes rather than taking over half an hour.

Towards the end, there was a long period when I felt little progression in the game. There was some change and my opponent did outplay me to snatch a win out of the jaws of a draw but getting there felt so slooow with little appreciable change in the gamestate.

Again, I'm reminded how much I enjoy the clear progression in Go.

I enjoyed this game when I was first getting to grips with it - it felt like a full experience could be had wihin a few minutes.

Now, I think I've reached a higher level and games I lose seem to drag on. 

I guess you could consider Hive to have a quick setup phase (lasting until both queens are deployed), a quick beginning phase (lasting until both queens are pinned), the mid-phase (as the insects are deployed) then the possibility of a long end-game (as the pieces dance around). Beginner games seem to be won before the midphase ends, whilst the end-game requires new strategies, more foresight and can last far longer than the rest of the game put together.

In this way, Hive mutates from a quick thing into a more drawn-out affair.

This is a lighter abstract game.  It is a bit more forgiving than some others I like, and even when losing you never feel like you are getting crushed.  This makes it somewhat psychologically better than some other abstracts such as Chess and Zertz when played with players of differing skill levels.

Hive is a great two player game that is quick, easy to teach, but is very strategic. I just recently picked up this game, and I can already tell that it will be one that I bring with me on every trip because you could literally play this game almost anywhere. The pieces are sturdy and durable, and will not be ruined if you accidentally spill something on them. This is a game for anyone who likes games with little to no luck that you can play over and over again trying to hone your skill and strategy! High recommendation for me, and one that I plan to play for many years to come.

After probably a dozen plays I'm starting to see better strategies emerging and what seemed like a fairly simple game has a bit more to it than I'd originally thought.  For example, you can really mess up your opponents plans by moving your Queen Bee out of the way when they're trying to surround it, which can lead to your opponent calling you mean names! :)

Great game. The biggest advantages, to my mind, are game length and portability. You can play in 10 minutes or less, depending on the players, and you can play on nearly any reasonably fast surface.

- Gameplay and replayability: 4/4. Great strategy game without the risk of your head exploding; call it Chess-light.

- Luck factor: 4/4. There is no luck involved at all.

- Duration: 4/4. One game takes only 15 minutes, so you can play as long as you like.

- Player range: 2/4. Supports only 2 players.

- Theme and looks: 2/4. Although this is an abstract game, the insects map amazingly well onto their style of movement.

- Set up/clean up time: 4/4. Both can be done in less than a minute.

- Learning curve and documentation: 4/4. The rules can be explained in less than 5 minutes, and are so easy they don't need a lot of documentation. The manual is very clear, with helpful graphics showing the allowed movements and border cases.

- Durability: 4/4. I'm sure that my Hive set will outlast several generations after me. It would need a hammer and brute force to break.

- Portability: 4/4. The standard edition of Hive is not well suited for traveling because the blocks are really heavy. My carbon edition weighs 550g, and even 650g with the ladybug and the mosquito included! In comparison: Blokus To Go weighs only 320g. Thus, when you'll have to carry it on your back a lot, you'll think twice before packing it. I think this is a pity, because Hive has the potential of being the perfect travel game. However, apparently there now exists "Hive Pocket", which will most likely fix this issue. 

- Summary: Hive is fun and strategic and at the same time quick and easy on the brain. And as if that weren't enough, you can even take it with you on a trip.

This game is excellent (with all three expansions or base, just LB/M makes the advantage of going first too strong). Requiring no board and pretty minimal space overall is great and provides it with a huge advantage compared to most other abstracts. The gameplay is solid, relatively quick-paced, and enjoyable while remaining challenging. Low emphasis on memorization (things such as opening sequences) allows for tactical play at all stages of the game.

A chess like game from designer John Yianni, played without a board with hex tiles. Each piece has different powers of movement, and the goal is to encircle the "queen" piece. Unfortunately, it seems to "suffer" some of the drawbacks that come with chess. First player has what can only be described as a huge advantage. Seems drawish at high levels. With a large following, Hive is proven to be a great game regardless. Inspiring much study from a few talented individuals, Hive now has a strategy book from Randy Ingersoll!

Since I dont own this game i havent been able to play it against another human being. The only way I can play it is against an AI at www.hivemania.com. Since I win nearly all the time against the AI Im still wonderin if the AI is that bad or if the starting player has an advantage.

Edit 1: I had the chance to get a cheap copy of it. Now I have to see how good it is with a human opponent. I still beat the AI in nine out of ten games. I really hope there's no start-player advantage since I really like the mechanics of the game.

Edit 2: After playing against a human opponent I can't really see a starting-player-advantage that can't be overcome. The AI is just not really good. So as a result my rating goes two up to an eight.

RATING: 8
About six plays and maybe 35 online plays (vs. computer).

So far I'm not sure that there are a lot of varying strategies. Play your spiders first, then an ant, then your queen, then peg your opponent's queen to a spot and any key pieces (like ants) if your opponent has made an error.

Put a beetle on top of your opponent's queen and play pieces right around it. (Online game has a tough time dealing with this one).

It is a very fun game. But after three face to face plays, that's usually enough for awhile.

RATING: 5
This is a great game when you either don't have a lot of time, or players.  It plays very quickly, so you have time for multiple plays.  It's the perfect game for lunch hour gaming.  And I love the tactile feel of the heavy bakelite tiles.  

As an added bonus, it comes with it's own logo imprinted zippered nylon carrying case, which is very cool.   Now, I've got to get the Mosquito expansion.

I traded this away, and probably shouldn't have, but since my wife didn't care for it, I couldn't think of a good reason to keep it.

One of the best abstract two player games. It has everything a great abstract should have: simple rules, short setup and depth in spades. And in a sort of quirky way it almost feels like insects are actually hoping around the place.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I like that Hive does not have a board, making it very portable, but it was not my cup of tea.  I like my abstracts to be very clean and simple.  So while I'm sure Hive has a nice balance to it, I've only played it 4 times, and I don't have the inclination to play it again.  The way the pieces move is still not intuitive to me.

(... but there is an iPhone app, so there is a good chance that I'll get past the curve with quick single player games while in the jon.)

RATING: 9
This one is nice. I own the pocket version, which I keep taking with me, in order to pounce it on anyone I can get to play it with me. Lots of strategic depth in a very small game. Solid material as well (even the rules fit in the bag and are printed on somewhat stiffer paper than normal -- so far, they have survived in my backpack, which *really* says something).

Update: I rated this up from 7.5 or so. This one really grows on you. It's so much fun to explore it, and what with the carefully designed expansions, which seem to be finely balanced, there will be lots more to explore. Btw: I hardly ever play a single game of Hive, instead, we always end up playing it in series of at least 3 games.

RATING: 8
Hive is an interesting and beautiful game. I'm normally not that fond of abstract games but this one got me.

Each player has 11 hexagonal blocks with different insect on them (same setup for both players). One bee, two ants, two beetles, three grasshoppers and three spiders I think. The insects have different movement characteristics, the grasshopper jumps, the beetle crawls over things and can lock blocks and so on. A turn consist of either playing one of your blocks next to another of your blocks and not bordering an enemy block or moving an already placed block. You can't move blocks that leave insects cut off from the Hive, so if you have a chain of blocks you can "lock" a block by moving another block outside it and prolonging the chain of blocks for example. You win the game if the enemy bee is totally surrounded by blocks, not necessarily your blocks, any block is ok.

The game plays fast but you still need to think ahead, adapt to what the other players does and try not to get your blocks locked up. Really good!

RATING: 7
Players take turns to place or move hexagonal bug pieces onto a table (or as the game declares - "any flat surface").  There are several different bugs, each with different movement abilities.  The object is to jink your insects around to trap and surround your opponents queen bee.  Think free-form hexagonal chess.  Works very well.  BAKELITE - the new edition looks very nice - large clunky tiles with an indented coloured bug.  It does come in a larger box, along with a zip up carry bag.

Very, very nice abstract. The theme could be different and the game would remain the same, but at least the different insects reflect well the movement mechanics that they have.
Plays quickly, is taught quickly as well.
Will definitively pick it up and play tons. 
Note: the material (similar to a nice set of dominoes) is such that it invites itself to living in your bag (at least when you're on vacation).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid game. I'm not normally as big of a fan of abstracts but this one is pretty fun.  Has the unique unit movements of chess without the heavy investment in studying opening moves etc.  The only problem I noticed was that you can sometimes end up in a position where you can keep stalling for a long time but can never find a way to regain enough tempo to win.

I've played a series of this with Juvie and another series with my Mom and it seems simple at first, but as you get into more plays, you start to see many more possibilities.

For example, after my Mom and I played today, I thought about the game and realized that she could have made some additional moves when we originally thought she was pinned (specifically, she could have used her Ants to pin new tiles I was playing thus preventing me from moving the new insects to surround her queen).

Like chess, this one makes you think a lot.

Very cool abstract with fresh and yet fitting theme. Insects and arachnids crawling all over the place in order to protect the own bee queen and meanwhile suffocating the enemy queen. The mechanism of immobilizing leads to a play style of mutual crippling attacks to gain the critical advantage.

Really like the fact that you need no board. You can literally play on any more or less flat surface.

THE BAKE-LITE VERSION!

Even if you're not a fan of abstract games, this game is a blast!  you'll mull over this game as it was chess, for each different kind of bug as a specific move pattern.  a big plus is its transportability, as it is in an extremely small but sturdy box.  as the pieces are heavy wood and there is no board required, i've played this game on the beach!  its a beauty to look at; this fact alone attracts player's interest.  game instruction takes about 5 minutes.  hey, the pieces even come with their sickers already stuck on 1st edition).  I like the new polymer tiles and tile bag.  way to go, gen-four-two!  a must-own!

Hive is either on my person or in my desk at work. I love breaking it out for a new person, especially when they confess themselves to be a fan of chess. Such an excellent 2-player abstract, with key moments defined by the rules of the game (in particular the Hive rule - when you opponent realizes they can't make that particular game-winning move because it would break the Hive, so satisfying.)

Expansion pieces are great: mosquito is by far my favorite for the amount of unexpected strategy it brings.

Fast and fun but it seems quite deep as well.

This little ultra portable gem dares to be compared to Chess, and while it is not a classic yet, it is every bit as deep and mind numbing as any strategy game I know.

Clever mechanics, undeniably cool pieces, but this abstract game isn't really my cup o' tea. It is a bit chesslike in that each piece has it's own particular way of moving. Unfortunately, I'm not much of a chess fan. Still, I plan on keeping this one and revisiting it from time to time when in the right mood. It plays rather quickly, which is a plus.

BoardSpace AI is much inferior to a human player, to the point where playing it may have been a hindrance in playing a human, not a help.

I enjoy how the weak pieces in this are all weak in interesting ways, and how none of them are simply lesser versions of another piece. It forces players to think about how to use weak pieces effectively much sooner than in many other abstracts and provides for more interesting tactics than most games with identical pieces.

Also, the bits are fantastic, at least in the resin edition. I haven't seen the wood ones.

A constant challenge between two experienced players, all it takes is one slip up for the win. The mosquito and ladybug are nifty add-ons, but the pillbug is a game changer. It's been some time since I played with the base game alone, as having the extra pieces really enhances both the game play and theme. Playing this one on the table is essential, as the bakelite pieces really feel good in the hand and have that comforting 'clack' when played.

RATING: 4
This is a quick little abstract that is easy to learn, play, and take with you wherever you go.  I think I had the game built up to be more than it actually is, in that I find the games to be over before they get started and there is too little going on compared to other abstracts.  I dislike that things are often determined within one round of each other which means going first is a huge advantage.  There are other 2 player games I would rather play but this by no means a bad game, just one that I'm not particularly fussy on.

Did not particularly care for this one. It's not awful and I don't mind to play it occasionally, but it's just a bit flat for me. Not fun.

RATING: 7
A bit difficult to understand at first, but after a couple of plays it becomes clearer. 

Evolving board, not being able to eat opponent and tricks that you can do with different pieces combine into a nice little game. This is a very good filler for two people.

It's still very early days, but I genuinely like this game. 

The bakelite pieces are pleasing from a tactile standpoint. They'll likely take a beating, so they might be perfect for camping.

Strategically but manageably complex. When do I add pieces? What pieces do I add now, later? Where? Or should I move?

Fast! Once you know what you're about. 

Though I have alluded to it's complexity, it remains a very simple game.

The german rules are very confusing. I had to use the english rules to understand the game. For example the german rule says "to win the game make the bee immobile" instead of "surround the bee completely". To make the bee immobile it is enough to surround the bee with 3 insects, because the bee can't be moved, if it moves another tile. Furthermore the german rules say "move a tile" instead of "move a tile sliding".

RATING: 3
The theme is unusual, but plays an integral role in the game's overall construct. The '1 Hive' rule lays the foundation for what is a mechanical sound game. However, this game is super abstract and for whatever reason I have failed to truly grasp it. Defeat or victory become obvious a few turns before the end, but I find it very difficult to turn the tide.

How did this happen? An abstract that makes me think, but which I have no real advantage over people that don't do well at abstracts. I might just be lucky, but I think it's because even though the strategy can be discussed and approached in different ways, the tactics are quite obvious after a few plays.

Cool movement scheme and great components. The non-modular board lets it escape the monotony other abstract strategies suffer. 

A game with truly no set up. 

What keeps it from going higher than 5? This game can have a somewhat tedious midgame that makes it go a couple turns too long. 

I'm still having trouble seeing a defensive strategy in this game. Hopefully this will clear up with more plays.

(As of [b]20+[/b] plays) This perfectly fulfills my nascent two-player abstract strategy needs. The rules are easy to learn and easy to teach, and it plays relatively quickly. The strategy is varied enough to keep things fresh after several back-to-back plays, but not so obtuse as to make new players feel totally overwhelmed. I have successfully introduced this to people of various ages and gaming backgrounds.

[b]Why this is in my Top Ten:[/b] Hive provides the perfect casual two-player abstract strategy experience for those of us not willing to devote years to mastering the intricacies of Chess. It's [i]gorgeous[/i], which means it attracts positive attention both on the shelf and while being played, while its simple rules provide enough strategic depth while simultaneously allowing new players to genuinely compete with more experienced opponents.

A neat game which can be played on a very small table. It suffers a bit from 1st player symptom where the one going first has enough of an advantage that the 1st player is usually "loosing the game", rather than 2nd player winning the game. So whenever you start you bound to win more - at least in my experience.

Played 2 games, won 1, lost 1. I enjoyed this game, abstract but with a fitting theme that works. I soon accepted the way each insect moved, and picturing this helped me consider how to use them. Losing the second match makes me want to try this again and the rules are refreshingly simple. *** Got my own copies and played a lot since, mostly introducing it to people. I win the first match, they learn very quickly and I usually struggle to win the second match. It's abstract but doesn't feel it. I connect to it much easier than to a game like chess. If you are a gamer, this must be in your collection. My rating goes up to 8.

Decent abstract, can be boring though.  I can't play it too many times in a row or I get sick of it.  I wouldn't mind playing every once in a while.  I think I like the "idea" of it being a nice little portable game, more then the actual execution and gameplay.  Also, the stickers on the wood seem cheap.  I would much prefer one of the homemade woodburned versions or the newer bakelite edition, but it's too expensive for what I consider to be a highly overrated game.

The tiles are pretty and 'thematic' enough to aid in teaching the game. The rules are simple and few in number. Games are relatively fast. So far every game has felt different, with good tension, a tangible back and forth and the occasional move that, obviously unexpected by one side or the other, makes or ruins your strategy up until then. And then there have been the brilliant recoveries... So, so far so great.

Nowadays, I much prefer mitigable-risk games, such as Netrunner and RftG, but Hive has the timeless quality of Chess, which I played a lot in my youth, and it brings back the old pleasures of one-on-one perfect-information abstract games. (Although Hive is not abstract at all in my view.) It has a very peculiar crescendo of tension, because pieces are only added to the battle, never taken from it, something reminiscent of Go. What is unique to Hive is that the pieces ARE the board and so the topology of the game has a fluidity that no other game in the same genre presents. It is also a very sneaky game: I lost count of the positions where I was sure the game was over but the underdog discovered an escape route and turned the game around (always keep a grasshopper next to your queen). I believe people will be playing some version of Hive two hundred years from now.

A lot more fun than expected.  I'm not a big fan of abstract games, but I really enjoy Hive.  I particularly don't enjoy Chess, but Hive somehow avoids most of the problems that I have with that game while sharing a similar style.  It doesn't have the depth of Chess, which probably makes me like it better, but it's definitely interesting and complex.  The pieces are very high quality, which made me bump it up a half point.

RATING: 7.3
I consider this a chess varient without the confines of a board.

Just for 2.  Clever & adicting.  Starting with the first piece, you create a game board that grows, never shrinks, and changes shape with each move, even after it has reached its maximum size. Like chess, different pieces with unique moves, and the first player has the advantage.  So the winner should be best of "x" number of games.

I was going to give the game a 7 due to the repetitive game ending scenarios I had seen during our last games.  However the rules clarification provided by whywai (thank you BTW), I now see that the game is probably much better this way.
My impression is that eventually playing styles will become a sort of metagaming in itself as not all the bugs are created equal; the beetle is vastly superior to the lowly spider;  the grasshopper can be very strong in the right context but ultimately the ant is really the one critter to look out for.  Yes, you win by surrounding the queen, but first bottling the ants is almost necessary before you can even think of nailing her down.  Excellent game.  Quick note on the pieces: they're lovely and neat but the finish could be improved so as to not stain so easily.

RATING: 10
For the purpose of disclosure, I own the carbon edition of the game, which includes the ladybug and mosquito. This game is the replacement for chess for me since it is much more accessible game. I love the quality of the tiles in the game and the fact that this game does not require a board at all and can be played on any surface. Fairly easy to learn and has enough depth for most people. No luck or randomness in this game and if you are looking for an abstract game, I highly recommend this game as no other games in this category come close to the tight design of this game. The only complaint of this game is that the pouch or bag that comes with it is not the best and makes the game feel a bit cheap. I would prefer something like a dice pouch. Some complained that this game can end up in a tie often but I have not played/mastered this game enough to run into that issue. If you have this issue you can play the "tournament rules" which should address some of this issue but I am not 100% sure.

Many have described this as the 21st century chess. It is similar in that it is an abstract, therefore quick to learn and with lots of strategy. It does have the three strategic elements of time, space and material.  The material aspect isn't as strong, and the space element is unique due to the lack of a board. I would disagree that it has the same depth as chess, but it makes up for it in accessability.

RATING: 8
Another excellent game.  Like a mixture of Dominos, Checkers, and Chess, but better than all of those.  Like Dominos, you can play it anywhere you have a playing surface (even on a picnic blanket, if the ground beneath it is flat enough).  It's fun balancing between protecting your own queen bee and going after your opponent's queen bee.  Having the mosquito piece definitely does make a big difference in play, but so far the ladybug piece hasn't had much of a chance to show its potential.  Finally played another game of this with Mr. Billington today (10-22-2011).  Ladybug piece is much more useful than we thought it was the last time, but overall, I think he and I are too evenly matched (mainly because I learn more from him than he seems to learn from me).

A luck-less, "board-less board game". Has a shallow theme of sorts, but it's basically an abstract. Someone described this as "Chess-like, but not a Chess variant". That's pretty accurate, but it fails to capture this game's uniqueness.

Hive has become an addiction of sorts. I even purchased "Play Hive Like a Champion".

I am never good at abstract strategy games where different peices have different movements.  Chess almost turned me off games FOREVER as a kid.  Hive plays a lot faster, the bits are more fun to handle, it's more portable and teachable, and is way more satisfying.  Even though I usually lose.

Hive has a very simple rule set you can explain in a couple of minutes but they are enough for a very nuanced game.

Quick enough that you will always be wanting another go.

Hive often gets compared to Chess and there are a few obvious similarities like the different movement characteristics of the playing pieces. I guess it probably stimulates pretty much the same brain areas, too. However, the game doesn't really play similarly at all. That's partly because the game is very short and partly because of the variable playing field that makes for a much more dynamic experience.

Having played this a decent amount of times in the last year I can vouch for it confidently. It's fast, but deep and every play is different. I find it also more engaging, than most other abstracts.
From the expansions I only use the ladybug. That one is pretty cool, although the game is fine without it. I do not really care about the other expansions though, as it feels as if they would only make it more complicating without adding new colour to the game.
Anyway, it's cheap, elegant and engaging. Probably my favourite two-player game.

Quite an interesting game which under the right circumstances I think I could really get into, however, I am more group board game focused at the moment, nor really know someone to share this game long term at lunchtime, as I think it would start to really shine as you come to understand the subtleties. The bakelite pieces are very nice to touch / feel, so overall It's still a thumbs-up for future opportunities (14/12/08) UPDATE: I have really tried to like this game, and yet something is missing.  Even managed to try it at work as an Ongoing game. It's very much a two player game where I feel the player going first really has to make a bad mistake  to lose. Alternately, being the second player you feel as if It's always catch-up footy.  Finally, as I don't have the mosquito piece expansion, I now sense I am playing an earlier obsolete version of the game.  Still, the Bakelite pieces are so nice, that I'm not ready to archive the game (rating  down from 7 to 5) (1/12/11).  UPDATE: Havent played for a while, but the concept is becoming more appealing (Rating 5.837, Dec 16)

A simple design that requires some deep thinking.  I think it's pretty easy early on to see where you've screwed up, and at a certain point, you start to panic, knowing all you can do is react to your opponent's attacks rather than going on the offensive yourself.  Very important, I think, to get all your pieces out early.

How the hell do you get out of jams in this game if your opponent is one step ahead of you in surrounding the queen?

Teaching my grade two students how to play this game.  I think it will be great for their spatial sense.

The "beetle-on-top-of-queen" is a mighty powerful one...almost too powerful.  Does it ruin the flow of the game?  I'm not sure yet.

Although it is an abstract strategy game, which I am not predisposed to like, but unlike say chess, there is not way too much analysis. You can look ahead to the next moves, but you don't have to look 20 moves out.

Short and sweet game. Love the pieces, every game is different, it's portable, no set-up, rich in strategy. It is quite similar to chess but lighter and fresher. Always down for a quick game or two of hive. Make sure to get the version with the mosquito and ladybug.





UPDATE JULY 2013: Well after playing it over a year or so it's earned a permanent spot in my collection. It really is a great game and a lot of fun but there's a small annoyance. There's no way to challenge other pieces in this game. If there were a way to take pieces off of the board in the game or challenge other pieces to move it would open up a plethora of new strategies and much more depth. I've read about changing the Spider(most useless piece) to have the ability to either eat another bug and take it off the board or trade places with a bug. Sounds like a good idea in theory, I've still yet to try it out.

A cleverly conceived game that eventually wore out its welcome.  After numerous plays there didn't appear to be any way for the 2nd player to "break serve."  That is to say, the first player has a tempo advantage that the game does not seem to provide an antidote for.

RATING: 6.75
This is a quick playing and fun little tile laying game and the tiles are made really well, being heavy and visually appealing.

Game play is quick and very easy to teach/learn. Players are trying to maneuver their pieces around the others, in order to try and surround and trap their opponents Queen. Each of the different insects has a special ability, which allows it to move in a special way.

This is a really nice 2 player game and everyone seems to enjoy it. Kids, family members and gamers alike.

Dull game with zero luck involved and a poor theme.  I managed to win, "randomly", but only because neither me nor my other intelligent opponent thought more than 3 moves ahead.  Would be an OK game if you could restrict people's thought to 2-3 moves ahead, but as it is, it's unfairly balanced toward serious "thinkers".  Games like that suck.

An incredibly clever two-player strategy-game. Simple rules and mechanics really work and leave lots of room for creative tactics.

Good game to play in a bar! You can have a quick slurp while your opponent tries to figure out the sneaky move you have just played. Short enough to allow for a rematch straight away, too. However, against a good player with experience, expect it to be much more chess-like in strategy and duration!

This one surprised me. So many new abstracts come along and prove to be shallow and weak, this one is an exception. Games are usually over in 10-20 minutes, which is a plus as well.

A great game to travel with.  I have the Carbon edition, so it has the extra pieces, which I almost never play with.

Part of me wants to like this game more than I currently do.  It's at its best when you at least have the Ladybug expansion, otherwise the game could feel like it's stalled, almost like it's begging for a couple more bugs to use.  Ladybug expansion highly recommended.  If you enjoy the game enough, definitely get the Mosquito too.  Or just save yourself the trouble and just get the carbon edition.

In a nutshell, it's a light abstract strategy game.

I don't play too many two-player perfect information games, but I'm quite taken with Hive.

I've only played a handful of times, but I expect to continue enjoying this clever little puzzler for many years.

I appreciate this game for its simplicity and ease of introduction to pretty much anybody. It doesn't feel overly abstract, but that quality is definitely there for those who are looking for it. That being said, it IS abstract enough to dissuade my wife from ever playing it again.

I normally like games where you don't get to do things. But the bind Hive puts a novice player in isn't interesting or fun. It's just "bet you wish you'd played this 10 times already so you knew which obvious blunders to avoid".

I could easily imagine that if I got better at abstracts, I might come back to this and enjoy it. (If I avoid an obvious blunder when first playing a Euro game, it's not because I'm genius, it's because I've played similar games before.) On the other hand, I gave it a try because I *am* getting better at abstracts, and this one still feels the learning process would be an annoying slog.

This game has been here since the beginning of my dive into hobby boardgames. I've played this with everyone and in every situation, the game is tight and deep, and got tons of mileage out of the base set. That led to the italicised comments as we burnt out on the game. Tying each other multiple rounds in a row dropped the game down to a 7 for me at one point. 

However, I don't know that a night has gone by that this game hasn't at least been suggested by [b]someone[/b]. More often than not I'll start a game with people on time and the stragglers who show up late will play Hive while they wait for us to finish, sometimes ending up reluctant to stop. The only thing stopping this from hitting a 10 for me is that it's swung in and out of my personal favor, even if my friends wont shut up about it.

"[i]The base set made me feel as though there is little room for variation in openers, but very significant complexity to the mid game. The game tended to have conclusions which seem forgone from a few moves out though. Spiders feel overly weak.

Base game results in a tie more frequently than I would like, but is generally interesting. [/i]"

Expansions add so much, highly recommend them, bumping this up to an [-]8[/-] 9! with the expansions. Pillbug is especially essential, then Mosquito, then Ladybug could probably be done without. Chess clock is a good addition as well.

Have the Mosquito, Ladybug, and Pillbug

A filler abstract!  I love it!  There's just enough going on to have the depth that I want in an abstract, but it's not so brain-burny that I have to be in full-on "think mode".  Plus it comes with a travel bag.  I anticipate playing this one for some time.

RATING: 8
Brilliant, tense little number. You're afraid to commit to each move in case you're signing your own death warrant. 

A few ambiguities in the rules (what happens when you cover the only opposing piece on the board with a Beetle - do they miss their turns until you've moved it?) mar things a little, but for the most part it works exceedingly well. 

I can imagine a pair of players both getting so good at it that every game turns into a drawn-out stalemate, but we're a long way off that level of play yet. A LONG way off.

Absolutely hideous.  I don't know what game these people were playing, but it wasn't the one I played.  It comes with perhaps the worst rules ever written for a game.  I played three games: I sorta-won the first two because we got into situations not covered by the horrid rules, and we gave up on the third game because it had already taken so long and it was apparent that no one was ever going to win.

from my first few plays, this looks like a really solid 2-player abstract. The player who begins seems to have an advantage because he can attack first, and the other player will have to make some defensive moves, somehow trying to steal the initiative from the starting player (which is definitely possible).

Great for outdoor play  (also on sand) as it comes with a bag and heavy pieces.

Hive is fun as far as it goes, but it's not simple or elegant enough to join the pantheon of truly great abstracts. The tile distribution seems somewhat arbitrary (why three ants, exactly?), and the tension of running out of pieces is ruined by the expansions. Still, the chunky bakelite tiles are a pleasure to play with. It's fun, easy to learn, and attractive. I won't turn down a game, but there are so many fabulous abstracts out there, that I won't suggest a game either.

The perfect little filler for two, pretty much the successor of Chess in this departement in our household. We actually get to play this as well, unlike many longer games that suffer from what I guess could be called the baby syndrome (no time, no time!).

The game does have quite a bit of strategic depth to explore. That you don't lose your pieces doesn't mean they can't become useless - like when they're all trapped and you can't get the ones you really need. Trapping and counter-trapping all the time, the game goes to and fro, occasionally a queen makes a mad dash, and the shape of the hive changes all the time.

A very enjoyable game indeed.

While it may not be as deep or as elegant as the GIPF series, this strikes me as the most accessible (and most available) abstract strategy game (without sacrificing depth). 

While it may seem bizarre to have expansions for an abstract game, the possibility of adding more bugs to this already modular game is much welcome (although not needed). Notably, the first two expansions (i.e., Ladybug and Mosquito) add a far greater degree of offensive capability.

[2nd edition, Initial Impression: 8]
This portable and attractive little game is a near perfect take-anywhere light strategy exercise for two.  Each game has a feeling of depth, while only taking 15-30 minutes. The game is essentially a race to surround the opponent's queen bee.  The strategy mainly comes down to counting "moves to win" - when your opponent has fewer moves to win (the first player will always start out with fewer), your job is to slow them down while simultaneously providing mobility and flexibility for your pieces so that you can regain the lead in "moves to win". When you have fewer "moves to win", you need to find multiple moves that will provide the win so that your opponent can't successfully defend. The first-mover advantage seems to be only slight, in that the second player will have to play defensively in the beginning, but clever pinning of your opponent's pieces can provide a later advantage. It is fun to play around with different strategies and to see how the balance of your game can quickly change from defensive to offensive, or vice versa.

Nice little abstract with some interesting options. The obvious comparison is chess but since the game area is defined by the 6-sided pieces and not by a grid it is a much more fluid situation and picture.
Terrific concept- can't wait to try it out with my daughter sometime.
Downgraded this to a straight 7 - this is beginning to seem more programmed to me now, and carries bit less interest than it did when the games differed. (Of course, I also play solo a lot...)  Still a good game, but not as great as I hoped for it.

Excellent 2-player game.  Easy to teach, quick to play, and lots of opportunity for strategic moves.  Like chess in that you can try to anticipate possible future moves by your opponent, but enough variety to keep it reasonably light.

A great two player game. It is move and and countermove. As you play more you will need to look more moves ahead and develop more sophisticated counter moves.

My (now ex-)girlfriend absolutely loves this game (largely because she beats me about 80% of the time) and that has left me a bit burned out on or I'd probably rate it higher. This is a nearly ideal pub game.

Came back to this after a break and revised my rating upward. This is a perfect casual abstract game. Abstract game = simple rules & quick playing. The light theming makes it appeal to more casual gamers.

(It is "previously owned" because I gifted my copy to a friend who was going to East Timor for 2 years.)

Chess-like game (ie. each piece has a distinct move), where the hexagonal pieces (bugs) are the board.  Surround the queen bee to win, but aggressive defenxe is the key.  Sounds interesting, and 10-30 mins play-time.

RATING: 6
A fun little light abstract. Like Chess you have to learn how each piece moves, so there's a little book work before you can play. I'm not sure it's very deep, success seems to consist of pinning your opponent's queen and then filling in the 'gaps' before they do the same to you. I would suggest that the game could be deepened by having fewer ants and grasshoppers, more spiders and beetles. Fine as an iPad app, I won't be buying the physical game.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite abstract games. Player use their different insect tiles to form a hive (the playing area) and try to completely surround your opponents Queen Bee. This can be done using your or your opponents tiles. What makes this so fun is that each insect moves in the Hive in a different way. Grasshoppers can only jump, beetles crawl on top of the hive, spiders move quickly in spaces of three, ants can pretty much move anywhere, and queen bee's can only move one space at a time.

I like to use this as a good chess replacement because it really has the same idea of capturing your opponents most important piece. Though unlike chess, there is no removing pieces. Instead, good strategies involve a lot of blocking. That happens because there are two golden rules that cannot be broken: 1) You cannot break the Hive into more that one Hive. 2) You can never force a tile into a slot that it couldn't normally slide into.

The quality of the tiles is EXCELLENT! They're thick and heavy. There's nothing that could be improved.

It's an easy to learn, difficult to master, complete-information game that rewards good tactics and playng so that the better player always wins. And because of it's small size and portability, it's the perfect game to take to a pub (the sturdy tiles won't mind a few stains either and are easy to clean)!

Fantastic abstract game.  Scratches my itch to play a thinky chess-like game without taking several hours.  Your decisions need to be thought out, but AP never becomes too much of a problem.  Its main flaw is that setup and early moves feel somewhat scripted.

with each subsequent play I find I like this game less and less. It's not a bad game it's just kind of meh. I'd rather play other two player board games like jaipur, patchwork, or battle line. Hive is good, especially with the expansions but it's not something that I think of and go, "man I could go for a good game of hive right now"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I tend not to be terribly drawn to abstracts for whatever reason, but Hive is a nice Chess-like game that has the advantage of being short, inviting, and accessible.  The self-limiting nature of the game reduces the AP to a minimum while still allowing for creative and strategic play.  Hive can be whatever you want it to be - hardcore strategy for the top-level players, a pleasant diversion for the casual players.

Hive is a simplified, insectoid re-imagining of Chess. If you know how to play Chess, then you'll pick Hive up quickly. Different insects offer different moves, all in the pursuit of blockading your opponent's queen bee piece. The game is wonderfully designed and looks great. As an added bonus, it is super easy to take along as a travel game.

Second Edition

The components are among the highest tier in my collection and boost my rating way more than they should.  I burned myself out on the Java applet of Hive a while back but have recently been reinvigorated by playing face to face (it's a whole different game).  Hive is a more interesting and shorter version of Chess to me.  It's compact, simple, yet deep and engaging.  This along with Carc is probably one of my most played games, enjoying much love and attention.  It gets bonus points for being boardless and playable virtually anywhere with a flat surface.  My girlfriend and I often cart it along to restaurants while we wait for the meal or outside to enjoy in the sun on the grass.  What other games can you do that with?

Seems a lot like a more fluid and less scripted Chess.  Then again, I don't like Chess that much anyway.

And after playing it, that's pretty much my assessment.  It is definitely a much more intriguing version of chess.  I like how the "board" evolves and flows.  However, I don't really like chess, so saying this is better than chess isn't saying much.

I'll give it some more tries later maybe.

Nov08: So silly me.  I picked it up in a trade.  Maybe it was the bits.  The actual game does seem a little more fun when I'm not playing it in the dark on an ottoman.

"Deceptively Simple".  I believe these two words, uttered multiple times during fits of brain-cramping frustration, accurately describe this game.  I very much like the lack of any sort of random element, and I like the fact that it is incredibly simple to pick up as a newcomer.  The theme of the game is almost negligible; after understanding how each piece can move, the game becomes less about warring colonies of insects and more about an intense battle of wits between players.

A very good abstract strategy game. Can be chess-like, with each player studying the board silently for several minutes before making a move, which obviously will add to the length of the game.

Finally took it out and played 3 games with my kids.  It is another game that once you start playing, it all gels and makes sense.  I managed to lose 3 times through stupid mistakes, which makes me want to play more.  Have the older wood version with shiny decals.  Nifty little game.  Kids like too!

Hive is an OK abstract strategy game. It is quite easy to teach, has a nice quirky theme and handy to take on travels (with nice pouch packaged in the box). I am not really big fan of modern abstract strategy titles, so I don't have much fun playing Hive. I will happily take it for holidays to pass on some occasions, but if I have space to take Pandemic, Carcassonne or other thematic games, that would be my preference. If you like abstract strategy games, try it out.

Extremely interesting game!

The placement of pieces and the movement is very interesting. I think what really gets me is how you can strategically move pieces to lock other pieces in. Very, very fun.

Have both the old wood version and the new bakelite version. Game is good enough to own both!

Some mental challenge.

Sadly, the advantage of the starting player is visible. But I'm not an expert to claim that it cannot be overwhelmed..
Still, the player who gains an initiative will keep it until the bitter end for his opponent.  *Big* minus for this.

One more thing - one mistake and you are screwed (you lose initiative or if you lost it already, your end comes much faster).

RATING: 7
A nice light abstract that plays very fast with no AP and games are short and also addicting as well(very similiar to Pente in all these ways). A little more depth than first appears (kinda like clans) but not a whole lot, some strategy but its far more tactical, makes a good 2 player game for weeknights. I question the replay value here but the fact that its so portable makes it great for camping or the like. I'm not sure I would ever buy it (I have some games for this niche in my collection so it depends on price) but making it seems like a good option. Play online here to see if you like it against fairly strong AI: http://www.hivemania.com/vgame/

Update: 6.5 => 7 Slight rating increase, after a bunch more plays I still like it and I may have to pick it up. I still wonder if the first player has too much advantage but it is not every game for sure as I have played a couple neat games where momentum swung back and forth. Also, after some repeated plays you do tend to use the same 2 or 3 strategies so it doesn't have the breadth in strategies in something like Chess. It is a strategy game but it does feel more tactical as the board changes so drastically limited your effective planning to maybe 3 or 4 turns ahead and even then you often have to change your plan before that depending on the board, so it's not a Chess replacement but it makes a great fast and portable strategic filler. 

Update: 7 => 7.5 Aquired - Well some games do go simply along but wow some others really get swingy and take on a character of their own. The bee movement really can change the pace of the game and it becomes very crafty. The damn AI sure improved from when I played it last I think, the link changed too http://www.hivemania.com/play  I also bought this due to speed versus depth ratio and you literally can play the new version anywhere which I will be taking advantage of

Update: 7.5=>7 Hah back to 7. Well the limited depth is bothering me now, especially after playing chess a few times, games are taking on a certain pattern every game but at least it was good for a good 20 games, and you can't beat the versatility of literally playing anywhere!

I admit this is probably a good game, but if you know me than you know I don't like truly abstract games.  This game just solidifies my opinion.  I don't enjoy and don't "get" many abstract games, this is no exception.  The first few times I played it was interesting but losing again and again gets a bit boring and frustrating. It's just not my kind of game though I definitely think this will appeal to fans of abstract games.

There is no need to worry about this game stinging you, as it is simple to learn with a depth of strategic elements.

Guess I'm just not much of an abstract guy.  It's an okay game I'm just not an abstract player.  I prefer card games that are light weight over abstract board games.  It is however an interesting concept and I do like the different moves.  I only wish it wasn't so hard to win.  It feels more like a game of tic-tac-toe meets chess to me.  But that is just my opinion.

Hive is an excellent abstract game, especially for those who enjoy chess but are overwhelmed by all the possibilities at game start. Hive starts simple but ramps up very quickly and almost always feels like a tight contest in its short run time. It's an enormously enjoyable, elegant design that I highly recommend.

This game just keeps getting better the more I play it. The bakelite version is great for hauling around to restaurants.  I use a large dice bag with a drawstring instead of the supplied vinyl purse.  It screams "dork" a little less loudly when I'm in public.  Waitresses usually ask what we're playing, but deep down they think we're weird.

After 162 plays, I'm dropping my rating a bit.  At high level play, the Q-Q openings start to dominate.  It's a "you can't beat 'em so you better join 'em" situation.

A simple fix is now in use: No one can play the queen on their 1st move.

This game has probably seen more play than any other in my collection and for that reason alone it deserves to be a 10. It's robust and highly portable which means it can be played almost anywhere without fear of damaging it. As a result it goes almost everywhere with us. It's also an excellent brain burner of a game paced with tricky decisions but never so much that you feel overwhelmed. Add this to the short playing time which helps make it playable when out and about and you get a truly outstanding 2 player game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2010)

I´m not sure why but I didn´t like Hive at the beginning, but as I played more, I came to realize that Hive was indeed a very clever design. It is a 100% skill game and one I lose often but now I can appreciate the game. Experience matters a lot in this game. The bits are really well made and the play time is very short. The rules are fairly simple but the game has an amazing and surprising depth, easy to learn hard to master :devil:.

I love the fact that the game is so portable so I´m always ready for a game of Hive.

Nowadays, I almost always resist a game of Hive. I’m not sure why I almost always want to play another game than this (Dungeon Twister or Kamisado). This is a game I respect, so I got myself another copy of the game after I sold my previous one. I still have it in shrink and perhaps I will sell it soon. For that, I’m downgrading its rating to a 6.0.

**use the player aids on this site to help others remember how each unit moves**

This is a quick strategic game that has one of the best and tightest themes I've played. 

I can totally see the hive invasion as depicted in the 1970's educational films I saw in Elementary school. 

This game is very portable, very fun, and kind of like a free form chess (it should appeal to strategists); it is fairly luck free really. 

So, it's highly reccommended and great for pubs and coffee houses. 

I do find it over priced, but I wanted to support the individual designer as I like the game. I have the first edition (wooden blocked) and to keep the stickers in place, I shellaced the wood.

I like the new bakelite version, but I'm not going to buy it until my version is wrecked. :)

I love playing Hive, my students at school (teaching ELL in Spain) picked it up immediately and demand I bring it for recess now. My roommates are of mixed reviews, but generally enjoyed it. Most people I teach to play will immediately play a second game with me once learning and seem to enjoy it for it's abstract mechanics and uniqueness. It's super easy and fast to play (most games last about 10 minutes, 15 if you're both good players and constantly screwing each other over). Highly recommend for picnics, traveling (planes not cars as you need flat, stable surfaces), and family events anything 10/10
I must admit that I love the colors of the paint and the weight and size of the pieces is just AWESOME. It feels super great in your hand. I found myself desperately searching for the material (bakelite) and to see if it's possible to manufacture my own as I have MANY new bug ideas that would make the game really interesting without being OP or breaking it, but alas, it's made in labs, so I'll have to make due with the expansions that I bought! Those make the game take longer and way more intense (you have to strategize SO MUCH MORE with the mosquito, but the ladybug never seemed much of an issue tbh)

RATING: 9.5
Played it for about 3 hours straight... what can I say.. it's chess without the board. I feel it's a fantastic game and one that should be highly regarded, however, like chess, there is no random chance involved, so you need to match up to a relatively equal opponent or it wouldn't be a challenge or may feel insurmountable depending on which side you are on.

Things I love... many Strategies of offense/defense, calculated play, massive replayability, simple straight forward rules, learn in less than 5 minutes, and incredible critical thinking required to master, also if I do say so myself the pieces are of some of the highest quality resin I've seen in a board game. 

Things i don't like: 
First of all the graphics... I hate bugs... and my wife hates them more... this is the perfect game to whip out at a dinner table while traveling.. but that's a definite turn off... further the concept of a "Hive" makes perfect sense and I can't think of any alternative theme that would make sense... also the bugs provide the perfect platform to explain their mechanics and I don't see how that or the the "Hive" mechanic could be replaced.
Second, I haven't done enough research but I do not believe a third player would be possible... The game concept of surrounding the queen needs to be two players and alternating turns... it would be a huge disadvantage and bog down the game for more players. If there is a variation this would be awesome!
Lastly... The expansions should be included with the set upon update. they are quite expensive for what they are comparatively.

RATING: 9
An abstract 'bug' game for 2.  This is a game that is rather quick and straight forward in the early-game and then slowly transcends into a more thought provoking and engaging end-game.  Chess-like in tactics.  A nice compact game for travel (or patio). I recently picked up the Mosquito pair for this (color) base game set.

Un juego similar al ajedrez pero sin tablero.

Cada tipo de pieza tiene sus propias reglas de movimiento pero tan sólo hay unas cuantas y sus reglas son bastante fácil de recordar. He dicho que no hay tablero, pero eso no es cierto del todo, todas las piezas tienen que estar conectadas formando una cadena que no se puede romper. Una partida consiste en rodear la reina del enemigo.

Considero que este juego es táctico ya que no se puede desarrollar una estrategia a largo plazo.

Si estás buscando un quemacerebros que se pueda jugar es un periodo de tiempo razonable, éste puede ser una opción.

A chess-like game but without a board.

Each kind of piece has its own movement rules but there are only a few of them and its rules are very easy to remember. I said there is no board, but that's not really true, all pieces should be connected by forming a chain that can't be broken. A game consist in surrounding the enemy's bee.

I consider this game a tactic one because you can't develop a long term strategy.

If you are looking for a brainburner game that can be played in a reasonable period of time, this one can be an option.

An abstract game but with a nice theme and beautifull components. It reminds me very strong of chess, but it is much easier to play, because there are only 11 pieces per person and at any time only few pieces are able to move. (01 sep 08 after 18 plays)

Like chess, but not as dull! The only bad thing I can say about it is some of the moves seem arbitrary, especially the expansions, and that isn't very thematically satisfying. And for a quick game, it's sometimes more deep than my family and friends want it to be.

Fantastic game. Took me a while to get into it and realize what sort of strategy plays best but once I did, it became one of my favourites.
Also, quick to set-up (basically, separate black from white tiles and clear a little bit of room on a flat surface), and the waterproof components mean you can play it in the shower. Being a two-player game, this is perfect!

Perfect information abstracts are decidedly not my thing, but this one appeals in a number of ways: it's fast, it's extremely portable and durable, the pieces look and feel great, it can play out very differently from game to game (and especially, from one opponent to another), it has a cool theme tacked on.

Together with the Yinsh series Hive certainly is the most popular modern two-player abstract. It's a good game but it might be a bit too open and deep for me to get into it more.

I just love the look and heft of the Bakelite tiles. That may sound superficial, but it's not in such a tactile game as Hive. The gameplay is quite nice, too. The rules are pretty easy to grasp, but there's still quite a bit to do once you get into it. Advertised game length is actually right for once.

Update: This game just doesn't excite me all that much, as decent as it is, and it's been gathering dust after an initial flurry of plays. I'd certainly play it again, but I'm not itching to take it off the shelf.

A game without luck. Is similar to chess, however not that many books written about it so it is easier to find a player not a grandmaster. A game is deep enough, drawn insects are beautiful, but the most important thing is that it is durable - no board needed: tiles can be placed on any even surface. No paper (card stock) game elements.

Žaidimas be sėkmės elemento. Kažkuo primena šachmatus, tik ne tiek knygų apie jį parašyta, taigi ne taip sunku rasti žaidėją ne didmeistrį. Žaidimas pakankamai gilus, nupaišyti vabaliukai gražūs, o kas svarbiausia, jis yra patvarus - nereikia lentos, o kaladėles galima statyti ant bet kokio lygaus paviršiaus. Jokių popierinių detalių.

Fun, deep, and quick.  Surprising amount of strategy from only a couple of different pieces.  Each game only takes a few minutes but require a good deal of thought.

My new go-to abstract for non-gamers since YINSH got a little worn out, I really adore the simplicity of the rules; it requires careful attention to catch what your opponent is up to in some cases, even with only, what, ten or eleven pieces per side?

[PNP] It is like chess lite but the moves you can make are more open. I like the fact that all the pieces have different moves and some even go on top of others or move other pieces. Starting player advantage is a bummer for this even though there are variants to fix it(forcing the start player to play an ant first etc.). If you like abstracts you would probably like this one. I am not a abstract kinda guy that's all.

RATING: 5
Has a few things going for it: modularity, pick-up-and-go appeal, bugs, erratic movement and interplay that unifies credibly with theme. But I'm just not really into abstracts. Staring at the hive and figuring out all the potential placements and movements of all the pieces on the board is mind-numbing.

A nice, quick game completely broken by something: who goes first. That player essentially wins. He or she is always one block ahead of blocking in your bee, so sooner or later, the other player is forced to flee...and then the opponent starts the 1st block to fence your bee in. Again, you are behind by 1 turn. Fail!

Interesante juego, muy simple y a la vez divertido.

La calidad de los componentes es muy buena, incluso en la caja se incluye una mochilita pequeña con forma de balon para guardar las piezas en ella y poder llevarlas donde quieras (incluso a la playa), los componentes estan fabricados para eso, de buena calidad y resistentes.

Juego sencillo, donde darle a la cabeza es su mecanica. Me recuerda al ajedrez por sus posibilidades tacticas y el tener que pensar jugadas.

When stacking modern abstracts against each other, this one comes out on top. There are many great things about the game:

1) Portability
2) Durability - it will outlast the components of every other game you'll ever own, unless you own a solid wood Go set.
3) Simplicity
4) Infinite replayability

Imagine a game of chess that you could play in 10-20 minutes, that would always end in the opening or middlegame, and that didn't require an encyclopedic knowledge of specific strategies and tactics. That's Hive. The pieces are great, the rules simple, and let me just say this: best pub game ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Why do I give it a perfect 10?

- I love bugs and hence I love the theme of the game
- I'm only comparing it to other abstract games and compared to its equals I think it's close to perfection
- I like the idea of it being played without a board
- Ladybug and Mosquito ads complexity for those who like a more challenging game
- The game pieces are superb and in combination with not needing a board it's unusually portable for its category

The version I bought was Hive Carbon, which includes both the Mosquito and ladybug expansion. Since then I've also bought the Pillbug expansion. So far I really like the defensive qualities of the Pillbug piece.

I've played this several times; twice with my daughter [6] and about three times with a peer.  On line I've played about 20 times and think the AI is a bit weak especially if the Queen Bee variant rule is not used.  This is an amazing and elegant design and the pieces are a marvel.  

I had considered making my own copy using huge lug-nuts filled with Sculpy but the cost would be equivalent to a legitimate copy.  As such I've got the Carbon version on order.

I’m new to Hive and it amazed me. I was a Chess player with no opponents; too strong for my family and friends, too weak for AI and semipro players  at the club. This’s issea Chess replacementssw.         Set.  anyone can learn easily and we start at the same level SE with my wife and a friend. I know no other game of this depth in that size and price.  Portability and zero setup time are priceless. The Android version and BSA ensure I will always have an opponent for a quick game. The pieces are excellent checkers for droughts and mills and Pocket version costs as much as decent checkers set. Practically you get the game and bag for free!
What I don’t like? I don’t know, maybe the first player advantage, but the Pillbug is ordered and shipped. Draws are common in Chess too. Two players enjoy a draw when they know they played a good match. You don’t always have to kill your opponent, particularly if he is your wife or kid or friend. 
Alternative rules are possible and we could treat the tile sets as we treat a card or domino set, to play many different games. 28 tiles are the same with double 6 domino, they are enough, having in mind that they will always consist of two subsets. But we could always use two sets to 56, as much as a full card deck (with jokers, or mosquitoes) or a double 9 Domino. 
Overall it is ingenious and I just want to see how it stands the rest of time.

Hive is my favorite abstract strategy game. It is a quick game and the rules are simple but the strategy and depth is great. It is actually reminiscent of Chess though I think Hive should appeal to a much wider audience (I don’t like Chess much myself). 

Like Chess, It has various pieces that have different movement abilities but the way in which the pieces move is generally much more intuitive. For example, grass hoppers jump and beetles crawl on top of things. Also, unlike in Chess, pieces can never be completely lost. They can be trapped but it is always theoretically possible to free them up again.

The most important difference from Chess though is that the decision tree is much less paralyzing (though still complex enough to be interesting). There is still plenty of room to gain advantage by planning ahead, but at any given time there are a fairly limited number of pieces that can actually move so it is much less brain burning to consider each of them. 

Finally, the game is also set apart by the unique mutating playing area caused by the fact that there is no board ... all pieces in play simply have to remain in contact with one or more other pieces in play. 

I’d highly recommend Hive to any fan of abstracts and I think it is even worth trying if you don’t like abstracts due to the various unique and thematic elements that set it apart from that category of games.

Solid 2 player tile placement game where you attempt to box in your opponent's queen. Tiles have a depicted bug type that has a specific power. This game gives me a chess-like feel (i.e. different pieces and variable powers) with the vying for control of the board that you're building out. If you're looking for a good quick two player abstract game, this is the one!

Hive is one of those pleasant surprises you find from time to time. I had been hearing of it for quite some time, but just didn't seem to grab my attention. Thankfully, I was able to give it a try when a friend and I were bored, waiting for the rest to appear, before our gaming session at our local game bar.

Pure abstracts tend to have a simple set of rules, deep mechanisms and zero luck. Hive is all this, while also keeping its length towards the short side. Obviously, it isn't nearly as deep as Go or Chess, but it's way apart from other so-called classics such as Checkers.

If two player abstracts is something you'd want to try, or you are already familiar with them and want a lighter one to fill a gap in your collection, grab Hive.

We like tactile games and the plastic pieces feel good and look like they last forever. It sure does look nice. my girlfriend does not like mosquitoes. Neither do i. So it never reaches the table. 

We added a house rule to draw randomly a tile from the bag, that decides who plays first given by the alphabetic order of the name of the bug (so ant goes before queen). then add the two together, they form the starting pieces. Draw the queen plus 2 more, You must play those 3 first. Then get the others. Makes life simpler and adds variety without any hassle.

I intend to keep it to show to friends and acquaintances and after that it may leave the house.

Not advisable for couples, but would be nice for parent/child game.

Of course if you get it, you MUST get the pocket hive version!

Very good quick abstract.  Easy to teach and strategy is deep.  Reduced rating from an 8 to a 7.  I think I would be playing this game more in a situational basis regarding where I am going to play, when, etc.  For shorter games there are many others I would choose first.

Pretty addictive and surprisingly fun for a chess-like game. I wonder if at high level play the game feels samey or not. There are also some expansion bugs also, make it more exciting. Easily rated a 9 with the expansions, though I will leave an 8 for just the base game.

A beatiful game, clever rules and quick to play: it's Hive. So simple, so fascinating and so much tactical maneuvers available. And what is the best part, the game takes very little space so you can take it with you when you travel by train… 
I haven't play this very much, but I like it quite a lot and my rating might go up after few more games.

HIVE CARBON IS OUR FAVORITE PUB GAME: Of course the big hefty tiles being beer and grease proof is what allowed the game into the pub in the first place. But I was soon surprised to find out what a unique abstract strategy it was. Fun fun fun. and people are so interested, which I normally wouldn't mind but I just want to play the game. I've started just handing over the rule booklet and looking away because the rules are so clear. 
This game is a winner.

Have both real version and iPhone/iTouch version.  Also play on Boardspace.net.  I really like Hive quite a lot, but I'm not sure if I would rate it as highly as I do if I got to play it more face to face (especially with more different people) because it is at least somewhat solveable and sadly does not retain some of the depth of some other abstracts.  Really outstanding starting out though. Hoping that the addition of the Ladybug (and ultimately the Pillbug) will further open the game up and revitalize it for me.

An ingenious game that comes close to the depth of chess. I like to think of it as chess-lite. I am so glad I finally purchased this. Hive is definitely my go to game to carry around when travelling as I usually know someone that would be willing to play a round, or two. It takes a just a game or two for new players to pick up and compete well against an experienced palyer. I highly recommend this for non-gaming partners as the components are almost as compelling as the gameplay to just about everyone.

Solid abstract that doesn't feel like an abstract:  the movement is tied to what you'd imagine each bug would do.  The whole concept of the hive has beauty to it, and I love that the game is so portable.  

I don't feel that there's any kind of chess-like depth to the game, but browsing through some articles about the game on this site makes me reconsider.  

The major thing I dislike about it is that the Spider pieces seem tacked-on and poorly thought out.  It's basically just a very weak version of the Ant.  I wish the designer had come up with something more interesting for it to do.

UPDATE:  Been playing recently on Boardspace.net.   The Mosquito is a nice option, it adds a twist to the game and forces you to consider more possibilities during your look-ahead.  Good play seems to require using the "one hive" rule to limit your opponent's movement options.

Don't be fooled by the deceptively simple goal of this game (to surround the enemies 'queen bee' piece with your own pieces), the various abilities of the different pieces, the restrictions arising from playing without a board and the almost chess-like planability of future moves keep this one very intersting.

A lot of games try to reinvent the wheel, but few manage to succeed.  This is basically a very clever variant on chess, with some complications based on layout -- but chess just the same.  It tends to be a little divisive; some folks really like it and others hate it, based largely on how well-disposed they are to this style of strategic movement games in the first place.  I like them (although I'm not that good at them, so here we are!

It's a pretty nicely put-together game, with simple but iconic design and good, weighty pieces with a nice heft and texture but still portable.  Solid replay value, too, like any such game; there are some extensions available but I've never tried them.  I think it works pretty well on its own, so I'm satisfied.

RATING: 6
There's a great game to be had here, it's just not for me.  It has a chess-like aspect to it as the ultimate goal is to surround your opponent's queen bee.  Each player has the same amount of insects/arachnids, each of which move uniquely.  Personally, I would much rather play chess over this game but this has a lighter feel and definitely takes less time to play.  It's also great to play outdoors (picnics, etc.) since the hex pieces are chunky and heavy.  The wind isn't going to blow them away!

Generally, my wife does not like abstract games, and in particular more open-ended spatial games like Quoridor and Blokus failed to interest her. However, surprisingly she actually enjoyed Hive! Part of it, I think, is that she could focus on the individual pieces as in Chess. That somewhat narrowed down the spatial decision tree so she wasn't as overwhelmed. It's a short game and it's easy to get in a few rematches in. Plus, it's a great game to take with us since it's extremely portable and durable with the satisfyingly clackety tiles. The theme is just enough to help remember what most of the pieces do. All in all, even if you typically don't like abstract games, Hive is one to check out.

RATING: 7
Odd game, still haven't figured out how I feel about it.

Great icons, great pieces.  This is the one game that you can play anywhere including underwater.

I love each rule on how the pieces move.  It feels like there is a bit of theme in this abstract strategy game.  Much more theme than the average abstract, for sure.

You really have to learn how to defend from certain strategies, like when your opponent puts his beetle on your queen and then surrounds it.  That can feel like a bad experience once your realize, oh, there's nothing I can do to stop from winning.  But honestly, every abstract strategy game suffers from the same thing and I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing.  It's just something that you're either going to like abstract strategy games, or not.

Reccommended by my local shop a few months ago I have played this game several times and each time I have enjoyed the game.  Though I am nowhere near mastering the game I know that the chess-lineage and apparent simplicity of the game will give me several opportunities to play with friends.  Special mention must be given to John Yianni and Gen Four Two (are they the same?) for the quality of pieces and rulebook (though sadly this has increased the price) which have made this easier to introduce to friends and family.

I have only played a few games with the Mosquito and Ladybug, but feel like they are very important to the game to not make it formulaic between experienced players (between newbies and an experienced player, the game develops very differently every time, and while the experienced player will almost always win, this adds a lot more variety). This is one of a few games I feel has enough depth for board gamers while still getting nongamers hooked very easily. Plus, it's portable and affordable.

EDIT: Beetle adds a whole new layer (both literally and figuratively) to this game once you know what you're doing, and breaks the maximum possible turn efficiency possible with the other pieces.

This game rocks.  It's like a more accessible chess; bright colors, bug-themed tiles (that move appropriately for their respective buggy personalities), and plays in 20 minutes.

Pleasantly chunky, the Bakelite pieces are very satisfying to play with.

A simple and quick game, but amazingly deep for such.  The Bakelite pieces are gorgeous and perfect for the game, and the rules are easy enough to teach in a few moments.  The game almost feels Chess-like sometimes, with its goal of "checkmating" the opponent's Queen Bee, but it's a lot more modular and fluid than Chess.  Good fun.

Picked this up at the request of my wife.  It looked like an ideal 'on the couch' game, quick and portable.  And it is..but somehow it doesn't get played as much as such a game should.  We just didn't find it as engaging as we thought we would.  Adding in the extra pieces might help, but the remembering what the pieces do part then becomes a problem.  I also have a niggling feeling it is not so deep as it first appears, that there is a lot less that the variety of the pieces and moves might suggest.  That said, it is still a clever design and beautifully tactile.

I'm not sure there's much I can add to what people already have said about this game. Hive is simply excellent. Its portability, its replayability, its slight resemblance to Chess, its ability to be played on any flat surface without a game board, its balanced piece movements...all of these things work in concert to make Hive one of the first games I think of when I'm in the mood for some interesting bouts over a few drinks.

A game with different insect tiles where you are trying to surround your opponents queen bee.  Each insect moves differently.  It is almost a blend between chess and dominoes.  It plays relatively quickly and is a much deeper game than it appears on the surface.  

It is a great game for coffee shops or the beach and traveling.  It is abstract and as long as you like those types of games, I strongly recommend it.  Also, it is a game that has a learning curve and has more layers that you know.

That could simply be because I don't want to devote the time to chess to be really good at it and Hive is mostly played at a social rather than tournament level.  

Update:  Having played many games, including an online tournament, it is apparent that a draw can very nearly be forced by early play of the queen.  It is a pattern which, if not intentionally avoided, can wring much of the fun out of the game.  Further update:  The no-first-turn-queen-bee rule does pretty well correct the draw issue.

I feel like my rating of this game will go up as I play it more, but two-player games just don't hit my table too often.  It's a very enjoyable abstract game, and it lives up to the hype, I just don't think I understand the strategies well enough.

Picked up June 2006

Homemade version made of Sculpey clay.

Saw this game and I had to make my own set to try it out. I still suck at it but I like the simplicity of it. Polymer clay and adhesive labels...and maybe some adhesive magnetic sheets if you want to play on your fridge. This was a great way to try the game out to see if my wife liked it (she didn't).

I think this is a great game but I have no one to play this with.

Finally got the Bakelite edition. Really nice!

Keeper.

Wanting the Carbon edition.

Ordered this online after playing this with Darthnice.  I wanted a shorter game that I could play with anyone, like my kids or with my dad who will visit me soon.

Chess-like play, and a great theme for one that is pasted-on.  The game pieces are very nice.

Chess and Shogi are beasts. They make me feel very cognitively inadequate, and honestly I don't think I will ever have the tenacity to get to point where I am truly enjoying them. Enter Hive - First off, the pieces are tactile and...cool! Also, it provides a similar experience as the aforementioned games in a fraction of the time with just enough choices to make, that it is possible to have a good grasp on the game fairly quickly and already start to have fun. I find that playing with all the expansion pieces is where the game really shines.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
"Hive", with its original rules, has a blatant draw problem if the starting player (or worse: both players) opens with the Queen-Bee.
In tournaments therefore this opening has been banned (and apparently the author John Yianni agrees with that).
In my view this new rule should become standard, since the previous version has nothing at all to commend it.
"Hive" is an original and rich game, and deserves to be played with the best rule set (in which case I would rate it a solid 7).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a highly popular abstract, and I can see why. It has pieces that can move differently - like chess - but it retains the simplicity and elegance of an abstract that chess lacks. I need to play this a few more times to really get a feel for it, but I suspect it's a game that will have a long table life.

i love this game! as soon as it arrived my partner and i played 20 games straight just getting down all the angles and working out the different tactics. It's really good fun and fairly quick to play. As you continue playing you work out things such as the spider you first thought was weak can actually win in sneak attacks since it is usually overlooked in favour of more overtly powerful pieces like ants and that you can win playing defensive if you block your opponent until they run out of pieces.

A solid thinking game that it quick to pick up and plays swiftly too. I love the tactile bakelite pieces and the carry bag. These attributes plus the absence of any board to play the game make it an ideal travel game.

I rate this game a solid 8 and it is a worthy addition to the games collection.

I was expecting this to be better, so I was a bit disappointed.  I guess I am jaded after playing Arimaa so much.  Despite the different types of pieces - which I normally like in Abstract games, the game lacks variety because there is only one way to win - pin the opposing queen.  It has nowhere near the depth of skill levels as Arimaa and thus came off as a very take it or leave it type of game for me.  One plus is that it is very quick to play and therefore doesn't have to be played seriously.

My girlfriend and I play this constantly.  We were very skeptical about the theme... because really, bugs?  I'm not against insects, just seemed uninspiring.  

Turns out, it is extremely fun!  High replay value, short learning curve, but never feels easy to dominate.  Comparisons to chess seemed lofty when I first read them, but I think it's accurate.  We love this game, and the reasonable price and small size (we didn't get the travel-sized, but the regular Hive Carbon is small enough to take anywhere) make this a great purchase.  

After several months of ownership we are still playing and still loving it.  Zero regrets for buying this new.  And the Carbon version (comes with Mosquito and Ladybug expansions as of 2016 in Canada) is great. I thought the black and white (vs coloured) might be dull, but it isn't at all.  Happy Hiving :)

This is totally premature, but I really liked this game after one play. In a weird way, it met my expectations exactly, neither better nor worse. I guess it's because the game is not too complex, and therefore it's relatively easy to get an idea of whether you would like it or not before actually playing it. My rating probably has some bias (positive bias), but again, it's just preliminary.

Update 3/19/2013: This game is addicting!

Update 2/16/2014: I still really enjoy this one. Bound to be a true classic!

Update 3/12/2014: Played with Erin tonight. She beat me bad, winning 6 out of 7 games. I don't hold this against the game at all. In fact, it amplifies my thoughts on the game. That is, instead of getting frustrated and thinking there is something "wrong" with the game, I'm excited to get better. Awesome game!

Fun game with beautiful pieces, but I think the first player has an advantage that is difficult to overcome.

I love that the game is chess-like but the pieces ARE the board.
I have the wooden and bakelite editions.  I'm trading away the wooden one if you're interested.

I lead 4th grade boys at church and this never fails to draw their attention.  They can learn it pretty quickly and the small form factor means that I can keep it with me to play almost anywhere.

Suffers (quite badly) from the tic-tac-toe syndrome: if you go first, you will win.  If you don't mind this (how quickly can you win?  what new ways can you find to win?  how quickly will my opponent win when she goes first next time?) then this is a very clever little game.

What a great abstract game. The pieces are made from bakelite so are perfect for playing on all types of surface. I enjoy playing this with mates in the pub with a few pints of ale. I imagine this is the game they play in 80's sci-fi films when there is a scene in a run down bar.

Hive is a nice little 2 player abstract game.  In it players take turns placing pieces out into the play area.  The pieces depict various types of bugs.  Each bug has a unique movement ability.  The object of the game is to have your opponent's Queen Bee completely surrounded.

I like it.  The game plays pretty quickly.  The tiles are made of chunky Bakelite that feel good in the hand.  If you like abstract games, or want a fast playing 2 player game then check this one out.

Interesting game. I like the tiles, and look forward to learning some strategy. After many, many plays I have upped my rating on this to 8 (was 7.5) - I find it is very hard to win and can depend on your opponent making a mistake, as much as you making good moves. Much like chess, without the hour long setup to the endgame!

RATING: 7
Very good chesslike game that seems to inspire even those who don't like chess, although it's not really any more strongly themed or anything.  Definitely worthy of study but easy enough to get into that playing casually is rewarding too.  Since it isn't as mainstream as chess, it also hasn't reached the same level of dedication; lots of general gamers of varying Hive strengths are willing to play, which I can't say has been true of chess in my experience (usually the only ones who want to play chess are chess lifers).

Traded away. I think abstract games tend to require multiple plays to really enjoy and in my case, I have enough games that if one isn't enjoyable in the first few plays it tends to fall by the way side. For this reason, I don't think abstract games are really for me.

It's kind of like chess, but with a board that changes. I kind of like it, though it's not my type of game (I'm prone to AP). I like the theme better than chess.

Edit: I fell for it online. I actually can learn this game... :) I won't record online plays.

Edit 2: given the game away as a present. I play it online, or I want to take it with me (and then the pocket version is better).

Edit 3: I added the 2nd edit somewhere in spring 2013. Just now (start 2014) I got a call from the friends I gave the game to. They had finally given this game a chance. They liked it and my friend can (still) see the pieces. It's strange to notice how long it will take before people pick up games they have in their closet. I think my friends are 'holiday-gamers' ;). Great to hear some feedback on games I gave away!

Strategy does not seem too deep. Looking to pin opponent to take consecutive turns. There are better 2 player games I'd rather play.

I was asked to play again. Gave it another chance, and definitively not something that I want to do again. (this was about 5 years after the 1st play

Interesting abstract game that needs practicing and more practicing to learn the tricks.
The games repeatedly ran into a situation that the losing player has not many available moves. And the ending of this game usually stales. So the time of "waiting to be killed" is too long, just like an insect being trapped in a spider web.

Hive is uncommonly good for an uncommon combination of reasons.  Tons written about its speed/complexity etc, but really ponder the greatness of a game so well manufactured that you don't have to worry about damaging the components!  Soapbox aside, the game is blazingly fast, but more importantly it is unlike other abstracts in that the game doesn't at all feel like one person slowly depleting another's units leading to that feeling of a slow, boring loss.  Hive is fast and fresh with a pace that builds to the finish, making you just want to play one more, one more, one more.  What's more, the variety of units and the modularity of the board and unit introduction make me think it will be a very long time before the game becomes centered on measured gambit style play.

Very good little 2 player game, attractive and easy to take with you. Good for playing in bars as well. I'd be interested in a multiplayer expansion as well.

Update august 07: This game just keeps getting better. Another notch up in rating.
March 08: After one year of playing, and loads of games, I dare to say this is THE modern classic abstract.

Update march 08: I guess this is my favorite abstract, just a notch above Yinsh because of it's easy "play it everywhere" nature. Probably my most played game.

One of my very few abstract games that plays out a lot like chess except with insects!  I LOVE the thick bakelite tiles and cool insect drawings.

Fun little abstract, not tried the "expansions" yet. A bit too chess-like for me to really love, but it's quick and easy to grasp and the portability is second to none (or very few heh)

RATING: 7
Very compact game in both size and scope.  The instructions are not very clear, but if you can wade through the somewhat convoluted wording, it's actually quite simple to play.  Great for kids.  Excellent production value on the pieces, though the game is a bit pricey.  This game would travel very well.  Good game.

This is a very good game. Its portability, along with its ease of teaching and learning, nearly make this a great game.

Game in a Nutshell: Use your bugs to move around the hive and surround your opponents queen.

Two-player only.

Pros: Really a simple game, takes a couple minutes to explain the rules and then off you go. After that there's plenty of nuances to the game left to explore. Portable. One of those games that's visually beautiful to play. And finally, this is probably the most appropriate theme ever pasted on an abstract. 

Cons: The replay will probably wain as one person becomes stronger and wins the majority of the time. The abstract nature of the game comes forward pretty quick and time of play may lengthen as it becomes a think fest. Not exactly a light game despite its pick-up and play aspects.

Other: The bake-lite version sounds nice and durable and is probably the preferable choice but I'm quite happy having the wood version to play and learn with (especially for a quarter of the price). If I happen to wear out the wood, then maybe it'll warrant a well-deserved upgrade.  

Best Use: Another nice quick 'game-break' type game that can be played over coffee or during lunch.

It's as light or heavy as you're willing to play it. Expansions are keeping it fresh! Good for any age - and the tiles are amazing. The storage bag however, is horribly designed - looks cheap and makes it seem like a soccer game. Does the wonderful pieces a disservice. But luckily, you don't use the bag to play the game, just for storage.

The nice chunky tiles are the highlight of this game.  I allowed my kids to play with the pieces before they turned 2 - something that was impractical with all of my other hobby games at the time.

The game play just did not grip me, however.  I would much prefer to play many other 2-player abstract strategy games (Othello is a current favorite).

As the BGG image gallery shows, this is playable in many different settings and environments. For me, it is just not worth the trouble...

01/24/2013:  This is an excellent 2P abstract where you each control a group insects trying to surround the opponent's Queen Bee.  There is no board, only thick, hefty tiles which, when played, form a kind of hive of bugs on the table.  There are five different insects, each of which have a different movement feature (as chess pieces).  I've only played this a couple of times so far, but there is some strong strategy involved.  If you enjoy 2P games, I think this is a must have with it's easy rule set, portability, awesome components, and lots of replayability as you learn the strategy of good play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice design.  The insect theme works well (all insects must be kept in the hive, ie. tiles must always be connected like in Gods).  The different movement capabilities of each insect also follows suit.

hmm... you say "Chess-like" as if that's a good thing. this is an unfair rating since I've only played against the computer, but Dvonn for example is a much better execution of the concept of immobilization, and there are just so many 2-player games that appeal to me more, so it's a 6 for now. What I need to do is put this in a cage match with Fibonacci, Octi, maybe some games that begin with Q... what am I missing? and see who makes it out alive.

Upping my initial rating as I've played a few times FTF and beginning to appreciate the mobility issues. But, it seems to me too hard to get out of "check", and I'm not convinced that's going to balance out positively.

Ideal lunch game! Looks great, and the one-hive rule that excludes the need for a board is fantastic.

I own the wooden edition. How odd to be addicted to bug-chess...
-----------------------

Here is why this game is so brilliant:
1) Depth without complexity
2) Short game length. Average games last ten minutes or so here.
3) Portability - Indeed I'd argue this is the consummate travel game. I've played this on airplanes, the beaches of Mexico, on a boat in the middle of the Ionian Sea, in hotel lobbies throughout Europe, by the poolside, and in the middle of the wilderness while camping and backpacking.

For a while I was concerned at the frequency of stalemate because of the first player advantage, but what I found is that there is a breaking point - I might play five or six games to stalemate, and then in the next games as a player tries to subvert the likelihood of stalemate, strategies mutate and there is a quick back and forth of victories.

Indeed this game gets played SO much (mostly at lunch or on the road while traveling) that I probably have at least another 30-40 unrecorded plays. It is and will remain my most played game.

This is a terrific strategy game, as someone who loves chess, while not the same thing, is similar in trying to be several moves ahead of your opponent at all times.  Its a rather easy game to pick up and learn, after one game I was pretty confident in how everything work and was able to play several more games.  The tiles feel nice to pick up and place around, they have a decent weight so as they aren't moving too much when they shouldn't.  Admittedly I'd say the expansions are a requirement to get a full experience from the game, but thats not really an issue per se.  If you like two player, chess like games, this is the right thing for you.

This game gives me the same feeling as chess but without the major brain burn that can occur during a match.

Maybe some day, but currently i'm not looking for a game where someone who knows the strategy can crush someone else who is new. I want to get people to enjoy playing board games.

It's okay, but my experiences with it have been less than stellar. Mostly it seems to hinge on one blunder, after which both sides just play out the obvious moves.

A modern type of chess. Little bugs that are all trying to block the other's queen in their own way. Simple rules but oh so tactical! We have the pocket version which already includes the ladybug and the mosquito for the same price as the original.

The ladybug in particular is a plus in this game that seems so simple at first glance but that always brings you to the edge of your chair. Also nice that it's not really a 'board' game and that you can take it with you wherever you are (i.e. on holidays). One of the best abstract games for 2 players!  My wife doesn't like it that much as it is very cut throat and you need to master the moves of all bugs to play it well.

Quick to learn, quick to play. Tough to master (the constantly shifting combinations of pieces make me feel like I'm playing chess on the surface of a Rubik's Cube).

The bakelite pieces of the 2nd edition are beautiful.

If I were more into abstract strategies, this would be an easy favourite. As it is, it's a game I love to look at, but don't crave playing so much.

This is a purely abstract game with nice heavy bakelite pieces.  I rather like the look & feel of the game, but find it a bit dull.  The strategies are very subtle and I often find games to be one-sided: whether for me or for my opponent.  It never feels close or tense.  For the loser, the winning position is usually revealed in a sudden and unexpected manner.  Leaving the looser to wonder:  "what happened there?"

I don't play 2-player games often but this looked good enough to try out.  Having played it a few times, I find myself carrying around the little round bag and roping in people when I have 10-20 minutes free between other things.  This clever, rugged little game is trivial to explain and can be played quickly for fun or slowly for deep thought, so it fits most of my moods.

Usually abstracts aren't my thing and this one definitely has a pasted theme. However, I like this one just because it plays very quickly. Most my games only last 10 minutes so we can churn through multiple games at once. I also love the thick chunky tiles and love that the game is very portable (my version even game with an option bag you can store them in as opposed to the box).

Gyakorlat híján tipikusan az a sakk játékos vagyok, aki perceket gondolkodik egy lépésén. A Hive-nál ez nincs így, pörög egy játék és jöhet is a visszavágó! Mondanom sem kell, hogy verhetetlen vagyok benne!:) A sakkal való hasonlítgatás szerintem igen is helytálló. A Hive egy modern, könnyedebb, számomra sokkal szórakoztatóbb sakk-klón (hiszen gyakorlatilag ugyan az a cél nem?)

Én a pocket verziót vettem meg. Fele annyi pénzért még a 2 kiegészítő is benne van. Sőt, nagy örömömre a legújabb rovar együtt jön a pocket verzióval! Ha lesz itthon kapható, valakivel szívesen felezek majd!:)

I decided on "pocket" Hive, because I wanted something that was light and easy to transport in a backpack without taking up too much space, and without running the risk of being damaged. Hive is a very entertaining, Chess-like game of insects with varying powers. The object? Surround the bee!

Bueno, bueno, bueno... qué J U E G A Z O. Nos encanta. Además de que las piezas son preciosas (baquelita Power!) es un juego que te hace pensar pero sin ser excesivamente complejo.
Fácil de aprender, aunque difícil de dominar. Aún siendo abstracto la temática le viene como anillo al dedo. Super transportable y fácil de sacar a la mesa. Es de esos que no te lo piensas dos veces porque no necesita ningún despliegue.
100% recomendable. Un MUST HAVE.

I have mixed feelings about this one: it's really a gem when it comes to portability and durability. But somehow it does not attract any of my friends, and therefore I very rarely play it. When I do I always have a good time. 

One fun thing is that although the possible moves and options in the game are enormous, it always comes down to a few choices, which make the game feel somewhat shallow. Make no mistake though, I like this one!

Fantastic abstract game! Picked this up on vacation to Mackinaw Island, as it has sturdy, thick plastic components that can't get ruined or blown away in a strong wind. Highly recommended. Each piece has a special ability, and the goal is to protect the queen, which lends it to feel a little like chess. Pick this up!

Update: This game continues to be one of our favorites, especially once you add the pillbug expansion. Highly recommended!

RATING: 5
Hive made me discover that I have this unhealthy relationship with most abstract games, mostly born of petty considerations. I don't share the opinion of many people who express their dislike of abstracts (i.e. "the game is dry/soulless"); as a result I've probably restrained myself from saying (or thinking) that I don't get the appeal of a majority of them in order not to be mistaken for those critics, because that would send conflicting messages relatively to my gameplay-centric approach of board gaming. But the reality is that your average abstract game shares common characteristics that are off-putting to me:

- The game gets noticeably clearer as players get closer to the victory condition. Which is a nice way to say that the initial moves (or sometimes the setup) are very, very arbitrary rather than interesting.
- Because of that, one of the players (save high level) is randomly putting themselves into an eventually obvious disadvantage before actual play begins.
- Improving is about slowly learning to recognise turn/piece patterns of exponentially increasing size. That means no strategy until you you've practised larger and larger tactics for god knows how long.

So in all honesty, I will probably never own any part of the GIPF project, no matter how great they sound on the paper, nor become a decent Go, Chess or Shogi player. But if those games appeal to you, Hive is pretty, portable, short, accessible and looks as much undecipherable.

A fantastic little game. Simple 2 player abstract strategy game a bit like Chess. That said, once you get to grips with the rules the depth shoots up and there's actually some really advanced and complex strategy to be had. What's also great is that there is no set-up whatsoever. It plays straight out of the box; so it's a perfect game if you only have 10 minutes to spare.

RATING: 10
Simply a perfect game. 

There are only a few rules which are very easy to explain to a new player. At the same time, the more you play, the more subtle strengths and potential mistakes which can hurt you in longer term you notice. Even though the game is simple, it's unlikely that a novice player will win with an experienced one.

There is no randomness whatsoever, so you are totally responsible for your decisions. However, each play is entirely different, even if you play many times with the same opponent. Probably it's because of insane number of possible openings. I don't think an average geek would (could?) memorize them, so it's a lot more fun when in a deterministic game like this you have to play intuitively.

Intuitive playing leads to another advantage, that is very quick pace of the game. Just compare it with chess, in which most players endlessly analyze the board for the best available option. It's definitely not like this. An entire play in Hive can be sometimes shorter than a single move in chess ;)

I also love the heavy bakelite tiles, which together with nice design makes them very satisfying to play with.

Finally! After years of pining for the OOP first and second editions I let slip through my fingers (more than once), along comes a new version that's even better.
Beautiful components, clear and concise rules, a neat and original idea, and a great sense of mounting tension as your queen bee gets cornered... Balancing your offense and defence is hard, and the game might be just a bit too thinky for casual gamers, but with evenly matched opponents, it's a hoot.

Every GenCon I try to get a game for each of my two daughters.  In 2008 I went in seeking Hive and Diche luft auf die gruft.  I was in the sellers hall as soon as the doors opened on the first day, and low and behold I found Hive at Troll and Toad's booth.  However, I'm one of these people that like to line up all of their ducks before making a move.  You know, I wanted to locate everything I wanted and THEN do all of my purchasing.  Three hours later I was back at Toad and Troll and....no Hive.  I couldn't believe it, and their very knowledgeable boardgame rep doubted they'd have any more in, BUT he said he'd do his best.  Friday, no Hive.  Saturday morning, no Hive.  Saturday afternoon, and there it was.  Hoooray.

This game has been an instant hit with my girls, especially my younger (10).  She's a nature girl, and where her older sister gravitates towards games with exploration and / or confrontation, she gravitates toward meditative, organizational games.  Hive absolutely scratches that itch.  It is a "chessy" game, but one that has ZERO set up time, won't last beyond 30 minutes, and has an odd "mancala" like feel to it.  Tactile and carefree.

Two player game with blocks of insects, each with unique movement and goal is to surround the opponent's queen. To invent such a game was a masterpiece! However, for strategic value, whoever goes first should win since they are one step ahead of their opponent, unless thay make a mistake. Maybe one way to balance it out is to play 2 games, and whoever surrounds the queen in the fewest number of moves is the winner. It's a shame the winner is usually decided by who goes first, since the game has a lot of potential with it's ideas.

Played digital clone Hanto and it was okay. I think you need a lot of plays to get into its beautfy, as with most abstracts, but learning is a bit annoying cause the movements are intuitive the,atically, just like Chess. The actual gameplay is just okay imo, nothing super gripping or thematically gripping.

RATING: 8
My head hurts, but I like it...One of my favourite abstracts. It's fast yet fairly deep and it is the perfect travel and beach game.

Too slow for what it is - a fairly luck-driven card game. I do like the deck-building aspect, moreso than MtG - and I certainly appreciate that there's not hundreds of different cards with variable powers and possible combinations to learn and remember thus alleviating the thing I disliked with Magic that you needed to dedicate yourself immensly to the game if you at all wanted to compete. Dominion is a good game, and certainly a good gateway game - yet it falls short of a great card game - there's not enough control to be a great strategy game and not enough luck to be a great push your luck card game.

The zenith of perfect information games. ...granted that chess had a few centuries head start for gaining popularity, but still Hive is superior: 500 years from now chess will be spoken of only in specialized history classes, whereas Hive will have become a mainstream form of collaborative logic, wherein both players receive gratefully the opportunity to learn, regardless of outcome.

RATING: 6
Good game but I struggle to get people to play this game and virtually no-one will play it a second time.  Having so many different pieces to choose from each turn can be a bit daunting for beginners.  I made a variant that gives you a hand of 3 tiles and that seems to work well. 

Pocket edition tile size is great, however I don't love all the different colours of the bugs.  The Carbon edition colours look much better.

I look forward to the Android version so I can at least play against an AI opponent.

Rating increased from 8 to 9 on further playing.  Could . . . go . . . all . . . the  . . . way!

On even further playing, a tendency to draws will hold this from a perfect rating, and even drops it back down a point.  And the a few more since I have no desire to get it back to the table.  Shame.

RATING: 3
[b]Components: 5/5[/b] It comes with a bag to carry your pieces in to make them more mobile, the tiles are some of the best and sturdiest board game pieces I've ever encountered, and the bug drawings are clear enough that even the color blind can differentiate between each of the bugs without a hassle.

[b]Theme: 4/5[/b] Bugs are an interesting theme. Not really tried out much beyond a few games here or there, so it's enjoyable to see something somewhat refreshing from the same old farming, trading, zombie, or train games.

This is where my positive scorings end.

[b]Strategy: 1/5[/b] Maybe there's more to this game than I'm seeing, but my god this game seems shallow. I've tried looking at strategic discussion for this game in a desperate attempt to catch my interest and prove to me that I didn't waste the money I spent buying this game... Every single time I look into the discussion the same very few "strategic moves" are talked about every time I look into this game. I've tried my best to like this game. An abstract? A unique theme? This should've been right up my alley. This game is touted as "chess with bugs", which is honestly an insult to chess. I'm not really huge into chess, but what's presented in that game is far more interesting than what I've seen presented as strategic movements in this game. I doubt I've really looked very deeply into hive, but to be honest, if I'm not gonna enjoy the game after the amount of time I've already put into it, then I don't care. It didn't take long for me to be somewhat interested in chess, go, yinsh, tzaar, onitama, arimaa, Kamisado... basically most abstracts ever made that I've seen are ones that I would totally love to have in my collection. But this game is just so... flat. It's flat. And that's surprising because it'd seem like games where all the peices move the same, like all of the previously mentioned games besides Onitama and chess, would be flat and void of a lot of strategy, but they put this game in the absolute dirt in terms of actually being interesting.

If I was constantly outplayed and beaten in this game, I would certainly be inclined to look a bit more into it, but the problem is I’ve won every game i’ve played. One might say I could play a hive tournament, get beaten, and then try to delve into the strategy following a humiliating defeat. Unfortunately, no other abstract I’ve ever played required that kind if hand holding to hook me, so I seriously don’t care.

So, even if there is strategy in this game, I'm still giving it a one rating, because the strategy presented isn't interesting to me in the slightest.

[i][COLOR=#33CCFF]Final thoughts:[/COLOR]  That's it. I have other things to complain about, like the fact that I never feel any sense of satisfaction after a victory. Or that the game always seems to devolve into the one hive rule on the queen, or that it always seems to be a race to throw a beetle on the other queen and then jump the beetle off as the last action. Real freaking riveting. This is seriously one of the most overrated games of all time.[/i]

A GREAT little game.  Very tactical, and not for everyone.  I think this game's heavy/light rating is incorrect on the geek, unless there is a tic-tac-toe problem of which I am unaware.  I'd play this over dungeon twister anytime, and DT is rated 100 ranks higher and .5 more difficult . . . ?  Has anyone played both games?

I love this game as a filler, and as something for those instances when you're late to the gaming event, and you and someone else is sitting around . . . .  This is a great game to get people thinking tactically!  A great teaching/learning tool.

This is in my top three two players (well, chess is number 1, but, you know . . . )

A very strange little game that everyone should try out.  I recommend playing the computer a few times to get a feel for the game, and then play someone who has done the same (if you can't find anyone who already knows how to play).

Like Mr. Jack I compare this to Chess.  Not only are you studying the board making every possible move in your head before deciding on your move, the rules are much like Chess.  I tell them the goal of the game 'capture the king' or 'surround the queen bee with any piece', and than I proceed to tell them how each different piece moves, JUST like in chess.

Very easily taught, and very hard to become a 'master', love this game.

I think I love this game.  Unfortunately, it seems abstract and opponents for these type games are hard to come by.  The pieces are fabulous.  I've played the online game many times and I suspect I will raise my rating after getting to play more human opponents.

Got to teach this to my 14 year old nephew, a budding game geek.  I think we both enjoyed it immensely.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I do not always want to play this game
+ It has a great price point for an abstract - just the right mix of variable moves that don't require severe brain burn to figure every move out.

Excellent components and even better gameplay. This one is a must have in any serious collection. An abstract that does not feel like one -- it, dare I say it, has a theme.

It will play well with kids, who are likely to enjoy the cool colorful pieces and insect powers, as well as serious game players. Unlike anything else out there, this superb game is well worth its price.

An intriguing semi-abstract which peels away to reveal different depths and strategies. A lovely feel to the pieces and a sophisticated look: much better than dealing with grotty chits and paper money all the time, especially when playing in public. Excellent repeatability value, which is a damn good job when a game finishes in a few minutes, but the fact that there are far more attacking strategies than defensive ones is a flaw that stops you playing more.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]When I first got into the hobby I almost picked up a copy of Hive, but then played some abstracts I really didn't care for and wrote off abstracts as a whole. Over the last year I've played quite a few abstracts I've enjoyed and Hive's been added to the list.

Game play is a breeze to learn, but as is typical with most abstracts, actually playing well is the challenge, there is so much depth packed into so few rules and components. I was engrossed during each game and really enjoyed how it made me think. Components are top notch and after seeing both the pocket and full size version I definitely prefer the smaller set. 

I also recently played Tatsu, by the same designer, and both games are now on my wishlist even though I don't know how often they will get played. Hive has earned it's reputation as a great intro into modern abstract games.[/i]

RATING: 10
The version I played was Hive Carbon, which has a stark black and white color scheme I find very attractive.  The hexagonal tiles are nice and solid, with somewhat stylized, yet fairly realistically-rendered images of insects etched on them.  This is an easy game to learn to play, but a difficult one to master, I would imagine.  Each type of insect moves in a unique way, and must be  employed both offensively and defensively in a constantly changing configuration.  Much more complex than it looks!  UPDATE: I got myself a copy of Hive Pocket.  I prefer playing with the full-sized version, but this dandy travel-sized version is significantly smaller and lighter, so just the thing for taking along when you travel. (5+5)

RATING: 6
Clever design, beautiful wooden pieces, and a pleasant theme cast over what is basically an abstract movement game. Simple rules and easy to get started with, yet retains an ever-changing unfolding of movement. Plays quickly, so, good with kids, although they might find its abstract nature a bit dry--depends on the kid's personality. My son Trevor, who was 10 years old in 2009, rated this a 6. 

One other plus is that it's portable: my son, Trevor (who was 10 in 2009 and rated this game a 6) and I played a game at a restaurant while waiting for our order to come out. Also, with the thick wooden pieces, it's a game that can be played outdoors, as the pieces won't get moved by winds. 

In sum, for my son and me, on the whole this game didn't grab us, I guess because there seems to be a fun factor that's missing. But for people more geared toward abstracts with really nice wooden pieces, this game may prove intriguing.

Traded, November 2010.

Not that easy to get quickly into the game, because one need to study the moves at first.
Got it explained at Essen 2010 and even after some days the people explaining it needed the manual to get through the moves.
That's mainly why I lost interest, 'though I mostly like that kind of 2-players abstracts.

Good game. Doesn't suit my gaming needs, though. I bought it so my wife and I could play it on the deck. After one game, we put it away and played dominoes instead. Hive needs a "luck" element (randomizer) to fill the only gaming niche I have available for it.

Overall what makes this game great is the simplicity of learning the moves of each bug. Therefore, young and very old can play. In fact I can play this with my 6 year old. Of course the strategy and depth of strategic thinking is what adds to the range and playability of this great game.

I do not see the complete depth of this game yet.  After a few plays with another inexperienced player I can see the potential and enjoy the game.  Needs more plays.

RATING: 8
What a fantastically clever concept. The different powers combine to offer differing paths each game. I like the shock moment in each game where suddenly you realise you're a turn behind somehow and you need to start playing some serious defence with blocking manoeuvres, working out how to regain the initiative. The game requires intensity, and I can see how it might stalemate between equally experienced players, but that's still a long way off and it's worth getting for the learning curve alone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Hive is a truly outstanding game.  It takes a matter of a few minutes to learn the basics of the game.  Because there is no board, only the attractive Bakelite pieces, the game can be played anywhere one can find a flat surface.  The strategy, however, is not so easily mastered.  I'm sure others have said it, but the game plays like a simpler version of chess and it does have that sort of feel to it.  The short playing time is an added bonus that makes playing a "best out of 3" (or 5? or 7?) series a great way to enjoy the game and try different strategies.

This is easily the best investment I've made in my small game collection so far.

If chess were combined with the mental feel of real wrestling, with insects, and with short gameplay, this might be the result. Great 2 player abstract game!! Brilliant!! Cute!! Challenging!! Short!! Portable!! Nice hefty pieces!! Can play basic or with expansions; both are cool. As long as this game is around, no one should ever play checkers again.

First of all the theme (yes, an abstract with a theme) works great! The grass hopper jumps, the beatles can climb on other insects etc. This makes the game enjoyable and very easy to teach. 

Fantastic portability. The carrying bag looks and feels great. The pieces are extremely durable and elegant and you don't have to worry about spilling water or food over them. I play it on the beach! A great coloreful experience for everyone playing or watching.

The gameplay itslef takes some getting used to. There are so much potential strategies to follow and steps to count, that can put off inexperienced players. I got bored and played whatever felt right, without any plan. For me though, playing without a plan is completly boring. In kahuna for example your plan may suck, but you always have one.

I personally think everyone should avoid the carbon edition as the colour adds to the fun and makes it easier for everyone to distinquish between the various insects (especially usefull when playing with casual gamers).

The pocket version can be usefull and is a lot cheaper as it also contains two expansions, but then you choose to miss the great feel of holding the original tiles in your hands, it is less impressive to look at and the pouch is ugly. (Though the tiles are also colourfull and elegant).

It's sth different. Freshen up your collection!

(Wife's Point of View: I thought that the cute looks of it and the simplicity of the rules will make it up for the strategy needed. Failed miserably. She likes the components, she won't play it again)

My favorite game for two and also my favorite pub/outdoors game. It is always in my car, ready to play.

Some people glaze over a bit at first. But through a patient "give and take" learning game, showing them how to effectively use the pieces, they usually really grow to like it. Only really negative reaction was from a closed-minded chess snob.

I've tried the "Blind Hive" variant (see variants) and found it very good!  A nice change to an already great game.

Using the "Blind Hive" variant is actually a good way to teach this game.  Two reasons-it forces experienced players into unfamiliar territory, leveling the playing field a bit. It also helps prevents new player AP. Flip it over, "This does what?" and then place it.  Helps reduce experienced player AP too. 

I've been playing new players like this: one game of blind hive to one game of regular. It is a really good mix.

I've played with the mosquito a few times, but it just does not feel the same. Instead of adding something, I think it detracts.

*Nostalgia-40th play outside at "Flicks on the Bricks", Portland Courthouse Square while waiting to watch Ghostbusters outside on the big screen July 08.

100th game 4/09.  After 100 plays, I feel like I am JUST starting to get this game. 

April 09-We were playing it on the dock when the Willamette River crashed a wake from a boat over on us. No impact to the game.

Any lesser game would have been instantly ruined.

One of the better chess substitutes out there.  Hive can be taught in 10 minutes or less but is much deeper than it first appears.    There are some minor issues, such as first player advantage and frequent draws.  The first player advantage is no worse than it is in chess, really, and can be mitigated with the addition of the pillbug expansion.  Using the tournament opening of not allowing queen openings lessens the draw frequency.   A major difference with chess, other than the lack of a board, is that pieces are added to the field instead of captured and removed.  Once a piece is added, it is permanently in the field of play.  So the game becomes more complex as you progress whereas chess often simplifies to an endgame.  Games between beginners seem to focus exclusively on a race to surround the queen.  But once some defensive tactics are learned, positional play becomes a focus and the game really starts to shine.  Games can prompt great post game discussion like chess does.  Hive is without question a modern classic.

This abstract game is a little like chess, except you have to decide whether to move a piece or bring another piece onto the table.  The game revolves around trying to "pin" your opponent's pieces and stop them from being able to react to you.  There are lots of hard decisions right from the start on whether you want to try to go after your opponent's queen, or thwart their efforts to go after yours.

We bought a copy in Essen. The box was damaged, but the game was perfect. 8 euros was not bad. :) It is the 3rd Edition with the bakelite pieces.  They are very tactile.

I like this game a great deal.  Mostly, due to the fact that I like a good abstract game, but love how tactile the game pieces are and how portable it is.  You do not need a game board and it is perfect to play while travelling.

This is a very intriguing game and I'm at a loss to explain why I don't like it more. 

Just gut reaction is that at some point it becomes reasonably obvious who will win and then the game goes on for several moves as the outcome inexorably plays out... Chess is like that too. Perhaps if a person played with house rules allowing one person to cede the game as is done in chess? As is, it feels like 10 minutes of a really fun abstract game that leads to a fairly clear winner - followed by 3 minutes of that winner slowly and methodically formalizing the win and sucking out all the fun built up in the first 10 minutes.

RATING: 7
This was a solid game - I genuinely enjoyed it. It's easy to learn, and quick to play. It's definitely another, 'I paid $20 for this?', game in terms of components. Nonetheless, it's quality 2-player filler when you aren't up for a game of Lost Cities as a 15-minute game.

I haven't seen the mosquito tile yet, but I'm sure I'll just make one before long. I fear this game suffers from a tad bit of first turn advantage, and after enough plays it might become 'solvable' and find itself on rails. Until then, though, it's quality.

RATING: 6
Lovely to look at, interesting to play, but strangely not as compelling as I want it to be.  The fatal flaws are both a tendency to endless looping as players jockey for a position, and the occasioanlly frustrating sense that what you're really trying to do is juggle too many piece positions in your head at once -- behaving like an air-traffic controller rather than someone playing a game.

Great thinky abstract. Always use the "it's like Chess but more fun" way of selling it. Take probably 1 game on average before a new player understands the movement rules, then after that it's all about discovery. The ability to slap solid bake-lite style pieces on any surface makes this an awesomely portable game as well.

I've probably played this more often than any other game this year and found a great little abstract. I can't think of another abstract I would rather haul out than this one. It's got enough depth that I haven't found any scripted plays but it's simple enough that even the longest games are over in under an hour. Most games are in the 20 to 30 minute range.

Great abstract game, which feels chess like without the extreme planning. The game will play in little time and the rules of movement are really simple. The fact that this particular edition includes the mosquito and the ladybug for the same nominal price make it the best way to get the game. Apparently some people have issues recognizing the black and white pieces but I fail to see why; neither my wife or I did have any issues there.

Best abstract I've played.  The game is quick (5-15 minutes) but makes you work mentally while still being fun- not work.  A real battle of wits and a blast to play.

Attractive & quick-playing game for 2 players where the pieces make the board as you go.

Given that I'm certainly no fan of chess, this is surprisingly enjoyable to play.

There is no luck involved and it can generate some of the same feelings as playing chess. However, there are much fewer options available so it doesn't strain the brain quite so much, and it can be played in a fraction of the time.

The pieces allow this to be played pretty much anywhere, although a smaller pocket-sized edition would be even better (with similar size pieces to something like Tantrix Pocket).

[floatleft][ImageID=1054772][/floatleft]Hive is an abstract strategy game reminiscent of [thing=171][/thing]. Both players have the same composition of pieces and each piece has a distinct ability. Players must work to surround the opposing players Queen Bee. However, unlike chess pieces are added into the game on a players turn and no pieces are ever captured.  Hive plays quickly and the rules are wonderfully succinct. The beautiful bakelite pieces make it easy to bring and play Hive anywhere. Compared to other abstracts, Hive is very good but I'm not certain it can stand up against games like [thing=188][/thing], [thing=2065][/thing] or even [thing=171][/thing] itself.

Hive is a fun game for two. A bit like chess in that both players have identical pieces with similar movement powers. There is no luck in the game because all information is in the open.

Plus I've beaten my girlfriend in every game we have played thus far - 4, I think - so I have a soft spot for the game

A much deeper strategy game than appears at first. 
While a short game - it has a lot to think about. Each of the different bugs has its own movement and advantages. You spend a lot of brain power in making good use of position and movement of the pieces. 
To me it is as challenging as chess.

The Bakelite version has great game pieces and make for an excellent looking game that attracts attention.

A game I played a ton of when I first learned about these things, as it got a lot of love in those "what should I play with my wife?" recommendation threads. I did play it with her quite a bit, but evidently I have improved faster than she has and she no longer enjoys playing against me. I get very few opportunities to play this now, but I hang on to it since it's short and I have some idea of one day teaching my children how to play this. 

I enjoy spatial games and abstract games, and this one strikes a nice balance between each of those. Envisioning board positions that don't exist yet is a hard challenge in a lot of abstract games (chess, for me, is impossible), but I can manage it in Hive. The game also feels dynamic because of the way the playing area morphs. It's a satisfying game in a lot of ways, with a reasonable amount of lookahead.

RATING: 10
Pros:
* Our most portable game. The pieces are indestructible and the bag can be tossed into a backpack or purse. We took this one to a resort in Cancun and played it underwater in the swimming pool.
* In addition to being our most portable game, it also has the fastest setup time. There's nothing to shuffle and no board to setup. Just go.

Cons:
* This may not belong in the Con category, but it's important to consider. This is a perfect information, zero-luck game (like Chess). The stronger player will always win. Unfortunately, it's not a fun game to play suboptimally and it's hard to find the right balance when creating a handicap.

Neutral:
* The Pillbug and Beetle both have degenerate strategies. Get used to having to neutralize both in every game.
* We used to leave the Lady Bug and Mosquito out of the game a lot. Much of the advanced strategy in the game seems to revolve around doing something that causes the other player to lose pace. This might be creating a hard to fill spot around your Queen. It might be making it hard for your opponent to put new pieces on the board where she most wants to. It may be trapping pieces. Between the Lady Bug, Beetle, and Grasshopper (and Mosquito when copying those movement abilities), it was too easy to fill in gaps and then board would always end up being a cluster of pieces in the middle. Thanks to the Pillbug, the board may start out as a cluster, but it's going to get odd shaped quickly.

== 2014-05-04 - R:8 -> 10

And now up to a 10. The Pillbug breathed new life into this game (and then some!). This one has earned its 10.

Incidentally, we now always play with the spider able to move 1, 2 or 3 spaces and we play with all pieces in the game (prior to the Pillbug, we used to leave the Mosquito and Lady Bug out a lot).

== 2012-10-07 - R:9.5 -> 8

Was surprised and saddened to get a little burned out on this one. In a perfect information, zero luck game, when you play with the same person every time, maybe it just starts feeling the same every time.

== Original - R:9.5

This is our perfect game. We take it everywhere and can play it anywhere. Hive has inspired a search for other games that are portable, have very low setup time, can be played on a relatively small table, and could survive being played on a less than perfectly clean/dry surface.

While we have both of the expansions (Ladybug and Mosquito), we found the increase in the number of pieces that could fill gaps made it so the shape of the board was no longer as important. The strategy degraded into a more simple race and the first player advantage became too strong. We now mostly play without the expansions or only allow one or the other (sometimes giving the player a choice at any time of which one to use).

We've also played around with a few variants.

Variant #1: Start with all of the pieces upside down. This adds a luck element which is sometimes fun. When playing this way, the beetle does NOT change the color of the piece it covers.

We find the spiders to be annoying. Players will slide the piece around to count the three moves and tend to knock the pieces around. We've played with a few ideas to change the spider.

Spider Variants:
  1. Spiders may move 1, 2 or 3 spaces (this is our default rule now).
  2. In place of his normal turn, a player's spider may "bite" an opponent's piece. When he does this, the piece is returned to the opponent's stockpile. It may be returned to the board following the normal game rules. A piece may not be removed if it would cause a violation of the one hive rule. If the removed piece is the queen, it must be returned to the board on the next turn (we don't know why anyone would remove the opponent's queen, but we didn't see any reason to disallow it yet). [UNTESTED]
  3. Any piece touching a spider (of either color) moves as if it were a queen (including pieces which normally couldn't move this way, e.g. grasshoppers and ladybugs). Beetles may not climb on top of the hive when touching a spider, but if they are already on top, they are unaffected. Mosquitoes touching a spider do not gain the powers of the spider.

When playing with the increased spider powers, we usually only allow one spider per player to offset the increase in power.

This is an enjoyable two player game.  The object seems simple enough encircle the queen using both yours and your opponants pieces.  Remember all the pieces except the grasshopper must be able to slide out or slide into position.  The grasshopper must jump in a straight line.  The beetle can climb on top of pieces and the ant can move the farthest.  The spider can only move three spaces.

The upside:
- How every abstract should be.
- It's engaging.
- The balance needed(?) between go for kill and defend your own queen.
- Quick and Portable.
- Quality of the pieces.

The downside:
- The less useful pieces are like that football player you hate but the manager always puts on the lineup.
- It's not appealing when you explain that you're trying to capture a queen be with insects.

One of the best abstracts I've played.  The love of this game can be infectious.  There's a lot of strategy in these short 15 minute games.  I love the way that the board is ever changing with each movement of a piece.  Makes the game feel alive.

RATING: 5
Enjoy the concept, don't like the dynamics. A very chessy game, where you struggle for position, using a range of different special-ability tiles. Sounds like fun, but for some reason it didn't grab me. You need two evenly matched players to get the full experience and sometimes the games tend to drag on (stalemates are quite possible).  

If you enjoy chess - try it, otherwise I would avoid.

It seems that similar patterns can start to occur quickly and that it is hard to help your queen escape. That may be a deficit on my part though. If that pattern remains the rating may drop.

Like dominoes, this is a tile laying game.  Like chess, it's all strategy.  The rules are simple with a slight learning curve.  It's a very nice abstract strategy game.

The game pieces are very nice quality.  Even if you don't like the game, you'll love the quality of the tiles.

It's easy to rave about this game, because it really is great.  Play a few games online first.  It's easy to get hooked.  But I do have a few complaints:

I don't like the mechanic of laying hex tiles free form.  The tiles move around too much.  It's not like dominoes where it's easy to keep the game space neat.  Drop a grasshopper in a hole, then try to get him out without messing up the board.  The photos all show nice and neat games being played, but in reality, it's not so neat.  This was my experience.  Free form game board.  Nice idea.  Using hex pieces to achieve this.  Not so good.

I purchased the Carbon Edition of the game because I thought it would be nice to have the extra expansion pieces.  I find it better to play the base game without the expansions.  So if you buy this game without the expansion, don't feel like you're missing something.

I found the Mosquito to be a terrible addition to the game.  Horrible concept.  The Lady Bug, however, is much better.  The movement of the Lady Bug should have been what the Spider is.  I always thought the Spider was a bit wonky.  The Spider is the hardest piece to plan movement because it's not so easy to count spaces around the outside of the board.  The Lady Bug movement is a much better idea.  That's my feelings.  This game should not have introduced expansions.  Instead, it should have revised the movement of the Spider to be like the Lady Bug and left the rest alone.

I played this game in two bursts.  When I first got it, I played it probably 15 times with my girlfriend of the time.  Then it sat there dormant until a friend was over and asked about it, and I played again for a few times.  In both cases, I really enjoyed the last few games we played, as the earlier easy paths to victory were being dealt with by my opponents and I was forced to get a bit more creative.

One thing I've noticed with both players is that they don't manage the potential of my queen moving very well at first, allowing me to lock pieces in by stringing them along.  They eventually learn to "trap *then* surround" and the games get much better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
What an elegant design! 22 pieces and an almost trivially-simple ruleset, nothing more -- not even a board. Games are quick yet interesting. I'm considering making a set out of cardboard hexes: it would be the smallest "travel" game in my collection, smaller even than a deck of cards. We're still learning strategy and tactics, but this is clearly a game that rewards study.

A fast, lightish abstract.  The key concept has been done before (better) in Chex, but Hive does have the benefit of being simpler.  It works OK, but lacks much drama, and has a fair number of stalemates.  I wonder how much the thin theme adds to other's enjoyment, as it seems to rate higher than many other quality abstract games?

Fun game.  Good travel/camping game.  If you leave it out in the rain, no issues!

Um jogo abstrato, rápido e de regras simples mas com boa dose de estratégia. Hive é jogado em 2 pessoas. O objetivo é cercar a abelha rainha da colméia adversária, para tal, cada participante pode utilizar seus insetos: gafanhotos, aranhas, besouros, formigas e a própria rainha. Como no xadrez, cada inseto se move de uma forma peculiar. Um jogo interessantissimo que não necessita de um tabuleiro para ser jogado.

Jogo muito interessante cujo nome está um pouco descontextuado, uma vez que nao me parece normal numa colmeia haver muitas formigas, escravelhos, aranhas, gafanhotos e apenas uma abelha...

BUY THIS GAME (NOW)
A truly EXCELLENT two player game.  If you are looking for a game you can learn in 5-10 minutes, play in 10-20 minutes, tickles the chess part of your brain, and is FUN - look no further.  Another game my 9YO son will beat me at 2 times out of 3 (or is that 3 times out of 4).  Just purchased Bakelite edition to go with my new bakelite Mosquitos [8-29-08]  Both versions are lovely.  I prefer the artwork on the foil on wood pieces.  But the bakelite just feels so NICE.  Bit of a toss-up really.  If you have the chance to purchase either copy you should.

Players: 2
Time: 10-20 min.

Each player has the same set of pieces: 1 queen bee, 2 spiders, 2 beetles, 3 ants, and 3 grasshoppers. Similar to pieces in chess, each piece moves differently and may be more useful at different stages of the game. To win, trap the other player's queen bee (similar to checkmating the king in chess). The rules are quite simple once you've learned how the different pieces move.

For me this suffered from the disadvantage of playing it after I had played Tile Chess. It looks and feels like Tile Chess but with a bug theme pasted on top. Okay, that last thing is a good as it makes the game much more accessible to players. The whole 'pieces make the board' is great though for early players it means the game tends towards draws as players make defensive rather than aggressive moves and gradually string the board out. This may be less of an issue if you have played a lot but it does worry me.

This deserves at least a 7 just for being a 2-player abstract that my wife likes and will play with me!

In fact, she's normally the one who asks to play - and of course I'll usually happily accept. While sometimes one of us wins quickly, most of the time the games go on for a while and can lead to really interesting endgame positions, where one of us (usually me) overlooks that what we thought was the winning move creates a key connection allowing a long-pinned piece to move. In fact, quite often in this game I get a winning position early on but mess up in this or similar fashion, and tend to end up with a hopeless game. But such situations make the game really quite interesting, and it isn't always just down to my stupidity :)

I should note that these comments were written a couple of years ago, it's now been quite a while since we played Hive or either of us asked to play it. Definitely a good game, but not one I've ever been very excited to play.

One of the newer abstract games that I enjoy. The low price point, portability, and easy teach and play time of this game make it a hit off the bat.

Couple that with a innovative design and the evolving tactics that one learns while playing the game and you can see why this game is one that you should at least try if you have another player who enjoys this type of game.

I give it rating of an 8, down a bit from my initial score of 9. Still, this is a great, fast and fun game to pull out almost anywhere due to its portability.

On the plus side - plays quickly and offers tactical depth and is portable.  On the negative side - there is a bit of a learning curve needing to know what patterns work and which don't.  Those last thoughts kept reminding me of chess wherein one must coordinate pieces and positions to make an attack while without weakening one's defense.  Therefore, like Chess, the game is probably appreciated with repeated play as patterns are learnt and applied.  A chess-like game without the chess-like time.

compact and thinky, this is a fun little filler abstract game. i used to compare it with chess, but i find this much more accessible. after a while it seems to be a bit of a race to get out your ants and pin down the other guy's ants. over time my rating has dropped just due to how little i play abstract fillers anymore. would the game be less forgettable without the ants, or just more slow and creeping? anyway, in the end, if i'm playing with someone who likes this game i'd probably rather be playing The Duke with them. i'll probably always keep a pocket set at work, even if i'd rather play my pocket set of Tak.

Abstracts are not usually my thing, [b]but this game is great[/b].  My wife and I play games in like 15 to 25 minutes, the pieces are tough (bakelite with colors edition) and we are definitely still exploring the depths of this.  For us the exploration of the game space is one of our favorite parts of the board game experience and we are definitely enjoying this.

So far I've played this game online only, at http://www.hivemania.com.  It's a very clever game.  To me this is in many ways like a lighter version of chess.  Lighter because it's quicker and less brain-burning.  Similar because of the special movement abilitites of the pieces, the way you have to plan ahead, and the way that you can put your opponent's queen in what is essentially a "check" or "checkmate" situation.  It is also similar to chess in that stalemates are definitely possible, especially if players are evenly matched.  So I would say if you enjoy chess but want something lighter and quicker, this is an excellent choice.  If you really, really hate chess, then I can't imagine you enjoying this game for very long.

RATING: 8
Wonderful hefty clacky bakelite pieces and a neat tactical game that rewards replay.  Plays quick enough that we sometimes use it to decide who has to wash the dishes.

Unfortunately as players gain experience, the game often leads to a tie result. But then the tournament rule appeared: you can't play the queen as your first move. This greatly solves the frequent tie problem! Play with it.

Of the expansions, I like Mosquito best.

I created the [[Hive FAQ]] wiki page.

RATING: 8.5
This is a great concept. It's a board game without the board. I've heard it called "insect chess" before, and that's a pretty good analogy. If I have a minor complaint at all, it's that going first and working with one or two specific strategies tend to work so well as to dominate the game. However, that could just be a weakness of the inexperienced players, not the game itself. :)

500+ plays. Broken - draws can be forced by either player. Although similar arguments could be made for games like chess, the depth of chess ensures that few player will ever reach such a level of play. Hive is shallow enough that a player can easily master this game after several plays, after which the game becomes an exercise in playing to draw.

New queen placement rule has *not* solved this issue among competent players.

Hive is a surprisingly deep strategy game. Surprisingly, since the rules are really simple, and easy to be picked up by players of any level. The often quoted "bakelite-goodness" of the tiles, which come in easy-on-the hand, heavy, polymer hexagonal discs, give this game a special feel that lifts it above other products in the burgeoning market of strategy boardgames. And, of course, the animals are pretty insects, allowing players to treat these insects as strategic assets rather than pests.
(I'm not kidding, I LOVE these insects, one of the few games that allows kids to get closely acquainted with insects, and nip arachnophobia in the bud right away - hmm, then again, those spiders ARE the weakest pawns.... ;-)

I can imagine that this game is perfect for playing at the beach or on other unsuitable places for boardgames. Moreover I guess this game has a lot of strategic potential. My first game couldn't convince me, though.

EDIT: I tried the game again and ... ka-ching! ... my eyes were open: this is an absolutely awesome game! Abstract and non-abstract together and really challenging. I'm looking forward to playing with the small expansion tiles like "The Pillbug, "The Mosquito" and "The Ladybug".

EDIT 2: Now that I played the game with all its mini expansions I don't wanna play it without them anymore. They make the game better in my honest opinion.

RATING: 6
Fascinating game, great components, but ends in a stalemate about 75% of the time that I play it (regardless of strategy, opponent, etc).

If I can find a way around the stalemate thing, I think Hive would be more of an 8 for me. If not it's a 4 or 5, or even a 1 (broken). But I want to love it... help me out.

Update: Well, I couldn't resist the bakelite pieces, so I bought a copy. The manual thanks Jesus, which doesn't bode well on the not broken front. "Don't thank me mate, I rated your game a 3."

Update II (Electric Boogaloo): After some more play it doesn't seem to be broken. But sadly, it doesn't seem to have been playtested much either... it's very scripted and static compared to any of the Gipf games. Glad I bought it though, because the lack of board and the indestructible pieces make it very suitable as a pub / cafe / travel game.

I've had games that ran into 5 minute blowouts to 45 minute, brain burning, chess matches. I can't recommend this game enough if you like abstracts!

I like the game quite a bit, though I still don't feel like I've got a good handle on the finishing strategy.

Still, it's quite unique, travels very well, and the bakelite pieces are absolute bliss to handle.

I don't know what it is, but there is something about this game that reminds me of chess and, for me, that isn't a good thing.  Maybe it's because I don't get it, but I don't take a lot of enjoyment out of playing it.  I'm not a big fan of abstracts and this is just another example of why.

Hive is one of those games that is genius in it's simplicity of design. Get a few hex blocks. Make up a few pieces that, similarly to chess, have easy to remember but unique movement rules. Set a goal of capturing the queen. 
Similarly to chess it falls into the "easy to learn, tough to master" category, and serious kudos to the designer for this one.

[46 plays] There are strategies yet to be uncovered and tons of tactical options for me yet to discover here.

I can definitely see what people love about this game: no set-up, plenty of tough tactical choices and rapid fire games. For many, this may be perfect 2 player filler while you're waiting for people to show up and get organized.

Update 2012: I've been playing a lot of this with my 5 year old, and I'm surprised by both how well it does as kid's game and by how quickly he sees the moves and clever opportunities. Fun stuff!

We now always include the Mosquito and Ladybug.

Good tight tactical game. Yes it smacks of chess (Is it just me or is the spider like a knight?). However, poor placement allows savvier opponents to totally lock out your strong pieces. And you need to spend a turn or three trying to remove pieces of your hive. Fun but flawed.

The only “chesslike” abstract strategy game that we own, and likely the only one that we will ever need. The perfect balance of easy to learn, hard to master, while still being satisfying to play. We love that it is in the sweet spot somewhere in the middle between chess and checkers. You don’t have to be a genius savant to play it, but the better player will almost always win. Not having a board makes it super portable as well, which is a huge plus.

This is the best Abstract I have played.  I was a real fan of chess but the recognizable pieces, no need for a board and the fact my 5 year old understands the rules and can play with a degree of skill makes this a favorite that is not losing its appeal but gaining more depth with each play.  Plus it plays so quickly it scratches the itch to play a game even if time constrained.

RATING: 9
An engrossing little abstract game.  Indeed, it feels like a more manageable chess, with the exception that the powerful pieces (the ants and spiders) come out first, while the weaker pieces (the grasshoppers and beetles) become excruciatingly important in the endgame (although I don&#039;t claim to be an expert).  This &quot;slowing down&quot; of the game tends to provide quite a bit of tension (which IMO is lacking in the chess endgame).  Hive looks great, too, although bad lighting or greasy fingers can ruin the iridescent effect.

Abstract, Tile-laying. After 2 plays, really enjoy this light abstract. I think there will be a lot of fun discovering the depth of play here; the wife likes it well enough that I ought to get a few plays in now and then.

EDIT: I've played a few more times. My wife and I still like it and have introduced some other people to it. Really fun abstract game (that still feels thematic to me) that can heat up the brain but doesn't actually feel like a brain burner.

I've played Hive both online against the computer and against live players (in person). It has been compared to Chess, in that different pieces have unique ways of moving, etc. But it does not "feel" at all like Chess to me. I don't particularly care for Chess, but I enjoy Hive. The insect theme is a winner for me, as is the way that placement of various insects "creates" the playing field. It's a mechanic I really dig, and meshes well with both the theme and the other mechanics of the game. Unfortunately, repeated plays have seen the endgame bog down into a dance (not unlike the dance of a honey bee sharing news of a nectar discovery with its hive-mates) of positioning which causes the game to drag on and on.

The 3 games we played broke down into a paralysis battle, with players focusing on denying any moves to the other.  The game became more about being annoying than about winning.  Even after further reflection, it&#039;s difficult to see how to avoid this problem.

It's a sometime obsession.  You can play it for free at http://www.hivemania.com/vgame or http://www.boardspace.net  It's sort of a cross between chess and tic-tac-toe with a bug puzzle hex theme.  I say tic-tac-toe because you can lose, I mean play, the game really fast.  It's an interesting time killer, but the computer AI at www.hivemania.com seems almost impossible to beat in the beginning.  It seems a lot harder than Blokus, but it's also a lot faster.  Compared to chess, I think players are more often of similar skill for a game like hive.  I've never played it except on the computer.  However, I think it might be somewhat confusing to remember what pieces can't move in certain locations without computer guidance.

Rating after 3 plays. I quite like it - it's probably a bit too chess-like for me and I can see myself being fairly bad at it which makes it less fun.

It's quite "thinky" and a lot more strategic than it looks. Also quick and not too complicated since there's only a few pieces to learn how to move. Plus Michael liked it.

Nagyon erős absztrakt játék két személynek. Olyannyira erős, hogy sakkhoz is hasonlítják nem véletlenül. Nekem ez már annyira absztrakt és száraz, hogy nem is nevezném játéknak. Ahogyan a sakk is, számomra ez sem játékkategória már. Nem az a játék, amire azt mondom, hogy kikapcsol és szórakoztat. Itt keményen kell gondolkodni és erőltetni az agyat. A pontszám sokkal nagyobb lenne részemről, ha magát az ötletet és a megvalósítást értékelném, de mivel a szórakozás, kikapcsolódás is része a játéknak, így nem tudok ennél jó szívvel több pontot adni.
A játék kivitelezése tökéletes, gyönyörűek a kövek, fantasztikus, hogy utazó szütyő is jár a játékhoz a dobozban, amivel könnyedén lehet vinni hosszabb utakra is. Profi!

a chess like game for 2.

Cons: Probably that its a bit like a 3d chess game - certain pieces can make certain moves only and its about surrounding the queen bee. I think its a fantastic game I'm just not too big on chess style games as I find them a bit restricting.

Pros: get the bakalite version! very cute and solid. Good fast move focused strategy. Great for chess lovers.

What a surprisingly great abstract game.   It even somewhat feels like what it is supposed to be (bugs in a cluster.

Suffers for stiff competition in the two-player perfect-information abstract category. There's a lot going on and a lot to learn.

I don't play this as often as I initially thought that I would, perhaps because I don't tend to carry games around with me.  This is a good small abstract, with a good bit of merit, but it seems that when I want to play a two-player game, I'm looking for something lighter, or something heavier, and this seems to fall into a little limbo in the middle.

Why is everybody so rough with the pieces? Every player I introduce Hive to feels the need to grab a tile and drop it from several inches onto the table - stop that!

a very accessible abstract game with similarities to both Chess and Go. 

yayay - this is fun. it’s like Go but much more manageable! i love the tension of the endgame. because there is no board, the game can take many different (unexpected!) directions.

I'd wanted to try Hive for some time before I finally played it, and then I played it several times against a few different opponents. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did, nor was I expecting it to see as much table time in such a short time. I especially like the decisions between unit deployment and positioning, the wisdom of which are not at all obvious. Unlike abstracts with fixed setups, games begin (and not just end) differently. It may not be the deepest abstract around, but it's quick, satisfying, and popular with diverse groups of people. The durable pieces make it a great pub game.

It's an abstract using hexes labeled with various bugs. On your turn, you either add a piece to the play area (must be adjacent to one of your pieces but not touching opponent) or move a piece. The goal is to completely surround your opponent's queen. Each piece moves in different ways (grasshoppers jump in a line, ants crawl along edges any distance, spiders crawl along edges up to 3 spaces, beetle moves to 1 adjacent space and can climb on top of other pieces, queen moves 1 space).

Moquito, Ladybug, and Pillbug - I love Hive.  I love its portability and unique game play.  The Ladybug expansion added a lot to this game.  When you have two experienced players who know when to play offensive and when to play defensive its a blast.  New players tend to think offensively only.

Just purchased at B&N after a 30% discount coupled with an additional 15% off coupon.  I've been eying this for a while now, but I convinced myself I'd rather buy the carbon version.  The cheap B&N price sort of won out in the end, I guess.  I'm not much of an abstract game fan, so I hope I can get some use out of this.

June, 2012 - Finally got to play a few games with my gaming buddies.  None of us were particularly "wowed" by it, but that's most likely due to our lack of understanding the tactics involved.

RATING: 9
Very challenging and entertaining game that's never gonna bore you. One match will take you 10 to 30 minutes and you can play it on almost any. The look and feel of the material is just great - the bakelite stones are nearly indestructible: one fell off our balcony and right onto the concrete stairs some five meters below and you couldn't make out a scratch.

This game hates me. I appreciate it, and the quality of the pieces is excellent. But, boy, am I terrible at it! I could be convinced to try again, but I have yet to win against anyone in this game. I was beaten by my very bright six year old niece, who told me after that it was okay because she had played it a lot more than me. Something tells me that no matter how often I played this, she would win. A testament to her, and to my inability to get games like this. Because I appreciate this game, I give it a 6. But on a personal level, it's more like a 3.

One of the best games I own.  Can be a fast trip to brain-burn land, but don't worry you wont stay there long; each game lasts 1/2 hour at the very most.  Looks great and plays like a well-trimmed abstract should.

Update:
I'm lowering my rating from 9 to 8.  After a number of plays, it's still good, but God help you if you fall behind.  Any comeback seems near impossible, especially with a good opponent.  Makes the experience a bit frustrating.    

Update:
Who was I fooling?  This game is genius.  My rating goes back to a solid 9.   If you fall behind, be patient, young padawan.  The way back is hidden, but it does exist!

OMG! This is a game that I dismissed earlier, because it seemed to be too abstract for my taste. Boy, am I glad I gave it a second glance. It's abstract, yes, but somehow, after it grows on you, you almost feel you are actually controlling an orchestra of bugs and insects and it suddenly seems much more thematic. The game is simple. The rules are simple. The challenge and fun are incredible. It's fast paced and a constant enjoyment. The "one more go" syndrome is unsurmountable. This is so addictive. Since the components are great and resistant, you can take the game anywhere. The beach provides an adequate setting! I can see myself playing this over and over again, for a long time.

It's a very quick abstract. Played with the Mosquito but don't have the other expansions. It's pretty thinky and the theme of the pieces is there just enough that the pieces movement makes sense. If it was either a deeper game or a more thematic it would probably be my second favorite game. Also, I would love to see a 3 and 4 player version of it. I like it much better than Chess because even though it is tactical, it has a larger appeal and plays much faster.

Whether it's fair or not, I'm going to compare this game to "Hey! That's my fish!" (henceforth referred to as HtmF), because my main reason for picking up Hive was the truly shocking degree of fun I've had with HtmF.  And while I was impressed with the game of "Hive" over-all, it didn't quite hit the same sweet spot as HtmF (and it's not just because I have an extreme aversion to insects in general!).  That's not to say it isn't a fun game and doesn't have a lot going for it (such as it's portability and indestructability), because it is and it does.  In fact, one thing that I loved about it was the fact that my wife (who is generally less strategically-minded than myself) cleaned my clock the first few times we played this.  I do love a challenge, and I also love a simple, strategic, lovely-looking game, which is exactly what Hive is.  And best of all, you can play this game on a table at a pub without worrying about the slimy, spilled beer stickiness ruining the components.  Game design: 5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 8/10

Interesting but limited tile-laying abstract game. Each player has as an equal number of tiles depicting various different arthropods and each of these can move in different ways e.g. the beetle can be placed on top of other tiles, the grasshopper can jump over other tiles, the soldier ant can be placed anywhere on the outside of the 'hive' (the group of tiles). The object is to completely surround your opponent's queen bee so that it cannot move. The variety brought to the game by the way the tiles move and the tactical decisions that brings is a definite plus point, but overall the game begins to feel repetitive all too quickly on account of the single object goal.

The first twenty or so plays are a 9, but I see myself falling into the same patterns after a while. Hive seemed like it was going to be a deep abstract, but it's more of a filler.

There isn't "one strategy that wins all the time," but the decision tree is small and easily searchable.

RATING: 8
Played this with my son (just recently turned age 6), but rated this as an adult game. It is that good. Would rate it a 9.5 as a kids game: no text involved (great for my kid as he can't yet read), simple rules (just 4 small pages), playing pieces that can withstand falling off the table and ultra portable if you put the playing pieces + small rules in a chits-bag.

If it wasn't for some 'difficult' to explain rules (no movement of other pieces during moves, no placing in or out a surrounded spot) I would rate this a perfect 10 as a kids game.

Stimulates thinking ahead, thinking creatively and the bug-theme even supports the game play.

Great small game. Definitely recommended.

RATING: 8
Hive is a short, simple, and interesting game. I love the little details and strategies--when to place which insect, when to introduce the queen. The component tiles are well manufactured, though I had to clean some white residue off the black pieces that built up as they had been stored under the white pieces for quite some time in the box.

My sister and I quite enjoy the game and can squeeze two or three games in a half hour space of free time. I can't wait to teach my friends back at college. This is a fantastic game for people on the go with a hankering for strategy.

A truly fantastic little abstract-thinker. The pieces are hefty and awesome looking, and it's an easy game to learn  but very tough to master. A definite keeper and cannot wait to play it again! 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
At first it feels like a parody of chess. The idea that the pieces are the board is simply brilliant. And the flavor is well thought: it totally makes sense that an hexagon game is about a hive, plus the pieces' movement is very appropriate.
The carbon edition is beautiful in all aspects. Pretty solid materials, plus a comfy travel pouch so that you can play the game wherever you like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The more I play this, the more I appreciate the nuances of the game. What feels like a chaotic game initially soon turns into deep strategy and look-ahead. Pro-players, which I am not, have developed a whole vocabulary around the game, including opening moves etc.

Hive, more than any other game I have tried, has the potential to still be around in 100 years. It feels like Chess, except I am around when it was created.

Are you a casual chess player? Do you like abstract strategy games? If either of those apply to you, then you'll probably find Hive an interesting and enjoyable game.

I really enjoy 2 player abstracts.

---

I've had that sad comment above for over a year now. Hive is a really enjoyable abstract with strategies that run pretty deep. There is a reason this game frequently gets compared to chess. In fact it is so similar to chess that it has become difficult to find someone to play this with.
I am by no means a hive expert. But the last time I played a serious round of games with my brother I won 10 out of 13 games. We haven't played since. And my wife bought me a hive t-shirt to make up for not playing it with me anymore.
Like chess, the game is almost too great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's fun.  I was addicted at first, but the novelty has kind of worn off a bit.  I like to take it on trips since the rules are simple enough to teach my friends/family and it's extremely portable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
tl;dr: it's a 2 player abstract!

That's more or less my review: Both players have an identical set of pieces that have to be played tactically to archive the victory condition. You know, a 2 player abstract! I've never been fond of those kinds of games, and this game did nothing to change my mind.
I guess it's well designed, and there are a couple of opportunities for smart moves and such, but this left me cold.

In summary a quick fun abstract for two, payable almost anywhere.

I have played it couple of times. I had a lot of fun, the game is both challenging and quick which i understand as virtues for this kind of games. Excellent introduction to gaming for young person. For the older gamers the problem with this branch of games is always the same: we play the rules, the rest is just decoration. It is "the game" per se. Nothing more, so it will become more and more "empty" and disappointing as we better understand and see where are the borders of its rules (which are simultaneously the borders of game, since it offers nothing to imagination). But the idea, the rules are still well designed. One of the best games i have played and would be willing to play it once again if i had an occasion.

This is a cute little two player strategy game where you are trying to capture the opponent's queen bee. Simple to learn, highly portable (comes in a pouch), and only requires a flat surface to play.  This game is similar to  chess in that all the pieces have unique ways of moving, requiring multiple levels of planning in advance to ultimately capture the enemy queen by completely surrounding it with your hexagonal creepy crawlies.

I can't see a flaw to not be a perfect 10. Chess for the new millenium. A classic. kudos to the developer for balance, depth and originality.

The Carbon set actually improves aesthetic of game, by going with classy B&W instead of the rather garish, little kid's game coloured tiles.

Both Mosquito and Ladybug fit nicely and for me are just part of Hive now, not to be played with expansions included.

UPDATE 11/05/2011

Have played a lot lately and have dropped my rating by 2. Once you get behind in terms of Queen being surrounded, you are almost always doomed, since no way to free a queen under a bettle, or surrounded on three sides.

That means often you finish games knowing outcome.

This game reminds me of chess. I don't want to say "better" exactly, but maybe "more fun" as it's faster (assuming you're not playing speed chess), the pieces are a bit more interesting, and I love how it doesn't have a board and can be played anywhere.

There are some general strategies that should generally be kept in mind to be successful and, once you realize this, it kind of brings the game down a half notch or so. This changed me from a 'love this game' to a 'really, really like this game'.

But I still want to play it all the time...for now.

Solid 7. Really loved this game the first few sessions. After playing online and reading some strategy, not quite as excited (hint: figure the game out for yourself with other players -- much more fun that way).

If you love bugs, this game is fun.

If you love tactical games, this game is great.

If you love chess, this is a nice 'quickie' game with a chess-like feel if you play with someone that understands the game at the same level as you.

Much less AP than chess, the best 2 player abstract I can think of with a nice theme.  Unfortunately I am not a fan of abstracts.  I had fun exploring the game while it was new to me, but I feel like I've gotten to a point where I have to start taking the game too seriously (studying openings and such), and don't want to play anymore.

The BEST part of the game are the components and the colorful graphic design.

I love Hive! It's such a simple and elegant two-player design. (I don't even mind the spiders as much as I thought I would!) What I've noticed in my plays against my husband is that one of us will tend to win a block of games with one strategy until the other figures out a strategy to beat it, so it makes for a really addictive challenge. It's quite a victorious feeling when you finally "break" the other player's strategy. The other awesome advantage to Hive is that it is extremely quick and portable--you can play it nearly anywhere. The quality of the pieces is exceptional, as well. Overall, a very lovely game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I guess I can see the appeal - Hive has cool bits, is quick and portable - but this is no more fun to me than most other highly touted abstracts like Chess, YINSH or DVONN. I'm not a big fan of abstracts (save for a few superior and accessible titles like Ingenious, Go, Qwirkle and Medina) to begin with, however, so keep that personal preference in mind when assessing my rating. If you love bone-dry game mechanics, then Hive may very well appeal more to you than it did to me.

Hive is an abstract two player strategy game with the theme and mechanics centered off of a insect hive. Each piece has a particular move like in chess, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. I really enjoy that the game is made of heavy duty domino like tiles that are thick and robust. The game comes in a portable bag to play on the go and can be played almost anywhere you have a flat surface. I prefer the color pieces to the Carbon version which drabs out the game. The game is easy to learn, difficult to master against a skilled opponent. Games can be short but with the right opponent can become drawn out to about 30 minutes at most in my experience. The game can be downloaded off of Steam which the AI provides a skilled player with a challenge, sometimes a brutal undertaking. Hive will remain in my collection definitely.

RATING: 8
I like it! Simple and beautiful components, easy rules, all kind of different strategies possible.

I like the fact that each insect (and the spider, which technically isn't an insect) has its own rules, which gives it a chess-like feel, and how you have to use all these different abilities to get closer to the enemy queen and corner her.

I have only played this hex tile game in the computer version and not face-to-face yet. Very interesting 2-player game involving moving different kinds of insects using their limited movement capabilities to try to completely surround the other player's bee. Plays in 10-20 minutes.

Hive is an intense head-to-head game not unlike Chess.  Unfortunately, I don't like Chess.  I keep waiting for a cross-country train ride where I can whip it out and fall in love with it, or something like that.

Wonderful two player chess like game.  Quick, easy to teach and fun.  I have both the Bakelite and wooden versions and the components in both are top notch. 

I almost prefer the wooden version.

After playing about 100 games on hivemania.com I think I am going to upgrade this one to an 8.5

Win or lose I enjoy this one very much.

Played online until I could beat the AI. Enjoyed it although I hate abstracts. Probably because it is quick and also easy to learn. Got it as a present, played against my partner. It was more fun for me than for her because I had a great advantage due to my online training. But I could observe that she quickly improved her moves.

RATING: 8
Great game. But as it has no luck element it is very tight and one mistake may cost you the game. And owning it means hearing a lot of "you own it, you must play it a lot, I have no chance of winning" and that gets annoying.
Not for everyone, but if you want tactical with no luck involved, you can't go wrong with this one.

I waited for a long time before purchasing Hive. My wife and I love a solid two-player game. But neither of us love abstracts. After considering Hive for several months. I bought it before we took off for an anniversary vacation to Greece. We played it a few times and we could both see why it's enjoyed by many. But it wasn't really our cup of tea.

The game is probably best described as Chess Lite. It's incredibly tactical, and once players are good at it, it becomes an exercise in mind reading, and counter play to infinite consideration. Like I said, awesome for some, not so much for me and my wife. I rate it a 6 after three plays.

Still trying to figure out this two player abstract, as most of my first 25 plays have been teaching games.  I will hopefully get to play some more balanced games so I can better see what this is all about.

I'm curious as to how elusive the queen can actually be(e) and how early one can predict one's downfall/victory.

I have the bakelite version with the zipper carrying case.  The great components sure add to the allure of the game.

After just two plays, I can see how this would be THE strategic filler for two people.  Manages to cram a lot of strategy into such few rules/pieces/time!  It's like the bake lite equivalent of Battle Line (and plays shorter) for me and fills a nice niche.

RATING: 7
Neat little near-abstract with room for creativity and depth.... It's not as deep as some other abstracts I prefer, though. It's more chess-like than go-like, in the sense that moves are more likely to be 'lots' better than other ones, and that missing a particular rejoinder is more likely to cost you; whereas Go is (mostly) a subtle build-up of long-term advantage.

I've heard Hive compared to chess... Which I don't really get.  Sure, there are pieces with simple movement rules and there is no luck.  But This game doesn't click with me.  It's just too dry and abstract.  And it's one of those games that you have to invest time in to getting good at.  I just can't imagine wanting to play this more than a couple of times and certainly not long enough to get proficient at.

Quick, simple, but surprisely deep, few tiles but many strategies inside, great replayability, you can play it seriously (brainburning) or very quickly (both ways are fun!), bugs with lovely looking, my girlfriend hates traditional abstracts (chess, go..) but loves this... all of this make it my favourite abstract by far. White encourages aggresive playing during open-mid play, black defending, but each game is so quick that you can play 3-4 games (changing colors) in the same time you play one chess game...I'd never thought an abstract could be so enjoyable!

RATING: 6.5
A fresh, imaginative, solid stab at a reasonably quick, reasonably deep, no-luck abstract game without a board.

However, Hive also exhibits some of the problems inherent in the form, with the first player advantage being a bit too strong and the game being a bit too prone to repetitive move stalemates among experienced players.

Worth exploring, though.  The chunky pieces are much better than the pasted on foil ones that were difficult to see in poor light.

EN: This is really fresh, with nice theme, logic game. Probably it will become boring for me some day but for now it is perfect logic game. Obviously It's not classic game like chess or go.

Moving the chunky bakelite pieces around is perfect for this addictive abstract strategy game. Each type of piece moves in a different way much like chess. Each time I play I discover new combinations of movement that reveal new strategies.

RATING: 10
Cool little abstract game.
Plays 2 players, in a chess like battle with bugs.

I have played over 20 games with 3 different opponents and every game is different.  The original peices make for a tight tactical battle, while the addition of mosquito and ladybug give you extra power moves.  (once you play with the expanded pieces you cant go back). 

Great production value, nice art work, and a perfect portable game bag.

This is an outstanding game! Hive's ability to merge an abstract game concept with a natural phenomenon (bugs crawling around) deserves mentioning. Normally, I am not one to go around craving abstract games, but Hive's simplicity coupled with the logic of the moving pieces mimicking bug movements in real life is a winner. This  game is simple to teach yet is astoundingly complex in its movement variability. I enjoy the small and compact pieces and also the challenge of the game itself (perhaps because I suck at this game makes me want to play it even more).

Excellent game that really fills the collection niche of a short, thoughtful game of skill. It can even be taught quickly - I've shown the game to some rather rowdy 15-year-olds and they jump right into it, if not with the best strategy in the world. There's not as much strategic depth here as the classic abstracts (Chess, Go, etc.), but there's definitely enough to keep you playing it for a long time.

Update: Dropping this to a 7, only because I don't seem to have a burning desire to bring it out lately, which is typical for me with abstracts other than Go. Fine game, though...

Fun abstract, chess-like but shorter than chess.  My problem is the lack of randomness - there's a minor amount of randomness in the uncertainty whether my opponent will add a tile or move a tile, so it's not totally void of chance.  Still, I prefer games with more chance, or at least when I'm as terrible at them as I am at Hive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initially interesting abstract that quickly devolves into samey-ness and tic-tac-toe tedium. Huge first player advantage...

Place an ant, move it around adjacent to your opponent's queen, place another bug beside it, move it adjacent to your opponent's queen, wash, rinse, and repeat until the queen is surrounded. Unless your opponent went first, in which case he'll probably surround your queen first. Yawn.

This game reminds me of a combination of checkers and chess.  It's simple enough that my 9 year old can grasp it and complex enough with strategies and "gotchas!" that I can see it hitting the table in the future.  

The time factor also helps in that there's no set up and you can play a complete game in very little time.  In other words, I may be able to bring this to work to play over lunch and get a few games in against co-workers.

I played this against my 60+ year old father and he took a liking to it.  He even found that you can play it on-line.  He's a good chess player so I can only assume that THAT interest sparked his interest in this game.

RATING: 6
Interesting tactical battle.  Games tend to be short so the second player has a serious temp disadvantage.  Player 2 most defend from the get go and try and engineer a situation where they can move their queen out of lock to reverse initiative.

I think I would enjoy this game more if it wasn't so heavily defensive.  Still a very good game.

RATING: 8.5
Pros: highly tactical, no luck, near-perfect information, easy to learn but hard to master, substantial theme for an abstract game

Cons: steeper learning curve to attain victory, can be played to stalemate, can outstay its welcome, possibly unbalanced in favor of the player going first

I'm terrible at abstract strategy, but I'm a glutton for punishment so I still play this--my abstract of choice. Good fun, elegant design, and tons of depth! Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this as compared to other abstract strategy games is the geometry of the "hive" you're building and the "freedom to move" rule that is so beautifully elegant. That and that you get to choose which pieces you put into play makes for meaningful decision-making that dictates your strategy, as well as a significantly different game experience each time.

Plays listed may include the Ladybug and Mosquito expansions. I have not tried others. Besides online play, I've mostly played Hive Carbon and Hive Pocket implementations.

This is a nearly perfect game and a refreshingly new system after playing lots of wargames and euros. But after plenty of face-to-face games and a few online, many of my games are ending in a draw, falling into a loop of repeated plays between me and my opponent. I guess that's the one downside of a purely skill-based movement game like this. However, it's amazingly designed, easy to teach, and wonderfully addictive.

Saying it's "Chess in 20 minutes" may turn some people away but they shouldn't be fearful.  The comparison is simply that the game pieces have chess-like diversity of movement rules  and playing has chess-like choices of movement options.  All giving satisfaction in the ensuing battle, regardless  of whether or  someone already has a favorable feeling toward chess.

Running an afterschool program for strategy games, I find 7th and 8th graders  who absolutely devour the game several times in quick succession .. and almost all of them can readily beat me.

What a wonderful game! Portable, easy to teach, gorgeous peices, and extremely strategic. Simple rules-complex play: the holy grail of game design! After years and years of playing Go-- and then in a fit of rationality ;-) swearing off all abstracts, I am back to them all because of this great game. Hive is just irresistable. The reason my rank isn't a 10 is simply because I haven't yet played enough to be convinced that the depth is there for years of enjoyment. Given how keen I am to play this every minute of the day, I'll have my answer soon enough though. **The game box comes with a sweet little carrying case to make this extremely portable. Yay!

Oct 2017:
When I first started looking into games (before I realized just how many are out there), I was looking for 2P games for my fiancee and I to enjoy to spend less time staring at screens when there's nothing to do outside.  This was one of the first games I picked up, as it was listed on nearly every blog/article on the topic of 2 player games.

However, it has ended up rarely being played.  It's fun, for what it is, and can end up just as competitive as chess if you both master the game.  But...we have so many other games that are more appealing this one just doesn't come out much.  It's a fun one to take to the park, in the car/plane, etc.  It's suitable for all ages, but it's not as much of a gateway game because it can be hard for new players to remember what each bug does - they'll need to consult the rules a lot which sometimes makes them frustrated.  I'd highly recommend this for anyone looking to entertain their kids on trips or for a small game to pack in a bag for traveling, but otherwise it sits on the shelf rarely getting used.

Original:
This is like a modular chess game.  It's easy to teach and plays through quick and simple.  The more often we play the better we get (and the longer our games take), but it definitely works as a gateway game too.

This is mini-chess as far as I'm concerned. You have a set  number of pieces, each with its own special mechanic. After playing a few games, you develop your own opening strategy and going first is a slight advantage. It plays very quickly, usually is decisive and is very portable (it doesn't have or need a board!!). Don't really care for all the expansions because they feel tacked on to me and the base game plays very well without them (at a cost of more frequent draws though).

I like this game, even if I am not good playing it. I lose most times. Very simple, short, but exciting at the same time. 

No soy nada bueno a este juego, pero me gusta mucho. Cortito, sencillo en las reglas, pero emocionante.

A bit too abstract for my tastes - still seems like a reasonably quick brainburner for two.

RATING: 10
One of the best board games I've ever played.  Plays anywhere, no setup, pure strategy/tactics with no luck, almost always takes under an hour (often much less).  Beautiful, virtually indestructible components and a unique theme; not that theme is the big draw here, but at least it isn't farming, war, or Cthulu.

Has a chessy feel due to the 'capture the main piece' win condition, but usually doesn't take as long, and this game hasn't been bludgeoned to death by computers yet either.  If you like abstracts and you don't own this game, you are doing it wrong.

RATING: N/A
With no setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down. As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board). Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent's queen, whilst at the same time trying to block your opponent from doing likewise to your queen. The player to totally surround his opponent's queen wins the game. I have the cool bakelite version. Expanded by Hive - The Mosquito

I'm not a big fan of abstract strategy games, and this is another of those kinds of games.  The rules are very straightforward and easy to learn, but I seem to lack the ability to "see" ahead into the game.  Still, it's a short game, and it elicits that "Just one more time!" response.  I'm convinced that if I can just play it some more, I will figure out the best way to play it, so it's very likely that I will play this one many more times.

Pra quem gosta de xadrez, esse jogo é uma maravilha. Pra quem não gosta, também! Jogo MUITO estratégico pra 2 pessoas. O tema não é muito importante, apesar de funcionar legal. É bem abstrado e pode derreter o cérebro de alguém com as estratégias que podem ser tomadas. Cada jogada muda totalmente o jogo. Muito bom mesmo.

This is like a more "fun" form of chess ...doesn't feel so serious and heavy but each move is still highly strategic. I think Hive provides a sense of freedom because it doesn't require a board; each consecutive piece played forms the board. Especially like how each game is nice and short (around 15 minutes) -- easy to get in a best out of 3 and not feel mentally exhausted :)

Hive is a highly addictive strategic game for two players that is not restricted by a board and can be played anywhere on any flat surface. Hive is made up of twenty two pieces, eleven black and eleven white, resembling a variety of creatures each with a unique way of moving.\13\ \13\
With no setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down. As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board).

I enjoyed this one a lot more than expected!  The gameplay was quick and easy, and I love the quality of the components.  The addition of the mosquito and ladybug pieces are also nice.

First game I've rated a 9 in a good long time...and here I thought I was getting curmudgeony...

This is a really great, tense, short, knife fight in a phone booth type game. I absolutely love the idea of building the "hive" as you go, and that even the pieces you have on the board at any given time are up to you. With more plays, this might even have a shot at moving up to a 10. I always knew I was an abstract gamer at heart...

This game has a three-prong reward structure.  Mentally, I get to participate in the game's elegant boardless design.  Emotionally, I'm allowed the opportunity to point out that, sorry man, you're going to lose in 3 moves.  And physically, I can take pleasure in the weight and feel of the hexagonal wooden pieces, which makes me both mentally suspect and downright odd.

I like this game. Some of what I like is the cool tiles and the insect theme. Underneath that is a middleweight abstract game. It is similar to chess in that different pieces have different roles/moves and it has a capture the piece end-game. Although this is a fairly easy game to get into it is not trivial for me to get good at it. I may adjust my rating based on additional playing.

Hive is like a short, board-less version of chess with fewer pieces.  We have a blast every time we play it, but for some reason we just opt for other games more often.  The tiles seem near indestructible, and it can be played almost anywhere. Even the full-sized Hive is a good option for taking on trips.

I fell in love with this game after looking at the pieces and reading the rules, and did a complete 180 after playing it.  Didn't enjoy a single thing about the game.  Has the same dry feel as chess but doesn't offer the same kind of rewards.  Despite how much I hated it, and I did absolutely hate playing it, it seems like a decent game for the right type of person.

The best part about this game is its portability. My Significant Other and I like to bring it along if we know our destination involves a substantial wait. All that is required to get a game going is a flat surface.

The game design is simple and the rules are extremely easy to understand, yet the possibilities are infinite and the strategy involved reasonably deep. It is quite amazing that so much thought can be packed into so few tiles.

If there is a ranking for boardgames in terms of fun factor per unit of gaming equipment, then Hive will be No. 1.

[b]TRULY EXCELLENT.[/b]

Deep, quick, brain-burner of a game. A board-less affair with chesslike maneuvring, and heaps of continual jockeying for optimum position.
Hive is virtually unknown outside the grand halls of the gaming cognisenti, which is a gargantuan disgrace. I try to spread the gospel of Hive everywhere I go, reaching out to orphans and offering them hexagonal beetles...

On first playing this, my group started a winner-stays-on thing around the table. I took to the game like a duck to water, and ended up playing continually. No one could beat me... that night or ever. The glove is down.
I have the fantastic bakelite edition, and had to ship it from Germany to get it. Why didn't a British distributor grab this with both greedy paws? Who knows the minds of these clay-pipe smoking merchants? Not little old me.

Back to the game! Hive looks great and plays better. Simple to learn, difficult to master. How many more soundbites can I squeeze into my ramblings about this game? Quite a truckload more, I should say!
My GF hates it - playing with insects switches her mind right off! Then again, she likes Scooby Doo Monopoly.

I discover a new play, or strategy, every single time I play this wonderful game.
Hive works beautifully as a travel game or as a sit-down game at home. The feel of the heavy pieces is also a PERFECT geek pleasure. Yeah, baby.
The only thing I would have done differently to the designer: changed the powers of the beetle and the spider around. No joke.
What! Why do that?
Because it makes more sense for a spider to pin other bugs. Plus, spiders are cooler insects. Period.

Some people seem to have trouble remembering the specific powers of each bug - don't play with these losers. Play instead with someone who loves gaming as much as me!

[b]STRATEGY TIPS:[/b]

1.Remember that the queen can move too - some folks leave her stranded!
2.Use your ants - they are the most versatile piece, and your saviour/destroyer.
3.Use the beetle to enable placing of your own pieces about her - this is just gravy!
4.Try to pin your opponent's pieces when they have formed "arms".
5. Sometimes the hive will form 2 "arms" that are almost touching - use this to your advantage: move pieces across the divide, if advantageous.
6. NEVER give up! There's always a killer move you could make, you only have to look harder...

I could play this marvellous little game until the cows came home.. had tea and scones, and run a bath.

Great production value on the bakelite edition, and there is a few innovative concepts in terms of how some of the pieces move after their initial placement.  However, I fail to see what is so great about Hive when compared to the tried and true staples of Chess and XiangQi, besides the shorter play duration and the possibility that it doesn't suffer from people of different skill levels.  Also, it seems that most of the game is spent on trapping the opponent's queen so it can no longer run away, after that the rest of the moves are pretty procedural and obvious.  Definitely wasn't overly impressed by it after hearing so many good things.

THIS GAME IS AWESOME!  I consider this in my top five favorite games.  I love the strategy!  It's amazing how much it makes my brain work.  There is simply nothing I have bad to say about this game.  I would like to make one recommendation: PLEASE MAKE MORE EXPANSION TILES!!  The Ladybug and Mosquito are simply fantastic.  Critters to consider: Scorpion, Butterfly, Worm, Centipede, Pill-bug, Cockroach, Moth, Fly and Dragonfly.  Mechanics to explore: something that removes tiles, pushes tiles, or maybe trades places with tiles.  

To summarize - this game is amazing!

The most played game in our group. Everyone owns a set and we're constantly relating stories of how we beat each other, how we can trace it back to the exact move where we went wrong, and how we'll crush each other next time.

This is a GREAT game and very fun!

I was actually surprised with this one.  I usually read many reviews before making a game purchase and have a pretty good idea what gameplay will be like, but this one turned out different than what I expected.  It is actually better.

Many reviews state that this game is light and an excellent filler; however, there is so much more going on here. Players must pay close attention to their opponent's moves while planning out their own route to victory.  This is more difficult than it sounds, especially if you have a skilled and competitive opponent.

I recommend this excellent game to everyone!  It should be a must addition to every board game collection!

A very good game that is short to play and easy to teach, yet deep in strategic play. It is all about pinning, blocking and moving. 

Beware that the white player is having the advantage to begin and set up a strategy, while the black player reacts and tries to get the initiative.

Fast, tense, portable, and surprisingly thematic for an astract. This is a welcome addition to my collection. The new pieces (Mosquito and Labybug) fit right in and are very useful.

Insect tiles with special powers make this a lovely abstract.

Amazingly good two player game. Teaches very quickly.  As you become more proficient, it's easy to see the countdown to when you will win or lose.  This is true for most abstracts, but Hive makes it a little to obvious due to the low number of pieces.

good cerebral game for two.  Chess like, but without the intensity.

I just purchased this game for the ipod touch, but I've played the real game a few times.  It's a nice little abstract.  I'm happy to see board games start to be released digitally.  This is a nice game to have on hand for down time.

A friend of mine got this from a 'Secret Santa' and we have taken to playing it while waiting for tardy gamers on game night.  It is a fun game and more challenging than you would think watching someone else play.

A very nice abstract.  Most games go the same way after a few dozen plays though...

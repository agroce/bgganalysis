RATING: 7
I wanted to love it, but I didn't.  It took much longer than it should have.  Most of the game wasn't exciting.  There was far too much luck.  Some cards were massively overpowered, some were useless.
Maybe it was the scenario we played. Or maybe it was because we had 4 players.
I'd give it another go.

Update: played twice more the basic scenario, 2 players.  It was still highly luck dependent, but it was fun.

RATING: 9.8
This game, plus its expansions, is the game I love to play over and over. It oozes theme, and gives my wife and I something to play that pits us against each other, or, if there are more people playing, work together towards a common goal. I still tell stories about events that have taken place within this game. It is my favorite game, and while I've been looking for something to take its place, it's hard to replace.

My only nits with this game are that it takes a long time to set up and there isn't a solo campaign. Otherwise, it is the perfect game for me.

This game is just plain ridiculous. We put in the CD with the creepy zombie noises (not required) and had a blast. If you're looking for actual strategy, look elsewhere.

This game is just so much fun - if you like zombies and play with other zombie enthusiasts. 

If it didn't capture the spirit and quirkiness of the old zombie films as amazingly good as it does, I would probably rate it 5-6.

RATING: 7
Seems ridiculously slanted towards the zombie player(s).  I keep hoping the expansion cards will fix this, but so far no luck.  A dicefest without much strategy.  Luck of the draw for the hero cards pretty much dictates win or lose.

Sounds like a pretty fun game, and lots of people have been talking about it.  My Dead of Night PnP is almost finished, though, so I might not need two zombie games.  

I've played this a few times now and enjoyed myself.  I still don't think it's as good as Dead of Night, but that's okay.

This game was at one time my most played game. Good quality components and an engaging theme that really recreate the look and feel of a zombie film. I thought there were some balance issues in the beginning, but these are not so bad if the characters really look at their options, and develop a strategy they all can agree on from the beginning of the game. This game plays like a dungeon crawl, but with the halls of the dungeon replaced by the buildings in the town of Woodinvale. There are some very intense moments, and it always feels as if the heroes are right on the brink of death. Playing the zombie player in the base game is fun, but definitely not as fun as being a hero. (Expansions fix this to some degree, especially Survival of the fittest.) If you like zombie movies, zombie books and well.....zombie everything else....Buy this game

This game is a blast to play! It's super fun party game and something you can play also (or especially) with friends who are not hardcore boardgamers. At it's best when served with a few cold beers and a healthy dose of not-taking-it-too-seriously!

Ok, played it again after a while and yeah.. it's a fun party game, bit not so great as I recalled. I'll knock the rating down a notch.

One of my favorite genre games.  Great game for two players, great game for six.  Also, every time we play it, it becomes a viable zombie movie script.  One playthrough ended up with all of the heroes holed up in one building, while the zombies were swarming the town square.  One hero ran out and doused the town square with gasoline, and another hero ran out and shot a flare gun at it, setting it and all of the zombies ablaze.

This seems to work best with one player controlling all zombies. Most sessions have been a lot of fun, but two sessions have failed completely: One 2p game where a lucky draw made me win on round 2 and one where two zombie players didn't manage to form a coherent strategy, making the game very easy for the humans and boring for everyone.

RATING: 5
Every time I play this game, there is at least two or three arguments about a particular rule or a card's power.  The sheer number of pushes in hand-to-hand fights make the game a little tedious.
---
Had a chance to play this one again over Halloween weekend.  The main problem in the game is that the time to choice ratio is way off.  In a 2 hour game, I had 10 turns that took less than a minute to conclude.  Even worse, most of the player's "choices" are usually incredibly obvious.  I like zombies just as much as the next guy, but the theme is completely lost in the minutia of this game.

I was pretty nonplussed with my first play (it went way too long and didn't offer many interesting decisions), but we did do the basic scenario. I think my rating could go up if I could try some more interesting scenarios, but I highly doubt I will play it again anytime soon.

RATING: 9
Lots of fun strategies for the heroes and the zombie players. Our battle was epic and totally felt like we were in a grindhouse movie running for our lives. The cards, board spaces, and weapons give this a great flavor besides fun game play. The large squares in the middle are a great touch for movement. If your in the open, you feel like you can outrun the zombies to get where you want. but if your in a building, and zombies are blocking your exits, you really have to battle your way out or you need help fast.

Fun game - oozing and dripping with theme!  Need to try the advanced game.

Update: Have played the advanced game now.  It's great!  More interesting things to do in the game, though the basic mechanics and luck are still intact.  My rating seems solid at the grade now.

The art and production of this game are fantastic!  It has to be one of the best produced games (along with Duel in the Dark) that I have seen.First game was pretty good - a little longer than expected at 1hr30mins, but enjoyable and easy to play.

I'm not looking for the ultimate Zombie game - it's never been a theme I crave. But for a zombie dice fest, this one is alright. It's pretty zippy and certainly difficult to win (on one side or the other - depends). I love the Indie nature of the design and graphics - so that's a large plus for me. Nothing terribly innovative here, however, so don't look for much past the rich and gooey theme.

RATING: 9.5
Last two games have been with 8 and 7 players, respectively (using the two expansions and point systems).  Great balance, and not unwieldly considering, but a huge potential alpha-geek problem pushed both sessions to 4+ hours.  Needs a timer, simultaneous moves and careful scenario selection when dealing w/ lots of players.  Not a minus; it never claimed to be able to do this.

*Rating based on 1 play.

I'm not a fan of zombies, and so the theme really doesn't do anything for me.  It's also too repetitive,  too light on strategy and takes too long to play for my tastes.

Played once - Wife didn't care for. With one player controlling the heroes and others controlling the zombies, there is a strong competitive flavor. We found the artwork to be kitchy, and the gameplay overall to be underwhelming. Sold it and never looked back.

Love it, but I'm a big zombie nerd. Works really well with 2, my fiance and I have been trading off as the hero players. She swears she's better than me but she stinks. This is that game she judged Claustrophobia against. She likes the fact that in combat both parties roll dice, in claustrophobia the defending character has a stat which determines if the dice roll is a hit or miss. She also likes the cards which add variability like weapons and special abilities very frequently. Overall great zombie game.

RATING: 4
You will probably need a Zombie or two to play the zombies after the first scenario, whilst the heroes will be enjoyed by your average brain-dead gamer. Very simplistic man-to-man combat. Good production values. Perhaps mainly for the young and/or non-gamers. The CD was a nice touch, or would have been if the music on it was related to the playing experience. 
A second play of the basic game scenario suggests something is wrong somewhere, as this will not be won by four heroes unless they are heavily tooled up at game start. This seems unlikely to vary. The advanced game and cards may change things, however it makes me wonder about the quality of the testing, if any, like that's unusual.

RATING: 8
A very fun game. LNOE succeeds where nearly every other game in this genre has failed. It's thematic, has a reasonable play length, multiple scenarios, low down time, excellent production values, clean rules, etc, etc. It's not trying to be the next Caylus, but if you are looking for a zombie game and feel that a heavy dose of luck fits well with the genre, then I don't think you'll find a better candidate. Extra points for the nice combination of cooperation and player vs. player.

First play was a lot of fun. Unfortunately, had several questions on rules that we couldn't find in the book, so that took a little bit away, but we had an enjoyable time, and will want to play again sometime soon to try out some of the different scenarios.

Have played a couple more times, and while I like this game, it can definitely drag at times. I think it's best played by the seat of your pants, and not trying to optimize every single move. It also unfortunately suffers from a decent amount of double checking of the rulebook for different situations that arise.

RATING: 10
This is an excellent game.  I played this quite a bit early on in it's development, and it's amazing to see the finished product, and how well of a job Jason and the other Flying Frog folks have done.  It's really a masterpiece, from someone who is basically a genius at designing board games.  I'm certain there will be a lot more fantastic games from Flying Frog to look forward to in the future as well (which also have some great themes and I personally know are just as great as this one - although I won't say more than that out of respect for confidentiality).  If you like themed games, you must buy this (actually if you like board games of any sort, you should get it - it's definately a 10/10 in my opinion)...

very fun zombie game. feels like the B movies of the 80's with the characters and theme. has multiple scenarios so game changes with each play. only thing I didn't like was the characters are all a gray color and can be tricky to tell apart from each other. I painted mine (made me feel like a nerd lol) but it added to the overall enjoyment of my next few plays. comes with a CD of music but I don't really think it was needed....you can find much scarier music from horror movies to play if you want to be really in the mood. zombie player can be alil long on their turns compaired to the heros as well. not a bad game for people that don't normally play miniature games.

RATING: 6
I played 2 scenarios of this: the one involving getting escaping by pickup truck and the one about defending the manor.
This has a lot of similarities to [thing=35815]A Touch of Evil[/thing], especially in the production values.
What I liked: the high quality of the cards.  The short game play.  The plastic.  Some of the card text (notably teenage angst and the card that gave the game its name).
What I didn't like: It seemed imbalanced in favor of the zombies.  
I think if the heroes beat the zombie with only 1 die, they fought them off, but if they win with 2 dice, they kill the zombie.  In two games, I never saw a zombie die by rolling doubles.  It's just too difficult.
Also, theme and rules didn't intersect at one point.  As the zombie player, I played "locked door" on two of his characters and locked them into the gym.  My zombies would burst in and attack, but after killing the zombies, the heroes could not leave.  Huh?  You can't walk through that big hole in the wall or floor?  That play was a game changer.
Overall, though, I think there it was a good game.  The combat system might need a little tweaking to bring balance, or maybe I just didn't play enough games.  It was a good enough game that I would like to play it again, and if I do, I will revise comments and ratings accordingly.

Fun zombie carnage!  (Need I say more?  Apparently yes.)

Doesn't rate higher because gameplay is very random.  Humans spend time getting to a building and searching for items.  Zombies plod along trying to corner the humans.

Doesn't rate lower because it is *very* thematic.  Theme and gameplay connect very well.  Plus, it's just fun to play.  Very enjoyable.

Excellent for what it is - a zombie survival game that is very reminiscent of zombie movies.

I really like this game but you really need people who like the theme. 

The game isn't unbalanced, but it's a bit automatic; the human and zombie strategies aren't really very fleshed out! Generally every scenario is a race between being super-equipped and being overrun. 

This isn't a bad thing, it just needs people into the theme to keep it going. I'll never suggest it but I'm happy to play it 2-3 times in a row.

I'm a sucker for zombie games and although I could easily make a compilation CD for any game, it sounds like a nice touch. I think I'll have to get this!
Ok so I got it and if I'm totally honest, it was CRAP! Really cheesy, not at all scary or atmospheric. I am of course talking about the free CD. A nice touch, but pointless, for a start it was too short and it sounded like a dance-ejay version of a film score! Luckily the game fucking ROCKS!!! It's so cool! Nice miniatures, chunky cards, easy set up simple rules! Plays much better than 'Zombies!!!' but (again, sorry Richard) it is quite like Richard's game 'Deadwood(?)' but with only Zombies to choose from and someone gets to be the zombies!!
Unfortunately Adie had an absolutely appalling game (as far as Die rolling went) and I managed to eat her face off quite easily! Not once did I doubt my zombie abilities to take over the world! On the even more plus side, although I kicked Adie's ass this time round she still really enjoyed it too! Whoop! A first go score of 9.5!!!!

In my second game, I was heroes and had to find a key and gasoline to escape in the truck; seemed very random, waiting for the right draw from the deck. In the end, very close, right up to the wire, a couple more turns and I might have won. But I found it boring, just waiting for my turn so I could draw from the deck. But would try it again to see how different it can be.

Oh how AnotherHorrorFan loves this game. Really effectively conveys the zombie feel. I convinced a friend to get the game, without playing it with me first, and he proceeded to hate it. After talking with him I found he was playing with a number of rules wrong, namely; deciding to search before rolling, and more than one zombie card played per fight. I feel like a lot of bad rap this game gets is due to minor rules confusions like that. Finally got around to painting it and am around half way done.

Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of zombie movies and this is my first ever zombie game. The game is nice, especially the miniatures which add to an overall super good quality, but the game play is pretty simplistic. As human, not much to do other than ... kill zombies or be wounded or killed by them. Not many items, not many combos, just shoot or hit and wait for dawn. The length of the game is fine, it is funny and the game immerses players in the zombie world very well. Rated based on theme not so much on the game play.

Is a B movie transformed into a board game, the art of the cards, the text in them and the missions make you feel like a survivor (or a zombie) in a B movie.

Don't expect a HIGH tactical game here... just enjoy the game and think you are the one in the movie.

More than anything, I kind of hate how swingy this game is.  Good or bad cards or rolls for one side or the other can just break the game.  It's really not fun when one side can't do anything worthwhile.

This game looks awesome. After a review I read some people think its broken after first couple of plays. As the Zombies win win win. Then you learn the game and it gets freaking awesome. 2- player is said to be very tactical. You have to know exactly what you are doing and what your plan is. Not advisable to play 1st couple of games with only 2players. 

Edit:  It is like Arkham lite, I definitely want another play of it before I consider adding it to the collection.

RATING: 8
A very thematic game which evokes its theme by producing a lot of tension between the zombies and heroes.  Comes packed with some nice components and movie-ish artwork to further make the game come alive.  Its theme helps to draw in non-gamers and the various scenarios create replayability to a really fun game.

Side Note: I opened a new copy and found that the main board along with a couple cards had suffered some packaging damage.  After emailing Flying Frog Productions they quickly (Priority Mail) sent me the replacements.  Thanks!

Love the theme and artwork. Basically a zombie movie in board game form. All of the standard zombie movie cliches are here. The assortment of scenarios, board pieces, and characters keep the game interesting. Some games can be very stacked in the zombies or player's favor depending on card draws but never really kills the fun. While I loved the game itself, it just never got played very much and ate up a lot of shelf space, so we ended up selling this one off.

Played only once so far. Looks nice with two players but I guess it works better with more players. Artwork and miniatures are really nice and the game gives you a bit of '80s flavour. It needs to be play more times to fully understand and appreciate it.

Great aesthetics, cool characters, well-painted terrain boards....but the mechanics of the game couldn't pull off the theme.  I am a big zombie fan, so I was excited about this game, but once I started playing I was disappointed with how little it felt like what it was selling.  Zombies didn't seem very scary and there was very little tension.  Even when I was losing to the zombies, it was kind of a "ho hum" loss.  I'm told that "The Walking Dead" boardgame is much better at this despite having the aesthetics of a scary Monopoly game.  I'm also hoping that "City of Horror" is good...we'll see.

We had a lot of fun with this.  The cards -- representing items and events -- were fun to collect and play with.  The game system was easy to grasp, though some of the cards required consulting the lengthy FAQ.  Our game played out very thematically, as the priest rushed a hoard of zombies with a meat cleaver so the rest of the group could make an escape... but he ended up killing the entire hoard.

The box claims a 1 hour play time but after my third play I've definitely concluded that reality is more like 2.5 hours. This should be a light game of chaos and mayhem that's over pretty quickly. There's plenty of chaos and mayhem but the game just drags on as each side plays cards that prevent the other side from making any progress. It reminds me very much of Kill Doctor Lucky, another game that I want to like but that just takes too long for what it is.

Decent enough game if you want something light. It rattles along perfectly well and looks great (but doesn't sound great - that spooky CD that comes with it isn't that spooky at all, I normally put the music from Twin Peaks on in the background). Gripes: although the Zombies normally seem to win, the board is never utterly packed with them so you don't really get the impression of a horde; although nice looking the town is a bit strange with that huge gap in the centre; and the Defend the Manor scenario doesn't work - because there are no weapons in it you spend most of the game dashing out to other buildings, instead of barracading yourself inside.
Update: sold.

Elsőre nem győzött meg, elég lapos volt, de mindenképp szeretnék még vele játszani, valami bonyolultabb küldetést is. Küllemére és helyenként mechanizmusában is a Cluedo-ra emlékeztet (ez nem túl jó ajánlólevél szerintem), hasonló a helyszínrajz, a mozgás is szinte ugyanaz, csak itt nem nyomozunk, hanem zombikat ölünk (vagy épp zombikkal embert). Azt hiszem ez az a műfaj, amit tilos komolyan venni. Nem annyira az én stílusom, de egynek elment:) Azt is el kell ismernem, hogy nagyon rossz hatásfokkal öltünk zombikat, lehet, hogy ezért nem élveztem annyira:)
A külleme jó, némelyik játékelem kiugróan igényes (a szereplők kis kartonja, meg a kártyák), a játék nyelvfüggő. Elég gyorsan lement egy parti.

Wow.  What a fun game.  This is an experience game and not very strategic, which is fine.  The choices are very simple but it is great fun!  The game really unfolds just like a horror movie.  The heroes start out away from each other as they frantically search for items to help them survive.  As the game goes on, they realize there are other people in town trying to stay alive as well and band together to increase their chances until they finally win.  I love the fact that the system is so flexible that this game can be expanded ad infinitum.  It is also great that the game is scenario driven so each game will feel differently on top of the crazy things that happen in the game.  Hands down, this is the BEST EXPERIENCE-TYPE GAME.  This is what Arkham Horror and Fury of Dracula should have been.  Turns are very fast that keeps the action going and the experience moving.  Overall, just a lot of fun!  I have been waiting for a game like this to augment my Heavy-Strategy biased collection.

I am not usually good at things like making scenarios as I am rubbish at balance however this game felt quite easy and good make own scenarios and is the only game that I have actually done this. Some problems are on certain scenarios especially with expansion cards added in that if you have to search for something such as gas etc. that it could be at bottom of the pile however easily solved by mixing if to half way in the pack but does not rule out the problem that it may be the first card you get.

My wife and I have been enjoying playing this game 2 player. The first time my wife played, she got a little frustrated with it. But once she started thinking about it as a zombie movie being played out as a board game, she's had a lot more fun with it.
It seems that this game is really about how well the heroes can work together versus how well the zombie player can play their cards. There are some tactical decisions to be made. Nothing real brain burning by any means, but enough to make it fun. And that's really what this game is about, I think. Having a fun experience whether you win or lose. At one point, I was rooting for my hero to get turned into a zombie, just so it would happen. That's the kind of game it is.
I think my only concern is with the limited number of scenarios.

I took the bait at Gen Con 2007, getting a kick out of Flying Frog's exhibit of live characters. The game is light fun and captures the zombie theme perfectly.

Update: Getting more into this game lately and having fun so my rating goes up.

If you are looking for a competitive strategy game, this isn't it.  It's a gorgeous and well-designed experience game.  Every game I've played has led to a moment where everyone at the table is laughing over something that happened.  Best with 3 players.

my first zombie game.pretty disgusted by the dull game experience.zombies go through walls.i saw a lot of zombie reviews lately.i think that dead of winter accomplishes the zombie feel by adding more story to the characters and zombie 15 captures the zombie/frantic acttion of a b-flick movie.

LNoE doesnt do both of them and it makes a zombie theme more dull with the slow paced mechanics and actions.

I love zombie movies, and playing this game makes me feel like I'm in the middle of one. The card play beautifully evokes all the cliches of B-grade horror and the boards and miniatures are top notch -- it's a thematic masterpiece. Any game that can cause the group to erupt into cheers after a dramatic move is a clear winner, in my book. I think this could be my favourite game.

Haven't played many Zombie games, but this one is a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Positives: Simple mechanics, fun (mostly the cinematic quality of the game: a few survivors holding out against an army of zombies where bad luck is in inevitable, while the smallest piece of luck could bring on victory), (to emphasize) very good theme, nice bits.

Negatives: Scary theme (as noted in at least one review: not suitable for children or people who are easily frightened).  The luck factor can be a problem if you're looking for much strategy or control (of course this game is set up with the theme of heroes who can't seem to get a break).  Some of the cards can up the learning curve (nothing out of the range of your average CCG, though).  Might get kind of boring playing the zombies sometimes.

Plays: 
2-player: 3
3-player: 3 (2nd game Zombies squashed the heroes because they couldn't find weapons or get die rolls as consistently as the zombies)
4-player: 1 (played with only three hero characters. Result: Routed Heroes. Probably will be more balance with the full compliment.)

Strangely, it sometimes feels that LNOE's successor, Invasion from Outer Space, is more successful at getting the theme of the game across, despite it basically being a modification on Last Night's zombie-centric ruleset. Complaints about the zombie player's role being pretty boring are valid, although I wouldn't go as far as to say that.

This is one of my favourite games ever. Every mechanic adds to the zombie horror feel of the game to me. Also, I very rarely have a game that seems one-sided. Each time it comes down to critical plays near the final turns. The game can take a bit of time with new players reading their cards, however. Also, since the zombies have managed more wins than the heroes, many of my mates don't play anymore (even though those games were also pretty close...)

Like cooperative Zombies!!! with scenarios.  Probably what Zombies!!! should have been in the first place.  At the same time, feels so similar, that I wonder that this is really anything you couldn't do with Zombies!!! itself.  Would like to play again with a different scenario at some point.

A thrilling survival game featuring -surprise- zombies!

Move your stereotypical survivor around in town in order to find mission relevant items or just to kill zombies. 

One or two players take over the control of the zombies the others play the survivors. 

The zombie-side gets the usual helping scenarios like "lights going out", "survivors panicking" and "locked doors without reason".
The survivors get weapons and gear to deplete the plague.
As usual there is more zombies than weapons in the beginning and sooner or later, one of the player gets bitten and eventually turns into a zombie before whatever task is done - you know: the works.

Played it with fans of the genre and I liked it a lot.

We've played eight games and they have all been fun and exciting. There are some nice checks-and-balances to make the battles go back and forth. This game is very well themed.

RATING: 7
This is one of the first zombie games I ever played, and while i still like it, a few years ago my review would likely have been more glowing. The art style of this game looks like pictures of actors in a b-movie which seemed clever at first, but over time I got tired of it. Of this style of game, I like recent ones more, especially those that forego someone controlling the zombies and instead have a natural system for their movement, because ultimately in this game the zombie player doesn't really have that many choices to make. It's pretty clear to all what the best thing to do is most of the time for them. This is also true of the humans, and often i find the strategy to be to hide in a room until you can find what you need in the deck. While this makes a great deal of sense thematically, this particular occurrence doesn't make for exciting gameplay. 

Still a very good game that I'd be happy to play, but given the choice, I'd go with zombicide black plague, or maybe dead of winter.

You really owe it to yourself to give this one a go, especially if you are a fan of The Walking Dead.  There are enough scenarios for varied play, the modular board is brilliant, the miniatures are nice, the cards are good quality.  Everything is so thematic!  Searching for items can be dull at times, though.  The biggest downside is that it's really only best with 3 or 5 people.

RATING: 8
I don’t like zombie games: they all feel the same, a cheap and unoriginal jumble of the same stale concepts. Yet today zombies are even trendier, so much they keep coming in all kinds of ways. So imagine my  excitement when I was asked to play Last Night on Earth, despite the cool miniatures that come with the game: yet I changed my mind soon after this game started as it’s lots of fun.

To begin with, its rules are very simple both to teach and understand: you grasp the basics quickly, then you keep improving your playing as the game progresses. In the second place, the semi-cooperative nature of the game - that lets a player control the zombies and the others play as the humans - makes it more challenging and changing every time you play: even the different - and thematically inspired - decks for the zombie and human players help have a very open game. Then, your goal isn’t simply «survive a fixed number of turns» or «kill all the humans» but you also have to actively do something, even if it’s something as easy as killing the most zombies you can or scare the hell out of the characters. Finally, all the materials are high-quality, which is always a win in my book.

I have no idea how the many expansions work, whether they are worthy and, in case, which of them are not to be missed, as I didn’t try out any of them: I did play the basic game only and I deeply enjoyed my time with it.

Whelp... here's the one that really kicked me into gear of "good games".  My wife (girlfriend at the time) bought this as a "housewarming" gift when I moved in with her.  Looking up rules clarification for this game is what lead me to BoardgameGeek.com in the first place!  From there - as many can probably say the same - I slid right into the world of "oh man, there are so many good games out there!"

Recently down-rated it from a 9 to a 7 simply because I've played it SO many times, that it's hard to get motivated to play (especially with so many other games on our shelves)!

I like the game -- there is nothing quite like it in my collection, and the game is very thematic and fun.  My inclination is to give it an 8.  However, there can be a lot of downtime, especially if there are two zombie players and they have to coordinate with each other.  The event cards can also make the game very frustrating, especially for the heroes. 

Another complaint is that the way the hero deck is stacked at the beginning, not the decisions the players make, is the main determining factor in whether the heroes win or lose.  Well, this is no different than many cooperative games.  You just have to approach it as a story being told and not as a battle of wits.

Still a really fun game.  I like Betrayal at House on the Hill, too, but for most people I'd recommend this game over that.  They aren't trying to do the same thing, exactly, but for most people it isn't worth it to seek out Betrayal if LNoE is readily available.  LNoE is the better game.

RATING: 6.5
Played this a few times. Like other Zombie games, beautiful production values but ultimately not much fun. Loved it as the humans. All enjoyment disappeared the second I had to play the Zombies. Then I justhad to sit by while the humans spent half an hour plannng their move carefully, looking over cards and having a ball. Then it was my move - five minutes of card play and moving plastic zombies around ineffectually. Suffice to say I got bored VERY quickly, wouldn't play this one again unless there was no other option. Not unbalanced in terms of gameplay, but just not that much fun for the zombie player.

This game is pretty awesome and is definitely worth playing and purchasing.  That said, some of the humans have overpowering traits (cough...sheriff...cough) and it is tough for the zombies to compete if the humans load up on guns and bunker in a building.

Still need to try out all of the scenarios so rating could increase.  Expansion with more characters and scenarios sounds cool as well.

Summary:  Quick play that allows for up to 6 people to have an enjoyable time. Girlfriend and cousin even got into blowing up zombies with dynamite after they picked up the gameplay. Can be slightly unbalanced at times but a definite keeper.  BRRRRRRAAAAAAAAIIIIIIINNNNNNNSSSSS!!!

It's very ameritrash, so it pretty much boils down to card drawing and dice rolling: games like these rely on their theme to bring enjoyment to the gamers.

However, my first play of this game was quite disappointing (the "die, zombies, die" scenario): about after the 4th turn the zombies were actively running away from the characters, making for quite the (crappy) role-reversal in this game. 

"Oh, the zombies are all hiding in that house!"... That's totally lame =(

(of course, I'd have to play more scenarios to give this a full review, and I am willing to do it, but so far it did not give a good 1st impression)

See my comments for Arkham Horror.  Same exact Ameritrash fan begged to play this and again I wanted to be nice... and again it was a miserable and LONG experience for all involved.  I finally told him that I just didn't like the same kinds of games that he likes...  Best in the long run.  Hopefully he found others who enjoy the same games that he does.

Update: Played Dave's copy with him, Matt, Kiai and Travis.  In the end, it still sucked waiting around to roll that freaking die that freaking hates me, but luckily everyone played very quickly and the game moved much faster.  We also solved the mission VERY quickly which the others were sorry about, but I was very happy about :-)  I will play again with matt and dave.... if they make me :-P

This game almost always generates a good time. The rules are simple, the theme is engaging and the game seems always to take just the right amount of time. Even the minor frustrations such as never being able to draw a needed card seem to fit with the "can't get a break" tone of the schlocky zombie movie this game is meant to recreate. One can have reasonably deep strategy though luck plays an undeniable roll. The scenarios are creative and replayable. No expansions are required, but Growing Hunger and Survival of the Fittest (in that order) are worth it for exploring further.

I love this game even though it hates me. I love how each play is like scripting out a B-grade zombie movie. One of the best implementations of a theme that I've seen thus far. Love the components. The die rolls for movement and combat can be and are brutal (oh man I lose so much) and a lot of the cardplay can be frustratingly ambiguous, resulting in a lot of house ruling for us, but I love the theme, which goes a long way toward overlooking the flaws. The ability to come up with your own scenarios is a big plus. Majority of plays have been 2 player, one controlling the zombies and the other controlling four heroes, although two of them were with four (three hero players, one controlling two heroes, and one zombie player) - changes the dynamic of the game a lot when you have more people plotting on how to kill the zombies.

I love zombie's in general and i think this game is well themed but the lack of zombies on the board at once and the size of board space / spawning points available are a bit dissapointing....but i do enjoy playing when i can.

LNoE is a game that is more about setting and theme than mechanics.  A great game for when I'm out at the lake with buddies, as we're all quite fond of the Zombie theme and the mechanics are decent enough.  My regular group does not play it much, as we prefer Zombies!!! for a fast-paced zombie horror game.

I will say that if you have people that get into the theme, this is a great game as you make some of your own fun and can really appreciate the campy goodness of the game.

Love the production values, all of the cards are photos of actors and really add to the game.

The d6 based movement just drives me nuts.  Not quite as enjoyable as the first few games, not sure I'm going to bother with it any more.  It's moved to the 'don't play often' shelf.

Now it's moved to someone else's shelf, I traded it for Puerto Rico.

Only played once so far, but this game was a riot.  Played just the basic game, and I was the zombies.  I could feel the tension from the players.  Everyone had a good time.  Comes with a music cd that isn't scary, but fun and clever just the same.  This plays 2-6 we had 3.  I would like to try more,but the scenario given was down to the wire, and not really lopsided.  There were a few moments of tranquility and a bunch of butt clenching goodness.  FUN!

This game is a perfectly mindless ameritrash game.  

When I say mindless I don't mean you don't have to think, I do mean you won't care if you do or don't as the game is more about quality kills and some exciting dice throwing.  It is a somewhat comical game but it doesn't mean that it doesn;t have its place.

I figure its sweet spot is four people (maybe also 13-19 years of age... ) and maybe within a party setting.  That being said if your in the mood for a fun zombie game...this is it.

Fishing for Hero Cards is not so fun.  Deciding to stay and search when zombies are one step away, or drawing the attention of a group of zombies so another player can escape?  Lots of fun.

I will preface this review in that I played the zombie side in this game and even though I won, this game was very frustrating and boring.  As the zombies you draw cards and if you draw something good you can play it, else you move one space and that's it.  Then you wait while the heroes move around up to 6 spaces depending on a die roll and search to find new gear and new items.  Then it's the zombie turn again, draw so cards, move one space, back to the heroes.  It was incredibly boring playing the zombies and I knew exactly what we needed to do to win, kill two survivors, but because of the huge disparity in movement it could have dragged on for the entire game if not for some lucky card draws.  Which that also annoys me, if you don't draw good cards, you aren't going to accomplish anything.  So in the end this game is a hard pass for me, maybe I might play as the heroes next times but I will never play the zombies again.

RATING: 7.5
You'll know ahead of time if you're going to like this game or not before even playing it. I'd say this is the perfect zombie game! I love the "art" on the cards, they give the game that extra bit of oomph. While the rules are solid, this is definitely an "experience" game.

edit: I don't mind being the zombie player by myself, but it sucks sharing zombie duties cuz then there's not enough to do.

edit: having all the expansions adds a lot more stuff, and therefor a lot more fun!

Rating based on one four-person play with randomly generated board -- we zombies won.  A very solid "meh" game with beautiful components.  I can see what people like about this game, but it's way too random for my taste.  The zombies got some incredibly lucky cards right at the beginning, the heroes couldn't roll dice to save their lives, and all in all it was not a game in which I felt decisions played a major role in the outcome.  The theme is great, the components are fabulous, and I can see what other people like about it, but it's not there for me.

I'm rating this a 10 on pure fun playability, yes it's not got the perfect system (but what game has) and no doubt it rubs some gamers up the wrong way. But for anyone of any age who has an inkling to chainsaw a zombie and laugh about it should play this game.

Played this loads, such a consistent good performer. Really gets a boost if you make your own characters.

Great theme, fun to play. Only played once so far- will have to see if it moves up or down with subsequent plays (I'm guessing it will stay around a 7).

Update: Have played a few times. It may just be luck of the dice, but the rolls have had a HUGE impact each game. Last time I played I got my ass kicked and the game was over in about 10 minutes, and there wasn't one thing I thought that I could have done differently. Made me remember why I don't like dice-based games. Too bad because the general idea, the theme, and components are all top-notch.

Knocked down to a 6.

Update 01/27/13: Had no desire to play this game any more. Knocked down to a 4, and traded my copy for Shogun which is awesome.

This was my gateway game believe it or not; not very traditional. I really enjoy this game, but it doesn't play well with 2 or 3. It's important for 4+ to truly enjoy this game.

Very good Zombie game. The best non coop zombie game with a great narrative aspect and a lot of tactics involved. Very different to all the Zombie slayers out there (which can be good too). At a certain point, with too many expansions, it becomes overloaded though: especially the experience system is not for me, although many people love it.

Great zombie b-movie game. Way better than "Zombies!" for example. Lots of fun....AND frustration in the first 2-3 plays, since the rulebook problably is the worst I have EVER read. It took numerous trips to the geek-forums to figure out how a lot of things actually worked. Funny thing is that the game itself is actually rather simple. So "hard to learn - easy to master" you can say.

RATING: 3
I was surprised I did not like this game. Perhaps the group simply wasn't into the mood, but it was boring.  Other players simply ran across the board, then back, the across again running away from zombies.  The cooperation and teamwork were significantly lacking and this resulted in a resounding defeat for the human players.  This may say more for the day and the group of players, but for normally loving coop games, this one fell flat for me.  Basically you can search for items in different buildings, which come up at random from the deck, move, or try to fight a zombie.  There's not actually a lot to do in this game. In addition the characters aren't interesting and there aren't very many. Arkham Horror and Pandemic put this coop to shame.

LNoE was our true gateway game - I can't remember how I came across it, but once I did, we had to have it.  We both love all things zombie (my fiance more than myself, probably) but other zombie games looked lame.  I can't imagine a more definitive zombie game than this.  Some of the scenarios are just too hard for the heroes, as killing zombies is actually pretty hard to do (at least in an offensive rather than purely defensive way), but other scenarios (like Escape in the Truck or Save the Townsfolk) have lead to many hair-raising, last turn victories.  Really great in terms of theme, and simulates the kind of narrative arc and climaxes that your favorite zombie movies have.  Munch them brains!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm a sucker for zombie games, and this is definitely one of the most thematic zombie games out there. I love the weapons, the scenarios, and the hero characters, and find the game generally hilarious. I'm not a fan of the roll-and-move mechanic and I do think it's a little boring to play the zombies, but I suppose that can't be helped. 

The pretty extensive competition (Zpocalypse, Zombicide, DDD) is giving LNOE a run for its money as far as theme and gameplay is concerned, so I'm not sure how much more I'll get to play this.

It's now a toss-up between this and Mall of Horror when it comes to my favorite zombie game.  This one is more chaotic, more crazy and more fun... as long as the group is right (interested in chaos and light roleplaying).  I died three times, and sat out the last half hour, and still had a blast.

I played this for the first time over the past weekend (early Oct. 2007) and it is, so far, the best Zombie game I've played. Now, that isn't saying much, because the Zombies! etc..

Worthy of replay.

You want the game that feels like a zombie horror movie?  This game is it.  The tension is high, what you can accomplish is limited, and you will consistently feel like you are fighting a losing battle.  For all that, it is very thematic, and a lot of fun, even as you get eaten by zombies.

Flying Frog threw in extra bonuses (including a cd full of music) that they didn't have to.  Every piece in the game is ultra durable.  They really spent a lot in all their printing costs, including with the instructional booklet.  One of the best games I've ever played.

I hate this genre of games, and this game is no different.  Run around searching for weapons, and then use them to kill zombies hitting on good rolls of a D6, and completely lose the weapon if you roll poorly.  Also interrupt peoples' moves via randomly drawn "take that" cards that you have to spend a whole turn just to draw, meaning you really don't do anything half the time.  The scenarios offer some interest, but the base mechanisms keep this one in the toilet for me.

This scores major points for theme. If this game were about any other subject, it wouldn't rank as highly for me, but the zombie theme is so well done that it more than makes up for the less than enthralling game play. The soundtrack is awful, but the fact that it  exists and was included with the game is insanely awesome.

This used to be one of our favorites but we wore it out.  After 25 or so plays the Heroes had topped the learning curve and no one could win as the Zombies.

RATING: 9
This is, by far, one of my favorite games!  Although it may start out slow, the overall effect, once combined with the expansions, is superb!  On its own, the game feels as if it's missing "something."  Despite that, it's simple enough to play, with rules that hide their complexity quite well.  

Visually, the game is great!  I could do with a less "cartoony" feel to the board, but it serves its purpose quite well.  The minis are solid, and easy to paint, which was a good thing, because the Heroes became hard to distinguish from each other during the first few game sessions.  Apply a bit of character with a brush, and suddenly, everything pops!

I would have given the game a much higher score, but the financial investment required to achieve its potential for greatness demands that I lower the score a bit.

WORD OF ADVICE:  The game is best played when using a scenario that does not require the Heroes to search through the deck for specific items.  "Defend the Manor House" has to be the best scenario the base game has to offer.

Takes the basic idea behind Zombies! but gives it the essential variety to make the game fun. And everything is dripping with horror movie cliche theme. Nailed it, in that respect.

Kind of a standard dicey American game mechanically. Some scenarios can drag, there's a lot of luck, a little fiddly. The combat is a somewhat weird but works toward the theme... if you're a hero you start to feel overwhelmed by shambling, resilient zombies pretty quickly.

Fun if you're in the right mood/with the right group.

RATING: 8

The best Zombie boardgame that I have played. Far better than "Zombies!!" IMO.

Outstanding components and despite the many rules queries on the games BGG page most rules queries can be worked out by simply reading the cards "as is".

Not hugely tactical really but it is extremely "cinematic" and you do have to make relevant decisions based on circumstances.  Every game feels like a fun blend of many b-movies, which is exactly what I want.
:)

If you like zombies and you like FUN boardgames you should own this.

We've only played this once, but the impression is that it's pretty fun. By the time I got it to the table, I forgot that it was team-competitive. That's a neat aspect though especially since I don't have a lot of team games. The sound track that came with this could be neat, we didn't get to listen to it much as the children were obnoxious. We used the TV to keep them semi-occupied while we played through the game.

I played this at gencon. The demo person was the game designer, Jason Hill. The game was fun and he really new his product. After a while I noticed the people in costume at the booth. Dr Brody (Jason's father)and Jenny the farmgirl, and Zombie were walking around the area. Everybody at the booth was connected to the game. Designer, art director, music director, models for cards. I bought it and had it signed by everyone. This game has great production value and expandability. I gave these guys a chance because they went the extra mile to produce at better product and they are a new company. Overall great product, excellent marketing at Gencon, very nice people at the booth, good sales approach. Jason and friends made a great impression on me, so my view might be a little biased. Test play it if you can, enjoy it for what it is and maybe give this new game and company a chance.

This was a disappointment on my first two plays. I found the card play quite annoying. Many of the event cards can instantly be negated by the opponents' card play.

All but one of us had fun with this game.  Unfortunately, as a human, he decided to go after the zombies on their turf, armed only with a bat.  Needless to say, he didn't fare well.  I'm [i]dying[/i] to play it again (get it? ;))

[b][u]Update[/u][/b]: Jeff played as the zombies this time and had a much better experience.  This might actually hit the table again sometime.

I love games with zombies, and trying to kill them.  I really like the LNoE series, but it tends to fall into the category of too complicated, or plays too long.  I tend to play solo games when I have the itch to play.  Pretty fun game with the right mix of people.  I prefer 3 players, 1 zombie, and then two heroes for each other player.  5 or 6 player game feels like you are doing much.  Especially if you are splitting zombies with another person.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable monster hunting game.  The general idea is to whack the zombies before they whack you.  I like it much more than Zombies! for a miniatures themed horror game.  It has a better pace than Zombies! and is less prone to wild swings of luck.  Some scenarios seem difficult for the good guys to win, but getting eaten is fun, as well!

Miserably long rule book. You have to play it three times to even understand it, and then it's got the "Betrayal" problem of being super random while having very low investment in the RP or characters. Would have been OK as an app...

4 plays (2x3p, 2x4p) -- 3x as zombie, once as hero. Fun, lucky, but more to it than just luck.  There are a lot of meaningful choices how to use the cards as well as move your forces.  I think the different strategies of the scenarios may make each experience quite different--and interesting. The basic scenario, in which zombies avoiding the humans is a reasonable strategy, made it feel unique for the ones I've played in the genre. The "Save the Townfolk" scenario poses an entirely different strategic situation. I'd like to try the other scenarios and the advanced rules. I enjoy played with 2:2 teams. It's growin' on me each time--with very close, close victory results so far--I think it's one of my favorite Ameritrashies.

Not bad for a zombie themed boardgame. The rules are balanced and don't suffer from ambiguous rules which makes a change from most boardgames. Theres not a whole lot of strategy but it does exist and doesn't detract from the fun of the game.

The CD that comes with it is fairly poor though. Its just a load of midi tracks that do nothing to add to the feel of the game.

If you are looking for a fun game that gets dragged out every so often for a change, this is it.

Love this game! I really enjoy competitive games like this. I have never played heroes and maybe have 6 plays, or more. I don't care, I love being the bad guy :) I was quite pleased; I read a bunch of reviews and got the impression the zombies were underpowered. However, these reviews seem to be written by who don't understand how to play zombies, because I have had to pull back on my strength because some of the people I play with are sore losers. Though, I haven't ever played heroes...so maybe the people I'm playing with just aren't playing them correctly. As it stands, I think the games are 40/60 heroes, but two of those games I gave away to make sure the other players didn't hate the game.

I got this on a whim after hearing it was enjoyable Ameritrash. And ... well, it's certainly Ameritrash, but only in the worst aspects of the genre. The rulebook is overly complex and very fiddly for how simple the game really is. I just didn't have fun with this any time I played it.

A decently fun game if a bit random and light. I find it works best with only one player as the zombie and one or two as the heroes. There's not enough to do for more than one zombie player and so it becomes one person making decisions and the other going along with it.

Players definitely need to be able to have fun with bad and crazy dice rolls.

The theme is great and a good variety of scenarios which truly change the game. It does feel like zombies!

P.S. The dice hate me!

This one was a pleasant surprise. Its well-themed, and holds its theme well throughout play. The rules are simple enough for easy teaching, but still providing some decision making.

This is a really fun horror survival game!

Unfortunately, I can't get enough people availible at the same time (myself included) to play, so I don't play it as much as I'd like.
This also means, I'm usually playing the Zombies, though I'd like to play the heroes every now and then.
(I find I'm secretly hoping they win each game, although I don't hold back)

The expansions help expand this game, without cluttering it with too many new rule complexities.

Nice board and bits but I think I'm too old for the American teen zombie market. Its a luck/dice fest game, although that's not a bad thing, but playing the zombies can't be much fun - just move 1 every turn 'chasing' the characters. I had a laff but can't see much game here. On the other hand, maybe good for some non-gamers and fun to play as the characters.

This game is very well balanced. Every play I've been a part of has ended up in a near toss-up on the last few rounds where the die rolls determine the victor, which is just how it should be.

RATING: 8
Almost an instant Ameritrash classic, this game is NOT an innovative, ingenious, or "clever" revision of what we've come to expect from the problematic zombie game genre- despite reports to the contrary, the game isn't a complete 180 from the type of gameplay in ZOMBIES and in fact LNoE very much resembles a "fixed" version of that game with a more reasonable scenario structure, a cooperation element, and an overall richer game experience.  Where LNoE succeeds the most is in bringing the accessibility and atmospheric narrative of BETRAYAL AT THE HOUSE ON THE HILL to the zombie genre and the result is a tremendously playable, fast-paced game that will likely have a great deal of crossover appeal and market penetration.  The rules are simple (despite some crude grammar and syntax in the rulebook), easy to teach and there is a sense of directness and immediacy that is both engaging and endearing- this is a very meat-and-potatoes game without a bunch of mechanical folderol or gaminess to get in the way of undead antics.  The modular setup is nice but restrictive, the scenarios are fun and the potential for more is great, and as a whole the game is a lot of fun particularly in its 60-80 minute duration.  I'm not a huge fan of the setting (I prefer the more urban, militaristic zombie millieu than the rural one offered by the game)and I think the artwork is absolutely awful- I'd much rather have some nice FFG-quality illustrations than photographs with slapped-on Photoshop filters).  The miniatures are nice and almost counteract the sticky, cheaply printed cards but as a whole it's a good first production for Flying Frog.  The CD is a stupid gimmick undoubtedly the result of the designer having a musician friend and frankly they should have invested that money in either a better artist, nicer production, or just knocked a couple of bucks off the MSRP.  In all, I think LNoE is an exceptional horror game and I expect that it'll be around for many years to come- it has that "X" factor that games like BETRAYAL have that guarantee that even if the NOTRE DAME set doesn't take to it, then thousands of other people will.

This is the game that got me started in boardgaming. A local comicbook shop had the game on display and after a year, I decided to buy it. I played it with a friend, a zombie film fan, and he and I loved it! I was really taken in with the cinematic feel of the game as you did get a sense that a narrative is unfolding through the use of the clever cards. I played a second time with 4 players instead of 2 players and it went well, another friend asking me where I bought the game and kept raving about it all night. I did notice that the 3rd friend, who wasn't a horror fan like the rest of us, didn't seem to like losing and the theme seemed a bit lost on him, so it's complaining of it dragged the game a bit. Since the game is obviously more geared toward losing if on the hero side (as it should be since it's akin to a horror movie), the game may not be for everyone, but for those who do like horror movies, this is great, as it really doesn't matter if you win or lose, but it's the tension and the playing which we like the most. I bought the expansion as well as I had so much fun with this game.

Based on one play of the admittedly bland introductory scenario.  I'm sure this rating will go up.

update: played the zombies in the dynamite scenario, and the game ramped up nicely and got really tense.  Great fun!  Still pretty random, and I got crappy spawning rolls, but worth playing some  more, albeit only with two, I think.

I would like 3-d doors.

The Greatest Zombie Game of All Time! This game just drips theme, zombie putrescent theme! :zombie:

The combat system has a simple elegance to it that seems to capture the spirit of a zombie movie. Simply winning a combat against zombies is not enough to kill them, but merely "fends" them off. You need to roll doubles and beat them in order to win. It really invokes an image of the heroes trying to break free of the zombies as they claw and grab at them.

The components are first class especially for the first game from a new gaming company.

I love the haters of this game and their bitching about randomness, the lack of strategy, balance issues, and that players can get in situations where they are completely out of control of their character. Seriously, what were you expecting? It is a FUCKING B-MOVIE STYLE ZOMBIE GAME! It is not trying to be Age of Steam for fucks sake! This is a game of pure theme. If you don't like to roll dice then go play Caylus. As for lack of strategy, that is bullshit. There is plenty of strategies and tactics available to the players if you can actually get past the fact that this is not a perfect information game like Puerto Rico and your carefully laid plan may fail due the that Great Satan, Randomness. As for balance and the fact that you can get into a situation beyond your control, have you actually ever watched a horror movie? That is what this is attempting to model not bloody chess!

I have been to events where this game is being played and almost everyone is laughing and hooting as their zombies get blasted and their characters eaten. While this is going on there are others nearby playing a "deep" strategy game and it is as quiet as a tomb with everyone concentrating so deeply they look constipated. I sure as hell know which table I want to be at.

Hey, I actually like games like Caylus and Puerto Rico and they are fine when I am in the mood. But, for all out zombie apocalypse fun, this is much preferred.

A couple of things I do wish for. First I wish there was more use for the Manor House. It seems to be a waste to have that whole board taken up for only one scenario. Also, with the Manor House they should included some a way to board up windows and doors.

A quibble I have is with the board shading. I was one of the first few to buy the game. I bee lined it for Flying Frog booth at Gencon '07 to make sure I got a copy. I feel as an early adopter I got screwed when they changed the shading of the new boards in the subsequent expansion. It is not that big of a deal, but it is a minor annoyance, that I feel they should have fixed on THEIR dime. I actually did consider buying the replacements boards, but with shipping it was just silly. So, now my game looks odd when you play with the boards from the base game and the expansion.

The shading on the original boards are 10 times better than the new ones. I do not know for the life of me why they would go with those new boards with the flat greenish tint.

My favorite thing about it is that it is still fun to play the game as the zombies. In fact when I play it with my friends they all fight over who gets to be the zombie player. The soundtrack is alright also but I prefer the soundtrack to Dawn of the Dead. Amazing game recomend it highly.

Effectively one play.  We played one scenario and it went so horribly wrong (zombies won in three turns) that we decided to do it again.  Decided the first experience was a bit of a 'perfect storm' for the zombies (perfect cards, dice rolls) vs. the heroes (bad rolls ... something like 8 consecutive ones, useless card draws).  Second run-through of same scenario went much better.

Overall opinion was a mixed bag ... wonderful application of theme!  Tremendous components!  Exciting moments!  But the gameplay was sluggish as we referenced the rules and FAQ multiple times.  We went WELL over the 1 hour listed time and called it around the two-hour mark when it seemed like the heroes were running away with it despite the fact that there were still something like 8 turns to go.

Experience reminded me very much of Betrayal at the House on the Hill in both a good and bad way (although the rules not NEARLY as clunky as Betrayal).  After repeated play my rating for that game went up as we understood the interaction of the game's ideas and components much better ... so I imagine with repeated play my rating for LNOE would go up a bit as well.  Especially if the play time fits into that one-hour projection.

*update* actually knocked this down a point after playing Cowboys: Way of the Gun - similar game that has all the elements I love in LNOE, and a theme I enjoy more, but it has less clunkiness.  Would rather play Cowboys.

In the first game we played so far, we just bunched the heroes in the Gun Shop... didn't seem that hard ;)  We shall see how it goes... Since the first play it has seemed fairly hard on the humans.  But of course like most humans, they usually panic in the presence of zombies and of course, die.

If your looking for a deep dark zombie game that plays much like Dawn of the Dead, please look elsewhere. IF your looking for game that plays like a B rate film on the Sci-fi channel, then this is the Best zombie game on the market, bar NONE. That said, could it be better? Well yes,.. only because of the limited scenarios. That though will be fixed in the very near future with game expansions. Add a mulligan for each player hero, and some of the zombie player, for those that want a little more control with their die rolling, and as far as I am concerned this is the ULTIMATE zombie fest game system. (That said I still enjoy Zombies!!! by twilightcreations.)

Last Night on Earth has some flaws, but is a very enjoyable game. It's not so heavy that my family is turned off by it, and comes with different scenarios to help the game feel fresh.

My biggest problem is down time. If you play as the zombies, your turn will usually go by quickly, but the heroes will take forever. Not just that, but the game is usually very one-sided in my experience and, depending on your choice of scenario, decently luck driven.

All in all, it is an enjoyable game and I will happily play it with my family.

'Last Night' can be hilarious if in the right mood and with the right people. Otherwise, it is close to a pure dicefest. This get at least 2 bonus points for the fun theme.

Game play weight can be adjusted upwards through use of advanced rules, scenarios, and cards added to the deck. None of us had played it before and the first two games were won by a landslide, but by the third game we had got the hang of it and had a right good time with the advantage swinging back and forth repeatedly.

When you're in the mood for a cooperative game but don't have the time for Arkham Horror, this is the game for you.  It's relatively light, moves fast, and is worth a lot of laughs.

Players work either on the zombie side or the human side in various scenarios, each with their own goals.  The Humans are generally trying to defeat a certain number of zombies in a given timeframe, while the zombies try to run out the clock.  Each side draws from a deck of special cards, as the players try to outmaneuver each other.  ("My zombie uses a Shamble card to race towards Sally."  "Cancel a zombie action!")

This offers just enough strategy and tension to satisfy your average gamer, but remains light enough to bring in beginners to the hobby.  Thumbs up for a game I'd gladly play whenever it's offered.

For some reason, this game was difficult for me to 'grok'.  As the owner of the game, and the main instructor for all games I've played, I have always been the zombie player.  For the first five games I was soundly beaten.  After a fairly lengthy hiatus, I introduced it to my brother-in-law and finally had that 'ah ha' moment.  Heroes with weapons are bad.  Get rid of them with Zombie cards.  I had almost written this one off as a trade, but am now eager to play the base game a bit more, after which I will start adding in the expansions I own.

I love this B movie theme.  It works well and is fun.  It's cheesy.  However, I do wish the weapons were not quite so good if they are able to be kept.  I feel like the game breaks with the B movie theme when it lets weapons be kept from kill to kill.

Don't waste your money, even if it costs 50p. Unless you need something cheap to put on your fire!

I had more fun at the dentist having root canal work done.

You spend a whole lot of time doing not very much at all. I endured 11 turns out of 17 before giving up. Have played it twice, will not bother play it again. The players who were the zombies had more fun, but there was more for them to do, the heros had very little to do.

I'm baffled by how many high ratings this game has gotten. It is a basic move-the-mini and roll-the-dice game. This same, basic mechanic is in a slew of other games, and doesn't garner nearly as many 9s and 10s. Has everyone affiliated with the game flooded the ratings area, or are the pictures of hot babes enough to satisfy love-starved gamers?

I have nothing against the game, but I can't imagine how someone can be so taken by such a simplistic system. Something doesn't smell right with all those high ratings, and it isn't rotting flesh.

While being fun, if playing with the right type of people, this game suffers from being too card driven. Some games will be pretty easy to win, if drawing the right cards at the right time, others will prove far more difficult. 
It has very high production value and thus tons of atmosphere. But it lacks serious tactical/strategic decisions due to it's card driven nature.

A modern zombie classic for the more casual gamer - and a true hit in our household.  

Last Night on Earth is THE GAME that reintroduced me to board games after a many yeared lay off.  As such, it is also THE GAME that introduced my daughters to the true joys of the hobby. 

If there is going to be a world beyond Dog-opoly and Mille Bournes, let it be populated by brain hungry zombies.    

Flying Frog Productions has to be one of the more thematic of game publisher/designers in this new Golden Age of board gaming.  In this, their first game, the Frog absolutely nails the dread of Romero flavored zombie movies.

I've only played one game so far, as the Heroes, but I must say I'm impressed.  They captured the theme very well, and the pacing seems just right.

Great game; thematically very strong; very simple rules for a game with this depth; replayability is very good because of availability of many scenarios, with different characters and board set-ups to choose from; even playing the same scenario twice will offer two different games; there is a luck factor in the game (dice rolling) but it is a challenge to minimize luck; good game length

Fun team-based zombie game (zombies vs. humans).  I think it really nails the theme and is a good beer-and-pretzels style game.

This can be so hard to win for the heroes, but it's a zombie apocalypse, it's not supposed to be easy. Of course once in a while you get Johnny with a Baseball Bat and the Chainsaw going to town on all the helpless zombies...

RATING: 8
Last Night on Earth is based on B-Zombie Horror Movies like Dawn of the Dead, Zombieland, and so on. You either play as the townsfolk heroes trying to survive the zombie apocalypse or the zombies trying to eat and kill said heroes. This game is a lot of fun to play and I had a "Heart of the Cards" moment when the heroes were about to escape and I played the "A Town Overrun" card which made the heroes deck lose ten cards and if there were no more cards in the hero deck they lost so I won that way. It has tons of expansions from what I've seen so it has lots of replay value but it still has replay value in the base game too. Also it has a cd with it that you can run in the background while playing the game which gives a much creepier atmosphere to the game.  For a zombie survival game, you can't really go wrong with Last Night on Earth.

RATING: 7
This can be a lot of fun if you are willing to get into the story you are creating. Not for everyone, and not all that often, but we've had a few games that were a blast.

I thought I would hate the cheesy photography, but really it doesn't matter and you don't even notice it while playing.  The actual artwork on the board is kind of shabby though.

Still, the game itself is actually quite fun to play, even as the zombies.  There are enough different scenarios to keep things interesting, and I'll definitely be picking up some expansions at some point.

Much better than Zombies!!!, plays a bit faster and simpler than Zombicide.  Glad to have it in my collection.

Mechanically, it's just a mini's skirmish game with event cards. But the theme is so effective that it often evokes a zombie B-movie reel in your mind's eye, taking the simple gameplay to the next level.

RATING: 5.8
The theme is wonderful and leads to all kinds of cinematic B-movie moments (Billy makes his last stand against a horde of zombies in the bank with nothing but a blowtorch!). The copious amounts of die-rolling and the multiple reversals that the cards bring about (We won! - No, this card makes you lose! - Oh yeah, well this card cancels your card! - Oh yeah, well this card makes you lose your weapon, so there!) can get a little tedious. 

Theme is a bit plus, the mechanics not so much.

I'm interested in trying it out with more players, and delve into the complex rules and other scenarios.

Good luck peeling the cards apart without damaging them.  The game is one of the better zombie games I've played, but that really isn't saying much now is it?  Good production (apart from the cards that are sealed together).  The CD is a nice touch, but I think I would've preferred a cheaper game with no CD.  I remember feeling that this was expensive for what I received, and I frequently purchase GMT wargames, and I am pleased with those.  Go figure.

Cute and humorous, similar in feel to Descent but much quicker.  Some of the cards can really unbalance the game though.  In our first game, the Heroes got a card that allowed them to dive through the deck for the items they needed... twice!  And zombies got a card that wiped out all but one of the zombies on the board in one fell swoop.  This randomness is really the biggest complaint, but at least it's quick!

>This can really be more fun than it rightfully should be for having such a large amount of randomness. 

 A very simple game, but I've found it to be a lot of fun so far. The zombie movie feel works great (a bit more cheesy than Romero though). I could see the randomness taking some of the fun from the odd game, but nothing a couple of simple tweaks shouldn't fix. Another game (like Arkham Horror) that definitely has to be played with the right people who can deal with the randomness as part of the narrative of the game.
 Lots of options for creating your own scenarios.

Not really my kind of game, but I'd rather play this than most of its genre brethren.  Got my prom queen buffed up (or is that "Buffyed up," ha ha) with some combat bonuses and went around slaughtering zombies while the other characters finished off the mission requirements, which was kinda fun, but the game to that point wasn't terribly thrilling.

One of the local gang has really souped up his LNoE set with tons of extra minis and homebrew characters and scenarios, which helps.

The player cards are about the only interesting thing in this game and the characters and plots feel like they have been pulled right from a movie which is cool. Every card or roll that you play has a number of conditions attached to it where by you will be picking up the rule book every 2 seconds to verify the validity of certain moves.

But finding the rules for every particular situation is only a problem for your first few games the main issue is balance.

The mechanics of the spawning and the balance of the cards do not work very well and often lead to uneven games. Heck 1 game I played finished halfway through the first turn.

RATING: 8
Wow! Zombie killing goodness. When I played this for my first time, I really had a ball. I've seen other reviews that downplay the game because of the random factor, but I really enjoyed it. There were some complaints from the zombie player that this game was unbalanced in favor of the townsfolk, but then the zombies ended up winning on the last turn. It seemed to me that the game truly could have gone either way the whole time, and that makes for a good game. (IMPORTANT NOTE: the character of Father Joseph, equipped with a Faith card AND the pitchfork, is a zombie killing machine!)  Anyway, bottom line is that I really liked this game. I guess that maybe I really am an Ameritrasher, after all. Oh well - A little randomness never hurt anyone. Embrace the dice!  Love the dice!
BTW, the components are absolutely awesome looking. All the artwork on the cards is glossy photo quality, and lends an air of "realism" to the game.
A final bonus, for me - it can be played two player. (And my wife likes it!)

This was traded away, not because I didn't like it, but because it just wasn't played enough.  Plus, I grew weary of the whole zombie/occult theme.

RATING: 7
A really clever, polished, and enjoyable team human vs zombie survival horror game. Extremely modular and with tons of room for home brewed expansions. I highly recommend picking up at least Survival of the Fittest, as it greatly expands the number of options/actions both humans and zombies can do on their turns.

fun game. not heavy on strategy or thinking, but a good game to have in the collection for times when you only have light gamers around. I'd certainly rather play this than most of the games the light game crowd wants to bring out. Feels like you are in a zombie movie.

This is a great co-op game because if the heroes don't work together, they will die.  Almost every time.  It's hard to beat them if they're working together.

I find more than one person running the zombies is a bit redundant, but it is nice to have one more person to help strategize.

I also love the artwork.  There is something about getting actors to take stills of the characters being played that adds a bit more.

RATING: 6
Players represent townsfolk cooperating to fight off a plague of zombies, or the zombies themselves.  Scenario driven game where players are trying to complete objectives (destroy 15 zombies, get the truck started and get out of here, etc) while trying to stay alive.  The zombie player(s) are trying to deny victory, or kill off two townsfolk.  Game mechanics are simple and intuitive - basically move/search then fight.  Combat is a bit like History of the World - roll a bunch of dice and highest single roll is your result.  Event and item cards spice things up.  Wonderful components, from the sturdy variable game boards, miniatures, cards and counters.  Looks like actors/models were hired for a zombie photo shoot for the components and the results are great.  I enjoyed this game much more than I was expecting - a zombie game where you are faced with real choices.  Good stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Perhaps it's the Risk-like battle system. Maybe it's the fact the zombies are pretty much built to have the upper hand. Maybe it's the fact that all games seem to end up coming down to whether the survivors are lucky enough to have a good gun or chainsaw high up in the hero deck. Maybe I'm playing it wrong, but right now I don't want to play it at all. Great art and theme, though.

Highly recommended as the best of the American-style action boardgames. Amazing component quality and well-executed rules, which is often a challenge for a start-up outfit. Challenging for the heroes and not boring on the Zombie player either. Better and more action-heavy than Arkham Horror or many similar search-and-shoot games.

The best zombie game, ever (and probably the only one you need). It really captures the feel of the genre, while giving you strategic control over your horde of zombies, or your stereotypical protagonists. The scenarios and extra player characters should give this sufficient replay value.

A B-movie about zombies in boardgame form.  The heroes get stereotypical movie weapons (up to and including duct taping a shotgun to a chainsaw), while the zombie player can force the heroes to act in stereotypical zombie movie fashion ("Let's split up!", twisted ankles, etc.).

Better in theory than in reality. It's almost like I like the idea of it better than I actually like to play it. The theme is great, the components are good, but it never really lifts off.

I was initially put off by the die rolls and cards that modify die rolls and cards that modify cards that modified die rolls; but I've warmed up to it now. Suffers from same problem as all "cooperation" games: someone will "play" your hero turn for you. For that reason, better with fewer players IMHO. Also, *don't* play the basic scenario: the game needs the 'bump' provided by the scenarios. Much better with the expansion. UPDATE: Ok, fine. You can't get a much better light 6-player interactive zombie game than this.

I liked last night on earth, but in the end I just didn't like how the number of players ended up working. In most player configurations someone always has to play a second character, which is cumbersome and takes away from the game. If you can get the optimal number of players (5 I think) Its a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game does a good job of putting you in a small town in an earlier time. It feels like a poorly made movie and your the bad actors. The character are well designed and there are multiple game modes.This game hits our table probably once a month and I think that is about fine. The zombie team can dominate some maps if they play their cards right, or if they pull great cards in their starting hands. At times the game can seem unfair on both sides which is why I have not rated it higher. It's a fun tacky horror game, but not everyone's first choice on game night.

Good, but not great, take on the zombie genre.   I'm actually not convinced that there is a GREAT game in this genre, but LNOE tries.   On the plus side, it offers co-op (team) play, and a variety of different scenarios and unique characters.  It has lots of the right tone.   On the minus side, it's still just roll to move, roll to attack, play action cards.   The zombies seem a little bit too hard to kill.   They are zombies, right?  I think I prefer the ZOMBIES!!! game with Quick Play rules, since the card play is a little more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A good zombie game. Not perfect, though. I love the components, but some of the mechanics feel off. And I wish it had a solo variant, but the zombie cards make that near impossible if not completely impossible. 

Playing the zombies is just not much fun.  In fact, this game encourages me to avoid other one-versus-many games. Well, LNOE is really more of a team game than one versus many, but there is absolutely no point in having multiple zombie players.

The search mechanic is tedious, but it seems to be par for the course in zombie survival games, unfortunately.

RATING: 2
This game looked like so much fun when it was featured on “Table Top” that when someone brought it to a game meet, I enthusiastically looked forward to playing it.  Wow, what a disappointment!  We just felt like we were going round and round in circles rolling dice hoping to hit the right numbers.  That’s basically what the game comes down to.  It calls itself a cooperative game, but it sure didn’t feel like it.  One player got eliminated and basically was sitting around twiddling his thumbs, while two other remaining characters were pent up in a corner and getting pummeled by Zombies.  I was successfully holding up my corner of the board (basically its down to lucky dice rolls, that’s all) and then our DM (I mean this really is just a role-playing game but without any good story to keep you interested) asked me if I would like to go over and help my teammates out.  I looked at the guy sitting in the corner twiddling his thumbs and replied to her, ‘hell no!  I might get myself killed doing that!’  As far as I was concerned, this was a last man standing game.  
Seriously, go play “Zombies!!!” if it’s the theme you are looking for.  That game plays faster and I remember enjoying it much better than this thing.  At least in that game you feel like you are building the board Carcassonne-style, exploring places and have more options on each turn as to what direction you want to go.  “Last Night on Earth” just drags on for way too long and you are running around and around in circles on a relatively small board.

This is a bloody thematic game. I'm a big fan of anything zombie so I may be biased. I own so much expansions and painted my minis that I end up selling everything for the reason that I don't have players to play with and also time.

You spend most of the time reading the cards and if you don't play it enough; checking the rulebook if you get it right.

Another of our favourites, and one that I can never seem to beat my wife at. Whether she plays the heroes or zombies, she's a much better player than I am. 

We both love zombie movies, and I think we love the game so much because it feels like a movie, the tension gets ratcheted up the further you get into the game. LNoE has never failed to impress new gamers, though they are a bit overwhelmed at first. The campy cards and variable hero powers usually draw them in. 

We have far, far more plays than is indicated.

RATING: 6
A pretty good game marred by a horrid rule book and card text.  We had so many questions after our first two playings that we had to start a long list and begin hunting for answers.  The card text just isn't sufficient to answer simple questions that pop up. Really, most of these questions should have been obvious to the writer and included in the earliest drafts of the rule book. The others should have popped up during the earliest playtests and been incorporated into the rules long before the game went to print. More time should have been spent on this than on the fancy photos etc. since the rules themselves are absolutely necessary to play the game. All that aside, I still have fun playing this one. It's rich in theme and can get quite tense.  I'd have probably given it a 7.5 or an 8 with tighter rules and card text.

Love the zombie survival theme and the design of the components. So much goodness in a box, especially soundtrack CD, which was a nice touch.
Really fun at the beginning but then on the half-way focuses a lot on the meta gaming which ruins all the fluff of the theme. It's a small but crucial flaw in the design.

This is definitely the best zombie game out.  I really like the coop nature of this game (even though one person does have to be the zombies), and once you learn the rules (which can be very long and daunting the first time you play) the game flows well.  The only thing bad about this game is that most of your strategy (other than just killing the zeds and trying to stay alive) will be dictated by the cards you draw while looting, which is largely based on luck.  So, sometimes the game will be extremely hard (if you draw and roll like crap) OR, sometimes you will wipe the zeds out with no problem at all.  Either way, I still think the game is really fun, and it even comes with an immersive cd with spooky tunes to get your game on.

RATING: 5
I had serious problems rating this game. My one game wasn't so bad (maybe a bit long - the scenario lasted 17 turns), it had fun moments, it had also frustrating moments. For this single game I would give a game '6' rate. But on the other hand it's such a dice fest which I hate. I know I would never play LNOE again if there is something else on the table (maybe except Lost Cities :D). 
I used revolver (hits on 4+ - 50% of a chance) and missed first 4 times loosing the weapon on the last shot. Then I fought bare-handed and killed 3 zombies throwing doubles. Zombies won the game in the last turn - a coincidence with drawing perfect card and rolling perfect result on dice - only '6' helped and it was rolled. Too much of a luck factor for my taste.

The rating is an average based on 6 for my single game and the 3 - don't want to play it again. 

Note: I played it all together with the expansion "Growing Hunger" - haven't played only basic game.

Excellent board game. Was pleasently surprised. Looking forward to playing this game with the family to see if it's their kind of board game.

Good game to play during Halloween. I enjoy the theme of Last Night on Earth. Different scenarios comes with the game. Also, basic rules and advance rules. Components looks nice. Hero vs. Zombies! Who will win?

Looking into getting the expansion if this game gets played more often.

This rating is based on 1 play. The first thing is that I definitely want to play this game again. You get to either be survivors or zombies. The first game I was a zombie and I'm just not sure how winnable. I'd like to play again and find out. Very fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Oozes theme. The components do a great job of adding feel to what would otherwise be a fairly abstract dice-heavy game. Zombies seem fairly ineffectual at first, but some of the Zombie Event cards make them very nasty. The Heroes don't stand a chance of ever winning a scenario unless they get good weapons early.  It's the best zombie game I've ever played (but admittedly that's faint praise).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Good.  A nice light game, although still heavy on rules for non-gamers.  The theme is top-notch and the team gameplay makes for some nice competition.  Great bits and hilarious stereotypes fill out the zombie-movie experience.

However ... the game really needs a streamlined, total reworking by a skilled developer.  The guys at Flying Frog have a great handle on theme and production, but their game-design inexperience shows.  A lot of the rules for weapons are inconsistent (most guns you roll after attacking to see if you're out of ammo, but the pistol is out if the attack roll is a one, etc.) and the other weapons have seemingly random effects that have little connection to the theme -- and in a game that is so reliant on theme, this is crippling.

This is not a gaming masterpiece - usual beer & pretzel randomness is ruling the gameboard - but regarding theme and execution this is a big step up from the awful "Zombies!!!" game by Twilight Creations. Here the cooperative factor keeps everybody involved until the end, and also makes more sense thematically. A big plus is the number of scenarios provided and the general great eye candy quality of the components (I really like the "actors" that portray the characters - much better than the usual computer images so common nowadays). The music CD is an unusual bonus, but we found the music extremely unimaginative and grating, also not really fitting to the theme (I think Zombies just need "The Gonk"), but well, it's a gift that some might enjoy more than me.
Good for having a laugh, that's for sure. And the Zombies usually win.

The movement is cleverly done, and I kinda enjoyed the team play.  The rules really give the game the right thematic feeling.  On the hero side, you feel as if your lives are fragile and precious.  You feel that the odds are against you, and you must be bold and wily to survive.  On the zombie side, you feel no individuality or cleverness, just a blind will to devour everything in your path.

Best of the zombie games thusfar, but that isn't necessarily saying much.  The game is good, but in our first play we had a very tight, tense, fun game going.  Then, right at the end, the 'citizens' got two cards that threw the victory into their laps with absolutely nothing the zombie player could do to stop it.  Sucked the fun right out of the game for both sides.  We didn't play it again for months as a result.  However, our second game much later was a blast. Another close game with a narrow 'citizen' victory.  With a lively bunch the game is a blast to play.

RATING: 10
There's something about Last Night on Earth that scratches every single gaming itch I have. It's zombie-themed, for starters, and unlike Zombies!!! it's actually a lot of fun to play. The gameplay itself isn't terribly deep; most of the rules can be explained in five or ten minutes and there's an extremely helpful "rules summary" card printed for each player. But this also makes it perfect for a pickup-and-play game since you almost never have to refer back to the rulebook. I do think it's fairly ridiculous that some people complain about the length of the FAQ, because 99% of the time the correct answer to rules questions/card interactions is the obvious one. Perhaps some of that comes from my CCG background; but even the inexperienced shouldn't have too much difficulty their first time playing.

Last Night on Earth is also immensely fun. Players' turns are fast and furious, but there's a fair amount of tactical planning required as well. If you don't plan with the rest of your team, you're going to end up alone in an abandoned building with a swarm of zombies about to overtake you. I write that from the Heroes' perspective since we only ever assign one person to be the zombie player. LNoE's rulebook suggests using 2 zombie players when you have 4 or 6 people, but I think the game then loses quite a bit of enjoyment on the zombies' end. There simply isn't enough to do in order to justify splitting the zombies and their cards in two. Five players is really the maximum for Last Night on Earth--four heroes and one zombie. And that also happens to be the game's sweet spot, although I've had just as much fun with 2-4.

Combat is dice-based, but there are enough modifiers and special abilities in the game that both zombies and humans can significantly affect the outcome if they wish. Having said that, however, I can't count the number of times everything has hinged on a crucial die roll. And a player picks up a die and tosses it across the table, the cheering and yelling can be quite intense. I think that's one of Last Night on Earth's strengths: everything works to draw you into the game and become emotionally involved. This isn't one to play passively or quietly.

One of the brilliant things about LNoE is the scenario system. This, more than anything else, is what keeps the game endlessly fresh. Some of the scenarios have a similar feel, but there are enough crazy ones to keep the replay value extremely high. Right now I have a total of 11 scenarios in the game box (base game + Growing Hunger + all of the expansions). Some favor the heroes; some favor the zombies. But even if you only play each scenario several times, there's no way you're going to get tired of LNoE anytime soon.

When I first started playing, I thought the zombies had a bit of a disadvantage compared to the Heroes. Even trying my hardest, the Heroes were winning every single game, often quite easily. But then things flipped; for several games in a row the zombies were dominant. But as players figured out some of the nuances in the game (yes, they are there), the win ratio is now roughly 50-50. You can't think like a hero when you're playing the zombies, and vice versa. It also helps having a general idea of what kinds of cards are in your deck; I didn't immediately realize that the zombie player should be cycling as many cards as possible every turn to draw the ones needed. In contrast, unless the heroes need specific items for the scenario (Escape in the Truck or Burn 'Em Out!, for example) you'll want to hold onto your best cards for when they're most needed.

Last Night on Earth also has some amazing production values, comparable to anything Days of Wonder or Fantasy Flight puts out. The hero miniatures are extremely well-detailed; the modular boards (even the lighter ones) are a lot of fun to play on, and the filtered photography on all of the cards looks extremely impressive. I know there are those that would prefer actual illustrations instead of photos, but I really like the effect that Flying Frog went for--it fits the horror movie theme perfectly. (I think it works slightly less well on A Touch of Evil, but that's a different story).

In nearly all of our games now, the scenario isn't won or lost until the final turn or two. This causes a lot of tension when we play since it's never obvious who's going to win. And the narrative structure of the game lends itself so well to telling stories about your experiences with LNoE; I don't know how often we've been playing a different game when someone pipes up with "Remember the time when the sheriff sacrificed himself to lure some zombies away from the farmhouse? Then Jenny moved six spaces across the board and threw a fire extinguisher into the farmhouse to push all of the zombies left in there outside so Sally could run in with the weapons. Oh wow, that was fun!"

People genuinely love this game. It's fast-paced, thematic, tactical, and deliciously tense. Last Night on Earth has become one of my favorite games to play, and I don't expect to grow tired of it for a long time to come (perhaps never, if Flying Frog keeps releasing expansions). That is one downside, though; a $50 base game quickly becomes $150 after all of the expansions and extra zombies--with more on the way. But I gave up on the Battlelore system a long time ago, and I've gladly handed over the title of "King of the Expandable Game" to Flying Frog. 

[b]Edit[/b]: There is one bad thing about LNoE: the soundtrack CD that comes with the game. It's unfortunately one of those things that's great on paper but poor in execution. I love the idea of having a soundtrack; it really fits in well with LNoE's desire to be an immersive gaming experience. But the CD comes across as rather hokey and kind of boring. I applaud Flying Frog's efforts; but neither this game nor A Touch of Evil really needs its own soundtrack.

I've had some epic sessions of LNOE, and it remains a game that I enjoy playing on occasion for the memorable moments it creates. The game does an amazing job creating the experience of being in your own zombie movie. Throw in a touch of roleplaying and you can have a blast.

We have memories of a character sacrificing themself so others could get away -- and then fighting off a hoard with incredible die rolls and surviving. [i]Surprised to see me? I couldn't let you guys have all the fun.[/i] Or two characters sharing a special moment in spite of the advancing threat. [i]Here, let me show you how to hold this gun. [/i] Or the bickering b*tch fight between two teens. [i]No, YOU'RE a slut![/i] It's a house rule that you have to say your character's catch-phrase at least once, and you have to yell, [i]I'll see you in hell![/i] when throwing the dynamite. 

It's a fragile design, for sure, and you can have some wipeouts. Especially annoying is the roll-for-movement, but these flaws don't override the fact that you can have epic sessions with this game unlike any other -- zombie game or not. I highly recommend The Growing Hunger expansion for the additional elements it offers and the point balancing system. A must-have if you're going to invest in this gaming system.

Understandably, this game was well promoted at the recent cons, and the theme is a traditional one that has a considerable fan base. Regardless the game mechanics are the stuff of true nightmares. Near every aspect of the game relies on dice and randomness. Initally this doesn't seem to bother the early adopters of these types of games, but eventually the bloom fades and people realize what they have, another dicefest-hangover.

I've been in recovery from many similar episodes, and having been treated to a few rounds by a friend who caved in and bought this, I will live to see many more nights on this earth than LNOE will.

We gave it another shot, the dice rolling was painful...

If you're crazy about zombies, this game won't disappoint.  It really conveys the theme extremely well.  I just don't find it consistently exciting.  Several times throughout the game I think you'll run into some interesting moments, but I feel like spend 80% of the time watching other people roll dice and then on my turn I end up doing something like draw a card.  Never split the zombie player, either.  It's boring enough as-is.

Goofy B-movie horror.  No good with two, three, or four in my experience.  Can occasionally be lots of fun with five. 

Played one game that culminated in an incredible ending where the humans were holed up in the same building, dramatically fending off a hoard of zombies just as dawn approached. Two humans were dragged from the building to be eaten alive, but just when the situation seemed bleakest, a surprise flame-thrower and a lucky roll allowed the survivors to hold on just long enough to see daylight. That game ended in a ragged roar of screaming and cheers and I think that's how I'd like every board game in this genre to end. That alone tempts me to bump the rating, but every other play that's ended with  unspectacular results keeps it down.  

Still, decent to break out around Halloween. It's not a good game, but from time to time it captures a good story-telling moment.

A fun, atmospheric and fairly tactical little game, LNoE does a fair old job keeping you entertained for an evening.

Perfectly catches the aesthetic of a schlocky B-movie zombie flick, but is so horribly unbalanced in favor of the zombies.

Splitting up the zombie's side into 2 players is entirely unnecessary.

The theme ties very well into the game and the bits are nice. I LOVE the artwork.
What I didn't like is that the card drawing mechanism broke the game for us (Truck scenario). The one card we needed (of which there were two in the deck) to make our escape were the fourth from las and last. This means, no matter how well we (Heroes) played, we couldn't have won. That was frustrating for me.

If the zombie player acts more like a DM than a player, and enhances the rules a little for more difficulty e.g. zombie dogs, zombie movement, super zombies, this game is incredible.

Received from Secret Santa in 2010.  The rules are well done, and the theme is interesting.  I find the art and the minis to be entertaining.  This received the coveted "We'll play that again" from my wife after our first game resulted in zombie massacre of two of her heroes who had holed up in the high school.

Recently this game worked well as a couples game, hero husbands vs. zombie wives.  Of course the good guys won, and after learning the rules the scenario we played (Escape in the Truck) moved pretty fast.

Many say this is the best zombie game of all. I disagree... it is the best boardgame period. Incredible design and ton of add-on stuff. Replayability limits... only limited by imagination. Plays well and always makes for a night of fun with my group when it comes off the shelf.

Own everything there is for the game. 12 out of 10, but the ratings don't go that high!

For the player who doesn't mind sacrificing determinism and the surgical cleanliness of Eurogames for light hearted romp through zombies (if one may indeed 'romp' through zombies), then this game is a must have.  Just remember: the more you say 'braaaaaiinns', the more fun you will have!

It's a great game (especially for the hero-players), but the poor zombie player(s) sometimes just have to play the pawns for the heroes. While in the beginning the zombies were overwhelming, the game got more and more balanced as the players get to knew it and now we use house rules to strengthen the zombie player(s). We give them more play options by giving them more cards to draw, a reduced zombie spawn threshold, the ability to convert multiple zombies into one zombie hero, etc.

RATING: 7.5
A good basic game which captures the feel of zombie movies very well. Flawed by poorly written rules. There are two sources of randomness - cards and dice. The dice mechanic is very similar to Risk and the card play is similar to CCG's. The only mechanic in the game I dislike is the roll and move aspects of the game. Usually this applies only to the human player, the zombies always move one unless a card is played granting them additional movement. The scenario structure gives a variety of game play possibilities. Look forward to playing again.

RATING: 6
I really don't want to shit on this game because zombie games are a good idea and the production value on this is pretty solid. Regardless, LNOE is very theme-driven, with the entire game being decided largely on random dice rolls and random card draws. You really have to get into the story of it in order to gloss over the fact that this is no different than Risk-style mechanics. Sure, it's not trying to be anything greater than what it is (a zombie-killing love-fest) but ultimately I feel that it is the random elements that completely decide the game rather than any input of mine in terms of strategy or meaningful decisions. A game like this should be able to balance strategy and luck through a selection of meaningful choices and ways to mitigate bad luck in a planned fashion. That rather large point aside, it still works as a tense game.

tentative score based one one play with basic rules.  Potential here, has the ability to rise in score with the advanced rules and more involved scenarios.

UPDATE:  Upped the score to an 8.  Having watched Romero's original Night of the Living Dead the night before, and then playing the manor house scenario, I was surprised how thematic the game truly felt.  Yes, there are those odd rule quirks (that exist in all dice games) but overall LNoE provides a fun experiential game with solid enough game play and tension that it doesn'y bog down and become another Zombies!!!

Team game. Some game play options seem to make it to easy, hope they changed the cards from the 1st edition that I played but if not the cards have a weird coating on them that makes them stick together :P Is a bit simple for experienced gamers but something you can play with new board gamers. Not a lot of replayability even though there are a bunch of different scenarios.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Echo echo...  We love this game! The whole thing comes together very well for a great zombie bashing (or human munching) time by all who have played. After a handful of games I can say this one will definitely be hitting the table many times for years to come. This game does not replace TWC Zombies!!! for us, it does not replace Betrayal at House on the Hill for us, it also does not replace Zombie Plague for us, but it does seem to merge very well the different aspects of those games that we really seem to love! I like the expandability, the scenario mechanic, the artwork (I'm a b-movie junkie too), the game flow and timeframe designed into the game. 

The only real gripe I have is with the cards. I like the art and all, but those suckers were almost glued together. Luckily I had read on here about slightly flexing and twisting the deck and they all seemed to come apart ok. We had a couple in the zombie deck that the plastic delaminated a little on (no biggie) and the top card of one of the decks was actually not sitting square on the stack when they were shrink wrapped so it got creased over the edge a bit. I think the heat from that evil shrink wrap is what caused the plastic coated cards to stick together like that.

After getting into the scenarios more and seeing how the support for the game goes I will re-visit this rating and see if it goes up or down a point. You see, it can only go as high as a 10, which with good support and growth of the game from the publisher, it should. If it doesn't get supported and goes stale it still deserves no lower than an 8 from us for what it offers as is.

RATING: 2
I think that second to Nightfall, Last Night on Earth is the 2nd worst game I've ever played. Mechanically it's very similar to Betrayal at House on the Hill (which I also dislike a great deal), but characters only have 1 or 2 hit points before they die. There are no meaningful decisions here, it's just roll the dice, draw a card and maybe roll the dice again with no way to mitigate bad dice rolls at all.

While I understand that this game is meant to be more thematic than mechanic, there just doesn't seem to be any real substance here as there aren't any meaningful decisions to be made. You roll the dice, move to a spot where the zombies hopefully can't get to you, then wait. Then the zombies either don't get to you so you do it again, or they do get to you and you roll more dice to find out if you get hit or not. Most of our game was trying to just stay out of the way of the zombies while the one character with a ranged weapon tried to kill them one-by-one. How is this supposed to be fun? I just don't understand...

Tried it twice.  Both times was struck by the limited agency the players have.  The game moves at the pace of a zombies shamble.  There were a few interesting moments, but all-in-all I was fairly unimpressed.  It felt like a single scenario from "Betrayal at House on the Hill" played over and over with slight variation and little dynamism.

Tide shifts quickly.  Not a fan of some of the scenarios though.  I think playing as a hero is more fun.

After a few more games tonight controlling the zombies alone in three-player games, I enjoyed this much more.  It swings from feeling unbalanced in favour of the zombies to being too player-friendly.  Looking forward to playing this again.

RATING: 8
This game combines a cooperative game (the hero players work together) with a competitive game (one or two players play the zombies) that uses interesting card play by zombies and heroes to simulate the feeling of playing out the events in a zombie horror movie. Each hero has their own special abilities which provides variety, the game comes with five different scenarios each with a different set of victory conditions, and the game board, which represents the small town that is being overrun by the zombies, is modular and randomly constructed at the beginning of each game. Dice rolling is the core mechanic here, for both movement of heroes and combat, but taken in it's entirely the game really oozes theme, has great replay value, and is fun. To add to the horror movie theme the box includes a CD of original, appropriately ominous, music to accompany the game as you play.

This game has a couple of characteristics that turn me off. I don't appreciate scenario based games and games with asymmetrical roles (horde of zombies vs a few heroes).

in my opinion, one of the best zombie games out there. I would give to it an 8 even with only the vanilla things , but my final vote is 9 cause of expansions pack that I greatly reccomend for this game, giving to it lot's of variety and deepness. Last night on Earth is a semicooperative zombie games, one of the fews that gives to a player the role of the zombies trying to kill the little group of survivors trying to struggle for their lives. This is a scenario based zombie game in wich survivors must complete specifical tasks while trying to survive the hordes of zombies infected by an unknown source. the game also features a modular  L shaped based board in which at the center we have a square and at the corners we have the L shaped boards that are randomly placed in order to create a different map for every playthrough. LNOE also features scavenging sistems and with expansions you will even face different tipes of special zombies(like in every respectfull game of this genre)and even barricades sistems. recommended with 5 players, but also enjoyable with less, even with 2 players

Simple enough zombie game to play with non-gamers, and a perfect pairing for a Halloween get together.  A light hearted take on all of those cheesy horror classics.  The zombie cliches are all there, just as they should be.  Mechanically I like Zombicide better, particularly since the zombies are not autonomous in the game so someone has to be the bad guy.

I really dislike how items and events are all mixed together as something you "find". Really stupid simplification that makes no physical sense and confused me.

Also, dislike how zombies can pass through walls -- the fun of zombie survival is barricading!

The game is a blast and a half. There isn't all that much strategy, and luck plays a huge part in the game.
But the experience is spectacular. You'll have stories to tell after each game. The game also fits different numbers of players simply and elegantly. And it plays fast and furious.
In some ways this reminds of what Descent could have been if it were shorter, simpler, and more balanced.

If you are a fan of b-movie zombie flicks then find a few more people that are and play this game. All the cliche's are here (I won't spoil them for you), the game is well produced with modular game boards and over a dozen different scenarios out of the box. The game is largely card driven and uses dice for combat, so if your friends don't want to play a game where there is any luck in the game just tell them to stay home and calculate PI to a few more digits instead of having fun. :)  This is one of the few games that women like to play too so that might scare off some of the recluse gamers (warn them in advance). :)  My rating might go up to 10 on this one but I want to have a chance to play more games of this with different groups of different sizes.

This game is good when you are playing with 4 other people and are all really into it, and are making some amount of intelligent moves (on both sides' parts, including the brain dead zombie player's).

I love the Zombie game/movie genre. I have tried game after game over the years to find a Zombie game that worked really well. I nearly through Zombie Town out the window in frustration after 2 plays.
Then this gem came out. It provides the perfect mix of cool cards and graphic design to balance out the flow of the game between the Zombie and Human players. I like most of the quests I have played so far and the expansion was done to the same great standard as the base game. I look forward to many more plays of this in the future with whatever Ameritrash players I can muster up.

Cannot get a better theme for me. Some places the gameplay doesn't quite fit the theme (zombies move around intelligently, protecting the house is easier from the outside), but usually I feel like I am in a city being attacked by zombies.

There is a good bit of luck here. Within the first few turns, one side or the other always feels they have the advantage (Usually this is the zombies). A few dice rolls can really swing momentum though. I don't like how the game can slow down significantly at the end. I think the game would be SO much better if it lasted 60-70 mins. The last 30 mins. of most of our games have been a dull.

This is not really my type of game as it has a roll and move aspect, there is a lot of take that aspect to the game. Still, I quite enjoyed this game anyway. The theme is well integrated to the game and it feels just like a college zombie flick and the soundtrack is nice when played on low volume. There is a certain feel of angst when taking the decisions and even if the zombies are quite dumb, there is certainly a lot of strategy behind what long term decisions to take to hinder the humans. I played my first game with the advanced rules and I think they work great and I suspect that they are much better than the beginning rules set.

The feel of the game is that it is very tactical and while I can agree on that premise, there is certainly strategic options, especially for the zombie player. It isn’t fun to be stuck with all your zombies in one corner of the map, because they are slow.

There is some grit in the card and rules interactions that will lead to arguments or laughter, depending on your game group. Our house rule of allowing humans to kill zombies on ANY doubles (not just "winning" doubles) seems to have addressed balance concerns, but so what? This is a game you play for the experience as much as for any chance to win.

I love this zombie game!  Last Night on Earth is one of the best thematic game I've ever played.  You really feel like your in a zombie movie.  Hitting a zombie with a baseball bat until the bat breaks is something I would probably do in real life if a zombie was "running" after me!
The replay value of this game is incredible!  With all the differents scenarios, random boards and heroes, no 2 game will ever be the same.

To be honest I think my thoughts about LNOE are somewhat conflicted. 

The game had a much more fun and strategic rulesystem than Zombies!!! A couple of years ago we played many games of LNOE and even though we had lots of good times the game just didn't manage to stay fun or intrigueing. I can see why some would prefer this to Zombicide, as the rules are much different, but to me it just became slow and boring after a handfull of games.

RATING: 7
Rating based on just one play so far.  May improve after subsequent plays.  Played with one player distracted watching a movie the whole time, so kind of killed the mood.  Game is heavy on theme, so distractions ebb on the quality of the play.  May improve with a better game group.  Also, rules and card interpretations were bogging down play on top of the distracted player.  Too simple of game to have so many unclear wordings.  Like to see a concisely written manual with good faq.

RATING: 8
Cool theme; easy to learn; fast-paced play.  Game mechanics lend themselves well to the zombie-movie feel.  The turns go fairly quick, and players have minimal idle time.  Quality products: nice looking map, cards, pictures and other game components (Although, my cards came stuck together in a block). Players can get through the five scenarios fairly quickly.  Thus, the game has the potential of quickly becoming rote.  On the other hand, new scenarios, characters, and map sections can easily be added to the game.  On the down side, random cards and zombie spawn rolls can greatly change game balance of any scenario; One game can be close while the next game of the same scenario can be a blow-out for either side.  I don't enjoy a lopsided game, even if I am on the winning side.  All-in-all, a fun, light, fast-paced game for those who like the zombie theme.

The first time out was definitely fun, but the card draws and die rolls heavily favored the human team, making it way too easy. The second game was closer, but still seemed to favor the humans. Overall, quite an enjoyable game. It encourages discussion and teamwork, and was just plain fun.

RATING: 3
I wish I could say I throught this game was good, I'm looking for a good zombie game as much as anyone, but sadly it's not.  Way too slow and clunky.  Spend too many turns where you do nothing but draw a card.  A Zombie fights most likely result, is nothing.  Some of the event cards are very creative, but there are never enough zombies on the board so that your really scarred.        
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I always enjoy this when I play it. It might be my favorite cooperative game. There isn't a ton of strategy. It's more about generating a story and creating a bit of tension as the zombies close in. Most games result in something funny or notable happening that we find ourselves talking about the next time we play. 

In my last game, my friend's son gleefully shot zombies with a revolver for the first three quarters of the game. At the very end, it looked like we (the heroes) had an easy win as we just needed to survive the round, we were all in buildings, and I had a card to keep zombies out. But then the zombies got a card that allowed three of them to suddenly appear in the building with poor Jenny the farm girl. We were like "dammit Jenny, check the basement before you nail the windows shut!" She was able to heroically fend them off, but it was close.

A very awesome zombie/horror movie game. Great minis, nice looking modular board, tons and tons of available scenarios (each one with a very different feel and gameplay) makes for endless replayability.

This is my favourite game at the moment. Because of the theme it attracts the gamers I know, as well as other people who don't like boardgames that much.

Pros: Great theme, great art, being able to play the zombies, many scenarios to increase the re-playability, simple mechanic.

Great fun, plus the included sound track adds to a big night of games and bad horror.

Can be a bit shit for zombie master. But gotta go with it.
Gutted that my 7 and 9 yr old didn't enjoy it. Think having to confirm they knew what their cards meant every round slowed it too much for them, and they were frustrated with the limited amount they could do per turn. 
Maybe give them a few yrs, and stick to LNoE adult only games for now. The little ones have dungeonquest, talisman, space hulk, brimstone and mice n mystics, Arcadia Quest, Memoir 44 etc, to keep them going!

I'd had my eye on this game for a while and finally got a chance to play. It did not disappoint. I loved the team aspect, I loved the components, and it is dripping with theme. The CD is a take-it-or-leave-it thing for me. The amount of scenarios, boards, and cards just in the basic game are enough to keep you entertained for a long time, and it practically begs you to make up your own. I played 3 games in various scenarios on different sides with different people and lost every single one. Never was I left feeling like the dice or cards had failed me. I was simply left seeing how I could do it better next time. In a game with so much randomness, it translates to pure fun. My rating could easily go down if I see the scenarios having a simple way for one side to always win, or it could go up if it continues to be this much fun. One caveat: this game is not for children. Too scary, mild innuendo, and a few swear words make this better suited for a teenage or older crowd.

For a game with this many cards and components, it's a breeze to explain, intuitive to play, and creates splendid cinematic scenes every time. The modular boards, multiple heroes and scenarios provide a lot of replayability with just this set - you don't need any expansions to have fun exploring the game. But, for me, where this game really shines is how you can customise it: you can design your own character sheets using templates here on BGG using either the minis that come with the game, or your own. It's a lot of fun to play this game with the heroes being your gaming group friends, playing themselves ...

RATING: 6.5
This one has everything Zombies!!! promised. Let me explain:

Zombies!!! has awesome miniatures, and tons of them. It has a board full of houses, and has you play a survivor trying desparately to outgun and outrun the slow-moving menacing evil clawy bity zombies.

But, the mechanics are sluggish, the cards are so situational that many of them become barely playable, things in general are unbalanced with some stuff being really powerful and other stuff being really weak.

LNoE on the other hand has balanced cards, great mechanics, plays easily without much downtime, and gives both the zombie player(s) and the survivors tons more options and things to do and stuff to manage.

Overall, a really great game, expanded by superb expansions to an incredible package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great game if you love games that drip with theme. It really makes you feel like you are in a b-movie involving zombies. 

The cards and components are very thick and of high quality. The sculpts for the characters and zombies are well done. 

The artwork, conceived as live action photos, is excellent and contributes heavily to the theme. 

A great game that only gets better as they add expansions and supplement packs.

RATING: 4
This is NOT the best zombie game by far. The best zombie game in my view is [b]Dead of Night[/b]. See my comment on the that game to find out why. (I haven't played Zombie Plague yet.)

Last Night on Earth is fun with a good group...but because of the group, not because of the game. The game itself is clunky, light and artificial. Since the events and player powers happen through card-play, they come out of nowhere. Plus there are player abilities that also come out of nowhere. Thus the elements of zombie films in this game are very "gamey": they are artificial devices to allow players to do certain things for internal game objectives, but they do not flow organically from the subject matter of zombie survival horror itself. This eliminates the claustrophobia, fear and tension that you find packed in real games like Dead of Night. In fact, I'd say DoN is both simpler (fewer rules) but deeper, more difficult, more tense, and far more immersive. LNOE by comparison is fast food: processed cheese on spam with ketchup all over. Popcorn with fake butter. It's a trans fat of a game.

Not really a fan of 1 vs all games but this one is pretty good. The zombies seems surprisingly hard to kill though. Good scenarios and a good pace. I hate Treefrog games though with their sticky plastic cards and how their characters are shots of real people in Wal-Mart Halloween costumes.

It's a fun game. While Zombicide is more the "Dawn of the Dead" game, Last Night on Earth feels more like "Night of the living dead". The only reason zombicide hit the table more is the fully co-op gameplay.

RATING: 7
Better than Zombies!!! but I am underwhelmed.  I would have preferred heroes with more hit points, but stronger zombies so that they slowly weaken heroes. I would have liked a more tactical gameplay (this tends to be a luckfest).
What I like however is the proper camp, B-movie chrome.  So it's a 7, still waiting for a quick, tactical zombie game.

Only played one game, was attacked on the first turn, got my movement cancelled due to a locked door, fended off a zombie, moved 1 space, got attacked again, managed to kill it, but was then killed by another zombie after rolling a pair of "2" to the zombie's "3"...

The game components looked good, and although I watched the other 3 players, the game simply did not look fun.  And when asked if they liked the game, the other players simply said that "something appears to be missing".

Will most likely be giving this one another go to see if we did something wrong, but it came across as a nice looking bad game.

I think if I can find an expansion that puts a little more favor onto the heroes I may be able to get my wife to like it a little more. She never wants to play the zombies and complains that the zombies always win. I wanted to suggest that maybe it's just the player...  No, then I wouldn't get to ever play it.  :)

Fast, loose, and ruins your day with a turn of a card. Despite up to 14 zombies on the board, the game gets around the problem of "Waiting for the dungeon master to move and fight all monsters", by keeping it to a simple 1 zombie die vs 2 hero dice, highest die wins.

Easy to pick up, easy to explain in stages (First scenario and win:loss conditions, then the Zombie phase, then the hero phase).

Other than Dead of Winter, probably my favorite zombie themed game.  Mostly a miniatures type game where you are fighting zombies and working towards some goal.  One or more players has to control the zombies.  Something I like to play every October but that is about it.  It is way too fiddly for what it is.  The cards are often not clear, the rule book is not that great, and we end up always looking stuff up on BGG.

RATING: 8
Initial rating 7. Further plays may raise this rating.

Update: Advanced rules moved this to an 8. Just wish I could find or make rules for the tractor... See, many components in the game have no rules associated with them; they are included for use in future and home brew scenarios. This is both cool and annoying (trying to locate rules which don't yet exist). The rule book has some substantial ambiguities, but these are overcome by player agreement before play begins. The rules also sometimes slide into truly tortured grammar and syntax -- as if translated from another language. Seems to have been designed in Washington state, so that's probably not the case though.

Depending on how Flying Frog supports this title, it could be a real winner! With additional scenarios springing up regularly, this seems likely.

The less said about the "Soundtrack" the better. I prefer Black Dice, Coil, God Speed You Black Emperor, Throbbing Gristle, John Zorn, Aklo, even Stravinsky over this upbeat, almost danceable CD.

Later: Bumped this up to a 9 after playing it all day long with friends, crafting one new homebrew scenario after another. Huge replayability right out of the box -- as much a game constructor kit as a game.

Played this on two occasions at a boardgame meetup before I ever started recording plays. Never again. Also has turned me completely off of horror-zombie themed games. Too much randomness, very little strategy and decision-making. Lots of theme ruined by idiotic gameplay. For the humans: run away from zombies, get some weapon, flip some card, roll some dice, kill some zombies, rinse and repeat. For the zombies: crawl toward humans, flip some card, roll some dice, wound or kill a human or two, rinse and repeat. Just shoot me.

WOW... what a great game! Everything what you can expect in a cool zombie game and much, much, more!!! C'mon, it even comes with a cool sounding soundtrack/cd that you can play while playing the game! The bits are great and the game play even better! I had the chance to play the zombie character twice and almost defeated the heroes... came down to one "lucky" card played to prevent me from spreading plague throughout the town! Can't wait to see what's next for the expansion, great time!

RATING: 9
This is a game for people who love zombies, like (and know how) to play cooperative (survivors, zombie hordes), and generally love to play out theme. 

The mechanics do a great job for this purpose, and the variety of missions and player combinations ensure great replayability. There is some noticeable draw luck involved, and not everyone likes that. Also, this is NOT a serious survival Zombie game (ATZ does a much better job at that). But there are a lot of tactical decisions to be made and coordination with other players is absolutely necessary.

LNoE is about the only Zombie game I can play with both kids and wife, everyone enjoys it, and it is one of the few games that is still being requested regularly after several years of play - the perfect game for dark and rainy nights for some good old Halloween Americana.

RATING: 9
Very polished.  Much less errata than most card-based games.  Oozing with theme and fun.  Easy to for players to jump-in or drop-out mid-game (a rare quality).

Only reason it is not a 10 is the great amount of luck (cards, timing, dice-rolls) that can give one side a great advantage.  Not that I can think of a way to reduce these occasional imbalances without hurting the wonder replayability.

The very first modern board game I ever picked up. During the time, zombies were all the rage and I was throwing horror themed movie nights. It was fun to play a game that felt like a movie. The systems are a bit too simplistic for me now, but it still sees play under the right conditions.

RATING: 7
Not a bad game, very simple, easy to learn and teach, althought I am not fond of games with GMs (Game masters) because your games difficult and fun factor is determined by him/her. The overall the game was fun and plus art is excellent, it looks eactly like a B-movie, like how most zombie movies are (no offense I love watching ALL zombie movies [except Terror Planet, that was so bad]) not to mention the soundtrack to put you in the mood, that is probably the best aspect of the game, over its game play.

RATING: 7
I used to love this game, but the last few games we've played have been four-player and something about them has really rubbed me the wrong way.  We were playing with the Growing Hunger expansion and it felt like nothing the zombies could ever do would work. I think that the problem is twofold: I think that the expansion tends to favor the survivors a little bit, but I think the bigger problem is the four-player rules (where 2 play survivors and 2 play zombies).  I think the game works MUCH better with only a single zombie player.

I'm willing to give it another shot without the expansion and with only one zombie player and hopefully that will bring the magic back.  Otherwise, this one will slide even further down the list.

After reading the rules, I knew this one was going to be a gem in my collection.  I don't have anything else in this genre, and sometimes you just want to eat brains.
EDIT (after 7 plays):  This game has been more fun each time I've played it and some of the scenarios are truly for experienced Heroes (Escape in the Truck, Defend the Manor House).  It's very playable solo to work on strategies and timing, and every game feels like a mini-movie.  Great!  
ALSO:  There are some vocal posters on BGG who are absolutely sold that the Zombies are overpowered and the game is not winnable for the Heroes.  My experiences have demonstrated otherwise.

RATING: 6
A seemingly fun game that is just too random.  I honestly believe that it fails by making it competitive rather than coop.  Zombies get to draw cards every turn, move every turn, and move through walls, whereas the "heroes" must choose to either move or draw a card. Should combat ensue, the zombies win ties, but are only pushed back if they should lose to a similarly armed hero and are killed only on doubles (on two dice).  In short, a random shit-fest of lack-luster play.

Scenarios are not balanced. But, the game is fun to play, regardless. I like this game because you can play the zombies. Normally, you cannot because zombies are mindless creatures reacting to the nearest stimulus. However, in this game, you are actually playing the "Luck factor." For example, if a human tries t go through a door, you can play a "locked door" card if you have one. You basically tried to keep a hand of cards that channel, block, or hinder those pesky humans.

Awesome game! For me and my friends, this is the premier game. Could be that we are into zombie stuff. It's like being in a zombie movie. Flying Frog spared no detail on this one.

I'd describe this game as Clue mixed with Risk with cards in there too.

There seems to have been a revival of interest in so-called 'Ameritrash' games recently and this is likely to be a flagship product for those who like their games to be light, fun, random, trash-talking experiences. It's got great bits for a small production, loads of theme and you can almost breathe in the dark atmosphere. I don't think anyone need be deceived that this is a game that you win by skill as simply everything in the game involves die rolling, although a close finish does up the excitement level somewhat.

I'd expected this to be a silly, pointless, dice-rolling zombie game, but it's actually much better than I thought it would be.  Actually, it's a light tactical miniatures game with teams, one of which happens to involve zombies.  The game's longer than I'd like it to be, and the theme isn't one I care for too much, but it's well put together and I don't blame anyone for liking it. (1 play)

RATING: 5.5
Different characters, maps, and scenarios provide for a bit of variety, but the underlying gameplay seems too simple. The right choice or correct strategy usually seems obvious, especially for the zombie player. 

Cards provide a bit of hidden information, but it's usually correct just to bulldoze through whatever tricks opponents have up their sleeves anyways.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I do like zombies, and I do like playing this game, but even for a light zombie game it's a bit too light! I mean, zombies can walk through any walls? Some parts of this game feel just like lazy design decisions. Other than that, it can be easily teached to new gamers and is a fine gateway game for people who have a thing for the undead.

I would point out though that it is meant as a lighter game and plays that way.  My wife really likes the cooperative play but the best part of it though are the stories that are woven around the events.

So much for true love. HA!

I went to a game shop with my non-hobby-gamer father-in-law, and he wound up seeing LNoE, liking the look of it, and walking out with it. My wife and I had a great time playing a couple games of it with the mother- and father-in-law. The game itself is pretty decent, but playing a niche game with the in-laws at _their request_ and that they were excited enough about to purchase was incredible.

This game oozes theme and it plays out like a "B" horror movie.  The games have been like a roller coaster from beginning to end.  

Here is an example: It looks like an easy win for the Heroes.  They need Gas & Keys to leave town.  The heroes play a card that gets them the gas and Billy finds the keys in the High School on the first turn. This is bad for the Zombies but Billy & Sally end up together in the Gym in the same square and a "Last Night on Earth" card is played on them.  The unfortunate lovers end up getting killed in the gym.  Several other heroes die due to bad luck and cards but in the end the Heroes manage to win as the Drifter and the Nurse escape the town.

It was great!!

This is a fantastic recreation of your favorite B-Rate zombie movie in table-top game format.  All of the artwork is created using actual actors or models with heavy doses of photoshop to create the spooky atmosphere and film grain. The box comes with a collection of different scenarios each with different objectives and winning conditions for both the hero team and the zombie team.  They even included a collection of bits that aren't even used in the provided scenarios encouraging user created content, most of which can be found here on the 'Geek.  Game play is easy to learn, combat is resolved quickly, and almost every game yields an "Oh-Snap!" moment.

Although not a traditional "zombie" gamer, I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  Fun.  Easy to learn.  Relatively quick to play.  Lots of dice and a bit of luck to scavenge useful items (i.e., ranged weapons), but it's OK with this kind of game.

A bit like Betrayal at House on the Hill in that you're likely playing more for the experience than a deep strategic thinking exercise.  Have only played the "Die, Zombies, Die!" scenario.  Some of the other scenarios look a bit for involved (and likely add a lot of replayability to the game).

It's a fairly good time in its way, but Dead of Winter has pretty much taken everything Last Night does (art, rules construction, creating atmosphere, etc.) and done it with far more polish. LNoE still has its niche, though, as it keeps its tongue firmly in cheek; it's not a parody or anything, but it brings a distinctly pulpier, less serious attitude to the zombie apocalypse genre that sets it apart.

Ideal Players: 2-6

Description: Play out a B horror movie as you fight off zombies.

Pro: Different feel for the zombie players and the hero players. Different scenarios provide variety and replayability. Plays fast and easy. Theme matches mechanic perfectly. Each game tells a great story. Fantastic bits and art.

Con: The first scenario isn't fun. Success or failure largely determined by dice. Players can't take the game too seriously.

This was the board game I bought before I really got into board games. It's a monstrously pretty piece of Ameritrash that I have started growing away from, but the asymmetric play is interesting at the very least. Scenarios can be stacked in the favor of one side over the other and there are some strange combos that interact with the discard pile but the game is overall still enjoyable enough.

A more advanced version of Zombies, but in a good way.  The additional rules and ways to play the game make this a more enjoyable game to play.  I found Zombies to be far too long for what it was supposed to be.  Last Night seems to be about the right length for the game that it is (~1 hour).  

Last Night has a similiar feel to Betrayal for me.  Neither game is completely original, but they are just fun to play.  Both are light enough that non-gamers enjoy playing it and their is not an overflow of rules to learn when playing the game (another good thing).  So far, everyone I've shown the game to wanted to play it again right away or wanted to buy it afterwards.

But as an experience game, its quite a good one.

I was skeptical when my buddy Joe first mentioned picking up this game at Gencon 07.  You see, he is simply a zombie/halloween fanatic, and buys many games on said theme alone.  However, I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  This is a well thought out, well themed, well produced game.  Most horror games focus on  "experience" over gameplay, but this one PLAYS very well.   I'd gladly play it again as few horror games are thematic AND play well.

My Brother bought this to play with family since it is light on rules and was hopefully big on fun. We were actually all pretty bored as there were no real decisions to make, very little so my biggest complaint but yes it is just a "hack and slash" game so it is what it is.  

I had heard a lot about the game and wanted to like it, I do like heavy on theme games big on fun but it just didnt come together for us.  Note that I am not a "Zombie" fan like many people are but I do have no problem playing a good light themed fun game if it has things going for it. 

Overall I think the game was very well produced and as far as an "Evil Dead" type board game goes, you would probably have a hard time doing better than this. Everything is there that you would want and they threw in a good bit of variety.  

All these types suffer from a couple of things which is some group dependancy and because it is semi-coop a dominant player can run the show a little too much, not really knocks on the game, just something to watch for with this type of game. 

I will have to replay it with a different group to hopefully bring it more to fruitation but at most will be a 7 for me. I do think its a good hack and slash kill the Zombie game, game time is good and luck not an issue for this, some more decisions would be what I would want different but I'm not sure how you would add them in, again it is what it is which for me is just much too simplistic in its raw form (and if the family didnt like it then I dont need to own it). Could make a good gateway game especially for Zombie fans.

So I love this game, mostly because of its great theming and malleable mechanics.  

There are some games that I feel are not meant to be altered, but to me, Flying Frog created this game with every intention that the player would make tons of house rules and ultimately make it their own.

The game my friends and myself have put together with LNOE is sooooo much fun.  One of the biggest changes is that we took the heroes forced play order mechanic, and instead gave them 4 actions a turn (where they can only shoot once per turn). We also made an AI mechanic for the Zombies that (give or take a few cards) makes this game work pretty flawlessly as a pure coop.

I have played through just a handful of their scenarios and have created and played many.

I love all the parts that come with it and feel they are great quality.  This goes without mentioning all of the amazing expansions that really add so much depth to the game.

There is also an awesome community of player fans of this game that are always offering interesting alternate play styles and all kinds of content.

I have converted many Zombicide fans to LNOE fans and proudly so.  If you are creative and looking for an awesome Zombie game, get this one please.

I've only played twice but it is simply lacking something for me. I played one game intent on playing to win and we killed our 15th zombie on the 10th turn and needed only one wond to loose our 2nd hero. Pretty close eh? We played a second game and I zoned out and just did the easiest thing that came to mind while fleshing out a World of Darkness character. The result, we lost a second charcter on the 10th turn after killing 14 zombies in a hand to hand battle. So the result was almost identical even though my effort was incredibly different. Not so good in my opinion

RATING: 8
This game is one of my favorites. A game that lives up to the "survival-horror" genre, since it often ends with the survivors running for their lifes and leaving their friends behind in panic.

The game posseses a good replay value since the map consist of 8 big map tiles who all have diffrent houses, which contains diffrent abilities/objects that the survivors can use AND the map can be randomized 

one player takes on the role of the zombies and the other play like the survivors. The survivors goal is to survie through the scenario chosen, examples like finding gas and a pair of car keys to start up a car in order to escape or defending a manor.

Now this is a fun game! Don't expect deep strategy or innovative mechanics. This game is all about the mood. The presentation is stunning, the event and item cards simply ooze "theme".

Do yourself a favor, though, and skip the soundtrack CD. A good intention, sure, but the result is cheap, cheesy and laughable. 

***UPDATE***
While this game gets a lot of play time and is always good for some laughs, I'm really starting to see how truly simple and limited the system is. Furthermore, I think the game is quite unbalanced in favor of the zombies.

Last Night on Earth is a very thematically beautiful game. The components all look very good (save for the unpainted miniatures), and all of the elements of the game really wrap up to this nice, B-movie zombie package. All complete with a soundtrack that, in my opinion, really adds a lot to the experience.

...But the game takes 5 hours! For the amount of depth this game has (which is little, its mechanics are no better than American games from the '90s), I would enjoy it more if it took substantially less time. I feel like I'm making few meaningful choices, the luck runs the show, and while the journey is fun and flavorful, I walk away from the game feeling let down. I likely had no real impact on whether or not the game was won or lost, and due to its length, it's probably the only game we played that night.

Initial Rating 9.0 (December 2010)

I love Zombie games so maybe (just maybe) I’m a little biased here folks ;).

For a time my favorite zombie game, now it is in my top 3 zombie games (after Mall of Horror and at the same level of Dead of Night), also it was in my top ten of games for a while. 

I think this is one (if not THE ONE) of the best zombie games ever made, I have to play more, but I really dig this game. It has superb components (except the soundtrack which is crap), engaging dynamics between heroes and zombies, super replayability due to new expansions and scenarios, it has a great theme (obviously), it plays well with 2, 3 or 4 players. It is also a fast paced game so you won’t get bored with it. 

Bottom line don´t expect a highly tactical or strategic  game, this is a fun game with lots of luck. LNOE is one of my favorite games.

Current Rating: 8.0

The first time I played LNOE was on 2010, that was also the year I took boardgaming as my main hobby, however, in these 5 years my gaming tastes have changed a lot (evolved?). I’m no longer the same person so, nowadays, I no longer enjoy LNOE as I used to. In fact I sold my copy of the game. Due to this, I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my current feelings for the game with the BGG recommended rating system.

I love that a player can control the zombies, this is still the only zombie game I have played who has this feature. I no longer enjoy the gratuitous luck inherent in the game. LNOE can take well over 2 hours so the high luck factor begins to bother me. All things considered,  I’m still rating it very highly because nostalgia plays a part too, had I know the game for the first time today, I suspect its rating would be much lower. As it stands, LNOE is almost a good game for me,  I will settle for playing it from time to time but I don’t need the urge to own it.

Ex Top Ten Game.

I wanted to like Last Night on Earth, but my first play really fell flat.  As in many "one v. many" games, the zombie player gets to do a lot more interesting things than the human players do, particularly when the zombie player gets a lose-turn card to play on a human.  I doubt I'll ever get to play the zombie master, so that's a huge problem for me.  

The basic (kill 15 zombies) scenario seems to hinge on whether the humans can find enough weaponry.  Which is fine, I suppose, but tends to break the game when the humans can't find any decent weapons.

I can't imagine wanting to play LNOE when I could play either the Buffy game or Wabbit Wampage instead.  The only thing Last Night on Earth has on either game is plastic zombies.

I'll try to play at least once more so as not to give up on the game too quickly.

This game does a really good job invoking it's theme and making you feel like you're absorbed in a storyline. Lots of variant scenarios make replayability very high with this one.

Update: After many plays, think I may have hit my burn out point with this game. Was fun for a while, but is starting to feel overly fiddly and random, and some of my recent sessions have dragged out longer than necessary. Will have to see if my opinion turns around, as this was one of my favorite games for years, but the past few times I've played I haven't enjoyed myself very much.

I love that this is co-op. I like the combat resolution mechanic a lot even though it is fairly simple and dice-based.  The "Defend the Manor House" scenario seemed a little silly as it is better to be outside of the house than inside the house.  Overall, one of the most fun games I have played this year.

Recently dropped my rating of this a little.  Some scenarios are better than others.  Some scenarios force the zombie player to do "un-zombie-like" things to even have a chance of winning (like stand around and guard a spawn pit.)

This is an okay Zombie game. There are a few things that bug me about it, both in the rules and thematically. First, I think it should be pure co-op. Having someone play the zombies leads to things like them moving to avoid gasoline and the like... Zombies shouldn't be smart. As far as the rules go, it just seems like the game is weighted a little too much towards the zombies, between the card play, and the fact that they do damage regardless of who attacks who (but the heroes have to initiate to do damage), not to mention shear numbers. It's not bad. I'd play again. But I don't know that I would seek it out.

Flying Frog's zombie game doesn't just draw settings and villains like other zombie games -- it takes the characters, the plot, the atmosphere... it's a zombie movie in a box! With multiple challenging scenarios, and balanced roles for players as both human AND zombie, this is one game that will keep players involved and in the mood throughout play.

PLUS: easy to learn, balanced play, quality pieces, LOTS of possibilities, soundtrack!
MINUS: not competitive unless you're two players

Good, goofy B-Movie fun.  Played once so far, 2 Zombie players against 2 Hero players.  Things were going very poorly for our Heroes with poor Sally being infected just after a passionate moment spent with Johnny, and both Jake and the Sheriff teetering on the brink of death themselves.  With mere minutes before sunset, the zombie horde (including Sally) found themselves backed into a corner of the school, afraid of a little fire extinguisher.  Quick as a snap, Old Betsy held them at bay, while the heroes ran to the other side of the school and tossed a lit torch onto the gas canister that Sally had tossed into the corner moments before her conversion.  *poof* went the gas canister, killing 9 zombies in one fell swoop!  Classic B-movie fun!

Rollicking good zombie game with lightweight rules and terrific components! Playing a 4P game on the zombie team, it started off easy as we spammed the board with zombies and had the humans on the rack. But those damn attraction rules--where zombies must move toward an adjacent human--were our downfall. We didn't try the soundtrack CD. I'd definitely like to try some of the other scenarios and play as a human.

RATING: 6
This game has a problem. It absolutely MUST be dramatic and close to be of any interest, and the game has no mechanics to offset the randomness to ensure a decent play experience whenever you bring it out. Each play I could rate a 4 or a 9 or anywhere in-between depending entirely on card draws and die rolls. Our first game (Save the Townsfolk) was an absolute cakewalk for the Heroes because they happened to draw the townsfolk they needed early, the zombie player had lousy spawning rolls, and the whole game felt pointless. Now I recognize that subsequent games are likely to have a better dramatic arc, but since there's nothing in the game to help ensure that, the next game could end up being just as lousy. This game has some serious design holes and the rules are sloppily written. Still, I bet I would have some good experiences with it, I just can't predict when!

Pros:
- Dripping with theme
- Neat characters and components
- Many scenarios = great replayability.  The thing that would most attract me to playing again is trying out a new scenario.

Cons:
- Seems a little long for what it is.
- Outdated "roll and move" mechanism for heroes.  Very frustrating.  One of few parts that isn't thematic - if I'm one space away from someone, I can only get on their space if I roll a one exactly.  This could easily be fixed by allowing players to move UP TO their dice roll.

6/10 b/c, although it was fun, I really have to be in the right mood for this, and I can see that happening only occasionally.

Basically you either get to control a horde of zombies or a hero trying to stop the horde.  Role the dice... look at a few cards... kill some zombies... listen to zombie noises coming from the controller of the horde... role some more dice... kill some more zombies... maybe a hero falls to the horde to be killed later....  Ok so I've done it and don't feel like I was satisfied.  I felt like the designers did capture the theme fairly well on the plus side.

I guess the theme is kind of fun. If you are a human the odds seem stacked against you, but maybe they should be when you are facing zombies. Strategy seems pretty light. Head to a building so you can search which means take a card that can give you an item or allow an action. I'm not sure how many scenarios there are or which are best. I recently played one where we had to find the keys and the fuel. This sceario seemed mainly affected by when the cards showed up. Fights are random rolls of dice, but there are occasional card modifiers. It doesn't seem deep, but offers some laughs.

Have played it quite a bit now and enjoy it a lot.  Contains more tactical play than Zombies or Maul of America and the decision making process is therefore more interesting.  Like the focus on scenarios and the generally strong narrative.

Players should pay careful attention to those cards which can be played only at the start of a turn as these are often played incorrectly.

RATING: 5
Nowhere near as fast and frantic as others comment. It was ok as an experience but it dragged towards the end. Even after 90 minutes of play I wasn't able at all to tell which miniature belonged to which hero and always had to ask on every move. Not to speak of considering all these cards that a hero might have. Best played in the same brainless state as the featured Zombies.

Don't believe all the hype, I did. I've played 4 times now and the game has failed to impress me. Basically park your character in a room keep drawing cards till you get what you need, go try to kill some zombies. Good luck with the weighted die in favor of ones. Not the worst game I have ever played but FAR from great.

At first I thought the game was unbalanced in favour of the zombie player, but as the game went on I found it to be fairly balanced. The zombies can only move 1 space, although that can be modified by cards and they can't wield weapons. Only played 2 of the scenarios but it seems to have alot of replayability.

RATING: 9
I, personally, love this game.  It's such an easy game to teach people new to board gaming.  I really like how it plays like a B-list zombie film.  There are some balancing issues (I think that the humans get very overpowered very quickly), but the varying scenarios can make it a bit more difficult.

Highly recommended!

RATING: 4
Graphically, a well-made zombie game. The rules are simple, but the execution is [b]too simplistic[/b]. Feels like a [b]'tag-you're-it' or 'run-around-the-map'[/b] game. Many scenarios seem unintuitive and lack suspense. The Nurse Preacher combo is very broken, but the heroes don't stand a chance without it.

Seems very skewed towards the zombies. It takes too much effort to search for the card you want! By then, you're swarmed. Doesn't help that zombie cards hurt A LOT!

By the way, the CD was a nice idea, but the composed songs [b]lack eeriness and fullness[/b] (bass). At times, it gets amateurly midi'ish. I think the [b]sound is too dead[/b] (not zombie dead either); it needed some reverb.

This game proves that Flying Frog is purely art lure and minimal in gameplay. I am boycotting them because they think they can [b]win gamers with simple sex appeal[/b].

RATING: 6.5
A well-produced zombie game with great components and simple gameplay. Its enjoyable and definitely one of the better zombie games I've played, but there are still some problems with it. Most importantly, the majority of gameplay centers around cards. And the cards are wordy. Lots of reading and re-reading and time spent trying to figure out how to resolve effects when multiple cards are played at the same time.

Games can drag on (especially on first-play) when players spend a lot of their turn reading the cards before moving, thus slowing the game for everyone. Also, the Zombie players do not really seem to have much active gameplay. A lot of the game focuses on the Heroes. The Zombie player seems to have been included just to move the zombies. Just move 1 square... thats it. 

The good points: great components, fantastic soundtrack (albeit a little short), simple to learn and play. I think that with the right group playing QUICKLY and not analysing every single move, this game can be really fun. As it is, it currently rates just above average for me.

RATING: 7
This is a fun simple zombie game.  The heroes have enough variability to make each game different.  I enjoy playing both sides and the games usually are close.  I find most of the building special abilities are worthless because they require certain items to be in the discard pile.  I prefer Flying Frog's A Touch of Evil only because it is slightly more complex.  I will choose a more strategic game over this when given the chance but I admit this game provides a good night of fun every time we've played it.

RATING: 8.3
Several plays.

All games played well. 2nd game had an unexpected hero win (it looked for sure like the zombies had it in the bag). Zombies won third game "at the wire." It could have easily gone either way.

Very nice components. Wonderful relatively short playing time. Random set ups (board, cards, scenarios and the choice of picking or randomly selecting heroes in play) make for a varied play experience (even if using the same scenario things can develop quite differently from game to game). 

Manageable game (bookeeping; number of pieces and rules complexity).

Atmospheric. Captures thematic flavor very well.

Calls for some good tactical planning in adapting to changing circumstances. (i.e. It has just started raining heavily - Do I still make my way across town to the police station to grab a shotgun - from the discard pile - as I had planned? The rain will slow me down making it easier for the zombies to intercept me).

Several good laughs and surprises in each game. Billy is in the garage and wounded. Three zombies are confronting him. But Billy is right at the door and very fast, being a track star and all. He will simply run out the door of the garage and put some space between himself and the zombies. No problem! Go Billy go! Hey! What's this? The door won't open! "I am afraid Billy can't go through that door... see here... it's locked!" Billy soon joins the rest of the dead meat in the room.

"Hey, let's hide in the cornfield." (By the way, that strategy worked for the short term, but as more zombies converged on  the cornfield the plan fell apart).

All three examples  above are actual game experiences.

Alot of fun with this one; I had to buy my own copy.  A game my wife will actually play with me, as well...due to theme and ingenious simplicity in the rules.  Still allows for a lot of strategy, tactics and surprises!
The "toolbox" feel to the rules adds tons of replayability.
This game has increased in rating with repeated plays.
Highly recommended! 

I also ordered the "Stock up" bonus from their website, because more is almost always better...right?!

Will rate with more plays, but the initial feel is around a 9.  A lot of that due to fun and theme factor!
Sometimes, the people you play with can affect your "enjoyment"...

I played this once, two on two, and my friends who played the zombies assured me and my pard that it isn't always quite so uneven. We lost after about four rounds. I might believe them, and I'd probably try this one more time to see if they're right - but if the humans got hosed again, I'd consider my time irrevocably lost.

This game is fun thematically, and I like playing it somewhat.  However it seems very imbalanced in favor of the heroes, and yet the zombie side is the only one that has very many meaningful decisions.

I LOVE LAST NIGHT ON EARTH!  I'm sort of glad I spend more time playing it than reading about "game balance."  I have never noticed such a major unbalance as I have seen described by some of the people on the geek.  I remember playing only one game as the Zombies where I was utterly slaughtered.  Most of our games came down to the final turn and they were always so tense (and they felt as cinematic as we could possibly have hoped) that we immediately decided to play again.  I've converted non-gamers to gamers with this game and it has been the most requested title I own for months now.  I can't wait for Growing Hunger.

The Good: Strong Theme. Multiple scenarios. Plays short (around 2 hours). Good components. The Zombies were real tough to beat (at least in my first game), and that is a good thing, as a challenging game will see more table time. Manages to do a fair job of telling a story as the game progresses. Lots of life-or-death dice rolling. I found it very easy to play solitaire.

The Bad: Light on strategy, but there are meaningful choices to be made. 

No Ugly: The card decks were stuck together REAL HARD, and it was a challenge to separate them. Many cards were damaged due to the melted laminate. This was listed as an ugly, but great customer service saved the day by sending me new decks !

Aesthetically nice, but I felt like this one was a little too messy for my taste.  Really, it's mainly a card-driven game with cards that are thematic, I guess, but I would like something a bit more trashy, elegant and rawrr fun than this sometimes plodding game with a lot of extra rules.  

*Edit* After a couple more plays, I like the game just fine, but I feel like it's not a whole lot of fun to play the zombies.  It's also not fun if you have too many expansion cards mixed into the deck and so you spend the whole game just standing around buildings digging through the deck.

My first play of this was maybe not enough to fully judge the game, but I can certainly say it was a great cooperative gaming experience. All of the players on the human side were active in discussions about how to proceed, but never to a point of making the game drag. The scenario we played was ultimately frustrating as we need to find gasoline in the deck (which we did) and keys as well (which we never did), but it was still a good time. I can really picture hating this in the wrong group, though.

My second play was a 3-player and lost a lot of the cooperative discussion aspect. It was still okay, but I begin to get the sense that most games will play pretty much the same.

A game with a lot of potential for theme and zombie-filled fun.  For me,though, it's never lived up to that potential.  Most of the game is just about running away from zombies and drawing cards until you find the one you need, which isn't very thematic to me at all.  I'd like to play with the expansion, however, to see if it improves any.

Fun zombie game that is less complex than Dead of Winter. Can get a little complicated if there is one hero player managing 4 characters. Biggest gripe is that after two games, the heroes have won both times without a single death. It's too easy for the heroes to heal themselves and/or escape the zombies. Another issue is that almost every card had an aspect of ambiguity requiring us to look up an extensive FAQ. Good theme implementation though.

Very flavorful zombie-killing game. Very sturdy components, lovely game art. Best with two, three, or five players: having two zombie players isn't fun, especially for the zombies. Lot of replay potential thanks to the missions in the box and the developers website.
Not everyone in the group is a fan though. One player hates being the zombies because 'he just plays cards and just has to chase the hero's, the zombies can't win' but 'there's just too many zombies and the heroes have no HP, the heroes just can't win!'
Sold, not because I didn't like it (I do), but because it never hit the table.

I don't see how a zombie game could be better unless it involves fast zombies like in 28 Days Later. Slow plodding zombies are just kinda dull in board game format.

Rating assumes I'm playing it with the burrito boy (who loves this game, probably because he can beat me at it) and Hellhammer, age 5; with adults, this is a 6.  I love the look of the game--the pictures on the cards are the best thing about this game, and they make the map look kind of sad in comparison--and I like the different scenarios, but the gameplay is "just OK."  [i](Waaay[/i] better than [gameid=2471], though.  In particular, the idea of scenario search items, and being able to take specific cards from the discard pile at certain locations, are nice touches.)

Update: after a few more plays, it's grown on me some, to the point where I would consider bringing it out for light/non-gaming adults.

Update: I've played this several times with my regular group, and they liked it more than I thought they would, but the theme is the only thing carrying it.  I'm looking forward to them getting tired of it, because there's just not enough game there.  At least it plays fast enough...

2015-04-14: sent to Luftwaffe Flak.  If I'm going to play a zombie game, would probably always rather play Dead of Winter, unless you're a child, in which case the rating stands.

This is actually a pretty decent Zombie game. For me the crux of a good Zombie game is the storytelling/narrative of the struggle between the Humans and the Zombies.

LNoE is quite thematic and has all those wonderful zombie things we love. The game is pretty light but their are some interesting combat interactions available with the various item and event cards.

The Chainsaw, of course, is my favorite weapon - however, only because I haven't got to blow up a pack  of zombies with dynamite.

Multiple characters and multiple scenarios are nice.

The soundtrack, while absurd, is pretty cool.

It's like Descent, but last a couple of hours tops and is themed around Zombies.  Fun to play while watching a good zombie movie or around Halloween =)  A good beer and pretzel game with a slight (very slight) strategy element.  The mood and theme are well conveyed, quite narrative, but the novelty wears off and its too simple for my taste.

It's a typical American board game with action cards and dice rolling for simple combat.  If played with five players, there seems to be some significant downtime and, with four players, having two zombie players seems a bit unusual.  So, I think that it may be ideal for three players (one playing zombies and two players each with a pair of heroic townsfolk).

You should never play with more than 1 zombie player as there simply isn't enough to do to accommodate 2 zombies.

As most everyone has said, this is the most enjoyable zombie game I have ever played.  The game play was intense, and there is finally a game that gives a much better edge to Z.  I can't wait to get more in depth with this game, and I can bet this will move way up in rank. The card stock was great, but it was rather annoying taking the cards apart individually when I first opened the game.

RATING: 7.5
Very fun and highly thematic zombie game.  The choices each turn can be tense.  The scenarios add some variety to the gameplay, and the semi-cooperative play style seems to fit the survival horror genre.  The rules are light enough not to get in the way of the frantic, escape from the zombies storyline.  Scenarios Played : Save the Townsfolk, Escape in the Truck x2, Plague Carriers (GH exp.), Defend the Manor House, Burn Them Out, Die Zombies Die.

This is by far the best zombie boardgame I've ever played! Up to four players are fighting a zombie player, trying to complete some objectives: find gas for a car, kill zombies, protect a manor... The game has a fantastic B-movies flavour, and the design is awesome!
On the other hand, it can be very hard for the human players to win some scenarios. You'll have to be quite lucky and very strategic to protect the manor from invasion...
Anyway, I believe this is a must have for every zombie fan!

RATING: 6
After a few plays, I don't know where I stand on this game. My take is that playing as zombies is way more fun than playing as characters. The downsides with the characters are two-fold. First, if controlling all multiple characters there is a lot to keep track of (character abilities, items, weapons, events). I missed some items that would have saved a few character lives. Second, if playing as only a few characters (1 or 2) then there is a lot of downtime. Possibly it doesn't work very well with two players.

Traded.

RATING: 7
We didn't really enjoy [thing=35815][/thing], so we were a little wary of trying another Flying Frog game.  We definitely tilt towards the more Euro style of game, so these types of thematic games generally don't work for the two of us.  Still, I was intrigued by [thing=29368][/thing] since it seemed like the theme really came through in the game.  We ended up getting this in a trade and we gave it a try this Halloween.

The components are nice and thick cardboard and I didn't mind the graphic design.  We started with the [i]Escape in the Truck[/i] scenario, since it seemed to give a specific and thematic goal to the heroes.  I ended up playing the heroes, as it felt like it would be harder to juggle four different characters while she played the zombies.  Surprisingly, we enjoyed the game (well, I enjoyed it while she tolerated it, which was still a big step).  The biggest reason is that the theme really does come through, not just in the artwork and flavor text, but also in the gameplay itself.  In the Truck scenario, the heroes are frantically searching for the keys and a can of gas to get out of Dodge before the zombies eat them.  It seems to make sense and the mechanisms support the theme.  One of the problems with [thing=35815][/thing] is that it felt very abstract and arbitrary despite the thematic costuming---why am I randomly wondering around the countryside in circles?  Partly, I think this problem is attributable to the lack of a player that you're playing against.  The game feels like it lacks a soul.  Some cooperative games can get away with this type of abstract or puzzly feeling if the mechanisms behind the game are strong enough (such as in [thing=30549][/thing]), but this fails in a more complex and random random thematic game.  In contrast, in [thing=29368][/thing] you're playing directly against another human, so the choices that the zombies and humans make are much more tense.  

Still, the game is very random, so you have to be in the mood for that.  It's not really a complex strategy game.  With two players, one player will have to juggle four hero characters, which is not ideal.  Plus, I think these types of thematic games really need a group of people to really get the feel and excitement out.  We'll have to wait to bring this out with a larger group of people.

Although a decent american type game (lots of theme), The downtime is to much for a game where luck has the biggest drive... Luck factor is very steep!

RATING: 5
On the one hand, zombies. On the other hand, the rules. The game is pretty and the theme is strong, but it has some serious flaws. Heroes are heavily dependent on finding items that are too hard to both find and hang onto, the Heroes are not well-balanced with each other, and it's easy for one side or the other to be saddled with a hopeless scenario that they can't do much to salvage. I use this as a gateway game with horror buffs, but otherwise it only comes out when specifically requested.

If you need a thematic B-movie zombie fix and think cards like "Undead Hate the Living" are hilarious, this is for you. There's usually enough strategy to keep it interesting, at least between the laughs.

If you're looking for a finely balanced game with little randomness, look elsewhere. If the zombies luck out and take over the farmhouse half of your characters are holed up in, it's probably all over.

This is a different kind of "gateway" game.  Though it isn't rooted in the Euro light strategy genre, non-gamers jump right into a game of this and have fun hamming up the zombie thing.  Having the strong theme is appealing to them.  Maybe next I'll steer them into something slightly more abstract like Ticket to Ride or Settlers of Catan.

Good: Great theme, tension builder, outstanding components, not too bad to teach. Bad: You know a game with this many dice is going to be luck heavy but no amount of strategy seems to matter which is a bit disappointing. Downtime for Zombie players turn vs Hero players turns was horrible. Players turn takes a few seconds each but Zombie Master takes FOREVER. Conclusion: Ok game. Make sure Zombie player is familiar with Zombie deck to help minimize downtime. Overall I can think of better ways to spend 2-3 hours but some of my non-gamer friends really like this and I don't refuse to play it with them.

RATING: 7.8
What I like the most at this game is the fact that there are two different play styles which must be balanced. I find this difficult to achieve in any game (pc, board game etc). Also the fact that it is scenario based ads a lot of replayability because each player can come up any time with new scenarios more interesting then actual scenarios (although actual scenarios are very interesting). The only minus of the scenarios is the fact that the producers doesn't suggest players to try scenarios that players and zombies have a mission to do. For example in all scenarios players must do something and zombies must stop them. I would like from the producers to come with something like: players to something, zombies do something and each one have a choice to stop the other. Of course players can do a scenario like this but it should come as an example from the producers.

Overall the game is very fun specially when multiple players are involved in the game. Also I like the theme of the game and I think it works very good with the game-play.

What would have make the fight much more interesting is if the producers would have user special dices instead of normal D6 dices. Something like in Earth Reborn. I thing it would have made the fight much more dynamic.

Luck and randomness count in this game but not that much as some people say ... without right tactic players can't win even if luck is on their side. I believe if there neither of the two elements are not involved fun factor loses some points.

Another disadvantage of this game is 1v1 game because the hero player must play with four heroes. Its kinda hard to manage all the abilities and stuff of all four heroes. I did some plays in 1v1 with only 2 heroes, 7 zombies and 2 L shapes (instead of four) ad it plays quite nice ... so this is a workaround for those that find this problem irritating. 

I recommend this game because is very fun, has great theme, lot of replayability, players can customize game with new scenarios and also two different play stiles.

Advantages:
- very fun
- high player interaction
- two different play styles
- lot of replayability
- easy-medium to learn
- high quality package content

Disadvantages: 
- not a lot of strategy required
- luck can count a lot in some situations
- difficult for the hero player in 1v1 to play with 4 heroes
- some cards are not explained very well

starting to drop with more plays.  

I think as I play other games, I'm starting to realize some of the weakness in the rules of this.   just some vagueness in the rules that I don't enjoy "fixing on the fly".   

Other than that, its furious fast fun.   

Definetely check out the web scenarios. the more indepth scenarios are better.

It’s simply the definitive zombie game. 

Though movement is still dice driven, character abilities and event cards create offsets to the detriments of the movement, and truly most of the flaws you might find here. I also enjoy that the game play is simple to the point that AP shouldn’t ever have a home, and that the turns are bite sized enough that the game moves along briskly. Further, since combat often occurs on both zombie and hero turns there always seems like something to do. The objectives also seem well balanced and impress a sense of urgency and tension heretofore unseen in other games of its ilk.

This one is already slated for our Halloween party, and it’s certain to see more than one play that day; certainly many more to come.

Update:

Years later and newer designs have made this virtually obsolete.

[microbadge=419][microbadge=2135]

Last Night on Earth has a few things to offer.  It does create a legitimate zombie game where you fight out zombie battles, and it does look pretty good doing it.  After that, things sort of fall apart.  Combat is ineffective, rules are clever but overly complicated, and the scenarios, while varied, are not properly developed.  For the moment, I'm more interested in Mall of Horror or Dead of Winter as a zombie game.

Amazing Production (A bit over produced on the cards they are like shuffling credit cards)  Great 1st effort.  The 1st scenario can be a bit tough if you draw the wrong characters.

Like my buddy said he will never play Zombies!! again without using the character tokens from this game lol

A roll and move game.  But the game is not terrible.  You roll around gaining items which will help you to fight the boss at the end of the game.  Also, there are NPC's that help you during the game but can be corrupted to evil and work against you in the final fight.  

The game runs really long for what it is.  It also has the "acted" artwork that some people do not like but I don't mind it.  Overall, the components of the game are good but the gameplay is meh.  I would rather play a deeper strategy game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Used to be a 7, but with each play of the game it becomes more and more obvious to me that after the novelty has worn off, I can't make myself to like the game. The game just drags, single turns are boring, and there's a hideous amount of luck involved - even more so with introducing expansion cards which should, in theory, add some good alternatives to cards which are not used a lot.

I feel kind of sorry that I spent so much money on this, the expansion, and the small card expansions. I'm afraid that, even though the production quality is absolutely wonderful, I will decide to sell this off at some point.

30.06.2012 - played this again after a loooong time and instantly remembered why I hated it. This is not a game, this is a random, boring card/dice fest with no real options or decision-making. The only way this can be fun is if you make fun of the game and the situations - but even so, it'll be just mediocre. Will attempt to gift it during this year's Secret Santa - if that fails, I'm selling it at the next possibility.

I feel no need to ever play this again.

This game could have been fun: basically a GM vs players type of game, it features several missions, and a set of characters, each with his own abilities, to pick for the game.
Unfortunately, it has a very clunky and ill devised set of rules which makes the whole experience a lot less fun. Basically, it's all luck in the first rounds, and, after that, the game tends to be very one-sided, depending on who got lucky at the beginning.
Not recommended.

I really enjoyed playing this game.  This really gives the feeling of being in a zombie movie.  The theme really shows in this game and that's a huge plus for me.  The quality of the cards and bits are amazing.  Except for the art on the game board itself.  It just looks very amatuerish.  

The game takes some time to learn because there are a lot of rules but it isn't overly complex.  If you take the time to learn it (which should be 15 min at least) then you'll be fine.  You will have to refer to the rules once or twice but no biggie.

A lot of fun bashing zombies in a archetypical backwoods small town. Basic game play is simple and smooth, but the expansions add a lot of weight and occasionally slow it down a bit. The game is also a bitch to set-up, when you have to study the scenario-specific rules and explain them to the other players. This is mostly a problem with the expansions however. Although without the expansion(s) the game is a wee bit too simple and somewhat lacks replayability.

This game is a lot of fun, siding most of the players together against a horde of zombies.  The balance, at least in basic, seems to be weighted really well.  I'm looking forward to more plays in the future.

Crap zombies!!  A miniatures game with a little card drawing, and dice rolling.  Time is spent seaching rooms, and running from the undead.  sometimes you draw a good weapon and sometimes you die.  Zombie movie in a box.  I like it.

This is pretty obviously the game that Zombies from Twilight Creations wants to be when it grows up. I'm not sure that's saying much, however, because after one trial run with the basic game I'd still rather play a real roleplaying game. Possibly the advanced scenarios have more non-obvious choices to offer.
Played once.

Quick comment about the game. I subtract -.2 points for the stuck together cards. Otherwise this is truly the best zombie game I have ever had the pleasure of playing.Updated: I am still playing LNoE at least once a month and still having a blast with it. It easily deserves the 9.8 I have given it, even with the stuck together cards.

Absolutely fantastic game. My only complaint is they haven't done any new online scenarios lately. You can play 2-6 people and have no change to the game or strategy.

RATING: 7
A fun little romp. Very cinematic. I can see the gameplay getting a tad boring for the zombies without an objective.
The board artwork leaves a bit to be desired. The cards and the use of photography are great and add to the cinematic feel. This just earned a spot on my wishlist. I can see pulling this out once or twice a year (especially around Halloween).

I am not much of a board gamer, but this game may change all of that. My friends and I have not had this much fun since we played RISK back in high school, and considering we are all in our late thirty's that is saying something.  Excellent, quick, easy, and fun game.  Can't get enough.

I find that the kind of game that captivates me most these days are games where I become immersed in the setting and the game mechanics evoke the theme that they are trying to depict.

Some of my favorite games do this so well: Arkham Horror, Railroad Tycoon, Fury of Dracula, DOOM: The Boardgame, Dungeon Lords, and my absolute favorite of all, Man O'War. 

Add one more game to that list of immensly satisfying and entertaining games, because Last Night on Earth not only captures the feeling of a Zombie Apocalypse, it does it with simple mechanics and intuitive gameplay. LNoE also is unique in that the artwork for the game is done in a "B" movie style format and all the characters in the game are potrayed by actors and photographed as if they are in scenes from a movie.

This has the effect of creating a story as you play, one that is every bit as engaging as a zombie movie, yet significantly more enjoyable! 

Being the 1st game from Flying Frog Productions, you would think that there would be gaps in the productions or game play or design, yet that is not the case at all. LNoE plays with few referals to the rules, the things you do make sense from a game standpoint AND from a thematic standpoint and there are always new and unusual things that come up during a game.

Last Night on Earth is only made better with all the expansions and it has steadily risen in my ratings to become a game that I almost always want to play (time allowing) and one that I can see bringing many years of enjoyment down the road.

Terrific game that really captures the feel of cheesy zombie movies.  The different scenarios keep it fresh, and the adversarial element of zombie player(s) vs. hero player(s) makes for a great experience.  An instant classic and I can't wait to see the expansions.

Funny and little demanding game you can play with everyone. The components are one of the best I've ever seen, and the photographic art is very funny and ironic.
The only part that I dont't like is the art of the board, that doesn't fit the quality of the rest of the game.

Had to lower the score. The game's fun factor depends heavily on the group you play the game with, as well as on the zombie player's attitude. I guess I have also played too much of it recently, so it got a bit tedious. 

UPDATE. We had a really good zombie player last time, with all the "urghhs" and "braaains", plus a really good scenario (Defend the Mansion). It turned out to be the best LNoE experience I'd ever had.

You don't get much value for your money. I was pretty disappointed when I saw what's in the box. You get more zombies, cards, heroes, scenarios, board tiles and many new tokens but it doesn't change the base game much. It cost almost the same as the base game...

10/16/2007: Tentative rating after two games.  The best zombie game I've tried.  Great narrative and length for the game you get out of it.  The two scenarios I've played have been well-balanced and exciting.  It's [b]Maul of America[/b] done right; there are always 4 heroes (divided up between 1 - 4 players) and 14 zombies (divided up between 1 and 2 players), so the scenarios are always balanced (before accounting for luck).  The cards and mechanics lead to a B-movie zombie atmosphere, perfect for the game.10/23/2007: after a third game, I find myself wanting to play more and more.  Raised a half-point to 8.

After several plays with different types of people, this game has been enjoyed every single time.  Sure it has dice and cards and can be a bit random, but there are still plenty of decisions to be made, the theme really hits home and it's just plain fun.  Don't play with more than 4 though.

Did a "dummy" play of the Basic Game the other day, just to see how the mechanics work.  Initial setup was three students with no high school or gym, so all in the middle, and the priest in the Church.  Zombie player's initial draw included a My God!  They've Taken Over... card, which was promptly played on the church.  Given a high starting roll for the zombies, there were only three zombies to place in the church, but it was enough--they killed him on the second turn.  In retrospect, I should probably have tried to use the priest's special ability. In addition, I think I messed up a rule about the number of Zombie cards that can be played during a fight (I believe the limit's one).  Final score after the second hero died was 9 zombies killed, 11 turns till sundown.

A very theme-heavy dice roller, where situations can change with a single roll. Unpredictable, raw and brutal. Just like a zombie apocalypse should be!

Very long game.  We have played twice and are still figuring out mechanics/strategies.  Instruction manual is terrible, which is a shame since it is not a simple game.

Played half a game once.... I don't play role playing games usualy. Also my gaming mates are mostly enginners and don't like too much luck involved in games. This game is based on luck and dice rolling. It doesn't bother me that much here even that I don't like dices too. I mostly bought it because it looks gorgeous :P
It's hard for me to rate it. Would need to play few more times. But this might be hard with my mates....

The game is nice and simple, the mechanics work well and the game moves very quickly (which is good).

I like it how they used photos of people and photoshop to make the cards (Its the Modern thing to do lol), but at the same time the artwork is shocking, The cardboard tiles are really badly drawn and the photos just make the game look cheap.

It is a very pricey game for what you get. 
It is a fun game and if I wasn't doing Graphic design then I would be fine with the photos/artwork. 

The music Cd that comes with the game is... well its something else haha

You can feel the influence of games like Doom and Descent when playing Last Night on Earth, but LNoE is not as fiddly, plays a lot quicker and, ultimately, is just a lot more fun.

RATING: 8
The more I play it, the more I love it. It certainly has its flaws, but they are more than made up for. I still am amazed at how tense the game feels all the way through. I think that one of the major problems people have is due to the fact that the zombies can play pretty stupidly and still win pretty easy(thematically totally perfect) while the heroes need to play strategically and work together well to pull off the win. For me though, I don't mind not winning if I had a great time playing, and this always delivers.

RATING: 8
Played for the first time with 6 players. It was a very fun game. Cooperative play was fun. The game shifted between the humans and zombies as a critical moment. The feeling that the game could go either way was present the entire time we played. There is a constant feeling that zombies are closing in on you and there is nowhere to hide that added more suspense to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I was expecting this to be a fun beer & pretzels games where players got drunk and did bad zombie impressions. And it's all that, of course, but more. The game is fast and really quite tense with the "lead" switching sides multiple times every play. Decisions are not obvious either, with the heroes never sure whether to search or run or risk dismembering some zombies and perhaps more impressively there's actually some interesting movement decisions for the zombies to make trying to cordon off the heroes and make the most of their feeble movement. Lightweight gaming doesn't come much better than this.

I have possibly played this one too much and it's losing the shine. Removing the expansions and messing with the optional rules may resurrect it, but I think Invasion From Outer Space gives the antagonist player much more to do.

Best zombie themed game I remember having played. Has some odd things, even more so if you have all expansions integrated. But still the most thematic zombie game out there.

RATING: 8
Reminiscent of playing M:tg with restricted cards. There are a lot of good, stock cards and some amazing "bombs" to continue the M:tg vernacular. 

In a nutshell the rules are fine with some notable exceptions. The development on the other hand, is not good. 

Random movement for heroes is irksome. I'd preffer the option to 'take 3' or roll (ala DnD 3rd edition)

The ammo/breakage rolls add an extra layer of chrome that may add to the theme or, dare I say, mood of the game. However it adds a superfluous rule that bogs down already slow game play. 

The game promises replayability with different character combinations and scenarios. Whether or not the game delivers remains to be seen.

This is the least elegant game I've ever played.  I'd rather play tic-tac-toe than this game.  Sooooo many rules.  Sooooo many exceptions.  Sooooo many arguments over the exact rules based on the scnario and the card that's been played and wether there's another hero next to you... wait... is that a ZOMBIE hero? Well I have a card that can give them gasoline but the keys are in the pocket of someone who's humping in the back seat.  Can someone else get the keys off him...  UGGG. The game fits the theme and that's the best thing I can say.

This is a game that runs on hype.  I bought into it and bought the game.  Then I played the game and learned that sometimes hype is bad.

This isn't a bad game but it's a game that doesn't make me want to play it.  When I played my first session there wasn't 'wow' but rather oh... well that was ok.  I treid a few other games but each time I was just playing to play a game... not because I was really raring to put this one through it's paces.

I've played this a couple of times. It's OK. Kind of entertaining, but a veteran zombie master vs. newbie humans will soon be having brains for lunch without much challenge. In addition, the cards are random and not evenly distributed as far as power goes. Luck of the draw can give one side victory over the other before the game even begins. I'll play LNoE, but I won't expect to get much satisfaction out of it, and I'll probably be wishing I was playing something else. 
I'm probably a hypocrite and may lose credibility for saying this but, while I don't much like Last Night on Earth: the Zombie Game, I LOVE A touch of Evil, The Supernatural Game. I'd rather kill monsters than zombies any day! :)

I've only played this game twice. My last game was so frustrating -- absolutely everything that could have gone wrong for my faction went wrong -- that I'm having trouble getting past that. Honestly, I'm not a sore loser. But I'm not anxious to return to a game where I get a kick in the head every turn for an a hour and a half. 

Still, I think the fact that the game is scenario-based gives it a lot of potential for variety and fun.

... I didn't understand the point of playing this... 

the scenario was to find car keys and gas for the car .. they were somewhere in the deck... it turned out that the zombie player got some action to discard like 10 cards from the deck and they contained the car keys... so the human players lost?... it seemed really dumb.

One basic play with two players - incredibly tight and thrilling endgame - the heroes won just by a hairbreadth after 12 rounds. I did not expect this at all.
Second session with four (basic) - the Heroes lost in round 9 due to bad play on their side. Still a great game.
More plays to come ...
The soundtrack would fit to a modern vampire game, though - it simply adds nothing to this game, IMHO.

Outstanding game. It has a great atmosphere, excellent production values and you would think it's a fun light brainless gore-fest but to my greatest surprise it isn't just that. It has many strategy in there to keep every single game tense up to the last turn. There was hardly a game where the outcome has been decided way before the last few turns, and thanks to the great core system there are so many profoundly different scenarios to choose from, that the game has a tremendous replayability.

Great game.  There are a lot of rules and clarifications when first playing but it is a great party game where new scenarios can be created.  We even created our own characters with abilities to mimic ourselves and our own traits.  Have fun with it and you will love it!

It seemed like a good game when I bought it but it hasn't stood the test of time. It's ok but rather haphazard and random. 

Everything depends on the card draws so much so it often feels like the game is playing you.

I was originally under the impression that this was a purely cooperative game, but it's actually a team game, with a group of Heroes vs. a group of Zombies.  While I was initially concerned about that, I ended up greatly enjoying this game, as it feels extremely balanced between the two parties and has an amazingly engrossing theme.  The soundtrack provided isn't spectacular, but seriously, how many games have you played which come with their own music?  I feel like this game took the typical mindless zombie game and turned it into something with serious strategy, great replay value, and extremely fun gameplay.  Although it has recently been replaced by the superior Betrayal at House on the Hill, this is still a very fun large-group game, and I hope we get to play it more often.

Extremely fun and flavorful game. Played around Halloween and the theme was great! Not a fan of the CD but that is just a bonus anyways. There is definitely great tension and balance between the zombies and the heroes. The games lasts just the right amount of time. The art is fitting, components are good, and gameplay is smooth and simple. I think the instructions are somewhat lacking in some areas but the online FAQs make up for this.

Game in a Nutshell:  B-movie flavored scenarios pitting Team Zombies vs. Team Humans in a fight for survival or brains.

Played as: 3,4,6 player

Pros: The sense of theme and tension is immediatly apparent, trash-talking is abundant, and there's loads of high-tension dice rolls with groans or cheers to follow. I'm a big fan of how they presented the game which further drives home how the experience plays out like a campy horror flick. Loads of hilariousity. Just a smashing success in thematic story-telling game design. 

Cons: Sure, sound decision making is important, but if you're looking for strategic depth, you'll be left hungry. This also leads to boring down-time (little to plan or concentrate on) if played with people who can't keep the game moving. More balance in the scenarios would be nice.  

Other: I haven't been able to try playing as the Zombies yet but so far it seems that either side is equally enjoyable which isn't always true for asymetrical design. Also, I listened to the CD but haven't used it during the game... I didn't think it was as bad as people made it out to be.

Best Use: Great game for cutting loose and playing out a story.

A friend had this. I insisted on playing on the human team until we won. We played at least 8 times and the humans never won. Then he quoted great victories in which high school jock obtained a chainsaw, strapped it to a baseball bat (or something) and mowed the lawn of zombies. Far too random for me.

RATING: 6
After many plays, I have a very strong opinion that this is an okay game with a great theme. It's not, unfortunately, the slam dunk I thought it might be.

I like the components. I like the look of the maps. I like the character art. I like the theme. I like the box art. I like the insert. I'm pretty sure I like this game for what it is--light, fun, brutal, easy to learn.

However, at least one of the scenarios is a total dog, some of the cards are odd (in a bad way), there are a few grey areas in the rules and there's something generally missing that I can't quite put my finger on. It pains me to give it a 6. But it is a 6.

Trashy, enjoyable game. Rules are imbalanced, gameplay is not particularly deep, some scenarios are somewhat broken, but it doesn't matter in the slightest. This is not a well balanced, well designed game: this is a beer and pretzels game that oozes theme and plays out exactly like a zombie B-Movie, complete with all the clichés of typical zombie movies. That said, it's awesome. 

There are so many instances in this game that will make you laugh. That time the zombies ate player A and C while they were getting it on in the Police Station? Classic. That time the previously helpless priest saved the day (and won the game) by pushing zombies back with a fire extinguisher and blowing them up with dynamite? You'll remember that one fondly. No one cares if they win or lose, whether they were hopelessly outnumbered or the game was ridiculously unbalanced: it's all about the journey.

Only gripe is the elimination of players, making for bored people wishing they could get back into the game. I've fixed this with house rules: when killed humans always turn into zombie heroes which are played by the same player. To ensure they feel like they're contributing to the zombie team (they don't control a group of zombies, just the zombie hero), they're movement is still D6 and fight combat and wounds are identical to that of heroes (can still move through walls like other zombies). Quite literally a hero for the zombie team, who actively contributes in making things all the more difficult for a 25% smaller hero team. Heroes can no longer sit in a building and continually search while zombies slowly make their way forward, there is a faster, stronger creature ready to prey on the slow and foolhardy. That'll teach 'em for letting their friends die.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There doesn't seem to be a lot going on while playing this.  You either search (draw cards) or move.  And yet, the further along you get, the more the suspense builds until everone is on the edge of their seats to see if the heroes will be able to pull off a victory (by rolling good dice) against the unending tide of zombies.

One of my very favorite "story" board games - everyone I've introduced the game to loves it and it's usually the first thing my adult group will choose to play.

I've also played this game with the kids (ages 13-18) at the after-school game club I run and they LOVE it.

The important point with this game is that the story and the play experiences are much more important than who wins or loses - there's a high degree of luck involved in this game but that's what makes it so special and what makes those times when the heroes scratch out a victory so memorable.

This game is just plain and simply FUN!!! The board is big enough to give the Hero's some good movement options, but small enough for the zombie's to corner the Heroes.

The combat is simple, but with the added cards can make the fights strategic and challenging.

The only reason this game does not get a solid 10 is the glossy cards...

They stick like crazy making shuffling a nightmare...

Most of the mechanisms are broken: you depend almost entirely on luck. Most good games either have dice rolling in them play a not-so-important-part, or they offer you some control over what you roll (modifiers to the rolls and whatnot). That is almost non-existant on this game. I actually played a game in which the other human player and me rolled 2 or 3 succeses at most, and the zombie player missed once, or maybe twice...

The art is something I dislike as well, but I since it's done like that purpose, going for that look of z-class horror movies... meh...

I love this game. I love Romero zombies. I love games that are co-op. I love games that have a bit of strategy mixed with roleplay. LNOE does these well to my mind. The theme is so spot on its scary, the characters are taken direct from every pulpy horror film you've ever watched and the production value is awesome. Only gripe? 5 scenarios was never going to be enough, expansions and web only releases fill a void but more than five would have been good.

Hm, there is something to it...

At first I was let down by the simplicity of this game, but after trying it with a right bunch of five, I must say this game can be a lot of lightweight braineating fun!

Minis are decent, cards are some of the best I have seen thus far in a game, character and scenario sheets are massive and premium, and chits are ok. Alas, the gameboard is somewhat of a disappointment...

All in all, cute to have, but not a must.

At first I hated this game. It seemed like the Zombies were far too dominant and could counter everything the humans could do. Slowly though the fact that the humans could run away a lot meant they had a chance. This is a dicey, highly thematic and pacey game that ended up appealing to me quite a bit. I like it that the humans always feel one turn away from losing, that definitely fits well with the theme. Overall: Nice one!

I really like the game, but for the sake of simplicity I've only ever done the "kill all the zombies" mode.  This is just because every time I've played it I've been introducing it to a new group and it's just been easier than having to learn the scenario myself.  It captures the B-Movie vibe quite well.

RATING: 8.5
Played once with four people.  This is a co-op action game wherein players play either heroes or the zombies that are trying to eat the heroes.  Regardless of the number of players there are always 4 heroes and up to 14 zombies on the board, and one person always controls the zombies.  Heroes are underpowered at first, but can get items (cards) in buildings that give them better chances to fight off the zombies.  Fights are easy and quick to resolve, and the game overall felt very balanced.  For instance, heroes have a good chance of "fending off" zombies right from the start, but have trouble killing them without weapons; even when the heroes do get weapons, every time they're used they have a chance of breaking.  

The game has multiple scenarios that come with it, and I look forward to playing more of them.  I absolutely love that only one of the scenarios focuses on killing the zombies; all the rest focus on the heroes having to actually carry out some task (and it not mattering at all how many zombies they kill).  I also love that the game is co-op; this leads to lots of player interaction and lots of players helping players.

Suprisingly I actually liked the components and photos as it added to the game. When I saw images I always thought it looked a little tacky. But in person it works nice and adds to the game.

But playing the game was a big let down. It could have been the people I was playing with, but for the whole short game I stood in one room rolling ones so I just stood there searching the deck and getting nothing.

Will try again as I want to enjoy this, but as of now a very bad experienće.

More or less a filler game without any depth. The mechanics are extremely simplistic and the game as a whole lacks any thematic tension.

After a few 2 player games of this, we really enjoy it.

I've started playing Wednesday nights at the local hobby shop; this one seems to be a favorite, particularly among the Magic players. There was outrage the week I didn't bring it.

We got our money's worth out of it, but I feel like I'm done with Last Night on Earth. It's good for what it is, but the randomness of the dice and, more importantly, the card draws, can be irksome. The zombie player usually wins this one. Heck, regardless of the reason (and those reasons felt forced) I'm just done. I have friends who like it, and the bottom of the box is pretty messed up, so it's not likely to be trade bait anytime soon...

Gave this to Fons.

Die Zombies, Die! (starting scenario)

Our 2-player game was incredibly tense, the zombies destroyed the human team; due in part to lucking out with some good cards in the early game. Various mishaps and strategical errors by the human team added buckets of theme to the game. Prompting the purchase of GH, SotF, and TP from BGG:marketplace. 

Our 4-player game was the opposite. A blow away victory for the human team. Hanging out in the gun room removed a lot of difficulty. Playing unique characters really added to the story from a first person perspective. Really looking forward to some of the more challenging scenarios!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This one is all about the theme, but it somehow manages to capture that theme so perfectly. The game has this way of arranging moments that are almost cliched tropes of zombie horror films: the sherrif's son, because of his teen angst is turned into a zombie, and goes to eat his father. The father, too distraught to kill his own son is also turned into a zombie. The brave ex-military cook from the diner, stages a distraction so the farm girl and the priest can get away in the truck. And on and on.

The components are exquisite, the game play is surprisingly balanced, the box and the expansion come cram-packed with extras to encourage players to make their own little scenarios, etc.

Yes, it's schlocky, and there is not a lot of deep thinking or strategy involved. For instance, the main mechanic to move heroes around the board literally is roll-and-move. But somehow, none of that seems to matter. When you get in the middle of the game, you end of having so much fun that the light nature of the game is unimportant.

I like the cinematic look of the cards, the game components are durable, and the layout/setup is random enough to give it pretty fair replay value, especially for my girls. It may have helped that my daughter loved the voices I was supplying the entire game for each of the characters. Last: The cd was a great idea. Overall: Great fun. Enjoy!

While this game certainly is pure Ameritrash and involves a fair amount of luck just the thrill of playing again Zombies makes this game jolly good fun. I think this game plays best with 4-6 players even though you can play with fewer.

OMG zombies are the coolest thing ever. I own this and every expansion for it. Can not tell how many times I've played, always having a really good time. Best time of my life omg this is such a fun game. The CD included with thematic music, holy shit some good stuff right there. I also have my own playlist just for this game. Bought some brains and severed hand replicas etc. also that I like to take out when playing this.

A lot of luck is however involved: a bit too much for my taste for this to be a 10. Some missions might end turn 3-4 when the survivors just happen to find the 3 things they need. I always play zombies, zombies are cool. I have painted almost every model; should/could possibly post some pictures some day.

One of my earlier additions to my collection - a very thematic zombie game in a B-horror movie style that has one player acting out the zombie characters while the others act out the heroes. Tension, but feels pretty shallow in terms of any kind of challenging or exciting decisions. Dumb fun.

A fun dice-rolling zombie game where one (or two) players are the zombies trying to kill the hero players.
Heroes are able to find weapons, items and event cards to help them survive the zombie onslaught.
I like the fact that the zombies are player controlled as this makes it more challenging for the hero players.

RATING: 7
I keep changing my opinion of LNoE, at first I hated it and supported those who slagged it off, but the more I played it the more I liked it!

The game is still a little too swingy at times, but it's  a good zombie game with interesting scenarios and possibly the most fun playing as 'Overlord' as you'll ever get!

It also has manly, dangerous zombies that can be terribly tough to defeat and most of the time are better just avoiding (something which seems to be rare in the recent flood of zombie games).

However, the expansion Growing Hunger is essential in several ways and improves the game ten-fold!

I'd rate it as low as 6/10 on it's own, but at least 8/10 with Growing Hunger included, the expansion really is that good!

As with A Touch of Evil be careful of the number of expansions you invest in though, as it will bloat the game to unplayability.

Progressive Rating: 5-4-5-6-8-7.

A game that shows a lot of potential after just one play. I didn't really enjoy playing a 6 player game since I had to share the zombies with someone else, but I think that a better scenario then the starting "Die Zombies, Die" and having only 5 players would help that.

RATING: 9
I just love this game. Its camp, zombie fun that can't be taken too seriously. It can drag a little bit, and anything more that 4 players creates too much downtime for the human players. I haven't tried this as a 2-player game but I suspect that part of the fun is the feel of cooperation between the humans. I wouldn't play this game all the time as the theme might wear a bit thin but its a hoot for occassional play with people who have social skills and an appreciation for the ludicrous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
This is a game in which the zombie theme and mechanics work well and mesh together so that you feel like you are playing in a film. The B movie artwork and characters add to that effect.
I like the centre of the board being faster to transverse than the surrounding buildings. 
My only concern is that the scenario objective may mean that the Hero Deck has to be gone through to get one of the very few objective cards. But if you plan the scenario by laying out suitable building tiles at the start this should not impact the game play.
RECOMMENDED for Zombie fans!

RATING: 7
Does a good job with zombie theme. I'd like to play it more. Don't feel like I've had a chance to figure it out yet. 

UPDATED: I've had the chance to try this out more recently. I really enjoy the stories that this game tends to build. By the time the game is over, you have a story to tell. 

I still rate it a 7. I don't always want to play it, but I'd rarely turn down a game. Although you shouldn't expect a perfectly balanced game with this, I feel like wins are fairly well split between zombies and heroes.

Played: 7 times.

This will be the game I break out every October.  LNOE is a simple yet addictive game that drips with theme and provides a good narrative; clearly a labor of love. Yes, it's a dicefest, but that's ameritrash, baby!  There is some luck, but good strategy, player cooperation, and card management usually carries the day, err...night.  

I like the use of photography and models for the characters as it adds to the whole 'B' movie vibe and makes the characters more "real."  (The hero profiles at the end of the rulebook are a nice touch). My one minor quibble is that the map art could have been better.  The "town center" is only a grassy field with an old well when it could have depicted a park with a gazeebo, fountain, etc.  Also, I would have liked the town area to have concrete instead of grass connecting the buildings. The CD is a nice, but unnecessary, touch. I was hoping for Bauhaus-like music and fearing a bad 70's porn soundtrack, but it's neither.  It sounds like atmospheric new age music (and well done at that).  Overall, LNOE is a great game and I look forward to the expansions (please give me an urban environment!).

A pretty fun zombie game, though I would much rather just play Zombicide or Dawn of the Zeds. The roll and move doesn't bother me here that much though, and I like the narrative that this game tells.

Played this for the first time at GenCon '08 and had a blast.  I think it was the burn it to the ground scenario.  Lately, I've managed to play it a few times with my daughters, 10 and 14, and it has gone over surprisingly well.  Helped that the first game was suitably dramatic.  We played "Escape in the Truck."  Jenny the farm girl was dusting zombies left and right, and Johnny had managed to fill up the truck with gas.  Problem was, while everyone was looking for keys, the zombie hordes converged on the truck in a swarming mass.  At the last minute they were blown to bits with some dynamite, and the heroes just barely managed to run to the truck, start 'er up, and take off.

Anyway, like as with Buffy, my 14 y.o. likes the action, and it's nice to see her and her sis cooperate and applaud each other's rolls.  The game is listed as 12+, but the mechanics are simple enough for my 10 y.o. to grasp.  Played for some goofy fun, it's a solid game.

My main criticism is that there are just too many cards.  I get a little tired of games that overutilize cards, and this game has its share of players digging through their cards because they can't remember what effects they've got that might be useful.  This also makes it a hard game to introduce to casual gamers.

Edit'14:  I still enjoy the game, for what it is.  At its best, it is a cinematic drama, and it's more fun when players are laughing over the in-game tropes.  The game is sooo swingy, though, in experience.  What cards come up when completely determines the experience of a scenario.

RATING: 7
In this zombie themed game, one (or two) players are the zombies, and the rest are heroes running around town. As players, roll the dice and move. There are strategic objectives one tries to achieve, such as killing 15 zombies, or rescuing four townsfolk.

It's a fun thematic game, that comes with a CD for music. It is heavily luck dependent and it is more of an experience game. There is lots of favour, and as the players, there is a ton of tension as the zombies close in on you. Just don't try to play this game too strategically.

This game is sloppy.  Some of the scenarios require that you find individual cards such as 'keys' and 'gasoline' from a *huge* deck, with the ability to draw only one card a turn.  We've had games like this where the zombie player didn't even have to do anything because the humans couldn't find the cards in time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great components, fun scenarios and just an all-round good game. It's not the deepest experience, but it's zombies so who's expecting deep. There is a lot of luck involved in the game, due to the use of both cards AND dice. Overall it's really good fun.

The only downside I would say is that I really don't recommend it with more than one zombie player. They simply don't have enough to do when there are two, and it makes an already difficult game really hard for the survivors to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Some clever things here, but seems to be very crowd-specific.  I may have to re-rate this when I play it with a group of players more in tune with the theme.

---update---
As suspected, the group makes a huge difference.  It's also important to recognize that this is an experience game - if you go in with the goal of winning, you're doing it wrong.  This is about having some heavily themed fun first and foremost.  Luck can dominate a playing, but fortunately play time is short enough that it shouldn't overstay its welcome.  I'm keeping my initial rating of 6, but the fun value with the right people in the right mindset can bring the experience up a couple points.

The game play feels flawed, but it could very well be the how the first scenario is set up. I didn't enjoy it and I feel like the zombie player/s have a distinct advantage. As a human I felt limited and like I wasn't really making decisions because of all the cards in the zombie deck that can cancel what you are trying. Fighting is wonky in that zombies are almost impossible to kill.

LNoE was my gateway game into ameritrash territory and I never looked back. This game captivated me with its simplicity to capture the theme of a zombie flick.

Really fun game and a real nail biter. I have not played with just the normal game but with at least Growing Hunger, Survival of the Fittest, and the Hero Pack the game is really fun from 2-6 players. Teams used to be balanced but with the later expansions it's a lot easier to win as the zombies.

edit - I have everything for the game as of 10/2014 and the zombies are too powerful. Humans only win if they get incredibly lucky and that just isn't fun. Trying to figure out a house rule to make the game more even.

RATING: 6
Nice ideas, but takes way too long for what it is. At least it's the best of the dice fest zombie games out there. Expansions seem to have destroyed the game quite a bit (adding lots of complicated stuff that doesn't add anything except for time and frustration).

RATING: 6
Dripping with theme, fun hour to hour-and-a-half game, that will have people humorously praising or cursing their dice and quoting a plethora of movie lines.  I consider this game great since it became a must-have after playing it for the first time and I am not even a horror movie or zombie fan.

Update:  After the excitement of how similar this game is to horror movies, it becomes quite fiddly especially with the expansion as there are a lot of things to keep track of and the uneven struggle of the zombies vs the heroes which people claim is not really there when expert players are at it, but I don't have the time to solely devote to this game as to become an expert.  Thus, this game became one I wasn't particularly excited to play again.

Out of the flood of zombie games we've seen the last decade, this seems to be the one that gets it most right. Simple rules at the core, yet the characters you play still offer variation.
Might be slightly unbalanced in favour of the zombies, yet every game I've played has been a close affair. Momentum seemingly swings back and forth a lot though.

1 zombie player VS 4 survivors. Never liked that setup.
Way to often, the best strategy for the survivors is to stand around and do nothing (search, actually).
Very random, with a few very powerful cards, and a lot of dice rolling.

Want to get more plays under my belt so this rating is tentative. So far had one AMAZING game, one alright game, and one sleep deprived game with very little feeling. This game has a lot of potential for the right group. 2 of my group are huge zombie fans so the awesome game was with them, and surprisingly it was the vanilla game. My gripes would be that the advanced scenarios can be awesome or very boring. The one where you look for fuel the entire time had my group bored to tears (though we were pretty tired) but the mansion scenario looks perfect. When summer comes around this should be in heavy rotation and I am excited. Theme is great, in most games we were got very nervous about the dice. Luck is a factor here but strategy can prevail. Very fun game.

Edit: Haven't played it in 7 months... I think that's a bad sign. Still fond of the game though! Need to consider if I am going to really give it the playtime I should.

As geeky icons (geekons?) go, zombies are definitely somewhere in my top five.  I love being able to play as either the humans or the zombies and the modular board and scenario-based rules make this game fun to play and different every time.  This one is always a favourite at gaming meetups.

RATING: 7
First impression (3 players): Thematic zombie-game where one player takes zombies and others control 4 humans trying to do a mission in zombie infestated little town. The game was better than I had thought as it wasn't too fluffy and actually base gameplay is very simple. There are quite powerful action cards for both humans and zombies that probably aren't all that balanced but here it doesn't matter that much as game is more about theme and having fun than serious gaming. Battles are fought with dice and for humans without weapons it is very hard to kill a zombie as you need to roll a higher pair (with 2 dice without bonuses) than zombie rolls with his 1 die. So having luck with dice helps too but my first character in first game died straight away after rolling 5-5 and 6-6... The pressure of zombies seems to be constantly (just) overwhelming (enough) which is a big part of game having just right tension.

Overall it is a good game, it might be slightly too long to be played too often for what it gives but if can be played in a right type of group it is a blast every now and then.

I wanted to own one true Ameritrash game and bought this one. The gameplay might suck a bit (roll and move for example) as I expected (it does in most Ameritrash games) but I do enjoy the theme and components. There is little room for strategies and tactics in this game as luck dominates pretty much everything. However, there are some issues you need to keep in mind when playing either heroes or zombies. After few plays the game seems to be easier for the zombie player but I do not mind that as it kind of suits the theme. All in all Last Night on Earth is not a great game but with the right group and after drinking few beers it can be fun.

RATING: 5.2
As far as zombie games go, it's one of the best.  That being said, this theme is still wide open and looking for its one true leader.  LNOE makes a valiant attempt to be that *one* definitive game, but sadly it falls short.

The "roll to move" mechanism is rather weak, as are the large spaces in the center board.  

All in all, if you like zombie games, you'll probably enjoy LNOE.  If you don't care for the theme very much, then don't purchase the game as there's plenty of sacrifices in the design in order to "make" it a zombie game.

I'm not really the target audience as I'm not a fan of zombies and I'm not a fan of cooperative games either, which this feels like. It's fun, but not as fun as a game like this should be. However, it is superior in every way to the god-awful Zombies!!!

The best zombie game I've played. I like zombie movies, but the games have always been snoozers. This one retains the B-movie thrill while still keeping players engaged. I think the art and humor on the cards helps out quite a bit.

Excellent, although the rulebook is chaotic and hard to use. I am happy to claim this as an intro-level CDG/wargame. Overflows with theme, and the rules are spot-on. Genuinely fun. Goes well with teenagers. Soundtrack CD makes a fine beer mat, and can be wiped clean.

Easily my favorite light, hour-ish thematic game. Players must develop and stick to an overarching strategy at the beginning of the game, or they will find that bad luck will dictate the rest of the session. For a game so dependent on dice rolls and card draws, it is amazing how many close games we have had over my 20-ish plays. It seems nearly every game ends on the very last turn or close to it. Highly recommended.

Well, this is a decent game, but it is definitely overrated.  If you play the basic game, it's too simple and gets boring fast.  If you play the advanced game, all of the complex event cards bog everything down and ruin the flow.  It's best to play the basic game but use the scenario cards to add variety to the mission objectives.  Any way, not a bad game... but hardly worthy of its undying praise.

Great campy theme. Best with 2 or 3 players. A wrote a review early on and put it here: http://chrisglein.blogspot.com/2008/01/last-night-on-earth.html

Today I'm just not as interested in playing it because:
1) The expansions seemed interesting but aren't terribly well balanced
2) If I'm going for a zombie game I'm going to choose Dead of Winter

That said, I have painted minis for this game, so it can look quite nice on the table.

A wonderfully enjoyable and easy to explain game.  For folks that like the horror genre this is a good game to introduce to non-gamers. It manages to create a lot of tension, a lot of player cooperation and interaction, has a relatively simple rule set, moves quickly, and yet there are always plenty of choices to be made about how best to proceed with each turn. We had a great time with this and so far all non or semi gamers we've introduced to it have liked it!

It is a fun game, for what it is.  It can be a cool experience.  However, it doesn't hit the table much with my group.  There seems to be a weird balance in this game, in that the scenarios seem to either favor the zombies or the humans.  When playing with competitve gamers, this can be a problem.  However, as a casual game that is played for the experience, it's not bad.  And it does have very nice components and a cool feel.

Traded it to a friend. Hope to play again.

I've had a number of games now varrying from two player games to 7 player games with the zombies fighting SIX hero's. In these games the "All Hallows Eve" setting was well unbalanced and the zombies got slaughtered. The second scenario we played with SIX hero's was "Burn 'em Out" which was a lot more balanced (person playing the zombies had six cards instead of four in both scenarios)

The perfect Zombie experience! Nice...roll-playing with the zombies! When I bring this game out, my first impression is how much it really seems like a great grade B horror movie! You can be the zombies or you can be a character or more trying to kill the zombies! Nice board, bits, etc. Very easy game to play, works well as a solo player game too! Once you have the rules down...the game play is actually seamlessly quick!

My wife and I now play a 2-player variant where we each take 2 heroes and we each take 7 zombies. She usually sends her zombies and zombie cards at my heroes and I send my zombie destruction on her heroes! When its the heroes turn we help each other! All zombie cards must be played if they can be played...there's no being gentle on those yummy heroes!

RATING: 6
Some games are only as good as the game group you play them with and LNOE is one of those. The rules are simple and the gameplay repetitive; the art-work is deliberately shonky and the theme hokey so you really need players to be chucking themselves into it - making the zombie noises, role-playing the heroes etc. otherwise it will be dull. Unfortunately I have yet to find a game group who have fallen for LNOE's dubious charms so it has always been just a bit rubbish.

I should say that the components are really good. Not so much the mini's which are of the the soft, rubbery variety but the board bits, tokens and cards are really thick and glossy and tactile. The drawn art is also really cool and the game looks awesome when all set up. 

In summary if you have the right sort of group this game would be a riot; although you could probably say the same about Monopoly.

Its a decent game with a fun zombie-survival atmosphere.  There seems to be way too much emphasis on random searching and hoping that you find what you need which I guess you can argue is fitting for the theme... but it doesn't involve a ton of strategy.  I like the live-person imagery.

Wow, what a difference from the boredom and rules tedium of our first play of Arkham horror. Now, THIS is what a horror game should be about: Easy to assimilate rules (at least in comparison to AH), no endless flow charts to follow (this really turned my wife off when we played AH), well defined theme that gets everyone involved, tension right to the end of the scenario, (something missing in AH even with variants) and even if the game is 2 hours, it's FUN. My wife immediately wanted to play again. The zombie and hero figures really add to the game. If these were just chits, it would not have been as much fun as we made up our own little stories and dialogue while fighting back and forth. 

Update: after dead of winter, this game is not needed.

Luck, as reported by others, figures very heavily into the game's outcome. Crafty play is limited to creatively using the cards you draw, but that's a very small part of the game overall. The soundtrack is... crap. Sorry. It's unlistenable, overly synthesized and bland. Just skip that part altogether and maybe play with some Akira Yamaoka playing instead. The theme is well realized, but this game feels like a slightly beefed up version of the Zombies!!! game that came out a few years ago. Overall, it's a fun time if you try to move quickly and remain focused. Otherwise, unmotivated players can get bogged down and lose interest.

Having played this game 4 times now, I can conclusively put this in the games I am not looking for opportunities to play.  After the last play, I decided that the game seems like it should be played as a cooperative game where all human players are on one side against the zombies.  Having a human player as the Zombie just gives them too much intelligence.  One time we played with 5 people, with 1 as zombie and 4 as humans, playing cooperative, and this was a miserable experience, as the zombie player was involved in all actions, where the 4 humans had very brief moments of engagement followed by long waits til their next turn.

RATING: 8
Muy buen juego. Las partidas son rápidas y divertidas, hay poco tiempo de espera entre jugadores y es altamente rejugable. Las cartas y los diferentes personajes dan mucha variedad y hacen que cada partida sea diferente, aunque se esté jugando el mismo escenario. El ambiente de peli de zombis de serie B está MUY logrado y la mecánica del juego es muy narrativa. A poco que se le eche imaginación, se producen situaciones muy cinemáticas, escenas que bien podrían formar parte de esas pelis. La calidad de los componentes es brutal. Las cartas están ilustradas con fotos de actores que representan personajes, zombis y los eventos que describe cada carta.

En este juego se pueden matar muchos zombis, pero no son para nada fáciles de matar sin las armas y el equipo adecuado... y uno corre el peligro de que le mate un zombi y pasar a formar parte de la horda como un zombi mucho más poderoso. 

La única pega (y por eso no le doy más nota) es que a veces una buena mano de cartas de salida condiciona mucho la partida y puede decantarla muy pronto hacia un bando. Pero esto no suele ocurrir y, si pasa, siempre se puede montar otra partida en poco tiempo.

Muy recomendable.

In my group, this is Left 4 Dead, the board game.  We enjoy it, and have played a couple of times.  Won't be as common as the shorter games I have, but it still has it's place.  With the advanced cards and the different scenarios, this is quite a replayable game, which is good.  We have found it a little unbalanced towards the zombies, though.  Especially if the zombie players are very aggressive.

After finally breaking into the other scenarios I recommend new players play only a bit of Die Zombies Die to get the mechanics down and then move on to the other scenarios. They are more fun and a zombie can be a zombie and the goals make more sense.

Huge zombie fan.  This one really does it.  Yeah, it feels cheesy, but it's supposed to.  I have yet to win as the zombies (i always play the zombies when i bring this game out).

Well written rules that are easy to reference.  Some scenarios depend heavily on specific characters (i.e. the scenario which requires the heroes to find the gas and keys for the truck, in this scenario the heroes seem doomed to fail unless Cartwright is in the group and can cycle through the hero deck).  The addition of free searches in the growing hunger expansion helped alleviate this.

Great game. Alot of fun with 2, 3 or 4.  Giving this a 9.

Prendi tutti i film di Romero e segnati temi, luoghi, personaggi e situazioni. La tranquilla provincia americana? C'è. La procace figlia del fattore, il prete, il vicesceriffo e il vagabondo? Ci sono. Case in cui barricarsi, o pickup da riempire di benzina per fuggire? Eccoli. Valanghe di zombi che escono da ogni dove? Quanti ne vuoi. Sono tutti in Last Night on Earth.
Il gioco è pesantemente calato nell'ambientazione, e tutto è in tema: l'eccezionale veste grafica (non disegni ma fotografie: i personaggi sono attori reali), gli scenari, le citazioni presenti sulle carte azione, i componenti (il counter dei turni per primo).
Le meccaniche sono semplicissime, il gioco è di breve durata e ti consente di concedere la rivincita nella stessa serata. E' inoltre corredato da segnalini "superflui", che permettono ai più volenterosi di creare (o scaricare, sia dal sito ufficiale che da mille siti apocrifi) mini-scenari una volta che quelli presenti, un po' pochini, sono stati affrontati fino alla nausea.
Sembra un commento da 8, vero? Purtroppo non basta il mio amore per il genere zombie e la bella confezione, il gioco è pessimo. Benché filologicamente giusto che ci sia uno sbilanciamento di forze a favore degli zombi (nei film vincono sempre), nel gioco questo ammazza la tensione: da una parte gli zombi che pescano e giocano carte azione in continuazione, dall'altra gli eroi che devono sputare sangue per avere anche solo un oggetto. Il giocatore-eroe gioca con frustrazione, impossibilitato dal troppo peso dell'alea su ogni aspetto del gioco a tentare una qualsiasi strategia; il giocatore-zombi non si diverte a sparare sulla croce rossa. Gli scenari sono molto impegnativi per i giocatori (la macchinosità del passaggio degli oggetti, fondamentale in molti scenari, rende tutto più difficile e segna l'esito della partita già dopo pochi turni) e, eccettuato forse lo scenario Defend the Manorhouse che lascia flebili speranze, quasi sempre letali.
Last night on Earth è uno dei giochi che ho atteso di più nel 2007, e allo stesso tempo una delle più grandi delusioni. Roba da rivalutare il semplice, spensierato e più bilanciato Zombies. Ma non è che gli zombi e i giochi da tavolo mal si sposano?

Fun. I played one game as a hero and one as the zombies and I won both games. Both were one turn games. If the other side would have had one more turn, the games would have gone the other way.

I prefer playing the zombies, because I like having my cards replenished every round without having to search. Appears to have loads of replay value with different boards, scenarios and characters.

Last Night on Earth by Flying Frog Productions is like a B-grade horror movie to its core. The characters are all modeled after real actors, and it even comes with its own soundtrack to set the mood. This game is teamwork heavy, splitting the players into two groups: the heroes, and the zombies. Like most other board games, this one has several expansion packs, and the modular board will allow you to play out almost any zombie cataclysm you could dream up.

A good, story-centric, combat-heavy game that plays very differently depending on whether you're on the zombie side or the hero side. Things are stacked pretty heavily against the heros, which I think is a plus for a game which aspires to being a zombie movie in a box. The components are good, especially the zombie figures and the rulebook, which is organized very well. My one complaint is that the introductory "basic game" features a lame scenario and omits a lot of "advanced" rules that aren't particularly advanced but do make things much more interesting.

It's actually been a great gateway game. Lots of people find the theme to be lots of fun, and this is one of the most requested games to play. Personally, I feel like I've played it a little too much, but it's been a fun, social game.

RATING: 4
This kind of game is fun to play on a turn-by-turn basis, but is so full of (1) die rolls and (2) card play that it requires a truckload of rules lawyering.  I also have the feeling (based on one play) that the system, built for countless (or at least dozens of) scenarios, isn't truly balanced for any of them.  

What I mean is that it feels like 80% of the time, the zombies have an easy (and inevitable) time of it, and 15% of the time the heroes have an easy (and inevitable) time of it, but you truly only have a knife-edge "who's going to win this game?" feeling 5% of the time (like "Betrayal at House on the Hill").  And games like this, though I want to enjoy them, always have me pretty worked up by the frustration of relying on constant dice rolls where you keep needing to beat the odds.

Ultimately, I just think there are better options out there for apocalyptic monster-fighting or zombie-fighting games (Arkham, Mall of Horror, Zombiecide, and even Betrayal would make my list before this one).

finally got this to the table.  enough rules holes to drive a mack truck through, but for all that, a very fun time.  it ain't no puerto rico, but with lots of friends over a few beers, it's well worth the time.  pretty sure my starting 8 will go down over time; maybe i'm just missing beer and pretzels games.  EDIT:  displaced by zombicide.

Best zombie game ever.  Oozing with theme, and high quality components, this game offers a quick and exciting game of survivor vs. zombie.  It's a roll to move, and roll to attack system, with a very smooth flow of game.  The characters and cards have very awesome and amusing photo artwork, and the gameplay is full of very hilarious and memorable moments.

RATING: 7.5
All components look good and are of great quality. Cards, die rolls, equipment and missions can make the game tilt one side or the other pretty fast - which accentuates the stress of survival during the entire play, nothing is certain until the end. This is both great and sometimes annoying depending which side you are on, but at least players rarely feel that they are playing a losing game for too long. A couple of lucky searches can have all heroes armed and strong in fights. A couple of unlucky rolls can break all weapons and get a hero killed quickly. Some missions are definitely intended to be more of a challenge for the heroes (Search missions require luck on the cards picked up and the mansion defense is a desperate situation that requires lots of luck to win). This is bar none the best zombie survival game out there. I will purchase an expansion or two.

My first real board game. For me it has a little bit of everything with lots of cards, theme, miniatures, artwork, random boards and reasonable amount of dice chucking. Survive until morning or complete certain tasks as the mastermind controlling the zombies or the fearless heroes. As the heroes work and adapt to what you can scrap from the buildings to complete your goal. As the zombie overrun the map and spread to trap the heroes who can move much faster than your mindless hordes.  

Painted all the figures in detail. 

Also have Custom Sun Track, Outdoor Events and Zombie Abilities Decks

Just bought this. Did a quick trial run to see if I had any questions regarding gameplay before trying to introduce it to my group. Seems decent, fast-paced, uncomplicated. Rating will change after first real play. Updated: Had two first plays of this yesterday; lots of impressions. Played Die Zombies Die! twice, both games won by zombie player. Human players found it difficult to acquire and keep weapons, also difficult to cope with zombie player's ability to continually refresh his hand. Both games were won when the zombie player killed 2 heroes.

I love the zombies! I think it's a real fun game,love the figures. The rules are not super hard,but in my situation im not a real experienced gamer and when I play im trying to show this game out to Non gamers and most people just kinda look like your cheating them when you pull out cards saying now there dead,dont get a wound,get extra dice etc.
I mean its pretty much all there in either the rule book or the cards,but just not as clear as I would like it. But I personaly like the game and love playing it. I would recommend painting the figures for some reason its just not as fun when all the zombies are just plain colors and the heros are hard to tell who's who.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Pretty uncomplicated mechanics with a lot of theme. That in itself is enough to make me love this game. It feels a bit unbalanced with respect to Zombies vs. Humans but that doesn't bother me TOO much and I hear they've fixed it a bit in expansions, etc.

I really want to like this game.  Excellent theme implementation, simple and intuitive rules, and an amazingly diverse experience in which no two plays will ever unfold the same.

That said, I have some concern that the game is too random.  If the dice and/or card draws don't go your way you can be totally screwed through no fault of your own.  It's frustrating to see a whole game go down the tubes because of a run of bad luck.

Still, fun and I'm interested in playing more before I make up my mind about this game.

Better in most ways than Zombies!!!
Better components, more interesting gameplay, more replayability (in base games) with the different scenarios, far fewer figures to manipulate each turn.

Good team game. A potential substitute for Betrayal at House on the Hill, given that game is OOP and expensive to acquire.

Can be played with 2 players, but one player must control multiple characters (along the lines of Fury of Dracula, but much easier) - a bit of a hastle if learning the game this way, but definitely doable (not too many cards and abilities to manage).

RATING: 7
Awesome theme.  The numerous scenarious keeps the game fresh and interesting.  The hero sculpts are done very well, and I love that they paid people to dress up just to have nice quality photos for the game box and cards.  It is really hard for the zombie players to win (and it always feels a bit like everyone loses when the heroes lose).  Definently worth picking up if you like zombie movies.  I haven't had the guts to try playing the cd it comes with yet (just a bit too cheesy).

Wow.  So incredibly well designed.  Ease and speed of play is stunning.  And it's just plain FUN!  Easily the best zombie game ever made.  A huge hit with my gaming group.

This is really more of a miniatures system than a board game. What you get with the game is very nice, though. You get a pretty board, pretty figures, and a cool CD with horror movie type music. The scenarios in the game are neat. If you like miniatures games and zombies, you'll probably like this game. If you're not a zombies fan, then this is pretty much like any minis game you've played before.

First play as a Zombie was pretty boring. The Heroes (experienced players) were way too strong and our Zombie's fell like flies. The least experienced players should be on the Heroes side, not the Zombie side. I had heard that the game loses it's replay value once a certain experience level is reached. It looks like this threshold has been reached with my group.

This game is Ameritrash in the truest sense of the word. A game where everything is settled by dice rolls, and is a streamlined in terms of rules but clunked up in terms of implementation version of most RPG combat mechanics. Unbearably boring, and with significant room for luck to make it often barely functional. You decision should not be limited to "Am I going to roll dice or draw a card, and hope for the best?".

EDIT: Played this many times with the right gruoup and the game turned out be the most balanced game I have come across since going back into boardgaming. Most games come down to the last turn(s) and it is always incredibly exciting. Especially considering this is a dicefest, that is an impressive deed. Love the theme and scenarios & flavour.

The upside:
- It offers a different experience when you're trying to get something from somewhere with your buddies and there's loads of zombies in the way.
- Modular board and different scenarios.

The downside:
- If you dont play it with that sorty-telling/zombie-movie ambiance it's going to be boring.
- Due to the lack of game, or the amount of dice thrown, it depends very much on the said ambiance.

This is the game that Zombietown should have been. The scenarios add enough variety. The players have interesting "powers".  The production quality is a 8/10, some more sturdy figures would have been the remedy to any shortcoming.  Rules are easy, cooperation and cutthroating are both in use, and play time is manageable.  Some players may like a stiffer challenge than this game offers.  Not all of the scenarios overwhelm the group of survivors.  It still offers tense enough challenges for my tastes.

This is the game that inadvertedly got me back into boardgaming ..The theme, game mechanics, not to mention the design job Flying Frog did on this game, I knew I had to play it.
Update...never really gets played, but then its competing with other stuff that I prefer to play. 
UPDATE#2
I really like this game. This game carries its theme very well,anybody with a passing knowledge of zombies and B movies will recognise the familiar tropes and archetypes involved, from the  very subtle too the downright obvious and the mechanics reflect the theme perfectly. It also plays very fast, although the optimum set-up would probably be with one zombie player. There isn't much downtime either, players can take there turns fast and if not playing there watching the zombies moving in. Large player groups seem to have the benefit of additional event cards which are powerful in knocking out the zombie cards.If you like AT games then this probably one of the best.
UPDATE#3 Im cooling down on this quite a bit and wondering if there are better zed games out there.Might end up on the trade list!

Superb production quality and with a kind of party game vibe thanks to its simplicity and treatment it gives to the zombie theme. Its good replayability (because of the scenarios) is somewhat diminished by the lack of strategic depth and the amount of luck involved.

I love this game!  The theme is strong in this one!  The cards are full of cliche'd characters and events.  When playing you basically write the script of your own B-movie zombie flick.

Fun zombie game. There's not quite enough zombies on the board tho. But I like the dice rules. Guns are unreliable in unlucky hands tho.

After playing many other zombie board games, this still remains my favorite, I love how stories develop when you play every game.

Love the B grade horror movie feel of this game. Gameplay is simple but the cards inject theme into every move. Tripping at the crucial moment as the zombies surround you. Discovering your back up plan (the back door) is locked. Hits the spot with my gaming group.

My rating of the game is biased, since in my only game I was a zombie player and had really no luck with the dice.

However, I had the impression that the game was rather dull. While the humans can at least equip themselves with funny items and have some decisions as where to go, the zombie players just spawn their zombies, move them towards the humans, play a card if possible (since holding on to your cards seems only a good decision in specific situations) and then just see what the dice rolls are.

I actually traded away Zombies!!! because I felt this game filled the niche of a 'zombie board game' so well. The base scenarios get stale after a while, but there are plenty of web base scenarios and expansions for this game. It is a solid zombie game base system. 

UPDATE: I've been playing this one a while. It's still fun, but I really need some expansion bits for it.

It's a neat flavorful game, but the mechanics are a bit off.  The zombies have a huge statistical dice advantage over the heroes, and are able to more effectively and more often use debuffs and penalty cards.  The searching instead of moving action makes thematic sense, but disallows the heroes from doing much of anything if they get a bad draw in the face of an advancing horde.  

I'd say a good fix would be a separate events deck for the heroes to draw from for free every turn, while still requiring them to search for items and weapons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have always found this game really fun to play. Very thematic overall and I really like the zombie theme. The mechanics are quite simple and the game is very random but I always have a great time playing Last Night on Earth. I think it also scales very well from 3-6 players, I haven't tried with just 2 players. Both human and zombie side have their own fun parts. It's always hard time for the humans but I guess that would the case in a such reality.

edit. Sold after 9 plays and playing each scenario at least once. Needs more scenarios and more stuff to keep going. There are expansions and online scenarios, so maybe you want get those if you really love the game. I don't think the expansions add that much new stuff to keep this going on and I got a bit bored with the simple and random system. Somewhat longish playing time compared to the weight, usually over 2 h or close to 2 h.

First couple of games we played of this were really funny.  The more we played it though the less I like it.  We typically play 3 or 4 player and at this point the game seems to be heavily stacked in favour of the zombie player.

Have traded my copy of this away.  There is no game here, just random dice rolls which inevitably lead to the death of the heroes.  The only challenge being will a dice roll kill you before you complete an objective.  Not so much of a game, rather than a randomised timer.  

Watched this on table top with Will Wheaton the other day and was reminded how badly the randomness of this game really is.

I have only ever played this game once, way back in 2011, and have virtually never enjoyed a game less. It just has almost everything that I hate in gaming, and I have yet to see a game from this publisher that had any good points. This one is woefully imbalanced, it's hard to see how the "heroes" could ever win. Oh, and I even dislike zombie themes...

And just to confirm that my tastes haven't changed enough since then to make me like this, I played the Timber Peak version in 2014, and enjoyed that no more. Still one of the worst games I have ever played.

(10/15/07) - Just got this game hoping for a good zombie game, since I love the Romero movies.

(10/19/07) - [8.5] - First playthrough tonight. I'll give it an 8 until I can get a few more games under my belt. First impressions are very good with this one though! Currently rated at 8.5

(12/14/07) - [6] - After a bunch of plays last weekend I am going to re-rate this to a 6. The dice rolling is a bit much and actual tactics are pretty non-existent. Lots of theme, not a lot of substance.

(4/3/08) - [3] - Further consideration has me lowering this score even more. I find that when I people ask to play it, I continually find reasons to avoid it. Not the hallmark of a good game.

(6/5/08) - [2.5] - Played again today, still hate it. This will now officially be put up for trade.

(8/12/08)  - TRADED AWAY, thank god.

Essentially they took the free print and play game: Zombie Plague, and added a boxed complete game with minor rules tweaks. So if you like Zombie Plague (And who doesn't really it's excellent) you can really just use this game with their better rules and have two games for the price of one!

RATING: 3
Theme is supposed to be this game's strong point but it does nothing for me and the gameplay didn't either. Have I "outgrown" zombies? I don't even remember if there was flavor text on the cards, but I feel like there wasn't. As a disclaimer, I only played the basic "kill fifteen zombies" scenario; there are other types of scenarios that don't revolve entirely around killing. I don't know if I want to play this again to find out if they're any good. EDITED - Played this again and I dropped the rating two points down to 3. Screw this.

I liked all Romero's films and I wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, the game mechanics did not work for me: Dice-rolling is too much and Zombies that can move through walls ??? It takes all the feeling of despair and claustrophobia away from the game adding to a lack of realism.
Otherwise, game components are impressive and I can understand the appeal of the game to many people.

RATING: 6
An ok Zombie experience, but it is not a stand out game.  I do agree that if the heroes hunker down and collect the correct cards they can rule the board.  It is well produced, but with many of the cards doing something different and the characters all having different abilities it can become confusing if you only play it once in a while.  This game makes me wonder if having a simple way to rate something for fun vs as a game.  I mean I liked Die Macher when we've played it and it is a much much better "game" than LNOE, but for "brain in neutral" "beer and pretzels" fun LNOE would be my choice.

Everyone has been raving about this one. We finally got a chance to play it. Music CD for the game? I hardly think so. I could have done a better job creating a CD for this game that would have enhanced the game alot more than silly songs that at no point had me believing I was being attacked by zombies. Sound effects would have been better than the crap CD. As for gameplay, I enjoy longer games. This ran a bit short. A zombie card that allows you discard 10 cards from the hero deck is just absurd. Overall, a good game but has many flaws.

It's an OK Zombie-themed game, but nothing spectacular. Decent mechanics if you like random dice rolls determining every result in your game. Oh, and don't forget the random card draws.

Nice social game for a larger group.  Not that many rules to remember to get started so easy to get to the table with new players.  Turn sequence is pretty simple, lots of nice components to play with, a nice variety of characters and scenarios.  But things aren't all that static as the cards in hand add a nice variety to the actions and mix things up a bit, especially as the best thing for the ZP is just to play the cards to keep churning the hand.   Finally, no need to start with the basic game at all - jump into the advanced rules and the scenarios and just have fun.

I had a good time playing this one. I'd like to try to play some of the other scenarios.

My only real complaint is that it takes a really long time to get to your next turn (often 15-20 minutes), and your turn takes like 1 minute at the most. It's even more disappointing if you don't get to do anything (or do much) because of the circumstances that your character is in.

Great variability and balanced play for the zombie and survivor characters.  On most missions the game comes down to a die roll on the last turn to determine who wins or loses.  The tension is hilarious and fun!  Rules are pretty easy to figure out and it has a great rulebook too.

Great game.  An excellent co-op.  The game seems unbalanced at first with the zombies having more power, but after a few plays the game is amazingly balanced.  No one side has more power and either can win.  Most game are very exciting and go to the very end to be decided.

I really enjoyed this game.  It is super simple, but very thematic.  I've never been a big fan of other zombie games and while I loved my initial plays of Betrayal, I got very tired of the complexity and the way the game never quite worked in the end.   This game includes scenarios that really apply that B-movie zombie flick feel and with the simplistic rules and witty card play, this really rounds out to be a fun 90 minutes.   I'm very impressed with the quality of the components and really enjoy the stylized photography.

[color=#CC0000]

    Update -- Please note that what is written below applies to the base game only.  I have no experience with the expansions which should add to the play experience.

    Players walked away from the board mid-game.  Vast degree of player disenfranchisement.

    Game sessions likely very lopsided in favor of one side or the other -- initial setup often predetermines the end result prior to turn one.  I appreciate this isn't billed as a stunner for deep play, but I'd like to have some level of say in the outcome.

    Some scenarios simply provide no options, turn after turn.  Players can get in situations where they are completely out of control of their character, there being exactly one obvious decision that often has no impact on the game turn after turn.  At times a fast-forward button would do this game a lot of good.  Standing in an empty building and using the "search" option turn after turn hoping for a character or a set of keys to turn up is just not sufficient to make people want to stay.

    No emotional investment in the character means roleplay aspect of the game is heavily hamstrung.  The characters can "find" things to defend themselves which in theory means an evolving character story, but they are generally lost or broken in short order so, again, there is no desire to emotionally invest in the state of the character as it changes.  You're as likely to be back to your starting condition at game end as you are anywhere else.

    Crowbars break in this game.  You ever try to break a crowbar?  For a game that depends on suspension of disbelief this kind of detail is very damaging.  Text and simple rule changes could close some pretty absurd conditions in the game.

    Any goal you achieve can be reversed at the turn of a card, and that can happen immediately after you've achieved the goal.  The opposing player may have the card in hand and be specifically waiting for you to achieve that goal so he can reverse it ON YOUR TURN.  Players get pissed off at that kind of thing.  We had two games (out of about five) where we simply stopped playing because the game had fallen into a degenerated state of play -- one side was totally dominating the other and there were simply no options to make a change.  You're not supposed to concede wins in multi-player games, but that proved useful for us.

    Movement rules can at best be described as "stunted."

    Combat rules a shade worse than the movement rules.  They're simple and that's nice, but simple needs to have some reasonable basis in reality.  I think it can be improved here.

    Designer goes on about play-testing it for eight years, but it is very apparent that games with similar mechanics and concepts never appeared on his table.  Vastly better games in this vein ([b]Buffy the Vampire Slayer[/b] comes to mind) make LNoE at best "obsolete" and likely make "broken" a far more sticky adjective.    I won't go that far, but I have absolutely no desire to return to this one.  There's a foundation here that can be made to work, but there are too many ways for the game to fall into a state where the game plays itself, leaving the players on the outside looking in.

    I very VERY much wanted to like this game, likely a factor in my level of disappointment.

There are two mechanics which absolutely blow this game for me:

* You spend your entire turn to draw a Hero card. Woo. Excitement. As much fun as skipping your turn or losing one. Except that, since many cards can be played on other Heroes, a strategy is for one player to run around the board, and the other players to play Hero cards to keep him alive.

On top of this, the buildings are barely thematic. You need to be in a building to draw a card, but which building doesn't matter. Yes, you can draw a specific object from a certain building, but only if it's in the discard pile. I'm not sure of the opportunity cost of running to another building for a specific object versus using this time to draw cards during your turns.

* Heroes roll two dice and pick the better of the two, but can't kill a zombie unless they roll doubles. Thematically, this is a perfect mechanic. The humans are quicker and more agile than zombies, but zombies are tough to kill. But, in gameplay, this becomes a tedious piece of accounting. Roll the dice, compare them, and do nothing. Fascinating!

I'll try out another zombie game before playing another game of LNoE, thanks.

Also: The mini's are notorious for being tacky when primed. Use either Super Clean (wear gloves) or Simple Green to remove the primer.

As far as Zombie games go this one is decent.  It has much better production values than other zombie games I've played.  The artwork is very cool.

Most games I've played have started out slow, but when they get going, they are fun. The endgame particularly feels very thematic, usually coming right down to the wire.

This is one of my favorite games. I wanted to buy this a bout a year before I actually purchased it. I bought a bunch of euro games instead during that time and kept putting off buying this. I wish I would have bought it sooner. This game made me realize that I enjoy games that give you a good experience and story to talk more than playing games that hurt my brain. It is amazing how different this game plays each time. The winner of this game is often determined by one die roll at the end of the game. In other words if you can't stand luck then don't play this game. If you like being able to tell an awesome story about how you managed to fight off five zombies and escape the town in a truck while barely scrapeing by, then you will love this game.

Our gaming group enjoy this one, as it hits that RPG-lite spot (although it isn't an RPG). We find the zombies are a bit over-powered, and the human characters often die and need replacing, which can be frustrating for the human players.

To say the central mechanic of this game is to move and shoot is to over simplify the game.  Last Night on Earth does an excellent job of portraying every zombie movie in a board game.  The players decide who will play the heroes and who will play the zombies.  Each scenario has its own win conditions.  At the start of the game the zombies clearly have the upper hand, as most heroes start the game unarmed and have a difficult time actually killing a zombie.

Players are deciding where to move, what to do, and how not to get killed.  Most scenarios have a clock, and will end in a given number of turns, meaning each turn the heroes are pressured to do something that will count, so cowering in the corner isn't the best option, but neither is facing a zombie horde with no weapons.  This game plays equally well as a lite role playing game or as a pure strategy game.

Aztan nekiestunk ujra egy ujabb (Born em Out) scenarioval es jobban atgondolt strategiaval. Hosszabb is lett a jatek es izgalmasabb is. A feladat az volt, hogy 3 zombi feszket kellett volna felrobbantani (nekunk kettoig sikerult eljutni) de sajnos a szabalyok pontatlan olvasata miatt megnehezitettuk a dolgunkat.

Set up the randomly generated town board, draw some random Hero characters and pick a Zombie player. Draw one of several scenarios and let the fun begin! This action game with RPG elements sees the Hero players frantically search through buildings to find weapons with which to defend themselves and scenario-specific items, whilst the Zombie player seeks to cut them off and take them down with special cards. The cards are all high quality and glossy, and feature real human actors. The game even includes a CD containing atmospheric music to really set the scene! The rules are very easy to master.

RATING: 8
The small town of Woodinvale has been beset by a horde of zombies! (If fourteen constitutes a horde.) People have called this game "cooperative," but it's also a team-based game: 1-2 zombie players (splitting 14 zombies) compete against 1-4 hero players (splitting 4 heroes). Hero players really must work together to win. Five scenarios are included, each one with different victory conditions, but in general the teams try to kill each other. Zombies draw up to four event cards per turn, whereas heroes have to struggle and search buildings to replenish their event cards, items, and weapons. New zombies may re/spawn each turn (spawns are most likely when the horde is smaller) but a zombie event card can cause surprises. The map is composed randomly using a center piece and four out of six corner pieces with buildings on them. There are eight heroes to choose four from (also random unless all players agree). Zombies are slow, but on the zombie turn they ALL move one space. Heroes move 1d6 squares or stay still and heal (for young heroes) or search (when in a building). Hero movement is always stopped by running into a zombie. Zombies may move freely unless they're next to a human, and then the smell of brains is just too strong for them. Hero weapons may help melee combat, or may be used to fire at a zombie at a distance. The game comes with a lot of dice but they're handled very well and lead to exciting streaks of luck. ("Why! Won't! You! Die!") The "advanced" rules have a mechanic for preventing player elimination which works really well, allowing them to take a new character and compensating the zombies with an uber undead called a zombie hero. Since all games are fought against a sun clock, games end in a timely manner. The whole game is very cinematic and tense. I like it a lot. 8.5.

UPDATE 28-Nov-2010: Dropping to an 8, where it may not stay. Obviously, my desperate love of all things zombie has colored my initial opinion here. There is a distinct lack of barricading and hiding as the undead break effortlessly through walls to find you. The outcome of the game is very dependent on the luck of the cards, and while this gives the heroes an appropriate level of desperation, it doesn't often feel that surviving these challenges is due to the diligence of the hero players. On the other hand, as the zombie player, you are offered a delicious array of horrors and disappointments to bring down upon the heroes while they blind draw card after card waiting for the scenario items to come up. Score could drop, we'll see, especially if I manage to get another (better) zombie game to the table.

This is the zombie game I was looking for when I bought Zombies years ago.  The modular maps and scenarios are superior in this game.  The mechanics are quick to grok and it can play very fast.

We prefer the game as a two-player one.  The game begs for expansion -- the ones we have do not disappoint.

Fun game of eating brains/running for your life. The zombie movie theme is as thick and repulsive as that gravy you get by mixing warm water on that gravy dog food. Anyway, win or lose it is a blast!

Update - this is still my most requested game and we are still having a good time. Most games have wild momentum shifts and come down to the very last turn for victory or defeat!

Too random, a few bad rolls can screw you, and too long.

RATING: 8.9
This game is enjoyable to say the very least. 

Production quality is god-like, I don't think I've seen another game that comes with MUSIC. WHAT!? Great detail and quality to the cards, and the dedication to actually cosplay for EVERY one!? Wow.

Game mechanics is pretty fresh and interesting, providing tactical depth, randomization and scenarios for gameplay variants, and nothing that seemed too strong or too weak.

The only reason it loses 1.1 points is because despite what I said, something about this game just isn't "jaw-breakingly fun." I don't feel invested in my victory other than hey, I want to win and make the other person lose. I don't feel attached to any of the characters, and it's essentially a "quick-match" arena style gameplay on videogames. Also, no zombie variants.

This review is based off of the core set.

This is one of my personal favorites whose theme and feel transcend what is happening on the board.  It captures the hokey, B-movie horror feel of the 80's horror flicks like Return of the Living Dead PERFECTLY.  There is nothing more gratifying than the zombie player dropping a card that makes a male and female character in the same space lose their turns ("This could be our last night on Earth!")
The game mechanics are cool and the different scenarios, expansions, etc keep the game fresh and exciting play after play.  I love it and wish I could play it more often than I do.

Owned it for a while, read the rules, and was decidedly unimpressed.  Never actually played it.  Here's my issue:

This seems targeted at a casual, buy-this-at-Barnes-and-Noble audience.  And it clearly sold well.  And yet the rules themselves are fiddly, the map looks like ass, and some of the mechanisms are terribly weak (searching for items).  Ultimately, this is just barely a step above Zombies!!!  Yes, with the right group, I'm, sure you could have fun with it.  But as a "gateway" zombie game, I don't think it works.

I bought this game at Gencon, after a demo at their booth.  Beautiful components including miniatures in 28mm (to match the current trend in miniatures games).  Three poses of zombies!  Nice cooperative play elements.  Excellent variety of games due to random and flavor-filled characters, modular maps, the Hero and Zombie cards, and the different scenarios.  Highly recommended.  This may become the best zombie game I own.

I liked the first game of this as it showed the game to be thematic and fun, problems showed in our second game. While that game had it's own user related problems (people wouldn't cooperate in a scenario that demanded good cooperation and planning), it was another thing tha tbugged me: I just can't get over the roll and move mechanic of the heroes in the game as it can make you half the turns not doing anything. Being stuck is ok in TotAN, not so here - how can I cooperate standing still?

This game seems to be the most fun when played with only 2 people.   When playing with more,  there's not a lot of interaction between teammates.  Usually just one teammate telling the other what they should do.  I would recommend saving this for 2 players!

How does 'photographic' art help achieve the horror of a zombie game? Sounds like someone in marketing's working real hard to make the cheap 'B-movie makeup/costumes with heavy photoshop filters applied' sounds like it might be better than what it actually looks like? Still, the game could be the best zombie game ever...?

Update: FUN FUN FUN! It is the best zombie game on the market right now. I played three straight games when I cracked open the game. easy to learn rules, good atmosphere, just the right level of player interaction. It does seem harder for the humans (but that's faithful to movies too). Don't care for the schlocky characters and photoshop art but it does work well as a package. Sheer silliness.

Can be played quickly (especially using the "Alone in the Dark" mini-game from [gameid=32248]), but really captures the feel of zombie movies.  The standard implements and cliches are introduced via the cards and nearly half the games I've played have become intense in the final rounds.  It's well balanced (especially with [gameid=32248]) and a lot of fun.  The soundtrack is not just a gimmick, it adds atmosphere and players have enjoyed listening while playing.

Игра на старых механиках, что совсем не делает её плохой.

Почти не напоминает A Touch of Evil. Немного напоминает Claustrophobia. В отличии от последней всё не так однообразно, по Сценариям нет вопросов, да и процесс игры за Зомби повеселей.

I've played this three times.  Based on mechanics alone, this maybe gets a 6, but add in the fun factor and I give it a 7.5 total.  If you have a sense of humor, you will laugh many times during the course of play.  Winning or losing doesn't much matter, just play this for the fun of the experience.  Also, the balance doesn't seem to be too bad, as 2 of the 3 games I've played have come down to the last turn.

"Killing zombies is not fun. Running away from zombies, is."

I also have mods for 5 or 6 players, or for a "Left for Dead" expansion. Message me if you are interested.

RATING: 6
Not too sure about this one after one play. The theme and components are awesome. But the gameplay was sort of weird and ultimately I felt resulted in the theme not being as exciting as it should have been. The zombies were surprisingly un-scary, and combat overall just... unsatisfying and not very suspenseful. In our scenario the main part of the gameplay basically came down to using pretty much your entire turn to Search (draw a card) and hope you find the keys. Then when we found them we basically won. Not sure how that changes in other scenarios or if it was due to inexperienced Zombie player or whatever. 

Also, seemed a little longer than I'd like it to be

Not passing real judgement on this game since I'm not sure how other scenarios play out, but those are my first impressions. I actually want to like it more, so I'd try it again.

I can't beleive this game is rated so high? We had to re-read the rules just to make sure we weren't missing something? I suppose adding in some of the other scenarios might make it more fun, but I doubt this one will make if off the shelf again to even try.

RATING: 7.5
Very thematic experience game.  Certainly the best runnin' around killing zombie games out there (I think Mall of Horror is a much better game but it isn't really about running around and killing zombies).  There seems to be enough variety in the scenarios that you could get quite a few healthy plays out of this before it gets old.

I wish that there was a bit more encouragement for movement and objectives, but I've only played the basic scenario.  It made more sense to stay in one spot and search the same place every turn and let the zombies come to me.  (of course, knowing that the zombie player should have never had them approach, but is that against the spirit of the game).

The one thing that I didn't like about the game was that certain items can only become available in their appropriate buildings after a random draw reveals them and they are discarded.  It seems to me that they should be available to be searched for at the beginning.

This is a much improved version of Frag, which may sound like damning praise, but certainly lets you know what you are in for.

All in all, good fun.

[rating lowered from 9.5 to 8] - Just to reflect the shiny & new effect.  Still a really fun game that I constantly want to play, but multiple 6-player games have demonstrated to me that the game can drag towards the end.I never expected to buy this game.  Zombies are not my thing.  However, I noticed a TON of LNOE pictures on BGG, and started looking through them.  "Hey, this looks like a lot of fun.", I thought.  For me, it all comes down to the approach.  The way that Flying Frog approaches the theme is exactly my style.  It's not serious and it's not silly.  It walks a narrow, campy line that allows for the evocation of equal amounts of horror and humor.  I don't think I've ever really seen a complete zombie movie, but this game is an exact representation of how I think it would be.  The characters are fantastic, and the card names and effects are just perfect.However, there are a few considerations:1) Quality of game materials can be spotty.  Everything is ultra glossy, which may or may not be to your liking.  Personal I *don't* like it, but the game is so good, it doesn't matter much to me.  Another guy in my game group thinks the materials are fantastic and of amazing quality.2) The CD Soundtrack is, unfortunately, a play-once-and-put-it-away sort of thing.  Most of the soundtrack to "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a FAR better choice if you want atmospheric music.3) The company seems committed to the game.  They have released an official scenario online and there is an expansion in the works.  They also appear to be extremely friendly and have a strong presence on BGG.4) The rulebook contains a hidden sentence near the copyright that says "The Martians are coming!".  There is speculation that this could mean the release of a re-themed Mars Attacks version of the game.  Sounds AWESOME to me.5) Dice play an important role in this game.  So far, my experience has been that the Heroes have almost NO CHANCE to win the game against the Zombies.  Other players experience just the opposite.  I can only take this to mean that the dice (and card draws) have a significant ability to determine the balance of power.  Is this bad?  No, not in a game like this.  It will play differently time and again.6) The Rulebook is very nicely done.  And the rules themselves are really great.  Just enough to get the game running nicely, with nothing overly complicated.  Even so, you *will* need to refer to a FAQ now and then because the rules, though clearly written, are susceptible to gamer over-analysis which could lead to confusion.

This game is tough to rate.  I'm torn between rating the game itself (mechanics, depth, complexity, etc) and simply rating how much fun I had.  The game is on the lighter side, yet I had a lot of fun while playing.  We had some good laughs. ( The names of some of the song tracks are hilarious and fit right into the events going on in the game.) At the same time, for me, the game was getting tense as it drew closer to a finish.

I'll play it safe and rate it right in the middle, a 7.  I'll have to give this a few more plays to see if has any table-staying power.

Amusing, and not entirely random. Typical Ameritrash in that most of the fun is in finding out what's on all the cards and so forth; actual play can be frustrating. I doubt replayability will be extremely high for this one, but it will be good for a while.

Me and my group of survivors are totally addicted to this game. If people tell you there is no strategy in this, don't believe them. If you don't have a plan, you will die. If the zombies don't have a plan, they'll die (a second time). Of course luck is an important factor as well, but in my eyes it only simulates real life (after a zombie apocalypse), the best plan can go terribly wrong. 

Buy this and you will play a movie. There will be triumph, there will tragedy, there will be lots of funny moments. Never split up, don't get emotionally attached to other survivors and always remember: This could be your last night on earth.

I'm giving this only 9 points because of the promblems some people had while painting these great sculpted miniatures.

Instant Top 5 game -- great mechanics, theme, art, scenarios -- we love you Flying Frog!  I have to think that at this point this is perhaps the one game in my collection that I will never part with.

Relatively easy going game, have now played with a few non gamer friends (with a pose to getting them involved further) and they all enjoyed it. Zombie theme always fun. A further expansion (GW) would be nice to beef up the zombies, who find it tough once the heroes are upgraded with XP from TP.
Perhaps rated a bit higher than it is initially when still new to the table top hobby, but is always fun to play as the tension builds towards the eventual winner.

RATING: 5
Classic AT game.  The theme is quite well done, and there is a degree of strategy in trying to corner the humans (or stay away from the zombies long enough to get well-armed), but certainly a fair amount of roll and move and player elimination.  Not a bad game, but nothing spectacular, in my opinion.

UPDATE: Dropping to a 5 as I can't see me usually willing to play this.

There's enough here to satisfy the hungry beer & pretzels gamer seeking a zombie game. I found that the entire game hinged around mining through the deck of cards for decent equipment. Have to give this more tries, but it's certainly miles above Zpocalypse.

Fun, cheesy zombie movie game with asymmetrical sides.  The scenarios are heavily weighted toward one side or the other and the actual mechanics aren't strategic so come for the thematic experience.

Certainly was better than what I was expecting.  Some of the rules weren't really intuitive (assuming I was taught correctly) and I died during the first zombie turn before I did anything.  It did get a little long in the tooth as it went on, but overall, it was a reasonable time.

1 play, 3er (me Zombies). 
A nice, light and fast cooperative game. Much better, even without all the !!!!!!s ! Hand management for the Zombie player, and some tactical play for the Humans. Seems pretty well balanced despite the multitude of cards and characters in the game. In my one game the humans ran off just in the nick of time (I think I would've killed the 3rd one off next turn). Would like to try the other scenarios, too. I'm not sure I need to own it, however: usually more into the longer games.

Drags out more that I prefer and, though I like zombie movies a lot, the theme just did not make it for me.

Four games now -- fun though very light, which is fine considering it's a tongue-in-cheek Zombie game!

I think if I want a bit more cutthroat gaming I'll stick with Mall of Horror, whereas a lighter night will call for LNOE.  Good stuff, though not quite a 7 because I really would have to be in the right mood.

This was the first modern, designer board game I bought many years ago until I got really into them at the beginning of 2012.  I went to a friend's zombie game party where we played this, zombie dice, and a few other games.  I liked it so much from our one play at the party I picked it up and quickly found out that the majority of my friends aren't into games like this so it collected dust until I got back into the hobby and found a small group of friends who were.

I haven't played it since but what I remember of it (in all fairness, I've only played the starter campaign where you need to kill a certain number of zombies before game end) is it is a lot more fun for the survivor players than the zombie players.  The odds are definitely stacked against the zombies so the survivors usually win and have such stringent rules that there's very little strategy or actually even playing of the game.  It's more like just managing the game for the survivor players.  I love the theme and playing as the survivors is more fun and interesting but somebody has to get the booby prize of playing the zombies.

RATING: 8
I love the theme. I love the tension. I love this game. Yes, there are some scenarios that are balanced more the favor of one side, but I think of it as a story. In Situation 'X', the zombies would probably win, so lets see how this plays out.
I love bringing this one out.
Unfortunately, its not the favorite game among my friends, and I find it hard to get people to give it a chance because I can't lie about how long it can be.

This game is a lot of fun even if you're not into zombies or horror movies.  It isn't a deep strategy game but does give the impression of acting out a B-grade movie.  Most of the games I've played have been very close, one side or the other winning at the last moment.

Even though it involves that much dice rolling (not a big dice fan) I really enjoy this. Naturally, I love the theme but additionally I like that you can play in "teams" against each other, one side Zombies, the other side heroes.
The rules were a bit confusing on some things, LNoE is a light, fun game but it took us a bit to get everything sorted out which is weird for a game that is fairly simple in its mechanics. Nevertheless, to me this is fun in a box. Thematic details where chance decides whether the heroes pitchfork breaks or the shot you fired hit the Zombie deadly round the movie-like experience, the soundtrack the game comes with is a neat bonus that I appreciate. We played with 4 (2 hero players, 2 Zombie players) which worked very well, need to see how other combinations play out.
If you want strategy, clearly look somewhere else, but if you want to fight or be a Zombie, look no further. Looking forward to trying more of the scenarios, great game for Halloween!
Now played two player (one zombie, one heroes) and had a lot of fun but some of the rules are just very confusing and we still wing a couple of things.

I don’t want to shock everyone here, but you might want to sit down…  I like Ameritrash.   What?  No shock?  Well, ok that was expected.  But you may be shocked to know that I was turned off by the over the top way that Flying Frog promoted this game, you see going into Gencon ’07 I had my eye on this.  So, I hunt down the Flying Frog booth and to my surprise, all the creators (and even Jenny!) were there dressed in character, looking back on it it sounds fun but at the time I thought it was a little too far, and in my mind it marginalized the game.  From then on I thought the game was all theme and no game.  All theatrics with no plot.  So here I sit with an admission.  I was wrong.  Maybe you should have been sitting for that revelation.

A great, light game.  High quality components, beautiful models and fun, fast game play. Absolutely dripping with theme, and I'm a sucker for zombie games.  Hands down the best zombie game Ive played, although I do like Zombie Plague, and Dead of Night looks like it could be a contender.  Its main pros for me are: quick game play, works beautifully with 2 players, great theme and the level of tension is just right for a friendly romp through the fields of the living dead.

What this game offer that the other Zombie games do not is a very cinematic experience that feels like a B-movie come to (board game) life.  To be fair, I have not played many of the different scenarios and I think some of them would be really great.

I also think that some of the expansions would add a lot to the game.  

I need to get this game back off the shelf again.

I also own the expansion:

If you want to be immersed in a B Movie Zombie flick, LNoE is a great choice. Tons of theme, and a great vehicle for laughing with friends as you blast zombies or swarm the heroes. But if theme is of no interest and you are only looking for a competitive game, stay far, far away, as you'll find this too long and too random.

RATING: 5
In a nutshell, this game seemed to me to be all about card play and not much about board gaming.  For the heroes, it was all about drawing the right cards at the right time, and for the zombies (who seem to have quite a challenge on their hands), it was all about trying to foil the heroes' plans by playing as many cards as possible.  For me, it certainly wasn't the most exciting experience around.  However, in its favour, I can say that it's not too difficult a game to learn and new gamers we have played it with have loved it.  And the production value is absolutely top-notch, with big, thick, cardboard components and very fun photographic artwork that really helps develop the individual characters.  The card text was a bit tiny for my aging eyes, but everything else looked great.  I also enjoyed the team play aspect of it, where 2 zombie players could team up against 4 human players.  But ultimately, for my zombie fix, I'll stick with the great "print and play" game, Zombie Plague.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 5/10

Crud.  I like it.  Highly random; not much deep strategy, but clever card plays can have dramatic (and often amusing/exciting) impact.  Lots of fun with the right sort of group.  Even one person who isn't 'into' the game can really drag down a session.  Also suffers from too much cooperation; its easy for more experienced players to wind up 'playing for' the inexperienced ones.  Not an uncommon problem with team games.  While it does tend to favor the heroes, we've had a pretty good mix of games going both ways, and its often exciting and tense down to the last turn.

Painted: all heroes, 0 zombies

This is really a great zombie game.  I've just never found people who really want to play it.

If you like zombies, this is a sure thing.  The game play is fun and fast and the game is easy to teach.  You can have new players up and running in no time.

The important thing to remember here is that this is a game where the experience matters far more than who wins or loses.  They call that "Ameritrash" around these parts.

********************EDIT 01/06/2011**********************

I finally got to play this game with a group of people who were all about having fun.  We had some great moments that I'll remember forever.  A total blast.  Sure, we got crushed as the heroes, but I think everyone had a great time.

I've upped my rating to 7/10.  It was at a 4 before, but I think I let bad experiences mar my rating.

Can be great fun, but make sure you do play the right scenario (Escape in the truck or Defend the Manor). 

The intro-level with base rules SUCKS for the Zombie player as it's not supposed to give them a chance. Why put this as intro level??? Is beyond me. You lose half the playing field by gamers not willing to put in a second go, guys!

[Update Essen 2013] Purchased Invasion from Outer Space to hopefully get some interest in this game going again. If that doesn't work, both will be traded/sold.

Clunky gameplay, boring goals (just 'search' over and over -- aka draw a card instead of moving, until you draw the cards you're looking for), uninteresting play as heroes and zombies both.

RATING: N/A
Played this twice so far. Pretty underwhelming both times. In fact, we got downright bored, which is unbelievable. But: I think it's because of two things. First, both times it was with new people, so the learning curve was in effect. Second, we played the basic "Die, Zombies, Die!" scenario, which is pretty boring itself. I think a couple more plays and a good scenario and this could be a lot of fun. It just got confusing, and nobody really knew what they were supposed to do. Furthermore, I think automating the zombies so that everyone can be heroes would make it more fun. Having to split the group up just wasn't really enjoyable.

This one can actually be kind of fun if the mood is right.  It's campy and there's a bunch of luck.  But when you have a game come down to the wire, it's quite a fun little time.  Also important, no matter what the outcome of the game.  You have a story to tell when it's over. 

Rating going up after a couple more plays get me thinking about the game more and more.  There is some wonkiness with the rules though.  Which prevents it from being great, but it's good fun nonetheless.

This is a fun coop game that is easy to teach, doesn't take more than about 1-1.5 hours and has gone over well with those I have introduced it too.  Chance can be a factor in this game, so play it more for the theme and enjoying others company than playing to win by strategy.

10/2/08 - downgraded from 9 to 7.  Although the game is enjoyable it gets pretty bogged down with rules exceptions that can sway the game to one side or the other.  Often we must stop the game to look up an official ruling on certain situations.

OMG, what a blast it is to play this game! Definitely needs to be played with 4 players with the "right" mindset. Yes, the odds are stacked against the heroes, and yes, it really does have simple mechanics, crazy unbalanced cards, etc., but the pure amount of fun that is derived from the dripping theme is fantastic! This is a game where the sound effects just ooze out from the excellently illustrated cards - in my two games, there was no shortage of "click-CLACK!" as someone cocks his shotgun, "Bzzz.. BZZZZZ!!!!" as someone mows down zombies with his chainsaw, and the ever popular, "We're so SCREWED, man!! WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!" :DDefinately two thumbs up for pure fun!

Played this for the first time tonight.  Rather enjoyed it actually, played the first scenario "Die zombies Die!" twice, the first time was a zombie win the second a hero win.  The game was laggy to start but really picked up once people got the basics down.  The mechanics work really well and I would have to say, I will NEVER touch any of my other zombie games again.  The production quality is top notch which is really nice to see from a new company.  The soundtrack is so not suitable for the game but you know, its free fluff which is always welcome.  I am very eager for the expansion.

If you are going to take this game seriously, you will be frustrated. There is luck in both die rolling and card drafting. However it has this great thematic feeling of a zombie movie and small town heroes. Great, I tell you! I just love the feeling in this game. So far I only own the base game, but even the heroes in it are straight out of a zombie movie.

You also have choices to make during the game. What cards to keep and play. Who will fight etc. So it isn't all just theme, you actually get to play.

Very fun, very well-thought-out take on the Zombie genre.  Nice variety of game types helps keep things fresh.

Some rules need a bit more fleshing out, but this may have been done already as I haven't checked since the game's release... too much AP in our first trials.

Theme. As with all Flying Frog games, you can expect a heavy dose of theme at the expense of game-play. You'll get a pile of cards, sculpted minis, and tokens. I actually don't mind this game. It's fun once in a while if I get myself into the correct mindset and take a very light attitude towards winning or losing. The different scenario options add a bit of variety. Overall, though, the choices you make on your turn are a bit samey or obvious.

Wow, is this game fun!  We had an absolute laughathon while playing Last Night On Earth.  The game feels very thematic.  The Heroes can run much faster than the Zombies, but the Zombies can crash through walls.  That makes it feel like the humans are running for their lives and yet the Zombies are always right there.  The gasoline explosions, saving townsfolk, racing away in a truck, the arsenal of weaponry, and so on all add to the wonderful fun of this game.

Last Night on Earth is probably one of the best dice-driven zombie-themed dungeon slogs.  It's drenched in theme with a variety of immersive missions and fantastic production values.

This game has all the tension, desperation, and cinematic moments you'd expect in a zombie apocalypse.

Ebben a játékban semmi nem működik. Túl hosszú az előkészület ahhoz, hogy megerősödjön a karaktered zombimészárláshoz (pl 10 körig bányászni egyhelyben a 17-ből... és ezen kívül SEMMIT nem csinálsz a köreidben), majd túl könnyen elveszted ezeket a fegyvereket (lelősz egy zombit és máris kifogyott a lőszer, a következőn eltört egyszerre a pajszer meg a baseball ütő). Nem tetszett hogy egy iskolás csaj ugyanolyan jól lő a revolverrel mint a sheriff. Egy helyben ácsorogva 4 játékos 10 körig ugyanabban a házban, ugyanazt a helyet kotorva talál minden szart, ez kivet a játékból. 2 házzal alrébbról fullra gyógyítani a zombi körében egy túlélőt megint mi már (varázslat?). Ha egyetlen overlord van túl erős, a találat vagy túlélő közelharc győzelem esetén újradobatás szintén, van összesen 1/3-ad esélyem lelőni a zombit, majd hogy kétszer egymás után megdobjam ezt az értéket 1/9-hez ami túl karcsú és rögtön veszítek abból a minimális életemből. Az hogy közelről leöljem a zombit közelít a lehetetlenhez (két kockából duplát ÉS nagyobbat mint amit ő dobott, 3 vagy 4 kockából is elég nehéz, ráadásul akkor több mint a fél játékot kotorászással töltöm). Közelharcban 10* legyőzhetem a zombit akkor se döglik meg, ő legyőz 2* és meg is haltam.

I did not enjoy this as much as I should have. Concerning repetetiveness this one is a strong contestant to any roll-and-move type of game except that it is a Move-and-roll-game (or Roll-Move-Roll-game for the hero player(s) ). Also, the rulebook could have gone further into detail on some topics. The CD has been thoroughly mentioned. It's a nice addition on top, but I wouldn't suggest listening to it while playing the game. It doesn't set the right mood. On the upside, you'll get a game with top-notch components and great artwork.

I love this game. I think it captures the zombie B-movie theme so well, while having mechanics that work. Even the randomness (of the die rolls, of the cards drawn) adds to the theme - because when you're in a zombie movie, you never know when you'll get a lucky break, or when the zombies are just round the corner, waiting to mob you. Contrary to most people's opinion (so it seems), I love the soundtrack. It's just so cheesily bad and really goes with the whole B-movie theme. I find myself humming it in work, which is always a bad sign.

I also like the fact that it lets me be really immature: the LNOE card gets lots of nudges and winks and quotes from the card ("Gimme some sugar, baby.") in a creepy voice; playing as the zombies affords the opportunity to make ridiculous groaning noises and yelling "NOM NOM NOM!" when a hero gets eaten; and, for some reason, the phrase "Small Town Lawman" gets lots of giggles. I also like shouting, "Take that, you zombie-bastard!" with unnecessary gusto when one of my heroes *finally* takes a zombie out. 

I really enjoy playing this game, especially with the player interaction. It's such a good laugh, whether sober or drunk!

We hammered it over the Christmas period (to the point of playing five games on Christmas Day), so I think we're going to ease off it for now, in case I end up with another Carcassonne-situation on my hands.

12/31/2010 - First-play impression: I wasn't quite ready for this one. I should have done a bit more research before taking it out and trying to teach it. Thus, our first play was a bit bogged down looking up rules, trying to read and discover why things seemed unbalanced, etc. We were making some critical mistakes until well into the game. Therefore, I can't judge this game by my first play. But I can judge the rulebook and say that's it's not that great.

7/10/2013 - Well 2.5 years later from my first note above, I've played it now with proper preparation and the right group. It was good fun. I'm bumping my rating up from a 6.5 to a solid 7. Who knows, maybe it will climb with even more plays. If the scenarios add replayability, that will definitely help. I'm pleased to have it.

RATING: 7
A good game with relatively simple rules and various scenarios that stop it from getting too stale.
Is still perfectly enjoyable even with the minimal number of players.
Different characters result in slightly varied playstyles, but doesn't break too far beyond basic rules.
Quite Replayable.

+ Great cheesy horror movie atmosphere, including an array of hilarious stereotypical characters.

+ I love the included soundtrack.

- Someone has to play the zombies.

- DICE DICE DICE roll to move, roll to attack, roll to decide if you keep your weapon, etc.


This game was fun to set up and barely a game when played. Sold it.

RATING: 5
Decent game, but slower than it should be. It's all about the cards, which is not a great thing. Combat is way too simplistic, and different scenarios are weighted very heavily on the side of either faction.

Really, once I played Zombicide I decided that there's not much reason to play this anymore.

Traded for Conquest of Planet Earth.

My husband received this from his Secret Santa 2007.  It's a beautiful game and we've only played a few times, with a few minor glitches.  I'm sure as we get used to the rules and mechanics, my rating will increase because (surprisingly) I really like this game!  Finally, have been playing it a lot and absolutely love it.  Have a group of 4 of us that play and it is lots of fun.

I've only played with the basic kill 15 zombies scenario, but it's a lot of fun.  Rules are fairly easy and not sure if I've ever played a game where everyone thinks 1 side is totally overpowered only to have the other side win in the end...except maybe Cosmic Encounter.

RATING: 6.5
This is probably the best zombie-themed dungeon crawl that you're going to find.  Of course, this means that it has pretty predictable gameplay and a lot of luck.  On the other hand, it has zombies!  And the rules are fairly well thought through for a dungeon crawl.  (For example, the fight mechanics lead to humans staving off the zombie most of the time, but it's very difficult to actually damage the zombies until you get weapons.)

Much like Betrayal, it can go really easy or impossible for the heroes. But when it works, it works like a champ and it undoubtedly captures the zombie-movie feel.

Funny theme with a soundtrack (which is sadly, not a great soundtrack, but kudos for the idea).  It's a decent game, but I have three complaints: (1) Playing with 4 players - too much wait time in between turns for the heroes (we split it 1 zombie and 3 heroes, because splitting zombies is boring), (2) Playing with 2 players - seemed glitchy, and (3) Not enough strategy, felt very luck-based.

What can i say i LOVE zombies! Think left 4 dead being played on a board game. It's a pretty good time frame (under 2 hours) however sometimes the game can be too quick and sway one way or another. I've seen the humans get swarmed in about 30 min. I have the expansions as well so i play it as one game not 3 seperate games but i have yet to touch upon even a fraction of the scenarios or even use any of the extras that come with the game to create your own game.

With so much i'll keep this game around to play for years. (although the luck factor is a little offsetting because it can really make the game a ride more than an experience)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Still trying to decide on my rating after a couple of plays.  It's probably between a 6 and a 7 at this point, which is disappointing as I was expecting more.  It is a good game as a whole, but is limited in a number of ways:  1) the zombie player is, well, a zombie.  Not many real decisions to be made playing that side;  2) there is a lot of text on the cards, which slows down what is best as a quick, theme-filled game;  3) some of the heroes (and some combinations of heroes) are much stronger than others; and 4) the ranged weapons (especially the shotgun) can make or break the game for the heroes as they are VERY powerful.  On the other hand, the game oozes theme and has a well-balanced hand-to-hand combat system that fits the theme well (zombies are reasonably easy to fend off but hard to kill without a weapon).  The randomness doesn't really bother me as it fits the theme and, anyway, the world would be a boring place if we only had perfect-information no-luck games to play.  Maybe some more plays, possibly with different number of players, will help me appreciate this more but based on the number of other games I'd rather play, I can't see this higher than a 6 or at best 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a bad hack n' slash zombie thriller. Even though it came to a close finish, I wasn't fully satisfied. I think I introduced it to the wrong group of people. Will try again with a different group at a later date.

*UPDATE* 

I introduced this game to my regular gaming group and they loved it. Each game comes down to the wire, and we have only used the basic scenario thus far. Some of the cards are horrible, but there is nothing so over the top that it breaks the game. LNoE is exactly what a zombie board game should look like.

RATING: 5.5
Playing 4 player, 2v2 with each survivor player controlling 2 characters was a bit awkward. Also, items are tricky to get and heroes start off way too weak. No doubt that is intentional, but it hurts the fun for new players.

RATING: 7
I'm going for a solid, solid 8 for this and if it weren't for my recent decision to remove half markers would add a .5 to it but it's not exactly a 9 so 8 it's gotta be.  Officially going to state the best zombie game I've played taking this coveted spot from Mall of Horror.  A smooth running system that is co-op between the teams.  Theme is very dramatically implemented and generates the "in a horror movie" feel very well.  

So is this game filled with luck? YES! Dice and cards come on people it's as simple as that.  Don't like luck you aren't going to like this but let's face some facts here.  If a Zombie plague were to set siege to your town wouldn't surviving it be luck filled too? How man whacks in the head would it take with a meat cleaver to actually damage the brain of your next door neighbor-turned-zombie-friend to best them?  Is that the same number of whacks it'd take to the cranium of big buff pool guy-turned-zombie in your back yard? One....twhoooooo...three...SPALT! The world may never know. 

This game is a lite fare and should be approached and appreciated for that.

Lemme get it out there....I love this game.

PROS: •Fun game, very thematic, unique, easy to learn. Movement system is cool, combat system as well; •The game unfolds itself without drifting away from the theme, even the cards have effects that thematically fit their titles; •Great artwork using photographs and filters;  •Gameplay is fine from 2 to several players, and the different characters and scenarios add great replay value to the game, intensified through the expansions. 

CONS: •The scenarios and player charts could be thinner and the miniatures could be made from a less limp material; •Some scenarios require a little bit of deck building beforehand, as some specific items must be dug from the deck and it can get really frustrating (the more cards you have, the worse it gets).

I may be alone in my opinion here, but I see this game as an exercise in futility. In two different scenarios on the human team, it was completely hopeless and I felt overpowered and at the mercy of the deck the entire time. Waiting for a single card in the entire deck can make this little more than Phase 10 with Zombies.

After three plays, with people who were not used to gaming, I was not impressed. I could have still played it but I gave it away to someone who could get more benefit from it (a member of staff at my FLGS).

Great game, the only gripe I have is that the center board is printed double sided (The Manor on one side, the field with the well on the other).  But the L shaped corner ones are only one sided, what a waist!  Why not print on both sides (like the center board) and give us some more options. Other then that, great game.  And that is saying a lot, because I'm not a fan of AT games.

RATING: 5.75
I love the different scenarios, and the distinct abilities that each character has. Intelligent opponents are always a good thing, but random movement is something with which I take issue, and should be dependent (fixed) on the character, rather than a roll of the die. When I criticize games like this, my friends are quick to point out BattleTech; while attacking in BattleTech is determined by dice, terrain modifiers, movement, and damage have fixed values.

Games that have strategic elements, but rely so heavily on dice completely defeat the purpose of planning. If I wanted that much chaos, I'd play Yahtzee.

Heroes are brain dead cause they don't really have choices to make, just run or explore, or react. Zombies conversely have so many decisions or options that get bogged down by intense thought.

Theme-driven good time.  Almost like a dungeoncrawler with zombies instead of orcs, goblins, and the other usual fantasy baddies.  The feel of a zombie movie comes across really well through both photography and graphic design.  The fact that the protagonists are so generic somehow heightens the experience, making the game even more about the zombies, and less about the heroes.  Several scenarios in the box, all of which are interesting.  For anybody who is scared away by luck, or doesn't play games for theme, do yourself a favor and stay away from this game.  The fortune of the heroes is extremely dependent on what they find in the deck, which means that there's lots of great suspense and a feeling of "Now can be when we turn it around!" but it also guarantees that the player who is winning for most of the game can suddenly find themself on the short side of the stick.

RATING: 7
A great game with a great theme.  My only real beefs being (1) the soft plastic used for the excellently detailed miniatures makes them slightly too "bendy", (2) the balance of the game rests just a wee bit too heavily on the luck of the draw which can sometimes be frustrating, and (3) the rulebook seems a little disorganized.  

Still, a really fun game with some awesome production quality.  I'm glad I bought it.

(March 2012 after one 3p game)  I am not a big Ameritrash/thematic gamer, but this one was pretty fun at times.  If you like Zombies/B movies, then this will be a huge hit.  I can see playing this once a year if in the right mod or with the right crowd or state of inebriation.  

A lot of dice rolling - we won our scenario with 2 players each controlling 2 characters in the "Die Zombie Die" scenario.

Rated so highly because I find it dripping with theme (literally) and because it has been such a tremendously successful way to introduce new folks to gaming. Seats a bunch of people, gets them to cooperate, and everybody can get into some zeds. Full of "flaws" for many experienced gamers, but I think they miss the point. For what it is, this thing is a blast. That said (as my collection shows) most Ameritrash doesn't quite work as well for me.

This is a quick fun zombie game that is fun even for people that don't like zombie movies.  Awesome game that takes about an hour or less.

RATING: N/A
survival horror board game that pits small-town Heroes head-to-head against a limitless horde of Zombies (players can play on the Hero team or as the Zombies). A modular board randomly determines the layout of the town at the start of each game and there are several different scenarios to play, adding lots of replayability. Fast Paced Game Play with Easy To Learn rules allows players to jump right into the action, while Strategic Depth and Strong Cooperative Play keeps the game interesting. To achieve a horror movie feel, all of the art for the game is photographic and the game comes with a CD Soundtrack of original music.Category: Horror, Fighting, Miniatures;  Mechanics: Co-operative Play, Hand Management, Dice Rolling, Variable Player Powers, Modular Board; expanded by: Growing Hunger, 'Stock Up' Supplement, Last Night on Earth Special Edition Soundtrack CD

RATING: 6
Blech.  Too much take that, too much randomness, too much chaos.  Give me a game that's all one of those things, in a short play time, and I'll be fine.  Give me another, where the luck of the card draw means that the zombie player wins on turn FOUR by killing two folks, and I'll happily pass to play something a little more controlled.  I imagine the game would improve with someone actually explaining the game before leaping headlong into over-eager slaughter of the humans, but only slightly.

UPDATE: The game DOES improve when someone is willing to explain the rules to you, and if you go into the game with the knowledge that this is an experience game with some strategy, tactics, and Take That!, then it much improves the game.  If nothing else, the game creates a great narrative, and leads to some session reports that are far too much fun to read.  I might even have to pick this one up at some point.

This game is boring. I like dice-rolling, but I hate how there's always one person who can never find a weapon and just has to sit there searching for the entire game. It obviously gets points for theme, but the gameplay and strategic decisions are dull most of the time.

Flying Frog Productions

RATING: 8
Great production value for a start-up game publisher, this game looks like it was put out by one of the big guys. The L-shaped tiles are a nice feature, allowing for a fair bit of board diversity from game to game and the miniatures are extremely well done. There are three different zombie sculpts and a unique, nicely detailed model for each hero. As an added bonus, everything is pre-punched so you can jump right into the action. The cards are fun, with super cheesy action shots featuring Man (or shotgun packing babe) vs. Zombie. Overall, it does a great job of setting the tone for an evening of zombie killing fun.

I'll admit that mechanically, it's not a game for everyone. Last Night on Earth can sometimes be a gigantic pile of randomness, and control freaks will want to pull their hair out. Many scenarios require the heroes to mill through their deck in search of key items to win the game. If those cards happen to be at the bottom of the deck, they lose. If they are at the top of the deck, they win. There is very little either side can do to affect the outcome when this occurs. Fortunately, this is fairly rare. When it does happen, the game is short enough to just have a laugh and play again. 

Combat is handled as it should be, zombies fall in droves to firearms, but become quite dangerous in close quarters. The system does a good job of representing the genre, giving the heroes every advantage in out-maneuvering and fending of the undead, but it does an equally good job of making a close encounter with a zombie swarm a very dangerous game.

My wife and I enjoy Last Night on Earth much more than the rest of our gaming group. We also own just about every zombie movie ever made, so clearly this game has more appeal for fans of the genre than it does for competitive gamers. It's random, dicey, and a touch simplistic. It's also the best Zombie game ever made, period. (Not that Zombie games are a big market share or anything...Basically, this game kicks the crap out of Zombies! and Zombietown.)

One of my all-time favorites...

RATING: 3
You've a map with 1" squares, characters with minimal, but nevertheless variable, abilities, special powers and equipment. Mix with undead. Skip RPG lite and play a RPG, or something squad level. Brutal zombie respawning methods nevertheless capture the cannot-win factor.

RATING: 6
There are a lot of good things happening here, but ultimately there's too much luck for the length and depth of the game. My first game literally came down to one final die roll, and to me, that wasn't an exciting high note to a hard-fought near draw; it made me forget about the three hours leading up to that and wonder why we didn't just roll at the beginning. I can definitely see why many people would enjoy this type of game, but it's not for me.

RATING: 6
I think LNoE works better, and is more well received when playing with predominantly non-gamers.  The theme is great, plenty of dice rolling, the excitement of zombie fights, etc.  As a "gamers game" I find it a little inconsistent, a little fiddly and somewhat more luck dependent than I would hope.  Also, the game really needs the person playing the zombies to act more like a "dungeon master" -- ensuring a fun game for the heroes, as opposed to simply crushing them.

Update 3/15/17: Lowering rating from 7 to 6.  I've probably played this 20+ times, almost always as the zombies.  I still like this game, definitely had fun with it, but it would take some prodding to get me to break this out.

RATING: 7
Fun zombie survival horror game. Can seriously get dice fucked but it seems like the dice provided are loaded, so replacements would seem necessary. In SirHandsome's words, a 'fun game to snack on'. In fact, I'd say LNoE is a much better game to snack on than Nexus Ops. However, it really helps to have an experienced zombie player or else the humans just have a boringly easy time.

Definitely would play again.

Update: Hmmm... it definitely requires an experienced zombie player or else the humans win pretty easily. Also heard the expansions make it way harder for the humans.

I have "New spawning pit" from the base game Zombie deck signed

Random Event Generators are about creating an interesting story, and the narrative in LNOE is weak to non-existent.

Plus, I've never made a meaningful choice in this game. Strategically and tactically, there's hardly a "game" here. Move toward the bad guy. Roll some dice. Flip a card. Get lucky, or not. Ugh.

believe the  hype , its good! Play is somewhat reminiscent of the (good) buffy game, co-operative and  easy to learn and play, excellent production values and piece quality, quick play time, very little down time, has a wonderful feel of impending doom with the sun down track (can you say GW's DungeonQuest?), the only reason I have not given  (what would be my 1st) perfect 10 is that after continued playing it may become stale, (although it certainly hasnt happened yet!) hopefully good support with expansions will assuage this. but it's a minor niggle against a very good game

I have to agree this is probably the best Zombie game to hit the market to date (2007).  The scenarios and gameplay is great.  Immersive theme, player(s) vs. player(s), and good balance make it a great game if you don't mind the luck of some dice rolling.  The only complaints I have are the cheesy dice (which I replaced with nice Chessex ones, and crap-for-made-in-China plastic cards (which is like trying to shuffle rigid Saran wrap).  The figures are very nice as are the boards and tokens.  I can even live with the photo-realistic cards are and the CD music which is at least original and won't offend.  My honest rating of this game is in the hight 8's to low 9's for fun factor, replay ability, and theme but my rating here is a 10 to counter act the few retards that have found their way to a keyboard and don't know the meaning of a "1" rating, especially when comparing this to other zombie games on the market today.  Hopefully FFG will do new scenarios and additional boards for this game.  A Shawn of the Dead scenario would be great.  If you're a zombies fan, the bottom line is get this game.  If you like cooperative games, this holds true also (though someone will need to play the zombies).

Wasn't really expecting to like this game when I saw the first "photo" art examples... but now all I can say is... "Wow!"  The game really captures the zombie movie feel and gives players a lot of cool components to create their own scenerios as well.

I don't usually play these type of games but as this genre goes it is a good game.  I would play again. Good theme and artwork. The odds are in favour of the zombies and but maybe not much fun if you are playing the zombies (they move towards closest hero and fight if in same square - therefore little control) - maybe the game should move them and the players should all be heros.

An inventive game with some great themed cards, although some rule-tweaking is often needed, e.g. when card descriptions are vague. Can get frustrating when weapons break so easily. Wish there were more scenarios, although perhaps we should try making our own with the supply of extra tokens and markers!

A dice-fest with a great theme.  If you want a co-op or team game, this is a nice choice.  The basic game is fairly straightforward, but still the FAQ is required because of the inexact rule wordings -- and it just gets more complex when playing the advanced game.  It's worth the effort.  Also worth the effort is playing the CD that comes with the game for added atmosphere, or better yet, buy a Midnight Syndicate CD for some real scary music - guaranteed to start the mood off right!

When you're in the mood to play a zombie movie, look no further. The fun of piling on zombie violence or mauling the undead with cool weapons is excellent.

This game is much better when it's several people against one zombie controller. It feels a little flat if you're only playing it two-player and the stock game doesn't come with enough scenarios in my opinion, but there's plenty of user-generated content to keep it a little more interesting. That being said, it's arguably the best zombie game out there and does a pretty good job of capturing that intense movie feel in the endgame.

Great game if you are into zombie movies, because it plays just like one.

For Trade: All pieces are in great condition, and none are missing. Replaced insert with a Plano box and everything fits perfectly. Some minor wear on top of box due to moving, but it's not dented or ripped and is still fully functional. Played only twice, I just don't have the playgroup for it.

I am much to square to appreciate the worldly nature of this game.  I thought a playful monster bash would be fun.  I was disappointed to find out that casual taking of the Lord's name in vain is frequent on the event cards as is B movie style pointless sex.  The sex is suggested, not overt.  "This could be our last night on earth!", Puhlease.  Either way, it is inappropriate and ruins the game for me.  My rating of 2 might seem harsh but is perfect given the BGG rating guide.  This is an extremely annoying game and I won't ever play it.

I don't get the number of rules questions asked, I always found this game easy to play. Some people, I guess, either can't or won't think for themselves. It does produce a somewhat more tactical rather than cinematic experience, but that's the nature of any game of this scale. Component quality is good, and there's plenty of variety in the scenarios & expansions (well, given the fact it's always going to be a zombie combat game...)

Rating tentative to more plays.  4p game, the rules aren't very clear on some things which was a bit annoying.  Will sort that out via bgg/faqs/etc.  Easy-going for the most part, first few turns in burn em out scenario was slightly uninteresting.  With more plays w/same people it'll meta a bit I'm sure.

Most of the plays have been with people new to the game, and it has never gone over as well as I'd hoped. I personally enjoy it, but it feels like you need 5 people who are into it or are at least decent gamers to get a good game.

Plays well with 2, but lacks the team element. Plays pretty well with 3 too, not too much hero management on that side.

Sold.

Very fun game.  Almost a 8 except that there are some circumstances I would turn down a game but those are few.  Not good for every crowd considering the theme.  It is highly enjoyable playing either the zombies or the heroes.  Up until the end, it feels like both positions are equally hopeful/hopeless.  (depending)  It also gives a nice feel of pressure building like in a zombie movie.  All around great experience.

Thematic zombie fight. However being the zombies feels like any card you draw is too late or too early and ultimately useless, as the survivors you're just endlessly drawing cards from a deck hoping for something good. all in all the scenarios are all very similar and most games play out the same way.

Perfect game in my opinion!  Great with large groups!  Always intense.  Perfect theme!  I've played this well over 200 times and there is plenty of strategy involved. In fact, I would say it has more strategy than many of the top games where your toughest choice is, "Should I take wood or stone" (games I definitely enjoy mind you).  Of course people who don't like any luck with immediately mock this rating.  They are forgetting that games are for fun and sometimes you want things to be a little random...dice aren't evil and neither are card draws.  You can control quite a bit in this game, but not everything and that's part of what makes this game a blast to play.  There are many different scenarios to play and lots of expansions which give a TON of replayability. The best thing about this game is that it is like a tool box for games.  You are given extra pieces to create your own games and scenarios...which I have done. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves theme and exciting/tense dice battles. The only downside is the rule book isn't written very well.  Be patient with that!

This is a Beer Drinking game. (I hate Pretzels.)

a nice entry in the horror, rpg boardgame genre.  i like the atmosphere, and having multiple zombie players is decent.  the artwork is great, and the decks seem balanced.  i would like more town boards, and scenarios, but that will come with time i guess.  luck can hit you rather hard here, so be prepared.

RATING: 8
Combining the best elements of several other zombies games, this one finally gets the undead theme right. Part quality is beyond belief (boards are a little cheap though). Expect LOTS of card playing. Seriously, this is not one of those games where players hold on to important cards until they are absolutly needed. Nope, chances are that zombie player is going to start zonking you with all sorts of cards the very first time you dare wander into a zombie space. Killing zombies is actually kind of difficult (you have to roll doubles) but keep in mind that's without weapons, and as long as you roll higher than the zombie you manage to push them off of you. Some may be dissapointed that the zombies can walk through wall, but I think games would get kind of stale if they couldn't. The rules themselves are fine, but the sheer number of cards in the game twist things up just enough to require a 30-some page FAQ sheet. Sigh. Kind of a drag, but this is still a real surprise. I'm not really sure the human player can EVER win some of the scenarios.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game, simple and straight forward mechanics. The scenario greatly impacts gameplay -- dictating whether you simply react to the luck of the draw for your cards, or if you can set a strategy and work toward a goal. Still, does a good job of fitting the theme, and stellar components. A nice, fun zombie romp.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played through most of the scenarios.  Some are harder for one side than the other, and strategy is a must if you want a shot at winning from the more difficult side.  
Pros:
This game is very teachable, even to non-gamers.  The music is very appropriate and a great alternative to the hum of soda machines.  All of the scenarios (that I've played) are great fun, especially with a group that likes theme.  The pieces are great, even if you have to peel the cards off of each other when you first get the game.  Just long enough to build and create a great amount of tension. FFP seems very eager to offer new scenarios online!
Cons: 
Some of the zombie cards do little to nothing (adding "Strange" as descriptor, discarding 10 cards, being unable to trade) and seem to be more appropriate for a slightly different set of cards.  The heroes seem to be more prone to getting screwed by the dice than the zombies (but it's so hard to screw them such that they can't get back from it).

Last Night on Earth emulates zombie B-movies extremely well. The theme is thick in this one, and I enjoy the hell out of playing out a low budget zombie films with my friends, but I realize that it's not for everyone. For such a light, and luck-based game, it is thick on rules, there is so much chrome, and extras that a well organized rules summary is a must (luckily I've created just such a document myself).

It is also for mature audiences, but that is a must to fit the theme in my opinion.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Humorous and thematic.  It's not the slice and dice fest one would expect, but rather a search and avoid scenario, since you cannot kill the zombies without having a weapon first, you can only fend them off so it's useless to engage them.  I can see how the game would be boring if it's a landslide win for either side, as such the experience is largely determined by how the card draws turn out.  Certainly a good effort in the semi-cooperative genre and probably a must have for fans of survival horror.  I could see myself playing this once in a while.

This is my favorite zombie game ever!  

I really like the production value of this game.  A lot of planning went into this release and it shows!

Flying Frog Productions has one of the best customer service departments I have ever had to use.  Although it mainly consists of MaryBeth, they are on the right track of becoming one of the best game producers out there!

The game play for LNoE is outstanding on all accounts!  Not only is it a blast to play as either the zombies or heroes, but so much is going on here!  

The theme is implemented in everything and I think that is fantastic!  Anywhere from game events to strategy, I actually feel as though I am in a B horror movie during play.

The cards are great!  Some pretty excellent resources are available to heroes and very much play into the theme flawlessly.  Heroes find items that one would expect when trying to avoid a horde of brain-seeking mutants!

The game board is very unique in that it is consists of L-shaped mini boards to create a larger playing surface.  An addition of more playing boards will be  included in the Growing Hunger expansion and I hope to see a variety more in upcoming releases!

The game components are next to perfect.  Many complain that the cards are too thick and stick together, but I honestly like them a lot and haven't run into too many problems.  The artwork is excellent... what a unique way to depict items and game events through the actual use of actors!  

The miniatures are some of the best in comparison to every game I own and love!  Not only are they easily some of the most intricately detailed that exist, but they very much look exactly like the actual characters depicted on the Hero sheets!

The chits are top-notch as well. The glossy finish has to be the nicest touch of all, in my opinion.  This makes for a very durable game and one which will last many years to come!

I cannot be happier.  No other zombie-themed game comes remotely close to this!  This has to be the best available!

Contrary to popular belief, this is not the best zombie game ever, not by a long shot. It may be the best zombie game 'released' but, come on, the competition isn't exactly challenging now is it?!

LNoE is an overrated popular mass market offering. [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/27736]DEAD OF NIGHT[/url] and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/7514]ZOMBIE PLAGUE[/url], which are both games done by enthusiasts, and are both free PDF downloads, knock the living shit out of this steaming turd.

 LNoE attempts to utilise the best ideas from both of these games yet only manages to break them in the process!

[b]A constantly growing Forum of Rule Queries (over 1000 questions), presents an excellent example of the never ending loopholes you will find in this 'sandbox'.[/b]

IMHO the Fan Boys are just blinded by the overproduction. Gloss & sculpts do not make for a good game, and the photo-shopped semi-realistic artwork with camp, unconvincing, cheesy, piss poor actor posing in mock horror is not my cup of char either I tell thee.

LNoE totally misses the thematic mark. Presenting us with some pathetically bad B-Movie attempt, Instead of trying to recreate the classic zombie films by George A. Romero & Lucio Fulci. It's as if the designers have never even seen a zombie film, and are making their own assumptions as to what possibly happens in these films.

The ruling for zombies ghost walking effortlessly through walls, and heroes being able to fire through walls is a terrible idea which totally removes any feeling of realism, tension, or claustrophobia from the game. They should have stuck to doors only, and placed an odd window in here & there.

The lame scenarios fail miserably at trying to portray any of the defensive/survival situations that crop up in the vast majority of zombie movies.

The roll and move mechanic also leaves something to be desired. Zombies can catch up with healthy humans due to dumb dice chucking.

Then there's the RANDOMNESS... [i][b]"OMFG is this random!!!!!"[/b][/i] Strategy, skill & tactics do not feature in this game [u]at all[/u], as every single decision relies purely on luck. Virtually no choices in the game are left to the player alone without massive turn altering factors from die rolling, and card playing galore being slapped on top of every situation, altering every possible outcome.

The music CD is a wasted opportunity. A pointless inclusion, which is entirely unsuitable for an accompanying 'so called horror' soundtrack. Featuring ill suited, up tempo Midi sounds which lack in any atmosphere, and fail miserably at adding any spice to the lame offering.

I find it incredibly irritating that the uneducated Fan Boys will tirelessly defend what is nothing but a [b]Card & Dice fest'[/b]. These folk have obviously only ever watched one slapstick zombie comedy movie, and on that basis constantly refer to zombies only eating Brains!

Survive against the attacks of the Zombies and fulfill the objectif in a scenario. Slasher game with a special cinematic moments and artwork. Rules are simple but effective. The game uses photographs of actors to depict on the cards. Zombie killing fun. 

Beware this game has very annoying skip a turn etc take that cards which are totally frustrating. But on the other hand the game provided us already with a ton of hilarious moments too. So if you search for zombiegame that gives you a story to tell after you played it, this is the zombiegame to recommend.

A more conventional game than Mall of Horror, but just as enjoyable from my perspective.  Beautiful components (the the box insert could be better), and a really class game.  It is possible to get screwed over by randomness, which stops this from being a classic, but ultimately, it's an amazingly fun, B-movie-esque romp through Zombie territory.  Very good.

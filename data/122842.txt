GAME: Exodus: Proxima Centauri
RANK: 958
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
Juego tipo 3X espacial con hexágonos (4X sin exploración) de mecánicas sencillas estilo americano (dados de ataque, elección simultánea de acciones y de movimiento), que simplifica la base de juegos de la temática como twilight imperium en un juego jugable en 3-4 horas. Árbol de tecnologías directo y sencillo. Comercio sólo con la banca. Las naves de plástico son de lo mejor, y el tema de lanzarse misiles de 3 tipos entre los planetas es quizás de lo que más atrae, original y diferente. En general un juego muy directo, ameritrash puro con toques de gestión, que desde fuera parece mucho más complicado de lo que realmente es. 
El manual esta bastante bien explicado, si bien se dejan algún detalle que mencionar, que tienes que ir a las faqs. Lo mejor su inmensa cantidad de setups de mapa y variantes diferentes para diferente número de jugadores. Expansión aporta alguna cosilla, faltaría revisar mejor.

This game is somewhere between Eclipse and TI3. It is not that much of micromanagement as Eclipse, and hardly as combat/action driven as TI3. This fact makes it a perfect 4x space exploration game, fit for newbies and for players who do not have the time to immerse in TI3's universe for example. The gameplay is nice, combining a bit of diplomacy, resource management, combat and tech advancement.

Well, first of all it is important to say I played only the first 5 rounds and with the battles rules wrong. I believe this didn't alter the perception I had of this game overall, though.

I enjoy the theme a lot, so I tend to give good ratings for games that explore well the theme of space opera.

It is a game that I can compare with 2 oher games: Eclipse and Twilight Imperium.

I prefer Exodus from Twilight Imperium because of the downtime that is minimum in Exodus and the playtime is short, too. But TI has a better gear in what complains of Tech Tree and different races with different powers. But with the political phase and actions and reactions system, I liked the way Exodus handle things and it is very enjoyable. Other thing I enjoy better on TI is the tech tree that makes impossible to invest in very advanced technology early in the game. Other thing that is the same is that the galaxy is all known, it makes the exploration more predictable and strategic to players since they know were they want to go.

Now comparing to Eclipse. Exodus uses some ideas from Eclipse such as fixed rounds instead of race system, like TI, ship blueprints and other small stuff. Eclipse is a simpler and faster game because it lacks of any political phase with galactic votes. It is because the premisse in Eclipse is that nobody know each other to have a law valid to every player, instead of political phases, Eclipse introduces a diplomacy that works fine in a very simple way. Anyway, I enjoy the political phase more in Exodus than the lack of it on Eclipse. The blueprint is valid in both games but I tend to prefer the Eclipse system better, because you can manipulate not just the amount of dices to roll (number of cannons) and hit points to destroy (hull in Eclipse, shield in Exodus), but the number necessary to hit (computer and shield in Eclipse) and the amount of damage a hit does(different kind of cannons in Eclipse), this one affect the combat aspect and, justice be told, I didn't play the combat with right rules in Exodus to compare proper.

Other thing that is an aspect present just in Eclipse and absent in any ways from Exodus or TI is that if you expand your empire, ok, you tend to collect more resources, but the cost of mantaining the empire rises, so the richer not always get richer. Other aspect that I get mixed feelings is that Eclipse has an explore feeling as the galaxy is not fully explored from the start, it is mixed because I like the exploration feeling from Eclipse and it makes sense to get into a hex without so much resources or with surprises, but in other hands knowing were to go from the start is more strategic. In the end I like the tech system from Exodus since it is all open for you since the start, in Eclipse there can be problems that force players to discover different technologies because of the luck, rather than letting them choose the path they want to choose. But in this aspect TI is the best since it has technology that is dependent on other tech to be discovered and I enjoy this feeling more than in the other games. And one of the best aspects from Eclipse and TI is that everyone has different abilities with different races.

Overall Exodus is a really decent game, that explore well the potitics, resource manegement and combat on space. And the playtime is in the range from Eclipse to TI.

RATING: 5
Another epic space game that is fiddly with weak components. The actual gameplay encourages warfare in order to get VPs. It does play fairly quickly once all the icons are understood. 

Nothing too exciting. Instead of cubes, cylinders are used. Game play wise do not bring any sense of entertainment or fulfillment, just plain flat. 

A slight waste. But no loss, as there were no expectation from this game.

RATING: 6
The score of 6 is probably less than this game deserves. The feel of the pieces and components are of excellent quality and has lots of quality of life improvements over other 4X-like space games. I especially love how the board can be set up. The pieces, other than the uninspired stock ship models, are nice enough to make me want to play by themselves and, oh boy are there a ton of dice. Buckets of dice.

This game is similar to others in the genre but with more politics and less resource management. The mechanics tend to take a backseat as the entire game is almost perfectly symmetrical, including the randomized planet tiles. Unfortunately, this is a huge negative that kills replayability until you have people trying different politics every time. With battles being almost entirely random and the main way to score, it drags the game down as a pointless feeling time waster. Spicing up that combat system to be as interesting as the ship bulding alone would keep my interest for longer. In addition, adding other scoring methods. As it stands, technologies, card actions and combat are rather straightforward and don't require any real thought.

The main gameplay comes down to the voting and auction systems. If you can do basic math, the resource management will become second nature and all players will be on the same level. Meaning points will come down to A. Pure chance on dice rolls in combat and B. How many positive/negative laws you're affected by.

With some houserules to expand scoring, Exodus can easily become a game night favorite.

Eclipse gave the 4x genre a slick, smooth euro makeover.  Exodus grabs the genre back and re-introduces the fiddle factor, whether it is with the simultaneous movement tokens or the plain fiddly resource pieces.   In terms of how you win, Exodus feels old school too.  There is a tech tree, but there are no points to be had for developing technologies. They're just a means to the end of grabbing territory and shooting up opponents' ships. To facilitate that fighting, the universe is smaller than in Eclipse and there is nowhere to go off and explore.  There is a political subsystem, but it has no more impact on the game than the laws in Cuba, so needn't detain us.

One thing Exodus does just like Eclipse - and you'll wish it hadn't - is put over-mighty weapons in our hands.  In this case it's the nukes that can destroy  entire planets.  Who could resist laying half the play area to space dust?

One area where Eclipse disappoints is in its ugly space ship miniatures (and the lack of any for the space stations). Those in Exodus maintain the standard of ugliness.  Indeed, the artwork as a whole is pretty uninspired, though generally functional.

I don't like much this kind of games. Compared to Eclipse this game has almost nothing better to offer.

The only thing I liked a lot is that the players have more freedom to choose among many technologies from the beginning of the game!

RATING: 7
It's really good. I won't pick it up as I already have TI3, Eclipse, Starcraft and several other games that scratch a similar itch (and it's also in our gaming group already). That said, it's a good game. There are some issues: although I like the idea of simultaneous movement and revealing, in practice it feels tremendously clunky. However, the game is good. Definitely give it a try and don't write it off for seeming like TI3-lite or a different Eclipse. It's a game that reuses a lot of mechanics but comes together very nicely. I personally don't like the rulebook and I think the graphic design is nicer in TI3 or Eclipse. But still: play it; it's good.

Played 3 times now and enjoyed it each time, all the actions seems to be choosing from 'good' choices rather than 'bad' ones and the game seems to flow smoothly, would be nice to have some kind of inter player trade, rockets seem a little nasty during the game but have little effect on the final scoring

First ed. with the upgrade kit: unfortunately the upgrade kit was not substituting all components which is a shame considering the price (centurion cards not replaced->old symbols that do not exist in the revised version, revised rulebook not provided etc).overall stepup in terms of components quality at least.

Gamewise, relatively straightforward, no exploring needed which leads to smaller playtime, everybody is on each other's face pretty fast, so not for the Eclipse fans that liked staying in their little corner and harvest planets. Overall a pleasant game without going the extra mile to establish itself as the space game of my collection.

 A very solid game, under-rated because of the horrible 1st printing issues of the title. The rating took a bashing because of it. I own second edition, and the game feels very fluid, streamlined. I don't use movement tokens, I write movement on paper, it is faster that way.

I have played this game twice. I was planning to sell this game away, since I haven't played it 2 months after buying. I decided to trade it for Eclipse (my current favorite game, wich I don't own). I decided to give it a good farewell, and play it 2p with my girlfriend. We had a wonderfull, very tense, session. My girlfriend forbade me to exchange it after the play. And she hates confrontation ( I mean... yeah, she's a girl). I still love Eclipse, but this game is faster and better as 2p. I might not buy Eclipse at all and still be fine. With more games, the rating might go up.

The gameplay is really great. I love the voting system and the combat is really straight foward. However the components just drag the whole thing down. Having dice to indicate planet's resources and markers to distinguish the second ship ,in my opinion, are not good ideas. Ship movement markers are really a pain in the a** . Luckily, they have a companion app to make things easier but still it doesn't help much. I hope they could fix it in the next edition.

Excellent alternative to other 4X games!

I bit more going on, and it adds to the game time, but after a couple of plays, and resolving appropriate phases simultaneously, should result in play time becoming reasonable.

Beware the components...I received incorrect pieces and was missing pieces...hopefully correcting the problem will not become a hassle.  (although it appears the NSKN customer service is regarded on BGG as being very good)

A bit too fiddly for my taste, the movement selection tokens seemed excessive.  The comparison to Eclipse or Twilight Imperium is inevitable and it falls short in my opinion.  Still a decent game, but not my favorite in genre by any means. The tiny round cylinders would have been much better as hexagonal prisms or something else that didn't roll around.

Surprisingly excellent game! Space battles are usually not my thing, but this one has very clean, intuitive mechanics without all of the bloat that usually comes with these 4x games. 

The techs are all crazy good, which makes this game so fun to play: whatever route you take, you will be happy with the results. The incredibly overpowered rocket techs might be game breaking in a 2-player game, but they are hilariously vicious. 

I still prefer the Euro mechanics of Eclipse to this game, but I'd say Exodus: PC is far superior to TI3 or Empires of the Void. After Praetor and now this, I'm beginning to think Andrei Novac is a designer to watch. Very excited about Versailles!

This game is fantastic.  I prefer this to Space Empires, Twilight Imperium, and Eclipse.  It plays fast and has a huge amount of variety to play.  Focus is less on diplomacy and more on action but I don't play this game as a diplomatic game.

I'm prob not a 4x player but for a 4x game this was decent. not too much downtime and decent emphasis on combat. rating likely to stay around 6. won't seek out more plays but ok to play.

Second play was with the expansion. Asymmetry introduces the possibility of imbalance. It requires (as the designer/publisher says) experienced players but while I enjoyed the play alright, I'm not sure I'll put in the number of plays to get the best out of the expansion. 

Overall, it felt like an adequate 4x but possibly reinforced my opinion that I don't like 4x that much, especially when combat comes down to some form of dice rolls (though mitigable).

RATING: 7
Playtime seems hugely understated and the components could have been a lot better but there does seem a lot of ways to score points and earn victory. Some very nice mechanisms in this game but also a lot of randomness from the dice because that's what they do. Double movement is great and gives great opportunity for that moment of bluff and double bluff and also the moment where two fleets of ships are trying to avoid one another but move to the same place and all hell breaks loose. I do find the 1/2 points all over this game very pointless. Just double the points on everything for crying out loud. I also think the 3 points for Chancellor is too high. You've already had a significant bonus for being the chancellor by acting first and deciding extra actions so it's value is too high at the end of the game. I doubt I would buy but I'd certainly but up for some more games in the future. 1 Play

A short version of Twilight Imperium, a game that I haven't played yet.  I like it, I'm not sure how to win it yet :)  Definitely one to play some more.

Note: as mentioned in some threads, the component quality is not the best. I made some mods to the ship boards to make the upgrade chits fit better, and also recommend using the ship "sideboards" that are available on BGG.

Oh, and the game doesn't come with enough dice for each player.  I bought a bunch from Thoughthammer when they had their closing sale, to ramp up the handfulls of dice throwing!

As someone who LOVES complex games and ADORES 4X Games:
Bloated Design with extremely steep learning cliff (yeah, no curve there for first timers). Lots of mechanisms that require you to either remember or look all over the board to make sure you stay aware of all the cost modifiers from Laws, Systems, research and maybe some techs or abilities and actions.
Also, first part of a round is a double bidding thing, but you have to already calculate in your head what resources you will need for the rest of the turn to even know how much you can afford to bid ...

AP nightmare.

Overly complex and terribly long for what it attempts to do.

RATING: 8
I like this as a somewhat more tactical orientated TI3, and a more straightforward eclipse.  It feels like every turn is important and every action gets you closer to victory.  The game can take quite some time still, so be sure to be playing with the right players who won't give up a small ways into it when it's taking too long, or after they've lost a single battle, there is plenty of opportunity to come back.  Can not wait to add in the expansion and take another go at it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a good game. Some of the components are a bit frustrating and could have been more practical. I enjoyed my playings of this title. 

However, the space 4X genre is kind of in vogue right now, and its hard to compete. I think this one is inferior to Eclipse in a few ways, so it ended up losing out the fight for table time. I'd be willing to play again, and if there were a couple less competitors in the same genre I think it would get more play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
definitely a TI lite in respects, and has its own flavor that makes it a unique/different experience... would never replace TI, though. 

all the mechanics and phases of the game are very solid. very good work for a 4X medium weight game.

cons:
- definitely needs a paper-component upgrade (ships are fine). use an exacto-knife when punching things out.

hopes:
- expansion with some asymmetry of species
- anything to add a tiny bit of bargaining, open negotiations (trading/selling/buying resources between players along with the markget? etc...)
- upgraded component production in future printing/edition
- an OCR instructions PDF would be nice. helps to search things out faster.

in the top 3 of 2012 releases for me

RATING: 6
The game might play out similarly since there aren't special race powers and everyone starts similar to each other.

Bidding is important only for victory points and reaction cards. Neat simultaenous hidden movement system but due to symmetrical board play and obvious victory point values, there is not too much room for guessing. It is safer to go for VP by attacking neutrals on board and then occupying territory. If players have weaker ships, they can be farmed for VP.

Lighter than TI and a bit faster, but still a long game. Very little exploration, more of a 3X game.

Second edition components are much better than the first. Fewer ships than other space empire games. Modular ship upgrading for some customization.

RATING: 7
Pretty good game that scratches the 4X itch without having to commit the time normally required of them.  While I feel that the WMDs are ridiculous (something about them screams a requirement for single-use, imo), overall the game runs smoothly for something that could be perceived as fiddly.

A few things could be better: ship density - I want more than two ships of each type, dammit - and simultaneous movement.  I'm not sure how the latter could be improved because it does create an essential deception that adds to Exodus' edge, but it also can be incredibly fiddly and time consuming for a game that is supposed to streamline the typical 4X trappings.

That being said, what I enjoyed a lot were the political cards (laws, resolutions, executive orders) and the technology tree.  In my playthrough, I was way too distracted by the technology tree to, you know, actually win the game, but that just goes to show how much of that part of the game I really enjoyed.

Overall, I would play this again as it's the "short" 4X that you can get done in an evening.  In contrast, the other popular comparison is Eclipse, which I don't even consider a 4X.  That is JASE masquerading as a space game.

Gosh this requires a big table. We had to cut down the map size significantly to fit in on the table and so the game we played was more of a walkthrough that a actually game however we all got a good feel for the game and all of us came away and said we would like to play again when we get that bigger table set up. 

The chancellor/vice-chancellor having victory points and things to do in game is nice however I would have liked to see abilities on the other cards as that would give a reason for wanting to be number 3 in the succession or would boost the player stuck with the number 5 or 6.

Tokens were bloody awful to punch out and a lot of them are now damaged and they are all very thin. I think this is one area for improvement however the game itself plays remarkable well. Rulebook layout is not the best and a few clarifications are required. 

It is generally compared to both Twilight struggle and to eclipse. Whilst I prefer this to eclipse I would choose twilight imperium over this as the political system in twilight is more developed and more robust, and it is this aspect that I particularly enjoy, however if I was in the mood for lighter more combat orientated games this would be the game I turn to.

First and only play with 3 players took over 7 hours! This was obvious a learning game and maybe played in a style the game is not meant for. We played with the rules written in the updated rule book and I don't think we made any mistakes. I will play again, but hesitant.

The other players have played Eclipse at least once. I have played Eclipse at least 20 plays. 
My bias is obvious, but not wanting to throw exodus under the bus. I do like several aspects to the game.
Dislikes:
-Way to long (thought it would play on first play closer to 4 hours not 7+)
-Movement is not satisfying and battles feel less important
-Politics phase is ehhh
-graphic design is sufficient but eclipse is way easier to understand 
-the amount of playing two actions is too limiting
-fiddly in how the movement phase works and all the calculations of money during the action phases and politics phase
likes:
-Rockets are fun!
-Good tech tree and discounts idea is pretty cool
-techs seem to have some good combo potential 
-movement of population gives some good tension
-we did not play this way as much but cohabitation on the planets has some strategic potential
Unsure:
-  hopefully plays will take less time after each play
-don't think this will ever play faster than a game of Eclipse
- really want to like the game enough to not feel cheated of missing out on playing something else

Was interested in this, but there are some things I'm not keen on: I don't like the idea of hitting other planets by using distant rockets- doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't you send a fleet of ships to destroy a planet? Also, the number of fleets/ships is rather small. It's difficult for a game to feel epic with so few ships. Too bad. Eclipse is still the go-to.

RATING: N/A
Exodus: Proxima Centauri is an epic space opera that ticks all the boxes! It offers 4X type game play (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate; though, admittedly, exploration is almost non-existent) and a marvelous sandbox style tech tree (research whatever you want, whenever you want).

Through careful resource and action management, each player works to establish their own space empire by expanding their reach and colonizing new worlds and by building an armada of war ships in order to quash the Centaurian Resistance and to defeat the other players in space combat.

Add political intrigue to all this, and you have yourself a magnificent game! The game scales wonderfully between 2-6 players and is finally a game that can successfully pass off as "Twilight Imperium 3: Light!" Instant favorite!

the weapons of mass destruction was a pretty interesting concept, but over all this game felt lacking. If compared to eclipse, I had a sense of satisfaction with being my race.

A very fun 'civilization' game with a great technology tree mechanic. I also really like the resource collection and starship customization. The rules are a bit of a slog to understand the first time through, but once you get it it's surprisingly easy to play and a much faster game than it seems. The standard 7 round game actually seems to be over just a little too fast (I think next time we play, we'll go nine rounds), but that's probably to make the game a little easier to learn, since the rulebook does include a number of more advanced variants to choose from. I do wish they had included some plastic bases for the starships - just laying them on the board doesn't work very well or look very nice.

I really like this game.  It has potential to be grow into something spectacular with repeated play.  However, a few things hold it back for me:  
- the tech tree is amazing but with the expansion and addition of specific player races and powers it feels scripted, you "should" do this...  
- The "forced" combat system when you land in the same space as an opponent is frustrating and less than helpful in terms of strategic planning 
- I think that military and weapons are still too overpowered in this design - It is hard to imagine someone being able to compete if they don't spend a substantial effort on defence.

90% of this games mechanics were stolen from eclipse. The comparisons are huge. Where the differences lay are that I think eclipse has a more diverse tech tree allowing for more varied builds... I think I prefer eclipses rationale with the discs being placed on different actions though the action card mechanic is certainly the most outstanding aspect of exodus

I think it would be greatly improved by having unequal starting conditions possibly by dealing out cards and asking people to select 2 starting advantages (like in say Tzolkin).

I would definitely play this again over a nice day long session but don't consider it on par with eclipse

RATING: 6
(07/19/2014) Comment based on one play of the revised edition.

This is a thematically dense, space war game, with some intriguing/innovative game mechanics that attempts to dethrone TI3, but fails miserably due to clunky and annoying game play, as well as lack of personality due to too much abstraction. For the same reasons, it does not even displace Eclipse. 

I had a terrible first game, possibly due to having less access to crystal platinum (2 hexes), compared to the other two who had more (3 and 4 hexes, respectively). I was not annoyed with the fact that I was doing poorly, as much as I was annoyed with the game play. Being highly touted as the replacement for TI3 and Eclipse, I went in with high expectations.

The components for the revised edition are gorgeous, with everything screaming epic-ness. The box is heavier than most Euros, given the size. The artwork, the graphics, the layout, all were top-rate. Rules were easy to understand, although there were many questions throughout the game that were not covered by the rules or FAQ.

However, it is the gameplay and/or flow where I was disappointed and frustrated. The turn order is sequential, with all players completing a phase, before moving on the the next: resetting the market, collecting resources, voting for laws, voting for turn order, executing actions, firing weapons of mass destruction, and two movement impulses (each with a programming phase before it).

There are three types of resources in Exodus, each with an emphasis towards a specific aspect: Crystal Platinum, CP, (blue) for technology, bidding, and building ships, as well as weapon upgrades; Axinium (red) is required for building more powerful ships; and Phasium (green) for building weapon upgrades. Planets in each system hex is assigned a 1D6, which tracks the resource as it is mined and depleted, much like resource depletion in Starcraft: The Board Game. This is a nice touch. Players can get refinery techs that allow them to extract these resources at a faster rate (much like the Slavery option in Antiquity), and depleting them quickly. The first phase of each turn is resource collection.

A political phase follows, where three politics cards are revealed, and the players "vote" with a simultaneous blind bid of CP. The card with the highest votes is implemented immediately, or affects the current turn, or becomes a permanent law for the rest of the game. Some of the cards can be game-changing, while others are not as meaningful or as exciting. A blind bid for turn-order immediately follows, again with players spending CP. In terms of movement, where ships move simultaneously, turn-order is not significant. However, for getting access to "reactions", which are a rough equivalent of strategy card secondaries in TI3, turn-order is very important. Thus, players surrounded with more CP-rich systems will tend to do better (leading to an economic snowball), eventually being able to "buy" the turn order from players with weaker economics. While the blind-bid is a familiar game mechanic, there are few constraints, except for how much CP one has, on how much one can bid. There seems to be too much granularity, and too much of a range. If one player is producing huge amounts of CP, there is very little incentive to bother voting for political cards and/or turn order.

An action phases follows politics, where players secretly select one of six different action cards: research, trade, build, mine, upgrade, and banking. This has a similar feel to the programming of action cards in Ad Astra. The actions are revealed and resolved in turn-order. Each card has a second action, called a "reaction", which can be invoked once by any player. In turn-order, a player may invoke their own reaction, or another player's reaction (with a cost in population). Research allows a player to purchase a tech on their player tableau. Trade allows exchanging of one resource into one of the other two at some rate. Build allows building of ships in one's home system (all ships start in the home system, just like Nexus Ops). Mining allows replenishment of depleted resources on planets. Upgrading allows purchase of new and more powerful weapons and/or shields, much like in Eclipse. Banking is like the prospector role in Puerto Rico, giving 4 CP income. Like in other games, some actions will dominate during portions of the game, such as research being selected heavily early on, while mining is used much later as the planets start to get exhausted of resources.

The way players can acquire technology is much like the tech tree in Clash of Cultures, where cubes are placed in holes in the player's tableau. However, unlike CoC or TI3, there are no prerequisites for any tech. A player can buy the most expensive tech, for example, anti-matter cannons, right off the bat, if they have the CP to do so. However, buying cheaper techs, as well as a variety, builds up discounts cumulatively. This is nice, as it avoids the "lottery" feel of Eclipse. Unfortunately, there is no VP given for tech advancement in Exodus. Still, the techs all are meaningful in the game-sense, much more so than CoC or TI3. Although buying any tech gives great flexibility, I find this thematically weak. It is frustrating to see another player suddenly jump to some ridiculous tech, like anti-matter cannons, where they did not put forth the effort to build up to it, but were able to simply buy it because they had a lot of CP. There are several laws and resolutions that can greatly skew the tech advancement of any game. Again, here, whomever has more CP will do better.

The building and upgrading of ships is a much simplified and streamlined adaptation of Eclipse. Blueprints for four ship types are available, with sufficient differentiation to make it interesting. As for upgrades, weapon techs generally increase the number of dice thrown in combat. Shield techs absorbs hits, much like the hull spaces in Eclipse. Engine techs can be purchased to allow ships more movement, beyond the one hex space in the beginning. However, players are limited to exactly eight ships--two of each type. Thus, there will be no grand space battles like in TI3, or to a lesser extent, Eclipse. Combat in Exodus actually felt more like isolated skirmishes, and this was rather disappointing.

Trading is simply some exchange rate with the bank, and not with the other players. This is keeping in line with the back story of Exodus, but lacks the richness of trading one finds in Ad Astra, or establishing trade agreements in TI3. Trading earlier gives more favorable exchange rates, emphasizing turn-order, but in a 3-player game, doesn't seem significant. In a 6-player game, it may.

After the action phase, players may fire their weapons of mass destruction, which are deep space missiles fired from one planet to another. Depending on the tech, these "rockets" can destroy resources, population, or wipe out entire systems! Unfortunately, due to group think, we did not fully explore this aspect of the game, where we could have exercised several types of terror weapons.

Finally, this is all followed by two movement impulses. Players secretly program movement for each of their ships (up to eight of them!), much like Robo Rally, and very much similar in feel to Starfleet Battles or Game of Thrones. Although the token programming is very clumsy, it does its job well--it could easily be replaced with written orders. Movement for all ships is conducted simultaneously, where ships could pass each other in a given hex. Wherever ships make contact, combat occurs. Combat is as simple as in CoC, where a number of D6 are thrown, and 5s and 6s are hits. There are no tech modifiers.

Much like Eclipse, it is a VP "point salad", where players get VP for occupying systems with ships, having the most population (players can "share" a planet), destroying non-player "resistance" alien ships, occupying the center hex (which is the council hex, having similar importance just like in TI3 and Eclipse), and turn-order, at the end of a 7-turn game. Because it is point salad, there is none of the tension of the VP-race aspect in TI3, and there are no hidden surprise points in Eclipse; it can be relatively easy to see who will win.

There is no exploration like in Eclipse. However, the location and relative strength of the resistance (think the "Ancients" from Eclipse) are fixed on the board. The game board is geomorphic, and scales nicely from two to six players. However, there is relatively little differentiation of the planets. There are three types of planets: blue, red, and green, each with a small range of starting resource levels. There may be "moons" that sometimes hinder population movement. There is very little "personality" of each system hex; it is just essentially a rock with resources.

All in all, Exodus has a nice collection of game mechanics, including some improvements over Eclipse and TI3. However, I could not help but think: "I could have been playing Eclipse and/or TI3," while playing Exodus. I missed most of all the fluidity of play of Eclipse's action tokens and TI3 command counters. I wanted to take a number of actions, in rapid sequence, but instead felt constricted through the playing action cards. The playing of reactions was usually meaningless and frustrating to me, since I could not buy my way out of last place in turn order. I wanted to build a fleet of ships, like in TI3, but was limited to eight. I wanted to outfit my few ships with powerful weapons, but all I got was more dice to roll; there was no sense of differentiation. For example, I attacked several ships, and all I remember is that my friend rolled 35D6 and wiped out my fleet with one roll. In Eclipse, there is some sense of ship-to-ship combat. In TI3, there are grand fleets, with war suns and tens of fighters. There's tech that gives ships personality, while the tech in Exodus feels generic. Mecatol Rex is a place of great contention and drama in TI3. The galactic center defense in Eclipse gives great tension, because it is the gateway to the other players. However, the center in Exodus is of no importance, except during the last turn. The political phase in TI3 is equally filled with tension, with players balancing influence and exhaustion of planets, while Exodus is simply a measurement of how much CP you can produce and willing to spend. The good and desirable laws and resolutions are self-evident in Exodus and seem one-dimensional; there isn't the breadth and depth that is possible in TI3. All these stark differences in personality of the three games became painfully evident, due to the constricting turn-order sequence of Exodus.

At 4.5 hours for our first 3-player game, it was almost as long as my first play of a 5-player Eclipse game, and coming close to one of the shorter games of TI3. For all the time invested, I expected an epic experience. Instead, I got a generic one. A collection of good mechanics, but thoroughly lacking in personality and feel. It feels more like fielding gladiators than of space fleets. Yes, I'd rather play Eclipse or TI3. Sorry, but this is not a TI3 replacement, nor does it replace Eclipse. It is a lukewarm "6". I am willing to give this another try, but I am not too enthusiastic about it.

I was quite disappointed with this game. It drags on for too long, there is not much player interaction (I don't count the combat as player interaction with this game, because you HAVE to do it). It's a shame that the game doesn't come enough numbered chips with this game if you play it with 6 players. The simultaneous movement could have been solved better. Quite static game, not much dynamics. Would only play again, if the rest of the group wanted to play it. :/

This is a marvelous game. 

There is so much packed into the experience of playing this game. It has tense strategic decisions, long-term planning, tactics, bidding, politicking, combat, exploration, resource management... all orchestrated together into a nice, tight, space game! 

The plays can be pretty long (averaging about 3-4 hours for my group, regardless of the amount of players), but every game has been satisfying for the amount of game you get out of the time put into each play. An interesting narrative always seems to develop out of the playthough, which makes for memorable moments and entertaining games regardless of the outcome. Winning is tough and feels very rewarding, and victory never seems out of reach until the final score is tallied. 

One of my favorite games, and probably my favorite "tons-o'-plastic figurines" game.

I didn't like the political mechanisms - they acted as a shoot the leader.  I thought the ships were not different enough and it was to easy to build a fleet and the fleet size was too small (max of 8 ships).

Exodus: Proxima Centauri features my favorite game theme so I was super excited to play it. Sadly there were some issues that prevented me from really enjoy the game.

The worst by far is the abysmal game components. At this point in my gaming career, I have opened hundreds upon hundreds of games and all of them came with better game components than Exodus. I spent around 3 AND A HALF HOURS only to punch the game components, I kid you not. I had to use a blade to cut the components out so they won’t get damaged but still I had to glue many of them together. At the end I had a headache and I was angry at the game. Exodus has the worst components sheets I have seen bar none. To clarify, once the components are punched, they don’t look that bad, but punching them was sheer hell. Some of the components are of different size so they don’t match the ship designs. 

The resources are represented by small cylinders, they look very cool on the board, but they can be easily displaced so they aren’t very practical. The game comes with too few dice per player. Still those are minor issues for me. 

When I had the components out, I began reading the rules, I understood them very easily, but the game manual´s quality is also very bad. Some letters disappear into the edge of the page, it seems it was a prototype rather that the finished product. It also offers little details in the use of some technologies (like Civil Transport). 

After reading the rules, Exodus seemed like a good game, but still it is very long for what it offers. It has playtime comparable to Twilight Imperium without offering the same game experience. The rockets are very novel and at first I was very excited to try them. It seemed great to build a weapon capable of destroying a whole planet, but in practice, those rockets are overpowered as there is no possible defense against them and they are aimed to the player who is currently winning. Killing population this way is ridiculously easy and destroying planets is easy as well. To clarify I think the idea is great but I find them to be very unfair, unbalanced and prone to cause a kingmaking situation, a very negative thing for a game that has this weight and length.

I feel the game has a healthy dose on uncontrollable luck, everything is controlled via dice, the battles (obviously), the trades, the mining, the rockets, the colonization of asteroids. There are some ways to mitigate this via technologies, but the luck in the political/centurian cards cannot be mitigated. 

On the good side, I really liked many of the game mechanisms, I like that there are no pre requisites to buy a technology, I like that you can customize your ships, I like that the whole galaxy is visible to all since the beginning and the combat VPs and bonuses aren’t hidden. I love the dual card system of main actions and reactions. Many of these mechanisms are borrowed from Eclipse but improved so I like Exodus a bit more. I also really like the simultaneous movement but the chips that came with the game are insufficient for this purpose. 

Bottom line, Exodus: Proxima Centauri has some good ideas in it, I like it a bit better than Eclipse but Twilight Imperium is still the king for me. With the component issue, I feel cheated on because the game was very expensive and if I want to upgrade the components I have to dish out even more money, so I feel I have to pay for their mistake if I want to have a functional game. IMO this speaks poorly of the game company, I work in sales and I would never do anything like that. When I bought the game, there was already plans for the second edition but I didn’t know because I never do any research before buying a game, my mistake. For now I’m leaning toward getting rid of it but I feel I would be cheating on someone so perhaps I will give it away. For the game rating, I tried to be very impartial and I tried to only have into account the gameplay experience, had I rated the game with the components issue in mind, the rating would be around 3.0.

"How about we take the space 4x/strat genre, and streamline the hell out of it."
Prefer it to Eclipse, TI3 beats it but this can hit the table far more often. Never played Hegemonic, which, afaict, is the only other major hex-based space 4x/strat.

RATING: 7.5
I like the political cards and the mechanic of voting (feels very similar to Warrior Knights).  I like how the board starts fully set up but wish there was some more variety to the planets.  I really like the tech tree but would prefer that you have to build on it sequentially.  And I really like the rockets and the ability to completely destroy an opponents planet.  I don't like role selection when others can benefit from it and this game addresses this nicely.  Other can use your card but only at a population penalty.  Nicely done.  Components in the first edition are some of the worst I've seen in a while.  Punching them was difficult and many of the pieces took damage from the think plastic covering peeling off.  The ship blueprints are clunky, I prefer the way Eclipse handled that mechanic.

Revised Edition: as such this game seems very unpolished.  Not a bad game, and it has some interesting elements (political, economics, action declarations/use), but it is pretty rough.  
There are areas that are blatant misses in my view--one being the similarity between the planets that have little variation (And no exploration--they are defined in setup).
The lack of variety between factions is also disappointing, and harms the potential of this game. 
Ship modification is unsatisfying, and the combat as bad or worse than Eclipse (its weak point IMO).

I played once for now and with some wrong rules, but it's very enjoyable with minor flaws (tokens for moving ships especially). I think I can rate it higher after playing with full proper rules. It's not as big and complex as it seems at first which is a good thing. Still one of the bigger games I played so far.

2014-04-15 I played again with proper rules. I made a mistake forgetting about how big the game is and it overwhelmed me a little bit. So I need to play again to have full picture. For now the rating is down by 0.1 to 8.5 :)

2014-11-11 After rethinking it's an 8. Still high rating anyway.

2016-02-20 - After almost two years since last play I decided to purchase this game.

This game is long, and that's my only problem with it. Tech tree is fun and unique, but nobody I play with including myself knows what they're doing yet and can't plan advanced strategy because it's too long and only on certain occasions do people want to play a 5 hour game. Wish there was race powers.

This game should be 9/10 but it's 8 because of crappy components. From an esthetic point of view and usefull point of view. But it's Exodus only disadvantage because everything else in this game is just AMAZING. TI + Eclipse but faster. And you can be a Chancelor (Palpatine). And you can build your own unique ships so your fleet is different than your oponents fleets. Politics + economics + space battles. You have a chance for multi-combo! And technology tree! I don't like such games, I like coops, no strategy games but Exodus makes me very happy even if I'm not winning.

Nice game, Second Edition provides new components and erases the major issues I had with first edition. Definately a fun game to play!

You like TI? Give this a try - plays much shorter, focus lies more on battle and there's nothing better than pulverizing whole planets with your weapons of mass destruction!

Unfortunately, this game was made obsolet for me by playing Eclipse the first time...

By far my least favourite of the three space 4X flagships: Eclipse, Twilight Imperium and Exodus. What is this supposed to do well again?

I found the graphical design extremely confusing, the gameplay totally obtuse, and incredibly fiddly. Political and trade options are there, but do not impact the game a lot. I don't see any reason why this should be the "true" TI3 light game (over Eclipse). 

On top of that: IT'S JUST NOT FUN!

Decent gameplay, but way too long. It's nice that it's not as abstracted as eclipse, and not as mindnumbingly boring as TI3

RATING: 8
tougher for me to find a balance compared to eclipse.
I have difficulties seperating the movement phase from the actions phase.

this game is played on a smaller and set map thus encouraging conflict.

I was master on the research track with 14 cubes there but this doesn't result in points.

best thing probably is that you can annihilate planets. allthough I ended up with 18 points in oast spot. winner had 25 I was the only one to destroy planets. and that was a lot of fun. different enough from eclipse .. next up ti second edition

In Exodus: Proxima Centauri, the six factions fight for dominance in an epic empire-building game, striving to build a new human empire on the ashes of the Centaurian civilization. Each player will build his own space fleet of customized ships and conquer new planets, fight the Centaurian Resistance and the other players, negotiate and vote for political decisions, research Centaurian technologies, and much more.

Like a Twilight Imperium light (minus the race powers). Expansion Exodus: Generals helps fix that issue however.

This was good...but needed some work.  Unfortunately, with the new addition they didn't create anything other than print-and-play corrections which won't work with existing cards and parts, or you had to go buy the game again.  I offered to donate mine to a game store that ran events for schools and children who can't afford games themselves (that store is awesome that way) but they wouldn't discount a new copy or anything.  So we switched to TwiImp and auctioned this off at Fallcon30 to a new home.

After a video review

Some mechanics looks interesting, but in general many of the mechanics does not hook me up like:

- The resource management
- The low amount of ships
- Ship Design
- Secret ship movement.

Some expansions seems to allow solo play. The revised edition makes it more convenient to play. Still the game is much more focused on resource management which is not really my focus.

Scales very well with all player counts...

Great game. The rating will probably go up but I have only played it the once and was getting to know the rules.

After a single game, it seems like this is the sort of game that would sing with the proper crowd, but I'm unlikely to play it often enough to let it spread its wings. In a way, I already own two other games which do similar stuff to it - Starcraft and Clash of Cultures. This one is a bit like a mash-up of the two, with the unlucky element of having dice-driven combat, which I'm not a fan of.

I hope to give it a few more goes and check it out with the expansion, but I'm not sure how that's going to work out.

When people say "Twilight Imperium Lite", it does not mean a light game. Exodus is a meaty, yet streamlined domination game with some negotiation thrown in. I love how the interplanetary rockets turn from a cold war into an arms race the second someone takes the first step in arming themselves.

RATING: 7.5
This game has been compared to Eclipse and although there are superficial simularities, I find them to be very different games. Eclipse is much more of an all-encompassing game with many different roads to victory, where Exodus is much more of an old school wargame. That's not to say that Exodus is very simple and doesn't offer anything new, because it has some interesting mechanics and it plays much quicker than comparable predecessors like Twilight Imperium.

If I want a more intricate game, I'll choose Eclipse. If I have got an entire day for a truly epic game, I'll choose Twilight Imperium. However, Exodus can not be beat if you want a quick and fun 4X game with lots of fighting. It's like that action movie that is nowhere near the best movies ever made, but you just enjoy everytime you watch it.

Significantly better than Eclipse, but still not quite the rich metagame experience of TI3. I especially like that while there is a little resource management, it is not the core focus as it is in Eclipse. Furthermore, there is no stupid unpredictable map tile draw, and the vp rewards for combat are calculable, rather than risking winning a fight and still drawing six 1's from the vp bag while your opponent draws a single tile and it's a 4 as in Eclipse. 

I can see this filling the space conquest niche in our gaming group and would put it on my own wishlist were it not for the fact that the components and graphic design are the most absolute shite I have ever seen in a board game. (Ergo the reason for the lower rating - aesthetics and component quality MATTER.)

RATING: 8
Average area control game with two players, but a very fun political strategy game with more than two. We really enjoy the open tech tree and politics, but find the complexity of the rules a bit of a downside; even five games deep I'm still not comfortable playing without the rule book nearby to figure out how many dice for which WOMD or some quirk that happens rarely. 

For a game that plays in two hours, there's a lot of great fun ganging up on the leader (either politically or with weapons) and the lack of reward for turtling makes for a lot of player interaction.

Fun, solid 4X game.  It's hard not to compare it to Eclipse even though the game differs in several ways.  Exodus focuses more on attack and has politcal offices that are bid on each turn which determines play order.  I prefer Eclipse because it's more elegent and has more paths to victory.  Also, the components in this game are uneven - some are nice and others are subpar.

An absolutely amazing 4x game. It covers everything I could ever want in this sort of game. The tech trees are great, the way resources are handled is both fresh and streamlined, and the turn structure is very simple to understand. Especially when combined with the expansion, there is so much to explore in terms of factions and technology that I don't think this could ever get old.

That being said, this is perhaps the best game I will never play again.

The reason being is that combat is the main way you win the game. If you aren't willing to outfit your ships and engage in battles with others, you aren't going to win, period. The expansion mitigates this a bit, but there's really no route to victory through peaceful wins or turtling. Even though this is a better game at what it sets out to accomplish, I prefer Star Trek: Ascendancy and Empires of the Void for a 4x experience. Having a way to win through peaceful means is a big draw for me, and it's not something that can be done here. I don't mind player conflict, but I don't want whether I win or lose to come down to a series of die rolls against another player in a longer game like this. If an expansion could allow for less combat-oriented strategies, I would pick this up again in a heartbeat.

Bleh, this game is just average to just plain bad. The art sucks (the revised edition improved things a little bit, but the typography is still horrible), and the mechanics are clunky. The components at least are better on the revised edition. There are some good ideas there (most of them copied from TI3 and Eclipse), but I'd say that if you want a Euro(-ish) 4X space game, stick with Eclipse. Or go the heavy route with Twilight Imperium 3, which is still king.

Also, upgrading the first edition version with the upgrade pack was a pain in the butt. The instructions were not clear.

The game is better than the score I am giving it, but its problem for me is that it falls short in a competitive field of sic-fi games in my collection.

Nothing the game does is bad, but playing it only reminded that I need to play those games again.  My wife said she enjoyed it, but for me it fell flat.  Sold at DTC 2016.

Scratches the TI itch in a shorter amount of time.  Not a better game than TI mind you, but sufficient if you have a short amount of time.

Edit: Lowering my rating on this one.  This did not go over well with my game group.  There is much too much book keeping, and it seems like some mechanisms were just pasted on and unnecessary that really slow down play.  I thought this might give Eclipse a run for its money, but it is not even close.

I know people have different opinions on games, and everything is subjective.  But, the people giving this game a 10 and saying how utterly amazing it is must be living on a different planet.

The component quality is beyond awful.  NSKN have admitted this but are now making people pay £30 to get a replacement pack to fix their mistake.

The rules are not only awful, but the gameplay is just horrendous.  Fiddly, badly designed rules which appear to have not been properly tested since those of us that tried to play this game found it unplayable.

One of the worst purchases I made and glad to have managed to sell it on.

RATING: 6
Your traditional space opera affair with expansion, exploitation and extermination aplenty. The tech tree is nicely done, as you feel like you want to do everything, but there are only so many actions in the game. There's a Nexus Ops feel, in that it encourages you to un-turtle because all the VPs are gained by getting out and exploring and exterminating. That's good. The problem is that it plays in about four times the time without giving four times the bang. The most interesting decisions are in the actions and the tech's, but the most time is spent doing the simultaneous movement (which is clunky) and combat phases which, while important, is really just spending time playing out the consequences of the decisions you've made earlier re what you've invested in. So the game feels a little unbalanced - you ideally want a higher proportion of time spent making interesting decisions. Of course the game descends (like most in this genre) to a bunch of mega dice-rolling battles at the back end of the game. If your group is a fan of the genre and can afford the time investment, it'll be fun. If you're not, steer clear. I'm not a huge fan so it's not a game I'll play often, but if and when I do, it's probably as decent as they come so I'll keep it around, if only to have something decent of that ilk for the time it’s needed.

Fun Slick 4X Space Board Game with a Euro feel !! The Tech Tree makes sense !! The Mechanisms make sense !! Gameplay feels great !! Dice !! Ship battles !! Blowing up planets !! Ship upgrades !! 4X !! Doesn't take 4+ hours to play !! ('cept for when learninig, maybe.)

Slight learning curve, of course. This first edition has it's flaws (production problems, wooden tokens that roll off the table, not enought tokens and dice sometimes) , BUT THE GAME ITSELF IS OUTSTANDING !!

Better with 3+ players, but the 2 player game can crescendo to some devastating finales.

RATING: 8.5
Finally got to try this game the other week. We played a four player game. All of us have played Eclipse, TI, etc so comparing was of course on the table. 

When it comes to quality of components it's really poor. the design and artwork is ok, but the punchouts are really bad. Poor punching equipment makes torn pieces (even though I tried very carefully to cut them out with a scalpel) and pieces with varying sizes that doesn't relly fit together. It doesn't affect gameplay, but it certainly affect the feel for the game. 

Wooden components are very small and round (cylindrical). This affects gameplay and certainly playing time, as they're very fiddly to use. 

All in all there is a lot of fiddling with lots of small components that take unnecessary time. According to the box a four player game should take 2-3 hours, it took us 4½ hours, and I can't see how it could be much faster. None of us are slow players. 

So how does the game play? Well, it has some aspects that Eclipse lack, like politics. It playes a minor part compared to TI, but it's nice. Science, ships and upgrading is very similar to Eclipse and works as well.

Moving is more limited than in Eclipse, and maybe not as necessary since only one of us bought faster engines until the last round. The universe is also more dense and balanced than it can be with exploring in Eclipse. 

As with Eclipse missiles can totally break the game, as it did in our try. One player built 6-7 Biochemical Rokets and was emptying the board of population every turn. At the end of the game he had 11 bio rockets and I had 7. The winner of the game was the one furthest away from us with several ships to move population saved on his home planet to repopulate all the "free" planets where we had wiped out the population. 

Since this was ongoing during the entire game it's difficult to decide if this is a typical or abnormal game. 

We also had an unbalanced random board where all the green resources ended up far away and wasn't accessed until the last few rounds. Tha player with the many bio rockets got his green by trading, since ha had a LOT of blue income (again due to the unbalanced board).

We also got stuck in the situation where the chancellor stayed with the same player during most of the game: Since the chancellor gets to "harvest" first he gained much more money than the players he shared the almost depleated planets with so he could always afford to bid way more for the chancellor role. And he never mined more than he could harvest on each planet. 

I still liked it a lot and after a first try I'll rank it 8.5, to be adjusted with more tries.

1 Play - an interesting game, with some great and interesting ideas. the simulataneous moving is fun and interesting, but also fiddly toward the end. the research tree seems needlessly large. Some mechanics probably could have been streamlined for a quicker game. Felt a little unfocussed. But all in all, a great and FUN game. Ultimately prefer eclipse though, and this does not replace eclipse or appear to be different enough for me add to my collection.

It's like TI3 and Eclipse had a baby. It took a lot of what I liked from both and made it into it's own unique game. It's far from perfect, but it does give me that TI3 feeling in potentially a shorter amount of time. The rules were unclear in a few spots, but apparently they've released a slightly updated version online. So far I enjoy it, but I'm not nearly as impressed with it as I was with TI3.

I have only played two "space-themed 4X" games: this, and Eclipse. I am now wondering what exactly that means. This game is almost the exact same game as eclipse, with a little TI thrown in for good measure, but when I said this after the game was over, another one of the players said that it only had a few similarities to Eclipse. I mentioned: same modular ships, same hex-based grid (with starting planets in the EXACT SAME positions), same race of ancients littering the board, same sort of action selection system, same tech tree, same hard-to-hit dice combat system, with just a few small variances thrown in. His response was that TI had all that, too. Which can only lead me to one sad and horrifying conclusion...

Are all 4X games not merely the same type of game, but pretty much the same exact game? If so, why bother making them? Is this the same way that the 18XX games and the crayon rail games are, too; not separate games, but virtually identical games with extremely slight variations each time? If so, why are people buying them? I guess I feel like I'm taking crazy pills right now, because this is blowing my mind.

[b]Comment:[/b] (Revised edition) 
The game is often described as a cross between Eclipse and Twi Imp. From Eclipse, it gets the upgradable space ships mechanic. From Twi Imp it gets a system of playing action cards where you use the primary, and then any player can pay cubes to use any of the secondaries available. The tech tree is imported in style from Clash of Cultures, although it again looks to Eclipse by making lower level technologies provide not a requirement but a discount for the higher level ones.

The unique things about the game are that planets can be shared by multiple players, and endgame points for holding the planet go to most cubes on that planet, or shared in a tie. 

The movement rules are interesting, every hex has a number 1 to 6 on the edge. You take number tokens and log in the moves of each of your ships and simultaneously execute. I thought this was a really fun way to do movement, and bluff your opponents at the same time. I loved how your borders were somewhat fluid, and sometimes fleets would accidentally meet in space and have conflict. This mechanism was met with utter hate from my playgroup unfortunately, and was a major barrier to getting this game played. Unfortunately, the process of gathering and assigning the movement tokens is a bit complicated and fiddly. A better implementation of this system might have kept this game in my collection. I had heard this system got removed and replaced in one of the expansions, but by that point my group was categorically against trying this again.

Combat is rolling dice, and if you get destroyed the ships are easily reconstructed, allowing for a decent comeback if you get blown to pieces.

A flaw of the game might be that the game deeply rewards players for winning in combat. The most punchy player can become a runaway leader by virtue of lucky die rolls, or by picking on weaker fleets. All non-combat points are limited by what's printed on the board and remaining alien tokens. This is perhaps just the nature of the game. Cubes also have a strange component limitation. Players have a limited number of cubes despite that cubes are used for both charts and as people on planets.

What a wildly, WILDLY underrated game.  TI3-lite is a pretty apt descriptor for it, and I mean that in the best possible ways.  

I have a few MAJOR complaints about it:

-First, the build quality.  It would be overly charitable for me to call it "horrendous" (I have 1st edition).  I'm going to be pimping out this game on my own a lot, I think, because the build quality is trash.  And normally I'd knock a game way down for that, but the gameplay was just so good for me.  

-The fractional point scoring.  Why not just double all the point values and do away with fractions?  That wasn't thought-out.

-Rules:  Very ambiguous, tough to "ramp up" to play the game.  Once we got a few rounds in, everything made sense and the game was smooth as silk, but going through the rulebook was just downright painful.  15 pages of incredibly small type in a bad font.

If any other game had these deficiencies, I'd probably drop it all the way down to a 6, but the gameplay just hit on the right notes soo much for me.

The set-up looks a lot like Eclipse, but the gameplay is a lot different. Whereas Eclipse uses the tech tree to score points in a Eurogame style of play, in Exodus, the tech tree is just a mean to better your race in a conflict driven game. 
Still quite interesting though, so it's a shame the finishing of the tiles and tokes are so sloppy

I bought the revised edition after reading that the original release had absolutely horrible quality components.  I am pleased to say that the components in the revised edition are very nice and I don't have any complaints about them from the quality side of things.

The Good:
Like Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition (TI3), you have strategic action cards and I think this game has actually streamlined them better than TI.  The actions are just represented by symbols so each player has know what each means and those actions are not as fiddly as TI3 so they are somewhat easier to remember during gameplay.
This game's combat mechanic is very fast and intuitive to new players.  Just crunch some dice and mark damage each round based on some simple ship part mechanics.
Planets can be claimed by multiple people and there is competition to drain resources before other players do, but to do this you must spend resources to get to be first, which adds a lot of strategy to the game.
There are ways to directly destroy population, resources and even the planets themselves directly without needing to have a space battle, this leads players to need to use their ships to run sabotage missions to the planets firing these missiles.  I think this adds a whole another layer of depth to the game that TI3 and Eclipse do not offer.
I enjoy how the technology tree and discounting works, it is very easy to use and intuitive and probably better than both the TI3 and Eclipse implementations.

That being said, this really has the makings of a good game, but is just brought down hardcore by some very fiddly mechanics that shouldn't have been done and can completey ruin the game.
The bad:
The ship movement phase is extremely fiddly.  This can lead to some players finishing right away and others taking a really long time.  The tokens you need can be really hard to find sometimes and make you lose track of what you were even trying to do from the start.
The ships themselves in comparison to the diagrams on the players sheet are not easy to recognize independently of each other.  In our first game, one of the players kept making the wrong ships and not realizing it until battle, only to be killed easily by another player.  Why didn't this game make all of the ships distinct sizes and styles for each class like what was done in TI3 and Eclipse, this should have been obvious to the designers within the first playtest with some new people.  This problem also makes the movement phase all the more fiddly and confusing.
Trading is confusing.  It was very non-intuitive to us when you get advanced trading that you could essentially use two trades to turn 3CP almost directly into 6CP.  There should just be shorthand on the trade area of the market board for trades like this so you don't have to calculate them every time.
The technology descriptions on the back of the manual have no apparent order (why are they not alphabetical for easy reference)

I would really like to see a newer version come out that addresses the issues I mentioned above and I think this would be an excellent game.

So I got suckered into buying the crap first edition of this game. Early impressions: Box lid too tight and very difficult to open, cheap and flimsy components almost impossible to punch out, completely useless insert, the list goes on. This would have been state of the art in the 1970s. Never with a board game have I come closer to ditching the whole thing in the trash, having endured a whole afternoon of trying to punch out and sort these components. Always do your research before buying, especially when it comes to "deals." Buyer beware, only myself to blame for letting my greed get the better of me.

Ein qua Kickstarter von mir unterstütztes Spiel bisher unbekannter, rumänischer Autoren. Klassisches 4X-Game für bis zu sechs Personen und - lt. Tom Vasal – ein richtig gutes „Twilight Imperium“ ‚light‘ (Spieldauer: 1,5-3 Stunden). Individuell ausrüstbare Raumschiffe, (im Gegensatz zu „Eclipse“) immer vollständig verfügbarer, pro Spiel aber immer nur teilweise ausbaubarer TechTree; Ökonomie ist durchaus vorhanden, nimmt aber – da per definitionem langweilig – nur eine eher beiläufige Rolle ein; intelligentes Bewegungsprocedere mit Fog of War-Effekt; die eigene Aktionsauswahl gibt den anderen Spielern jeweils andere Handlungsoptionen; gutes ‚Politik‘-System (mit dauerhaft gültigen Gesetzen, nur punktuell gültigen Resolutionen usw.). Daß man sich mit den Gegnern Planeten teilen und sie in anderen Teilen der (modularen) Galaxis bekämpfen kann, ist ein weiterer hübscher Mechanismus.

Finally played the game yesterday! Of course, no TI3 but you cannot expect that based on the 2-3 hours this'll take. At some point our rounds were 15-20 minutes, making the full game possible to play in a little over 3.

I really like the tech.. I don't mind the congress but it seems rather superfluous,  choices being not overly important. 

The only downside, for me, is the movement system, which seems unnecessarily fiddly. I think I will try to come up/steal a fix on BGG.

It's tough to describe what I think about this game. It's a good game, I just think it's a bit too long for what you're doing. There feels like some unnecessary steps in the game. I think a couple of the bidding rounds are a bit superfluous and just kind of stop the action, taking you out of the experience. It was fun. The tech tree was cool, albeit a bit easy to achieve with the discounting mechanic. It wasn't quite what I expected, but still okay.

12/31/2015 - i really enjoy this game, and it is my favorite space themed game.  I like it better the eclipse.  however, the base game doesn't include variable starting powers, which i think is very good in a game like this, I don't want to invest in the expansion in order to get variable powers, and my gaming group is enamored of eclipse, so i am trading it off.

The other problem is that whenever i play this, i think that i'd rather play runewars.  they both give me a similar vibe.

I will have to play this game again to give it a fair shake, but the first game (with four players) took over twelve hours to play.  This is because of frequent interruptions, to be fair, but it has left a tainted view.

The game mechanics were interesting and the gameplay seemed fun, but it i really hard to say because of the interruptions and the incredible length.

an initial rating but expecting to rise, while I can see a huge potential in diplomacy/backstabbing and bluffing dimensions within nice cosmic shootouts and tighten resources management..
..and I like that tech. tree a lot, how it works...and WMDs and their ranges!
Certain unpredictability beyond the combat rolls (as for economy and mining stuff) goes along well and bothers me not.
Can't wait to get deeper into that with experienced players to explore various paths in that rat race for VPs...
Turn sequence is a routine after the first play, then it plays smooth and I see that 30-45mins per player doable.. 
It also captures that opening/mid/end play with possible cataclysmic closing (that I usually prefer over the turn2turn VP sums playstile) along with other compressed essences of TI3.. (yet somehow it reminds me more of Empires of the Void, guess for its streamline nature..)

And I can happily forgive some unfortunate component quality if the piece offers a fair amount of game from the intellectual perspective..that Exodus certainly delivers. 
..so I'm keeping it happyly (missing that Supplies and Generals extra cards) and so hopefully it would get some 'popularity' within my circles, to play the best out of it..

E: No plays at all, so it went off :(

Was hoping to be able to rate it higher, but on first play, this game just didn't quite do it for me.  I like the tech tree, but I feel that some options are wildly better than others.  I like the simultaneous actions, but so many of them are just to roll a die and pray it is high.  I like the ship building, but with 5 players we often ended up in kind of a stalemate situation, lest someone sweep in and gather up a bunch of easy points after a brawl.

Also, I hate the components.  They are not of good quality.  And the game is pretty fiddly, so you have to pick them up a lot.

Overall, if you really like epic space games, you should give this game a try.  It may end up being a much better fit for you than it was for me.  I'd probably just rather play a 4-player game of TI:3.  This wasn't that much shorter.  A 6 accurately rates my desire to play this again.

Learning curve but elegant and lots of player interaction, politics, choices but game does a good job keeping organized.

Vassel likes this much better than eclipse as fun short space game.  Nobody has succeeded yet! $48. Tiles much better in new version. "Goto space epic that is (only) 3 hours instead of 6-8 for Twilight Empirium.

Though the quality of the components is not always top notch this is a fantastic game and as the title suggests is actually l lot more fun to play than Eclipse and a whole lot shorter than Twilight Imperium. That said, the game is not without it's faults and it would be worth looking at BoardGameGeek.com for the official variants. 

There was a version 2 and on sale Amazon ... not sure the difference.  Once learn the game is about 45 mins per player.

FINAL CLASSIFICATION

TI 3: 42/50

EPC: 39/50

Eclipse: 28/50

First of all, we should admit that Exodus Proxima Centauri is a very good surprise. I have not been so surprised at a board game for years.

Simultaneous hidden movements, simple but deep politics and trading and, last but not least, the mechanisms of secondary actions available to everyone enable players to experience a full and rewarding space adventure in a very short time. That is total control of the game, which does not mean a lack of key choices.

A random element (in battles) is present, but less important than it may appear. Those who colonize and win battles thanks to well-pondered technological choices are rewarded. The auction system makes the game more interesting and tests your planning.

The material does not really match such a good game, although you may avoid any unpleasant surprising by carefully using a cutter while detaching the tiles and cylinders.

This is a must-try game: any future expansions might move it closer to TI 3 and even oust it from its Galaxy throne…

Twilight Imperium III is still THE Space Opera Reference point. A large, entertaining and very well characterized game. Its long duration is, at the same time, its strongest and weakest spot. It takes dedication, and you need to accept a strong “American” component. It still ranks first, provided you have enough time to spend.

Eclipse is a very well designed game. Its very short duration and quick rules – comparable to EPC – certainly make it attractive, although its many random elements (players’ order, technological development and “go-and-see” combat rules) make its strategy weak, at least in comparison with EPC. In addition to this, politics and trading are absent.

Exodus is an incredible game. Fast playing, continuous forward momentum, battles galore, negotiation and backstabbing BUT with the worst components I've seen in a modern game. To make matters worse the art and graphic design are weak. This game is crying out for Fantasy Flight treatment.

However once you get past that it's incredible. It's almost everything I wanted Eclipse to be, bar the simpler economic system and lack of exploration. At its heart this is a game of fighting and conquering. There's no other ways to score points and this keeps everyone in the same mindset. No one is upset that their peaceful research centric empire was invaded and no lucky tile draws, no lucky chit pulls for VP. 

My one complaint is that ship customization adds little to these games in terms of fun but much in complexity. Let's have more negotiation, more exploration, backstabbing, civilization elements or just exploding starts and upstart aliens. With better production quality and a few tweaks this could be a 10.

Have not played but this is one of worst production I have even seen in board games. The plastic ships have almost no detail. The paper token boards were just horrible.

One play does not a fully formed opinion make, especially since we played with the Reverse Turn Order movement instead of the expansion's smarter Drive Power rules, and messed up a few minor things along the way, BUT it was nonetheless quite fun and I look forward to getting it to the table more.

Very long play duration. A game of Twilight Imperium goes faster in comparison. There are some redeeming factors to Exodus, though, like the spacecraft upgrades and the technology upgrades which seem more meaningful than those of Twilight Imperium.

I have been looking forward to playing this game for awhile. We did not play with simultaneous movement, and I believe that would have added some spice to the game. It really did feel like a lite version of TI3. It wasn't as fulling, but it did scratch the TI3 itch. 

Just bought the Edge of Extinction, so I'm sure once I play it again, and with the expansion, It will move up to a 10.

About [thing=122842][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=122842][/thing] is sort of a 4x game with a sci-fi theme. Sort because there is really no exploration, as the map start all open - there are, however hidden spaceships of the Centaurian Resistance, so this bit you do explore, but isn't truly exploration. Anyway, the other 3x are right here though: there is plenty of fighting (exterminate), expansion and exploiting the planets for resources.

[thing=122842][/thing] is the love-child of [thing=72125][/thing] and [thing=12493][/thing], as it has the blueprints and economics of the former and the politics of the latter. Also, [thing=122842][/thing] has a little in common with the "following" action of TI3, but here is called "reaction" - everyone picks a main action to do, then, by paying population, is possible to do the secondary action of your own card or of someone else.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
In a set number of rounds (7) players will develop their civilization, research for new technologies, colonize other planets, upgrade their armaments, acquire resources to build ships, upgrades and pay for stuff, mining for more resources, move space ships to other sectors, maybe fight the Resistance or other players.

These are all done by choosing from a set of cards - all cards have two actions on it: one in the upper half and other on the bottom half. The one on top is the one the player will execute. Then every player can do, by paying population, the action in the bottom of her own card or that of someone else (it cost more to do that of someone else). This are done twice in the round (for a possible amount of 4 actions). Then is done, if the Chancellor allowed, the bonus action that everyone can do for free.

The next round starts with the political phase, in which players vote for new Laws (which can stay throughout the game) and one-time effects. This are done by picking one of three propositions, in secret, and adding (or not) money - each 1 money adds one vote. The proposition with the most votes passes, and the others are discarded. It is possible to discuss and strike deals in order to reffuse or to approve propositions. Then there is the vote for Chancellor - now is only a matter of money: the player that pays more, will be the new Chancellor, and will be the first to act in the action round; the second will be Vice-Chancellor. The Vice-Chancellor and the Chancellor chooses a bonus action for the round, if any.

During game, what is worth points is winning battles against the Resistance and other players. In the game end, sectors will be scored in favor of the player who has more population on them. Also, every sector in which the player has a spaceship will earn her one point. Finally, the player that is the Chancellor will gain 5 points and the Vice-Chancellor, 3 points; and the control of the central planet is worth 5 points.

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
What action to make, where to go, where to invest resources, where to gain resources, which techs to research, which upgrades to buy and in which ships add them. When to invest population to do extra actions, in which political proposition to vote.

Overall, there is a lot of possilities in every turn, and the game is pretty tight, both in resources as in available actions, and is important to make everything count.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Blends political actions with economic and military actions;
- It lasts for a reasonable amount of time (3hrs) for its complexity;
- The tech tree, while is there, it didn't block the player: if you want to jump ahead and research a tech from the top, you can. The tree is useful to gain discounts;
- Blueprints for the spaceships, so the players can add cannons, shields and drives accordingly to the techs researched, thus making them unique;
- As the whole board is known before hand, players can strategize which places they want to go;
- Hidden movement;
- The mechanic for the duo-actions is pretty good.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- No trading between players;
- No special powers to represent different nations/sects/races;
- Dice based combat, which can make or break some plans and is impossible to control (but there are ways to make the odds be in your favor);
- There isn't that sense and difficulty of managing a big space empire, which [thing=72125][/thing] did so well and elegantly;
- Small number of spaceships makes even "big" battles be about 4 or 5 ships total, which lessens the epic feel of them;
- No points for technologies (like in [thing=72125][/thing]) or other objectives during play (like in TI3), makes the play more one-sided to battles deciding the whole thing.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like a leader craving for resources and techs in order to build the best killing machine before going in a spree of fighting for control of the galaxy.

This happens because what is really worth points in [thing=122842][/thing] is battles. There are points that can be taken elsewhere, but in truth, most of the players will have closer amounts in the control of planets, as is hard to move population around and while doing other actions, isn't often to have much of them to send to colonize. Battles are the way to go, as the winner of a battle gains points equal to the value of each spaceship that she destroyed in the fight, and these can be a lot. Sure, points elsewhere may decide the winner, but these only truly enter in the matter for those sucessful in battles.

While I wish the game had more and different scoring opportunities (like fulfilling objectives set for each round), which could make for someone playing peacefully to win, this isn't this sort of game. You can expect for several battles in the final rounds, and these will decide things. The result won't be known before the closing moments, and this is, indeed, a good thing.

Therefore, go for [thing=122842][/thing] only if you aren't afraid to see blood in the space.

Executes a mix of Eclipse and TI3 pretty well. The moving mechanic is wonky and needs to be totally overhauled (we use pen&paper)Otherwise, the tighter maps offer a very satisfying conflict for those inclined to kick each other in the gut.

We made the game a fun time while playing it, but it's a mediocre game overall.

On the plus side, the technology options are generally well thought out and fairly cost-balanced and interesting.  Everyone also liked the dual-action + cards mechanic.

The downside is... just about everything else.  There's a ton of fiddleyness, a massive amount of luck, and the game is just too long and not interesting enough to be worth it.  

We even ignored the face-down ship movement plotting (which requires you to trust the people you're playing with) which shaved off at least 30 minutes of playtime but the game still vastly overstayed its welcome.

Wrote a review here: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1312593/small-review-grand-game

This game has everything I could ask for in a game of grand conquest, within a time frame that is reasonable.  Every time I play it, I think about it for weeks afterwards, it's great fun!

Update: With the addition of the expansion, this game now has everything.  I was unsure looking at the changes to cards, I thought it would railroad people, but it actually just pushes you in a direction and gives you toys to play with while you still have to be involved with every aspect of the game.  Each faction truly feels very unique.

The best of the 4X for us. Not necessarily the best at any aspect but has a blend of all the things we like and can be played in one session. I will say that the movement system is clunky and needs to be scrapped but still keep it simultaneous. I also really miss exploring the tiles instead of setting up a seeded map at startup.

Καμια σχεση με eclipse πρωτη παρτιδα σημερα 1000 φορες καλυτερο το exodus proxima
Καταδευτερο μπορεις να προσαρμοσεις τη διαρκεια του παιχνιδιου οπως εσυ τη θες αναλογα με το αρχικο modify.
Επιπλεον εμενα μαρεσουν περισσοτερο τα wargames και η μαχη και οχι τοσο τα euro.Το eclipse τεινει προς τα εuro περισσοτερο με αρκετο βαθος και εχει και το explore που δεν γνωριζεις τι tile θα ανοιξει.
Εννοειται η 2η εκδοση σε σχεση με την πρωτη με διαφορα και λογω artwork και για καποια counterakia που μας τα εξηγησε το παιδι που εφερε το παιχνιδι αλλα δε θυμαμαι ακριβως τι.επισης αυτα τα μαυρα για την κρυφη κινηση ειναι λιγο σπαστικα καλυτερα χαρτι και μολυβι
Το μονο που με χαλασε ισως ηταν η στρατηγικη του παιχνιδιου(βαθος ηθελα ενα τικ παραπανω).Στην αρχη ενιωθα οτι ηταν χτυπητο δεκαρακι
μετα αχισε να πεφτει λιγο.Ο λογος οτι καταφερα σχετικα ανετα να φτιαχτω οικονομικα και να κανω οτι κινηση θελω.
Δεν εχια καμια δυσκολια στο να φτιαξω develompent τα καλυτερα πλοια και την ισχυροτερη τεχνολογια και αυτο δεν συμπληρωθηκε απο καποια μαχη.
εβγαλα γυρω στους 50 ποντους και θα μπορουσα ανετα να ειχα αλλους 20.οποτε αυτο με εβαλε σε σκεψεις.
παντως το παιχνιδι το θεωρω πολυ καλο και αν και δεν του βαζω ακομη βαθμολογια γιατι θελω να το ξαναπαξω για να το κρινω παιρνει κατελαχιστο ενα 8αρι

εξαιρετικη συγκριση αναμεσα στα 3

Feels more fun than Eclipse (less a euro feel), however it seems to be a more area control game than a 4x type of game.

I didn't want to buy the first edition, however I traded for the second edition.

Nothing here that you have not seen before in other 4X  games, but it plays alright.  It's a bit boring that each player does not get to play a unique race, but rather just a color.  The politics card are not very political, mostly just extra resources, upgrades, or discounts.  Starts slow, but gets interesting on the last couple of turns.

RATING: 4
Unsure about this. The key problem for me is that I couldn't see how each player could easily differentiate themselves from the other players. Yes, you can take a different approach but there are too many balancing mechanisms to drag you back to the pack. (one gripe about the otherwise excellent production - the card backs are not clear enough to see when they are in someone elses hand and this is an important piece of information)

RATING: 6
Somewhat disappointing.  well-made game, but the actual play was not what I had hoped for.  The game is almost completely tactical, as you don't have enough cards in hand to make long-term plans, and the board state changes so much each time around the table that anything you plan might not work out anyway.  One player said it felt like the game was playing him.

Although I find this theme facinating and the other games by this designer a joy, this one just fails to hit interesting heights for me. I tend to agree with other comments: this is action card game and it's the *cards* that fail to interest me. They just aren't interesting and don't feel thematic at all. The area control of votes is also rather disappointing and feels too simplistic. It just doesn't have the hum of Twilight and 1960. Sold it.

RATING: 5
A quite traditional card driven game in which players play cards from their hand to add influence on the board which is scored four times during the game. Between each scoring the board is reset. Some areas on the board grant victory points while some give you tokens for the majority scoring at the end of the game. Thus you are balancing between immediate gain and the long term race for the majorities. Founding Fathers is mostly a game about choosing your battles. You simply cannot emerge victorious on every front.
 
Card play is not completely free since each card represents a state and has a political bias which limits where they can be played. This means that luck of draw limits your options and you do not have full control over your fate. Cards can also be played as events, but most of the time the usefulness of the events is very situational. This is good because the events will not be dominating the play, but at the same time there are fewer unexpected twists in the game.
 
Personally I find the game somewhat ok, although a bit one dimensional and monotonous. Events allow for some surprise moves but most of the time you can more or less anticipate what everyone is doing, provided they have the cards. That is you need to get the right cards, because if you do not, there is absolutely nothing you can do. This can be quite frustrating since you have to do what you can, not what you want. This is also evident every time the game stalls because either the players cannot, or do not want to end the round when in losing position.

Great game to bring out every Fourth of July. Founding fathers is a pretty unique and fun game where you re-enact the early USA government as it is forging the constitution. You represent different politicians in the government trying to vote of and pass pieces of the constitution. There are four factions and you want to make sure yours have the most influence on the future nation. the game is unique, has historical flavor and components, and even a little educational. Good times.

I didn't get in to this game at all, don’t mind the theme of american politics but it just felt too take that, works okay in a zero sum 2 player environment (not well I may add but better) but with more than 2 players it just becomes chaotic. Like Twilight struggle you probably need to know the deck well to really get under the system but after playing it and having several of my turns immediately reversed by just one player with one card (and also having my position worsened by other players). I don't see the point at all, awful game.

This is one of my 5 favorite Euros.  It's because of the ultra-thin "theme".  I like this time period, so the cards are really interesting.  Even though this is not the way you create a constitution, it's still a fun game.

If you threw in a few cyborg delegates that could destroy other delegates with the circular saw attached to their arms, that would be way cooler.  Add a dinosaur or two and this would probably be a 10, but take it for what it is: one of the better Euros out there.

I don't think it was quite as exciting as [b]1960[/b] or [b]2008[/b].  This was quite volatile, and it seems like you really have to know the cards and their abilities more than the other two games.  Also, you have to really be observing the card backs of the other players to do well, and frankly, they just aren't that easy to see the info on.  Decent game, just don't know how often it will get to the table.

Update: Traded away.

A basic Eurogame that uses mechanics that works well with the story. Making this game a very thematic experience indeed.

From this basic game, one could understand the situation that was presented to delegates and politicians of their time.

A very simple but yet challenging game, especially so if 5 players are at it.

An excellent game. Simple, fast, challenging and down to the wire.

I found the old Chaosium game Credo engaging in the way alternative sections of Biblical text were fought over as the game progressed.  It really felt as though we were debating the scriptures.  I hoped that Founding Fathers might give me a similar feel for the American Constitution - and build a better game around it.  While it is a better game, I was disappointed by how abstract Founding Fathers felt.  We found that the articles never came to life beyond the symbols on them.  What's more, the leading characters that the players represent have no character at all. 

Founding Fathers is a very straightforward game in which points are scored for being on the winning side of debates in the assembly and in the committee room, and 
for devoting the most energy to speeches on each of the four issues. Each of its four rounds is pretty much the same as the last. Options in a turn are limited by a hand of just three cards. At least that keeps the game moving along at a brisk pace.  Ultimately, Founding Fathers is just an OK game.

I found the card artwork quite nice.  We had no problems with differentiating the colours.  Production quality is pretty good.

I can't recommend this game highly enough.  The Constitutional Convention ca. 1776.  An excellent history lesson without being dry and bland, as history can sometimes be when not presented properly.

A well themed game whose art and flavor text really add to the overall experience.  The game plays quickly and may be at its most strategic and best with three players.  Might have some king-making problems, but players really seldom know who to try to stall/ go after due to how end game debate bonuses go.  Overall a great card driven game whose 'imbalanced' cards have yet to turn me off (as run-away leaders who take advantage of 'broken' cards are remedied through a little 'leader-bashing').  Comes with a rulebook full of added historical info, but is unfortunately lacking in F.A.Q/ rules clarification on some of the cards and card interactions.  Still, a great game which plays fast for a game of its depth and may eventually clock in at the hour mark as my group get more experienced (vanilla/ basic Catan used to go 60-90 minutes for us but has since dropped to 30-45 minutes with repeated plays).  And as stressed in the beginning, the art is tremendous in helping to streamline the game, while retaining the flavor of its theme.

Going a bit back on memory, which isn't necessarily fair in comments but I'm confident in my rating itself.  Components: found the cardstock flimsy, and most of the stuff pretty-yet-dark-and-indistinguishable with a kind of sameyness (reminds me of Endeavor?).  I love the idea of founding father type themes, but found this one sterile in practice with similar and unevoking cards, and little happening on the board.  I could see it possibly being a 5 if it were much shorter, but our play length seemed a game standard rather than an AP thing.

New cards available ~Feb-2012.

The historical aspects of the this game make it quite interesting.  The mechanics of the game at times can feel a bit forced, like trying to force history into a game format.  That is likely partial the case.  Still, in the end the game is an enjoyable experience.  The game's length is quite well balanced for the play experience.  The game always plays faster than expected.  This is especially true once the cards are known.  The card play is of course key to the play.  Unlike many card driven games there are not so many cards that getting to know them all is difficult.  In a single game, it is likely to see some of the same cards 2 or 3 times.  This really helps accelerate the learning curve.  Overall a nice game and historically quite interesting.

Deceptively simple. The structure and choices of the game are sometimes a bit too thin. It is often difficult to create a viable long-term strategic goal (short term tactics seem to win the day) which hurts the overall rating for me. Interesting game, interesting mechanics, and pretty easy to teach, but sometimes it's a bit too simple for the time invested.

While I understand that for most people in the US the theme works great, it just isn't as interesting for those of us outside the US. The fact that the game is a rather "meh" experience, where luck of the draw plays a huge part (as there just simple aren't enough cards to be played to balance things out) just pulls this game's rating down for me.

That, and the fact that it really feels light (even if it really isn't), yet it's rather long to play. I really don't like long, light games.

Apart from the theme this almost seems like the perfect game for me. It has the right mix of strategy and tactics. It has found the perfect balance between luck and influence. It is just awesome. Initially the game was on my radar but it dropped of because it was not readily available in Europe and the theme did not really strike a chord with me. But when it came available for online play at Yucata I played a game and was amazed how much I liked it. I had my own copy the next week. This multiplayer card driven game is pretty streamlined and everybody should be able to pick up the rules very quickly. Players who have played it more and have a better knowledge of the available cards do have an advantage. But this is not so big new players will be without a chance to win. The game has a big take that factor and people who don't like that should definitely stay away. But if you're looking for a solid multiplayer card driven game of low complexity, look no further.

This game was a delight to play. I loved the different ways you could use every card, and the different methods of scoring victory points. It gives you so much to think about, but when you really get down to it the mechanisms aren't difficult at all. Another nice thing about the game is that you work your way through the deck rather quickly, so you start to get some familiarity with what is available. I hope I can convince my family to play it again, because I really liked the game, and thought about it a lot afterwards. It's strange, because I was never a fan of history, but there's just something about these games that are based on real events which gets me interested (even to the point where I'm thinking of reading some books on the subject.)

I liked playing it, but I'm afraid that when you get really deep into the game, card-counting ends up being a huge advantage. In Twilight Struggle, you sort of end up doing it naturally (you don't even realize you're keeping track of dozens of cards, you just do), but with this one I imagine the effort would have to be deliberate, and thus, less interesting a game to dive deep into.

RATING: 5.5
A low-scoring, card-driven game that feels like tug-of-war.  I like that it has multi-purpose cards and that you always know something about your opponents' cards (i.e., the state and faction).  Many of the cards have powerful abilities that can undermine things that your opponents have done so it's important to grab guaranteed points whenever you have the chance.  There is a good amount of tension, especially as players get familiar with (memorize) the cards and frequently scan the table to see which state cards their opponents are holding.

**UPDATE 2011: I don't hate this game, but I don't think highly of it.  It's a very tactical game that tends to reward experienced players who know (memorize) the cards.  For example, Ben Franklin is an awesome card (possibly overpowered), and it's found on a Pennsylvania card with a big star (there are 3 of these)... but if a big-star-PA card is out on display, you have a 33% chance of getting an awesome card.  There are a lot of points available from faction tokens at the end... I'm not fond of this because it can really swing the game, but I guess it adds another path to victory and provides a necessary catch-up mechanism so players are not totally down-and-out if they aren't scoring elsewhere.

I enjoyed this more than I was expecting. It probably gets at least a one or two rating point bump because it seems to have many of the same decision points as the magnificent "Twilight Struggle." The theme integrates very well in some places (voting on the articles) and less so in others (the Debate Track). I did find from time to time that I let myself slip into numbery, gamey, victory point calculating without that calculation being informed by the theme (we never had an awareness of the specific articles being addressed, for example). There was a lot of me leaning over the board to look closely at which state cards were available (probably an easy way to mod this). Still, it's a very engaging multiplayer game with a very cool historical reference point; it is sound mechanically and thematically with many interesting (this or this?) decisions. It plays in only 90 minutes. Not too many games can advertise all of these qualities together and I look to include it in my collection when it is again in print.

The group I play with, which includes three history lovers, was very disappointed in this game.  It takes way too long for what it is - a simple influence card game (albeit multi-layered).  Your hand of cards is too small and the cards too varied (12 States (suits) + 4 factions) for you to mount any decisive or cohesive strategy.  Thus, the game is mostly easy, bland decisions with some turns a complete waste.  Founding Bothers.

My first play of Founding Fathers was with five players and it was very underwhelming. Too many things could happen between turns and some players could easily be left out. Fortunately, years later I tried it with three players on Yucata.de and discovered the little gem I had hoped for. I just love how each move counts, as you can't be sure how much longer the round will last.

I'm a fan of U.S. history, so I really like the theme and the general execution of this game.   

The hand limit does seem a little restrictive though, and it seems very important to get lucky and draw cards with the same same state or symbol on them.  If other players are doing that and you get unlucky it seems possible to fall behind.    The George Washington card is also very powerful, and one player drawing that twice in a game is probably a game breaker.  

Haven't played it enough to truly work out different strategies, so this rating is very tentative.

I enjoy the theme and really love the historical flavor of the cards and artwork. The game is also actually pretty fun to play, if a little long for what it is. The fact that this is 3+ players is unfortunate, as I'd love to play this with my husband. Some of the cards are also really powerful, and can make for some crazy swingy turns (I suppose this imbalance is why the game requires 3+?). For these reasons, and because we have several better area control games in our collection, this didn't make the cut. Sold.

Picked this up at Origins 2010.  It's a very thematic game, I love the integration of the theme with the mechanics and really enjoyed the game play as well.  The components are of good quality, but I could see after two games that the cards weren't that great, and were going to take a beating, so I sleeved them.  Otherwise, I would avoid playing with 5, as it just seems way too chaotic.  I think the sweet spot is at 4 players.

RATING: 5
This game is kind of an odd duck.  While I like what they tried to do here, I just didn't care for the execution all that much.  I think my main beef with the game is the swinginess of the special abilities of many of the cards, which make it nearly impossible to carry out any sort of planning, since anything you do could potentially be completely undone with the play of a card.  Heck, sometimes cards undo several other players' turns!

Overall, I feel like they were trying to make a serious game here, but then filled it with take-that card play that seems completely disjointed with the game to me.

In the end, I didn't think it was terrible, but I felt like the game boiled down to a crapshoot instead of the more gamery game I was expecting.  Perhaps it's just a case of false expectations, but I just didn't care for it much in the end.

Played at LobsterTrap 14.

My first game of the event was Founding Fathers, a new-to-me games whose lukewarm reception among Geekbuddies last year bumped it far enough down my want-to-play list that I never got around to giving it a try. The game is reasonably good, which is not surprising given the designers' pedigree, but I actually found the historical flavor more appealling than the mechanics. The production from Jolly Roger is quite good, if a bit short of top notch (and marred by some questionable color choices). But the experience was both more engaging and engrossing than I had expected going in. I think it is roughly in the same class as 1960: The Making of the President -- perhaps a half-notch below a [BGCOLOR=#9999FF][b][COLOR=#9999FF]_[/COLOR]6[COLOR=#9999FF]_[/COLOR][/b][/BGCOLOR].

It has cool mechanics, but like TS and 1960 it is dryer than a game with such a cool theme should be. It also doesn't feel quite right historically; there should be more negotiation. Cards might be unbalanced. I do like the integration of historical material and flavor text, which gives a little bit less of a cube-pusher feel. It's not really about formulating long-term plans for card play and stuff so much as creating short-term risk-management options--that usual sort of minmaxing thing that I don't much enjoy. An admirable design, but finally just too dry an athematic for me.

Anytime a group of either four or five of us get together, this one (unsurprisingly) makes it to the table.  This is one of my top games, as it mixes US History, the US Constitution (the greatest document ever written), and excellent boardgame mechanics.

There is quite a bit of shuffling, planning, outmaneuvering, outsmarting, cajoling, and overall player interaction that makes this one of my all-time favorites.  I must try to play this more often.

Wow -- fun, strategic (and historically informational) game.  I'd been wanting to get this to the table for a while, as I love 1960 (same designers).  But unlike 1960, this is a [b]multi[/b]-player card-drive game.  Played a 3-player game, and we all immediately liked it very early on in the game.  And all immediately wanted to play a 2nd game after the first.  Excellent components, rules, and game play.  And the game plays quickly once you know the rules.  Highly recommended.  An instant hit for us.

I guess its a solid design, but something about the game felt kind of 'blah' to me. I think the theme is interesting, but it ended up feeling fairly abstract to me.  In other words, the issues we were trying to manipulate into the constitution could have been anything.

I'm not that interested in playing further, but I could be talked into it. Some respected Geekbuddies really like it...so maybe I missed something, but I think ultimately its just not my thing.

Love it! Great game! It captures the feel of the constitution convention and does it in an elegant manner. There is a lot more depth to the game than seems to be initially. There is also a lot of tension coming down the wire on the votes and the end scoring. Most games I've played have been very, very close--one 4-player game, in fact, ended in a 3-way tie for first! :)

Only online plays, but often feels like the first round and the cards you draw dictate the rest of the game. Either playing to eek out the lead, or playing catch up. And in either case, you're biding time waiting for the right card.

Some cards feel overpowered as well - as in 'Remove X influence' or 'Flip an article.' The play space seems too narrow for real strategic depth.

Perhaps the theme is stronger in person - would love to get some f2f time in.

I really wanted to love this game.  I think the theme is interesting, and it seems like it's going to be a lot of fun to play as well.  But after several plays I just think it's missing the "fun" element.

The idea is to take cards from your hand which represent representatives at the drafting of the Constitution and play them to your advantage.  You might declare a vote on the current article for that man's state (yay or nay), speak in debate on 1 of 4 topics, or execute a specific action listed on the card.  Points are earned if you voted on the right side, while debate tokens earn you points at the end for each article that has the same bias (Federalist, Big States, etc.).

What I've found is that I can't really tell why I'm doing well or poorly in this game.  It feels a bit too random, and some cards are just far too powerful (one card, for example, prevents all events from being played for that round, eliminating 1/3 of gameplay).  I do wonder if the experience face-to-face may be improved, as you'd have more opportunity to really track what your opponents are up to.

On the plus side, the historical background listed on the cards is a nice touch, so this could be a good asset for teaching Revolution-era history.

I really like this game. There's all sorts of historical stuff on the cards and in the rulebook, but the game is not really about the historical stuff. When I play, I don't read the articles we're voting on. I just read the faction. I suppose you could role play it up, but I like the game for the simultaneous fights that are going on. You have to choose your fights (just like raising kids.)
The history is an added bonus, but it doesn't really affect play.

This was an auto-buy for me.  Games rooted in history that actually attempt to incorporate the theme in a meaningful way hook me at first sight.  Now if only I could get some serious gamers to sit down and play it with me...

After getting a few games in recently, I can see why it's not a blockbuster game.  But, since I really enjoy the theme and the mechanics of this game, I will probably always be willing to play it.  So far, I've lost every game I've played, but I want more.

The board's design and function are amazing. The bits of history on the cards and in the game are great. Overall it is great fun and good strategy. The game oozes its theme - a theme that makes sense and both supports and is supported by the game and its mechanics.
Then again I'm a history buff. On the other hand, my non-historian friends also really enjoyed it more than I anticipated.

I've found Founding Fathers to be an excellent game that mixes traditional euro-game elements with card driven mechanics. Each card can serve any one of three functions, or it can be played for its event. The upshot is that formulating a strategy is easy, but actually carrying it through is difficult because you cannot anticipate which actions or events will be played by your opponents.

The end result is a rare mix of simple mechanics with great depth, and the game has good history to boot. Thumbs up.

Really fun game.  There is some luck to the card draws, but if you know what you are doing you can mitigate a lot of it.  I like the riskiness of holding out for one more draw so you can try to pull off a big scoring play.  The theme is a turn off to many, and it shouldn't be, this is a light Euro in 1778 clothing.

After 1 play, not sure whether to rate a 7 or 6.  I like the game, but there is a lot of randomness to it.  The card draw is really important in this game...whether you are competing in debates or wanting to get a state which hasn't voted.  There are several events which are of the "take that" variety...laying waste to your best laid plans.

Still, I want to like it because of the theme and ultimately that's why I'm going with a 7.  The theme really could have been about anything, but the production quality and the flavor of the Continental Congress shines through.

RATING: 4
Players represent delegates at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, trying to hammer the US Constitution into a finished document.  Players on their turn play their mini hand of cards in one of four ways - discard, meld symbols, meld colours or play the event for some special action.  The cards represent the delegates, the colours represent the states they originate from, and the symbols represent one of the four political bias they stand four.  Melding colours go to the Assembly Room, where an article is being resolved, which will eventually fill up with a majority of Yes or No votes.  That ends a round where points are awarded, and bonus chips handed out.  Repeat three more times with an end of game bonus paid out for melding symbols during the game.  Pretty simple game - play, meld, score stuff, dressed up in glorious artwork and dressy terms such as "Speak in Debate", "Declare a Vote", "Snub", etc, as well as a rulebook that is around 40% rules and 60% history lesson.  I tried like it, but it felt too long and too chaotic - really not sure how much control you have over your destiny in this one, and the mini-hand of three cards gives you little long term strategy.  A player's turn is reduced to tactical opportunism at the instant their turn arrives.  Cards look wonderful, but the colouring (states) is very dim and hard to distinguish, and the card stock is very thin - straight into sleeves as you will be shuffling often.  Quickly sold on.  I think we need "the Gupta Guy" (q. Messy Games Room) back on the team.

As a multiplayer CDG, this works pretty well.  Thematically, it is very original, and it works on that level as well.   As with any CDG, learning the events on the cards is necessary to really come to grips with the game.  The other core mechanics here are quite simple.  Cards have two "suits":  a state, and a faction.   And like other games in this family, choosing between the state/faction or the event is the primary tension in the game.   Winning elections and matching faction symbols seems to be the best way to get points, but doing in well in the debates can earn a good chunk of points as well.   It's a solid game, no doubt.   Some complaints, however.  (1)   The cards are very dark, the colors indistinguishable, and the text and icons very small.   And they are thin.   The rest of the game has a good look to it, but the cards are disappointing.  And, (2)  the price!  At $65 retail, or $45 online, it's way, way, way overpriced in my opinion.

This is a good game when I am in the mood for it. The mechanics of the area control are very sound. But the voting outcome can be dictated a little bit too much on the luck of the draw.

This is no 1960 or Twilight Struggle.  It's something very different.  First, it's shorter and easier than both of those games.  Second, it plays more than two.   Third, although it is a historical subject and flavor text abounds, it just doesn't have the thematic feel of the previous games. Players never bother to read the articles up for a vote (rather like modern politicians) because it just isn't necessary.  What matters is scoring victory points by winning votes (akin to area majority) and dominating debates (akin to bidding).

I hate to say it, but this is really a Euro in a powdered wig.  I still like it, but I had hoped for more.

RATING: 6
As I live a 10 minute walk from Independence Hall and have an affinity for the subject matter, I was hoping for something special here, but I think my hopes were too high. While I didn't expect another Twilight Struggle, I had expected a game with some of the intricacies and thematically integrated game play since this is by one of the designers. Instead, I was surprised, quite frankly, at how abstract and simple this game is. The articles were reduced to just symbols you tried to match. Speaking in debate was just a symbol matching game. Playing events and personages had little, if any, thematic integration into what was going on. You only ever manage 3 cards at a time. I'm fairly sure the game could be completely re-themed without losing anything.

Thematic fail out of the way then, how is the game? Not bad, though it never caught any traction with my group due to the inability to plan. You don't have a hand of 7 or 8 cards a la TS but rather live turn to turn with a hand of 3 cards. Makes planning exclusively a tactical affair, and the challenge comes in how well you’re able to react to the situation at hand by the time the turn comes around to you again. More than likely, things look a good bit different than they did on your last turn.  Seems you can combo some nice events (if you get them), and in theory it would help to know the deck effects, e.g., knowing which events are on which states’ cards but nobody is going to do that.

3/23/10  Read the rules for Founding Fathers. It just moved way up on my wishlist.

5/18/10  I definitely want to play Campaign Manager again without the preconstructed decks and I'm looking forward to Founding Fathers even more now.

8/17/10  Game night started with a 3-player game of Founding Fathers. One player got sick and we had to quit, but I was liking the game.

9/21/10  I really like Founding Fathers. A large Big-State delegation from Pennsylvania got me a big lead, then George Washington shut everyone down.

11/16/10  Next up was Founding Fathers. I really like this game.  Our game ended with all 4 factions being represented by 3 articles. Weird.

A shorter, less-tense, but moreclaustrophobic experience than TS. 
This being said, the cards are marvelously well-themed. The hand of three cards is remniscent of Liberté, as is the fact that players do not play to further any one political philosophy in the game, but rather whichever one is to their advantage at the time.  
Cards are multi-use, like many CDGs, but their use becomes more and more restricted as the round proceeds.  Though nicely themed, these cards can be quite a bit more situational and thus difficult to play.  I can see cardplay becoming easier with more experience, though I'm afraid the learning-curve will make this difficult to introduce to a casual 3rd player, much less 4-5.  Especially interested in playing it w/ 4!

2-player variant works, but is quite fragile; poorly-considered play can potentially drain the round of all energy while severely constricting progress until the right cards are finally drawn and used.  2P not recommended as a first-time play, but rather only later when more experienced.

Founding Fathers is my favorite game of 2010 for three primary reasons: 1. Theme; 2.Game Play; and 3) Value.

1. Theme. The theme is richly expressed through the game play and the various game elements.   The historical notes are surprisingly interesting and come through as you are making game decisions.  Sure, your personal political point of view doesn’t matter, but the politics of the game are fun and interesting.
2. Game Play. The game is fun to play and quite different from the recent spate of worker placement games.   The Cards have multiple uses and allow a flexible strategy depending on events and strategies employed by other players.  Though the theme is unusual, it’s strong basis in history allows this game to serve as a gateway game to bring in non-gamers to give it a try.  Everyone who has played this game with me thoroughly enjoyed it.
3. Value. 	The components are very well made and easy to use.  The wooden bits and high quality cards hold up to repeated play and are fun to look at.  This game is heavy and after using the components in a game you really feel like you get your money’s worth.    A great value.

Rating for this could go up considerably, but it wasn't great as a 5 player game.  Hard to plan for your next turn when 4 others will go before your next turn.  Too much counting near the end game (and I was the one doing the counting).  The cards have plenty of flavor text, but the actual game mechanics didn't really capture the theme.  It didn't feel like we were developing any sort of Constitution.  Just felt like any other VP machine.

Another wonderful Matthews and Leonhard American history game.  The production is lush (minus a few typos here and there) with always fantastic Josh Cappel artwork.  The mechanics are clearly theme driven.  The game is pretty simple rules-wise, but the interaction between the plays is subtle and quite interesting.  Plenty of player interaction here - definitely not multiplayer solitaire.  The game feels a bit fragile at times, meaning that some odd play could really break the game.  It is a good game, obviously nowhere near as good as Twilight Struggle, but I think there is much to explore here and I look forward to future plays.

I liked the game, but your hand cycles so quickly that it's hard to make any long-range plans or set up any clever plays.  The most interesting decision each turn was not what to do with my action, but rather, deciding which cards I wanted in my hand for the following turn.

Not all cards are created equal, that's life. However, the gross imbalance of some of these has become apparent and is extremely annoying and disappointing.

Such a shame as I really enjoyed this before the issues became abused. It would be nice to have a cdg that was multiplayer and playable in 60 to 90 minutes. Sigh.

This is ultimately a decent game that just falls apart under a few key stresses.  
1) The Unbearable Heat event is annoying and very difficult to play.  It can cause complete breakdown in the game dynamics.
2) Constitutional Articles are too few and very linear.  There should at very least be more articles, some of which are removed from play before the game starts.  This would keep up some unknown dynamics between the debate floor and the players.
3) Not enough historical flavor.  Some of the events are thematically great (Washington), but most are just shoe-horned in.

Nice political card game.

Probably would play better as an asynchronous online or email game, because it is difficult to read the various cards that players are holding (dark print on dark colors) and slows the game down when playing in person.
Still would certainly play again in person.

A few days after playing this game, I posted this in our guild: "So, a few of us played the other night and felt lack luster about it.

but, now days later I'm thinking more and more about it.

Is it that being a Jason Mathews title we were expecting a deeper feel from the game and found it too light? We like other lighter titles.

Was it that I made the cardinal sin of trying to introduce (and me teach it) a new game at midnight?

Is there more there? I'm thinking I'm digging it for a light quick game.

or is it just my love of area majority games that makes me want to like this game? "

I really want to like this game.  There have been plenty of 'meh' games we've played. It's not like anyone really dislikes them, but then they sit on the shelf for years.

Yet this game pretty much got a 'meh' from the table, but I'm really wanting to play it again.

RATING: 5
I liked the idea of this game much better than the actual game.  

Additionally (and this isn't a slight quibble): his game HATES non-English reading, colorblind, and/or slightly vision-impaired people. The color palette is very murky and dark card colors all blend together, with card text/state names hidden in the color scheme.  

The card backs exhibit extreme sameness. Even the special portrait cards of the starting players, in B&W, were far too generic without close inspection.  

Add to that the fact that the state's names are perpetually and unavoidably obscured by wooden block influence tokens placed on them per the rules, atop a shiny board and with shiny cards prone to light glare.  

Because of low visibility, too much time was spent each turn narrating which cards/states were in the draw pool, in the assembly floor, and even in each others' hands (the common knowledge element of the game). And if players have not played before, the added learning curve and game running of assimilating all the info on the cards increases.

I'm glad I played it, but it was very very dry despite it's well-researched theme. Mechanics amounted to shuffling around cards on the board.  

Random card draws and special power cards don't allow for much choice, and even with cards having multi-uses left a lot of hollow gameplay. 

Gets very fiddly, especially at the endgame; midway through our final round 1st through 4th place was predetermined regardless of how it shook out, but came to an AP-induced grinding halt while 1st and 2nd place ran the numbers to come up with the smallest delta between final scores.

About the design: the "Yea" "Nay" counters upkeep was a relentless chore (a tally-board with plastic sliders would have been better, even if at add'l cost).   

I might play again with history buffs, but this game is less gateway than I think some users are giving it credit for.

Very tactical game, where you must take points where you can, and also keep on mind the card abilities and possibilities to invest on debates (for end-of-game victory point potential).

Hard to play any certain strategy as this is more of an moment-to-moment tactical game, and also 'diplomatic' issues and uneven card luck will influence the result of the game. But if you like appreciate the theme and don't mind some luck, diplomacy and tactical nature of the game, you will probably enjoy it.

The amount of victory points you accumulate during the game is not huge (maybe 15-30 range) and variance of scores is not high, hence the possibility of multiple winners (or other positions) is quite high.

Great game of balance.  Take your points when then come.  Even the single points are worth more now than a possible 2 points later.  The end scoring is not as important if the game is balanced.

RATING: 5
Real disappointment here. After 1960 and Campaign 08, my expectations were high, but this just falls short in so many ways. It's basically just a worker placement game, and a mediocre one at that. It's got a lot of great historical flavor, but that doesn't save this from being a slightly awkward and boring game. For example, there are 4 different factions that you vote on, producing 4 different types of articles. In my first game, we only had two different types to begin with, and most players stuck with just those two types, making the game even more shallow. Those that invested heavily in the big 2 did well, everyone who attempted to strike out on their own did not. Is it a fluke? Maybe, but to me it seems like a fluke that is part of the nature of the game--that is, it seems like it could very commonly lead to situations like this where viable choices are effectively halved.

Though the production looks very good, the colors for states needed to be a lot more distinct and brighter, with the state written LARGE and in high contrast so you can see it easily, even from across the table.

I was hoping for more political action out of this one.  The theme is thinly veiled behind the game mechanics.  Having a hand limit of three seems to make choices a little less eventful.  The randomness of the event cards can be a little discouraging, as a win can come down to who had the right card at the right time and not necessarily strategy.

Still a fun game, and the voting and debate floor can be interesting.  Gameplay flows really well.  There's just something missing here for me that I can't justify a higher rating.  I really enjoyed my play, but something about the cards and how they're handled seems a bit off.

True to other reviews, I found this to be a beautiful, slightly thematically off target, but close faught game which seems quite enjoyable, if not quite as engaging as trying to save/take over the world from the Reds/Capitalists while avoiding a nuclear wasteland.

Rating initially as a 7 - Good, but not yet deserving of Great, based on one solo play. A solid entertaining game, but one that could have been still more, perhaps.

After 5 plays I'd say this is a solid Euro-style game.  The play is engaging, and interactive, and the art is all that could be asked for- especially with the Replacement Deck of cards on more durable stock.

It's not a world-beater, but a solid game, and fun when you pull it out. I prefer the games with 3, 4, & 5 - the more the merrier. (Though folks will get left behind in the pack, I've also seen some epic come-from-behind scoring with endgame faction points.)

I enjoyed this one.  It's really a card game at heart, with several different options possible for each card.  There are many games that meet that description, but there are a couple things I really like about Founding Fathers: 1) This is a brilliant theme. Love it. 2) Since the state and affiliation of each card is visible from the back, it's possible to make informed decisions about what to do, and 3) the different parts of the board are fairly balanced, so that if one person is beating everyone in votes, it's still possible for others to come back in the debates.  Good stuff. (1 play)

RATING: 2.5
Too long for what it is, which is a game with a high degree of chaos where long-term strategy is not a viable thing; the small hand size and limited options on any given turn (often made even more limited by the *wildly* powerful events) restrict players to simply taking the most tactically viable option at any given time; turns come down to sheer opportunism.  I love long games.  I love light games.  But ((Long AND Light) == Teh Suck).


Card backs are *horrible*:  in order to even attempt to utilize the mostly-non-existent strategies that are available, you need to pay attention to what cards are in the draw pile and what people have.  The dark and very similar card-back design makes it impossible to tell what state a delegate is from unless you get within 8 inches of the card, which slows things down considerably, especially if you want to know what other players have.


And don't get me started on the Committee room:  people lost the vote, so as a consolation prize they get to pass the next bill?  Really?  Is that how shit went down?


My complaints, in short:  extremely limited hands combined with events that are wildly variable in terms of game effect, and other events that turn the certain rounds into an endurance test and luck-fest make this a game that is completely lacking in anything meaty.  And at two hours (or more!), that's too long for something so trite.  I suspect you *might* be able to get it down to 90 minutes if you played quickly, but even that is too long for what it is.  Too many cards can cause wild point-swings, flipping everybody to the opposite side, for instance, or replacing an influence marker:  either can easily cause a 6 to 10-point swing in scores, removing several points from one player and awarding them to someone else.  That's WAY too big a swing for a game where winning scores are often under 30, and luck of the draw plays way too big of a role here.  This sin is compounded by the long playing time.

It's like they took the good stuff from Ticket to Ride, the good stuff from every influence-peddling euro ever made, the good stuff from CDGs and distilled out the worst of each of those and made a game.

So, here's what we have:

1)  A game that exhibits a high degree of luck, makes long-term planning rather unviable, and takes 2+ hours.  As a game, it fails the biggest test (for me):  "is it fun?"

2)  An historic simulation that appears to bear no relation whatsoever to reality.  As a simulation, it's worthless and inaccurate, and fails spectacularly.  I think it has some MILD utility in the classroom, and that mostly because of card-text and the article text and alt-hist.

As much as I was looking forward to a 2-5 player CDG, this isn't that; rather, it has been possibly the biggest letdown in my gaming career.

I thought 1960 was a waste of my time.  And I could never bring myself to dedicate the time to Twilight Struggle.

And yet, Founding Fathers was a game I could get behind.  I didn't love it, but I would definitely play it again.  It still had the troubling "Tug of War" that all of their games feature; but it wasn't so prominent.

The historical touches were nice and plenty of thought was added.  The cards were gorgeous.  The play was interesting.  (The events on the cards added most of the interesting decisions.)

Still, nothing actually *stand out* from the design so I won't be owning it.

Mar11:
Much better the second time. Got to play with Brandon, Kayla, Sean and my wife.

I still don't need to own it, but it was acceptable. There were tradeoffs on where to play. And the way the debate tokens scored brought the different paths together.

And really, I thought the theme was at least interesting if not fun. Probably the best CDG style I've played, and yet still not something I like to play if that makes any sense.

Tons better than 1960 anyway. That crap was just tug-of-war. This had strategy to it.

gameplay is slow, and a little more random than previous matthews/leonard games. the various mechanics really boil down to faction identification, but everything else is so steeped in historical information that it still feels very thematic. i love the events that relate to a historical person's influence on the convention- example, the callow youth in debate, or the delegate fallen ill events. really looking forward to more plays.

There's a heavy area control component to the debates, which doesn't surprise much, but the way the proposals are enacted is interesting.  After a time it seems clear which way the voting will go and it's a matter of maximizing one's own benefit and minimizing that of others.  It's a skill not explicitly tested in games that much that I can remember; not so much reading individual opponents as reading the group dynamic.  (Implicitly this skill is tested all over the place, but FF really calls it out.)

As always with a Jason Matthews game, FF makes a real effort to evoke the theme.  It's partially successful; while it's fun to watch the debates play out, the consensus at our table was that they wished the characters had more of an agenda with respect to federalism and big/small state considerations beyond being remembered to history as "Father of the Constitution."

I'm not sure where I'll fall on this game but I enjoyed my first play quite a bit.

Some nice things going on here. There are trace elements of the designers' earlier card driven political games (Twilight Struggle, 1960) in that the cards have multiple uses of which you can only choose 1, and that you are trying to create majority scores that favour you in different areas. hiowever, that's as close as the similarities get, this is multiplayer, simpler and a lot quicker to play.

Some rounds play quickly if the players focus on voting, others go more slowly if they concentrate on playing cards for events or on the faction ladder in the debate hall.

Very nice artwork and different from the crowd - I like it.

RATING: 6.5
FF is an enjoyable, if not terrifically innovative, card-based area control game. Each turn presents several options, all of which usually can be worthwhile and are often roughly equivalent in apparent value. Thus, the game offers lots of scope for tough decisions. The mechanisms work individually and mesh well together, producing a pretty rewarding gaming experience.

Having said that, I ultimately am disappointed in two aspects of the game that prevent me from rating it higher. The theme, which is what lured me to the game initially, is disappointingly incidental to the gameplay. Players have no ideological orientation and no intrinsic attachment or opposition to any of the articles they are voting on. It's quite common to support a Federalist article one turn and an Anti-Federalist one the next, or vice-versa, depending upon the cards in your hand at the time.  

That produces the second disappointment - the game becomes overly tactical. It centers on scoring as many points as possible in the current turn with the limited cards in your hand and churning cards that aren't helpful to you in hopes of drawing better ones. Only in the debates are you building a long-term position, and attentive group play should prevent anyone from gaining a significant advantage on the debate track. 

I'd play FF again if asked, because it worked pretty well as a 4-player tactical game, and I suspect it also would work pretty well with 5. For that I'd give FF a 6.5. Had it delivered more long-term strategy tied to its theme, my rating would be considerably higher.

Solid game, probably my favorite from the crop of 2010 releases which included several very good games, no great ones, and many overrated ones that left me disappointed.  Founding Fathers, which I had pre-ordered six months before it came out, did not disappoint.  Full of historical flavor, multiple paths to victory, fairly simple mechanics and a game that plays to completion in about an hour and a half.  What's not to like?

Additional comment:  Can't understand the low ratings compared to 2-player games by the same design team.  Think 1960 and Campaign Manager 2008 leave alot to be desired compared to this game, which is far superior.  (Still think Twilight Struggle deserves to be up there, however.)

RATING: 9.2
One of the better thematic/mechanism integrations I've played, which makes it a lot of fun to experience as a game.  Also one of the best "educational" games I've played, as not only is it historically accurate and delves lovingly into the details of the founding, but it's got a meaty, interesting game design as well.

I enjoyed this game so much, this is the game that inspired me to join Yucata.de and promptly jump into 4 simultaneous games of it!

Game design has a nice mix of short-term gain vs. long-term investment.  I also like how each round has a "mini-arc" as things crescendo to states getting locked out, a yay vs nay dynamic develops, the debates heat up, etc, then things reset all over again.  Once states start getting locked out, the debates and the events mean there is still plenty to do with the cards - brilliant design!
While there is a bit of long-term planning, it's more of a chaotic game where you have to react tactically to others' play in order to do well.

The mechanics feel very political (which is good thematically).  You are forging temporary alliances for the yay or nay of a particular bill.  On top of that, there is the incentive to be on the losing side (committee room) which gives the game a good balance.

I'm a little unsure of whether the designers meant it to be more of a quick-paced, not-too-serious light game or more of a thinky game (see game night geeklist for more).

Clearly loving attention to detail has been applied to the production; the flags on the cards, for example, and the beautiful calligraphy on the acts.
The historical angle is interesting and fascinating, as for example you get to see the "alternative" to each act.

Jason Matthews has over the past few months quickly gained my respect as a designer.  This month Founding Fathers, last month Twilight Struggle, and a few months earlier Campaign Manager 2008 (which, while relatively light and a theme-turn-off for me, is still a pretty cool election game).  Matthews' theme-mechanics integration is pretty much as good as you can get while still having a very playable, meaty strategy game.  Any more and it would have to be a simulation.  And, he makes the history come alive in a really cool way.

RATING: 7
In the wake of 1960: The Making of the President and Campaign Manager 2008, I've kept my expectations low for Founding Fathers.

It has exceeded them, but only slightly. This is actually a fairly straightforward and relatively short (60-75 minutes) game of positioning. Options on your turn are slim, but choosing when and how to side with or oppose particular proposals does capture a sense of politics. A lot of the game here is actually in the predictive value offered by your player aid - your decisions become much more interesting when you're paying close attention to the deck delegates as they come and go. Players need to track delegates in relation to their home states and their political leanings, not to mention be aware of particular events (George Washington can instantly end a round, for example).

Founding Fathers feels a bit stiff to me. On your turn you may plan an event, play a set of cards from one state to support or oppose the current article being debated, or play a set of cards of the same political bent to make a speech. You can also "snub delegates," i.e. discard bad cards and refill your hand (or "caucus" as the game calls it). With a three card hand-size, the game feels way too limited for my tastes. There just isn't much to choose from.

The thematic integration is also uneven at best. It's interesting to see speeches, backroom deal-making, political divisions, appearances from the likes of George Washington and Ben Franklin, and of course, the actual voting, but the players themselves don't (and can't) represent any concrete interest within the game. One round, you're pushing a small-states platform with delegates from Rhode Island. The next round, you're pushing a big-states platform with delegates from Virginia. Multiply that dilemma by 10 and you have some idea of the schizophrenia inherent to Founding Fathers. As a decision-making entity, you have no home within the game, and that's more than a little strange given the subject matter.

A decent game that shines with 5 players.

This is a truly mediocre game. It's as though the venerable creators of Twilight Struggle needed to boil their game down, so they made 1960; then they needed to boil it down a little more, so they made 2008; then they needed to boil it down a little more, so they did, and discovering that Matthews had boiled away the virtues of his other design concepts, he and his cronies quickly tacked a few area majority principles onto an incongruous theme and called it a day.

The graphic design is ugly photoshop hackwork. There isn't anything that's really bad here or creaky, though the Washington card might qualify.

It's just boring.

Overall this game is okay but just not my style. There are a couple things that I find really cumbersome and annoying: 1) Every single card has a different action on it. For someone with a lousy memory this is a real disadvantage when others can remember which actions go with which states and factions. Essentially my buddy can pretty much tell what the draw deck cards are even though they are flipped over while I only remember about 2 of them. 2) The colors on the cards are all muted and very difficult to differentiate. This makes it challenging to tell what your opponents have and what's already been played. I am a visual game player. It would be so much easier if you could see the colors instead of having to read the state names.

Jason Matthews has designed some of my favorite games and again he doesn’t disappoint. I love that Founding Fathers is a card driven Matthews and Leonhard game that plays more than two. I love the historical theme, and the notes in the rulebook and design of the board that compliment it. The rules are pretty simple yet there is a lot of depth to the strategy. There is a great balance of player conflict without anyone feeling like they are getting screwed, because most of the conflict is one against the rest and not everyone ganging up on someone.

I would rate Founding Fathers a solid 9 and possibly even a 9.5. I like this game more every time I play it. Founding Fathers is great for fans of US History or people that like political games.

I won this in a Games for Geekgold auction. Boy was I jazzed to win this!

It turned out to be not quite as good a game as it appeared.  It's a little TOO slavish to historical detail and thus ends up with some delegate cards being nearly useless and others being way more useful for their special abilities than being delegates to advance your agenda. Ostensibly you have the ability to craft a wildly different U.S. Constitution in the end than what we actually have... but in actual play I found no one cared about how the Constitution came out, and focused entirely on how they'd win the points they needed.  This is the game's major weakness - choices that affect "the history of the United States" have no bearing on your victory, you can literally screw over the entire history of the country in order to win.

Eventually traded it away, knowing I wouldn't want to go back to it.

Faster and easier than it looks. But... special cards might have a bit too heavy OR at least they'll make a big swing for the points in many cases. I think the biggest issue for me is the need to read the cards too much. Maybe more straighforward and less special cards and this might works for me. Now... it's playable, but needs more fun.

RATING: 9
This is a preliminary rating after only 2 plays. I'm still learning the subtleties of the game, but it gets a 9 from me already because the theme is so magnificently supported by thorough historical research and clever game mechanics.  This game simulates the 1787 US constitutional convention and does so brilliantly.  Very, very few games, especially those of the Euro genre, pay this much attention to theme and make that theme drive the game in historically accurate and interesting ways.  Some complain that the mechanics of the game would work with any theme, and that may be the case, but the designers here have gone the extra mile to use those mechanics to capture the feel of the historical convention.  They accomplish this feat largely through the use of special event effects on the delegate cards.  When played in the right context, these cards simulate the feel of the convention vividly.  

Here's an example from my second game.  One of the main ways that players gain victory points is by exerting their influence to have delegates vote in certain ways.  Influence is marked with wooden blocks that are placed on top of delegates who have have declared their votes at the instigation of the players.  Gunning Bedford, a delegate from the small state of Delaware, can be used by a player to force another player to remove influence markers from up to two state delegations which have already declared their vote and include at least one delegate from the small states faction.  In the right context this can cost a player a lot of victory points.  That's exactly what happend in our game, when Gunning Bedford was played at a time when the Roger Sherman player had invested a lot of influence into positioning several small state delegates into voting against a proposal that favored the large states.  Had he succeeded in defeating this proposal, he would have secured quite a lot of victory points.  The play of Gunning Bedford by another player, however, undid all that work in one fell swoop.  The victimized player screamed in rage and agony over this sudden turn of events.  As a result, we all wanted to know more about Gunning Bedford and why he had this game effect.  So we looked at the flavor text of the card and discoverd this: "The Convention turned hostile when Bedford suggested that small states might seek foregin alliances to protect themselves against domination by the larger states."  So here's what happend in game terms.  The Sherman player was working hard to build a coalition of small state delegates to defeat a provision that favored big states.  And he was doing a good job of it until Bedford made his ill-timed threat about small states seeking foreign alliances.  Historically, Bedford's speech outraged most of the delegates at the convention and seriously damaged the small states' position in general.  In game terms, because the Sherman player had thrown his influence behind several small state delegates, his position suffered with theirs.  This is exactly the sort of thing that happened at the historical convention, and the game mechanics simulated it brilliantly.  Moreover, the game effects were so profound that they motivated the players to find out more about the historical reality that those effects were simulating. That's a remarkable design achieivement in my book, and if repeated plays produce similar moments with regular frequency, this rating will jump to a 10. A truly unique and highly enjoyable gaming experience, especially for anyone with any interest in the history behind the game.

Felt like a solid family level multiplayer CDG which I enjoyed my first play.  Cards weren't as variable or unique as I may prefer, but still provided some space for tension on how the card should be played to best help oneself.  I actually appreciate the GW card and the added consideration/angst that it brings to the game.  Still not up to the level that Twilight Struggle brings to the table, it is a solid family game with a bit of strategy.

RATING: 8
Somewhat abstract area control game that has a lot of nice historical details added in the flavor text.  I tend not to notice the details during the gameplay however and the lack of thematic engagement (despite the thematic detail) keeps this game a step below 1960 and Twilight Struggle for me.

More plays will be needed to really digest this one, as at first it seems like there are far too many rounds when there isn't anything useful you can do, given your cards in hand (and swapping them out won't accomplish much either.)

Full credit for making a compelling game out of something that seems like it really shouldn't be a game.  Given the modest hand limit, your range of action is pretty restricted, though I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  Very nice production values.  The one thing I'd like to see is a speculative chart that tells you what kind of nation you've come up with given the articles you've approved or rejected.

Another great Jason Matthews et. al. title. Great flavor and that angsty decision making between several things you just have to do but just barely have the resources for. Some complain the Washington card is too powerful but he's only been used for his event once in the first 3 games we've played.

First impression after one 4p game.  Very entertaining, I would like to play it again to see if my first impression holds.  Nice theme and components, good level of player's interaction.  What I did NOT like is that you have to learn which cards do what so that when you need them you can recognize them while they are face down based on their back.  In other words, a lot to remember which turns this into a memory exercise and creates a knowledge gap with new players.  Even with a player aid summary of all cards this would be a problem given the sheer number of available cards.

A game that I [i]want[/i] to like more than I actually like. It's a great theme, but in actuality the game feels uneven. Points are scored in excruciatingly small doses... except occasionally when they fortuitously come in bunches. Cards can each be used for 3 things, and you have 3 cards... except you often struggle to set up a "good" play because cards can be surprisingly useless pretty regularly. Votes can be over in a blink... or they can drag on interminably.

With any other theme, or with any lesser production values, I don't think the game would stick around in my collection.

I like the premise of the game and similar to their heavier versions (TS and 1960), it has multiple paths to victory.  However, with cards that can end rounds early, it makes the game seem too random and takes away from the depth of the strategy.  I would rate this game higher without those cards.

I think it does what it sets out to do and does it well. But what it does is not something that I'm all that interested in experiencing. It's got a lot of "clever" mechanics, the rules are fairly easy to grasp and there's a lot of interesting history and flavor text on the cards. But ultimately I felt like I was hoping for a good card while I pushed around some influence cubes...er, rectangles.

The graphic design is blah. It's hard to read the card backs from across the table. And good luck implementing a strategy that survives until your next turn. Play is more tactical than strategic. I'm guessing that the Washington card is hit or miss: I had it from the beginning, didn't want to use it to vote and didn't want to discard it, but there was never a good opportunity to use it that benefited me or whacked the leader. So I used it to shut down the fourth round so that we could finish up before the venue closed down.

I like the theme better than "Currying favor with the Grand Poobah of Eurostuffindom to gain the honor of becoming Chief Latrine Inspector." But I still kind of felt like I was playing that game. Euros just don't "feel" like anything except puzzles, optimization exercises and math problems. They suck at my soul, and it hurts. It hurts bad.

If you put a gun to my head (please don't do that), I'd play this over any of the heavier Euros. But I'd much rather play Ra, LotR or King of Siam, all Euros that I've rated higher.

But still, I'd rather play something that's actually fun. Sigh. If only games were supposed to be fun. Oh, wait. Never mind.

A great game that really starts to shine after multiple plays. Unfortunately, as nice as the historical theme is, I think some players may have a difficult time making it beyond a single play because of the theme. However, If historically themed games and LCG/CCG card games rank high in your personal tastes, this game comes in at a strong '8'.

RATING: 6
For a multi-player CDG this is surprisingly dry. I do enjoy playing the game although it certainly does have some challange as your placements (delegation votes) are never really safe.  Each card has a special power so other players can often choose to hose you rather than improve their own positions.  That being said I do like the decisions of deciding whether to vote for an article, vote in the debate or use a special action.

Played once.  

For some reason my gaming group didn't all leap on the idea of playing a game where you mimic a committee meeting, but they should have.  This is a great, tense game from the same maker as 1960: Making of a President and Twilight Struggle, both games that I love.  This game has a historical theme, as do the other two, and it plays well.

The one thing I'm not sure about is the George Washington card; it got used twice in the game early in two rounds, cutting down the ability to tensely fight over things.  My temptation would be to restrict that card by saying that it can only end a round after 4 states have voted on one side of an issue (so the round isn't cut off immediately).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun game that shouldn't be played too often in a row because you'd learn the cards by heart soon enough and the game would start to drag because you're checking what everyone has and considering the options. An additional problem is that experienced players would school noobs everytime.

Just played the prototype, but so far it's a pretty solid CDG. Just a few rules need to be tweaked, but it seems to have good balance, and it's good to see a CDG besides Manifest Destiny finally take on multiplayer. It kind of reminded me a lot of Liberte' and it's workings. If you liked  1960 or Twilight Struggle, then I think you'll like Founding Fathers pretty well.

The rulebook makes it seem hopelessly complex, but it's actually pretty simple once you start playing. Vote in the assembly room, debate, play an event, or discard cards.

A pretty unique game, all things considered. Founding Fathers does have a strong emphasis on its theme, but you have to be able to read the flavor text to really get any sort of educational value out of the game. Aside from that, Founding Fathers is a Euro game with some wargame-like card play and area control. It isn't a particularly outstandingly-designed game on its own, but I think the theme helps to hold the mechanisms together. If you're not interested in the theme, however, you probably won't care for Founding Fathers.

An exceedingly well-themed area control game that's educational to boot.

Very disappointing. The theme feels completely wasted in what is essentially an abstract take-that game. The articles have no real presence - you either support one symbol or it's opposite. The cards are terribly unbalanced and also don't add to the theme. Combine this with an atrocious graphic design that makes the game much harder to play than need be and some of the flimsiest card stock I've seen in many years and you have a strong candidate for biggest letdown of the year.

Among my favorite thematic games.  The game is a beautifully made game with a great visual board, cards and rich, symbolic art.  While the game mechanics are anything but how The Constitution was made, the use of the "delegates" and their historical role was a brilliant way to blend a complex political history with that enjoyable "screw your neighbor" gaming challenge.  We suggest you play with all the "airs" including appropriate accents, 18th century American vocabulary, and a gavel to keep things under control.

First impression (5 players): I was expecting a much more ameritrash style of a game. I was pleasantly surprised it was very euroish after all.

The theme is a plus and theme + mechanics are working well.

The simplest ruleset from the duo so far.

Does not really work with three players: There's too little action going on in the assembly room, and the swings from the end scoring can be enormous.

This is a "card-driven game"--each card you draw has three different ways to use it, depending on the iconography and text.  Despite this, the game is very simple and plays smoothly.  While you're always presented with several options, many of them aren't useful, so you're really at the whim of card draws more than anything else.  As a game, I'd say it's good, but not great.  I do like the historical theme, though.

Beautiful components. Historical theme. Unusual objective for victory conditions.

I upped my score for this game after coming back a year later. The set collecting aspect, which seems obvious now, escaped me when first working through the rule set. The power of the states with fewer delegates at controlling the tempo for when each round ends, which also seems obvious now, also escaped me on earlier plays.

All the mechanics of Founding Fathers work together perfectly, and they all manage to portray the theme extremely well. I find my self announcing "Maryland votes Yea!" just like I was watching the movie 1776.

Great job with this one.

Founding Fathers was a highly anticipated game for me but my one play was disappointing. Unfortunately we messed up a rule (draw pool cards face up rather than face down), which really slowed things down as we pored over the cards. But regardless of that, I found the three-card hand really constraining. It's virtually impossible to plan more than one turn ahead, as you generally play 1-2 cards per turn and have to draw from whatever happens to turn up. And with draw pool face-down, it becomes important to memorise which events are associated with which state/faction combinations, which is not why I play games. I do like the way the different scoring methods are interlinked (though unsure if they are balanced), but for me this game is an unhappy middle ground between the quick, tactical Campaign Manager and the long, strategic, superb Twilight Struggle.

I very much like the theme (definitely a sucker for historical themes), and the production generally goes along well with it.
With more players it is tactical where you have to make the best of each round. Haven't played with fewer to see if it more strategic. 
Like the multiple use of cards or as an event, not sure of the balance of the different activities yet.

The flavouring on this is really amazing. Although the theme (politics /  debate) is not really "implemented" because debates cannot really implemented into a boardgame (or can they, anyone fancy a challenge ?). Anyhow, it comes down to some middleweight euro brain teaser puzzling, figuring out how to score the most points. The cards and the respective events on them spice up the game and make it a tad more dynamic although some or way too overpowering and that does really not go well with theme (I would not mind anarchic and chaotic gameplay in a game other than debating founding fathers but it feels misplace in this one and kind of imbalances the game quite a bit). I love the flavour texts, the information about the delegates and articles and am looking forward to playing this with history buffs. 

Great one. HX

RATING: 7.75
This was an amazingly fun game to play once you understood the mechanics.  The board is divided into two halves.  The Debate half and the Assembly half.  You hold three to four cards in your hand that represent a signer from a state.  You can use the cards to lock in a State to vote for an Article on the Assembly floor or you can use the cards to move your representative on the debate track.  The key to winning is gaining the chits on the debate track.  These chits become point multipliers at the end.

superb theme integration.  Cards need a little more balance work and less ability to know when the crazy ones are coming up.

However, most of the game is quite interesting, so I feel like this game is a few house rules away from being excellent.

I played a pre-production copy with the designer Jason Matthews as the instructor.  I loved it and I'm glad to see him putting out a 4-5 player game.  My game was 5 players and it played really well.  A definate buy for me.

Updated - I played the final version and it's even better than I remember.  It's dripping with theme and the mechanics are very straight forward once you get them.  Some detractors say the theme doesn't matter but for me I totally feel what the authors were trying to do.  Half the rule book is a history lesson which I don't think takes anything away from the game at all and adds to it if you want to take the time to read through it.  Great game.

Founding Fathers has definitely lost a lot of complexity in going from 2-player (Twilight Struggle, 1960) to a multiplayer format, but there is just enough depth to keep me going for a while. This game is Genji done right (collecting sets to match icons, attaining majorities etc), and I'm guessing a major part of it is the event text making this game feel a lot more immersive. Genji only has icons, and cheesy poems that do not express the theme the way event text can.

Lots of people complain that there is no integration of theme here and it's just matching icons and switching tactics ("political leans") from turn to turn based on the cards you have. True, but I think those people came in with inflated expectations for the theme.

3+3

On the surface, this game looks about as fun as eating paper - I mean, a game about passing bills to the Constitution?  Yikes.  But, once you get into the flow of the game, it plays pretty quickly and there is a good amount of screwage that can take place.  Yeah, its a little gamey, and some of the event cards just randomly give out what seems to be a high proportion of points, but I liked it.

After a couple more plays of this, FF is getting downgraded to a 6.  The cards give out way too many points at random and if the cards don't come up for you, you are screwed.  The game seems to be missing something such as being able to trade the influence markers for a bonus or something.  Plus, no tie-breaker?  I'll play it with the right company, but I liked it better with 3 players than with 4 or 5.

[6 plays]  I enjoyed my first play of Founding Fathers despite my lack of success and bearing the brunt of the screw you moves by other players. Sometimes you're just that guy. Anyway, further reflection has me convinced that this is a pretty solid implementation of a 1960 style card driven experience for multiplayer. I also enjoy the theme and I now look forward to reading the extensive historical notes in the rulebook. The replayability should be decent, and the knowledge of the possible events should be a bonus with repeated plays. The artwork and components are all quite nice, although the cards could have more functional graphics and be of better quality.

Update after 2nd play: Solid multiplayer version of the mechanics from 1960:MoP with a constitution theme. I think this needs to come out a little more often to be appreciated more.

I love Jason Matthews' games.  The way theme and mechanics mesh always *feels* very poloitical.  From the simple and fast Campaign Manager right through to Twilight Struggle this is a stand out feature.  Sure they are all collaborations but JM is the common element and he is a self-confessed "wonk".  :)

Founding Fathers is probably my favourite political game - the mood is great, the art is great and so is the gameplay.  There are lots of ways to win - our group has seen victories from at least three different paths.  It is always a tricky choice with every turn about whether to debate, play an event or vote - sometimes even to deliberately vote on the losing side.  The main reason for the latter option being that the losing delegations then conspire back stage to influence the outcome of the next article to be passed.  Even though this conspiracy happens  in the committee room space on the board - it feels like a lot of the wheeling and dealing probably happens at the local pub!

Multiplayer CDG-type game, on the lighter end of the scale. Good, although I would have preferred something heavier (like Twilight Struggle) and I miss having a board (with relevant geographic play elements). Seems too chaotic, with less ability to control one's own fate, with the full complement of five. I wonder if I would prefer it with 3, or maybe four?

RATING: 7
Political games rank with sports as my favorite genre. I couldn't wait to play it and, though I still enjoyed it, I did feel underwhelmed.  Perhaps we are all too green as far as strategy, but it initially feels a little too claustrophobic, making the most of tiny hands and hoping to draw a killer action. Still, I like the historical flavor and enjoy the game and my rating is malleable right now, so it could change just like one of the articles being voted upon.

One of my most anticipated games of 2010 because I love the designers other games.

However...


The graphic design is one of the most annoying of any game I have played. A real triumph of style over function.

There  is the kernel of a good game in here (the relationship between the assembly. ctte room and debates) , partly spoilt by the graphics (impossible to see which states are in the card pool from across the table) also by overpowered ,or unbalanced, cards.

For example first round first player  plays event that gives them unclaimed debate tokens at end of round, everyone else has small states which is played by next player. Then first player plays Washington - bang! three tokens for nothing other than luck of the cards.

Or play event that says 'no events playable'  on first round - which makes the rest of the round an endurance test in the luck of the draw.

Repeat in third round. Maybe i'm missing something but I can't see what. 

There is a severe lack of control in the game - the hand size and over powered events cause a frustrating chaos. Moreover it becomes a memory game as you try to remember what uber event goes with which state and faction, added to constant references to the faction distribution.

Its the first non hit from these two and maybe my disappointment is a result of unrealistic expectations, maybe the next multi player game will get to the heights of TS or 1960.

Interesting game with a nice set of options -- however since the backings show and there are a limited number of possible combinations a player who has played before is at a HUGE advantage.

I also dislike some of the cards abilities, as some (George Washington especially) can be game breakingly overpowered. 

EDIT: Finally played it again 7 years later. It was decent but feels a bit dated. Still have a problem with George Washington's strength. I also found it a bit imbalanced on some other aspects such as the wild symbol people. Overall, it wasn't bad, but wasn't amazing either. Wish there was a bit more depth and things going on, but I'd probably play it again (hopefully with 4 to reduce the "these two attack each other and the third person profits" problem).

RATING: 9
Excellent card-driven game with an unusual theme. Players take the role of one of the delegates of 1776 as they attempt to write the US Constitution. Each card depicts one of the delegates and performs one of three different roles available to it - voting for or against an article (depending on state and faction bias), debating for a particular faction (depending on faction bias), or performing an event (which are based on historical occurrences). The game is one of the most theme-rich I've played and the different mechanics blend brilliantly. There'a a fair bit of luck involved with the draw of the cards and it can be a bit frustrating if you're unable to match your delegates/factions with the articles currently being voted on as this is where the majority of the game's victory points come from, so in that respect the game does feel ever so slightly imbalanced. The production values are first-class, the rule book brilliantly written and the historical detail enhances the experience enormously.

First play very positive. Excellent systems, very good flavour and a real triumph to make this process fascinating. I would question some of the card strengths, but I will not worry too much until I have played again.

Also, a lot of voting went 'nay'. Is this significant?

Pretty abstract. Though ostensibly you're drafting the articles of the US constitution, you're really just collecting points for being (anti-)federalist or (anti-)big state. Pretty abstract, really. Some amusing reading might be had in the anti-historical articles, but they're rather hard to read.

While obviously American in theme, definitely Euro in design rather than thematic.

Despite the pedigree, Founding Fathers is an average game of influence with a historical veneer pasted on.  The voting aspect works, but the debate tracks are almost entirely abstract and the committee room has no bearing in reality: the losers of the main vote get to decide the outcome of the next vote?  Moreover, the barely-legible card backs neutralize the most interesting aspect of the game--knowing which states your opponents could play.

George Washington card seems WAY too powerful. (UPDATE: yes it is and I think unbalances gameplay, however this is VERY historically accurate as I find out in my college studies. When he got up and would leave the room, the day was over!)

Jolly Roger did a fine job with the components, although the cards are a bit flimsy, and Josh Cappel did a fantastic job with the artwork as always, and Scott Anderson with the development. I played two games of Founding Fathers over the weekend, once on Thursday and then again on Friday, both with five players. I really enjoyed the game, much more so than either 1960 or Campaign Manager, although certainly not as much as Twilight Struggle. It’s comparable to Matthews and Co.’s previous games  in terms of the central card-driven mechanic and in that you can use any given card for a variety of purposes. The principal difference of course is that the game is multiplayer, supporting from three to five players. I’d really like to try the game with fewer players because I think it would be easier to keep track of everything that’s going on and a bit less chaotic. There’s a good deal of information on the back of the cards unlike in most card games, so it’s sometimes important to be able to track the back of each card in your opponents’ hands and in the draw pool. I also sometimes felt a bit hamstrung in terms of what I could do on my turns so I might consider expanding the draw pool by a couple cards in the future, which I gather the designers considered but reduced to trim game length, although if I play with fewer players then perhaps the two things would offset. I did certainly appreciate that there is a significant consolation prize for being on the losing side of any given vote because luck of the draw and the whims of your fellow players could conspire against you so a consolation prize seems only fitting. The game was in almost constant play at the convention and seemed to be garnering generally favorable reactions with most people bound to try to place it somewhere in their personal hierarchy of the previous Matthews, Leonhard, and Gupta offerings. I find it’s very tough for a designer to develop successive good games especially when expectations climb steadily higher (see, e.g., Martin Wallace and also Splotter with their Duck Dealer debacle), but Founding Fathers proves to be a very intriguing game that was enjoyable to play and will certainly warrant further exploration.

A good game with some goofy options when it comes to altering the structure of the Constitution.  The speed with which the game can be played is certainly a plus.  On the downside, I still do not see the reason for the inclusion of debate tokens, since winning on the debate track does not actually impact either the bill on the floor or the bill in committee.

This title is SOLID.  It is easily one of the best games I've played in a while, and it has wonderful mechanics.

If you write this game off based on theme, you're really doing yourself a diservice.  The game features strong hand management, some area control, lots of special actions, and gobs of player screwing antics.  It takes the best parts of an area control game and a political title, and smashes them together.  

I think the art design could use a little help, but overall I was very impressed with how well this game flowed, and how it all panned out in the end.

Do yourself a favor and give this game a try.

Newest game from the pair that made 1960: The Making of the President. The goal here is to be the founding father with the most renown at the end of the game, which consists of the making of the US constitution. Players have a hand of delegates that represent a state, defend an issue and have a special ability. A different issue of the constitution is considered each round while players use delegates to either help or go against the issue.

Unlike most of the Matthews designs, I have a harder time seeing the connection between the gameplay and the overall theme (how do the planners influence the delegates?) I feel it conveys the bargaining/compromise nature of the Constitution, but not much about why the compromises were made (fame is probably not one of the main reasons, seeing that most of what we know come from Madison's notes)

I must say I was very pleased with this title with my first play.  Tough decisions between events, voting influence and faction majority, as well as timing moves to your advantage.  Looking forward to another shot at this one.

Twilight Struggle is one of my favorite games.  So, I already know I would like to have this Jason Mathews game.  I'm holding off on making it a must have until I hear how well it plays with two.

A perfectly alright game.  Not bad, but not great either.  Jason Matthews' designs continue to trend more and more toward drier Eurogame tropes.  The theme is here, but it's really doesn't feel very strong.  The play feels like any other Euro where I was grubbing for victory points.  Perhaps many of these mechanics were initially theme-driven, but the way that the eventual implementation happened feels very removed from the actual Constitutional Convention.  There's lots of nods to the theme, but they don't seem to impact gameplay much at all.  Instead of aiming for thematic goals that make sense, it feels much more like looking for the exploitable loopholes in the game.  

Much has been made about this being a multiplayer card-driven game that allows all people to interact with the cards.  Well, it doesn't feel like a card-driven game, or at least not a card-driven game in the same sense as [gameid=12333] or [gameid=234].  There are no operations points, no spatial layout on the board, and no player factions.  Instead of events being tied to particular factions or players, usually they are frustratingly generic, and often so weak that they are not used, with a few exceptions.  They feel, in short, more like the types of cards you see in Euros, rather than the thick thematic touches of most card-driven games.

Founding Fathers is a bit of a strange duck. It is absolutely dripping with theme, but the gameplay is almost completely removed from the topic at hand, debating and drafting the U.S. Constitution. Don't get me wrong, you are indeed controlling which states are voting for or against specific articles as well as how their representatives are spending their time, either in debate, back room dealing or delivering rousing speeches. It's just that the players themselves are sort of removed from the process. As a player, your goals are self-determined. You can push for Federalism or states rights, but you don't have to decide which way you are playing until well into the game.

This is of course, great as far competitive decision points go. It just feels weird having this sort of sandbox play environment attached to a historical simulation. Ironically, I think it feels off because the designers and publishers have done such a great job of presenting all the historical background on the cards and in the rulebook. It is good for a laugh being dealt James Madison as your character role and then acting as an anti-Federalist the whole game, but you have to be fairly well-versed in the history to get the joke...which again seems off since one of the primary goals of these types of games is to educate.

Weird vibe or not, what is important is the game play. What the game does deliver well is a fun and interactive card game. It almost feels like a TCG, with card effects changing rules, manipulating the environment and even combo chaining with other cards. Most of the card effects do a nice job of feeling appropriate to the real life historical figure they represent, which is always great for inspiring memorable moments and entertaining table talk. Regardless of the confusion I feel about what the game is trying to simulate, there is no question that it delivers an incredibly fun and engaging time while it is on the table, which is really all you can ask from any game.

Gran bel gioco sulla stesura della Costituzione Americana, il tema si sente particolarmente per il resto è un classico gioco di maggioranze con i più l'utilizzo degli eventi proposti dalle carte che cambiano completamente i giochi.Facile ma profondo.

Another one of those games that didn't really draw me in, mainly because I don't think I had a chance to grasp the overall system before the game was almost over.

I'd file this under "Will try again, but not optimistic."

Played a pre-production copy at Gateway 2009.  Jason Matthews was Special Guest and teacher. 

Looks to be a great game.  Does a good job bringing a card driven game to a 5 player game.  Game might be a little fiddly, but good graphic design should solve that problem.

Looking forward to picking this one up when it is ready to go!

Played final copy - great game.  Graphic design is excellent.

Designers will never learn.  Adding overpowered cards to a game that is already extremely draw-dependent is a terrible idea.

Also, if you really want to take the game seriously, you have to attend to the other players' in-hand cards at all times - which doubles the length of the game for no additional payoff.

There are a small handful of games that leave me bitter and angry.  This is one of them.

Great use of a CDG for multiplayer.  I enjoy Matthews and Leohhard's designs, but have trouble finding tine to sit down with only one opponent.  This appears to solve that problem. :)  As with other of the duo's designs, there is a balance to use the cards on the board to score points and use the events.  Limiting influence markers makes the decisions even more intense.  Great game that I hope to play more.

A quick, multi-player, card driven, historical board game. Yup, I liked it!

The historical aspects of this game are just amazing. I love learning about this important and fundamental event in our world, and even living it a bit through a game. My one nitpick is that picking cards with events from an array leads to the game slowing down a bit, as you really must read them to find the optimal match for your strategy.

The graphics are nice, and I found it highly enjoyable. I look forward to playing it again some time.

I found this highly anticipated game to be disappointing.  The theme was overwhelmed by the mechanics and it ended up feeling like I was simply moving counters around that had nothing to do with the constitution (unlike 1960 Making of the President). Scoring seemed a bit weird too.

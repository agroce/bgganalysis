Fabulous! Among the best games I ever played. Well designed, and quite easy despite the many factors to keep in mind during the game. I love how the game properly balances unpredictability with actual strategy. I love the line of support mechanism and how the EZOC are managed. The GMT version of the game is so elegant and fabulous that it is truly a crime not to own a copy. This is a must to have!

I still can't believe how effortlessly this little game succeeds at making the whole Eastern Front campaign playable in one evening. Amazing, and it works! Both from historical and gamer point of view. If only it wasn't so ugly. It just screams for sort of deluxe edition *dream*

RATING: 9
Very interesting game. I suspected a game like this with so few pieces could get very dry and chess-like.  However, the cards add just enough chaos to make combat not completely predictable.  I also like how the cards can be used as resources.

RATING: 9
This has held up quite well, and I still like it a lot. I'll probably wait for the new GMT edition though (scheduled for early 2011) to give it some more play, though, just because I hope the new edition will have better bits. The VPG version isn't bad, but no question the cheap components and the overall low-budget production to inhibit the enjoyment of playing somewhat.

Played once, very positive first impressions. Plays quickly and cleanly while giving both players tough choices. Cards seem well integrated. You can play a year in 45 minutes, yet the game still feels reasonably authentic. Definitely on my play list to get some future game time. Will pre-order from GMT if it holds up to a few more plays, which I have every reason to believe it will. A welcome antidote to the many overwrought and over-long East Front games.

I must say that I wasn't expecting much from No Retreat!, but I was pleasantly surprised. At its heart this is a simple game, but there are several nice twists that elevate it above its peers. A big plus is that the full 41-44 game can be played in a day, and this puts it as a provisional first on my list of East Front strategic games. Hopefully I'll get more plays in that will confirm my initial impressions.

RATING: 4
Not a terrible game; but I have missed what others seem to like. I found it dull and uninteresting. It's supposed to be the Russian Front for god's sake, but it's a teeny-weenie game. That gives it rather a lot to overcome to get the right feel. It also raises the question: what's the point of a tiny Russian Front game? I'll have to think about that one.

The game scale is so huge that the Germans practically blow every Russian unit off the map on turn one. But guess what? All those units get recycled. Over and over and over again. And yeah, it follows the script: the Huns make great strides in '41, but come up . . . just . . . short. Then they kick a little more ass when it warms up in '42, yadda, yadda. 

The whole thing seems very scripted, and a bit chess-like. Since there are so few units and so little space, each decision about where to put a unit, or where to attack, is greatly magnified--hence the chess-like feel. I think the designer says the game provides interesting "puzzles". If you like that, great, but I find it irritating. 

It also feels like there are a number of rules that seem less like chrome and more like stuff contrived to make sure things stick to the script (the blitz/shock markers; the "event" VPs; the various weather rules; the replacement rules; the CRT). It all must have been playtested and tweaked to a fine point--usually that's a good thing, but here it all feels rigged. 

What passes for the OB is a good example. The fudge factor here would make Willy Wonka puke, so why even bother to name the units? You get the feeling that if the Southwest unit wasn't letting the Germans through fast enough in testing as a "5", so make it a "3"--what's a hundred thousand Russians between friends?

I guess none of this matters if you like the gameplay (in fact, if you like the gameplay, it's all brilliant design work). But I didn't like the gameplay. So off to the shelf it goes.

Dare I say probably the best Eastern Front Strategy game ever made.

Why?

1. Very engaging gameplay, game is balanced, challenging for both sides, replayable and historical too boot.

The game has to be played carefully by both sides.

2. Short game time. While I myself can play a wargame for a max of a few days. This game can  be played within 1 evening or even less.

3. Excellent and clever system, excellent card system combined with evolutionary and clever mechanics.

4. Very manageable game, with low numbers of counters with no clutter. Kicks the ass of East Front strategic game many times its size.

5. Very fun too boot!!!!(That's the goal of playing games). Learning and having fun!!!!

RATING: 7
Small game on the largest war in history, the Nazi-Soviet War.  Much better than any other game that I've played on the topic, although that bar isn't too high.  The history is much better than those other games, as a blitzkrieg actually develops and the German 1941 advance proceeds along plausible lines.  The mechanics are interesting, but a couple of them started to annoy me after my initial excitement with the game.  The "counterblow" mechanic--where the non-phasing player forces the phasing player to launch an attack involuntarily during his turn--keeps the game interactive and somewhat unpredictable.  Unfortunately, it can also be used in a gamey fashion to get defenders out of their defensive terrain without ever attacking them, a la Across 5 Aprils.  But what eventually got the game off the table for me was the CRT.  There are two, one for each player.  The Axis table is much better than the Soviet one, to an absurd degree.  For example, the Axis has a better chance of success on a 1:2 attack than the Soviets do on a 3:2.  Since German tactical superiority is already built into the units' combat values, I'm not sure what this is meant to accomplish.  It makes the combat odds not particularly important, which means that all the things that affect odds--like terrain, weather, and event cards--don't have the impact that it seems they should.  On a related note, it bothered me that while German tactical superiority seems to be double-counted, Soviet operational superiority seems to be ignored entirely.  During the war, the Soviets were generally better at getting troops where they needed to be, and at times (e.g. during Fall Blau) were able to retreat faster than the Germans could advance.  That can't happen in this game, where the Soviets inexplicably have lower movement factors than even the German foot-borne infantry.  I have a suspicion that these two design decisions--both which favor the Axis--bias both the balance and the history in their favor.

I'll probably revisit this game--which honestly has a lot of good things going for it--at a later date, but I'll likely never play again without a variant CRT.  I haven't been this turned off by a combat system since For the People.

RATING: 9
An excellent design that will garner increasing attention and popularity with proposed future releases.

The game seems minimalist with 40 unit counters and a small map, but the card-enhanced gameplay and counter-blow mechanic make it very challenging and fun.  The game time recommended is fair, but can be too low once you become immersed in a game, and finding yourself concentrating hard to make the best decision.

Cards have multiple uses: each can temproarily alter the basic rules of play (i.e. attacking advantage, special effect, etc.), or be used to bring in replacements, or discarded for a counter-blow.  Lots of tough decisions result.

The counter-blow mechanic is quite innovative and something we should see in other game designs.  Some games let you attack wherever you wish, others require that all units in a ZOC must be attacked.  The counter-blow forces the attacker to deal with some of the defender's forces, at the defender's choosing.

Every game I played has been very enjoyable.

Game support from the designer is also excellent.

This game is a forthcoming classic!

Intrigued.  I want this.  (My one experience with another VPG game, Borodino 20 with sdiberar at BGG.CON '08, was positive, too.)

2009-01-17: it's in the mail, as a "you didn't get laid off" present to myself.

2009-01-20: [i]holy crap[/i] they packed a lot of stuff into that ziplock!  Component quality is "just OK" (there's a slight mismatch in the cutting of the top & bottom stickers on my counters, the map is inkjet-printer quality), but to me it's "good enough," and I'm looking forward to finding out how it plays.

2009-01-25: after a couple of solitaire games to learn the rules (both Axis sudden death victories--one in turn 3 due to hellish die rolls, one in turn 9 due to a big bag of Soviets getting put OOS), I think this is pretty neat.  I like the way the cards are handled, and there are other neat little things, like the gradual improvement of the Soviet units, the difficulty the Germans have in keeping their units strong, and the pressures exerted in different directions by the various victory conditions.

2009-01-30: finally got to play this face-to-face.  Fun!  Another Axis sudden death victory, this time in turn 6.

2009-02-27: another solitaire game, Axis sudden death turn 9 (something like 18 VP, a "convincing" win, ha ha).  They had a combination of hellish die rolls and the right cards at the right time; I thought their opening hand was terrible, but it turned out to be great for screwing with the Soviet hand.  Although the Axis has won every game, I'm looking forward to trying it again; I am clearly doing something sub-optimal as the Soviets.

I'd read the hype before picking "No Retreat" up at WBC. Even so, I was blown away. I cracked it open in my hotel room intending to play a turn or two before bed to see how it worked -- and was hooked until the wee hours. Clean, innovative, and an obvious labor of love, this design truly captures the ebb and flow of WWII's Eastern Front and is playable in a sitting. Perhaps the best praise I can give it that my 30-year-old copy of The Russian Campaign may be finally ready for retirement (or at least a well-deserved vacation).

RATING: 10
A surprisingly fun game that is accurate as well as exciting.
Small, portable and easy to get into.
As someone else put it: easy to learn but hard to master. This characteristic has kept me coming back repeatedly, trying to solve the different puzzles within.

Definitely recommend getting the No Surrender addition which significantly improves on the already excellent design.

Excellent support from VPG too!

Reasonably clean system, though with some rules issues. Plays fast and has a very small footprint which I like, but looks like the unit scale is almost a bit out of sync with the map scale, certainly on the Soviet side.  The card system provides some variation but is essentially unconnected to the map situation - that part feels rather gamey.  I'd certainly play this over Russian Campaign, but in no big hurry to play again.

RATING: 9
First impressions are very favourable. The game generates a plausible narrative and requires both sides to make some difficult strategic decisions. I think that it will be highly replayable and well suited to pbem as it's not particularly interactive. 

If I had any criticisms they would be that precise placement of units (especially for the Soviets) is very important with hex geometry considerations sometimes a bit too prominent for my taste. The turn 3 sudden death victory condition is tricky to avoid. 

The event cards can be very powerful if they are played at the right time, although they are also needed for many other functions (e.g. replacing destroyed units) and woe betide the side that runs out. 

All in all it's definitely an old-style players game in that the more experienced/skilful player will probably win but at the same time it follows history well and the cards inject enough chaos to prevent the formulation of perfect plans

Well designed strategic level mini wargame that covers the entire Eastern Front WW2 in about 5hrs.  The cards are a nice enhancement to a solid game system.  However, maybe because of the scale, feels a bit abstract and does not for me, capture the sweep and openness of the Russian Front like other games.

Game seems to follow historic lines.  Chess like in play.  Would be great to see this game system expanded to cover the ETO WW2.

Excellent game from my friend Carl Paradis: You can play the entire Eastern Front (up to 44 - 45 with "Na Berlin" add-on) in a day! This is a strategic game, but the card system is well integrated and the Combat Results Tables (one per side) give an historical loss level. Quite an amazing feat never accomplished before on the Eastern Front... The rules are clear and short and Carl‚Äôs support is outstanding.

The Deluxe version from GMT should enhance an already very good graphic level.

A surprising amount of depth in the game considering the counter limit and the scale.  My only gripe is the quality of the counters/markers which is forgiveable due to VPG's small publisher model.  After laminating the flat components and sleeving up the cards I have no problems.

Seriously considering Na Berlin! and other VPG stuff now.

Extremely playable and replayable treatment of the WWII Eastern Front.  You can easily play the entire campaign in an afternoon, while the scenarios generally play in an hour or so.

I was even more impressed with the way historical situations can emerge naturally from the base rules (8 pages, albiet rather compressed), without resorting to a lot of chrome.  IMO, a game can't be great while it has to be led to reality with a chrome leash.

This game reminds me of the old AH Stalingrad, but with cards that can effect combat.  It is very hex & counter-ish with odds computation, supply tracing, advance after retreats (which can manifest breakthroughs), and counter-attacks.  It is a fun, small, and portable ziplock game (scale: German units represent Armies/Soviet's have Army Groups).  Chrome includes rail movement, boxes for eliminated units that can be reorganized and returned to the game; step reduction and recovery to full strength; snow & mud turns; and more.

Rating after two solo plays of Barbarossa Scenario.

Rules are pretty well written, and the few questions they bring up are quickly answered by the author and in the FAQ/forums.

Ground combat is well represented, as are armored breakthroughs.  Other elements of combat and politics are abstracted into cards.  The cards however don't drive the action or force a direction of play, but rather augment your plans or distract from opponent's.

So far, seems like a GREAT and PORTABLE game!

" I've always had a fascination with the eastern front wargame genre and have yet to find one that is truly satisfactory to my taste..
                     -- A Grognard--

I highly recommend that if you dig East Front games,
you will absolutely enjoy this little marvel of a game called NO RETREAT!.

It covers the war from 41-44 and is extremely historical and a gas to play. (did I mention it is
historical and fun to play?).

It is a Germany Army/ Soviet Front size game with less pieces than you could ever imagine.  The map board is 11x17" with about 20 actual units and 20 other markers.
There is some critical card play but the game is not a card generated game.

The designer in my opinion has created a masterpiece.  He strived to make a game where "more is less", and I have not found any "quirks" in game play or any weird notions in the rules, i.e., there are no "patches" .  I found that the rules are so clean  I can  enjoy the  game play. I have been able to teach the "basics" to a new-comer in 25 minutes of play.

NO RETREAT! can be had for a mere $25 and it is in my view one of the most playable games I have enjoyed
since, well my days with the classic games.

 BUT unlike the classics, 
this game is 
a top-notch simulation. I am reading "When Titans Clashed..." and "Thunder in the East" and I am amazed
at how closely this this game reflects
the historical problems each side had to resolve.
Namely Stalin and Hitler ordered their troops to
standfast!  Like some EF games it's ok If you  give up ground, that's not an easy thing to do (and certainly not historical) in this game; also general retreats may very well be out of your control,and retreating or withdrawal as a game plan will often lead to loss of cities and most likely a quick defeat!

The card play also adds to the historical flavor and
they represent military resources. The more
cards in hand the better your chances of sustaining your offense/defense. The Axis especially need to have cards in hand durning the harsh winters.
If you read the above books, you would almost think you were playing No Retreat! BUT THE PROOF IS IN THE PLAY AND (WE) PLAYERS HAVE COMPARED GAME
PLAY WITH HISTORICAL SITUATION AND YEP IT IS ALWAYS VERY CLOSE. 

A very brave decision was to include an historical weather table and a historical high tide and then a change of offensive initiative.
THE AXIS have the initiative through Jan/Feb 1943
(the first 11 turns) and the last 11 (Mar/Apr 1943
and on) are for Soviet pleasure. Essentially, the side who has the initiative will possess a greater variety of cards that will sustain an offensive operation. All is not lost  if the Axis have not achieved a victory by the end of '42; they still have a chance to stall the
Reds and get a marginal victory. Basically you could say the campaign game is two games in one! Sorry there will be no clear weather in December of 1941! And yes the Soviets morph
slowly into a very well organized and powerful force. As the Axis player, you know it's just a matter of time,
so plan your seasonal offensives carefully.


Everyone who has tried it says it is an outstanding piece of work. Some scenarios can be played in as short as 50 minutes while the campaign game is a devoted affair. Also Carl Paradis,
the designer has put in extra effort to support this game! 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: VERY HISTORICAL, EXCELLENT PLAY

Un jeu extraordinaire.
Des r√©gles simples, mais intelligentes et malignes, permettant de grandes finesses tactiques et strat√©giques.
Tout ce qui dans les autres jeux sur le m√™me th√©me prend des pages de r√©gles est pr√©sent ici, mais est expliqu√© en un paragraphe.

Pour vous donner une id√©e, un ami qui ne connaissait pas le jeu est venu jouer avec moi, je lui ai expliqu√© les r√©gles en 15 minutes. Nous avons jou√© le sc√©nario d'initiation "Moscou" en une demi-heure. 
Puis apr√©s un "set-up" de 4 minutes, nous avons jou√© la campagne pendant le reste de l'apr√©s-midi et la soir√©e. La partie, tr√©s disput√©e, c'est finie au d√©but 44 quand suite √† une perc√©e, 4 arm√©es allemandes encercl√©es se sont rendues. 

Avec une carte plus jolie, j'aurais mis 10 √† No Retreat, note que m√©ritera surement la version de GMT qui sortira bientot.

Anyone who ever liked Russian Campaign should love this. With more premium components this will turn out to be a classic. The counterblow rules are not very easy to develop accurate tactics for, as they are far different than anything I have seen in wargames. But they sure do work out. The cards are interesting, some virtual gamebreakers, but most fit in the flow perfectly. It is hard to survive as the Soviet, but then again this makes for an interesting game.

Downgraded due to the fact that it is not always clear which cards take precedence over which, turning games into debates regarding whose interpretation of the rules is best. It is still, however, an amazingly novel and interesting game.

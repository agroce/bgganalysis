Fast, funny party game! Simultaneously play is great, you cannot get boring, you do not have to wait for your turn. A lot of emotions, a little bit of strategy.

The game is fast, funny and easy to learn! Ideal when you have some spare night after (or before) a boardgame night! 

I highly suggest as a drinking game!

Backed on Kickstarter, finally got to play last night. 6 of us played and 6 of us loved it. Super fast game, great for putting one over on friends and we used it as a wind down game, end of the night!

Love this game. It's a great mix of bluffing and 'push your luck' mechanic with a solid theme and great production values. There's enough room for strategy and manipulation but plenty of opportunity for luck to kick you in arse too.

It's my go-to game for non-gamers to introduce these mechanics.

Fantastic blend of Skull with Cash 'n Guns and a dose of the macabre. It's a little more weighty than Skull but captures its Push your Luck essence heightened by bluffing with a more addictive turn structure and some special action cards that bring in the unexpected. Highly recommended.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

First off - I LOVE the components of this game. It's aesthetically pleasing and the presentation of information is top-notch. It's the kind of game anyone can sit down and just play, and so much of that is to do with the components. Really impressed.

As for the game itself, it's solid. It's funny and dramatic, and it runs at a good pace. The bluffing is a little too thin for me to really love it, but I'll pretty happily play it.

This game has some tense and exciting moments, but isn't strategically deep.  It is a fun party game or filler.  The theme may be too dark for some, but it went over fine with my group.

super fun!  our group was a bit unsure of the theme but were hooked after 1 game.  90 minutes later,we had to wrap up for the night and started planning the next game night.  perfect 6 player game with simultaneous action so its quick and no downtime.

Picked up on Kickstarter.  From the makers of Two Rooms and Boom.

The theme is a bit macabre, but the game itself is really fun.  A bit of press-your-luck, a bit of bluffing, a bit of strategy to hit a high number of spins, and the event cards turn it upside-down at times.

The key: You must get even cards by either challenging correctly or being challenged.  The person who gets the most is most likely to win.  

There does seem to be a time when you can combine event cards to get you 4 or 5 trigger pulls if you time it correctly and no one else bonks you.

RATING: 8.5
I've played this game likely 50 or more times at this point, with 95% of those being me demo-ing it for others. And I'm not sick of it at all. In fact, I continue to enjoy it. It's quick, amusing, light, and always entertains the players. The game is mostly a mix of press-your-luck and bluffing with strategic twists added by bonus action cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I'm biased as I am the publisher of this game. Regardless, it is the best press-your-luck bluffing game there is! It is quick to learn, easy to play, but offers real depth and deep decisions.

If neither you nor anyone else in your group is put off by the theme, this is a fun party game.

I love this game.  It really hits a sweet spot between party game and something more substantial.  

It's got some nice social interaction/social deductions without relying on the werewolf engine.  

Components are solid and art is beautiful.  

The theme is a lot of fun and done with the right blend of humor and stylized noirish art that doesn't take itself too seriously.  

Lasts just long enough to keep you wanting more with two win conditions: 15 points or last man standing, the points cause people to take risks, the limited lives keep the game exciting.

Perfect amount of push your luck, plenty of tactical decisions, a little bit of strategy, and just the right amount of take that.

I think this one is underrated personally.  Despite having more rules than your average party game my nongamer friends ask to play it.

RATING: 2
World Championship Russian Roulette is a bluffing push your luck game. Players have a have of seven cards they draw, one with a bullet and five blanks. Additionally one of the seven is hidden away, allowing player to hide the bullet. This is the only bluffing in the game, trying to determine if players hid their bullet or not. there is hardly information to base any claims on and decisions feel meaningless. The theme is provocative but hollow. The game is less than it appears and overstays its welcome. Some accusations of bluffing can be fun, but those occasions are far and few in-between. The bluffing feels meaningless and pushing your luck to see how many bullet cards one can go through is arbitrary. Bluffing and push your luck are each done much better elsewhere.

Doesn't have enough qualities of a "game". Feels more like a yolofest Cash n Guns style. If thats your thing, sure, but I'd rather play something with more...play to it?

GREAT! Really good fun, lots of laughter with this one, heart and soul to the bluffing is the action cards, they are really cleverly (and carefully) devised and a lot less chaotic-take-that than I thought they'd be.

Great tight game that hits a nice balance of luck, strategy, and bluffing.  While the rules have a lot of layers, they play out in a logical way that's easy to pick up.  Love the reveal moments throughout with each clock and the left turns that the action cards bring to the game.

At first this seems to be a game to pass time while waiting to play other games, but with the right people can be a lot of fun and there is a good amount of strategy to employ....luck is also a factor but the ability to bluff is key to success. 
The design is great and I love the dice.

I cannot recall a more immersive game I have played. Everyone in the game feels the tension as the clicks go by and a bang seems more imminent. Shouting, laughter (mostly of relief) and groans punctuate, and each turn is a wrenching experience. One of the best Kickstarters I have backed.

Had a lot of success bringing this to people new/unfamiliar with the hobby.  Clear design language help make it easy to teach and answer questions, although the high number of phases can be initially daunting to new players.  Once you get people playing they catch on quickly.  Overall its an engaging, light, push-your-luck game best enjoyed over a few (or many) beers.

A point for production quality, and a point for being an actual game. Sure, it had its moments of debased fun. However, the theme is absolutely absurd and just nagged at me throughout the entire play. In what scenario would I introduce such a light game to family or friends who enjoy light games, when there are a plethora of others which are either 1) more streamlined, and/or 2) more strategic?

Why play this bluffing/push-your-luck game when there are so many superior choices? i.e. Liar's Dice if in the mood for skillfull play, Port Royal for some "game" mixed into the push-your-luck element, or Diamant for some simple double-think-who-breaks-first fun. 

(+) Nice art.
(+) Great component quality.
(+) Sound bluffing mechanisms.

(-) Romanticized Russian roulette. 
(-) Lacks depth.
(-) Overabundance of randomness.

Best described in the same fashion as the other 2-star review here: tasteless.

Demoed this at GenCon 2016. Graphic design is top notch and the push-your-luck mechanic is pretty darn extreme. 

I can see this being a lot of fun to pull out after a couple drinks. Nearly pre-ordered it on the spot.

RATING: 9
A silly, clever game that adds just enough strategy to an intrinsically luck-based premise. Style counts for a lot in board gaming, and this has it in spades. Every tense moment of the game requires you to hold a fingergun to your head, ideally miming a sudden, jarring, spastic death when you pull your BANG! card. The action cards don't only add strategy, they also play with this "roleplay" mechanic - you can earn the right to aim one pull at the ceiling, or another player, and in that moment, finally removing the gun from your temple and instead weaponizing it for yourself, you go from feeling nervous to powerful. And then maybe you just hear a "click!", and it turns out you were safe anyway! Emotional rollercoasters like that are why I recommend this game to anyone. It's simple enough for anyone to understand, even new gamers, and it's such a fast and light little gem that you can fit it in anywhere in your schedule. Everyone should try this once.

Push-your-luck game with heavy emphasis on the luck aspect. Played at Gen Con. There's some clever interactions between the cards but luck is such a significant element that I don't expect this game to sustain much interest.

I liked the theme and feel of the game.  The political tracks are a nice touch.  The reserve cards were a good idea, also.  Many good ideas, such as the foreign wars and naval rules.  A really smart design and far better than I thought it would be.

Among the first "CDG" games I've played, and good fun - the ending early on a die roll threat is .. interesting, but not sure I actually like it.  Would not keep me from playing again as I love the system.

This game is hard to learn from the rules, even with the new rulesbook. That is the only thing that stops me from rating this a 10.Once past the rules, this is a blast to play. It is not a scripted game, so it will go off the hisorical tracks quite easily, without losing its play value. With more players, it will vary more than with fewer.Downtime is not a problem IMO. Players who do not pay attention when it it is not thier turn will probably lose. In addition each player will probably have one or more Response cards that can be played out of turn.

Have downgraded my rating due to better games having come out.

RATING: 8
The more I play this game the more I like it. Battle outcomes are too often far beyond statistics and the piece die roll is too often really annoying. When everybody wants to fight another turn peace breaks out. That's an anticlimax experience everytime. Another point of criticism is that it's in fact a two player game: the imperials vs. the coalition with less involvement for some players.
But a fun multiplayer game it is.

RATING: 8
High degree of luck and is tough on the French with 5 players (three is optimal) but is still a favourite of mine.

The dynamic between the coalition players is always interesting and the game flows well with a minimum of fiddliness. Most of the games I have played remained competitive to the end and followed a believable model with the French dominant at first (more cards and reinforcements than anyone else) but slowly overextended as the game wore on.

Can also be very interactive depending on the hand one is dealt. Always fun.

RATING: 6.5
A decent game with some era flavor that seems to recreate historical results. The game "feels" right but has quite a bit of downtime for non phasing players. See "Napoleon in Europe" by Eagle Games for a different approach to the same subject. 5th player takes Prussia and sits b w/out anything to do for the 1st hour in our 1805 playtest. 4 Players may make for a better game?

After a long time, and a deal for the 2nd edition, I am giving the game another try.  You can thank the designer's Kutuzov for that.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
i.e. 2nd edition

Number of plays is 8 at the moment and each game after introduction was a roller-coaster ride. I haven't encountered a game before, that gives you such a narrative impression of history (praise the CDGs!). 
It is very long indeed and to really appreciate one should play it probably in more than one session. 
Warning: The luck factor tends to stir up emotions (example: French player throws 5 sixes at Trafalgar; 4 Unit Army under Yorck defends Berlin against a former 14 unit Army under Kutuzov who has lost 8 units due to one attrition-roll).

This game is crap, and almost broken IMO. I don't like the distorted time scale, so badly done than is almost impossible to have French campaigning as they did in reality.
The naval part of the game is a dicefest, and about the land combats I still have reserves.
Roles are unmbalanced not just for forces on the field, and this has some explanation, but for the very time played by each player.
Play Prussia is very very boring, for example. IMO Napoleonic games should have France versus all the others. Multiplayers nappie games will have sooner or later someone allying with France, spoiling the game.
I smile when some friend of mine says "it's very good played by three people", it says all about a five player match

Fun Napoleonic game, that plays just as good as a 2-player game as it does as a multi-player game.  Lots of screwage potential for Russia, Prussia and Austria.  The uncertainity of when the game ends due to the Peace Roll and victory conditions means any one country can win, not just France and England.

Diplomatic table and naval rules have made this game fall, imo.  I'm hoping the new edition will clean some things up.  Also, a 4 or 5 player game is quite boring to Prussia (and Austria).  It's funny, because I love Wellington, but even after repeated plays never warmed up to this one...

A very good CDG where I enjoy the balance of warfare, logistics, and diplomacy.  Best when played near its full compliment of players.  The variable end conditions can lead to unpredictable playing lengths, and there can be down time, but very enjoyable all the same.

I own the second Edition of this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This GMT card-driven strategy game is one of the few that are multi-player (another being "Sword of Rome"). It is full of Napoleonic flavor, and can be a very enjoyable experience if you are prepared to invest the time and energy to learn the nuances it contains (but make sure you use the latest edition of the ruleset).

The overall diplomatic model is intriguing and needs to be studied carefully to exploit properly. At first blush it appears that it should be "everyone against France." However, if players pursue this blindly, they may only end up making things too easy for the British.

Best played with four players (leaving Prussia to be played as a proxy); game times can be somewhat extended (5  hrs in some cases); but, with the right spirit and equally matched opponents, it can be a great game experience!

I know ... I know ... I am swimming against the current of popular opinion here. 

It is not for me. Others in my club adore it, but I avoid it. It does not feel like Napoleonic warfare to me. At times turgid like WW1 and yet sometimes too willy nilly. It is not hitting my sweet spot between playability and fun. 

In fact ... I just do not have fun playing it. Enough said I suppose.

RATING: 3
A lot of interesting ideas, but overall rather disappointing. Vaguely similar in feel to Successors, although the greater length of The Napoleonic Wars (can be 7+ hours if the game goes to 4+ turns) may be a showstopper, and in the details isn't in the same league as that excellent game. A bit of a learning curve due to the opaque rules, but pretty straightforward in the main once grasped (for a wargame). However, the more off the beaten path you go, the hazier the rules become (eg: question: France defeats Austria, which is forced into neutrality. Austria declares war on Turkey, which sides with Russia, who is still at war with France. Can France then declare war on Austria once the peace enforced by the treaty elapses? Answer: by the printed rules anyway, no.) All the different nationalities (with the possible exception of Prussia) have very distinct flavors and strategic choices. Prussia is awfully weak though, and so I suspect the ideal number of players may be 4. Also, some players are going to be rather bored much of the time, depending on how the game develops. Another fear is that like Risk before it, it may turn out to be a Kingmaking game - the players are more than able to stop any single player from winning, so it just boils down to who can sneak in for the win (and generally, the cards/events are not strong enough to base a "power play" on - most of the strong events are more "hosers" or "no-brainers" - i.e., +1VP with no downside - than cards that allow you to "build"). Overall, some good stuff, some not-so-good stuff, but fun to play in any event, at least the first handful of games. However, I don't think it's got anything on Successors. Glad I sold mine while the buzz was still strong.

Tried playing this with some experienced players.  None of them could tell me what the events on the cards were, even though the ink was practically rubbed off the counters from so much play.  No knowledge of history at all.  I really don't get the "card shark" crowd, and I don't want to.

Weird gamey mechanics like trying to end the game early via cardplay tactics. Sold.

Great game!  Because of the large number of cards and different events every game I've played has turned out differently (about 20)  Well balanced, but each nation requires it's own style.  In our group it appeals to both fans of german and war games.  Game length can vary greatly.  We've played 4 games in 4.5 hours to a 7 hour 5 turn game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I really enjoy this game - the errata have cleared up most of the rules-issues, and allthough it is necessary to look stuff up from time to time, the game flows at a reasonable tempo. All nations are fun to play, and the amount of strategy-cards ensure that no two games will be identical. Initially I didn't like the peace die-roll (you roll a die after each round - if it is a 6'er the game ends), but have come to terms with it. 
Would love to see more card-driven GMTs for more than two players.

I've got a few games under my belt.  I wish I would have had someone to teach me, the rules are really pretty simple.  I think the system and possibilities are wonderful.  Spanish troops seize Dublin, the turks assault Paris, but are repelled at the last moment by Blucher.  Yet, somehow, the game convinces you that this could have just as easily happened.  Probably my favorite Grand Strategy wargame.

Update:
Still wonderful, but only with a group that is okay with the tumult of history.

Istant Classic, good historical feeling, I know you cannot call this a simulation, but who cares!!!. You need 5 players to optimal play, on the other hand Prussia sits idle for the first turn and lots of players means 4  turns almost guaranteed I've played 35   games till now, 25 of them with 5 players. The games is fun, and long  (even if time seems to fly).You'll need a looooong afternoon or two evenings if you are planning a 5 players game. And even more if you got the slooooow opponents that I usually get.
Month after month our group always come back to this Great Game. Highly recomended.

Fun CDG playable in one or two sittings. Works also OK as a multiplayer game. A pity Nappy has not enough incentive to try to invade Russia. Invading England is usually much more easily done.
Anyway, the whole period is vividly recreated thanks to the deck of cards. Good napoleonic feel to this one.

RATING: 9
We have groups in Sterling and we play this game at least twice a month with four or five players.  The cards and combat system produce a varied game.  To win players need to cooperate against France.  In our last game I played England and the French player invaded England with Napoleon.  At first I was on the ropes but later amused at this strategy.  I boxed Napoleon in Scotland and left him there to rot while the French navy repeated was beaten back.  This allowed the Prussian and Russian to beat up on the French army.  I find it enjoyable enough to look for it on E-Bay.

From the point of view of rules, this is almost identical to Wellington. I feel that this game really needs all 5 players, otherwise the diplomatic aspects of the game can become really cumbersome.

After trying it:yes it´s better, the new changes work quite well, specially the new cards, but still it´s dissapointing... what a pity!

Then rule of peace, it´s really anticlimax and artificial...

Very uneven experience.  The French have lots to do, the Prussians have literally nothing to do for hours.  The cards are too powerful, the game can end too easily and dead generals keep coming back.  Worst of all is the all-too-common-for-GMT reams of errata.

Good fun -- lots of interaction, and plays differently for each power. Would score higher, but is rather unbalanced. Napoleonic veneer, but not very historic. Best with four players, I think. Even more luck dependent than most other CDGs -- but c'est le guerre.

RATING: 8
Fun, relatively simple multi-player version of [i]Wellington[/i], with fleets and a diplomatic element to boot. But, unlike Wellington, the battle cards are not so wildly chaotic that it will sour your gaming experience. Plus, in multi-player games, it might be everyone against France, but there can be only one victor, which provides an interesting dynamic.

The second addition offers some welcome improvements to the hand management/chaos by relegating most of the nastier cards to the discard pile once used.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Grand scope in a quick fun game (although I've had a couple of horror marathons). Rules aren't an easy read and you're unlikely to play your first few games right but it wont matter. Luck plays a large role, so be prepared to declare a winner and set it up again.
I find its best as a 3-player game since other numbers will leave people twiddling thier thumbs watching everyone else having a fun time.

RATING: 5
A mixed bag.  A relatively simple game for 2 to 5 players based on the Napoleonic Wars from 1805 onwards.  The We The People card system buys command points that can be spent on all sorts of things, builds, moves, diplomacy and so on.  The diplomacy rules are headache inducing.  While it is fun to play, it is long - around 90 minutes per turn and it could go five turns.  In the end, just not my cup of tea.

I finally played this one and frankly I am shocked that it has such a devoted following. It is very successful in compacting huge armies sweeping across europe and chasing in the high seas into a fast-playing empire game. It leans more toward unbalanced but historical player positions, so Austria is a bit of a longshot for victory. 
 
What is hard to swallow is the meshing of dusty old wargamer conventions (die modfiers, siege rolls, stacking rules, build points etc,) co-existing freewheeling elements like card-stealing, bidding cards to reduce victory, etc. The game is what it is, so just be prepared to have your well-planned march on Vienna halted  by having the card stolen or your turn pre-empted...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
  Some card-based games lack the ebb and flow of surprise, but TNW errs so far on the side of spontaneity that it&#039;s nearly epileptic.  The wild swings in hand sizes and the insane card math makes balance in any traditional sense impossible.  It has enough randomness – not at all synonymous with &quot;balance&quot; BTW – to keep every player involved for any given turn, and it can be lots of fun to play, especially in the 5-player configuration (which is the best version of the game).  As a 2-player game, there&#039;s never any point in playing a second turn, and I&#039;d rather play Russian Roulette than TNW in a tournament.
  On the other hand, the chrome is lovely.

One of the few GMT games I've ever sold.  I think this was an attempt to create an Axis & Allies game in the Napoleonic era.  The game is a CDG and I believe was the first of GMTs for every player to have nation-specific cards.  I just didn't find it really captured the era and games quickly careened into an alt-history world.  A&A has team sides, but here all sorts of bizarre alliances and wars start. It begins in late 1804 and I remember it being nigh impossible for the to French to race from Bolougne, win at Ulm and then win again against the allies at Austerlitz.  As the game is deisgned for multiple players, the French (and Napoleon) were too neutered.  Perhaps Napoleon should have a higher DRM, reflecting the Allies' historical strategy to avoid him and only engage his subordinates. I also found the whole diplomatic system wonky - special rules on minor countries and bringing them into the war, player alliances and peace settlements and terrirorial changes.  Even rules on when a conquered player nation can revolt against its conqueror.  Possibly though some of the shortcomings were fixed with the 2nd edition and I'll conclude by saying I really enjoy GMT's Wellington - which is based on the same system, but dispenses with the diplomatic and naval rules.

Strategic Napoleonic games are tough.  This is a step up from Soldier Kings, but if a level of authenticity is desired, try instead either of the old AH War & Peace or Empire in Arms.  Else for A&A style, Age of Napoleon or WG's War & Peace. There also exists Nations in Arms and Napoleon Against Europe, though I haven't played either.

I thought the game was ok. But learning the game was a real drag, as the rulebook has got to be one of the most obtuse and opaque rulebooks ever. Game length is also a little long if you push it to 4-5 turns, which is practically a must if the Coalition is going to have a shot at winning. The playability of the countries is also very uneven. A competent Prussian player can only ever win against an incompetent French player. And if France does the historical thing, does Austria even have a chance of winning? Overall, I had fun but it'll take a lot to get me to play it again.

This game has dropped in standing since more card-driven games have come onto the market, though I don't see why they can't coexist.  TNW is on the lighter side of the card-driven spectrum, and the clean mechanics allow you on real game: the multiplayer game of running amok in Europe through military, diplomacy, and intrigue.  I've always had a fun time playing this game, with its climactic battles (this is Napoleon, after all) and swings of fate.

I liked this a lot when it came out.  But now, after several plays, I always think about playing it again but always decide not to.  The rules are just too hazy and convoluted for me to go back and learn them all again.

RATING: 8
Not as elegant a system as Here I Stand, but there are some notable mechanisms. I really like how the minor powers work in this one, getting their own cards, their own home cards, their own impulse. I also like the peace roll at the end of each turn. A good game, but not as enjoyable as HiS. Possibly on the same level as Sword of Rome.

Very interesting game. I like this card system, although I prefer the one of Path of Glory. If you like Napoleonic wargames this is a must have; few rules but a lot of strategy and fun.
Just one (big) flaw; combat system is Axis and Allies style, too random. One unlucky roll may completely skrew your strategy up...

RATING: 7
A fun Multi-player CDG.  I'd like to try it again, in the 2nd edition and with a group who was really interested.

My biggest beef with it is that it isn't as good as Here I Stand, but can play with fewer players.  HIS is clearly a step or 3 better and so NW gets sent to Canada.

RATING: 6
Fun game but has a problem with victory conditions.  Its a free for all where people can change sides.  It could be everyone against France as intended but I've had it be everyone against Britain and Russia who then have 0 chance to win.

Having the game end on turn 1 sucks unless you are France.  Prussia could end up never participating in the game.

Started this one at midnight (with only one of the 5 of us knowing the rules, and one other who'd played it before)!  We finished the first turn at 3am, and 4 of us voted to reduce a card and add a die roll modifier to the end of game dieroll.  Thus the game would end on anything other than a one...thank goodness a 3!  I played England and drew for the win with Austria (who were both 2 victory points up), everyone was attacking France, and it was fun!  (except for the French player of course)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good: Strategic - Napoleonic - Easy/Medium

Plus: 
-Great theme
-One of the easier CDG's available
-Plays quickly and has great replay value
-Very Fun

Minus:
-Not as evocative as I hoped it would be (unlike Pursuit of Glory / HIS / Wilderness War)
-It will take some time to play 
-Not even close to reality but the starting point is that you are Napoleon and you decide from there where it goes. Hard to master!

General: the theme / playability / replayability factor makes this one a good game. A bit easier than POG but don't underestimate the strategic context and movement abilities as these are quite a challenge. 
It is not a good simulation as such and true, the Prussian player is quite inactive the few first turns but it is still a highly playable and enjoyable game with a group. Could have more chrome to make it more evocative but overall fun and in print.

Only played once.  Maybe we did something wrong but the incentives didn't make any damn sense to me.  The conquest rules seem to discourage capturing a capital.  And since it's a single player winner rather than an alliance we found that nations in an alliance would often root against each other.  

I would get up and leave rather than play this again.

First game with 3 players. Overall, a favourable impression. We had no problems with the rules thanks to the fact that 1 player had a few plays under his belt. Having said that, we were all very flexible in interpreting them. Play was relatively slow (3 turns totalled around 6 hours) but there was never a dull moment. I'm not sure yet how much I like the card system. The cards certainly add some spice, the concept of Home Cards helps differentiate the nations, and the size and strength of your hand does have a significant impact on your strategic options. However, the system as a whole still feels a little too random.

Mmmm - is it a two player or a five player game?  It can't be both, because it has been (allegedly) balanced at one extreme or the other, or perhaps in the middle somewhere.  Either the Coalition has inherent restrictions imposed by the system to prevent it from dominating a two-player game, or France has been detuned a bit to keep it from romping versus a four-player Coalition working at cross purposes.  The rules are also pretty furry, with notions of unit size lending a complexity out of proportion to the rest of the system - the vestiges of its original mini-based mechanics persist.  Finally, history is there, but in a big bucket to be picked out at random.  For all that, a lot of fun, and I continue to warm to it with each playing.

My main issue is there can be too much card counting going on in most games with experienced players. They should have a start rule where cards are blindly removed at the start of the game and you can't check the discards. That should even up the player field.

For a moment, I really wanted to buy this game.  Napoleonics riding on the card-driven games train.  Could have been a great subject using this kind of system.  The map looks nice and the counters look great.  The time suppression could have been a problem for this type of strategic scale game.  But I guess the use of strategy cards could have corrected the time issue.  One thing I am worried about card-driven game being applied to Napoleonics is the creation of a false sense of speed during that period.  Actually, the soldiers at that time move slow to find one great pitched battle.  The time suppression could have been a problem for this type of strategic scale game.  But I guess the use of strategy cards could have corrected the time issue.  If the designer can find the right balance on the scale of everything, this should be a great game.  (Looking for GMT reprint in coming Jun 08.  Game arrived and please refer to my comment entry at the second edition.)

RATING: 4
Overlong game that works as a multiplayer game but the resemblance to the Napoleonic wars is essentially incidental.  The political system completely fails to capture any feel of the revulsion Napoleon caused in the ruling dynasties of Europe. Likewise, the anti-French nationalist feelings that were essentially a prerequisite to any of the old regimes being able to stand up to the French after multiple failures are completely absent (well, there are a couple of cards with one-impulse effects that are sort of intended to represent this but fail).  Prussia could as easily end up in the French camp as on the other side.  Britain is not interested in a continental balance of power but in cutting out the biggest slice of real estate on the continent for itself, like any of the others.

On the military side, though the repeated historical one-or two year campaigns are possible, the game also appears to support a "perpetual war" approach where participants simply keep fighting across a featureless flow of one year after the other.  

Summary: yes, a similarity to the Napoleonic wars can be discerned, though more in the components and map than in gameplay. 

Final comment: rather funny to see War and Peace (where Europe was almost a featureless plain equally traversable in all directions) being followed by game whose map is bizarre in leaving out major trade routes and roads all across central Europe to make moves more constricted.

RATING: 6
Very fun albeit ahistorical 2-player Napoleonic game.  Not really a great 5-player game because of excessive downtime (unless you are France) and fact that it is basically two sides and not a true free-for-all.  Game length varies tremendously which adds urgency to every action but can be a negative for planning your evening - especially if you are Austria and the game ends after turn 2.

There is quite a lot going on in this game.  I actually played this after Wellington and it is clear that this game is grander in scope, because of the diplomacy track and the naval warfare.

Playing Prussia in my one and only game could have something to do with my rating.  But really, as a multi-player CDG, there are really much better options (most especially Successors).  The wildly asymmetric player nations may be historic, but is really not that interesting in actual play.

This is one thing that Age of Napoleon got right... focusing on the Nap Wars as essentially a contest between Britain (and her allies) vs France and turning it into a 2 player game.  Prussia is really unplayable, and does anyone really want to play Austria in this game?

Unlikely to play again given that Successors is just so much better.

Of all the multiplayer games that I have ever played this is the one which I prefer. 
It does require a lot of effort to learn the rules well and teach to others but it is worth it.
The fact that we keep playing this game week after week for almost four years (despite the fact that my collection of games is now over 250) indicates how fun this game can be. 
Still, this game is obviously not for everyone and it does have its problems. Yet, when the question comes about how we want to spend the evening TNW makes it to the table.

Very long, over-complex game with awful rules which are full of ambiguities.  Very boring for some of the players, since there can be down periods of a couple of hours in which they can do nothing.  Despite the complexity, the game offers a ridiculous version of history, in which the Austrians can ally with the Turks; Spain and Russia are never invaded by France; the Royal Navy can quite easily be driven from the seas and England invaded; and battles which are much too luck-driven.  (Does Don Greenwood give all his own designs a '10' rating?)

I was probably expecting too much.  This game does not match up with the other card driven games.  It lacks the tension of the others by allowing the player to use Ops points in too many ways.  It includes a combat mechanism that is too cumbersome for its worth (I have yet to see roll to hit be worth the effort).  Generic military units seal the deal and cause this game to go to the bottom of the stack.  I would play it if asked, but cannot imagine recommending it.  Try Sword of Rome instead.

As much as I don't care for Axis and Allies, there is still a mechanical simplicity to A&A that this game does not possess.

This is a difficult one. I really admire the game, especially the diplomacy/alliance track and the unique way in which each country plays. The event cards are OK, rules are fairly simple and the fact you can play it with 2-5 is a bonus. Unsure of the comabat system, which tires quickly, but the main reason I could never rate it higher is the time factor. Just too long and not enough to do for some players - the main reason I avoid multi-player wargames. For this reason, I'd gravitate towards Wellington. Even though this is a strong CDG game, I can't see myself playing it more than once a year.

There is a great group at Consim that provides quick answers for whatever rules questions occur.  Some people knock this game for &quot;down time&quot;; my group has never had that problem, as we have come to appreciate that you really need to pay attention to everything that is being done by all the players.  That warm fuzzy alliance you have this turn could be an enemy next turn!  One of my top 5 games of all time.

 I found the experience pretty dry, the play somewhat boring, and the game just did not capture an excitement I would have expected.  I am generally a GMT fan, and bigtime Napoleonics fan, but this one leaves a lot to be desired.

The game that introduced CDGs to me. Refreshingly fast after Empires in Arms. I like this game most with 3 players. I haven't taken a peek to 2nd edition.

RATING: 8
A must-have for me ... a card driven game (one of my favourite game mechanics) based around my "favourite" period of warfare.  An excellent game that, I think, captures the spirit and feel of strategic Napoleonic warfare.  The diplomatic track is an added element of the game that simulates well the wavering politics of the period.

RATING: 4
Beer&Pretzel lottery. Wheel of Fortune meets lottery with some historical flavor added on top. Ridiculous random end game condition. Players not currently winning may modify it by hurting themselves(= taking less cards next turn). Some very unhistorical elements like unlimited stacking possibility and very little attrition effects overall. This might be OK if it would Allies vs. France but selfish Coalition players will very likely ruin the game, and leave very little chance for the Austrian player. This game is nowhere near in the top league like HiS, VQ, Successors or SoR. This is actually of one the lightest, least historically accurate and the most random multi-player CDGs that I have played so far.

RATING: 9.5
Great game for 2-5 players.  I think it works best with 4, but will do for 3 in a pinch.  Yes, it is heavily luck dependant, but it is freewheeling and fun.  I've played it over 75 times, so you know where I stand.

This is the best Napoleonic War game my group has come across in years. We made the comparision against Age of Napoleon (Phalanx Games), Napoleon in Europe (Eagles Games) and Empire at Arms. The game is fast and intense. Of course many details were sacrificed for the sake of playability but we agreed that the trade-offs were well considered.

RATING: 9
This game is one of the best games created in the last 10 years.  An amazing effort giving the asymmetric nature between all the sides and the fact that the game plays well as a 2-player, 3-player, 4-player, and 5-player game.  It is probably the best 3-player game I can think of and offers tremendous re-playability as each game is different from the next.

Update:  Downgraded my score because I liked the original version better than the second edition.

I never got the excitement over this game.  The diplomacy rules are overwrought, the combat model is boring and the events bear only the faintest resemblance to the history the game is supposedly modeling.  I think this is by far the worst of the major CDG game systems, but clearly I am in the minority.

Finding not only one but two or more additional players will be difficult outside of a convention. Still, the rules are fantastic and I (for now) imagine that it would be a blast to play in a group.

RATING: 8
The 90  unique cards insure that every game is different. There are a lot of rules and errata to absorb, but it's worth it! IMO plays best with 3. Diplomatic dyanamics are best with 5, but Prussia usually has a lot of down time. The 2nd edition rules look very promising.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
In a 4/5 player game if you aren't playing France then don't bother.  Like Fortress America, this game only works as a 2 player game.

In 2 player it is still so luck driven that I don't find it enjoyable, as well as being extremly long for the type of game.  Players are better off playing Risk or Shogun.

RATING: 7
Great looking game,but the rules are shaky and not explain well,the flow of play is jerky,it doesn't flow smoothly;sad this could have been a great game,and in someways still not bad;the reason I give it so high as a 7 is because of its scope and looks.

RATING: 6.5
Fun and (potentially) quick multiplayer CDG. Counter density is fairly low and the game has several interesting elements including balancing helping other nations beat down France but still trying to soar ahead by capturing key cities.

Forget playing with 5 as the Prussian player does nothing the first turn. The event cards are fairly interesting. But my gripe is the agony if the game goes on the full way...it will be long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only played once.  I had a bad experience with it, but there's a lot of history there.  It probably plays best as a two or four player game.  The Prussia player seemed to be superfluous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Had the unfortunate experience of playing Austria in this game. After the initial blows, Austria sits around doing little with no hand and waiting for other people hours on end. That's just plain bad design. It might be more fun playing another of the major powers, but I would not wish to inflict the experience of playing Austria on anyone else. Prussia too seems to be mostly spectating the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Ain't she a beaut.  This is really a great design.  This takes all of the elements of previous card games and finds a way to make every element accessible and usable.  It is clean and fluid and every card play is tough.  Of course you want the ops, but the events are just so good.  Perhaps not as stressful as Paths of Glory, but certainly right up there with offering great decisions while conveying the lovely chrome of history.

One of the best multiplayer war games I've played. Although I'd never play it with anything other than three.

RATING: 6
I understand why so many like it, had I not played Here I Stand before it it'd stand out more.

I like the diplomacy track for the minor powers, but feel courting them should be handled differently.  I feel an opportunity was missed to make card play more dynamic with very little rules overhead, perhaps another number or symbol on the cards separate from it's CP value creating difficult choices (do I use this weak card for CP's I need now or for it's powerful influence on Sweden's diplomacy track which I may need in the future).

I don't like that the game starts in 1805, the French decide between it's two choices while the coalition goes though the motions.  The game can easily end before any player had to make a hard decision as generic strategies play themselves out.

I'd be willing to revisit my rating.

RATING: 6.5
Good game if you don't want simulate history,also in a multiplayer game play Prussian may be very boring, another problem is the way the battle is resolved.
Too much random and influenced by lucky (similar to axis and allies).
In other parts the game is fun, but fail to reach the scope.
Good to play when you want take a breath before starting an historichal napoleonic game

RATING: 10
Good game with plenty of replay value. I've played this game over 100 times and I've had alot of fun. Though, at this point, there is a pattern that's developed. 

I love CDGs and this one is about perfect. I enjoyed the battle and responds cards and the wide range of outcomes during a battle. It's more exciting than a CRT. I don't like the ability of being able to telegraph casualties by a limited possibility of lose on a CRT.  

As for some criticism posted here for this game... I don't know how rolling one 6 sided dice and consulting a CRT has more of a Napoleonic feel then what is presented in this game. Morale and Leadership is represent by dice and the cards. Which shouldn't be suprising in a CDG

Fantastic game and system! Cards make replayability certain while playing time can be kept down by those familiar with the mechanics.

This is the most enjoyable wargame I own from a pure "fun" standpoint.  I'll play it most anytime.  However, unlike most people who like this game, I don't really care for it multi-player.  I love it as a two-player game, though.    See my review here on BGG.

RATING: 6
In The Napoleonic Wars, GMT Games brings you a fast-paced, tension-filled, card-driven wargame with a point-to-point movement system that pushes the envelope in a new direction for a pivotal period of history. Rooted soundly in Mark Herman's award-winning We The People system, The Napoleonic Wars provides refinements that allow two-to-five players to play an exciting game requiring two to ten hours. The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the "end of the world" phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.

Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting. Uncontrolled powers are governed by a diplomatic track which is also affected by play of command points and events.

One of my most-played games from 2000-2005.  If we had a group of four and an afternoon to devote to gaming, this is what we'd pull out 80% of the time.  This would be my favorite game if Here I Stand didn't exist.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good, but overshadowed in my mind by its younger cousin [gameid=17392].  Where Here I Stand introduces cool political and religious bells and whistles to the multiplayer card-driven genre, The Napoleonic Wars focuses almost exclusively on the combat.  The singlemindedness is appropriate for the time period, but for me takes a little bit of the shine off.  TNW does have some things going for it, such as the ability to switch sides easily and freely, and plenty of opportunity to exploit tactical advantage, and even the simple joy of just killing stuff.  Probably worth looking into if you really love the back and forth politics and the sweeping campaigns of the period, but I'll stick with the theme and uniqueness of Here I Stand.

RATING: 10
The most playable and variable of all card driven games so far, IMO. 

Best for 3 players. Nearly as good for 2 or 4. 
I just don't wanna play it as a 5-player game anymore, since Prussia - as a major nation - has too much influence on the game balance. 

The 2ed is even better than the 1ed (which was good enough for 80 plays).   

Until 2009-02-06: 95 plays (1ed + 2ed)

Ambitious game to be a multi-player, card-driven wargame. Moderate complexity, but requires the players to really work together early to prevent France from running away with the game. Like many wargames, requires strong knowledge of the rules (and likely access to the lengthy FAQ and errata). If you can digest all those rules and find the right players, though, it's an awfully fun game.

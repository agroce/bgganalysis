RATING: 8
Really enjoyed the streamlined play.  Gave a slight 18xx feel, but it is still very approachable to most players.  Game is teachable in 15 mins which is fantastic.  Choices are there but there is a good amount of luck to the game.

Quite enjoyable overall.

Note: Rules are ambiguous about market cards.  Make sure to print FAQ.

RATING: 3
Tedious crap. No dramatic arc whatsoever. The development of ships only makes the game longer. It would have been better if the ship upgrades and mines evolved making the game a race for something. Now you're just running in circles making the same deliveries over and over again. Furthermore, there are virtually no trade-offs to ponder about. Walking through a door does not make others to close to you.

RATING: 5
Various interlocking design problems. There won't be much repeat play value in something this formulaic and processional, but there's no way back from a trailing position, AND any disadvantage suffered by a player at the start will magnify as the game progresses and additionally give away a similar advantage to opponents. I would not advise carrying on a first game, but restarting after both rules and the nature of the game are more fully understood.

RATING: 6
A game built around the 18xx mechanism of trains (here space ships) getting progressively  better, while older models rust.  Is there enough of a game otherwise?  I don't quite think so. The four quadrant board, with different actions possible in each works rather nicely, as do the pilots and bits of gear that improve your ship's performance.  There are, of course, timing issues, but generally speaking it seems best to push the pace as hard as possible and inflict unproductive voyages on others as their ships go obsolete.  Not unlike many 18xx games, Space Merchants can go on a bit, and quite repetitively at that.

The artwork is functional and production quality is good.  The rules are vague and poorly organised.  Do download the FAQ and card clarifications.

Nice economic pick-up and deliver game with a sci-fi theme. Rulebook is badly written but in reality the game is easy to teach. The whole board is actually a bid rondel with 4 spaces. In each space you can do a different action. The game flows quickly and has a lot of minor little decisions. I think it lasts a bit more that it should. It has some random elements (tiles drawn from a bag) so it is more of a gateway economic game.

Rule book left a little to be desired.  Shardes of RftG in game timing and feel.  Development options with obsolesence.  For space mini rondel, build ship, equip, seach and sell.

Starship Merchants is the distilled essence of a 18XX game: there is no map but, still, an operative pick-up and deliver part of the game exists; besides you have the core of an investment game, including the element of locomotiv... ehm, starship obsolescence.
There's also some random elements in form of market and destination cards that are not going to appeal to hardcore 18XX fans, but the game is quite good and can be a great introduction to the classic 18XX titles for players that, like me, have only scratched the very surface of the genre.

Great props for the production value and artwork: the components are top notch, and the illustrations, reminiscent of classic hard science fiction, are wonderful.

Slops to the rulebook: it is short and concise, but lacks cards explanation and is not crystal clear on a couple of points.

I personally love this game. The concept is fantastic. But I feel that it definitely needed more play testing before it went to production. Despite that I still have tons of fun playing it. The rondel part is maybe the bit that I question the most, it almost doesn't make sense to buy multiple ships because then you make fewer laps and make money slower.

Strips away all the tedious chrome of Merchants of Venus and leaves intact all the fun that game ever had in half the time or less. 

Players move their token around a board composed of just four spaces. Three of the spaces break the decision-making down to basically 1) What ship do I want to buy? 2)What "kit" do I want to maximize mining opportunities? and 3) What resources (Ice Dice, French Fries, or Bucky Balls) do I want and where do I want to take them? The fourth space is pay-out for all the previously made decisions. 

The fun is in the decisions you make that maximize your own profits while messing with the plans others as efficiently and quickly as possible. A euro gamer's dream!

A good introduction to 18XX, but given the amount of time to play (~2 hours) and the lack of track laying or a stock market, it's not one I have any need for in my collection.  That said, the ability to customize your spaceships (companies) with all sorts of special things was neat.  I'd ply it again but wouldn't ask to.   It does make me wonder how something like this could be incorporated into an 18XX game.

Can't wait to try playing it with the right rules! Be sure to check the FAQ here from Toy Vault.  The main rules I was taught incorrectly (and then passed on oops) were:  destinations are optional, only one turn per ship in the asteroid belt, cannot buy a claim your first turn in the market as your starting goods are not in your 'local space' yet.  Fun game that I'm discovering more to like with each play.

I got this as it is an unusual take on pick-up-and-deliver, a mechanic I am drawn to.  What makes it unique is that there is no geography!  The picking up and delivering is all abstracted.  There are only four spaces on the game board; it is basically a large rondel.  You can buy ships, outfit the ships, pick-up ores ("search deep space"), and drop them off.  The mechanics are very simple, and the game shares some aspects of the 18xx - for instance, there are a limited number of ships which must be bought in order, and buying a new "tier" of ship might take older ships out of circulation.  The abstracted ore delivery is also very 18xx like in its mathy nature, as you are often making only small improvements over time in the value of goods taken and sold (although true 18xx can never be abstracted, as terrain and geography are what set one game apart from another).  So far it seems to work well with 2, and Ashar likes it.  I enjoy it, but am unsure as to how much staying power it has - like the 18xx, it is a game where early decisions have many ramifications later, to the point where you could screw yourself out of contention early on (although since there is little player interaction this is probably even less the case than in a game of Power Grid, although this shares some of that game's opacity).  Time will tell, but it's a clever mash-up.

Really nice distillation of 2038 into something playable. Gets at a lot of the interest without the gargantuan playing time. One of the best "minimalist" 18xx games so far.

You won't get a 4-player game done in the 90 minutes advertised on the box, though. Figure 2 hours, at least. Does play well with 2 or 3 though.

I don't know exactly how much replay value there is on offer here, but still, definitely recommended for fans of 2038 who just can't find the 12 hours or so required to play the classic.

Excellent business game. Buy ships, pick up and deliver goods. Modify ships for better pick up and delivery. Get the right pilots, refineries and locations for massive points. All wrapped up in a very intuitive and easy to learn game with some timing strategies.

Not bad but rather repetitive efficiency engine game. There is quite a lot of randomness and not enough destination cards. Whilst there is some interaction it is mostly through stealing resources from other players or clearing out cards that would have benefited them. All the rusting space ships just made me want to try an 18XX again instead.

Its a decent game, but with too ambitious of a goal. The notion of a shorter, 18xx-cousin game that plays more like a Euro and in a short time....with the space theme. Well, I love that idea.

But the game doesn't provide enough interesting decisions for the players. Because of the turn track (the 4 areas) its harder to really do anything surprising or even very interesting. I enjoyed this one for a few plays and then I started to find it repetitive and heading towards dull. Still its inexpensive enough that its probably worth the few plays of discovery. It makes me want to play 2038.

Starship Merchants is fundamentally an economic game centred on collecting commodities as efficiently as possible from space and maximizing their value when they're sold in port.

Each player represents a space mining conglomorate, over the course of the game players will buy spaceships (that can rust 18XX style), upgrade them with bling and captains, and then spend time out making contacts with local miners.

In short, ships come in two major flavours, tugs (high capacity) and scouts (high speed). As in most games of this type, players want the ability to carry a lot of things back (tug) but also the ability to find good things more efficiently (scout). The resources are tiles that are gathered by random bag pulls, but there are only three types of goods and in general you have a decent amount of ability to specialize if that's what you want to do.

The game is generally solid throughout, though there aren't any moments that partciularly stand out either. It's more about slowly grinding out incremental economic advantages by investing in your infrastructure to make given commodities more valuable to you than your competitors. There is some interaction, but little of it is direct aside from the ability to rust out ships when the first Mark III and Mark IV ships are sold. It is possible to take unclaimed resources from in front of players, but it is expensive enough to make it only really regularly viable if you have the special captain card (one of many in the game) that decreases the cost.

At the end of the day, it's a solid enough game that I would play with an experienced group, but it's probably about 30-45 minutes too long for what it offers me. The random nature of the special tiles (what's available cycles quickly and can matter a great deal) and bag draws (more controllable) also makes it appeal less than a short 18XX or something like Lokomotive Werks to me.

Had never heard of this until the host of our group broke it out tonight. Space isn't really our (wife and me) theme, but we were willing to give it a go. It seemed very simple at first glance, but as the turns went by and players (we played w/ a game of 4 players) bought more ships, the strategy came to the surface.

It was enjoyable, but not something we'd ever be jonesing to play. That said, we'd be willing to play it again, just wouldn't be a game we would own.

If you think you might want to learn 18xx, it wouldn't be a bad idea to play Starship Merchants a few times.  It includes some of the elements that are hardest to learn in 18xx (because in 18xx games they are mixed in with other things that tend to distract you.)

Starship Merchants isn't an 18xx game but it is built around one of the central ideas of the family, the train rush: old ships get decomissioned when a sufficiently new generation hits the market.

The rest of the game is fairly different. One of the few commonalities is the strong emphasis on timing although here it is caused primarily by the rondel mechanic, not so much by the sense of urgently needing to accomplish something before somebody else gets there.

While individual turns are usually very short, the game as a whole takes rather long (though I don't doubt you can get the time down with some experience) and gets a little repetitive. There is little sense of progression beyond the most simple equation of bigger holds and thus bigger gains at the end of a run. There is also very little variance. Sometimes special missions provide a little sugar-coating on top but the bulk of your turn can usually be calculated ahead of time, and I suspect that only becomes more pronounced with fewer players. What it comes down to then, is - slightly exaggerated - little more than a dressed-up maths exercise.

A surprisingly light game of economics and tempo that is quite clearly inspired by 18xx, and 2038 specifically. The design goals appear to be the transplantation of 18xx ideas into a format that is friendlier, lighter, and more variable. The last of those three factors is especially central here, and it's where the connection to 2038 is most apparent (other than the obvious thematic similarity). I would say that the design goals have been mostly achieved, if I have interpreted them correctly.

Although the 18xx relation is unmistakeable, there are at least three *huge* departures from 18xx that must be mentioned, and that make Starship Merchants a completely different beast from anything in that family of games. 

(1) There is no ability to invest in other players' business activities, to shift ownership of your company, or to manage any sort of stock prices or portfolios. This is the very heart of 1830 and many other 18xx games, but Starship Merchants has stripped it out in order to focus on other things.

(2) The entire spatial/geographical element of 18xx is handled abstractly. Starships have energy points, and the accessibility of resources (mines) and destinations (planets) is measured by different levels of proximity to the player.

(3) The set of starships available to be purchased is the only fully known market or commodity in the game. Everything else is handled by random card draws and token draws. The availability of this stuff is very unpredictable, but a certain amount of it can be incorporated into your future plans once you actually manage to find it.

So you can see that the game design has traveled quite some distance from the 18xx family. The 18xx origins are most apparent in the pacing aspects of the game, which are the focus and the heart of Starship Merchants: investment in starships (by purchase or lease), obsolescence of starships, efficiency of turns, and timing your business decisions in terms of number of starships, using one starship to pave the way for another, proximity to other players within the business cycle, and predicting the end of the game.

I did think the game played a little long for its punching weight. It probably needs to be this long, though, because it's essential to the design to allow enough for different pacing strategies to pay off. Currently rates a 7, pending further play. The extra length may have simply been a first play phenomenon. The other question that must be answered is whether the game has been stripped down too far. Is there enough here to remain interesting over the course of several plays? We'll see.

[b][UPDATE][/b] This is excellent as a two-player game. The game moves very quickly, and you have more ability to set up favorable opportunities. I don't think I'll play again with four after seeing how much better is was with two. Rating raised to 8.

Played in the learning area at Unity games. The teacher was one of the designers, so the rules explanation was really good. I made some mistakes early on that I couldn't recover from, so the second half of the game was kind of a drag. It took me a few rounds to understand how ship runs in the mining section worked. I suspect that the end game will often bog down in some analysis paralysis as players make mental calculations to maximize their final actions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a pure economic game, where the board serves only to keep the cards organized and to show where each player is in the cycle of actions. The players buy spaceships, buy equipment and the occasional pilot, take minerals, and then sell those minerals to buy more ships and equipment. There is a race for newer, better and more expensive ships that force all the players to discard older ones. So, the cycle continues until the best ships are bought, and only then players start to make some real profit, which ends the game in two or three more "laps" around the board - or at least that has been my experience in four plays. I enjoyed them, but the first games lasted over three hours, with just two players, and the last one was around two and a half hours, still too long.

It is basically a game of efficiency, where the hardest decision is to get a ship with more energy or more cargo capacity. There are quite a few random elements, which seem small but, I suspect, may be decisive in the long run. Another problem is the awkward endgame timing that may determine the winner with the "final run" rules. Even so, the game works, but I feel that I'm already done with it.

I do like pickup and deliver games, but this has some flaws that I can't ignore:
1) Deliver the same mine several times.
2) The Mark system with ships make no sense. Sometimes you can't buy more ships because someone else needs to buy ships first and they don't. And if you leave the shipyard and other players buys ships that make yours obsolete, you suddenly can't use them on the trip you're already on.

RATING: 7.5
Starship Merchants is an inexpensive re-launch of the Train Advancement/Rusting rules from the 18XX series into a Space milieu, with cards and mine/ore tokens simulating a pickup/deliver portion like other train games, but without rail-laying or stock market interaction.

Sounds a little dry doesn't it? But it's not, really, because there's actually a lot of interesting play in the timing of even just that portion of 18XX, the timing and management of mines, and trying to optimize end delivery points for maximum payouts, in order to build the right ships at the right times, and not spend one credit more on engine-building than is necessary because money = VP.

There's a little room for interactive 'claim-jumping', but often it is most profitable to optimize the payout of one's own mines and leave others' be.

Again there is interaction when players rust out other engines, and that alone can put the brakes on a leader if they are not prepared for it.

This is a thought-provoking game of timing, and a little luck in card order/mine draws, and in watching your opponents and even trying to get in their way in order to maximize your profits.

Perhaps the economic focus scares some players off, but this is a nice little condensation of a mechanic, a theme, and some simplified play to create a nice little game that won't take you 5+ hours to play.

In a way it's similar to Winsome's Lokomotive Werks, which focuses on the same 18XX mechanic but with some different actions around selling trains/starships for profit and managing supply/demand.

If you are a train gamer, you ought to try this one out, because both Winsome and Toy Vault have put out nice games that won't break your bank budget, and will entertain you with a thoughtful economic contest that doesn't take all day to play. (In fact, I find I like this implementation a little better than Winsome's, though both are nice games.)

I've rated this a 7.5 after a couple of plays, and I think it deserves more respect than it has gotten (though it's current 6.96 isn't shabby).

If you like economic/train games, this underrated game can be picked up at a steal price, and it will offer some faster, fun play.

With Tom Lehmann and Joseph Huber steering the spaceship, this game offers solid (if not star-shimmering) quality and solid play.

A fairly light pickup-and-deliver game although you'll definitely need the included player aids first time through. There are plenty of holes in the rather vague rules so be sure to print both the FAQ and the Card Clarification document. This is really an 18xx derivative, but sadly, as supplied there's only one strategy (tugs+cobalt+refineries). I generally leave out the cheap cobalt refinery to balance the game a bit better. It's fun to play and a great way to get an 18xx fix in an approachable Euro package, but the presentation could have been improved upon.

Pick-up-and-deliver game in space, where the aim of the game is to buy spaceships in order to transport goods to turn a profit.¨

The game centres around "business cycles", meaning the game consists of 4 main actions which you repeat in a cycle for the duration of the game until someone hits a certain amount of money.  This mechanic proved unpopular among some people I played with, but I quite like it as repeating the same cycle over and over gives you a clear sense of how you're performing round-on-round.  I can see how it can get tedious in long games, however.

I love the theme of this game, it's been given a kind of wacky and funny twist that works really well, but the game itself is very robust and thinky.  The ships have stats, there are upgrades available, the resources provide varying levels of profit - so there are many things to think about when trying to min/max this game.

There are some problems with it though...The rules are poorly written, this has necessitated the production of an online FAQ which is required reading before playing.  The resources have a fairly wide range of values, and they are randomly drawn which means one player could get unlucky and lose on this basis which seems unfair in an otherwise strictly strategic game.  Purchasing the ships can sometimes break down as no player wants to buy the last one in the current class and open up the better ships for the next player.  As pointed out by a friend, there are very little consequences to your actions and there is no "closing of doors" for picking certain paths.

All of the negatives are just enough for me to not want to keep this game, it's not terrible but I just don't think it has quite enough to keep me interested.

Starship Merchants is a surprisingly succesful extraction of 18xx's train rush mechanism to a full-blown game. It's a tough game as wrong timing of spaceship purchases will take you out of the game without any chances for recovery. Our first game saw wildly differing final scores. Principally, players have only one decision to take when it's their turn which mostly could be planned for. A fine game if players are prepared and attentive. The game suffers when it's extended by slow players to a duration of 3 hours as in our case. Many turns are just going through the motions of a pre-set-strategy and there's not enough to think about for such a long time when your own moves are done in a few seconds.

RATING: 4
A solid looking economic system built around a 18xx-style train obsoletion cycle.

The graphics design is absolutely substandard. The flavor graphics themselves aren't bad (though nothing special either), but they take up 90% of the cards. As a result the text tends to be lilliputian. Then to add insult to the injury, a lot of the important information (both text and icons) is printed with horrible contrast (with some drop shadows for extra fuzziness).

I'd like to give the game a higher rating since I enjoyed it in a mechanical sense, and would like to try it again. But I'd also like to give it a lower rating due to the graphics design making gameplay such a chore. This is an uncomfortable compromise.

Tough game to rate as I enjoy many of its mechanisms.  I like the rusting of the starships and the loading of goods etc.  in my first game a turn order problem seemed to make the endgame very deterministic.  I would like a mechanic that allows one to pay $ to bypass areas on the "rondel" as it was players could predict their endgame with almost perfect information and use that info to time their final ship purchases etc.

There's nothing really bad about this game. Much like Power Grid: Factory Manager you have a straight economic engine building game. It's the finer timing points and tweaks that win or lose you the game and there is enough game here that you could spend time teasing out those details. The issue I have is that there is SO much that's obvious that I lose interest and I'm ready for the game to end. 

The game is also artificially close. Unless someone is playing VERY poorly your games will certainly be won by a close margin.

This is a really well crafted game, with an interesting theme, witha core set of mechanics that I just don't like that much.

It's a pick-up-and-deliver game with spaceship purchasing, obsolescence  technologies, pilots, mining claims, etc, but at it's core it's an economic pick-up-and-deliver game like some railroad games, and even though I like the idea of that kind of game, I don't find myself that fond of them in actual play.

There do seem to be a variety of reasonable strategies and cool options, and interesting tempo aspects to the game.  The total scale of the end game compared to the cost of ships makes the game feel even more about precision timing, and less about the strategies chosen.  This is, again, a less favored style of game for me.

I've played this twice (4p each time), and my capsule description is [thing=816]2038[/thing]-the-card-game. 

There's more luck here than in 2038, though -- not just lucky bag draws for mines, but luck in what pilots, equipment, and destination bonuses come up when you need them. 

There's also a lot of long-term strategy choices -- when do you go into debt to buy ships?  How many ships of each rank do you try to get? (The ship rusting, of course, is driven by other players' choices, so people can try to beat up on a runaway leader, or choose to try to slow the game down.) 

The mix of luck and strategy, the game length, and the long-term effects of early choices, don't quite work for me in a game of this length. 

I'd be curious to see how this plays out as a 2p game, but we don't play a lot of 2p games in my circles so I'm unlikely to get a chance to try.

Love it. Works very well with two, great artwork on the board and equipment, pilot, and destination cards. I wish there were more of the latter, as that deck gets cycled through fairly quickly.

The game hinges on two important timing issues: the mid-game obsolescence of ships and endgame final run trigger-point. Success in the game largely depends on handling those critical junctures well.

The pick-up-and-deliver aspect of the game is distilled down to a single move from Belt to Dock, so one might miss the flavor and sense of a journey. Of course such streamlining was a deliberate design choice, and definitely speeds up play—I'll take that trade-off gladly. [7 plays]

Simple economic pick and deliver game that could have had sucess thanks to its streamlined mechanics, but IMHO, it has important design flaws:

-> Initial distribution of mines can be very uneven: you can have as low as 4 or as high as 12.

-> Being first brings a huge benefit that is not compensated in any way. In my first game, I arrived at the docks at the same turn the first player declared the endgame. He got the 10 points bonus because he was first, and he got one +5 points bonus more than me because the last player to arrive was between him and me. That is, in this game, being first reported 15 points for him (I won with 140 points, 15 points is more than 10%!!!). +10% points + the obvious benefits of being first (first pick at things, chance to steal mines on first turns, chance to protect his mines on first turns if he doesn't delay, etc...) is a HUGE benefit.

-> Obsolescense mechanism can be a huge random factor: if your ships become useless just before loading them in the belt, you will suffer a huge blow. And the game doesn't offer you lots of chances to predict when obsolescence will occur, abnd even if you do, you cannot do much to alter your optimal business routine (you will lose much money if you do).

-> The endgame mechanic is broken: the player that declares endgame gets 10 point bonus +5 per aditional turn. A business cycle with a Mark III ship (the minimum you can have) takes 4 turns, and provides around 45-50 points of trade return. In the best case scenario, the endgame declarer will get 30 points and his rival around 47 (more than 50% more). And if he has 2 ships (or a Mark IV ship), the difference would be huge!! Again, the game doesn't offer alternatives to control this: going away from your optimal trade cycle will cost you dearly. This means that player will strive not to declare the endgame until they are forced to do so when they have 150+ points. Ideally, a player will try to manipulate mine captures to arrive at the docks with 149 and be able to do another cycle, but so will his rivals, producing an ridiculous situation.

Between 2 players with a similar skill level, chances are one of these will decide the winner.

18xx-lite (ish). It's got the train rush, but the ships aren't too painfully expensive. Some of the cards (crew in particular) seem overpowered if you get them early. I like the refineries in that their scarcity kicks in at a point where they are difficult to afford.

The buying 'on credit' mechanic is clever, I still haven't figured out when you should do it :S

The arithmetic gets fiddly towards the end, as you're trying to count energy points and maximise income with probably 2 ships, which involves adding up lots of small numbers with two layers of bonuses in several permutations. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Once you get into it, it's easy to see the 18xx / Poseidon mold stamped over it, with a thin starship theme facade veneer, but with all the share trading stripped away leaving its operational core. Buy a ship, buy improvements, load it up with goods, earn money, buy another ship, buy more improvements, load it up with goods, earn more money, etc, etc, etc. Keep going until someone gets $100. As ships continue getting bought, the initial ones will become obsolete, which will force people to spend their money to buy more ships. There's some interest in whether you want to spend turns building souped up ships, or save those turns and spend them doing more runs, but making less money each run. In essence, determining the most efficient way to make money. There's a bunch of luck in what improvements are available to you on a turn, what goods you draw, and what bonus payments for delivery will be available. All of which will probably decide the winner. Lots of players will hate the obsolescence thing though, as when that triggers, and who triggers it, can also decide the game and you may have little say in it. In the end, you decide when to stop improving your ships and when just to make runs and make money ... so note carefully when others decide the same and go with the flow. And hope you didn't mistime it, that being the other critical factor!

RATING: 7
Starship Merchants is a game about economic efficiency.  You move your pawn to the four quadrants of the board, in order, buying ships and equipment and picking up and selling goods.  You can spend more turns at any one quadrant, hopefully earning better payoffs without spending too much time doing so.  The game is all about deciding how much to invest, both in time and money, to try to be the first to reach the game-ending threshold of cash.

I don't know how else to describe this game other than "fine". It's not spectacular, it's not shitty, it's just fine. It's touted as 18xx light, but that's kind of a stretch. It's basically a pick up and deliver to an abstract destination and keeping your ships from obsoleting. No rusting in this one which makes it more gentle. Cards and components are solid and the game goes relatively quick. I'd like to try this with more than 2 players as I think 3 is probably the sweet spot and 4 being perfectly fine. The first one to $100+ wins or at least triggers the end of the game.

For what I paid for it, I've gotten my moneys worth and I like to break it out every now and again, but it's not one I'm reaching for on first thought.

A great gamers game with some 18xx features.

(Spaceship types, availability and obsolescence is like 18xx trains.  But there is no route building, no shares and no stock market.  So this game only uses about 20% of 18xx rules/game mechanics; and then it successfully adds a lot of its own rules to make a great development and trading game.)

This game plays fast, in less than a quarter of the time compared with typical 18xx games.

First game had some debate about some cards and rules that were not too clear, but it is well worth playing.  (Need to use rule clarifications from toyvaultinc to ensure correct game play.)

I've only played this three times so far, over roughly a 2-year period. I'd rarely if ever request it - I'm not a fan of pure economic games like this one, it's a little "dry" for my taste - but this is actually quite an interesting game in the way it introduces several disparate "euro-style" mechanics into what at first seems an exercise in simply increasing your profits by buying better stuff. There is the basic "rondel"-style mechanic, where the actions you can perform depends on where you are, and a nice "action point" system for when you actually run your ships, often forcing you to choose between taking good "destinations" for bonus money and filling all your cargo holds (particularly as you can "steal" cargo from an opponent, but at a high action cost) - or indeed trying to do it all, but costing yourself a turn. All in all this isn't really the sort of game I'd want to play that often, but it's probably the best game I've played of this general type - what all those tedious 18xx games (which I've been forced to play several of, and which apparently this game is often compared to) really should be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pick up and deliver reduced to fundamentals resulting in a game that rewards efficiency.  In our first game, one player did capitalize on Ice-9 claims and refineries but the rest of us were too focused on our own goods rather than trying to maximize our position relative to others.  Game offers various options, the key is which are the most efficient to generating revenue to win at game's end.  Overdoing a ship lease, mis-timing obsolesence, spending on gear that doesn't pay back can all add to inefficiencies and loss of income.

Our game went smoothly because we had read the FAQ and Card Clarifications prior to play.  The rule book itself is horrid and not enough to learn the game.

--Jul2012-- It's a cool thing.  There's some randomness - but not enough to overwhelm any good play:  instead, there's a bunch of (apparently? actually? - that determination needs further play) subtle timing and leverage questions that the players need to answer.  I found it quite entertaining, even if I played rather poorly.

Deeper-than-it-looks (?) 18XX abstraction without shares or tracks, just cargo-carrying starships, a balance of different strategies for gaining the most income from that cargo, and the key, forced obsolescence (rusting).

I'm sensitive to the argument that the random elements are egregious. The rulebook is dreadful and the components are difficult to read from across the table so early plays are going to run long. It's got a lot counted against it.

On the other hand, it's a cever design, and the randomness does force a divergence of strategies if players want to remain competitive. It's less fluffy than it looks, and for now I'm interested in playing it more -- at least until I understand it better. I expect my rating to decline with experience.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Economic game set in space with many principles derived from the 18xx series. Players control a company who's aim is to explore for mines in space, acquire them and then sell them for profit. The board comprises of four areas, the shipyard where vessels are purchased (these become obsolete as more powerful ships come into play in true 18xx fashion), the market where upgrades for ships are purchased, the belt where ships are run attempting to acquire mines in order to sell, and finally the dock where the aforementioned mines are eventually sold. Play consists of ships going around the four areas attempting to amass in excess of 100+ credits in order to win. 'Starship Merchants' is a tight game that flows very well as players seem to progress at similar rates meaning that it can be small decisions that effect the final outcome. The game is rather condensed and requires a certain amount of abstraction to achieve this, which detracts from the theme somewhat, but it's a solid enough experience.

A gem of the 18xx series. Tom Lehmann has now provided 2 of the classics for this genre. 2038 and Starship Merchants. Starship Merchants takes about 2 hours for people that are familiar with the 18xx series (familiar does not mean experts). It has a all the elements of an 18xx without the map and without any stock market. It is fast and furious, simple and intelligent, a lot of decisions, and the outcome is always a nail biting experience. There are a lot of paths to victory and none of them can be a dominant one because it all depends on what the other players do. Go and get your copy now, and if you like what you see, go and track a copy of 2038. 2038 is more complex, it has a map, and it has a stock market. 2038 is one my favorite games, but it looks that Starship Merchants maybe a better version of this style of game. Someone needs to republish 2038 and improve and clarify the rules. Starship Merchants does not get a 10, because there were some printing errors, some rules were not clear, the game does not provide energy cubes so you can easily keep track how you spend your ship's energy, etc. Tom Lehamann has provided the clarifications here in BGG and is doing a great job to answer questions (along with other people here in BGG).

An ok game.  A lot of the game happens at the extreme margin - what tiles do you draw? do you buy or lease?  Lots of very little decisions that have very little incremental effects. 

I felt like I played for a long time making very tiny decisions that ultimately ended up in a small margin of victory for someone.  Seems too long for the size of the decisions.

One concern I do have is that there seems to be almost a disincentive to end the game.  Better to get one more run around the business cycle than to end the game.

Interesting pickup and deliver game.  Takes a bit longer than you might imagine from reading the rules.  Endgame seems tricky.  My plays were two completely different conclusions and one play that went to about 2/3 finished and had to abort due to time.  Would definitely play again.  More of a brain-burner than I expected it to be.

After 3rd complete play with a thoroughly different resolution, I'm sold.  Don't be deceived by those who call this purely a pickup and deliver as I do above.  There are some tricky calls to make here.

GAME: Catacombs (third edition)
RANK: 724
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game, but is incredibly unbalanced against the players (heroes). Have never won with the standard rules. Poison is way over powered, and feels like it wasn't play tested enough in development. Needs some house rules to make it reasonable. Usually the group gets to the room before the final room and knows they have lost. Not the best feeling when the players say "We're going to lose, can we just play something else now?"

Definitely a step up from the original in terms of production (though the cardboard is pretty flimsy.)  The core game is such a great concept, but I find that it still takes too long and the rules are terrible - way too much time spent figuring out what happens when certain situations occur.  This game should take an hour and it seems to take 3.

I still haven't had a chance to play a hero. Can't tell if unbalanced or if I'm just a flicking master. Still a lot of fun though.

In most ways, this is an excellent upgrade to the original game. Love the new boards and the new art. 

My only quibbles are that the balance seemed a little better in the original game, and the modular and icon based design direction has led to some changes to creatures and heroes I like a little less (the streamlining has eliminated a few powers I used to like... The catacomb lords seem to have fewer unique powers, etc). 

Anyway, great game!

I was very intrigued when I first saw the second edition, although I thought the artwork was awkward.  This edition looks perfect! I saw it in at my FLGS but passed on it as it was near Christmas and I suspected I might get it as a gift.  Unfortunately I did not, and when I went back after the holidays, they were already sold out.

Good flicking game. Rules aren't great (in my mind) and organization is a pain. I don't know that this has as much a 'fun factor' as something like Dungeon Fighter, and it doesn't have the ease of something like Crokinole, so it exists in a weird sort of limbo for me.

I really like this game. I have the kickstarter version with all expansions. Unfortunately I have trouble getting it to table. Also playing overlord can be tough if you dont like guiding a group through since its certainly possible to crush the hero team if they are unskilled at flicking games. There's also a lot of rules to do with scenario set up and different shops and gold management that can make the game less accessable than its new slimmer cousin Catacombs and Castles. Still its an excellent fun gaming experience.

This game would be a 10 for me, if only the rules were a little better presented, and player aids were inlcuded.

But despite that, I don't own a game that you can have more fun with..as long as you're playing with the right type of gamers.

This game shines when the "DM" modifies a few things (not fundemental gameplay rules) but rather turns up/down the difficulty, let the players visit the shops more often, etc.....because the the aim of this game is FUN. Publisher has provided us with an amazing box of awesome, well-made components, rules that work (just need a little faq here and there) and really a the most fun I've had. 

And this is coming from someone who dislikes dungeon crawls.

This, alongside Catacombs & Castles, are my favorite boardgames hands down.  Me and my wife mainly enjoy games which are fast paced.  Catacombs has has a decent amount of strategy involved, but not too much as to overload you with analysis paralysis at any point.  Both these titles are also superb on creating countless memorable moments where the stakes are super high for both parties, and victory hinges on one shot which is often a long shot - these moments are really intense!

Lowered my score since there is now Catacombs & Castles, by the same designer, which captures the best parts of Catacombs in a smaller package and shorter game. I'd rather play that one than full Catacombs and I am more likely to get it to the table with most game groups.

This is one of the coolest dexterity games out there.  A disc flicking, 1vsMany, dungeon crawl unlike any other game I've played.

This is a simple dungeon explorer, 1 vs all, flicking game. There's a lot of variability in monsters and heroes, and the room system works very well in this game. Initially this game was ranked higher for me, but it has gone down slightly, mostly because I disagree with the dungeon room layout they have in the rules.

My recommended format is to allow for a few lives for the heroes over the course of the game, and to shorten the room count. Otherwise, if the overlord is going all out, it's pretty difficult to beat them.

Gets better every time I bring it out. Quickly becoming one of my favourite games to play. Definitely benefits from the expansion, which doubles the diversity-- we haven't found that there are quite enough item cards in the base game.

It would come out more often if the setup were a little less daunting.

I loved 2nd ed Catacombs so it's really no surprise that I love 3rd ed too. Same great game, but with adorable art to replace the hideous look of the previous editions, plus tons of extra content - yesssssssssssss!

This edition is a bit more fiddly though. There's a lot of cool new stuff... it's just that it can be somewhat hard to keep track of because there's just so many little things.

For instance, I do wish they'd kept the straight up character sheets from the previous edition and not gone modular. The card that's just character art feels like a waste, and the whole thing adds some time to setup/teardown (and woe betide any groups who want to select heroes randomly), and it's easy to just knock things out of place. It's not a huge issue but it does seem silly to have gone this route.

Also, the poison cards also just don't feel like they should have been part of the base game. First off, I'm not 100% sold on it mechanically - the idea that you could kill a hero in 3 hits at random just seems... unnecessary, at best. But more than that, it feels like such a tertiary system that I would prefer it to have been saved for an expansion just for ease of getting people into the base game.

But these are really minor issues for one of my all-time favorite games. This is just so much fun. If you like dungeon crawling, and you like flicking dics... this is an absolute no-brainer.

The mechanism is simple, the rules are rather elaborate. The rules are also rather poorly organised. A three-page summary plus the shot reference sheet can encompass everything that is in the big booklet.

The game boards are very nice and atmospheric, although the rest of the artwork is not really to my taste.

Due to the physical nature of the mechanics, a lack of (motor) skills is unfortunately impossible to compensate, which means games with the same players are likely to end in a similar way every time. 

Having bought the 1st print, I was unlucky enough to experience the terrible balance issues this game suffered. The heroes were set to lose almost always and it was only after finding out I could order a set of replacement cards and rulebook, that this game was saved for me and my friends. (Excellent service, but shipment costs were very steep, especially for a shipment that should not have been necessary. Play testing must have gone horribly wrong for this game. Yes, it still bugs me, even if I am enjoying the game now.)

(KickStarted: 3rd Edition)

Genuine fun-in-a-box. Flicking combined with dungeon-crawling really works well, and there is enough variety on display to keep you playing for a long time.

The dungeon master might feel over-matched on early boards as heroes can make short work of groups of weaker enemies... but gets a chance to shine later in the game.

Seems like there is great room for expansion - either official or homebrew. But the nice thing is that expansions aren't required: the game already plays great "as is".

Played the original edition and thought it was very good. The 2015 edition is great: bigger boards, better components, more variety, improved rules, and superb family-friendly artwork.

Gets my highest rating.

I think this game is great the way me and my group play it. A total role playing experience, creating back stories and personalities for our heroes and journeying into the catacombs. The only difference is all combat is solved by flicking wooden discs instead of rolling dice which I personally completely enjoyed even though I was terrible at it. It's also fun trying to explain why in the story the barbarian when plowing into one of his allies instead of the enemy as was intended. 
The only downsides are the pure size of the game (and box!) and different skill in players will definitely effect outcome of the game no matter how good the strategy. Otherwise a very enjoyable experience, would completely recommend it.

An interesting and thematic twist on both the dungeon crawling genre and a dexterity game.  The concept is so simple that you wonder why nobody thought of it until now.  The art work and general graphic design is very "indie" style - don't go expecting FFG quality.  Still, the game is fun and challenging.  Don't take it too seriously and enjoy flicking your character all over the map.

PROS:
-Sistema dexterity que lo hace muy, muy diferente a los demás juegos
-Se puede aumentar el número de jugadores si algunos cooperan como Señor de la mazmorra
-Se puede adaptar su duración
-Da pie a la elaboración rápida de modos propios de juego (por ejemplo, una partida de monstruos VS monstruos)

CONTRAS:
-Las habilidades de algunos monstruos están excesivamente descompensadas respecto a los héroes, por lo que es necesario utilizar reglas caseras
-Tedioso de montar y de recoger
-Muy largo si no se adapta la duración
-Las barreras son necesarias para no perder piezas, pero entorpecen los lanzamientos

A substantial improvement. Much more variety and streamlining, the latter of which helps mitigate the still rather overlong playing time. It's still awfully attritional, and the balance is tilted waaay in favour of the baddies, but I'm getting more and more tolerant of that (though it's better in a co-op environment like Doomrock). The inflexible player-count is still an issue; I'm not sure I'd want to play with 5 or 4, as controlling one hero only seems like too little to hold someone's attention.
It must be said, though, that this edition shows what a good graphical overhaul can do to a game--I never would have thought that mere art, layout, and iconography could enhance a gameplay experience this much. Well done.

This is an interesting game with some great elements but it is ultimately not one that I love.  My principal complaint is the difficulty in determining exactly what happened after each shot.  Did that monster bounce of the first guy and hit the second guy or was it the first guy that hit the second guy?  In the absence of an instant replay camera it can be very hard to tell.

My first thought upon hearing "Crokinole + dungeon crawl" was "Sign me up!" I was enthusiastic but still expecting something light and silly, and then the game really exceeded my expectations. It's both surprising and impressive how much this game offers in the way of strategy and tactics. 

The third/Kwanchai edition of of the game is absolutely amazing, with not just vastly improved components and art compared with the previous edition but also a significantly better rulebook.  

Crokinole is one of my favorite games, but I always wonder whether it should really be considered a board game, since it seems more akin to darts or barroom shuffleboard. Catacombs has much of the skill and tactics of Crokinole but also feels like a board game, with a theme I really enjoy.

The [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameartist/28024/kwanchai-moriya]Fantastically whimsical illustrations by Kwanchai Moriya[/url] tie the mechanisms of this ridiculous finger flicking fest together with the theme perfectly.

Dexterity games are generally skill contests which create an uneven playing field, but if all players are equal, and/or they can remove their egos from the equation while playing, and/or you have a Catacomb Lord that prioritizes facilitating enjoyment over victory, this could be the game for you. [url=https://youtu.be/Oo9buo9Mtos?t=18s]I am [B][I]NOT[/I][/B] that Catacomb Lord.[/url]

I'm biased towards liking dexterity games due to being adept at them. They are generally focused around uncontestable-skills, making them fun for those that excel, and not for those that don't. No matter how good your strategy and/or tactics, you will not win if you can't aim and flick a disc well.

Length of play, dexterity-desparities, and balance issues will prevent this game from hitting the table as often as I would like

Great fun for both the heroes and the big bad guy. Lots of tactics to be applied so it's not just about dexterity. High quality components, no troubles whatsoever with the game play. Best with three as you get the teamwork element out of it, but everyone still has enough playing to do.

In more detail, in Catacombs players flick wooden discs that represent the monsters and heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, while missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb.

Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game. Conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated.

This game is an interesting combination of flicking and dungeon crawl and feels a bit innovative.  Still, it also started feeling a bit repetitive very quickly as the flicking space is fairly small - I wonder if the space was larger whether it would be more or less interesting.  This game is just calling for more expansions.  If both players hold back, the game could get dull and boring in a hurry...so be aggressive and the game is more enjoyable.

Catacombs is a fantastic dexterity game with an enormous amount of repeatability thanks to the variety of monsters, heroes, items and more right out of the box.  Yes, there are a lot of rules to learn, but I think the most recent print does a great job at sectioning off the "advanced rules " which players can instead learn as they become relevant during play.  As players improve their flicking skill, they'll begin to truly appreciate the deep tactical aspects as well.  And that's to say nothing of the gorgeous stylized artwork which perfectly reflects the imagination and playfulness of the game.

-Extreme simplicity but still very tactical and lots of stuff
-The face your friend makes when you tell him you're going to play fantasy heroes fighting monsters... by flicking!
-The art is simply amazing! I'm usually not that big of a fan of fantasy, but this definitely is an exception

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-The need to balance once you start adding expansions

Finally I found it! A non-party game, a game that actually takes an hour or two that I can give a 10! I could play this forever! The art is also just perfect and totally my style! And I knew of this game's existence for at least 6 months already, why didn't I get this earlier?! Arrrrrrghhhh!!!

This game fixes all the issues I had in Imperial Assault.

Firstly, it's literally explained in just a minute. You give the players the choice between the simplest heroes and explain the rush, melee, and ranged shots. That's it! The rest you can explain as it appears. Placed the game board? Tell them where to deploy, that they need to kill all the monsters in the room, and that all heroes goes first, then lord, then heroes... As shops appear and monsters with new types of shots, you just explain their function then and there. All the rest they will get by playing: of course you need to have no obstacles blocking you to be able to hit someone, far shots are more risky... 

Being able to ricochet and hit multiple targets is what makes the difference between beginners and masters.

The most annoying part I found in Imperial Assault was that you had a lot of small but most of the times pointless choices, especially regarding where to deploy and end your movement: should I start with this hero here or the space next to it? Should I end on the left side of the door or the right? Like OMG just choose something! But sometimes 1 space can change everything... In Catacombs, this is all decided by how hard you flicked. If you picked the system of Catacombs, removed the flicking part and just placed your units wherever they have line of sight, it would have the same problem as Imperial Assault.

Also, when you make a risky, far away shot in Imperial Assault, you calculate the chances of hitting your target. If you had above 90% and still missed, you call bullshit. In Catacombs, it's all about "do YOU believe you can make the shot?". When you miss it's just an "awww", but when you hit, the whole table sheers.

Did I mention yet how hilarious this game is when you imagine what is happening? The ice shot that just stops in front of the target unit; the sprinting to the other side of the map that looks more like flying, while taking someone with you; or the opposite, where you barely flicked and the character basically just trips over himself. This goes on all the time!

Yet another problem Imperial Assault has is that all enemies are basically just different numbers. That's a problem you usually get when you work with bigger numbers as a standard (4 speed, 3 health...). But because in Catacombs most enemies have only 1 health and there are no 4 different dice, the designers had to be more creative and it shows.

In Imperial Assault, I found that the Imperial Player created a meta by choosing the same, most powerful troops every time. In this game, you can see the power level of the monster on the back on the card so you can just pick a random one whenever you have to choose.

Fun game but setup is really long. It's best to prep every room before you get the game out to play so that there isn't so much down time between turns. It is also a bit too long for what it is so we've figured out how to just save a game and only play a couple of rooms at a time.

RATING: 10
Love this game: the art, gameplay, and room for strategic teamwork.

My only complaint is the time requirement, as Catacombs always seems to take longer than you'd expect for a flicking game. However, the extended game helps to build the sense of narrative during a session and if you really prefer a shorter game then it's easy to change the room structure to accommodate.

Oh boy is this game overrated! It is often described as the perfect marriage between flicking and dungeon crawling games. But its far from perfect, as it has inherited most flaws from both! To be clear, let me name a few:
-A skilled player will inadvertently destroy bad players.
-Way too long for a (supposedly light) flicking game.
-Too much waiting between turns.
-Imbalanced: some heroes are way more interesting than others, and the overlord has a clear edge.
-Player elimination, which is encouraged if the overlord wants to play competitively.

I have grown to love dexterity games.  Catacombs adds to this genre by pitting a dungeon overlord in control of the cavern monsters against a team of fantasy explorers.  On your turn you will be flicking discs representing your character(s) or various weapons at your opponent.  Hit them and they take damage.  Love the concept here and the fantasy theming.  Lots of flickin' fun!

Great fun playing this fantasy flicking game. Honestly this game felt more dungeon crawly to me in terms of experience than anything I've played recently. Players get these hero disks and need to flick their way through different rooms of monsters controlled by a single player, and make it to and kill the end boss. Along the way they get to buy items and heal.  Each character has different abilities depending on the flick sequence printed on their cards. The difficulty is a little high, with hero groups often dying to the boss battle, but the experience of play is lots of fun regardless.

7.5 - A super cute game, I considered keeping it for the artwork alone.  Many Vs One games require a delicate balance and in Catacombs the balance seems to be weighted in favor of the Catacomb Lord.  The problem I have with this is the CL also should be the most experienced player and skill has a huge impact.  It's extremely fun to play but feels like it would work best as a 2 player game.

I wanted, wanted, wanted to like this game because of the amazing artwork, and the idea of flicking your way through a dungeon.  To host the game requires a huge investment, that I can understand, but then, the host also takes 10 moves to the 1-2 of each player-- you put in all this time to host a party, but then your guests don't get to have much fun.  Like the worst of dungeon crawls of yore.  Maybe I will try it as a players someday.

Should I called unbalanced? Three games, changing game masters, but the adventurers had never a chance to win. Another 8 games without me, same result. Now he's playing with V1 rules and has a lot more fun - and the others too :)

tl;dr: fun but too long

I guess the best description is: Crokinole meets Descent. A dungeon crawl where the monsters are flicking disks. Good fun, but I did feel it went on for a bit too long. Also, as someone who sees theme as a method of making rules easier to digest, I don't really see the added value over Crokinole, so I'd rather play that. It is cheaper though, but still not cheap at all.

Adding a bunch of rules to Crokinole does not make it better.

Even better than the original. One of the best dexterity games ever made.

A box of flicky goodness. Fun and suprisingly a depth of strategy. Also quite tireing to play lol :)

Catacombs is a game about easy shots gone awry and the groans that accompany them, and the miraculous shots that never should of happened and the yelps of joy that follow. It's an event as much as it is a game. It incorporates all the parts of RPGs that I enjoy and jettisons the rest. Flexible enough to allow room for creativity, with a solid core that makes sure everything works.

Not a huge fan of dexterity nor of all-versus-one style games but Catacombs somehow manages to worm it's way into my gaming heart.

I like the concept of this game so much, but it's so hard for me to get into 1 vs many games because I usually end up being the 1. On top of that, this game is completely unbalance in favor of the 1, so it just feels like I have to force myself to do terrible to give the players a shot.

The artwork in this edition is great, but the gameplay for me is really just mediocre.

Glad I never upgraded my originals, as the designers apparently wrecked the system by making unbalanced and insufficiently tested gameplay modifications.  Poison isn't just for [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq4j1LtCdww]Alice Cooper[/url] anymore.

First edition [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10640/doom-boardgame]Doom[/url] - and now Catacombs - should be a reminder that it's no fun for the evil taskmaster to win every single game.  Particularly before the "game" even really gets started.

Bully for me for having a bit of self control.  For once.

SO MANY STICKERS. Seriously, you pretty much have to set aside a day to get all of them on.

Game itself was fantastic dexterity / dungeon crawl. Only minor gripe is that sometimes the DM will have to game it a little to keep things fun if they're just destroying the heroes. But definitely lots of flicking fun with the right group :)

-- Sold: 10/30/16 - No one was every really interested in this, didn't really make it to the table beyond the initial play.

RATING: 3
While I love the theme and the mechanics, my group finds the balance to be horribly off.  There appears to be one strategy to win (Mercy, light on the territory, build and promote a lot).  We loved the first half dozen sessions though.

A fast war game for 4 that uses satisfying mechanics . Makes me not want to play older war games that only use dice. Would rate higher if it had dynamic turn order and no Kickstarter exclusives

RATING: 6
Mixes deck building with some area control and tech tree/building aspects. Also has a system that lets you upgrade cards in your deck which isn't all that different that just buying more powerful cards but in this case you have to have the weaker cards already in your deck. Hard to tell after one play how balanced the game is. Building seems powerful and while the area control could be a big way to get points, it seems far less consistent. There's really nothing to prevent people from going the building route but you can at least fight for areas if someone gets too powerful. There's also a light/shadow track thing but the strategy seemed very obvious that you just max out one side and stay there for more points. My score is definitely partially reflective that I'm not a huge fan of deck builders. This one at least has more going on but I still didn't find it terribly engaging and also long for what it does.

The longer this game went on, the less I liked it.  There are so many combo's each player is trying to fire off at the end that the game kind of bogs down to a crawl.  Another interesting take on deck building / area control, but I think this just has too much min maxing that it just kind of got old.  Something I wouldn't mind playing again, but I think I would rather play games like Tyrants of the under dark.  I also don't like that there is only 1 card of each of the high level cards.  Feels a bit too random on who gets it if they are going for the same faction.

I think the real problem here is it just needed a bit more time in the oven. You have a fairly simple area control game and a deckbuilder, but they then add structured tiers to the deck building, which is a neat idea. In the end though, the whole thing sort of comes out a hot mess and I just wish I had played Tyrants Of The Underdark instead. Not to say this is bad, just that there are better games that do nearly the same thing. If I really wanted tech trees, I now know that it is sort of a bad idea to do that in a deckbuilder. And it's imporant games like these exist, feel out new mechanics, show us what works and what doesn't and why. Maybe the next game that uses a similar idea will polish it and make it work right. Play Codex, Tyrants Of The Underdark, Cry Havoc (after reading the extensive faq and errata), etc. Those games all do it better IMHO. But that doesn't make this game bad. I would play again, but only if no other games really worked for me that were on offer.

A super duper deckerbuilder, with mutilple tech trees, and area control.
Deck building is not a much loved mechanic for me, but this one  has tension.

Got to play a copy of this and loved it. There are some random elements, but not so much that you aren't able to adjust your strategy (unless the dice are REALLY not with you). There are SO many different ways to win. There can be a lot of player interaction, or not very much, just depends on the playstyle of your group. Very complex game, but one you have fun learning. I'm not a big fan of the finite number of turns, but honestly if you don't limit it and your group plays slow it can take forever. SOLID pickup.

Path of Light and Shadow is the second game I've ever received from Kickstarter. I was drawn in by the description of an area control game and deckbuilder, but especially by the idea that your game changes whether or not you decide to go "Cruel" or "Merciful". I loved the concept, and reading about the game made it sound quite interesting! So far, I've played twice - once was a 4-player game and the other was a 2-player game.  Don't be fooled by what you would normally expect from an area control game! PoLaS most likely works best at 2 players - maybe 3 players.  A first game a 4 players is going to be long and stretch the incentives out a little too thin over the time you first work through the game.  2 players creates a rather nice back-and-forth game and the pacing isn't hampered by the wait while the other player works through their turn. So if you're looking for a good 2-player deck builder and area control game, you can't go wrong with Path...!

Overall, PoLaS is quite good, even if the theme doesn't come through as much as the game might suggest on first glance.  Lots of stuff we've seen before in terms of deckbuilding and area control, but it doesn't feel like a straight re-hash of other games from those two genres. I like how each faction has their own flavour and are spread out across the land for you to recruit. Choosing to become Cruel/Merciful is certainly a part of the game but not as much of a thrust or focus as I thought it would be.  It will dictate for you your long-range deck-building strategy, which makes things interesting and you will think after your game about whether you want to try going the opposite way next time or not (both have merits).  The combat system works well and gives you enough to think about without muddying the flow of the game too much.  Production wise, I wasn't altogether impressed. An ugly map and the layout of the tracks could have been better executed. Poorly punched cards and slight offsets on the art makes things look a tad unprofessional. Inconsistencies in the plastic prevent certain parts made to fit together from actually fitting together. The art on the cards themselves though is great and goes a long way of painting some consistency for each faction! Overall, though, any feeling of narrative doesn't really come through and for a game with such evocative card hard, it can feel soulless at times.  The card effects aren't wholly interesting and while more significant effects come from the structures, you may have a hard time keeping track of all the extra effects in your first few games. The allies are a nice inclusion and motivate players to go after some competing objectives, but they haven't played much of a part in our games so far.  Bash the leader seemed to be a problem for most of the game, and yet we only realized at the end that the leader could easily be hidden in the Merciful players who gathered end-game points into their deck through promotion.  (This is a good thing!)

There is a good amount of stuff here to like in PoLaS and also a few other things which perhaps could have been strengthened before the release, especially with the production and better board art and narrative background could have given the game the "world building" it most likely needs.  It doesn't come close to being a revolutionary game, nor one that might be on peoples' radar a few years from now.  I will keep this game around for now because the sum of its parts does offer a experience that you can't necessarily find elsewhere.

INITIAL IMPRESSION
Enjoyed all aspects of this game. Deck builder but with a lot more (area control, promoting/culling deck, buildings, morality track). The game took longer than expected, I'm not seeing it going down that much in future plays (especially if we do 4p). However I think once you know all the cards, that can help with time and having a card player aid for everyone. 

The mercy/cruel track wasn't as impactful as I thought. You pretty much max out one side for bonuses and extra points, no reason to stay in the middle or swap around. Not a detractor for me but it wasn't quite what I expected. The area control is weak early on but becomes huge at the end.

My only concern for the game is if there are viable other paths to victory outside of doing everything. Area control is hard early on without buildings and promoting/buildings seem extremely strong, giving econ and points. Will have to see if the variability is there in future games since all cards are used in every game. Also Mercy may be a bit OP compared to Cruel

The game - right from the rules explanation - felt incredible.  Feels like it pushes you to be cruel, even though merciful is supposed to be an advanced player's path.

Interesting game combining deck building with area control. Set up and tear down are long. Going to up my rating slightly after a couple plays. Seems to have a lot of possible choices. My only concern is whether the end game area control overwhelms much of the strategy that might be played on the way to the end.

Very good - enjoy playing and would suggest it.

There are plenty of choices to make with your hand of cards in this deck-building game :
--> You can upgrade your cards with better one (until legendary unique level III cards)
--> You can remove X cards from your deck in your hand/discard in one turn
--> You can try to conquer a province (include dice rolling)
--> You can evolve on different branches of your own tech tree
--> You can do a specific action of a card

What is different from other deck-building games :
--> Cards that you add  on your deck are drawn face down from 4 differents factions depending on which province your leader is on the board....
Each factions have their own play style. (but il is important to notice that they are not completly different because you can find some similar cards on each faction deck)
--> You can evolve on your own tech-tree that permit you to have a specific play style
--> You can also evolve either Cruel or Mercifull on this game :
       [To be cruel] : Remove cards from your deck 
            Benefit : Have more strengh ressources ==> help to conquer for VP
       [To be mercifull] : Add more cards on your deck 
            Benefit : Have more labor ressources ==> help to evolve on your tech-tree for VP

Conquering action is based on a dice rolling system ... so you can miss it if you are not lucky. ... There are some abilities helps to mitigate the luck like rerolling dice.
There are some ruin faces on the dice that decrease the defense of the province or remove from the game some attacking cards that were used for the attack.


Each 4 rounds (a year), There is an intermediate scoring system that provide you some victory points depending on the remaining defense of the provinces you control. You also add some victory points for each 2 province of the same faction you control (realm).

The end of the game scoring (after 3 years) :
- VP on upgraded cards
- VP for each raised level on the tech-tree
- VP for levels 4 of tech-trees that permit you to earn points in differents circumstance
- VP for Ally cards that can be obtain in the game with some triggers

An area control version of ThunderStone. 

It has a good starter deck set-up approach, where everyone plays with a common 7 card deck, 1 card added from an "Advisor" set and 2 cards from one of the 4 province decks. This, unlike other deck builder games, gives you a step up on deck development (the annoying early game element for any deck builder) while also encouraging you to try a different strategy each game based on what your starting "seed" is.

Wow, this a fantastic game all around. The deck building is awesome and plays a vital role in your strategy. I love you can thin the deck and take the cruel track by having a smaller focused deck or be merciful and have large deck . The cards are multi purpose, use them to build, attack, defend, or special actions, or to remove other cards from your deck. The custom dice for combat are cool and the ruin aspect is very unique. You can damage provinces making them less valuable when you try and conquer them.  Also, combat isnt all luck as you can supplement your attacks with more cards and have you have the option to build buildings granting you attack bonuses. Also, cards in your deck can be upgraded into more powerful cards. So much to do. This is the best empire builder i have played. Just an awesome game!

This game is really fun! There's not quite anything out there like it. It's deck building with area control primarily. There's also a morality track and buildings you can build. There's a tiny bit of luck, but there are definitely ways to mitigate it. If you're a thematic gamer, then this is a must buy!

I love the multiple paths to victory. I've seen successful strategies ranging from turtling up to outright aggression to collecting the 'coolest' cards. So many options and so much NATURAL replayability. I find myself wanting to revisit just to take a different (pardon the expression) path... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

RATING: 7.5
Imaginative game that uses a deck building core on a wargame-lite chassis with tech improvements also in the mix.

I like that recruiting new cards is not a purely procedural process; while there is a lot of variability in which cards you recruit, promoting cards (a good thing to do) is entirely under a player's control. I also like how your position on the cruel / merciful morality track governs whether you are best focusing on a thin or thick deck approach.

One player felt it lacked interaction (and that may be a valid comparison in relation to say Blood Rage), but I think the level of interaction is down to the players' appetite for attacking, which is easier for cruel players.

Path of Light and Shadow does not live in grey. It is about stark contrasts — picking a path and and never deviating. While this helps players focus on how they should play, it leaves little room for creative exploration of complex, interworking mechanisms. This is a shame. There are so many neat, original ideas here, it could have found greatness in between those extremes.

Path of Light and Shadow testé. Règles épurées et thématiques, beau design graphique, superbes dessins, plein de cartes différentes. Mais une richesse qui m'a empêché de suivre vraiment ce que faisaient mes adversaires (genre : 5 cartes promues en 5 nouvelles cartes en un tour, que l'on ne prenait même pas le temps de montrer), et des pouvoirs et statistiques de cartes souvent pas assez marqués pour être super thématiques. Bien mais pas exactement pour moi. Si tu as aimé Blood Rage, tu pourras aimer. Voilà !

Played with 4 players. Battles can be quite intense near the end of the game and can lead to some unexpected outcomes. This deck building game does not allow you to choose which cards you add to your deck, but this randomness did not dissapoint so far. There are enough opportunities to tune your deck, and soon your engine will be running.
The game exceeds my expectations. Can be quite complex because of all the different mechanics, but they are combined smoothly.
Not sure whether I should rate this 8 or 9, I need to play it more often to give my final thoughts.

After first playthrough... It's an interesting deck-builder, area-control hybrid. Gaining cards, building up your structures, and taking areas, all give you points. Too early to say if it's well balanced but at our first go through it seems like it is. The look of the game is pretty good. Solidly made pieces, especially the well put together player boards. The main map is a little sad blurry, not all it could be, but that's livable. I like the card art, especially for the cool purple cards. 

It's a fairly easy game to learn to play but it'll take some time to learn to play it well. Learning all the cards and how they interact will be critical to long-term success (in our first play we just bumbled through and had a fine old time). A possible ding is that it requires a fair bit of shuffling through decks of cards, either through your own discard pile or through various realm upgrade decks. I didn't mind but I could see some players being bugged by this. Myself, I'm interested in learning how the different cards work with each other. I see this is a plus.

Two points to note. Avoid with AP players (all the card choices will drive them mad) and avoid with players who are, er, not entirely trustworthy. You'll have a hard time keeping track of what the other players are doing on their board (I didn't even bother, but then I trusted my fellow player).

First play impression: I like the gameplay a lot. The deckbuilding and the tech upgrades are really well done. It's easy to cull cards from your deck so you have a lot of control over your strategy.

My only concern is that it seems like the winner will largely be determined randomly. There's a good deal of randomness in the game between the card draws and the dice rolls. At the end of the game there are a lot of points up for grabs, so those dice rolls and card draws can have a significant impact. One die roll could result in more than a 20 points swing (points from taking over a building plus the realm bonuses).

Right now I'm viewing this game in the same way as Mystic Vale: the gameplay is so good that I'll continue to play it, but I don't take it too seriously because of the amount of randomness.

Mostly deckbuilder, with tech tree + area control elements; "build an empire" theme. A bit more luck than in most deckbuilders, as you have less control over what goes into your deck than in most others, though you do have tools which can mitigate this impact, and there is some luck/die rolling involved in combat.

I just played this with Jonathan Gilmoure at a con. Have you ever played a game with the designer and everyone asks what you think and you have to find a nice way of saying that the game they spent a year making sucks so hard you bit off the tip of your tongue in order to keep yourself awake? I didn't have to do that for this one!

The card art is pretty great in this game. The board doesn't look bad. The pieces are a bit basic plastic miniatures but the player stat boards are awesome and I wasn't really in it for beautiful minis (maybe the final print will be less basic but I wouldn't care either way.)

The game play was awesome. It was everyones first time so we were super focused on ourselves and not everyone else until the last year of play. Everyone else decided to build up their cities and themselves and their abilities while I just promoted everyone in my army and sacrifices my deck until I was always drawing really good cards. This worked out well as I just masacred everyone around me (destroying my own cities in the process) and that really appeals to my sadistic nature. I didn't win though, the guy next to me built himself up all holier than thou and built up his people around him. He only ended up winning by 1 point on the valor list though so it was neck and neck. Two very different strategies and it was super close. Now that we know how to play I can think of a dozen strategies that may have worked too.

The variety and fun you can have with this game is off the charts. The time that has been placed in this game was awesome and when I play it again I am sure it'll be a completely different scenario as I will be paying attention to my fellow players more now that I understand the rules better.

This game is going to end up becoming a staple game that I play over and over and over.

Initial impression - limited plays
The confluence of deck building and 3X-ish (no eXplore, map is fixed) style play seems to work pretty well.  Game definitely rewards focusing on mercy or cruelty, and it is very difficult to determine how well balanced the paths are (have already seen complaints about mercy building being OP).  Definitely need more plays to settle on a rating.

Very promising first play.  Almost like Blood Rage in a vague way in that the game is much more in the cards in your hand and the board acts more as a visual representation.  Looking forward to playing more.

Deck building with a purpose. A nice variety of choices allowing for different strateties. Good blend of area control and combat and an easy mechanic to cull cards from your deck. I like it.

Last night it appeared to be a very rough game for people why haven't played a deckbuilder before, so a minimum few games of Dominion are recommended before starting this game. The experienced deck builders enjoyed the almost-sandbox freedom: there are far more paths to victory than just Light and Shadow.

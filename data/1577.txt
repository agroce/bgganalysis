Explore Africa and hope you live long enough to publish your discoveries.  You play against the game system, can be quite brutal since you can lose all your discoveries if you don't make it back to England to publish.
I have both the AH and Discovery Games copy(bought it from Dave Arneson).
Just got another copy with Tributary supplement and wargamer mag with articles on SoTN ($13 for whole bundle).

Played at Ed's March 2012.

Has not aged well. Player moves, rolls to get lost, rolls for river, rolls for natives, if gets natives rolls for native disposition, rolls for hunting, way too many rolls. Components are also a product of their age. 

Will not play this one again. Love the theme though, very deserving of a re-make with modern game design concepts. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Yeah, I'd been wanting this one for a while, basically for the theme - the idea of a game based around cartography and movement gets me hot, what can I say.  I knew what I was in for, having sampled enough of AH's older product to know that fiddly b.s. was the name of the game.  And yeah, it's a fiddly mess, in many ways - all that paper tracking is a drag!  Still, I got my copy for a reasonable price, and I must always give props to AH for themes that rock.  I might haul this one out for an occasional solo play, but otherwise, probably won't hit the table too often, as it is SLOW and LONG.  If someone could re-do this as a Euro, I'd sing their praises...

A very slow and record keeping intensive game.  Most of your time is spent keeping track of your expedition rather than exploring. I also don't think the game is well balanced. The opportunities to get lost, suffer a disaster, get attacked by natives or suffer some other tragedy seem to occur disproportionately to the positive aspects of the game.  I spent one expedition within two hexes of my starting point because of getting lost and recurring disasters. Didn't make for much fun to be constantly denied the opportunity to do what is the fun aspect of the game, explore.

Great change of pace from the "traditional" wargame.  Unique in that one creates the mapboard as one plays.

Fun, but became a little predictable after a while.

This is an important game from a design study standpoint, in the sense that it represents a pure implementation of a specific style of play: Outfit an expedition on a finite budget using an open-ended menu of options, and then watch as it wanders around the map and hits random obstacles that test the quality of those initial choices. The actual exploration system is something that would be enhanced by a larger number of meaningful low-level decisions.

Rules are not the best written and it takes a while to play, but a fantastic experience game. Immerse your imagination in it and it repays in spades.

I really enjoy this game of exploring Africa.  Apart from the coastal terrain, most of the map is uncharted and you create the map as you go.  This, combined with interesting events and interaction with various native tribes, creates an excellent narrative.  On the downside, the expedition system involves too much math, and the river rules are sometimes open to interpretation.  Competitive players will probably complain about the amount of luck and the lack of player interaction as well.

I was like 15 then and exploring Africa sounded just awesome (and it was).

Discovery of Africa. Basically multi-player solitaire, where each player follows his own path into the unknown, rolling lots and lots of dice (or alternatively, turning over lots and lots of cards) to see what he encounters. A game which was only so-so even back in the early 80's when I played it. Sold my copy long ago.

RATING: 8
Once you get past the typical confusing Avalon Hill rulebook, there's a great game waiting for you.  I'm sure that if it were released today, there would be terrain tiles involved, but the crayons used to draw terrain on the map worked quite well.  An excellent exploration game... and lots of fun with the right players.

Definitely has some interesting mechanics. But it plays way too long and is way to random for its length. It is not really a game as much as an experience.  The system for creating expeditions is the main problem. It is way to complex and really slows the game down. Every time you make a change to your expedition you should ideally update your sheet, it is just not viable. Additionally the "lost mechanic is just ridiculous. I get what it is trying to model, but there should really be another way to discourage exploring jungles and swamp rather than have a randomly loose a turn mechanic.

The game is brilliant. Combining Roleplay, exploration, and other boardgame elements really gets you into the game. Disaster or Fame is always around the corner. It's never the same game twice because the terrain you find will always turn out different everytime you play.

Great game of discovery, but the rules are a bit of a mess.  Lots of card flipping, dice rolling, and it's perhaps too easy to lose your guide, but I always have a good time playing.  Has an expansion called 'Tributary' that adds to the game.  Can really have some wild adventures.  Maybe the best exploration game I know, but be prepared for diseases, wild elephant herds, restless natives and sick horses...  There really is nothing else like it among the exploration games I have played, and it certainly is deadly.

July '17:  First game with my son, and had a great time.  He ended up getting lost most turns and starving.  I got smacked by a tiny tribe in my first mounted expedition, but managed to make it back to Europe and outfil again, winning with some 37 points to 21.  Still the hest exploration game for getting the feel of the angst, frustration, and excitement of discovery.

Outstanding theme,but this game lacks some key elements to be an exceptional game.  It suffers from "multiplayer solitaire" - ideal for a PBEM situation, but given the game length, can really fall into long periods of downtime in a face-to-face game.  (Returning to Europe midgame could minimize one's actions for an hour or more.) As with many AH games fo the era, it's also capricious in the effect a single die roll result can have on one's investment of time.  The game also has a steep leanring curve; not many players are very competitive on their first expedition.  This makes for another barrier to play.  The theme is responsible for inflating my rating of this game.

Tremendously detailed, this is the very apex of all the exploration/adventure games in my book. Yes way too fiddly by nowadays standards; but the sheer amount of replay value is still unmatched. A jewel.

A friend of mine used to own a discovery Games version of this a long time ago.  It was very fun to play, though the couple times that I played I usually ended up trying for one of the big 'epic" journey things without adequate preparation and ended up getting lost and die-ing.

Have crayon and will travel. An old gamer was giving away this collection at the club and I got this. I played it a few times, but found that it was abit old fashioned for me and sold it off at a B&B. Strangely the shoe-string early explorations always seemed to do well, but when you returned with a well equiped, well supplied expedition with bearers and guards you always fell apart. I recall that nature-lover explorers had a butterfly icon and got supply their men with food by big game hunting.

Loved this theme-happy game in high school, with its clever wax crayon discovery mechanic.  I look at the rules now and shudder!  All that record-keeping makes Steve Peek's designs look like Go.

Wow, haven't played this in fifteen years.  A nice change of pace from old-school AH, in the form of African exploration.  Perfectly suited to solitaire play.  Also, perfectly suited to creating your own continents to explore.  Quite a lot of luck involved, but I have fond memories.

Only played Game I.  Lots of fun coloring the map and making 'discoveries'.  Killing natives doesn't seem to have the hard decisions I'd expected from the given Table and firing 'bearers' in the middle of the jungle as a means to manage resources seems too gamey.

12/25/16 Exp 1: Captured/Escaped: 16 VP
12/25/16 Exp 2: Tsetse Fly death: 0 VP

Update: Great idea very poorly executed. The game is too lethal and slow to play. The rules are underdeveloped, incomplete, and difficult to use. In definite need of streamlining. My thoughts:
1) Disasters only when attempting to move to an unknown hex.
2) No Lost dr but MUST have a Guide to explore unknown hexes.
3) Mapping only 1 unknown hex per turn.
4) All Natives are Friendly upon Discovery, no Negotiations/Gifts or Combat.
5) Explorer cannot die from Member death by subsequent DR.
6) Hunting/Rations as written.

This may be the ultimate exploration game: you draw the map as you discover it. An interesting and challenging game to play, but frustrating too, in that your expedition rarely gets very far before disaster strikes. The paperwork/bookkeeping involved in outfitting an expedition is tedious, but actually exploring Africa is great fun. Source of the Nile, however, practically defines the phrase "multi-player solitaire." I suspect that this game is played more for the experience of playing it than for any sense of competition between opposing players. And you gotta love taking the role of a journalist: you get more victory points for being defeated in battle by natives, as opposed to defeating them yourself... because it makes for a better story!

Purchased this one circa 1981 for $16. I recall being intrigued by a write-up in one of Omni Magazine's annual game recommendation issues.  I read the rules and realized no one I gamed with would go for it.  It remains in its box unplayed, 25+ years later.  Crap, where does the time go?!  I will play this eventually!  Really.

I love this game, but it isn&#039;t for everyone.  It is definitely simultaneous solitaire.  But it&#039;s entertaining to watch your opponents get lost in the swamp, run through the jungle with nothing but the musket in their hands, etc.

Bought this new when I was a kid back in the late '70s. It's seen some use, but is still in very playable condition. Box is showing its age and can only be described as being in 'fair' condition - though no tears or blown corners. All cards are accounted for though again, many show slight staining and 'age spots.' Board is in pretty good shape and all tokens are accounted for except one red cache, (#7) for which the extra red chit has been artfully substituted. All green, orange and gold tokens are un-punched, as are many of the natives. Includes a nearly complete game-log pad and the original crayons!

There's something intriguing and iconic in mapping Africa with a crayon, that no other game in my collection can quite deliver. Nothing deeply strategic here, but some relevant push your luck decisions and a definite sense of adventure.

Rules are somewhat loose but not too bad at all considering the time of publication and the rpg slant of the game (traditionally prone to ambiguities and vagueness).

This is one of the set of "initial" games that I bought in the '70's when it was released that propelled me into board gaming.  I remember seeing the game box intriguingly nestled between PanzerBlitz and The Russian Campaign.   I marked up the original map so thoroughly with crayons that it became muddy and somewhat unusable.   This isn't really a game, though, it is a story generator based on an algorithm that depends on random inputs to determine its path at every turn.   The only control the player has is in managing the logisitics of the expedition, the amount of food, water and so forth.  This can be fun, but then why not just plan a real trip into the wild?   Even so, I have a soft spot in my heart (and my head) for this one.

I still need to play this, but I need to figure out a way to protect the board, first.  I don't trust that it will last well through repeated plays.  I may wind up making a number of copies, taping them together, and then laminating the whole thing.  We'll see.

I am rating this as a solo game as I have not yet played with an opponent.

I think this is best played as an "experience" game, much like Betrayal at House on the Hill, Tales of Arabian Nights or Consulting Detective.  

I am getting a real kick out of this one.  Only three plays so far, but it is extremely satisfying drawing in a new bit of terrain or another section of river.  The disasters are great fun and the special discoveries are actually pretty interesting.

This is not a game of difficult choices at every turn.  Mostly you just keep plugging along until you're short of supplies or men or both.  But there are times when you genuinely agonize over what to do; keep going or turn back? Go back through explored (safer) hexes or try exploring a couple new areas on the way home?  If you are really close to a special discovery or mapping an entire river this can be a tough choice.

However, it isn't the tough decisions that make the game.  Its the exploration, the story that emrges.  Its a really an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

I think it would be fun to play with opponents because the race to publish sounds like it would add to the game.  

I give it an 8 for now.  I think this is more likely to drop rather than raise, but it is also unlikely that I'll ever want to get rid of it either.

Update: rating goes from 8 to 6.

Wow! A recent play of this was a real dud and I can't figure out why. It has made me very hesitant to use my limited gaming time trying to get the old magic back. 

I think it just felt to complicated and fiddly last time. Hmmm. I must play it again. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1


Overall - 1

Has a crazy comical 'height of British Imperiallism' thing going for it. We have as much fun making up silly names, situations, and reports for the things we find as we do actually playing the game.

Would not play it all the time, but I think a campaign with recurring characters that carry over could be fun.

Source of the Nile is a lot less fun than it should be.  My recent plays have been frustrating in how slowly the game goes, how few of the interesting bits actually get played (versus too much sickness and losing to attacking natives) and how horrible the rules are.

Cool exploration game.  There's a lot of "deepest darkest Africa" stereotypes here, including squidgy portrayal of natives without agency.  That said, the theme of a mid-20th century B-movie set in Africa comes across really well.  So long as players understand that they are playing a send-up of the genre and not really a historical examination of what colonialism was really like, this can be enjoyable from a thematic perspective.  It really is incredible to see what's on the next tile, and you never know when your whole party will get trampled by a herd of rhinos.

As far as gameplay, the rules are pretty clunky, especially regarding rivers, but it's a fun press-your-luck experience overall.  You have to be aware of the fact that you might just get killed at any time and be okay with this. Gamers who shun luck should stay away -- this game isn't for you.

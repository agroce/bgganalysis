Slowly becoming a Martin Wallace fan, although the majority of the games I have played and loved have been his more recent works which play in a shorter amount of time.  I will eventually try to play his older works, just more convenient to play the stuff that finishes in an hour and a half with our game group.  Really like this as a tight, fun, and fast playing economic euro.

Another wonderful Martin Wallace title. Rich in theme, well researched (as is always the case with any of Mr. Wallace's games), and filled with the need to make very difficult decisions from start to finish. Wonderfully done. Some have slammed the art, but I'm perfectly happy with the game as it's beautifully produced.

RATING: 8
Sweet theme! Great elegance. At top of turn roll dice to determine market price for tin and copper (on different price scales) Actions include: Auction mines, mining (purchase and fill mine with water cube) build enhancements, sell pasties (for a pound) and pass. The action track is updated and immediately affects turn order. Victory points are acquired by end of turn purchases.

RATING: 8
After playing twice in one night, I am convinced that this is one of Wallace's most appealing economic games. I enjoy it even more than Brass due to its elegance. The rules are straight forward and there are no exceptions, which leads to a smoothly flowing game. There are a remarkable amount of nuances to consider, which was quite a surprise. I really enjoy this game, and think it is worth a purchase if you like econ games, even with the rough USD/GBP conversion rate.

Fantástico diseño de juego, de dificultad media, mucho menos que lo habitual del autor, con un tema y adaptación coherente con ella de reglas, de lo más conseguido para un eurogame (al igual que puede pasar con Brass, pero este juega en otra liga). Sorprende y me encanta, cómo en el manual va contando la historia y anécdotas de la industria minera de Cromwall, donde la mayor dificultad para los mineros era achicar el agua que inundaba los túneles (con el invento de la máquina de vapor) a la vez que va explicando las reglas del juego, adaptadas a su historia. Magistral. 
El juego es para 3-4 jugadores, de una hora y pico de duración, con bastante azar que cambia la perspectiva a todos al mismo tiempo durante el juego (fluctuacion precio mercado estaño/cobre, aparición de nuevas vetas de mineral) pero también de forma individual, lo que puede hacer perder puntos al juego... y con unas mecánicas bien adaptadas, sobretodo destacando la de gestión de puntos de tiempo para las acciones. Un pequeño gran juego.

From the Review: I don't know what to think of this game. One guys likes it the other thinks it is flawed. Everyone seems to agree that the water mechanic is neat and the market variability makes you have to think. I comes across as a "next step" game and a lean Wallace game. With that being said and given that it is a 3-4 player game I think I will stay away from this game. But like most games, I am willing to try it

Market prices too random to put much thought in to it, I won because I sold out everything I owned early when prices were high and other players were building a regular engine but prices were bad for the last half of the game.

Solid game.  Yes the market is random and I can see it's downside, but it's not a game spoiler for me - all people are affected.  And, just like life, you can't predict everything.  Only drawback for me is $60 price tag.  Won't buy it for that much.

A number of interesting mechanics that combine for a good game.  The market fluctuation and dice-rolling for resources mean that no two games will be alike.  The random element is well-constrained since you have the option of bidding on a region with unknown resources (determined by the kindness of the dice) or a region with a known quantity of resources.  The limited availability of improvements and the way player turn order works provides numerous opportunities for careful planning.  Game length is perfect, not too long giving the players a limited time frame and making games fairly quick (maybe 1-2 hours for 4 players, depending on AP and familiarity).

Money management is crucial, particularly since you use money (earned from mining copper and tin and selling the mined resources at the current market rates) to purchase VPs.

Very punishing, harsh at times.  The dice can be a cruel mistress.

One critique is that while the cost per VP increases over the 4 rounds, making early investments more valuable, all VP blocks in a given round have the same exchange rate.  Thus, there is no difference between purchasing a 40 VP spot versus spots on the 20, 5 and 15 VP blocks.  This dramatically reduces the importance of investment order in each turn, and significantly limits the amount of player interaction for the external investments.

The game would probably be more interesting, and a bit more fun, if the higher-cost VP spots on each round were worth a better return than the lower-cost VP spots on that round.  Might be worth it to rework the external investments block with this in mind.

Even so, a very good game that Martin Wallace fans should try.  I'm glad I got this one.

ok, this is quite nifty. Like the bits, the time mechanism and the tension between buying VPs and keeping working capital. I don't think the relatively high level of luck (for a Wallace game) is a detriment, as everyone is equally affected (if you buy an unprospected area, that's your lookout). How much longevity it will have, I'm not sure, but very happy to play it at the moment.

Interesante juego de gestión de recursos y control de mayorías, sencillo y su vez profundo. Me gustó especialmente el sistema de control de los turnos. Me dejó un cierto regusto al Príncipes de Florencia, quizá por el sistema de subasta. A falta de más partidas, me dio la sensación de que la partida acababa demasiado pronto... Al igual que Caylus y tantos otros, parece no perdonar un par de malos turnos... Muy cerebral.

A strangely simple game system with a surprising amount of room for clever play. One of the best uses of a "time track" mechanic that I've seen. However, it is a little dry and bare bones. If you don't care for the strategy, it would probably be a bit boring. And I'm not always in the mood for it either. But it is a really neat little game.

An unusually light and streamlined game from Martin Wallace.  I like the re-implementation of time-based actions and the incentive to pass to secure early turn order in the next turn.  The money to vp conversion strikes me as clumsily done.  The random swings in commodity prices really can determine the game.  It's all so stripped down that after just two plays I'm wondering if there's anything left in this one.

I like the muted and evocative artwork of the Treefrog edition very much.  By contrast, the JKLM edition's is bright and twee and crap.

RATING: 7
Quick for a Wallace, but still plenty to think about. Tactical, good water and time points mechanisms, and good with three & four. Not one to play over and over-- but accessible for people who might not enjoy e.g. Brass, with a fair bit of luck to mix things up. So a great one to have in my collection.

The theme and mechanisms in this game really seem to reflect the notion that Wallace came across some ideas and a flash of creativity brought it all together.  A nicely produced game that has just enough aha moments.  A tad heavy for a super-filler role, you'll need to set aside the time to play it out fully.  Its not going to melt any brains, but it will tax you to make tough decisions - mostly about time.  And that is kinda cool.

Smacks of Wallace: a very thematic, economic game. Feels lighter than his other games that I've played, which is not bad, just noteworthy. I appreciate the randomness that the dice bring to the game; each play has felt very different from the past. The depth to time ratio produces a large return for your game play investment. 

Graphic layout of the first edition is quite possibly the worst I have ever seen - absolutely horrible. The JKLM version is significantly improved in this respect.

Tin mining in Cornwall (England).  Enjoyable light Martin Wallace game to kick off the Treefrog line.  Shows evidence of thorough testing (e.g. the fine tuning of the price modifiers in fourth and final round) that gives Martin's games the professional touch.  Turn order has shades of Jenseits and works well.  In my second game I was 'sunk' by getting waterlogged, but otherwise empty mines.  But I am happy with that level of luck/randomness.

Úgy látszik, Wallace-nek nem csak a legjobb játékai eredetiek, hanem ez a kevésbé(?) ismertekben is vannak jó ötletek. Itt pl. a pénz átváltása pontra elég kreatívan van megoldva (jó kis dilemma, hogy mennyi pénzt hagyjunk a következő körre), és a víz (milyen mélyről bányásszunk) is tetszett.

Ami a probléma, hogy a mi partinkban a játék 10%-ánál tudtam, hogy nem nyerhetek, igaz hogy egy kissé szélsőséges stratégiát próbáltam, de akkor is fura volt. A játékból gyakorlatilag ki lehet esni, de ehhez azért elég felelőtlenül kell játszani. Ha valakinek nem marad pénze, és a bányái kimerültek (vagy nincsenek), akkor nagyon beáll a játéka.
Bár dicsértem a pontozást, izgalmasabb lenne az egész, ha 1 pontmezőre csak 1 kis kocka kerülhetne. Így nem igazán éreztük a versenyt, persze lehet hogy ha több pénzt termelnek a játékosok, akkor így is izgi.

I was developing a hunger headache when we started playing Tinners' Trail so keep that in mind when gaging my rating and comments...

Anyway, I wasn't too impressed with Tinners' Trail.  I found the dice really random.  One player thought that the dice impacted everyone equally, but I see it differently.  For starters, there is an advantage in having Mines in adjacent regions.  However, the random dice can either make the unclaimed regions next to yours lousy, OK, or Awesome.  I understand that you still have to win the bid for the adjacent region, but it's worth more to you than the other players.  The other major die thing is that you are essentially trying to sell your goods at the right time.  Since this is randomly determined for later rounds, you either guess correctly or you don't.

First play with 3 players and I liked how it worked.  I set myself up for copper in the final round as it was at 4 pounds in round three; it ended up on 2 pounds in round four.  It was a calculated risk and it back-fired bad.  Good game though!

In my second game, I tried a similar strategy and copper finished at 4 pounds this time in round 4.  Wasn't quite enough to get me over the top as I tied for first and lost on the tie breaker.  I do really enjoy this game, but it feels a lot like there is a ton of gambling involved... maybe just a touch too much.

In my third game, I mined and sold copper early while it was valuable and built a lead while having few mines for the future.  Round 3 had low prices but the high prices in round 4 made it close again.  I won this time around but felt like it was too much luck.  I enjoy playing the game... I just recognize that there is a fair amount of luck involved.

This game was really interesting. With teaching, it lasted an hour and 15 minutes. Yet, it felt like a really heavy, long game--in a good way. I was really surprised that it took such a short time. I really liked the turn order mechanic, in which the more time (i.e., action points) you spend on your action, the further down the turn track it pushes you. The randomness of the ore prices really makes you have to think about what the right move is. In our game, the sell prices gradually fell each round, so as the purchase prices went up, our profits dropped, until in the last round, most of the copper was worthless. I definitely want to play this again.

RATING: 7
Note: I have only played the 2 player variant described here (https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/654837/new-2-player-variant) and my comments are based on this

This is a quick playing game that is heavily skewed towards tactical decision making. The heart of the game is trying to manage your time points and money (through standard auctions) to most efficiently build mines, upgrade them, and mine the valuable ore. At the end of each of 4 rounds, players sell all of their ore (at prices randomly determined at the start of each round) and then have the ability to buy victory points. The exchange rate gets worse and worse throughout the game, but it is also important to keep money on hand for the next round. There is some randomness with die rolls that could swing in one player’s favor, but for a short game this isn’t too big of a deal. I think it would play best with more players, but the 2 player variant provides a quick 30 min tactical gameplay experience.

This game is basically
a) bidding correctly
b) getting the best resources (adits, steam pumps, etc) before your opponents do

However, the time mechanism makes the auction really interesting (winning costs time AND money, which is a nice spin on things) and knowing which one of the resources is the best one for you can be somewhat difficult, sometimes (as, again, they cost time AND money).

The external investments part really bothers me, it feels really under-developed. It's almost as if there is no real game there, just the placement some cubes.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting economic game.  Modest amount of randomness in the "stock" prices and the "seeding" of tin/copper in regions, but the luck is manageable... and the randomness of the regions ensures replayability.  With 3 players, the game is considerably less tense (especially the end game).  Note:  It's hard to pump all of the water cubes out of a region, meaning that you usually have to spend money (on water penalties) to make money.  Also, the developments (ex. trains) in the last round make it easier to pump water out so you want to plan ahead and buy extra regions because regions that looked crappy for most of the game (ex. regions with 3 water cubes) become viable and possibly very valuable.

Lightweight Martin Wallace economic type game (lightweight for him, anyway). 

there's a random element of pricing for copper and tin (the 2 resources you mine in the game) and a range of aids to help you mine them - mines, miners, ships, trains, adits. 

Doing stuff costs you time and/or money, which is pretty clever, as if you are the player who has taken the least time so far, you keep going until you're no longer in that position. Resources get sold for money, money gets traded in for VPs. Most in round one, least in round 4. 

A quick Wallace game for when you don't have time for Brass!

Great bits, and the theme works for me. I even like the dice - chance is more realistic than certainty, especially regarding commodity prices and what's underground.

Definitely Martin Wallace's most "elegant" design. This game has simple mechanics that all work perfectly together.  The FUN factor is high on this game!  The time track works absolutely perfectly in this game and I honestly like the ability of players to make a key investment late in the round when their opponents don't have enough "time" remaining to participate.  Great, light game.

Almost no choice of possible moves - most of them are obvious one after another. Some random elements have more impact on final results than it seems. Also, almost no player interaction - only a few auctions of new mines from time to time. Finally, scoring table doesn't work too well - you can't really block any player with your choice of action.

Beautifully done and accessible Wallace game.  Nicely abstracted mining theme here.  Maybe a bit too much in the case of ships and trains.  Would like to have seen some more specialization with those rather than just the remove water/increase capacity.

Creo que ha mejorado visualmente con la edición del Viejo Tercio, pues antes parecía más abstracto. Es un juego muy equilibrado en el cual hay que pensar muy bién cuánto pagas en las subastas. Me gusta la mezcla de cálculo matemático, azar e interacción con los contrincantes. La única pega que le pongo es que está limitado a 3-4 jugadores.

Una auténtica delicia. Es un juego de 3 a 4 jugadores en el que se lucha por conseguir dominar la explotación minera en la zona de Cornualles allá por el siglo XVIII. La zona está dividida en diversas zonas de explotación en las que hay cobre y estaño. Pero extraer mineral está sometido a varias limitaciones. Para empezar, la capacidad de extracción, que hay que procurar mejorar. El agua que hay en la mina marca el precio de extraer cada mineral. Todas las acciones que realizan los jugadores tienen un coste en puntos de tiempo, y cada turno se dispone únicamente de 10 puntos de tiempo.
Según como se vaya gastando ese tiempo, el orden de juego va cambiando de forma muy dinámica. Al final de cada turno cada jugador vende los minerales extraidos para obtener dinero por ellos (es la úncia fuente de ingresos del juego). Con ese dinero se pueden comprar puntos de victoria, pero teniendo cuidado de quedarse con dinero suficiente para poder hacer cosas el turno siguiente.
Es un juego muy elegante y redondito. Las reglas son sencillas.
En mi primera partida me ha enamorado y le pongo un 8. Seguramente vaya subiendo con el tiempo. 

Adquirido a través de la bsk a Blackball (Oskar) por 25€, entregado aprovechando un viaje a Ikea.

A very elegant, streamlined Wallace that plays quickly. A very, very clever game. The random dice rolls for prospecting land and for price determination is highly thematic. It fits the game.

I like the inspiration that he took from Princes of Florence and from Jenseits von Theben.

Princes of the Renaissance and Tinners' Trail are my 2 favourite Wallace titles.

Good but forgettable. I'm getting tired of auctions in these types of games, and depending on where players are on the board, the random determination of resources can really reward some players over others. Scoring is also very weird.

I like the theme, though, I think the time track works really well here, and the game gives you some really meaningful choices on your turns. But because of a few flaws, not to mention the 3-4 player limitation, made us decide to sell it.

I don't really trust initial impressions when it comes to Martin Wallace's games, because so often good first impressions give way to ultimate frustration and irritation. But, I enjoyed one outing of this. It's so much cleaner than his usual stuff, and it plays quickly and at a good pace. I think, however, that the gratuitous randomness ultimately undoes it. You put a lot of thought into the game, but the swings on the market ultimately make more difference I think. Also on somewhat shaky thematic ground, as the cost for and opportunity to obtain infrastructure plays out somewhat strangely (infrastructure has to be paid for with time rather than money, but the time cost is so negligible that there is no decision there), but it's not bad by the standards of Wallace games. Anyway, I'll probably be done with Tinners' Trail after a couple plays, but be happy to play while it lasts. Overpriced for what it is, which is a run-of-the-mill light-to-medium-weight German game.

Finally a light-weight game that can scratch that Martin Wallace itch!  While I'm a huge fan of Martin's heavier fare, I just haven't been taken by any of his lighter stuff until now.  While there are still plenty of decisions to make in Tinner's Trail, the rules are all very simple and straight forward, lending it a much lighter feel.  Add to that the randomness of the dice and very reasonable play time (first game took slightly over an hour), and you get a Wallacey game that you might be able to pull off with even non-gamers, but is still fun for the gamer crowd as well.

Short playing time and clever 'time spent' mechanism. Should appeal to eurogamers. 

Unfortunately the highly random fluctuations in the tin and copper markets can make an enormous difference to players' income. I'm surprised that the regions weren't named or any towns or mine sites marked on the board. It would have enhanced the theme and given players a point of reference to discuss their strategies. The latest box artwork is truly ghastly.

Auction turf, extract goods, water makes them expensive to extract and increases with extraction. The time track is cool; actions have a time cost. Whoever is up on the time track gets to take an action. If they take a 'long' action, they won't get a turn for a while. Actions typically increase your ability to extract, reduce water, or some combination. After each of the four rounds, there is an opportunity to sell all your extracted goods at the current market price and buy victory points or keep cash for the next round. There is quite a bit of randomness with regard to the resources in the unseeded areas and the market. But the game isn't long. It is not particularly interesting, but not entirely without charm.

RATING: 2.5
It delivered slightly more than I'd expected, but I'd expected little.  The summary of the entire table was: "Nice enough game, nothing exceptional, not good enough to buy, could be persuaded to play again, the dice are annoying."

The dice really are annoying.  The VP market is also rather oddly contorted and along with the dice should probably have been developed out of the game.  What's left is interesting but not exceptional.  Unfortunate economic snowball, but it is possible that the ramp is low enough to overlook -- which suggests my real summary: overlookable.  A blandly nice enough game in a field full of nice-enough games: a couple warts, a few pimples, a nice smile -- forgettable, ignorable, unregrettable.

RATING: 8
Solid game, but has some rough edges.  Cosmetically, I'm not a fan of the money track that is in multiples of 20.  I would much rather have it be the standard 1s/10s breakdown.  Just have "$100" pieces if necessary.  I'm also not a very big fan of the points investment system.  Not an interesting part of the game.  

The mechanics are *very* thematic, and I do enjoy the time track greatly.  There's a decent amount of luck here.  I'm not sure how I ultimately feel about that.  The game isn't all that long, so it's probably fairly tolerable, but there are certainly some swings of chance.  I've had fun playing it and I'll play it a few more times, I think.  But I doubt it has the long term staying power.

An interesting theme, and the first of the Tree Frog games I've played. The production is great, a bit nicer than the usual Warfrog caliber. We swapped out the water cubes for some nice glass beads, which had a lovely effect.

The speculative nature of the markets is an interesting idea, but I'm not convinced it really works here. The early VPs are so cheap that I think you just go all out for what you can buy early. A little too much tactical pressure to really allow very interesting strategic planning. 

I need to play more. I very much enjoyed playing this one, although in hindsight I can't articulate exactly what it was that was fun.

RATING: 6
TT is a decent little economic game. Despite the locale and theme, it really has no similarities to Brass. Mechanically, it involves the use of time like Jenseits von Theben, economic optimization, an auction, the special actions that appeared in Way Out West and Byzantium, and a few dice. The game is very simple to explain, and is refined down into a pretty tight package. The goal of TT is simple: build mines, extract materials, sell those materials for profit, and use the proceeds to fuel future turns and to buy victory points. Along the way, water will cause problems by increasing the cost of mining, so a number of actions exist to remove it. Of course, every time one mines, then more water is introduced, so it's a constant fight.

Most of the player actions revolve around placing special pieces like the drainage ditch (I can't remember the proper name), the train, and the port which will remove water and additionally will do something else, like introduce more goods or allow for greater extraction for only one mine action. The more powerful special actions such as railroad and pumps are only available in very limited quantities and there is generally gamesmanship surrounding them. The ideal situation seems to be getting into a rich area, draining all of the water out as efficiently as possible, and then gutting it in one or two moves. The reason for this is the economics: one has to pay more to extract materials for each water cube present, and one has to introduce a water cube each time one extracts. So the best situation is to get rid of the water, extract huge amounts of it on the cheap and then leave the area vacant and water logged.

The board itself starts out seeded with several regions, and an additional number of blank areas are also present. At the end of each round, two of the blank areas are selected by players and have ore and water rolled for them. Players can also nominate blank areas as an action, bid for the right to put in a mine shaft as usual, and trust their fate to the dice. One generally does not [i]have[/i] to take their chances with the dice like that though, and can instead wait and see what is made available via the end of turn rolls and then plan accordingly.

The above is one place the dice are used, the other is to determine the price of the materials. This can have a significant impact on the game for copper in particular, because the variance between the best and worst roll is 6 pounds per piece sold. Tin is less volatile, The market is important though, as players have to be prepared to respond to a sudden spike in the price of either commodity, particularly copper, which at the highest price can swing the result of games. I don't find this quality particularly problematic though for two reasons. For one, the market is a shared thing, and players know how it works. I know that if copper is 4 pounds this turn, if I wait to sell my copper, it is probably going to be worth at least 2 quid more on a future turn, perhaps a lot more, so I can wait it out. The second reason why the market doesn't bother me follows from that: waiting means the money you gain is worth less for the purposes of winning, because victory points go up in cost as the game goes. So if you have a huge pile of copper and wait all game for it to skyrocket, and it does, you still can be losing relative ground because all of that money you just made is devalued. In essence, the dice create an interesting dynamic: cash in now and have the money on hand for buying more infrastructure and VPs, or sit back a bit and hope for a bigger return. One downside does still remain though, the market dice can make this a very make or break type of game. If copper tops out early and one player is in position to take advantage of that, and then the market tanks, the end game can be silly and pointless. The variation in VP values is already large enough from round to round to make late game digging bad, and this game can literally feature situations where copper goes from being worth 10 to 2, and the dice modifiers can help this along. When you pair this with the declining VP purchase values, having, say, a strong round 2 can literally win you the game in this on occasion. I find this problematic not in that I like games where dramatic last round victories are always possible (the best player should win) but because the nature of this is so unpredictable. Sometimes the dice will make going all in on a given round the best play, by far. Others, they won't, and there's not much a player can do about it other than tactically react to the current board and any potential modifiers to the market on the next round(s).

One other thing that bothers me is that the VP values decline round by round but don't increase in the same round based on the amount of cash you spend. I think this could improve the game because it would encourage players to spend larger gobs of money at once, even more than might be 100% wise, because the higher exchange rate pushed them into it. I think without some sort of dynamic like this, the VP phase suffers. While there is occasionally some intrigue or clever plays (more likely with 4 than 3 obviously) the overall implementation feels close to good, but not quite there for me.

Overall though for such a simple concept there is some interesting stuff going on. I like the reimplementation of the time mechanic and the Wallace action menu. The more I play it, the less I am interested in pulling it back out though. It's not a bad game for what it is, but because of the random market, players have to approach this game pretty tactically from round to round, and jump on the high scoring opportunities when they show up. I don't dislike it, and wouldn't mind playing it some more, but I don't see myself recommending this one anymore, just not enough meat to chew on for me.

Excellent lightweight game. The point buying mechanism suffers from irrelevance in the 3 player version. 

EDIT: 28 Jan 2010, I'm surprised this game has lasted so long with such a high rating. It has runaway leader issues. The randomness involved in price fluctuation of copper often determines the winner. I suspect that playing other, less random, games will eventually pull this rating down.

RATING: 5
In my opinion, one of the better, if not the best lighter Wallaces out there. Certainly more playable than Tyros and Tempus, in any case. The game itself is fairly straightforward, and bereft of long-term strategies: this is not possible to begin with given that new areas are stocked at random with metal and water cubes; and that players are not allowed to retain metal cubes from round to round. The clinger is the price of the metals: this is established by throwing dice and can really ruin any plans you had in scoring a big whopper of precious metal. Not a member of the Dice Done Right Club&trade; therefore. (Yes, I understand that's more or less intentional, to simulate the harsh reality of mining in those days... But that doesn't necessarily mean the mechanic should be present in a game.) The game becomes one of obtaining the maximum amount of money for the least amount of effort, while keeping an eye out on the turn order track lest a good spot in the investment table is blocked by the other players. But this is mostly tactical maneuvring. Not bad tactical maneuvring, and given the elegant mining mechanic even fun tactical maneuvring, but still, little to fuel my lasting interest. Tinners' Trail is perfect slightly meatier lightweight fare for families, though.

There's a lot to love here: the way the mine-flooding mechanics have such elegant repercussions and capture such flavour; the turn-ordering and action point system as well as the limited resources that turn the system into something akin to an auction - forcing you to weigh up the advantage of an item with the fact that it may deny you a shot at anything else...

The game feels highly interactive - maybe thanks to the shared map and items that can help a neighbour (viaducts and railways) and the fact that you need to predict what others want to do at the start of each 'turn', given the limited resources.

Continually growing the mines' 'power' is also satisfying and - unlike some games that involve building a 'system' (e.g. Puerto Rico), there's a sense of closure in that by the end, the mines will have been mostly depleted.

One complaint - the board is a tad ugly with the soft-photoshop-brush look to all the coastal side. Something with a hand-painted look would have fit the theme well and slightly improved the experience.

Also, the upkeep of adding a water cube after each mining is a bit of a nuisance to remember - we often forgot despite playing with one veteran and 2 2nd-time players.

The simple mechanics that evoke the mood wonderfully will definitely stay in my mind though and that raises this from a 7 to an 8.

2010-06-09

Simple mechanics with depth. I messed up horribly - should've mined for copper and gained extra money. In this game, I don't think you should ever rely on future developments enabling higher efficiency. I dream of having item on a previously waterlogged spot, taking 5 for 0, then the remainder for 1 each. Instead, it's a game in which continual progress should be made and good selling prices need to be taken advantage of.

Furthermore, making a mine more efficient may not be so efficient when taking into account the setup costs.

A real head-scratcher.

2010-06-15
Even though I lost 2 times, I still admire it. 

I'd happily play it again next week - there's JUST enough randomness to the game (in setup and prices). Enough that I'd happily play again with the same folk but judiciously place so as to not screw over any particular person. Although you can always take a gamble when buying a new plot of land and placing a mine...

There are some neat ideas in Tinners' Trail, but I think the scoring mechanism is really broken.  It tries to do something clever but ultimately falls flat.

Tinners' Trail is set in nineteenth century Cornwall. You are mining for copper and tin, attempting to sell when the prices are high. To reduce the cost of mining you can place developments, such as ports, adits, and trains. Once you have made your money you invest it in industries outside of Cornwall, which gains you victory points. The earlier you invest the better the return.

This may not be the best of Wallace´s games, however, is perhaps the one where its skills as game designer stand out the most. 
In fact, a game able to provide a glimpse to all the feelings connected with a developing industry, such as the investments, the sales income, the costs of buying and upgrading, etc, all within a frame of just four turns that take little more than an hour to play, with clear and simple rules, well, it´s a work worth credit.
Maybe some gamers dislike the fact that metal ores prices be set by dice, however, it goes with the theme of the game.

Se juega rápido, sencillo de aprender, pero con mucho que pensar y mucho por decidir. Buen juego en general.
Tras haber aprendido a jugar con detalle el juego empieza a brillar más de lo que en un principio parecía. Habrá que probarlo más.
Baja a 7.9, el juego está muy bien, todo lo que vas haciendo afecta al resto de acciones que puedes tomar y finalmente a los puntos de victoria, es demasiado enrevesado, podría estar mejor sin fuera porque este detalle.

That Wallace flavor, but unique enough in mechanics to keep it fun.  I especially like the VP track with the (sort of) auction mechanic.  Nice production value, as is expected from Warfrog/Treefrog.  I love the balancing mechanisms with the Time Track and the Victory Point boxes.  Very elegant design for a Wallace game.

An excellent, highly thematic game of mining in the Cornwall area. It is a very tactical affair, due to the mechanics of the high price fluctuations, and it has quite a splash of luck in the gameplay.  Now, these are things I usually hate in a game, but I must admit that I surprisingly don't mind them here, because it does feel sort of a natural thing for the theme it portrays, it adds some tension to the turns, and most importantly, it leaves you with a lot of room to manoeuvre and mitigate the bad luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Typical Martin Wallace fare - which is a good thing - although I found this probably the most anaemic of MW's games that I have tried. It still boasts some clever mechanics, which somehow capture the theme, and a fairly straightforward rule-set to create some interesting decisions for the players.

I'm not sure of there is a variety of strategic and tactical challenges sufficient to give this a lot of replayability but it will remain good enough for an occassional play and is simple enough to play without having to play constantly to keep the rules fresh.

I have managed to acquire an original Treefrog edition to replace my disneyfied JKLM edition.

RATING: 8
A fine, replayable, streamlined economic game which takes 60-90 minutes as the box says. We finished a 4 player game in a little over an hour today.

Just the right amount of "decision making under uncertainty" but not quite analyzable so there is less "analysis paralysis" which ruins many otherwise fine games.

RATING: 6
I got this at a steeply discounted price (about 10GBP), and don't regret the purchase at that price point.

The game is quite fun, and I feel like it represents the 19th century Cornish mining theme pretty well in its mechanics, with steadily dwindling supplies of ore in slowly flooding mines. 

The art on the board is perhaps not the most technically brilliant, but personally I quite like the overall effect- it's got nice colour and texture. It's not a completely dry map nor is it overly noisy and distracting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice, light economic game.  Takes the cool turn order mechanic of Thebes.  The value of the cubes relies heavily on the market.  So if you happen to mine cubes when the market is up, you're going to do well. But you can't wait for that day to arrive because you'll be out of money.  So it is a balancing act of how much to mine now and how much to wait for better prices.  I could understand if this turns off some, but it works well for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The time track is really what makes this game shine. However, the market prices are a little too random for my taste. Also, the scoring system does not present the challenge I believe was intended (or could have been). I would like to try a variation where each player only has 8 scoring cubes to use, instead of the usual 12.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Classic Wallace, an probably his best short game to date.

Each player is constrained by limited money, and moreso limited time. The auctions for the few good patches of Wales for mining are brutal, though the rest of the game is much more friendly tha the usual Wallace fare. Improve your turf and snatch up the improvements before your competitors do. 

Highly recommeded, better than Princes of the Renaissance, Perikles, Byzantium, Way Out West... possibly better than Age of Steam by virtue of how approachable it is.

Solid economic game about Cornish mining.   Sounds a bit odd, but the theme is well integrated and makes sense.   The money track is a bit cumbersome, but paper money or coins or poker chips would work fine.  The time track is borrowed from Thebes, but works maybe even better here.   Combining action points with auctions works well also.   The VP track might be a little suspect too, I'm not completely certain why there are constraints on the way you purchase VPs, since the constraints don't really seem to block anyone from scoring.   So, a few weird quirks, but overall a good economic game that lasts just the right amount of time.

The rules are a bit Martin Wallacey, meaning, not everything was clear the first read through (like Order of Play position), but good on the whole.

Gameplay was quick and fluid after one round of learning.  Lighter than many MW games, but not light.  Very glad I purchased it.

Tinner's Trail is definitely a lighter Wallace game.  The game uses Thebes method of 'lowest amount of time used becomes the active player'.  The game focuses on getting mines and improving your mines with various developments.  Once you have mines which are attained through auctions, you will be able to pay money to extract Tin and/or Copper based on how much water is in your mine.  After minerals are extracted water is added to the mine making future extractions more expensive.  The developments tend to reduce the amount of water in your mines or make you able to extract more minerals per extraction.  Tin/Copper prices fluctuate from round to round, with Copper being more volatile than Tin.  You sell your minerals to get more money and use this money to buy investment VP's which reward the early investors more than later investors.  Most VP's win.  I'm not sure how much I like it as I've only played it once and I don't believe with the optimal number of players yet.

Seeing a game about mining, I assumed it would be similar to other resource development games, but it's actually more about taking a risk on an investment. The game outcome is dependent on copper and tin prices, which fluctuate randomly - I'm not usually keen on random events determining outcome in a game of this length, though as the designer points out in the notes, this is pretty accurate to what happened to mine developers in Cornwall.

I'd play it again, but there are other games I'd be happier to see on the table. Overall it felt a little dry to me (despite mines being flooded left, right and centre). Still, I have to admire a game that allows cash-strapped players to raise funds by selling pasties!

RATING: 6.5
While there are some aspects I really like, I tired of the game after a few plays because the whole ends up being less than the sum of its parts. Let’s start with what I like.

The actions take varying amounts of time which affects turn order. Whoever has spent the least time takes the next action (sometimes more than one). Consequently, your action choices need to be made with consideration to how long they take and what opportunities will/will not be available by the time it comes around to your turn again. There is a very limited number of super cool mining/pumping developments available each turn so there’s plenty of tension in this regard. 

When you mine ore out of the ground, water is introduced which needs to be pumped. So now you have to consider spending precious time points to take water pumping actions instead of just mining actions. This ever present challenge feeds back to your action choices for the developments you take. The time-based action choices and the mining / water pumping see-saw are definitely fun and feel inspired.

After that, however, the game falls flat for me. I think the game is undone by how you buy VPs at the end of the turn. The VP chart decreases in value as the game goes on. For example, you can by 48 VPs for $40 on turn 1 but only 40 VPs on turn 2. While this sounds like a delicious decision, in reality this decline means people are clearly going to spend as much as they can for VPs which makes saving money for the auction round sort of a false decision. You have whatever you have left over after maximizing your VP purchase. 

Sure, you can hold some money back to use in the next auction, but with prices fluctuating via dice rolls each turn, our experience taught us to maximize VPs when you can because you never know how much money you’ll have at the end of the next turn. In fact, the way the dice create prices each turn, players may not have the ability to climb back into the game if someone jumps out to a big lead. The game may simply price them out of the competition.

RATING: 4
Objectively speaking, this game is probably better than my rating of '4' would imply, but it has irritated me in both games I've played.  It's a Frankenstein's monster in which a well-balanced economic engine game with a clever bidding mechanic is sewn onto a market-price lottery.  The effect of the price die roll can overwhelm the players' decisions.  In the most recent game the die roll wound up almost neutral for the two main contenders, but if it had been higher or lower it could have been a runaway on one side or the other.

I often find a significant luck element acceptable in a short game, and this is at heart a short game, so it's possible that my rating will creep up with more plays.  I'm not eager to play it more often at the moment, though.

(3-4 players) Downgraded: That first round (or two) is an absolute bitch and if you finish at the back of the pack it's pretty much impossible to make up the slack thanks to the decreasing return on VP's. You must tread *very* carefully early on or you can forget the rest of the game.

And other than figuring out how much to spend on auctions, your choices each turn are pretty obvious.

RATING: 8.5
I enjoyed Tinners' Trail very much.  Even though the rules are straight-forward, there's quite a lot going on for a game that only lasts 4 rounds.  It feels like a light "gamer's game" or a very meaty "family game".  There are many elements I like: 1) How the game's mechanics are closely related to historical real-life functions of the mining industry.  2)  The random initial setup is fun.  3)  The bidding for regions to place mines.  4)  I even like the random (but semi-controlled) ore market.  It doesn't annoy or ruin the experience.

My only gripe is the external market VP track.  The rules feel "clunky" with restrictions that don't seem to have a purpose or impact.  The external market is the ONLY way to score VP's, so I feel it would have been better to work out any kinks during this phase of the game.  This is the only reason that keeps me from giving this a 9+ rating.  Aside from that, I believe there is a wonderful game here.  Grade: B+

A simple economics game where edging your positions involves pumping water and building a reserve of unmined metals for the right moment to sell them.

RATING: 4
A serious economic game about ore extraction, where cash management - but intra-turn and over the game - is crucial. The game is too sparse and dry for me.

Duration: This is pretty easily two hours, and there can be a lot of calculation.
Design: I liked this; you spend time at the beginning of the turn taking the developments, then proceed to mine tin and copper, but only cash that in at the end of the turn. Auctions happen throughout and VP is purchased between turns with money.
Strategy: This game is about cashflow management. You take as many of the developments as you can at the beginning of the turn, and place them for maximum benefit. You then manage your money to extract and buy mines, and have to trade off early-game VP purchases with late game VP purchases.
Components: The board is plain, the components the standard wooden Euro-fare. However the development components look pretty funky (for wooden pieces).
Theme: I enjoyed the extraction mechanic with water making subsequent extractions more expensive, and the market price mechanic as well; the VP purchase was very bald however.

Update: I rate this game so highly because, like St. Petersburg, it has the lightest possible frame to support an interesting economic engine.  Light and frail with a sturdy heart.  

I admit I'm shallow, but I ordered this game because of the pics on the Geek.  Like Masons and Liberte, the in game photos have a board crowded with colorful wooden bits- it's sort of like looking at a gumball machine or a candy store counter.  I'm also a big Martin Wallace fan due to the amount of history that underlies his games and the way he's not afraid to include an odd ball victory condition.  Not nearly so cut and dried as so many more 'German' Eurogames.  His games are always trying to illustrate something that happened historically in simplistic game terms.  I think he does a great job of editing real life into wooden bits.  So far I really like the game and think the length is just perfect.  I like to play economic games from the gut and keep the math brooding to a minimum.  And as a math hater I can report that this game is lots of fun to play.  Everything works well here and the game plays as good as it looks.  Fantastic rule book as well as a great unique theme.

One of the simplest offering from Wallace. Slightly heavier than Steel Driver, but quite simple for such a strongly thematic historical economic game. This game is all about assessing the potential value of each plot of land. I was totally unable to do it in my first game, but am under the impression that this can be done quite precisely. In this case, the most important aspect might become timing and turn-order management. Or even the random variation of the market. Hence, my "7" is a tentative rating that will probably change as I discover what really lies at the heart of this game.

Another great economic game from Martin Wallace. I really like the role of water in this game (the more you mine, the deeper you get, the more difficult you have to pump water out, and therefore the more costs you have to pay). The theme and mechanics mesh together really well and it offers a decent amount of strategic options in half the time it takes to play Automobile :-)

It's a real shame Martin Wallace has gone to a business model of limited edition games.  The idea of coming out with a good game, but limiting it to just 1500 people in the world strikes me as bad for the hobby.  Ah well.  Tinners Trail is a compact design, with a nicely historical theme.  It is basically a few tactical elements wrapped around an auction.  Nothing special as far as board or bits, and a strange blocking tactic when purchasing VPs doesn't seem to come into play hardly at all --not sure why it's even included.  The game is short, and the swinging commodity prices on the two goods (copper and tin) have no chance to even out with only 4 turns.  If you happen to have the most copper available when the roll is the highest, well, you're the one to beat.  Still, it has its own unique feel, has ways to mitigate your luck, and is a solid game.  I'd definitely consider it if not for the designer label and relatively high price to purchase and ship to the US.

A game of turn order manipulation, resource valuation, and timing. Features one of my favorite mechanics of timing-an-auction-so-I-can-get-it-for-a-song. If this were a card-based auction game that played in the same time, people would rave over it.

3 games in now and I am enjoying this.  Beautifully laid out rules, with the thematic tie-in made explicit as each rule is explained - made it very easy to learn and to teach.  And I learnt a new word - adit.  While the game mechanics are slick and work well the theme of Cornwall tin and copper mines comes through very well.  The time track like Thebes works very nicely.  When you don't feel like something as heavy as Brass this may well hit the spot.

RATING: 8
The first release from Treefrog has me impressed.  While I don't like it as much as Brass, it has a nice feel to it that still messes with my head.  I love having to decide on whether to buy victory points and save that money for mining and upgrading in the future.  Compensating for water and the use of the timeline for actions and turn-order is fantastic.

I still prefer Brass for a longer intense game, but this was certainly an enjoyable alternative.

[b]Tinners Trail[/b] [i]Martin Wallace 2008[/i]
Gift of my friend Jogarmon. Tinners was the first Warfrog game released, a short and easy Wallace´s game that provides a lot of fun for three or four players during just one hour. Tinners is fast, has nice components and is quite easy to learn. Players only need to take care with the mine´s bidding (in order to not allow cheap mines to the other fellow players). The rest of the game is not difficult to master, sometimes options are a little bit obvius but all in all the game works really well.  In my book Tinners is a pretty good rotation game and I wont turn down a game of this good Wallace design. A gamer´s filler and an medium-easy euro classic game.

Tinners' Trail is an enjoyable game with some interesting pacing and budgeting tradeoffs to evaluate.  Yet I have an uneasy feeling about it.  Is the whole game really just one giant gamble on the results of the dice for the copper market?  Maybe.  I'm not usually one to complain about randomness or chaos in games but here it seems that the dice will often (not always) overshadow my tactics and strategy.  A copper market that swings unpredictably from £2 to £10 seems excessive for a game with just four turns.

No more money tracks in multiples £20 instead of £10, please.  It's an unnecessary frustration.  Also, the overwrought VP investment phase looks to me like dead weight.  I want either real tradeoffs or a smoother, faster method.

RATING: 7
I like a lot about this game but feel that it can happen that if you are behind because of the structure of the victory points investment chart you have to do twice as good later to catch up and then you are relying on the price of tin or copper to be any good. In my last game I was behind mined far more than the other players (having set up a mine for the last turn, passed earlier to maximise options) and the price of Copper was £2 a piece meaning I could never afford enough VPs to even remotely catch up. Yes, it could have gone the other way but it's very uncertain. 

You need to enter the game knowing that it is lighter and ride your luck.

I like this a lot.  Some would say a dull theme..its actually a fine and interesting history lesson and it earns extra marks for that. Potentially a must have economic game given that it plays in 60 minutes, is relatively simple rules wise yet still has some meat for gamers.  I hope I get to play this again soon as I have a feeling the rating will climb and will end up on my wishlist.  My only concern would be does it go the distance - is there enough here to keep it coming to the table?  Wonderful wooden bits with perhaps a board thats too bland for its own good (although perfectly functional). Finally; I'm a sucker for Cornish Pasties! :)

JKLM reprint arrived, awaiting playing soon. Pieces are all nice, I for one like the new boaard and tracks. The colours are much more muted than the previews published on BGG. Manual feels a little cheap - feels like some laser printed A3 sheets not printed edge to edge and like it might start to smudge after heavy use. Not really a problem though, as it probably won't get any heavy use, so this is just fine and dandy by me, as other components are fine.

RATING: 4
This game isn't as good as other Martin Wallace games like Brass or Age of Steam.  It's okay, but not really so fun to play.  Naturally, I object to the dependence on dice rolls!  You don't know what the value of tin or copper are until you roll dice.  And you might bid on an unexplored territory, and after winning it find that it has too few resources or too much water to be worth mining.  This kind of randomness can completely wreck a well thought-out strategy.

Another problem is that there is a lack of alternate strategies to win.  Each turn there is a sudden rush to take certain actions (steam boilers, adits, ports, rails) and once those are gone, there is no action to reduce the amount of water on the board (workers, pasty), no matter how many time points you have left.  So it's extremely important to get one of those early actions, which can be tricky.

The point scoring system is interesting, in that you have to buy your points at the end of each of the 4 rounds.  (It's a little hokey, though, in that you can't just buy as many points as you want -- each amount can only be bought twice.)  The interesting bit is that after each of the first 3 rounds, you have to balance buying VPs against your need for cash for the next round's auctions (and for mining in the presence of water).  And the points per dollar go down slightly each round, so buying points in earlier rounds is cheaper.

Overall, not terrible, but probably not worth playing given the many other good game choices available.

RATING: 7.5
An excellent "medium" level game which is easy to learn, but still contains difficult choices and a few tactical subtleties.

The market fluctuation (semi-random) works well, and I especially like the water mechanism which increases the price to exploit the mine (similar to the sand in Thebes).  One has to spend time removing the water in order to reduce operating costs, so you are trying to maximize the cost to revenue ratio.

The "time" mechanic also appears to stem from Thebes, and it works quite well in this game.

Last but not least, one has to purchase VP using your cash, which is usually not plentiful.  This forces players to make tough choices are the earlier you spend money on the "External Markets", the more VP they represent.

RATING: 8.5
A very good and interesting game from Martin Wallace. This is a lot about timing your production and balancing your actions,as prices of ore are fluctuating. The theme is mining tin and copper in the Cornwall region of England. Production cost is determined by the amout of water in the mines, and actions needed to drain water are essential to be able to mine the metals at a reasoable cost. There is also an auction mechanism for each new mining area. 

 The game has some of that characteristic Wallace feel to it, but this is very easy to learn and has complexity level somewhat below some other Wallace games, such as Brass and Automobile. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rather simple and quick.  My biggest concern is that this one might get bit old and repetitive after a few more plays.  I'm certainly willing to find out if that's the case and expect to enjoy at least a few more plays.

My third Wallace game, and after Age of Steam and Automobile, this was a big let down. Strange as it may seem that terrible money track (1st edition) seriously hurt my enjoyment of the game. I spent far too much time futzing around with the bizarro base-20 system and not nearly enough time making game choices.

The new edition fixes the money track, so I'll bump it up a point. It seems to be well-liked in my group so I'll probably play it again, but I consider it merely tolerable.

[Initial Impression: 6]
Interesting economic game without much depth to the economic model. Players auction off the ability to build mines (paying money and time), which they then improve with developments (paying only time), and then mine two types of resources (paying both money and time). Resources are sold to a predetermined, but random, market, and then money is converted into VPs via investments. Early investments pay more VPs, later investments, not so much - this makes for an interestingly front-loaded game, although a final push given a good market would be possible. Several interlocking pieces to manage, but the game feels relatively light despite this. To Wallace's credit, almost everything in the game seems to have a well-thought thematic justification.

Finally played this, and was quite happy with it. The first two rounds I was fishing in the dark, but later I got more out of it. I really like the victory point matrix, a welcome change from the "853 ways of scoring another 3 points Stefan Feld system". 
Tinner's trail is quite thematic, too. The decline of an industry is well visualized, although the game is quite mathematical.

RATING: 7
This was an intriguing Martin Wallace design, that seems to be the precursor to his [i]Last Train to Wensleydale[/i] and [i]First Train to Nuremberg[/i] games. Tinner's isn't a train game, but it behaves a lot like the just mentioned two designs. Like all of his games, there are some concrete, yet agonizing decisions to be made, and a push-your-luck element with regards to mining. I wouldn't mind trying this again, although I think I won't be getting this anytime soon. For now, its a '7'.

A lighter game by Martin Wallace standards, but with the usual historical theme. Similar decisions to Power Grid (do what you can now, or gamble on being able to do something better later), but it tends to be fairly linear. There's no incentive to mine early in a turn (a 'Sell Ore' action would have improved this) so you take the free upgrades while they're available, then mine later. Luck can decide the game, as market swings can be huge and completely unpredictable. I find this overlong at 75 minutes, if it were 30 minutes shorter it would be a great light Euro, but this goes down as another Wallace effort that would have been improved by more development.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unusual!  There's a heavy element of chance in the dice and the prospecting, but since the planning is so short range this MOSTLY affects players equally.  The exception is bidding on an unclaimed space.  There's plenty of tension as to whether your mines will pay off, and I like the drafting aspect of it, especially the way that the actions available increase as the game goes on.  It also reminds me pretty strongly of Princes of Florence, with the VP/money split (this, however, is much clearer than PoF) and the auctions.  (1 play)

Juego muy temático de Wallace pese a ser económico. Sencillo: menos exigente que un juego "de jugones" y con más enjundia que uno "familiar". Un buen juego para cuándo no hay tiempo para Brass o algún participante es demasiado novato para ello. Mecánicas destacadas: cada vez que perforas y extraes minerales añades agua a la mina (haciendo más cara la siguiente extracción), gestión del tiempo (sólo puedes hacer una determinada cantidad de acciones que sumen 10 puntos de "unidades de tiempo"). PROS: corta duración (en hora y algo está acabado). Reglas bien escritas, (podría ser un "gateway game" para los juegos económicos de Wallace).CONS: la adquisición de PV's (no hay diferencia en el precio al comprar un pack de 40 PV's o dos de 20. Gastas el mismo dinero y eso resta interacción entre jugadores). Hay azar y dados (oscilando muuucho el precio del cobre y algo menos el del estaño).

In un gioco di estrazione e vendita di risorse, originali alcune meccaniche: la modalità di eliminazione dell'acqua, che ostacola le estrazioni, e il fatto che le azioni più forti facciano consumare più tempo, che a sua volta è una risorsa limitata. La determinazione dei prezzi delle risorse tramite lancio di dadi, costituisce un elemento di casualità a mio parere eccessivo, rendendo ancor più rilevante l'aspetto tattico a danno di quello strategico.

Aug09:

Actually was better than I expected. From the rules all the developments seemed to be exactly the same. In practice they had a bit more personality between them.

It was odd that the most money and points was made in the third turn. The fourth was a little anti-climactic.

The whole "purchase vp" phase was just silly. It should have just been:

Turn 1: Buy 6vp per $5 you turn in.
Turn 2: Buy 5vp per $5 you turn in.
etc.

The whole "jockey for spot" was just stupid and didn't add anything but 10-15 minutes of game time.

The dice actually weren't that annoying. You had a good idea of what you were getting into.

Tinner's Trail has successfully illustrated the mining industry of Cornwall in England as a boardgame. The game has several noticeable charateristics in game mechanics. The main principle of the game is time track. A supplementary of mineral resources are mainly determinded by luck. However, players can refresh resources with game system. Luck and strategic factors are well mixed together and works without problems. Just like the real minings, the game is also realistically reflect the exhaustion of resources. This is one of the best game which combined a game with reality. Playing time is also not so long. Tinner's Trail is one of my best games ever.

Another Martin Wallace game I am ambivalent about -- almost love it except for some weird rules. I like the quirky historical theme, the just-wood-bits-and-a-board-aesthetic, and the economic aspect of the game. I don't mind the luck at all. What brings it down for me is how important it is to jockey for turn order by working the time track just right at the end of the round -- feels very gamey, doesn't seem to fit with everything else that's going on in the game, and rather spoils the theme.

Wallace scores again with this resource development game.  It illustrates some important elements of the economics of extractive industries.  Most importantly, the game models the interaction between the costs of production, and the market price of a commodity.  Can you say dimminishing returns?  This has been called a "light" Wallace game relative to Brass.  That does not quite capture it.  The playing time is still meaty.  We were clocking in at 2 hours with 4 players, and we are not slow 'round here.  The choices were certainly agonizing (and more open ended, compared to Brass).  Where Brass was an exercise in long term planning, Tinners rewards players who are able to capitalize on unexpected opportunity.  Furthermore, Tinners is elegant where Brass is particular.  Brass may ultimately be the better game, but if you have to explain one, go with Tinners.  Also, uncharacteristically, the game has a fine, clear rulebook.  This is a solid 8, and I would not be surprised to see it move to a 9, as Brass did.

Wallace has created something fresh again.  But it's not a blast.

This game is a mixture of light, joyful game with a healthy dose of strict calculation.  Mixture of dice-throwing with careful planning.  This is surely way lighter than e.g. Brass.

Only after 2-3 games I'm beginning to notice subtle nuances which decide about the victory.  Earlier I had an impression that the game might be a bit out of control.  Still, I don't know to which extent it is.

EDIT: This game hasn't got a spark and is unfulfilling so I decided to sell it.  It's a bit pity mainly because of the great Time Track mechanism implemented here.  

Sold.

RATING: 7.5
Very good shorter type economic game. Not really sure if it has true multiple paths per se and it could be fairly limited in scope as you just max out as much as possible for max gains. Best with 4, love the stock market aspect, pretty thematic, not sure about the luck I thought it was on the low side (prices but effects all players) but I see others saying it can be quite a factor depending on how people play. Because it also lacks multiple ways to score along with the other notes I made it can feel a little ‘samey’ quicker than wanted but the auctions and random setup will help here.

I'm not a fan of Wallace's games, but this one is OK. Simpler than Brass, more random, and unfortunately quite long anyway. Calculations towards the end of the game remind me Power Grid a bit, industrial look and feel of the board reminds Brass. The scoring/investing table could quite easily be skipped - you cannot effectively block others there, so just a price list would do. Random prices for the ore is quite disappointing because it can decide about winning from time to time.

The basic mechanics of mining and removing water were great, and the fluctuating market price for copper and tin is a good touch, but the external investment system didn't really work.  Unfortunately, that's what determines victory, so the game felt flawed.

Take my rating with a grain of salt.  I expected a heavier game and I played with three players which I realized is not optimal. Maybe next time I play it will be better since my expectations won't be so high.

**UPDATE** I have bumped this rating up a bit as I've played it more and more.  I can appreciate that this is a fine game and better than my initial comments. It still isn't one of Wallace's best games but it's no slouch either. If I wanted to introduce people to Wallace games for the first time or were playing with non-gamers then this would be the one I reach for.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely lighter than Brass and Age of Steam, but still requires doing math and quite fun!  Only luck is in the seeding of a province, and as long as you don't buy/place a mine in an unprospected province, and in the ore pricing, then it's zero luck (it just gives the game replay value by making the map different every time).

RATING: 7
Players mine for copper and tin in Cornwall, hindered by water in each area flooding the mines and making the prospect an expensive enterprise.

Compared to another recent economic Wallace game, Brass, Tinners' Trail is both much simpler and generic/abstract, has more of a luck factor, and doesn't feel as thematic. In fact, the game is not so much the kind of economic game it is trying to masqerade as, and more of a timing game, where being in the right place in the turn order is vital for success.

After a couple of games, while I did enjoy TT, it didn't "wow" me in the same way Brass did. The fact that the economic aspect of the game is as transparent as it is, and that turn order manipulation is as important as it is, was a bit of a disappointment. I don't think it is a game I need to buy...

RATING: N/A
First play (with 3) was about what I expected: great!  Second play (with 4) was even better.  Getting the maximum value for your ore is tough to speculate, but with developments and a few risks, things can fall together nicely.  Very simple gameplay but a fair amount of depth.

RATING: 6
Solid, short, Wallace-y game, complete with agonizing decisions and everything.  Played with 3, may be better with 4, and seems like it perhaps should go one more turn.  May like it more with subsequent plays.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (May 2017)

Martin Wallace is among my favorite game designers. I generally buy his games without knowing anything else from them and I´m always keen to try his games. Tinners' Trail was a hard/expensive game to get and I was expecting a lot from it. In some ways, the game delivers, but it other it is a letdown.

The rules aren’t too complex. You can teach them under 12 minutes. Playtime is around 90 minutes, which is pretty fast for a strategy game.

The art of the game is functional as are the game´s components, but nothing too exciting. There are blue cubes that have no relation with the blue player who also has blue cubes. They are a bit different but easily mistaken. They should be different colors. 

The theme is ok.

The game´s decisions aren’t too complex, but you do have to think all your options through. Most actions don´t have a financial cost but a time cost and the player who has the more time available will play next, that means, you can play several turns in a row, I like this system. In your turn, you can build a mine which later gets auctioned, mine ore to get money, build a port, a train or a miner to be able to mine more ore, build adits and steam pumps to get water out of mines. You can also sell pasties to get a little bit of money. Every time you build a mine or mine ore, more water is added to your mine and that makes mining more expensive, I love the concept. You can also pass and that decision is also important because it decides turn order and if you go first, you can prospect and invest first.

Another part of the game I really like is that you don’t get any VP if you don´t invest, so you need to decide how much to invest and how much to keep for your next turn, so your mining operation continues to expand. It isn’t a trivial decision.

Everything I have written above is positive for me, but the luck factor is the deal breaker for me. It is too much for a strategy game. You roll each turn to change the price of the tin/copper cubes and they can change radically from turn to turn. Your cubes can pass from almost worthless to extremely valuable in a roll. Also, every time you prospect or build a mine you also roll the dice. You can spend a lot of resources and get very little in return due to the dice. This luck makes thematic sense, but it sours the game experience for us.

It seems the game has too few water cubes, they ran out in our game, this is a minor issue though. Another minor complaint is that the money track doesn’t use multiple of 10s but of 20s, that’s weird and a bit inconvenient, but nothing serious. 
 
Bottom line, I like all aspects of Tinners' Trail but the luck factor, it is way too high for a strategy game and I feel it can decide the game outright, there is no way to control it :cry:. The game plays very fast and it is novel, but I will sell it as soon as I can. It is lighter than I expected, but still has a lot of depth and it plays very fast for a Wallace´s game.

RATING: 6
On one hand, it's hard not to admire the tightness of the design, and the time track for turn order (possibly most interesting new mechanic of 2008, see Neuland) is used very well here.  Diminishing returns on mining are classic Wallace.

I don't find the game light at all, which I think disagrees with the prevailing view, but that's a compliment coming from me.  There aren't enough 60-minute heavy games on the market.

On the other hand here are the reasons why Tinners' Trail doesn't work for me (3 plays):  

* It's very stripped-down, and ultimately I love me some chrome.  

* I'm not connecting much with the theme or the theme-mechanics blend, which is odd as I find Brass very thematic, and it's basically the same theme welded on basically the same way.

* The game doesn't want to be played the same way I want to play it.  I never care for the short term money grabs, and one really has to grab and sell as much copper as possible at the 8/10 pound values.

Obviously a good game, obviously not for me.

RATING: 7
Wallace has another classic here.  The use of the time track mechanic with the player interaction is superb.  You must compete (bid) for the better mining areas, but not waste too much time or money or the other players can greatly benefit.  Plays quickly (75 min for a first game) and speeds up significantly from there (45 minutes can be common with 4 veterans).

The occasional dice rolls, while thematic, can significantly alter the outcome if a player gets an incredible or horrible roll.  For that reason, Mykerinos maintains its title of best game in an hour, IMO.

Another Martin Wallace game with typical [i]functional[/i]™ (euphemism for ugly) art. The game plays in about an hour and that's a perfect length given the random prices for metals. In that hour you'll get a game that gives you a nice balancing act between money and victory points and balancing actions with turn order. All in all smooth game play with easy to grasp rules and plenty of player interaction. Game could do with some player aids instead of the backside of the rule book, but luckily BGG has some outstanding ones.

Good start for the Treefrog line. The decisions in this game are not as exquisitely difficult as they are in my favorite Wallace games, but you get a good taste here of his unique economic stylings. The theme is well suited to the mechanics. This game couldn't be about anything other than tin mining in Cornwall!

Un juego bueno y rapidito, se puede jugar en 45-60 min.

En el tablero puedes ver distintas localizaciones donde puedes encontrar Laton y Cobre, tambien puedes encontrar agua, que representa el coste de extraccion. Los jugadores pujaran por un sitio para ser capaces de extraer alli. Ademas pueden comprar desarrollos para hacer la extraccion mas barata/mejor. Despues de una ronda completa tienen que cambiar sus minerales por dinero y entonces usaran ese dinero para comprar puntos de victoria.

Es un juego para 3-4 jugadores, pero se puede encontrar una variante muy facilita para poder jugar a 2... y realmente funciona.

A good and fast game, you can play it in 45-60 min.

In the board you can see different lands where you can find Tin and Cooper, you also will find water representing the extraction cost. Players will bet for a land to be able to mine there. In addition they can buy developments to make extraction cheaper/better. After a complete round they have to change their minerals for money and then they will use that money to buy victory points.

It is a 3-4 players game, but you find a very easy variant to make it work for 2 players... and it really works.

RATING: 5
Let me begin by saying that the game has many good things going for it: easy to teach and learn; lovely components (JKLM); good playing time (60 minutes). The game itself boils down to turn order and bidding correctly. 

Going first gives you first crack at all the available supplies, bids, actions, and most importantly the investment track. If the player going first plays it right he/she can manipulate all future turn orders and in doing so the entire game. 

I've read people griping about the random copper/tin market but I feel it pales in comparison to controlling turnorder. The game has a sorta reverse economic snowball engine (investments become less valuable as the game goes along) and going first has a decided advantage as it pertains to the available investments. 

Recommended as a lighter Wallace, particularly for those who enjoy bidding correctly and economic snowballs.

RATING: 8
A lighter Wallace game (compared to Brass) about Tin-mining in early 19th century Cornwall. This is the nearest thing to a "gateway" game that Martin Wallace has ever made; in fact, it could be seen as a quirky introduction to Wallace's unique brand of design. Tinners' Trail de-emphasizes auctions (for mining rights) in favor of Thebes-style time management (for example, you could spend a month using steam pumps at one of your sites or two months developing a harbor nearby). The core mining mechanism stands out as something new: as more ore is extracted, the mines deepen, more water enters the mine-shafts, and each additional unit of ore becomes more expensive to extract. The game is less about tin and more about water, which can be pumped out, diverted, drained into harbors, and harnessed for railroads. The game's goal structure is deceptively simple: strip the land, invest the profits. The more I play, the more difficult it is to measure players' clear investment position against their board position. 

I can see how some might be tempted to compare this to Brass because of the similar themes. Brass is rich and expansive; Tinners' Trail is lean and elusive. I prefer Brass, but have a growing love for Tinners' Trail.

This game is great in every aspect. Easy to learn, but seems quite difficult to master. In our first play, I initially found it a little difficult to remember update everything after each action (money track, time track, cubes), but after a while it got automatic.
In terms of game mechanics this game contains all the elements I like: auctions, economics, action point allowance system, a very nice time track for seting the order of play, and I really like the way You have to buy the VP after each phase (similar to Princes of Florence).
Overall a Great game!

The whole is greater than the sum of the parts, but some of the parts are really not to my liking. To wit: Price of tin & copper can vary, which is interesting, but they rarely do, which is boring. Standard auctions are generally not a winner with me, and it's worse when a person can put something up for auction and automatically buy it for $X because nobody else has $X or more. I like the ability to game the turn order, but I don't like how important turn order is. Printing things on the board in different orientations may have seemed clever in theory, but in practice it's just silly.

RATING: 7
I'm not sure if this really is a 7/10 for me. But to be fair I don't give a 6/10 initially because I might suffer from a negative bias due to being out of the race for the win after the second of four turns and there's more to this game than can be discovered in a single game.
In direct comparison I like Wallace's Steel Driver better. Tinners' Trail has some rough edges which could have needed a bit more development. The choice of actions diminishes in a four-player-game to practical non-existence by the middle of each round, the table for buying VP's only costs time and due to its linear nature doesn't really add any value and the money trail based on the number 20 complicates calculations unnecessarily. I'll have to see if the luck in determining ore prices bothers me when I'm still up for the win in the last round. I'll have to give the game credit that there's enough room for making the wrong decision to make it worth playing more.

Very enjoyable, fast moving design. Strikes the right balance between speed and tough decisions. The theme is not tacked onto the system as an afterthought, but permeates the game throughout. Another winner for Wallace and a great beginning to the TreeFrog line. Can be easily played twice in an evening. I believe that it actually has LESS luck than Brass. Brass cards are drawn blindly and bad draws can hamper one's play. In TT, most of the cubes are on the board allowing one to hedge one's bets.

RATING: 5
I really enjoy the unique theme of the game and appreciate the relatively quick playtime.  I feel that the game was made to be played at a brisk pace.  While there are many decisions to be made, I suppose one can calculate what everything is worth, continually keep track of who has how many points, and play an optimal game.  But if this drags the game out, the game feels less fun.  I don't really have a problem with the dice, but it seems like the dice can strongly influence how the game plays out.  In our last game, high early dice rolls meant that most mines were empty by the end of the game, leaving some players nothing to do but sell pasties.  I look forward to seeing what Treefrog has in store for the future!

A light Wallace. I like the offbeat theme. Money is very tight and there is a race for the better mines and valuable copper. We are still learning auctioning, I guess, it is a never ending process. Beautiful components! The mechanics wonderfully fit in the theme, a very well designed game, neat and compact. I like pumping the water out and adding various supplies to increase capacity and lower the price of mining. I love the feeling of history:taking part in great mining projects in England in the 19th century.

2015-11-29 - Pretty good typical (I think) economic Wallace eurogame. The theme is not very engaging at the first sight but everything make sense there in that regard and the game works really smoothly. I'm not a big fan of auctioning, but here I am able to estimate how high I should bid. The game doesn't take too long (hour maybe) and as I don't have something similiar in my collection I will probably keep it for a longer time. I really like the time table mechanism.

2016-07-09 - 7 -> 7.5 - Finally we managed to play it again and this is a really good game! When you read about mining, tin, copper and miners it seems like the most boring theme there might be. But after you start playing it's very engaging and exciting!

2016-12-28 - 7.5->7 - It's hard to bring it back on the table however I still keep it.

Martin Wallace game that is best at 4 and plays in about 75-90 minutes. Auction game where you bid for parcels of land and mining rights, and you build improvements to help extract and sell the copper and tin. Very simple to teach but the decisions are surprisingly hard and have many ramifications, lots of player interaction both in the auction phase and with improvements that potentially benefit your neighbours too.

Nice middleweight economic game - a fun easy to play game that has a logical treatment of tin and copper mining.  The theme is good, and the play is brisk.  I enjoy the time mechanic and the brinksmanship of the auctions combined with the management of time and money.  Some nice considerations to weigh as you play.  But best of all is the game is fast!  A 3-player game can be played in 60 minutes if everyone knows how to play.  A 4-player game may run closer to 90-minutes; which isn't quite as impressive, but still worth the playing.

Very well executed game by Martin Wallace. Quickly explained it offers lots of strategic possibilities in a reasonable short playing time. 
And it´s dripping with theme - one can imagine why the steam engine just had to be invented at that time.
The only reason I won´t give this a higher rating is the ore price mechanism where you just roll dice to determine the selling price. Especially in the last round a low price can pretty much spoil your plans.

Lots to like here, like short-ish playing time, the way mining gets more and more difficult the more you mine, and actions costing time (a nice mechanism which I'd like to see used more often than just here, Thebes and couple of other games).

On the negative side the game is so simple and devoid of deeper strategies, that it's going to play out pretty much the same each time and thus get old fast: I downgraded Tinner's Trail from 8 to 6 after just couple of plays. It's also undercooked in several departments, for example scoring seems like an afterthought and there are not enough water cubes in the box.

Nice quick wallace.

The time track is well used here. 
he three player game is much loser than the 4 player gamer.If you are used playing this 4 player I predict a loss in the three player game. Evaluation of thingd is different.

I wouldn't play with three because I likie how tight and tough it is with 4. 

The other thing that is quite brilliant is that most points can be scored in the opening round. 
The market when prices are low you try to setup for the next round. But this can backfire. So it's also about risk management. 
This game will never leave my collection allthough I'm thinking to put the treefrog version up for trade or sale

Played several times.  Boy, did I like this game more than I expected, and I thought I would like it.  Is it even better than Brass?  Maybe.  It is very hard for me to judge a game after I've won, so I really needed to play again (and lose?) to solidify my rating (mission accomplished...).  After the second game, the rating falls just a little bit, because the dice were SO horrible to everybody, and essentially eliminated one player; I thought this was an anomaly, until the third game, when it happened again.

A very clever resource planning business game simulating the Cornwall history of building mines, creating developments that help to extract water and selling ore (copper & tin) for profit.  Very good industry game.  Doing this properly gives you a good cash flow but when do you spend it for investments (in VPs) versus save some more or less for the future rounds to mine, develp and extract ore...?  Very clever board mechanism for this middleweight game.

Excellent, short economic game where you seek to mine goods to sell at a good price.  Darn that water though!  Somehow it keeps seeping in those mines and making life miserable and more expensive to get the goods out of the mine!  Wallace really combined some interesting mechanisms in using a turn track like that of Thebes to determine who's turn it is with different action selections and dice rolling to determine the selling value of the goods.

If you invest wider, control your spending, and take care with your turn order there's little that luck has to do with here.

I really like:

- When you mine future mining costs rise
- Adits and trains give motivation for consolidated building and the chance for synergy.
- The bonuses of the developments still apply when an area is "explored"

Play is brisk thanks to the time track, which is a mini-Neuland mechanism :)

Another play:

The random market is evil and the tougher/more favorable the market, the more ferocious the bidding is. The wilder the swings the more fun this game can be. 

I do have concerns that there is a high potential for draws given the way external investments are proportioned.

Speelt zeer aangenaam, met enkele leuke mechanismen - maar het feit dat de prijs van tin en koper wordt bepaald door dobbelstenen bepaalt toch wel in behoorlijke mate de overwinning. De geluksfactor in zo'n strategisch spel is dus toch wel té groot

There's water in those mines. There is also gas or maybe that was the two old guys I played with that had gas. Anyway I need another play on this one. It was not as great as I hoped for.I liked it better after a couple of plays.

i really like this game.

i like the time track and the tension of trying to do more things, and wait for other people to pass so you can snag land cheaply, and also trying to decide whether you should pass early so you can get the first developments.

A very thematic mining game, where you are bidding on land with money.  You build mines and then can improve the mines to remove water which increases the cost of mining.  You can also add other things like railroads and adits, which make the mines more productive.  

You mine tin and copper and sell to markets where prices were determines by a die roll at the start of the turn.  

You can then buy investments that give you victory points.  

The game plays relatively quickly and like most Martin Wallace games, the theme fits the mechanics.  But also, like most of his games the art and components are spartan. 

I do like the game and it is a solid game I would typically  play.

Many of [person=6][/person]'s games have rules that with idiosyncrasies and exceptions: [thing=28720]Brass[/thing] and [thing=38309][/thing], for example.  [thing=35570][/thing] is not one of those.  The rules for [thing=35570][/thing] are simple, the game plays fast, yet there's enough depth to make it interesting.  For a game that plays in about an hour, there's a lot of decision-making in this one and the randomness is not so much to bring chaos to one's plans.  All in all, a good, solid game.  It's just unfortunate that my wife doesn't enjoy it as much as I.

One of the lightest Wallace games I know. Bidding is essential in this game and winning depends on details and good bluffing. 
As with all Wallace games, this game is thematically great and it's clear a lot of thought has gone into modeling the real situation as elegantly as possible. 
This game could be used in a history class at school in the UK.

Not bad, but I'm not sure how much replayability it has. The real decisions seem to be the mine auctions, the other choices aren't necessarily obvious, but are not game changers. The fluctuating market prices of tin and copper throw in an odd luck-element into an otherwise very analytical game.

RATING: 8
A nicely themed economic game that doesn't require extensive planning but does provide some interesting economic decisions in the face of uncertainty. As the game progresses, the reward for risk diminishes, so an early 'good move' can win the game quite easily, especially as it can be hard to recover from a poor first round. But the uncertainty of the metal market means all is not always lost.

RATING: 8
Two things prevent this from being a great game, IMO.  The first can be easily fixed by ignoring it.  That's the buying VP phase.  The around the table purchasing and artificial jockeying is largely pointless.  The second is random ore prices.  For a game of this weight and length those random prices can make building for future turns too risky.

Yet to play, hence the no rating. After setting it up a few times it seems like a typical Euro. I'm a little suspect about how good this could actually be (I love Brass and AOS) with its rather forced theme and possible obtuse economics system.

Update: 1st play with 4 players. It's a solid game with a mix of several different mechanics (bidding, time / order thing, VP buying). It will probably get better with more plays, but it's almost uninteresting.

An engaging economics game that's plays in 60-90 minutes.  There's some pretty interesting decision making when choosing actions, when to buy a mining factory (and for how to pay) and probably most importantly when to sell goods and buy victory points.  Also, there's a bit of gambling involved with the commodities roll before each round.  I found out the hard way that if you put your faith into one type of commodity it could bite you at the end.  Speculate broadly!

Economic game based on Tin Mining in Cornwall. All wooden components, nice heavy mounted board and very clear, readable rulebook. Contains maybe too much luck for pure Euro gamers (the price of Tin & Copper fluctuates based on initial dice roll each turn) but there are lots of options and calculations to keep the brain burning on a low light. The game is actually pretty simple to learn (my 7 year old easily got the hang of it) but has sufficient depth to keep one engaged. Also, game plays in about 1 hour so definitely not a drag.

This one left a positive first impression in 2011. Quick enough game, just 65 minutes (of which 20 minutes was spent on the first round!), making this a rather pleasant experience. The dice made the game fun and the water is simply a brilliant mechanism.

Hmm, just didn't really get into this one.  The theme doesn't grab me and I'm not sure I want to play again.

Thanks to Ken for teaching me this and letting me play, though.

RATING: 6
This game definitely had more luck than I prefer, but it is a fast play and is about speculation after all. In fact, I strongly prefer this to Gnomes of Zavendor as a "speculation" game, though that is perhaps not saying much. In other words, if I'm going to play a speculation game, I'll accept that luck plays a part, and this is the game I'd play. As you'd expect with a Wallace game, the rules take a little longer to explain than you'd prefer, but, once you play a round, everything makes sense and flows smoothly. I'd play again for sure.

The revised charts (by JKLM) around the map are very clear and help the flow of the game.

Wow, a Martin Wallace game without convoluted rules? Who knew? I enjoy this one a lot. The randomness of the ore prices clearly annoys some, but I love how Wallace justifies it all in the rules.  A few nit-picks: The money track is a pain to deal with (Using multiples of 10 should be universal law), the external investment track seems like an afterthought, and there's the price tag. $55-60 is asking a lot for a 60-90 min game. Despite all that, I can't help but want to play this more, and I've definitely gotten my money's worth.

Like other Martin Wallace games, the theme closely connects with the game mechanisms, and it's quite easy too. The system works and does reward skillful manipulation of game state, however it feel a bit flat compare with other games of the same genre.

RATING: 7
Players are mining copper and tin, then selling them at market prices, then exchange money for VPs. The game last 4 turns, with the price of copper and tin determined by dice rolling. Players must make decisions on whether to purchase land with water (which makes it more expensive to mine), mine the land which adds water, add boats to decrease water, add a train to get rid of water, but help adjacent areas, add workers to mine more per turn or play an adit to reduce water. This game uses the time mechanism from Thebes so players take turns on who has used the less time. VPs purchased on earlier turns cost less than in later turns.

It's a decent game that moves crisply. Since the copper and tin prices are determined by dice rolling, one can't have a long term strategy, other than to react to the prices. Some may not like this sort of game. You do have to give yourself the flexibility to sell if prices are high, and to develop infrastructure if prices are low, or make some decisions around that. If the prices stay low all game, then everyone will have a low scoring  game. The mechanice to purchase VPs seems a bit artificial in that only 2 players can purchase the same lot of VPs, but perhaps that is to reward the person who is going first. I like the game, it is a decent Martin Wallace design.

With so few options available, there really doesn't seem to be that much to think about. There are a few spaces on the board which are obviously better then others, and it should be obvious by which spaces you've taken which items are best to buy. The only real complication comes with the bidding in the game. Since you want to save as much money as you can to buy the victory point spaces, you have to be careful about how much you spend. Might be worth a second play, but there really isn't anything about it that really caught my interest.

RATING: 7.5
It is a medium to light economic fast game with a nice deal of decissions, some luck and plenty of interaction. 

The rules are pretty simple. The thing new players will have most trouble with is remembering what each mine upgrade does, but there's a very useful reference table that will do that for you. 

The theme is not inspiring, but all the rules and mechanisms are perfectly integrated and the games does not feel abstract.

Even if there's a high degree of interaction and meaningful decisions, the game progresses very fast and veteran players should be able to finish a 4 players game in around 1 hour.

It only has a luck/random element, but it is very important: the prices. It can decide games, but it will also create tension and give hope to everybody.

First impression (4 players): The game is a Wallace economy game both in good and bad. It's quite easy in rules but not very forgiving. I can see how some might hate dices as you cannot really plan anything for areas without resources until they come there. There could be lots of them in easy to mine place or just handful and hard to mine. You'll be balancing between keeping more cash for the next turn or buying points early. The more early you can get them the cheaper they'll be but then money is out from your future invests. Also as passing early gives you better options in next round, there is enough hard options to think about. The game felt a good lighter economy game.

Un Wallace a mio avviso passato troppo sotto silenzio. Il gioco è molto profondo e strategico anche se di durata contenuta e tutto sommato non difficile da apprendere. L'asta e la scelta del momento opportuno per investire sono importanti e permettono di approcciare il gioco con differenti strategie; gioco dalla fortissima interazione. Apprezzabile anche il tentativo di ambientazione evidenziato nella lettura del regolamento che trovo ben scritto (e tradotto).

Very pleasant linear economy game - a sort of forerunner to Automobile with lots and lots of wooden cubes to toss around. The Cornish mining theme and its integration is a total delight. Virtually luck-free given that the auction element negates the randomness of the dice, which is rather clever in itself. Requires four players of equal ability, otherwise there's so much runaway leader it's not funny.

El juego de la minería del cobre y el estaño en Cornwall en el siglo XIX. Tienes que explotar tus minas para ganar dinero, con el problema de que cuanto más profundo excaves, más agua entrará y por tanto será más caro extraer nuevos minerales. Es para 3 o 4 jugadores, aunque yo solo lo he probado a 4 (y creo que a 3 pierde mucho).

The entire game feels very thematic. The mechanisms do a good job of replicating the nature of mining. Nonetheless parts of the game feel clunky, particularly the recording of money. The clunkyness means that it seems a slightly unsatisfying experience.

This has lots of nice things - water makes extraction dearer, you can invest to reduce water damage, extract for money, spend money to get points, but you want to keep money to make more money later. I liked the time track, I liked the tightness, I liked the luck of the commodity pricing and the prospecting. I wished the vp track was a little more exciting, tense, thematic, non-linear, but you can't have it all. Good game for its length.

This is a surprisingly light game, but that is still a gamers game. There are not that many options each turn and you have 10 hours worth of time to spend in each round. You build plants and extract minerals in order to sell them on the current market and then trade them in for points. There is a fair amount of interaction as you fight for a limited amount of special moves and plant locations. Well worth a try and can be played in about an hour.

This is an optimization game where you're trying to mine as many goods as possible with a given budget, but water keeps seeping into your mines, making it more expensive.  There is a small random element in what goods appear in new regions, and how much goods are worth each turn.  You want to sell lots of goods and spend your money early while the ratio to convert it to victory points is very favorable, but it's difficult to have a very good economy in the early game.  Overall, the game was pretty interesting, but it didn't really have anything that set it above other games.  Just seemed to be missing a "spark" or something.

Update: I must change this rating after all (from 9 to 8). TT is still a very good game, but it is lacking that special something to be up there with the truly great. Also after some time I come to realize that the outside investment phase (buying VP:s) seems under devoloped and a bit pointless. 

***

Played more: This is a solid 9.

Excellent game. It reminds me of a sleeker, more polished Brass. Where Brass is a bit opaque, Tinners’ Trail is transparent and easy to overview. This also echoes in the slightly dry and understated (but pleasant enough) artwork. But the gameplay is nevertheless highly thematic and fun. 

Rulewise Tinners’ Trail is relatively easy to comprehend, but the game itself is still something of a brainburner and it’s totally unforgivning if you play reckless. The more complex (rulewise) Brass, actually feels more forgiving.

I've only played once but I'm eager to play again. I predict that replayabillity is strong with this one.

I'm not really sure of my rating here. Usually my fondness to these economic games is lower than anything but this game felt a little different. Some auction, luck and abstracted transportation mechanics were actually quite good. This game didn't have the exhausting optimize-until-dead aspect like so many other economic games tend to have.

Luck-dependent resources in an area is both pro and con for this game. The bad thing is that the area you spend a lot of your money and lay all your hopes on gives you max water (water is a hindrance in this game) and a couple of other resources... you really want to throw the board away.

Anyways, my point was that this game was actually nice experience. The wooden components fulfill their function and the VP purchase suits fine into this type of game.

I was told this is the lightest of Wallace's games. I went on to win my first game thanks to some proper coaching from my fellow players. It certainly does feel like your options are relatively narrowed down to the point they are very meaningful but you don't need to overthink what to do. There are a couple fiddly rules to keep in mind but nothing too bad. I would definitely play this and if given a good bargain probably get a copy.

The 2nd Martin Wallace game I've played (1st was Brass).  Great game and I really like Wallace's approach to game design where he obviously takes a system/process and makes a game out of it, but attempts to simulate it with game mechanics as close as possible.  

This game suffers slightly from adhering to that methodology too close with the random prices for tin and copper.  Apparently this was done because that's how volatile it really was, however in the game it doesn't allow you to plan much of a multi round strategy.

Still a great game with some excellent mechanics.

For trade - because I can't see my game group wanting to play this very often.  I would be reluctant to see it go though.

After one play there is more to think about than first meets the eye. Balancing action points and cashflow while evaluating provinces and deciding where to focus your efforts is a lot to process.

RATING: 7
While the design of this board might be a crime against graphic design, the game is really fantastic. The general idea is that you want to mine the orange and white cubes from the board, but the turn you mine those cubes is the turn you have to sell the cubes. The rate the cubes sell at is determined by an averaged die roll at the start of each of the 4 rounds, so you have to sort of push your luck as to when the best time to sell is. To add more tension, every round the dollars to points conversion gets a little worse. You can also take actions to cheapen the cost to mine cubes in certain spots, and you can bid to explore new areas, which then get a random number of cubes after you win the bid, so you don't know exactly how much the spot can be valued at. The game also has a fantastic action points system where the player who has spent the fewest points is the active player, so at times you can line up multiple actions in a row.

RATING: 6
Parts of it are brilliant. I love the mining mechanic, where water cubes increase the unit cost of mining and every time you mine, another cube gets added. I also like the investment model where you buy VPs at the end of each turn; the rate is better earlier, but if you invest you have less cash on hand to develop infrastructure. But I don't like the random, rather than player-determined, variation of the market prices; copper especially can have its value doubled by one extra pip on the dice. And it also felt like there wasn't quite enough stuff to do to fill the turns and that the order of actions within a turn became rather formulaic.

I think I'd like the game better if selling tin/copper was an action, and the price dropped each time someone made a sale. Then you'd have to consider whether to mine early in a turn rather than just grabbing the developments until they're all gone. The auctions I'm not sure about; like the ones in Chicago Express, the sale price is determined more by turn order and liquidity than by actual value. That can be interesting but sometimes feels a bit 'gamey'. As does the arbitrary constraint on the available investments; one of those usually irrelevant but sometimes irritating mechanics that should have been developed out.

RATING: 7
Wallace strikes again with an elegant design. Everything fits together nicely and works well. There is an nice balance between how to spend your actions, how to invest your money, how much to bid etc. This game will work well with people that are good at bidding games, if you have someone who misprices the market he will skew the game for the others. Mind you, they won't sruvive the rest of the rounds and will get spanked with no money. Another fine game from Wallace.

Update: Second play: bumped game rating higher. My impression has improved, tighter with 4. The end score is usually close between 1 and 2 at least. I like the added gambling aspect. I tried carrying more money forward into later rounds for mining, gambling that I could mine the ore from all my mines and make more money. However, I couldn't do that and invest early so lost out of valuable points. I still would like to see if its possible to win in the later rounds by carrying a lot more money forward. If the prices of the commodities stay high it could pay off, if not you're busted. It fits the theme very nicely.

3 rd Play: After the third session I started to see just how much influence the dice can have on the outcome of the game. There is that gambling aspect as mentioned before. You can carry over more money into the next round and hope to cash in if the market prices go up. One of the players in our last game had a horrible first round but lucked out in the second and made $80. That gave him the win, which was dumb luck. As a result, I'm downgrading it just a bit.

RATING: 8
Very clean set of integrated mechanisms leading to a swift and easy to explain game that isn't simple. Victory point mechanism is novel, action point 'time' system is well placed and both are effective. Some of the bits are slightly oversized for the board and the money tracks are just plain brain dead (one track runs from 0 to 19 and the other runs in steps of 20).

A brilliant game that is also historical.

The best game about mining. The best game about Cornwall. The best game about pasties!  And it has trains.

Bought #63 Treefrog edition from Martin Wallace at UK Games Expo 2008.

The time point mechanism is excellent.  The external investments is a nice touch with a further layer of tactical opportunities.  And the historical random ore price changes is good - it stops players having advance knowledge of history!  The designer notes are very illuminating.

The shortage of water cubes is easily solved by using 5 or 6 larger blue tokens (from another game) as size 4 or 5 water cubes.  I like to use pumps from McMulti in place of the Steam Pump discs.

It would have been nice if Shillings was the currency unit.  This would have been a good fit for the Money track (20 shillings to the £1), but perhaps a bit too confusing for the average gamer not familiar with pre-decimal British currency.

RATING: 5
A simple economic game, Your money is primarily used during in an auction to buy prime properties in Cornwall, and to mine (collect 2 resources (Tin & Copper) for sale on simple market. At the end you can trade money for VP's

Water cubes are used as the cost factor for you to mine your items. 

The other dimension is action points - to get items to reduce your cost to mine requires actions - these allow you to mine more cubes at time or remove water costs. The market is simplistic and with only 2 commodities does not balance out.

A strong timing component to get the good helpful items (ships, pumps, workers and trains), and to optimize your purchase of victory points.

While there are good points to the game, it is more abstract than Brass and not as interesting of a game. 

Personally I much prefer Wallace's historical games and Age of Steam.

Este é um dos jogos que conheço com maior ligação ao tema. O jogador sente-se na pele de um empresário da extracção mineira e tem de realizar um variado leque de acções para ser o mais bem sucedido no final do jogo, entre elas, comprar minas, investir nelas, extrair minério, fazer bolinhos, vender minério. É o primeiro jogo que joguei de Martin Wallace e, realmente, se os jogos dele forem todos assim, não admira que tenha tantos adeptos das suas obras, pois todo o jogo é um encanto, mesmo tendo um considerável factor sorte.

I wasn't particularly looking forward to a Wallace economic game when this I was persuaded to play this at my local club one night in 2012 (still my only play) - but it was a lot more fun than I was expecting, and I'd be happy to play again (although wouldn't want to play often). Some interesting mechanisms, creating some difficult decisions - and with dice to liven things up. I didn't see anything outstanding, so this is still just a 6, but it's not impossible that this could rise to a 7 if I got to play it more. (Definitely no more than that - it's still unexciting, something it shares with all of Wallace's games.)

Fiddly economic game that uses a ton of components to represent ore to mine and the different actions used to make your production more efficient. A fun game, but I do think the scoring is a little odd.

Very interesting game.  I like the tension of trying to get the mines as clear as possible.  Some of the people I play dislike the auction track as to random I didn't have a problem with it in the one game I played but I can see where it could burn you.

RATING: 6
So light but with so much theme it's a filler dressed up as a serious game about copper and tin mining. For all the dice rolling it's a rather good short game, but one that suffers from extreme randomness and poor scaling from four to three players. Easy to pick up it's a decent hour long game to dive into without much rules revision required.

Players elect to bid for placing mines in regions with known tin and copper reserves, or undiscovered regions. Once acquired they deploy a number of methods of draining the water from the mines to mine tin and copper for lower costs. It's all about the water and the money, but along the way you have to use your time effectively too. Money will buy you double as many points at the end of the first round as at the end of the fourth round, so players are challenged to score points early and not hold back to build a mining engine. I didn't find any tension in the VP track - an idea that could be good, but just doesn't pull it off.

Like I said, a theme that makes sense, but simplified and presented as an hour long game. Good for what it's trying to be.

I really enjoyed this, but I didn't like the fact that the winner was determined before even having to play the 4th round.  This was only from a first play, but I otherwise enjoyed it very much.

Now that I have played it a couple more times, this one goes further up in my book.  It plays quickly and the sense of reward for good planning is very refreshing.  Over-buying can be the death knell, though, so be careful.  Excellent game and one that I highly recommend!

Tinner's is now my #1 game, deposing Macao.  I love this game and I learn something new about it every time.

Dropped it down to #2. My one issue is that the points grid doesn't seem to have enough conflict for points.

This isn't a top 10 game for me anymore, but it's still REALLY fun and held up well three years in between plays.  My only gripe is still the lack of tightness on the pts table.

Tinner's Trail -- Played once; three-player.

Excellent game.  I just don't know how often we would actually play it.  If we had unlimited space, it would be in our collection.

Scott Nicholson: "The length was appropriate for the game, and the decisions were interesting. Each turn, you had a "cash it in now or hope for better" press-your-luck element to think about. The Time mechanism (similar to the one used in Thebes) is appropriate here, as you can either do big things and then wait around or do many small things. Great game, and I'm glad to hear there's a reprint coming."

More thematic than I'm used for an euro. And it's about industry. Gosh. The theme makes sense throughout and might even be stronger than interaction. The main pleasure for me was visual representation of a mining in a region and the deterioration of the area that comes with development - the map reminded me of those old maps of industrial development I've seen in my socialist youth all the time. (We played 2nd edition, the map could be nicer, it's a bit tacky, otherwise works perfectly fine). As far the mechanics go - I've seen them before, so I mostly appreciate the story they tell. For serious gaming I still prefer Chicago Express or Power grid, bit this one is neat.

RATING: 7
Played once with 3P and once with 4P. Tinner's Trail is a fine entry-level economic game which hinges on the auctioning of mining sites. The valuation of sites depends on a few factors – the amount of ore and water being the most obvious, but the adjacency of the site to the sea and other owned sites matter as well. The game mostly follows a predictable rhythm every round, but the time track throws in some welcome variation.

The use of dice rolls to determine ore prices is a bit of a sticking point here. Poor rolls are just difficult to work with, [i]especially[/i] if they occur in the last round. However, the presence of largely unmitigated luck can be accepted (albeit with hesitation) as it gears players towards optimising the current round, and there is some comfort to be found in the gradually shrinking cost-to-VP ratio. 

That said, the one design quirk which truly bugs me is the scoring system. There are very limited opportunities for blocking investments, even in a 4P game, as the VP payout scales proportionately to the amount paid. Players' scores are also in plain sight, but it is difficult to see who is in the lead without having to stop every round to tally up the scores.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of my favourite games. Long enough to be involving without overwhelming, it's got some player interaction in the auctions, some strategising over investment and potential for canny play because of the time-track mechanic. Looks lovely (though I hear the first edition didn't). I don't understand the complaint about first-player being too powerful, for me that fact influences your strategy rather than undoing it.

[1 play] I loved this game. While I could think of a few minor improvements that would connect the market mechanism to in-game factors, the true randomness of the market actually led to some real tension in the final turn between Corey and I. For some, there might be too much randomness in some of those die rolls, but it worked fine for me overall. In terms of the depth of strategy available and the fun vs time factor, this was a big winner for me. Wood components are nice, board art could be better, and money track could definitely be better. Those deficiencies don't really matter because this game is great. Can't wait to play it again.

Most recent play 9/21/11 with Donovan, Michael, and Corey.

Kellemes Wallace játék. A játékosok bányákat húznak fel, amivel kétfajta ércet bányászhatnak. Érdekes megoldás a víz bevezetése, amivel egyre drágább a bányászás. Érdekes az idő megjelenése is a játékban. Akcióinkat idő használatával tudjuk végrehajtani, mindig az jön, aki a legkevesebb időt használta fel. A bányászást különböző segítő dolgok vásárolhatók szintén időért. A fix 4 körös játékban minden kör végén az addig gyűjtött pénzünket győzelmi pontra válthatjuk egy táblázat segítségével, ahol konfliktus is kialakulhat, de ez igazából csak 4 játékos estén lehet érdekes. Kellemes játék a Tinners Trail, nem túl hosszú, de vannak mélységei. Valószínűleg 4 játékosnál jön ki a játék minden szépsége.

Sajnos már több mint egy éve volt az első parti így nem emlékszem milyen volt hárman, de négyen tényleg jól működött. Teljesen más stratégiák vezethetnek a siker felé. A szerencse szerepe viszont több helyen bejön a játékba, nem is kis mértékben sajnos. Egyrészt ugye a kockadobásokkal felkerülő új bányák esetén, másrészt az árucikkek áránál. Ezen simán eldőlhet egy parti. érdekessége a játéknak, hogy az egyes fordulók egyre rövidülnek időben általában a játék előrehaladtával. 7->6

Wowee!  What a neat little economic game.  Classic Wallace action selection, with some fun twists.  While this was intended to be a lighter game than the usual Warfrog fair, I think what we have is something merely less complicated and easier to explain with a shorter playing time.  

Still, I've got to say, I think this is still a gamer's game.  A less demanding gamer's game, but one that has a lot of meat on the bones, and one that I don't think would reveal itself to participatory gamers.  That's not to knock people that will only play games when asked, but there are a number of wonderful ways to manipulate the system cruelly that I don't think that the average "sure-I'll-try-one-of-[i]your[/i]-games" player is going to pick up on.  

As usual in a finely tuned Wallace game, there are a ton of tough little decisions.  This game is a bit more demanding action to action as there aren't that many actions you can take, the market is completely unreliable and the wonderfully implemented and admittedly borrowed time/action system creates the kind of turn angst that you expect from the man.  	

WARNING NITPICKING AHEAD: That said there are some minor issues there is certainly the potential to run into too few water cubes to keep the game moving as it should (I added 10 of my own with no issues).  A truly minor quibble is that the Blue player's VP cubes are confusing compared to the water cubes and being that one is intended to be limited, if you grab from the wrong pile, then you have to figure out what happened.   Again, an absurdly minor complaint is regarding the verkakte base 20 banking system.  WTF?  They should have just had 20 shillings in a pound, at least it would have made more thematic sense.

All of the SERIOUSLY insignificant quibbles aside, this is a fine little system, and it bodes very well for the Treefrog line.  I suspect that I will bump my rating to a 9 with more plays.

Does a great job of simulating water entering the mines.  Love the auction mechanic here and the time track interaction.  The game loses its interesting decisions at a couple of points, where your choices are forced or obvious, but for the most part, I find it compelling and challenging.  One downside is that there are far too few water cubes, and I think the fact that the game can drag a bit prevents it from moving into the upper echelon, although further play may raise its rating.

UPDATE: I think that overall you have an interesting game of chicken that you have to play with your opponents each round for deciding how you will set up turn order the next round. Also, I have no idea why I complained about the water cubes; they generally seem to be plentiful enough.

Good economic game from Martin Wallace. It feels as if Wallace built the game around its theme, rather than the other way around. The result is a game that's enjoyable all the way through. The turn order and mining mechanics are brilliant. The VP conversion phase may be too much hassle for what it is, but it's not so much a problem as an annoyance, and only that because the game itself is so interesting.

RATING: 7.5
A very good economic game about mining copper and tin, selling it, and investing for the future (VP). Turn order manipulation (passing early to get priority the following turn) is very important since the really good actions (adit, steam pumps, etc.) are in limited supply. There is some randomness but I think it's relatively manageable and it should reward the prepared player (or, the very lucky player!). If nothing else, the game plays quickly enough that I don't mind the randomness (and the chaotic ore market even fits the theme, which is nice!). 

The one part of the game I don't like as much as the rest is the VP table: in 3er games, at least, there doesn't seem to be much competition for specific VP spots on the table so the system seems overly convoluted. It also seems as if it would have been better to change the money:VP ratio at each money increment so that VP purchases were more meaningful (or, simply buy at a fixed ratio each turn).

--- Investment Phase Variant ---
Each turn, add a number of water cubes to the investment table based on the new prices of Copper and Tin. Place one water cube per line starting from the highest (50£) on the column of the current turn.

Interesting economic system with some clever ideas, such as the water representing the cost of mining and increasing over time, the balance of cash on hand vs. buying points, the descending victory points, passing early to have a more favorable start position, the fluctuating commodity prices, and having two new mines each round.  My main issue was the game end was quite anti-climactic, with most moves predetermined and half of us just taking pasties.  It will be interesting to see if that was an aberration or not.  Update:  the last round was more competitive this time and the scores were very close, but I just didn't find myself enjoying it all that much and I actually won the game.  Maybe it moves just a bit too slowly.  One of those that I won't turn down but wouldn't request either.

It didn't grab me that much. I've found it maybe too much easy for players who don't take risks but this is not a final opinion. I have to play it again to see if I like it better the next time.
It's challenging and the mechanics (once more) are clever. It could be a good game to introduce people into boardgames.

Played with 3 players. It's not very different although I think it's better with 4. Still have the same opinion: the game rewards players that don't take risks and I'm not sure I like that in a Wallace game!

After playing this game a few more times I really don't like it very much. It has something that i don't like and I'm not aware of what it is. It could be the randomness in some aspects of the game that destroys strategies when the game seems to be strategical or it could even be the lack of patience for the repetitive decisions. It only takes four turns which is good. It could be played in the 60 minutes range but it constantly drags a bit more in my group I'm not sure why. 
The dependence on some dice results really really bugs me enough for not having much fun playing it. Plus, after enough plays I still don't get the VP chart. I really don't! 
It is one of the most beautiful games I own. The board is absolutely gorgeous and the front cover (Treefrog Edition) is amazing!

Second Third play and it felt a little processional, with the first round auctions so crucial that in both games 2 and 3 decided the outcome.

Ok this is billed as lighter fare but, the rhythem of mine+improvement could have been broken up

I am having a hard time coming up with an opinion on this one.   The randomness of the market is overwhelming.  In my one play it fluctuated wildly.  In the first turn the prices were high and one of the players bought a good amount of stock, while the other two players saved their cash for later.  Then in turn two market tanked to the point where it wasn't even worth pulling any ore out of the ground.  This made for a strange turn but more importantly it created a situation where the first turn stock purchase was wildly more valuable.   Yes, you can hedge against such fluctuations by doing exactly what one of the players did by buying stock.  Maybe that is the lesson I need to learn.  And I think that this game may have been an outlier, and it deserves more play, but it seems that the market fluctuation determined the winner not the savvy moves made by the players.

A good game for three; haven't tried four yet.

But the calculations are very different.  I liked the idea that we were mining tin and copper while fending off the floods.

RATING: 7
[Warfrog first print edition (#424)] {Industry, economic; auction, variable-player-order, action-point; optimal 4p}  TT is fun and interactive.  Martin intended to make it a lighter-weight game but it's still a gamers' game.  Players can have many tactical options and good planning.  IN addition, it is more thematic than other Martin's games.  I like it very much.

The cash flow is tight in this game.  Since there are only 4 rounds, good planning is mandatory.  Otherwise, one will surely lose.  Maintain a good flow of resource cubes is also important to avoid nothing to mine in later rounds.  Martin intentionally adds more randomness to the game with dice rolls but the game is not random at all.  Players only need to take risk in building a new mine in empty region. 

The game components are not effective enough.  A money track is created because TreeFrog will not have paper money / cards but it's quite clumsy to mark money that way.  Another problem is WHY they choose a blue player color while water cubes are also in blue! The board is very informative; it's good.

More Wallace historical economics. Somewhat lighter & quicker than Brass, but still reasonably hefty. Interesting turn order & timing considerations: after just two plays, I particularly like the time point squeeze near the end of the available actions - when to pass and claim first turn for the next round, and when to choose to auction a mine in the hope of getting it cheap because other players won't want to spend two of their remaining time points.

Each game seems to play out very differently due to initial board setups and copper/tin pricing.

Geek buddies 7.64:  comments dubious. Mention of big market swings of the dice.  desire bumped down to play.  **UPDATE**  So close but ultimately fails because of the market.  I love the mining, the time track, the available developments, the two resources, the water.  I can tollerate the VP buying, but the random dice market kills it for me.  I can see why there needs to be some unknown aspect to the mining operation but I don't like the market as is.  I could see making some sort of house rule or market variant, but I'd rather play other games than try to fix this one.

RATING: 7
Tight action selection game with a set number of turns. How efficient can you be given the puzzle of the opening set up? The setting is mining for copper and tin but your efforts are hampered by pesky water that keeps filling up your mines. Each action costs time, and position on the time track determines player order. If you are careful with your actions and have an inkling on what your opponents need to do, you can make the time track work in your favor and take more actions. Only one action really affects other players, which is bidding for the right to place a mine in a certain spot. There are several other actions that help improve mining efficiency, water removal. The market price of copper/tin varies round to round affecting your decision on where and what to mine. At the end of each round, the players make investments which is money for victory points. There is zero hidden information. Elegant game.

21-Oct-10: So, got my ass kicked in Tinner's Trail but still had a great time :-) I'm beginning to think that Tinners Trail > Power Grid, in terms of both of them being almost the same kind of game. Both have initial auctions. Both require some sort of region control. The shorter play time is why i think Tinners T is better than Power G. But I fail to understand why Martin Wallace didn't include rules to allow 2p-6p. I mean, it's just a matter of reducing regions available for less players (like Power G), and increases resources/developments (like Power G). 5-6p Tinner's Trail should be quite interesting.

Hm. Well, as I've said before for other games of his, very Martin Wallace-y. His common practices aren't bad, but maybe it would be nice if he branched out? But maybe terrifying! (Martin: :>; others :/.) In any case, TT has the usual tight-money, battle-for-VPs dynamic of many MW games. Since each turn is divided into 10 "action points" (perhaps not the official term, but much-like except with Thebes-like phasing(1), perhaps the four turns are a bit misleading, much as if one describing Ra as having 3 turns (eras). Naturally, it has player order set randomly, then by giving up actions(2).

Okay: Prolix and rather of the point of whether I liked TT. I did rather like TT, though I'm not sure the liking would survive repeated exposure. I definitely screwed up playing it by not getting that prices for tin and copper are set only four times; and the game is (unusually!) front-weighted! The first turn is likely to give somewhat better prices (and the last, worse), plus the best spaced tend to be available first turn. I saw it; realized it; and didn't act on it--my bad, not MW's.

I can't say I'm entranced by TT (as with Glen More or Hansa Teutonica) or even generally like it (as with Brass). My *impression* is that only four turns puts far too much chance into the game. I think I would have preferred a 40 action point game with only sales at the four 10-action spots--but it's easy to second-guess after only one play.

(1--The active player takes an action then moves his time marker to reflect how long the action took. First player to reach a time point goes first after all previous time points are cleared.)

(2--You can give up further actions in a "turn" [game phase] to take the first [second...] spot at the start of the next "turn". Or you can earn £1 per action. I don't think I properly valued going first--or almost anything--in my first game.)

It's an OK economic game about mining with some dice rolling.  The market price swings can make or break someone's plan.  Perhaps more kinds of resources can alleviate the problems of big swings.

I like this quite a bit. I haven't seen the orginal, but the JKLM reprint has nice art and components. Players have plenty of option and face difficult decisions, and best of all, the game plays very quickly despite having some real depth. The only drawback, to my mind, is the end game, when there aren't enough spaces for everyone to spend all their money of victory points. I know this limitation is supposed to be a feature, but it bugs me that victory in the game can come down to a couple of players colluding to shut out another player. Another quibble is that this "feature" typically doesn't kick in until the last turn, and then only if prices are high. It's a very random element that I could do without. Still, it's a small quibble with an otherwise excellent game. I think a simple "fix" would be to simply let people spend all their money on victory points with no restrictions.

The flooding of mines with each visit is a stroke of genius and the Thebes-style time track is similarly delicious.  Those mechanisms aside, Tinner's Trail is a surprisingly straightforward title with almost no difficult decisions other than auction valuations.  It feels almost like a kid's game:  big, colorful, and once it's set up it kind of runs itself.  Gamers who bite into the pricing models will find enough to keep them satisfied.

RATING: 6
I had higher expectations for the next game up so was even more disappointed when it fell short. Tinners’ Trail was the first game in Wallace’s Treefrog line, of which I’ve now tried 5 out of 8 games and find Wensleydale  to easily be the reigning Treefrog champ. Tinners’ Trail was simpler than most Wallace games certainly with fairly straightforward mechanics for winning control of regions in auction, upgrading those regions with various improvements to make them more efficient or productive, spending money to mine cubes from those regions, selling those cubes for more money, and finally spending money to purchase victory points. There did not appear to be much subtlety to the rinse and repeat process of this cycle. The general idea of the game was appealing, but I took issue with two specific points. First, the rolling of dice to determine the contents and value of a region after it is auctioned. Why not roll the dice before the auction? One player in our game was completely eliminated because all of his auctions resulted in poor rolling and worthless territories. The regions should at least have some minimum value like the starting regions. Second, the rolling of dice to determine the resale value of the cubes. Why not come up with something a little more predictable and stable? Perhaps the white cubes could slowly decrease in value and the orange cubes could slowly increase in value, each moving one step on the value track each turn in opposite directions. Anything but the current method would seem preferable, in which players who happen to be mining one color cubes can randomly and significantly benefit over players who happen to be mining the other color cubes just because of one die roll. I have no problem with dice in many contexts  (e.g., Queen’s Gambit, Descent, Byzantium, Age of Steam, Die Macher), but in Tinners’ Trail they felt like a lazy solution to the problem of determining region and resource values.

Played 3 play with straight rules; might be better fit four player or adjusted resources for 3-player.

Simple rules, intuitive game play, very nice components (if you like cubes, this is a game for you). You will play it again and again. There are some very interesting choices to be made and everything becomes apparent after you play the game a couple of times. Although you will enjoy the game from the first play!
It has a theme similar to Brass, but these two games are very different. Brass is a masterpiece of rules and complexity that you will enjoy playing with other "heavy" euro gamers. Tinner is the mining game that you will enjoy with friends that have a variety of gaming tastes.

RATING: 7.5
About [thing=35570][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=35570][/thing] is a tight economic game, in which players bid for areas to mine copper and tin, develop them with adits, ports, trains and such, trying to lower the cost of mining (by removing water) while, at the same time, making the extraction better, allowing them to take more for less, thus being able to sell at a higher profit. All of this is done in order to invest in industries outside of Cornwall, as these is where the actual victory points come from.

Everything is neatly woven together with a time system: all actions take time to be done, but some more than others - which means a player behind on time is able to make two or more actions in a row, until her time meets that of the others.

[thing=35570][/thing] is a perfect exemple of a mid-weight Martin Wallace ecomomic game: clean, smart, with a good pacing, tough choices and with a nice amount of player interaction.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
After the set up is done, each player, in time order picks an action to do. All actions cost time, and acquiring a mining area and mining itself also cost money.

The game lasts for 4 rounds and in each round each player has 10 time to spend. Some actions are limited: only two ports can be build in each round; only one adit per round; only one drain action per round; and such. There are no limits of the amount of auctions for areas and mining the players can do, except for the limit of time each round has.

Mining costs, for each resource taken, $1 per water the area has. For instance, if you mine an area with 3 water cubes and take three resources - two coppers and one tin - you would need to pay $9. 

Players mine copper and tin in order to sell then, at the end of the round, in order to gain money and use it to invest in industries outside of Cornwall - the sooner and the more money spent, the better it is.

When a player starts a bid for an area, all players can participate, regardless of what time they are at (but they must have at least two time to spend, as this is the cost in time to purchase one mining area).

If the player is out of options (because she is out of money and all the limited actions have already been done), she can sell pasties, and get $1, or pass, and likely be able to prospect a new mining area and start her actions sooner in the next round.

Once the 4 rounds are done, the player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
There are several. During the round it will be: which action to do. This must take into consideration four things:
a) the state of the board - which mines the others and you have; what are the selling prices for tin and copper in the round; which areas for mining are still up for grab and what are their position in relation with the others you have and your opponents have; and so on;
b) which limited actions are still available, as these are likely to be done first, usually before auctions and mining, and it isn't smart to let the others do them and be left without;
c) how much money the others and you have;
d) how much time the others and you still have and need.

The actions, on themselves, are pretty easy to be done - but choosing them have several connections and lasting effects, that goes into the other rounds.

Once the actions are done, selling is mandatory. However, how to spend the money is up to the players. Investing outside Cornwall can be tricky: not only one must consider how much to spend (and how much to save for the next round, considering possible auctions and costs for mining), but also in which spots to put their money - as each spots can only have two cubes, therefore is possible, for players, to lock someone out of a place, which can mean that this person will either need to spend an amount that she didn't want (be either too much or too few) or, worst, be unable to invest further.

Though the decisions aren't complicated to understand, most of them carry a lot of weight and direct affect the others, be by taking the last of a limited action, by taking an mining area once no one else could enter in the dispute, and so on.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Few rules with a good amount of depth;
- Nice level of interaction, most of it being good (sometimes is hard not to help someone else) instead of destructive;
- The economic system is simple and, yet, is provides a fine level of opportunity and risk-taking for the players;
- Downtime is usually small;
- Decisions matter a lot and several have lasting effects.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- No catch up mechanism, and there is little chance to recover ground, except by mistake of others;
- The rounds start tense and intense, with great dispute of actions, but once they are gone, and they are gone rather quickly, the second half of the rounds tend to be dull, with almost no interaction, except an occasional auction, as most players will simply be mining and selling pasties;
- The overall look is rather unappealing.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like the aliens from Signs: water is your worst enemy; or like the people on Waterworld, you will want to find Dry land. Most of your decisions will revolve around water: buy and mine where there is less of it; use ports, trains, adits and drains to reduce the amount of water; save money because of water. Is like you are mining Gizmos.

Anyway, [thing=35570][/thing] is a game that also made me feel a bit like when playing [thing=39351][/thing]: the same four rounds, few actions and a great need to prioritize, pretty tight, but with less competition and more control. Overall, the pacing for [thing=39351][/thing] was better to me, as it was lively throughout the whole round, while in [thing=35570][/thing] things started heated and dwindled as the round went on. Still, [thing=35570][/thing] has the same vein of quality, and is a game that rewards foward thinking, some daring decisions and puts players in a good enviroment to strategize and outfox their opponents. Recommended.

RATING: 8
Tinners' Trail has all of Wallace's thematic seamlessness & player entanglement, but is accessible to non-gamers without condescension.

- Smooth - smoother than London in it's way, the game is quick & even transitioning from something like an auction into actions that fill the map, the hand motions & the thinking & the way the map develops just goes s-m-o-o-t-h. You can see everything unfold & make choices, yet it has a just so complexity that doesn't break brains but gives you constant gamestates to gauge & adapt to.

- Love the look of the game. These big beautiful wooden boats, trains, mines, etc crowd onto the map, and they're dramatic in their crowded color splash... like big things are happening, but the irony being...

- ...these big wooden things on the board represent small nudges to mine capacity or water costs (the pain currency), and these iterations of little pushes (the difference between a 1 and a 2 in a game element) ripple through the development choices & the mining & the market & then VPs in such an interesting way. 

- The time cost of things is wonderful. Right there on the board you can see & evaluate tempo costs. Usually this sort of thing is a result of managing the synergy of elements, tempo can be a struggle to sense & then see & then, hopefully, control. Here it's right on the board. Wow, very cool.

- With what I worried (in a short game) would be samey-ness in player arcs, instead differentiates. The auction, the time cost choices, the changes in turn order not just for the round, but with each action (it's not unusual to take multiple turns in a row, or to forego this to your opponent to grab an opportune mining development), the VP buyout, differing mining developments with different effects & time costs, the map itself & positioning. All these choices are sweet & quick & keep everyone involved & embedded in different overarching tempos of development & mining. And you can see these ripples really clearly, see what each other is doing. 

- Now when I say this, I don't mean the way some games have a much larger game space for quite severe differences in journeys through the game... I mean given it's few & crowded-together elements I was pleased with the relative differentiation.

- The VP buyout at the end of each round is brilliant. It happens in quick turn order rounds, as each decides how much cash to invest in VPs (they're cheaper early in the game) and how much to carry over to manage mining operations the next round. This is done in multiple steps too, adding to the psychology of feints & second guessing.

- I really like that the players don't manage the market price for the ores; each round special die & modifiers create an uncontrolled market that each player needs to react to. This game isn't about controlling the market, it's about reacting to it with preparedness & choices.

- The auctions players initiate to place mines & thus claim a space on the map isn't overwrought, establishing both value & denial tactics is seeable & smooth. You can have more cash & bid someone up just to make sure they pay a price, and they can pull out & leave you with a time cost that ruins your multiple mining plans in a good market (for example). So the pieces in the auction are seeable, but the psychological space is terrific & joins with the rest of the game phases really well.

- This isn't an AP or churning game.

-The randomized setup & prospecting mechanic is well made, controlled within norms by special die so there are better properties to mine, but no wild swings, and adjacencies factor in to planning your board presence & development. The process feels nicely balanced, and the map is easy to read for choices, helping the speed of the game.

I liked this and how many games are there about Cornwall!  I look forward to playing this in a St Ives Pub, or the Tinner's Arms at Zennor.  

Interestingly, it wasn't on sale at the Geevor mine museum.

Anyhows, the game plays well, although the random (ish) price setting on ore makes it a gamble as to what you choose to mine.  Appropriate for the topic (the price of tin fell tenfold overnight in the early 1990's!), but can feel a little unbalanced.

Nice auction based game though

Interesting, but there isn't enough tension in the action system. Thebes' similar system works well because delaying a dig might allow the card you really need to come up, and because the players are competing with each other for the the cards and the digs. Here you know in advance exactly what is available, and you are only competing for improvement actions. (The ore pricing is also too random for my taste, but that can be tweaked easily enough.)

Played three times with three players, and already this game is one of my all-time favorites! The theme suits the gameplay perfectly, and is very compelling. Components are of great quality, and the manual is easy to read (and does not raise any questions as with most of the Warfrog games). Finally, the game is filled with suspense until the very end and I feel that a sound strategy (and a good estimation of the required cash flow for your next turn) is definitely rewarded. Only drawback is that it only plays with three or four players.
UPDATE: After a couple more plays, the game has lost a little bit of its appeal for me. The main reason for this, is that success is largely determined by guessing correctly if prices are going up or down next turn. It is hard to catch up with a player who is able to mine the most copper at the most favorable price. Considering that prices are determined by rolling the dice each turn, this makes for a considerable luck factor. Still like the game a lot, but lowered the rating to a more fitting 7.5.

then players can mine, the cost of mining is determined by number of water cubes. doing the mine puts one water cube in.

Classic Wallace. Tight economic game where you have to very carefully balance converting money to victory points against building up for future turns. Definitely don't have all the nuances down yet (also, as with any bidding game, knowing what things are worth takes some time). Could play quite quickly with people who know what they are doing, which is nice.

Martin Wallace's take on the time based action system found in Neuland and Thebes. Basically a game about investing time + money into getting resources, which you turn around and sell for more money. Then at the end of each round you decide how much money to turn into VP and how much to carry over to the next round. The catch is that the conversion rates from money to VP get worse each round, so you must decide just how much money you think you'll actually NEED next round, since anything beyond that you'd like to convert. This decision isn't always obvious though cause there are occasionally auctions. Beyond that, the game is outfitted with all the typical Martin Wallace idiosyncrasies, which is a bit annoying cause this could have potential as a gateway economic game if it were more streamlined/polished. In particular, the whole placing cubes on spaces in order to convert cash to VP at the end of each turn is overwrought and unnecessary. All in all, I'm curious to play this a couple more times, but I don't really see it having a lifespan of more than a few plays.

RATING: 5
It's been a while since I've come across a Wallace game that I didn't like, but Tinners' Trail is it.  There are a lot of good things going for the game -- the placements are interesting, as do the adits and the time track in respect to the auctions -- but the random dice rolling for the market can be wildly unpredictable.  I get that it keeps the game different each game, and that it represents the gamble that miners make in the market of the resources, but when you roll nothing but water for a particular region, it gets a little frustrating.  Then, when you make that same horrible roll for multiple regions, then suddenly the game is wound up too tightly.  I'll play it again, to make sure I didn't miss anything, but I wasn't impressed with my first go-round.

Estremamente lineare e pulito, poche regole che filano liscie come l'olio per un gioco a mio avviso tra i migliori del buon Wallace. Ottimo.

This is another great "gamer's game" follow-up to Brass, though not as deep and unforgiving.  I like the auction mechanism in this one.  Another winner by Martin Wallace.

Yet another "OK, but I won't cry if I never play this again" type of game. I love the turn other mechanism though, it creates very interesting dynamics. Unfortunately there's something wrong about the victory point table, the numbers in a given column shouldn't simply add up, the price-to-value ratio of the highest rows should be tweaked.

There are some neat ideas here and there, but I would pick Power Grid or Brass over Tinners' Trail any day.

A pity the ore prices are set by dices, this ruined a bit our third round.

Excellent game.  All the info you need is on the board. Good production qualities and theme works well. Each game is going to be very different with the ore price and water variables. Plenty of decisions to make while fingers crossed the 'miner' will still be available by the time it is your turn again. Turn order decider is added bonus and dynamic to game.

Light game?  Who says this is a light game?  It may be easy to learn and may include some random factors, but there is plenty to think about and chew on in this one.

this is one of those game that would be quite good but have one single problem that ruins everything. The price of materials to be sold is too important to be left to chance. The strategy comes out completely shattered if the dice dont help you. Mechanics themselves are good, rules are simple enough (but not elegant, expecially when describing the behaviour of the prices of the materials). Good enough components.
I would say this could have been a very good game.

I really like the weight of this Wallace game. I also enjoy the way he builds a game around a story or theme. cracker.

RATING: 6
After four plays, I feel like I've fully digested the game and don't need to play again.  The strategy  - and there is only one, I think - is a "more money, more points" rodeo, where going earlier in player order (based on deciding when to pass) is critically important in grabbing victory points and special actions.

Among players of equal experience, I imagine that die rolls and point lock-outs are overemphasized to the point of annoyance.  I don't like being annoyed while playing games.

Glad I played it, glad I didn't buy it.

Interesting game. Each time you dig for ore at a mine, you add a water cube. The more water that you have to deal with increases the cost of mining. This is a good mechanic to simulate a real world situation. A challenging economic game.

Fairly straight-forward to play, considering it's a Martin Wallace game. By that I mean there are very few exceptions or easily forgotten rules. Optimising your mining operation and investing for victory points are the difficult parts, with some tricky decisions to make. It has a well-integrated, original theme. The random market prices and cube distribution may dismay the overly analytical player, but the dice add a bit of variety which either affects everyone or can be played around.

I am fond of worker placement games, and this one had lots of thematic decisions & actions. The wooden pieces did seem a bit oversized compared to the cubes, mind you, but that's a minor niggle.

RATING: 8
Solid design. Fun, a little random so it can be hard to plan ahead. I want to play more. I think the rating could rise.

I think I like this enough to go up to an 8. We will see if it stays there.

on the one hand i was pretty impressed upon reading the rules, and looked forward very much to playing.  seemed like it had a good assortment of mechanics, and interesting game play options.  i have a particular fondness for action point / time based games and this implements that pretty well.  however, the resources in the game are entirely random, and this can be very disappointing.  you could tell that Wallace knew it too, since he has fiddely bonuses to the resource die rolls at the beginning and certain other points.  they aren't enough.  in our game, the copper resource never went above the second lowest value, and the tin stayed between medium value, and semi-high.  this had a curious and stilted effect of bringing the game to a near standstill.  good thing it's only four turns.  also, the victory points are almost meaningless and very gamey.  there's no difference between buying the very expensive VPs, and buying a couple less expensive.  maybe with some tweaks this could be a very good game.  but it ain't there.

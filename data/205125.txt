Fun and easy to teach. A much simplified version of TtR for the kids. Was fun for the adults and my son (4 y/o), and my son won his first game.

RATING: 5
Despite being billed as a kids version of Ticket to Ride (a game I very much like), the game only removes in game scoring (and so the need to add numbers?) and shrinks the board. Else, this is identical to Ticket to Ride. As a result, I don't think it works as a kids game or if it does, so does the regular Ticket to Ride: completing tickets is the end game condition, but the complexity of routing from one city to the next is too complicated for younger kids - i.e. if they can figure that out, they probably can add too - so why not let them play the regular (and much better) game?

While the randomness of this game is cranked up high in order to simplify it for little kids, it does a great job of teaching kids the concept of hidden objectives that are personal instead of each player having the same goal.

RATING: 7
It's more luck-based than 'grown up' Ticket to Ride, plays faster, and takes out the point calculation. In other words, it's exactly what it is meant to be, Ticket to Ride Jr. The production is nice, and it does teach you the groundwork for the other games in the series, but it does some of that decision making in the original. Bought for my son when he's older.

This game is only slightly modified from the original and can be played with some of the missing rules without problems.  The map has nice symbols for the kids and the scoring cards are all worth 1 point.  The pieces are not of the same quality as the original and you need to watch your kids with the cards as they crease easily.  Very good game for ages 5+ until they are ready for the real versions.

Great version to get kids into Ticket To Ride. My 7 & 10yr old really enjoy this. Game will appeal more to existing players and I feel the rule sheet is a bit too light if you are new to the game.

This is a keeper and will also be used as a filler once kids move onto normal Ticket To Ride. I can see this work as a possible gateway game.

This is Locke's (5) favourite new game, overtaking Flea Circus!  He is constantly asking for this and does a great job of keeping up with everyone else.  He is yet to win, but he is close every time.  We just need to show him the most efficient way to get to his tickets, especially when he receives new tickets. He gets stuck on finishing them in the order he receives them.  Adults are happy to play this with him, as we can enjoy the tactics that are still apparent. We may add in TTR rules about having a row of cards to pick from.

This is a nice simplified version for younger kids. The map is similar to the regular TtR, but much simplified with fewer spaces for the routes, and fewer cities. To aid the kids, each city is a large unique picture. The tickets prominently show these logos in the correct space like the original game. The simplified victory rules makes things easier--and they also make setting game time easy--adjust the number of completed tickets to accommodate shorter attention spans. For what the game is intended to be, it’s good.

2017 acquisition.

This is a nice game for the little ones (who have already played a few of the designer games) and gives the feel of the normal Ticket to Ride but with less complexity for the children.  It is not just a game for children but is also enjoyable for adults.

Out of the 3 children-version of the, I call them, big 3 classic beginner's Euros, ie. Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride, I would rate Ticket to Ride: First Journey number 1, followed by Catan Junior and then My First Carcassonne.

Highly recommended.

Le système de scoring a été logiquement simplifié par rapport à la version pour adultes. Par contre, il n'y a plus de cartes visibles, on ne peut que piocher, ce qui rend le jeu plus hasardeux.

A good distillation of TtR.  Much simpler and more luck-dependent than its big brother, but it captures the same feel.  My 7 year old had more fun playing this than the regular game.  I found it frustrating to blind draw train cards for many turns and still not get the correct colors required for a route.  I may try a display of train cards like in the grown up version.   Of the trio of kids' versions of most recommended gateway games (Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, and Catan), I had the most fun playing this one.

When I first heard talk of this game, I didn't understand why we needed a junior version of Ticket to Ride, as it's a simple enough game to teach kids as it is. However, upon getting a chance to play this game, I was struck by how kid friendly it had been made without sacrificing the fun of the game.

First change is that it's text independent, so kids aren't required to know how to read in order to play, every location is represented by a signature image as well as being named, and this is clearly represented on the tickets as well.

Second change is the simplicity of your turn. You generally choose between two simplified options. Draw two cards from the top of the deck (no choosing colours from a display) or claim a route. If this completes a ticket, you place it in front of you and draw a new ticket from the top of the deck.

Third is the removal of point and no penalty for not completed tickets. You are playing to be the first to complete six tickets or have the most tickets completed when a player places their last train. There are also no longest route bonus, but if you connect the east and west coast you win a coast-to-coast ticket, which counts towards your amount of tickets.

Lastly, you can get rid of tickets you cannot complete. You always have two tickets on your hand, but if you ever get so unlucky that you're blocked from being able to complete your tickets, you can use a turn to discard both of them and draw two new ones.

This is definitely a great child friendly introduction to Ticket to Ride, highly recommended.

Fast paced TTR to play with the kids - less options, faster route building, no points to count - I think they will outgrow this one pretty fast but for the time being an excellent choice for smaller kids - not enough options for my taste and I think the kids will grow out of this game too fast to keep it in the closet

[b]Ticket to Ride: First Journey[/b] was traded away in a math trade 1/16/17. (Received Kanagawa)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6 -> 4)[/COLOR]

[i]My thoughts from last year ended up ringing true as my daughter soon grew tired of TTR: First Journey and as a result we continued to play other games we had. My daughter recently turned 7 so I'm not really looking for new children's games, but if I were I wouldn't bother with a "kid's" version of an already published game. The only one we still own, and prefer over the original, is Zooloretto Junior. I don't think I'd recommend TTR: First Journey, there are too many excellent, original children's games available. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This is a great introduction to TTR for my 6 year old daughter and surprisingly was enjoyed by the rest of the family. My son thought it was a bit more cut throat with four players because it was easy to be blocked out of a city. The mechanics are basically the same with the big difference being that when you draw cards you take two from the top of the deck, there isn't a row of face up cards to choose from. This keeps the game moving at a nice clip. Other differences are that most tickets only go through at most two cities, there are six colors plus wild cards and you can spend a turn to discard the two tickets you have and draw new ones. Lastly each city has a picture to go with it, even on the ticket cards, so it is easy for non readers to find the cities they need to connect.

This version of TTR definitely streamlines the game for younger players, in fact for the first few games we only played with one ticket at a time instead of two so my daughter could get the hang of the game. I enjoy playing games with my daughter so I'll happily play this, but I more enjoy the children's games that we own which are original designs versus simplified versions of games already produced. That said this is one of the best children's version of of an established game that I've played.[/i]

Does a great job of stripping out a few things from TTR to make it suitable for a 6-year-old (it was our Christmas present to our nephew). The biggest change is that there are no VPs, it's just first to complete 6 tickets. Also the options on a turn are reduced - all draws are blind and you get a new ticket automatically when you complete one, so it's just 'draw 2 cards or build a route'.

RATING: 8
for adults:  6/10
for families:  8/10

This does an excellent job at removing parts of the game that are difficult for kids while keeping the parts that are the essence of the game.  There are no points, just a goal of finishing 6 tickets (which are well balanced).  There is no draft board, just random draws (and appropriately easy routes).  There are no gray routes -- just short colored routes.  My 6-year-old could play entirely on her own, and formulate strategies and practice thinking ahead.  Well done!

My only objection is that I think 6 year olds can handle a draft board (although perhaps that slows the game down too much or reduces the excitement of drawing wilds).  But that's easily fixed.

The game is still even fun for adults and not devoid of strategy.  It's on par with Trans-America in depth and speed.

What a great game for kids. Sure, you could probably teach your kids on the original version, but with the big chunky trains and great art, this really makes it fun for them. And it plays fast!  With 2-3 short connections between cities on tickets, this introduces basic Ticket to Ride strategy of overlapping paths more often than the original so the little ones can pick it up faster. A natural progression to the original for kids.

[8 for children; 6 for adults] [Day of Wonder 16 edition] {Train; set-collection; optimal 4p} I love ticket to ride.  That's why I got this game for my daughters.  It rocks! The components are gorgeous and colourful: children love this game!  There is nice player interaction, but not as cut-throat as the basic games; so, it's children friendly.

This is an excellent entry game for children to master strategy games.

There is no more card drafting, just by luck of draw but children quickly learnt to try their luck by swapping their tickets until they found tickets nearer their established routes.  They were happy when they can draw the cards they need!

Nicely recommend for children.

It only feels like a "kids" version compared to the original. Judged on its own merits, it's a great FAMILY game that I played with a table full of adults who all enjoyed it quite a bit.

It's very simple - my six-year old liked it, my eight-year old found it a bit boring. I kinda liked it as a family activity, but do not buy this and think it will work as an adult game. Recommended if you have kids who are interested in getting into board games.

I gave this to my 6-year old niece for Christmas 2016.  We found that the game has just enough for her to keep track of at her age (multiple routes and the train cards she has in her hands) without being too overwhelming.  We really think this is a good game to play with her friends, us, or her mother and grandmother for the next few years, before we introduce regular Ticket to Ride with scoring, longest route, ect.

House rules for 4 yr old: starting hand of 6 cards. After claiming route, draw # cards = # cards discarded to claim. Helps move the game along for short attention spans.

Excellent game for kids that is still fun for adults. It feels more luck dependent than the full versions of Ticket to Ride, and whilst I think it can be played by all ages, It wouldn't be a first choice if all the players were 12 or older

Despite my dislike of the regular games, this is a great children's game. So much better than the crap that's sold to children.

Very simple version of Ticket to Ride that is perfect for young children. My daughter looks forward to playing and understands the mechanics/rules fairly well. Great for families with young children.

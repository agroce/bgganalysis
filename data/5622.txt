I got this because Mark Herman only makes awesome games and because this one has a reputation that proceeds it.

Also, I want a really good operational-level WWII/PTO game.  I have Empire of the Sun for strategic level.

Update: I really wish I had discovered this game in the 1980s when I was young and had lots of time.  Having a tough time now because I can't figure out how to solo the game well and opponents that can play a game this detailed and long are hard to come by.  The game is all that.  I just wish I could play it.

I did enjoy this game. Many scenarios from the solo quickies to a whole mini campaign for Guadalcanel.  And the whole campaign, if you have nothing better to do for several months. Playing it with others I was very annoyed to find people putting Japanese carriers in front to take advantage of their better aircraft range!  Space constraints meant I was not able to play it for many years, and now I think I prefer to spend my life playing other games.

We played once a campaign game. Unfortunately I had to leave abroad for my studies and couldn't finish the game. But the game is phantastic and the rules include it all, from the night naval engagement to the experience of the pilots and the  kamikaze planes. My only regret is that the Soviet operation from 1945 isn't represented and the rules states that the Japanese player must remove some units and forces.

Rules were actually fairly simple to read. The game needs quite a few tables for set up and if you have cats -forget it. Very comprehensive game. Liked the concept of setting up HQ's and actually looking at logistics, strategic planning and supply in formulating one's plans and actions. Counters and maps still hold up 20 years later. One of the last great dinosaurs. I would like to try 'Asia Engulfed' for comparison.

Will wait for the reprint, if only to avoid using those dark blue US counters which I can barely read.

The rules look innovative, even in 2015, with an emphasis on the cat and mouse of detection and misinformation in the vast openness of the Pacific as well as a robust combat system.

Sold this awhile ago because it was just too big and complex and the counters were too ugly and generic looking. But I am thinking about it again now that there is a new edition under way that will have new counter art, especially now that I know Markus S. will be the developer.  Might still require too much table space to play however.

Undoubtedly the most innovative rules system that I've ever seen. Pacific War is an incredibly exciting and fluid game once you start pushing some carrier groups into each other. The system works very well at sea, while the land combat is bit clunkier.

I think the game gets often dismissed as a unplayably long monster game, but for me the main feature are the shorter scenarios that cover separate battles and operations. The campaign is just there as an optional thing if you want to do everything at the same time.

Los escenarios operacionales son magnificos. La niebla de guerra está muy bien conseguida; cuando inicias una operación desconoces totalmente con qué te va a responder el contrario y la localización de las flotas enemigas se convierte en la principal tarea.

Pensado para jugar sus escenarios, el juego realmente brilla, en su campaña. La forma como el tiempo se estira y encoge en las operaciones es una mecánica espectacular y única, y la incertidumbre que se crea en cada operación, sin saber si avanzas al desastre o la victoria decisiva, crea una clima de tensión, y de toma de decisiones único.

Thought to play his scenenarys, the game really shines, in his campaign game. The form the time stretches and shrinks in the operations is an spectacular and unique mechanic, and the uncertainty created in every operation, without knowing if you advance to the disaster or the decisive victory, produce a unique climate of tension, and decisión making.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Maybe the first monster game about the Pacific war. 

The scale of ships and planes is rather low with each ship being a Cruiser (heavy or light), CV or Battleship or a small group for Submarines, destroyers and troop carriers. The planes are classified on the land and ship based and each are further classified by the number of motors (1 for Fighters and naval bombers, 2 for land bombers and some naval and 4 for Strategic bombing) and each of these groups even further with three experience/newer models classifications (L0 for the lowest, L2 for the best planes), there are also spotting planes (land based). The land units represent regiments-battalions-divisions.

It can be played as escenarios that range from an attack (Pearl Harbour attack, introductory) to an operation (Midway or Coral Sea), or campaigns (Guadalcanal campaign to the big campaign covering all the war).

The turns are variable depending if there are engagements and are measured hourly or if there is only strategic movement when the turns are measured in days. 

When there's an engagement the most important issue is achieving surprise, if one side gets surprise (dice rolls counting factors like radar, inteligence level, type of operation, search conducted, etc) it gets a huge advantage in the attack.

The naval-air and naval combat is very detailed and consumes most of the gaming time. On the contrary the land combat is rather abstracted (though it works very well), counting the quality of the opossed troops, some modifiers and the odds.

In general is a very good game (though very long during campaigns) that has resisted well the test of time, IMHO. 

The only downsides are aesthetics: the map, which is rather odd but maybe is more realistic than others and the pieces, very old style with few glamour.

This is probably the best board game I have ever played. The game system and mechanics is genius and the counters and map so detailed. The system truly shows the challenge of operating large fleets and combining them with air and ground forces. Supply challenges are also very realistic. This is a beautiful game to play but demands lot of space and time.

Revised rating:   Now that I've played he game as a series of campaigns rather than the whole war I appreciate the design a lot more.

The game plays great over a campaign.  The man downside is the large number of detection die rolls necessary to accomplish fleet detection.

Could be a masterpiece if Mark Herman's rules were not so ambiguous. I think the operational system is very good, but the strategic system has some problems.  There are no production rules.  In addition, the Allied Player can reduce Japanese shipping only by assigning submarines -- in fact, about half of Japanese shipping losses were caused by other means (aircraft, surface ships and mines).

The best of all the Pacific games, and probably its designer's masterpiece. Extraordinarily playable despite apparent size because of its inclusion of interesting scenarios at every level (Guadalcanal makes a great one- or two-evening game).  From operational carrier game over month-long campaigns to the full war, this one covers it all, and fantastically well. I read the back-of-box blurb and was completely captivated by it. I bought the game and found that (and this may be unique in wargame history) every claim in that blurb is true.

Note: when playing the campaign, you will probably need to brake down the Japanese a bit, otherwise it will be too  easy for a skilled player to kick the Brits out of India.

At first the map puzzled me, but after the first playing everything was clear.

Things In like more: operational planning (what you want to activated and for how much time); aircrew training, combat resulution and codebreaking.

Although i had a nasty experience with 6th fleet, i couldn't resist getting this one... the biggest grand strategy game on the Pacific War!

Great game, but too much of a monster to play the full campaign.  The scenarios are nice, but I always prefer to play the full campaign game, and this one requires a bit too much space.  Too many charts and tables, etc.  Still rates a 5 for the scenarios.

Wonderful game that truly gives you the feel for the theater.  Operational game in a strategic game structure makes it a bit of an odd duck.  The neat thing is that both the operational and the strategic game work within a very small package.  One of the best one table monsters around.

The difficulty is that you are trying to play out the entire war at an operational level.  It can take forever to get to the end.  I have played through the opening campaign twice and enjoyed myself tremendously, but that is only twice in 24 years...

RATING: 8.1
Excellent strategic game of WW2 Pacific.  Despite what you may have heard, this is by no means a monster game - except perhaps the campaign scenarios.  There are over 20 scenarios and only 3 of the scenarios are grand campaigns.  In any case, this is a very good game and a very good system.  I have heard that it is unbalanced, but I'm not a good player enough to know.  Our games have been pretty tight (at least in terms of victory conditions, if not the apparent outcome).

A typical Mark Herman design. Lots of outside the box thinking make this a (just!) playable strategic level look at the Pac war in WW2, although it's really an operational game at heart. I think the smaller battles are a little more balanced than the full war scenario. I like this one because it provides a lot of insight into how operations happened in this theater. Definitely not a simple game, so I wouldn't recommend anyone buy it unless they know what they're getting into. It's playable, but on the high end of the complexity spectrum, both rules wise and game play wise. Still, on the very short list of good games on the subject.

One of the best ever box covers, too.

For its day, one of the best simulations of the Pacific Theater on an operational level.  The map takes a bit to adjust to.  Having played many Pacific games, including three games of WIF, this has remained my favorite over the years.  I have as yet to play the new GMT operational game, so I haven't used that as a comparison.  The strong point of PW is that it accomplished what it was designed to do in the days of the "Monster Game" and it is playable.

Markus Stumptner's ( and others!) house rules (particularly limiting ground units to only 1 move per week) are highly recommended for a more historical simulation.

Victory Games fine rerun of SPI's classic.  Blowing up the Panama Canal (damage the locks) with a Japanese submarine that launches aircraft to do the bombing is a scream: when it works.  Odd man out can play the British and the Chinese forces.  Many possibilities.  Should the Japanese consolidate and fortify or invade the Aleutian Islands?  Or maybe invade and try to conquer India?  The Americans have the forces but where to strike first?

I've played a couple of the more basic scenarios.  It's fun and super cool looking.  Would like to play some of the more advanced scenarios.

2014  - I've played the Engagement scenarios, now on to the Battle Scenarios.  Fun game.  A lot of search and move....probably just like real life.

Mark Herman makes a valiant attempt to simulate the Pacific theater in an operational context.  A lot of details go into the naval and air system and the battle sequence is a gem.  The game is not without flaws and while I have not played the whole war I heard there are gamey tactics out there.  That said, I am a PTO fan and this one is in my permanent collection.

Still the best strategic/operational game. Its brilliant. 

Important: There is a severe miscalculation regarding the time/ground scale for ground unit movement. House rules are available.

A monster game of the Pacific Theater of WWII, with a two-piece map that needs a big table and 2400 counters. I can't rate it, because I haven't actually played it, but the rules look interesting and not overly complex. I did set it up once in a friend's basement: we played maybe one or two turns before we had to pack it back up. Someday...

A confession: I've never played anything bigger than the Battle scenarios.  But this is an unusual monster game where the short scenarios are great games in their own right.  I've played Midway, Flat Top, Fast Carriers, and Carrier; and Pacific War is my favorite game for single engagements.  Mark Herman is THE master of abstraction in wargames.  In this one he even abstracts time -- a "day" does not always equal one day.  But it all works.  I must play at least the Campaign scenarios some day.

Fantastic game with its asthetic value, historical value and time and movement rules.  Unique map gives a different perspective on the entire Pacific theater.  Once again another monster (I admit a complete weakness here...) but it is very playable.
Love how logistic and intelligence play a vital part in outcomes of battles and movement.

Too much long, too much large. Too much micro details. Too much rules. Unfeasible to play

Típico juego "monstruo" inviable de jugar sin divorciarse y sin renunciar a tu vida social. Demasiados micro-detalles para un escenario estratégico. Teóricamente diseñado para desarrollar campañas parciales, y ni aún así. Fichas diminutas y feas con hasta 15 factores diferentes y mapa de papel tamaño DIN A0.

Not an undertaking to be entered into lightly.  Complex and complete.  Campaign and strategic scenarios are the best, but there are few options for the Japanese to alter their historic attitudes (ie in pilot training, in submarine attacks on merchant shipping, in ASW)

This is a monster, but it's how it should be. We tried whole war from 41 to 45. Four game months took us about 7-8 six hour sessions, so the strategic scenario is very long.

Unlike many WWII strategic games, each individual unit in this game has assigned a combat rating according to its historical performance. This gives me some incentive to actually learn and play this game, which is not bad. Just pick the scenario that suits your time commitment.

As far as WWII entire pacific is concerned, this game is very good. Full scenario really takes ages to play (not to mention setting the whole up) but it is somehow worth of it. However, predetermined and nonexistent political ramifications are hard to accept. 
--
Even tough simulation - but not so much of logistics and other things that matter, it lacks some political ramifications for US in case that Japan (somehow) manages to beat American carrier fleet so badly that there is just few left at 1944 with just expense of single IJN carrier. This was the moment my opponent gave up but he would have won eventually if continued. 
--
That said, there are good things in Pacific War, tactical matters that need to be resolved, important decisions after decisions, but at while diminishing Japanese strategic situation is represented by industrial points and effectual oil points - and all the background shuffling going on with Japanese protecting commercial shipping and US trying to cut it out I think that Fire in the Sky will be better game of the aspect I like.

Because Pacific War tries to put player in too many shoes at the same time it becomes very, very long and fills the time with something of a secondary issues. It is one aspect to run whole war strategically and entirely different matter to concentrate on flight coordination and naval target selection of an air strike. I like to do both at times, but not necessarily within same game.

At last playing, there appeared to be one missing British CC.  I got this used, and it shows wear and tear, but is fully functional.  Biggest problem--someone in the past taped the maps together, and then attempted to separate them, so there's some peeling along the seem.  Nothing that prevents playing whatsoever, though.

The Pacific theater presents scale challenges (where destroyers and battalions of troops can be significant on a map spanning thousands of miles). Board games usually omit the smaller units while computer games often have an overwhelming level of detail. But Pacific War does it just right in my view, creating a manageable monster that can represent any engagement/battle/campaign desired.

I really love this game.  I'm a huge fan of WW II games set in the Pacific.  So right away this gets high marks.  I also enjoy attention to detail, and the ability to play small scale battles or play out the entire war, depending on my mood.  This game allows you to go from the very small scenarios to the entire WW II (in the Pacific, of course).

I'm not an expert, but it seems to me that there is close attention to historical detail.

And it LOOKS great.

I salivated over this when it first came out, but didn't purchase it due to my limited funds.  A few months later I graduated from college, and my wife gave me this as a graduation present.  

Because of all of the above, this is my favorite game in my collection.  (There are a few other games that I enjoy playing more, but this is sentimentally my favorite, and would be the last game that I part with.)

An outstanding game. But a real monster!
Set up the campaign game twice but never got very far into it. The second time my opponent wanted to quit and set up Scorched Earth because he said, " We'll get done faster"!
We have managed several scenarios though. And every one was a real gaming pleasure. The search system can be a real nail biter. 
Truly the finest naval simulation I've tried yet!
Definately not for the beginner. You got to be a true grognard for this one!

Above average kids game.  Almost scratches a [b]Piratenbilliards[/b] itch for me.  Pretty well-balanced game that can keep adults interested.  Playing until the tokens are all claimed can be a bit tedious.

Still one of the best dexterity games to play with kids.  Hell, I play this against my family and it is cutthroat - practice definitely will improve your skill in this game.  Fun!

Anybody that thinks this is random either needs to play more or they just suck at it.

Not much of a game here.  Bouncing balls into a grid reminds me of those impossible carnival games where you try to toss a ring around a bottle. Very random.  Luck is the main factor in whether or not your ball lands in a line with other balls (which is how you score points).

Rating for the kids - they have fun with this one.  No skill involved, but good for some fun distraction.  Another tabletop carnival game (see Ring-O Flamingo).

I would rate this higher for the amount of fun I had in playing it, but as a game - it is stunningly simple and I almost had to drop it a point or two for its simplicity.

So....7 rounds it out pretty well.

A complete blast to play!

There's something about this game that's just fun. It's a great game for everyone and the kids will surely love it.

Players are trying to bounce their balls into the grid and trying to score 3 in a row with their colors, while your opponents are trying to do the same, or maybe they're trying to block you or knock your balls out of position.

It's simple, light and very fun and plays quick. Everyone always ask to play again and again.

I had only played Rein damit (not Bounce It In), which was disappointing.  I now see that it was probably the small size which made me not like it very much.  Hop Hop Hooray offers quite a bit of control, making for a fun little game that lasts just the right amount of time.

for me this only works as a three to four player game.

interestingly enough played this in the same week as coconuts and dungeon fighter, both games that share an element with this one.

there is something about it seeing the balls roll. its comparable to throwing dice to resolve fighting .

Yeah, it's a kids game, so what?  Every time I bring this out at a gathering, everyone wants to play.

I got to play with my 5 year old godson, and he loved it (though a couple of times he got so excited, he forgot to let go of the marble to bounce it, and just slammed his hand on the table :)

WIFE COPY

My daughter liked to play this game, so I must admit that I like it too...for the sole purpose of being with my family.  A good game for at least 5 minutes, after that, it begins to overstay it's welcome.

(Commenting after quickly reading through rules):
Probably one of the funniest 4-in-a-row variant (3-i-a-r, actually) as here you must bounce your pieces onto board to form lines of 3 (of your own or other players pieces...).

RATING: 8
An exhilarating game. My wife purchased this one for me, just knowing I would like it, but she was not sure she would really enjoy it. She loves it! The whole mechanic of tossing your marble, having it hit the table and bounce into the interior grid of the game board really is unique. It is fun, great for 2 to 4 players, great for smack talk and bragging, I really enjoy this kids game. A kids game for adults!

As a 2-player game, we now enjoy playing this as a best 2 out of 3 experience. It becomes a true contest of skills and of course plenty more smack talk to be had.

Children's game. You could call it a dexterity game, but you really don't have enough control over the bouncing marbles for skill or thought to count for very much. It is cute, and can be fun for one play at a time.

RATING: 6.5
Another neat little dexterity game. Each player has their own set of marbles. On their turn, they bounce one into the box; the board is a grid with spaces for the marbles to land. If you get 3-in-a-row (any mix of colors), take a VP chit; if it's 3 of your own color, take 2 VP chits. If a single play creates more than 1 3-in-a-row, score them all. The game ends when the chits run out -- the player with the most VP wins! 

Simple, quick ... what's not to like?

Bounce little balls into the big blue box. See the ball bounce. It bounces and bounces then stops. Sometimes it stops to make a line of 3 balls. Success! Sometimes it doesn't make a line of 3 balls. Sadness! We bounce balls for a while, then stop. Player with most Success is the winner.

A nice enough little diversion between games.

Precision aiming isn't really possible, very fun nonetheless. Best with three or four players, takes too long with two.

RATING: 8
Hüpf hüpf, Hurra! is too much fun to be believed, and on top of that requires skill to play - great combo!

You take turns bouncing hard plastic marbles into the box, which serves as the board. You want to get three marbles in a row, any direction, and if you manage this trick then you score a point. You get a bonus point if you score 3-in-a-row of your own color.

The theme is that the frog princess shows up at the local frog pond, and all the boy frogs decide to impress her with their pond diving skills. The points are kisses from the princess. :D

The fact that the VP chips pool is limited to 30 points is a great feature as it means that every game will play at a very good clip.

I highly recommend this to anyone that games with kids, or people that are kids at heart.

RATING: 6.5
Very easy to grasp the objective; not as easy to calibrate how hard or soft to bounce your pieces onto the board, especially for little ones. Still, the game's simplicity and obviousness are excellent, while still allowing for some tricks.

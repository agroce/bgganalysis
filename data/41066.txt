Only played once so this rating could very easily change. Played 6 player so not sure how this suffers from not having the full 6 like Here I Stand but feels like a tight war game that requires everyone to play their role. Feels like there are some incredibly strong cards that can sway the game (cards that kill leaders) but I've really not had enough time to explore this at all.

RATING: 6.5
It lacked a thematic flavor as compared to HIS. The game is shorter due to lesser options as compared to HIS. 

Overall battle is weak, as it was simplified to a dice roll luck battle. 

Card powers are both weak and overly specific. Making game play very dependent on certain happenings on board. It's ok if all players are new to the game, but experienced gamer will be aware of it. 

The rule book was both long winded and not to helpful in terms of actually resolution of the actions. Poorly written for gameplay assistance.

I'm at a loss for words:  a sublime, almost transcendental, solo wargaming experience.  It is immersive and addictive.  There are many games in my collection that I have yet to--but want to!--play.  However, I kind of just want to keep playing this one, over and over.
It's hard to imagine one of those day-long marathon VQ sessions matching the delightful dalliance of savouring each card, each option, each rule.  And the rules are brilliant.  They really are.  I can see how they might provoke frustration, when everyone is awaiting their turn.  But, for the solo gamer, the rules provoke historical reflection and research instead.
For a while now I've wondered whether games with low "solitaire suitability" ratings might, in fact, be the best ones to solo.  These heavenly weeks spent in the basement with VQ are making me think I was right.

Gran juego con un excelente sabor histórico.
CDG multijugador que representa la época a la perfección. Cada potencia tiene sus puntos fuertes y débiles que hay que saber explotar para llevarla a la victoria.
Me resulta bastante inmersivo y aunque tiene un acentuado factor suerte con bastantes tiradas de dados, es algo que no molesta en exceso ya que tienden a compensarse a lo largo de la partida.
Interesante componente diplomático con muchos aspectos que se pueden tener en cuenta en las negociaciones. Múltiples opciones para obtener puntos.
En la parte negativa, es necesario un número alto de jugadores (5 o 6) para poder disfrutar el juego. Esto, sumado con que es un juego bastante largo, dificulta el poder jugarlo con frecuencia.
Si te molestan los multijugadores con efecto líder, también te recomiendo que ni lo pruebes.

RATING: 7
Here I Stand is a corker, so TVQ should be an interesting follow on. Might have to pre order this as well...

Rating of 8 after practice game. Ed Beach has designed another winner here. Rich in period history and more military action than Here I Stand. The rating may be higher but it looks like it will be a long game for the full camapign and mustering 6 players on a regular basis for FTF play is going to be difficult. It is likley that picking up an online game will be easy however and ome ways the game may be well suited to that style of play as each GT is a mini-game in itself and card play and permutations need some careful thought.

RATING: 8.4
At seven hours, Virgin Queen is one of the lengthiest and involved games we own, not to mention heaviest; and thus it's not often likely to come out to table unless we've got a situation with the right players. But it is quite substantial, card driven with dice resolution, six interesting factions to rub up against one another and it also doubles as a history lesson in a box for the world during Elizabeth I's time. Bit of a learning curve especially for those outside the war gaming realm, but it all makes sense and comes together for the proper attention spans.

RATING: 8
One 6-player game. Like Here I Stand, very long ( 9-10h to play 5 full turns, and we didn't quite finish), but interesting game. It's nicer than HIS in that player actions are more varied and everyone can do at least a little of everything. But it felt there was a bit of loss of focus, and in the end I was left feeling that HIS is tighter and the more interesting game.

Played Spain, came very close to auto-winning via gunpowder plot (needed 5 hits with 16 dice, got 4...) We also got a very nice example of how a battle can be truly decisive when a big ottoman naval victory paved the way for their conquest of Malta and domination of the Mediterranean.

Note: The 2-player tutorial scenario is really just that. I think Here I Stand has a much better 2-player mode.

RATING: 6
Tentative review based on one play.

Seems better and more competitive than Here I Stand. You can feel the designer's enthusiasm for the subject matter everywhere. Marriage is amusing.

Still, like HIS its a long (12 hours) affair with a lot of rules overhead for a game that, mechanics wise, is based almost entirely on rolling dice for fives and sixes. A few bad rolls will scuttle your chances of victory. 

Also, VP's are a lot easier to come by for some powers than others, and so the game can become an exercise in futility for some players unless everyone is very, very aware of play balance.

Love the story telling and colorfull line of events in general. 
Too many VP are generated by just a few dice rolls (Artists/Scientists, Marrigies, Piracy.....). I really dont like it how some game deciding element like "scoring cards" (Dutch Revolts, Enterprise of England...) are not presented elsewhere too, open to all, you always have to remember them. In addition some of those events even have some Errata/FAQ taken into account when resolving...this is borderline byzantinistic....like some secret socyetie's lore....

First Impressions: There are many interesting aspects to this game. Each power plays differently, with different victory conditions. Initially you get the feeling that you really only need to concentrate on your closest neighbors but proper diplomacy with all powers is the key to winning. I've got a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. I have no desire to play it but when I do I always have a fun time.

RATING: 6
I really wanted to like Here I Stand more than I actually did.  Unfortunately, the religious conflict was not only the most time consuming activity in HIS, but it was highly irelevant and boring to watch for the Ottomans, France, England, and Habsburgs.  Thanks be to god (and Ed Beach) for streamlining this process in Virgin Queen.     

I also give thanks for the blessing of marriage.  I always found the diplomacy phase in HIS more exciting when dealt cards that could potentially help/hinder my opponents.  The beauty of Virgin Queen is that most powers are now guaranteed to have some man or woman to bring to the bargaining table.  One negative is that the Ottoman player is pretty much excluded from partaking in marriage or the religious conflict.

Virgin Queen is definitely an improvement over Here I Stand.  However, Virgin Queen does share a lot of the same flaws, such as bash the leader and lopsided card draws.  Personally I cannot stand drawing a bunch of 1 CP cards, especially since most actions require 2 or more CP.  Another shared flaw is that the outcome of almost every game mechanic is heavily decided by dice.  In spite of these and other flaws, I am looking forward to my next session of either game.

RATING: 9
After 4 plays it seems as though each faction uses about the same amount of time to complete an impulse, compared to Here I Stand where the Papacy and Protestants typically seem busier than the other 4 factions.  The religious struggle is nicely spread out among 5 factions in Virgin Queen and, while procedurally simpler to understand than the Religious struggle in H.I.S, makes for a more interesting game.  After numerous plays I could not proficiently explain how some of the factions are even able to effectively influence the Religious struggle in Here I Stand and why they would not just leave it all up to the Protestants and Papacy.  Virgin Queen does not have that issue for me.  

The Royals are meant for bargaining and not simply gleaning points from the Wedding chart.  If 2 players agree to marry Royals just to have them marry, then those players have chosen to leave the outcome to the dice.  Use them to bargain for cards, treasure, bargain for a favor, to help convince another faction to end a war and so on.  Pay attention to which Royals are still available and try to time things so that you have the only female for a Turn.  The resolution of the Wedding chart should be the last reason to make use of the Royals as the Wedding chart is not what the Royals are about.  If nobody will give up what you want for a Royal, then go ahead and let them age unmarried.  Most players would not help improve another faction's position on the map or ability to gain VP  or cards through conquest without something in return, why would a player not treat the gains via the Wedding chart or via the Royal's special ability the same way? 

It is a game of negotiation and the die rolling can be mitigated.

6 Player game. 12 hours and we were unable to finish it.
Played it with the Protestants. Got locked in Netherlands, but we missed a part on the Home card.

Nice game, but I feel that HiS is more tense, although I prefer the Religious rules from VQ. Everyone has a word and it is well integrated on the game. On HiS it is a game inside the game.

Rate it with a 8, but it can easily changed.

________________________________________________________
Played the introductory scenario.
It doesn't help much for someone who has some experience with HiS, and the scenario doesn't seem balanced at all. Way to hard for Ottoman.

It is helpful to learn how to deal with diplomatic status only.

I'm giving it an "8" after only one play. A solid step up in complex sub-systems when compared to HIS. Crap there is a lot of stuff going on in this game. It's a fun exercise in chaos since nearly every power can influence the religious battle, New World stuff, killing of leaders, land warfare, naval, piracy, the arts, and more. Ignore any of these and someone is likely pulling away from you. But with the right group of people, it was a blast.

Well, The Virgin Queen has not stood up to much repeat play. The neutral major powers rule are very unsatisfactory. It's still basically the same deal, everyone can see how many victory points everyone has so you just keep hammering the leader until someone sneaks in for the win. Plus, the history is still extremely sketchy, there is plenty of historical chrome but the game mechanisms themselves are not very evocative. The religious conflict is still hollow and time-consuming. Plus it's long. Plus there is a lot of downtime. Plus the deck is still bloated and cardplay is boring. Basically all the same problems as Here I Stand. Too bad. Not sure what I was thinking when I thought Virgin Queen might correct some of the Here I Stand issues.
---
Provisional-ish rating. Played once. Enjoyed, despite issues, and can see potential. Many improvements over Here I Stand, the most important (to me) being a somewhat more nuanced, interesting negotiation phase. The ability to arrange weddings, the new HRE mercenaries power, a slightly more fluid game situation, plus what feels like a more interesting card deck makes for a much more interesting negotiation phase that skews more towards practical deal-making then force of personality and persuasion, which is what I want. Other improvements include a more streamlined religious war, and a more balanced situation - Spain has been cut down from the Hapsburgs, and most other powers get pretty even card draws.

Again, Spain and to a lesser extend the Ottomans are in the driver's seat here. First game, put your fastest-learning player in the Spain position. They need to act as a check on the English, Protestant, and (to a lesser extent) the Ottoman player, and if they let one of the smaller players, particularly England, ride the game is less fun. The Ottomans have been given an option to try to dig the Suez Canal, which sounds totally cool, but for heaven's sake ignore it unless you are forced into it - your Sea Captain is crap, colonies aren't worth points, and a "go east" game is far less interesting than mixing it up in Europe. You have a powerful navy and arguably the most potent army in the game. Don't idle them.

HRE seems like not an awesome player position - they do a lot of Patronage and arranging marriages, fun but not a lot of action - so dropping them for a 5 player game doesn't seem like it would be a major loss.

France is totally different than they are in HIS. In that game, they were in a pivot position, with options to ally with England or Spain and a fair amount of control. Here, they are under the Protestant gun and will be looking to others for help instead of fishing for alliance offers. The Catholic League is bad, but bringing the Spanish in full-bore to deal with your Protestant problem isn't terrible. You can't really expect help from anywhere else, since the English are the Protestant's natural allies. Maybe the HRE, but don't count on it.

The Espionage chart is totally bewildering, but the reason it's there is not for the high-profile stuff - assassinating Elizabeth or the Gunpowder Plot - all of which is basically impossible. The purpose of Espionage is so England and Spain can fight without going to war. It's a game rigged in favor of the English to some degree, but the Spanish have to fight the English in England or else in the end they'll get clobbered by English Industry, piracy, and eventual English victory over the Armada. I don't think Spain can afford to ignore England for too long. So try to stick it too them. Every CP England spends keeping their house in order is a CP not spent raiding your empire, which is a double win.

Sadly, the rules are still a mess, and little attempt has been made to make this game cleaner or accessible. Fine, that's not what it is, but still there is unneeded complexity here, and the rules could have been made much more readable and accessible. It's just not a 42-page complex game. It's actually fairly playable once you find the rhythm. The rules are far more daunting than they need to be, and the aids could have been much better.

Also, it's still a monster, and your first games are likely to have even longer per-turn playing times than HIS did. So do the tournament scenario first, and budget 6 hours. I've sort of convinced myself, though, that once the learning curve is crossed it may well play a little faster and more smoothly than HIS. I hope so.

RATING: 8
1 play, 5 player. Fantastic game, but exhausting.  Not something I'm going to want to play weekly, but fascinating stuff.  It's possible that my experience was heightened due to playing Spain, which has the most going on of any power, with interests all over the board. 

The highlight of the game in my mind is in the interplay between the military/political, espionage, and religious systems.  The patronage sub-game is the least interesting part, though vital for victory points.  Luckily it plays out very quickly.

The major power activation rules for playing with fewer than the full 6 players are serviceable but don't offer much interest. The HRE player (which was Spain at one point and France later), lacking any practical way to gain VP, simply avoided losing them by keeping the Ottomans out of Vienna.  A noble enough calling, but not many decisions to be made.

Where do I begin? This is so much more than a war game. Thematically, it interweaves a beautiful adventure filled with royal marriages, piracy, colonization, circumnavigation and adventure on the high seas, political intrigue and assassinations, and patronizing talented people to bring you honor and prestige. From a gameplay perspective, for all it's complexity, the turn could not be simpler: play a card for it's event or for the point value to perform a variety of different actions. Each faction gives you a unique perspective on how to play the game. The decisions of declaring war can be agonizing and take a toll on you. This game is a masterpiece, thematically and gameplay-wise. When I play Virgin Queen, I think about the game for the next 2 weeks non-stop: about what I could have done differently, and more importantly, about the incredible story that 6 players created together.

I like HIS better. Too complex for me to really enjoy and you get victory points for almost everything, therefore the conflict is not so tense.

On the other side the religion struggle is well done and division Habsburg power into two eliminates the need of "all against the yellow player" strategy.

A very enjoyable experience for those looking for an inmersive, strong history theme. A few aspects of the game could be more streamlined (i.e. patronage and arranged marriages could have been introduced as part of the card driven system) but as a whole it's one of my fav games, I wish I could get to the table more often (It scares the shit out of my regular, eurogamey group).

The cardboard courts of the Elizabethan age.

A great choice of period, cleverly-designed map and  harmonious but rich game mechanics. It's a shame that the scientific and cultural achievements of the Renaissance are managed by tiny cardboard counters. Never mind, this is an engrossing strategic  experience, as well as refined fun.

Strategia ludo pri renesanca Eŭropo.

"Virga Monarĥino" (Elizabeto la 1-a de Anglio, 1533-1603) ne estas  pura milito-ludo : ĝi aspektas pli ĝuste al  densa diplomatio-ludo, kiu simulas la politikajn manovrojn de la (ses) plej potencaj ŝtatoj de Renesanca Eŭropo. 

Ne temas nur pri interŝtataj militoj, ĉar ankaŭ rolas la Protestantoj kaj Katolikoj, kies luktoj estas esence ideologiaj kaj propagandaj. 

Ludo kun belega materialo, sed tamen tre densa regularo : ludante, oni tamen pli-malpli  intuicie forgesas la regulojn, kaj ekĝuas la divers-teman negocadon.

:coffee: :( :what: :what: :) :) :D "Here I Stand didn't have enough chrome for me," said no one ever. Well, along comes Virgin Queen to bolt some tailfins and a hood ornament to that sucka. Be careful what you wish for, no one ever.

The design goals, as I understand 'em, were to better support 4-5 player play, take out the jarring breaks in play whenever the religious players debated the miracle of transubstantiation via dice, and generally open the game up so that everyone has a stake in what's happening in the New World, everyone (well, almost) cares about the religious struggle, everyone has some shiny baubles to chase so that they're not just sending a force to perforate their enemies with a quickness, &c., &c. And mission mostly accomplished.

HIS was a game where you had some useful stuff to do with yourself even if you weren't embroiled in a fight. In VQ, the presence of a war, even one you're fated to win, means precious time and resources taken away from the other work of your realm -- your attitude as to whether this represents a wargame that has truly lost its way or a more realistic approach to geopolitical simulation will go a long way towards determining whether you have any interest in VQ.

2 plays--learning, 6 players. Both times ended after turn 3. First time was about 7-8 hours, 2nd about 6 hours (including meals and unlimited negotiation time). A rich game, evocative, could be a classic of its genre. Played as Ottomans each time. In one session, saw France autowin after earning about 12 VPs in one turn! I didn't know that was possible! I liked the game from the beginning. As I learn the game more, the more I like it. Also the more we learn, the faster we play. My rating will probably rise.

Wow, this game is SO good. There are layers upon layers of options and strategies. Each side plays very different. It's very interesting and VERY fun. This may move to a tie for my favorite game after a few plays. As far as learning; There are a lot of systems, but they're all relatively straight forward and the rulebook is thorough and will laid out. Also there's a tutorial game. If you read through the rulebook two to three times and play the tutorial game you'll have a pretty solid footing to jump into the campaign game. Just set aside either one very long day, or two consecutive days to play your first game.

After reading the rules, looks great!

After playing first game. Not as good as I thought. You end up spending the game doing things that are not very changelling or amusing. Rolling two dice for everything and triying to bring home the vp´s, without real action: battles, campaings or movements...

I finally prefer better the HIS

Of course the tematic is a 10.

I tried this game half a dozen times and it feels like it has a lot of potential but it just does not deliver.
Very limited military operations, limited by cards, board constraints and combat requirements. In this department I feel like game stepped backwards from "Here I Stand".
Silly "artist" and "scientist" mechanics, very unrealistic.
Even sillier wedding mechanics.
Interesting naval capabilities including pirating.
Has decent theme but many rules are not very logical and defy common sense.
Slows down as you move forward and has effect of lost interest depending on how things progress.

Had a hard run the first time I played, getting smashed after an unforced error and then being completely out of the game, nothing to do but roll with the blows. New players have huge disadvantage when playing with those who really know the cards, which was an issue in my play. But even so not sure I'm the best at long range subtlety, negotiation and deal making games.

Love history ? Have a lot of spare time ? Looking for a great game to play ? You've found it !!
Waaaaaw !! This is a game I really loved. Hot war, cold war, religious war, pirating on the high seas, noble marriages (and divorces), stimulating the arts and sciences, diplomatic struggles... It's all there...except for the assassination victory points. As if the designer did not want his game to be perfect...I understand, you always have to leave some room for improvement. In this case the room left is very, very tight.

RATING: 2
Update: Oops, further play has revealed several fundamental problems I am having with the game.

First and foremost, the game is not balanced properly, at least not for the tourney scenario. A simple deck analysis reveals that there are basically no direct events that benefit the HRE. Compare that to cards like [i]John Hawkins[/i], [i]Sea Beggars[/i], [i]St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre[/i], and so on. Especially if the right card happens to fall into the right power's lap. The HRE is basically left hoping for the perfect confluence of cards, dice and reasonable opponents to negotiate with. If those stars don't align, forget about it. Frankly, the HRE reminds me of Prussia in [i]The Napoleonic Wars[/i]. Yes, you [i]can[/i] make it a player power, but it really ought to be a minor. This is born out by the rather atrocious record of the HRE at tournaments, where the HRE is basically only winning on hail mary game events and/or incompetent opposition.

Second, the single giant deck is just too swingy in terms of how the game will play out. All the tactical and diplomatic skill in the world won't add up to jack shit if you can't get the cards. This is not a game that's long enough, especially if you're playing the tournament scenario, for the cards to even out. Games like [i]Sword of Rome[/i] with their individualized decks got this right.

Third, military operations are just too goddamned hard. This is the result of several elements, including generally crappy leaders, not enough leaders, leaders that can too easily be assassinated, the general take-that nature of the deck, and the fact that every key must be sieged. Since it's relatively easy to build those keys up four units deep, you're now relying almost entirely on card events to win sieges. And again we're back to the luck of the draw as a deciding factor.

Fourth, the whole marriage system feels disconnected from the overall narrative. There's no connection between marriages, influence, alliances and wars at all. Plus, you can get a goofy narrative where Elizabeth can jilt the same guy over and over again.

Fifth, and this ties back into the difficulty with military operations, is that when people camp the game  essentially degenerates in the world's most complex eurogame, with certain powers having the ability to get VP just performing mundane tasks with zero risk. Oh, except the HRE. Derp. Otherwise, people just do stuff like patronage or nickel and dime you with piracy. Dull, dull, dull. Oh, and did I mention that [i]everyone[/i] can do piracy now? Not just the Ottomans. Yet more screwage.

Sixth, the informant/spying system is a total screwjob. Outside of some very specific circumstances for one country in particular, there's basically no defense against it. Which means you can far too easily knock cards out of your opponents hands, and any leader rated less than a 2 outside its home territory can expect to be assassinated. And did I mention that assassination will also knock a card out of player's hand and score a VP? Hilariously awful. In a multiplayer CDG hand management is absolutely crucial, and getting cards knocked out of your hand willy nilly can be absolutely devastating. [i]The Napoleonic Wars[/i] understood this and handles it well with resources, and all the nasty hand-affecting cards are relegated to one-time events. Here, not so much. To add insult to injury the system also makes turn order far too relevant due to the one turn delay on informant effects, as the Ottomans and Spanish can get their informants in place before other players, and knock out other player's informants before they have a chance to act. The whole thing is just irritating as shit.

Seventh, the religious struggle has been streamlined, yes, but at the expense of being interesting. With [i]Here I Stand[/i] you at least had an compelling little sub-game between the Catholics and Protestants with the individual debaters and their special abilities. Seeing a debater disgraced or burned at the stake was great fodder for talking smack at the table. Here it's just roll some dice, flip some counters. But worse than that, the fact that a "1" causes unrest has created some gaminess where players try to time their conversions near the end of the round in order to deprive opponents of keys (and thus cards and VP) by placing unrest on them at the last possible moment, with the actual conversions being a secondary concern. Lame.

Eighth, the whole English Catholic Rebellion moonshot is a really unsatisfying way to see a game end. Hours (or months PBEM) of game time that all comes down to a single die roll. Why did I bother to play again?

Lastly, the chrome is just driving me batty, much more so than [i]Here I Stand[/i] ever did. Just so many little rules that I constantly have to look up, with stuff like minor differences between "galleys" and "galleons". Why make that distinction in a game this abstract and at this scale? Anyway, the result is that it's almost impossible to teach this game, and everyone will need to do at least a once-over on the rulebook to really get through it, and you can expect a lot of lookups while you play. Even then, expect lots of screwups. To wit, 5 turns and 6 months later, people are still messing up little things in the PBEM game I'm playing as I write this.

As a general comment I'll also quickly add that, short of horrible die rolling and general incompetence by all players involved, there is no chance this game will go the full 7 turns, so I have to question just how well the thing was playtested. Note that [i]Here I Stand[/i] seems to suffer the same issue.

Anyway, the net result is that this isn't a wargame. This is a boring, luck-heavy, and overly complex action selection eurogame with a broken conflict model that limits players to poking each other with a stick, and not much more. [i]Here I Stand[/i] is clearly the superior game.

TL;DR: chocolate and pizza don't mix.
---
An excellent continuation to [i]Here I Stand[/i] and, I think, a slightly better game.

The 4p and 5p options are a welcome addition. I like the patronage system, and the way the minor powers and new world are handled. It also feels like the game will have more variation overall compared to HiS.

The Protestant player will be the most challenging to play, as you have a few options on how to approach your overall strategy, but you must decide early.

On-line play only but it's a great game that way. Feels a bit more random than HIS with more take that cards. Time will show if it's too much.

I must say I prefer HIS to this. Too many take that cards and too much randomness here.

Update: The more I play it the less I like it. By giving all players several fronts you have just created a situation where no-one dares to do anything in fear of overextending and exposing themselves.  This paired with all the take that cards they have introduced in VQ creates a game where you don't want to be the leader unless you're sure of winning right now which seldom happen. Rating down to a 7.

RATING: 8
A very deep, not overly complicated but complex game about a very interesting era of history. Don't be put off by the thick rulebook, since the game and it's systems are not that complex. The only thing is there is so much that can be done and each and every factions play very differently with different path to victory. The first game can be overwhelming but will no doubt leave you with a feeling that "oh, if i had done this, then this would have happen and i could have...", which is a very good thing in my book.
Not sure i'd set up a game with people who've never read the rulebook though as explaining this game would be long and maybe problematic.
Oh, and the thick rulebook? just a very thorough one which covers all aspects of the game in details. Lots of repetition as well, to make sure that when you look for a rule, you'll find it.
Very highly recommended 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The strange thing about VQ is that it looks like a wargame, but building an army and taking people's keys is the least efficient way to score points, and a prolonged stalemate will likely knock both players out of the running.  It's just so much easier to score points with piracy, weddings, and patronage, so the peace dividend is very, very high.

But that, in turn, captures how the second half of the 16th century differed from the first, and from Here I Stand.  I'm not sure how I feel yet about "slot machine" payouts from piracy, weddings, and patronage, but I've enjoyed my first few games, and the rest of the groups has as well.

2015-11-28 : Very thematic wargame with oodles of chrome, where every power has to be played in a very different way, yet the game isn't railroaded and you need to make real decisions all the time. It's also one of those games that tell a story and where you will remember the notable things that happened. And it's also one of those games where you go "next time I'll do this and that differently" which is the mark of an excellent game.

It's games like these that make me realize that I am not truly a wargamer. 

For me, this game is immensely complex, beyond the point I could successfully run a game while teaching effectively. I have attempted this, which was a slog of 5 hours or so and only accomplished completing 1 or 2 turns. 

However, when I have played with all experienced players, I liked this game very much! Of the multiplayer card driven war games, this seemed to be the most interesting since the focus is not only on field battles but also diplomacy, piracy, exploration and smart (and usually thematic) card play. 

You also get to roll lots of dice and get to look at a pretty map for 5+ hours. 

With experienced players, 8 for sure. I would personally avoid teaching new players unless all were invested, read the rules, and brought a copy of the rules with them.

RATING: 4
After one long-ass learning game:

This was my most highly anticipated game of 2012. Really, it was the ONLY game I was highly anticipating. And I'm feeling really lukewarm about it.

My group plays a lot of HIS, so there was a degree of de-programming to be done.  We also flubbed some rules, and lacked an understanding of the power dynamic, so hopefully subsequent plays will improve my opinion.

I LOVE the streamlining of religious rules. I also like all the options, though I'm really not sure why so many don't come in until halfway through the game. Worse, almost none of the new nifty chrome ever got used. There are COOL things to do, but they haven't been translated into FUN game activities.

Ultimately, Here I Stand oozes theme in a way that this just doesn't. Every power in HIS has its own role, its own limited sphere of influence, and plays very differently.  I can see that pedigree here, but I can't help but feel that the powers are more "same-y."  I LIKE the base game mechanics, and I LIKE the ideas of the chrome, I just feel sort of like Ed Beach put chocolate syrup, which is good, on top of pizza, which is also good, and ended up with a gross chocolate-syrup covered slice of pizza. (In this belabored metaphor, Here I Stand is a slice of pizza. FYI.)

Perhaps most of all, I miss the promise of excommunicating motherfuckers, which was honestly why I played HIS in the first place.

Improves upon the religious portion of HIS considerably, and overall this is much more fun than HIS. Unfortunately, as the opportunities to score points other than from geographic maneuvering have increased, so has the sense that obtaining victory points is just a crap shoot. Spend a few CP on Patronage, marry off a royal or two, and cross your fingers. In other words, for my tastes this lacks a strong enough connection between strength or weakness of play and victory or defeat -- succeed on a couple rolls and you look like a superstar, fail on the same rolls and you look like a chump. 

Though it could be claimed that one player getting particularly lucky with dice could be offset through formal or informal agreements to gang up against them, those lucky rolls can suddenly end the game due to automatic or domination victory conditions being met, thus allowing no opportunity to respond. That the rolls occur at the end of a turn rather than the beginning is significant. And it is nevertheless a bit too 'gamey' for me when everyone is in a panic, struggling for a way to respond to a runaway leader who perhaps did absolutely nothing clever or creative to earn their lead. 

I have also seen it argued that the key to avoiding the outcomes I describe above is to keep pressure on other players such that they cannot afford to devote CP to Patronage, but that seems to me a tacit acknowledgement that that portion of the game detracts from the overall experience. It is impractical to expect that through several turns all six players can be prevented from spending 2 CP on this action. And if it was a conscious design decision to make it easier to get away with turtling, then it was a bad decision. As to the royals, I have seen players praise the interesting negotiations possible over marriage proposals, but the only reason a royal has any bargaining value in the first place is because of the random windfall of VPs they may produce -- highlighting the negotiation aspect merely obscures this fact. Eliminate the end-of-turn marriage rolls and the royals other than Elizabeth would have zero intrinsic value. 

Rather than the influence of luck being reduced as players become more experienced, the luck of a few final die rolls is likely to increase in significance. I foresee veteran players managing to keep VPs close throughout the game. Thus, there could be dramatic swings from last place to first, or vice versa, due to late-game rolls. Players faced with little hope of acquiring keys late in the game will quite rationally choose to instead devote CPs to the roulette wheel aka the Patronage board. Other players will feel pressure to do the same in order to avoid a 'cheap' loss. Then the final order of finish will be determined entirely by the Patronage and marriage rolls. 

Since it is clear that the Patronage and Marriage rolls are not going to disappear from the game, the question is simply whether you can live with their effects. I don't mean to give the impression that this is a bad game. My comments are simply meant as a warning for other players who, like me, feel no sense of accomplishment from winning a flip of a coin. OK, VQ isn't quite THAT random, but it is random enough to be unsatisfying to a certain type of player, and you probably already know if you are one of those (us).

RATING: 5.5
Sequel to one my favorite games.  I need more plays but I'm comfortable rating it and commenting on it.  I'll give it more chances so consider this in flux.

Overall, this game suffers from the "too much" syndrome.  Too much going on.  Where HIS suffers from being too static, too predictable, this game is too wide open.  It's the equivalent of every euro (worker placement comes to mind) that presents you with a bewildering decision space and tells you to go to town.  But only some of those decisions are good and you need to somehow know which those are.

The other problem is that this sequel really moves the game outside of wars.  Save for some predictable powers, there really isn't much incentive to fight wars.  Why?  Because you grab the tons of VPs floating around that don't require contestation.  I don't feel like there is as much point to trying to acquire expensive, zero-sum VP represented by keys.  HIS suffered a little from this, this game suffers a lot from it.

What would be best would be to have a game somewhere between HIS and VQ.  Though if you have to choose I would recommend HIS.  It has some problems, but those tend to reveal themselves after many games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is probably the best card-driven multi-player war game I've played. If you've played HiS, VQ expands on that game by allowing all powers to participate in most actions available while still maintaining a very strong asymmetry between powers. In addition, there is even more integration between the various powers so each power has more ability to affect the position of the other powers. There are also simply more options available and balancing resources is a huge part of the game. I almost hesitate to even call VQ a war game because combat becomes only one part of the experience. Players spend just as much time in piracy, arranging marriages, converting populations, intrigue, patronizing the arts and sciences, and exploring the new world as they do jostling for the limited board space. A brilliant game that I will be playing more of in the future. Excellent work Ed Beach!

Good game but long. I think it's the classic multi-player, epic, CDG. There can be some down time as other players make their moves/actions, but I am mostly busy trying to think of other actions and or plotting. A fair amount of chrome and additional modes of play keep it interesting without making it overly complex. In my opinion, as good as or better than Here I Stand. I would give it an 8 but for the length required to play.

RATING: 8
I give this game "8" just for the components. I can't wait to play the actual thing. I'm also pretty happy that the game has different setups that make it possible to play the whole thing in a reasonable timeframe. 

UPDATE
Playing the game over PBEM, and I'm playing the Ottoman. 
As for now I'm feeling some frustration, not for the game per se, but relatively to what other positions can do in the game. 

The Ottomans have basically to wage war and that's it. 
They are cut out of the weddings game, also the diplomacy game seems pretty restricted to only Venice. 
As for artists and scientists, they have one less than anyone else. 

The can't access to colonization till they excavate the Suez canal, which takes a huge amount of resources to do so, so it is something they will do only after some time, unfortunately. 

What can I say? In games such as these I like to dedicate myself to all activities, not only the military one, or building military units one. I'm not very happy that my options are down to a full scale war with Spain, or the Holy Roman Empire and that's it. 

Future moves will tell what I think of this game.  

UPDATE
Ok the game has become more involved. I'm having a lot of fun in this learning PBEM game, there's a lot going on!

Drawing comparisons to Here I Stand is inevitable, but also unwise.  VQ is not like HIS.  

First of all, it is much more granular.  More detailed rules on just about everything and all players need to have a larger grasp on the rules, unlike in HIS.

Secondly, instead of trying your best to gain a VP victory like in HIS, in VQ you must also actively attempt to prevent other powers from achieving victory.  There are so many more VPs just floating around that to not work hard at preventing VP gain can quickly end the game.

Thirdly, it takes longer to "catch".  About 3 hours into my first HIS game I was hooked.  It took till my third full game to really enjoy VQ.  Now, after I reached that point I realized its brilliance.  No one is down and out, like can sometimes happen in HIS, and likewise, everyone has more of a hand in everyone else's pies.  This can lead to a lot of weird interactions, but keeps everyone on their toes.  

Fourthly, diplomacy is a lot craftier and a lot more ugly.  Lies, deception, double-crossing, and the like are much more likely to happen here than in HIS where it was almost always worth it to keep your word.

Summary: Learn HIS first and enjoy it a few times.  After you have the basic mechanics down, switch to VQ and be patient with it.

Impressive follow-on effort to Here I Stand.  The combination of non-combat options gives it a denser diplomatic dimension, which was one of the strong points of HIS to begin with.  But that helps the non-muscular powers such as HRE to compete, and forces the muscular ones to engage in diplomatic countermeasures.  I consider this a very rich game on a rich period.

A bit too much chrome for my taste . . . Here I Stand seems more palatable.  VQ seems to offer almost too many ways to score points.  I also prefer the religious conflict system of HIS, maybe because I've won more often as the religious powers than otherwise :)

I might just be done with multiplayer 'take-that'/kingmaking/diplomacy style games.  But even if you are into those types of games, I think there is some serious over-rating going on with VQ.

First, it's long.  Pretty much too long to play F2F unless you are playing the tournament scenario.  I gave PBEM a try and I can say that this game isn't deep enough or interesting enough to want to put months into it.

Second, you need to talk 5 other people into playing to make it work.

Third, the deck.  You have a huge deck that gets reshuffled every turn.  Over the course of a game, the luck-of-the-draw is not going to balance out, and wild swings in fortune that have nothing to do with player skill will result.  The difference between an average draw (2-3CP cards with events that don't help you) and pulling some of the 5CP events that do help you is massive.  If each player had a deck that wasn't reshuffled, at least you would know that a bad turn is probably going to be followed by a good turn.  As is, you can draw crap all the way through the 8-16 hour game and never get a great hand of cards.

Fourth, and this is the primary game killer, the main things you do in VQ (besides playing screw-you events on other people that were gifted to you via card draw) are marriages, patronage, assassinations, diplomatic influence, and piracy.  These give you VP for essentially zero risk, assuming you can roll dice well.  Some players also get VP as a bonus for not doing anything (e.g. French Paris VP, Elizabeth Virgin VP).  All of these things are incredibly boring.  Military campaigns, while possible, are very rarely going to be worth the effort if you look at VP/risk versus card expenditure.  Keep in mind that a military adventure will probably also get you assassinated shortly after you leave your home territory.  With military action (and thus war between the major powers) being the least useful thing to do, what real diplomacy is there to have?

So, to summarize:  Draw your random cards, play the events that screw other people.  Whine/complain/lie to get the other players to screw everyone else instead of you.  Marry your royal off, roll dice well.  Patronize an artist, roll dice well.  Conduct piracy, roll dice well.  Drop some points on diplomatic influence, roll dice well.  Conduct an assassination, you don't even have to roll well. There are some spins on this for each power (e.g. if France, park 4 guys in Paris so you get your Paris VP, if England, don't get Liz married), but unlike HIS, each power is not all that unique; while the HRE does marriages, the Ottomans do Piracy - call it what you will, but it is still 'spent some CP, rolled the dice for VP').

Bleh.  You would actually have to pay me to play this again.

-------------------------------------------------------

While some parts of VQ are better than HIS, I think, in general, that VQ suffers from less tension and less theme.  In particular, I really miss The Pope and VQ seems to have too many mechanics that push for sitting back and just playing defense (marriages, patronage, etc.).

It is really disappointing that the marriage system is basically unhinged from the diplomatic influence system, or any other game mechanic.  Yes, you can't be at war to propose the marriage, but you can start one immediately afterwards.  The 'marry myself' strategy (Liz and Leicester, looking at you) is also pretty lame when the idea is to force diplomacy between the players.

VQ, like HIS, also has the problem of being long, somewhat complicated, and kind of falls apart if someone doesn't do their part to keep their natural game enemy in check.

It might be interesting to play each faction once to get the real feel for the game, but after full games as England, Protestants, and France, I think I will just have to leave Otto, HRE, and Spain unexplored.

I am more interested in getting more play of this than anything else currently - it is a complete ball to play, I feel there are constantly interesting decisions to be made and things to think about. And the story it tells is just excellent. Each side play very differently - each is essentially playing a small subset of the game which then ripples out into the powers on the periphery of its game. Example: France is primarily concerned with holding together in the face of Huguenout rebellions whilst marrying where possible, but the success of France impact how much work the Prots can put into the Netherlands, which impacts Spain heavily, and subsequently the English and Ottoman. The game is presented as a wargame, but conquest is only a key elements for a few powers, other have to focus on retaining what they have whilst making enough room to explore their other victory avenues. The diffuse incentives make the game rewarding to replay, coming to understand the indirect levers that effect position is deeply satisfying.

The diplomacy in this game keeps getting better. Early plays all focussed around the marriages, but now even powers who seemed like diplomatic non-entities are big players: the Ottomans pretty much didn't do any diplomacy in early plays, but now playing them I want to try to buy/sell peace with one of my big military enemies (Spain/HRE) so I can focus on the other, whilst buying one of my chosen target's enemies as an ally to keep them busy. So good. SO GOOD.

Realised we have been playing this game wrong after 5 plays. Thought the domination victory was always available, but it is only available after turn 4. This had always chafed a bit as we would often have situations where people couldnt take the action they wanted early game as they would hand the game to someone else. Want to replay very much.

Epic monster, completely worth its time
Good: Epic, very thematic, many options/strategies, very asymetrical, very memorable
Bad: Downtime can be pretty bad, assasinating a leader can be (too) devastating, some powers (ottoman, england) not as interesting, hard to get to the table, huge amount of luck involved (for a game of this depth)

More emphasis on exploration, scientific discovery and the arts to build victory points.  Like Here I Stand, its main drawback can be its length meaning it doesn't see the table as often as it deserves.  Nevertheless, highly recommended.

I can't really compare Virgin Queen fully with Here I Stand as I have only played the latter once. Virgin Queen is a very thematic game that moves still further away from traditional wargame territory than HIS. At first there almost seem to be too many extra elements on top of the military and religious conflicts: marriages, piracy, colonies, circumnavigation, patronage of artists and scientists, espionage. However, a couple of plays is sufficient to master these various strands.

Update after 5 more plays.

This game might be the best CDG ever.  The balance in it is really tight.  All the nations can win, and some crazy fun things can happen.  

I can't recommend this game enough....if you want to play a long CDG, this one should be it.

updated comments from my original review:

Positives:

1 - same
2 - Ottomans are can be really good in VQ.  They are FAR superior to HIS
3 - The New World is very, very good

Negatives:

1 - Religion is not lame.  It's really outstanding.  The religious tension is fantastic in this game.
2 - I rescind my comment.
3 - ok, the 1 CP cards really still suck.  I jut finished a game playing the British where I started with a 1,1,2,2 hand.  I won.  Freaking unbelievable.  I never had a 5.
4 - French can, and do win.   My play as France I did terribly.  After we figured out how to play France...France is ALWAYS a threat.
5 - still true.  No natural reason to attack the Spanish.  At all.  Although you REALLY want to...its just not practical.  They should have made it more practical to do it.
6 - true.
7 - totally untrue.  The French have to chase VPs in other ways.
8 - Just finished a game where the French ended at 25VPs and only lost because I was ahead of them by 1 VP the turn before.
9 - I'm sure this comment is still true.  We simply don't play with less than 5 anymore.
10 - never seen Spain win again without Gunpowder Rebellions 

It's true combat is rare.  This game is all about mutual shared destruction keeping combat from happening.  It rarely does, but when it does, it usually is a swing moment.

-------------------------------------------------------

One play as France.  Lots of positives and negatives

Positives first:

1 = Religion isn't the beating it is in HiS.
2 = The Ottomans don't look like quite as lame to play
3 = The New world isn't completely lame

Now  the negatives:

1 = Religion is still a bit lame
2 = The Ottomans are still lame, just not quite as bad
3 = The 1 CP cards SUCK
4 = The French get attacked by everyone except the Ottomans early on
5 = The English have no natural reason in the game to do what they traditionally did....kick the Spanish' ass.  
6 = The deck is choke full of Spanish positive events.
7 = The French essentially have to sit and combat Protestants the entire game.  they are 2 keys away from winning to start the game, but they don't have any feasible way of ever getting a key victory...its quite boring.
8 = it certainly appeared that the French have little way to win as the game goes deep.  Their ability to do arts/science simply dries up as they stop getting guys who can do it...this seemed unfair.
9 = its crazy advantageous in a non-6 player game to have control of one of the card wielding factions...knowing that the Ottomans have a card that is required to switch one of the factions the English can chase is quite imbalancing.
10 = The Spanish appear to be very hard to beat.  I don't know if it goes past turn 3 if the +5 VP differential isn't going to happen quite a bit.

All-in-all I think its average.  It takes a long time for what it is.  The combat is almost not used, yet the rulebook commits more than half its self to said combat.

RATING: 7.5
Fascinating game of an equally fascinating time, there is a price to be paid for all the detail and richness here with rules overhead & game length but I really appreciate what Mr. Beach did here, I just would never want to have to learn a game like this from scratch on my own. 

It is the most in depth wargame I have played to date, and note I have not played HIS (have wanted to for long time) so can't compare but its easy to see from the comments that while it improves in some areas it detracts in a couple of others. I see some people saying VQ has more options than its little Brother, and yet I found here that game-scope options did not seem that plentiful and some stuff feels somewhat scripted (maybe more so for HRE?) and Protestants looked the worst(note I didn't play them though),  however having said that, some of the options you DO have can be quite interesting! Who do you align with and when, who to go to war with and when, Marrying is less interesting but you need to be careful, who to spy on and maybe try to assassinate, which events do you play and when, what kind of deals to make and with who, these are all the MEAT of the game.  I do enjoy card-driven wargames, and also the 'diplomacy' aspect of cooking up side deals with other players and the whole meta-game aspect(usually good fun in right group) so these things are right up my alley, what isn't are the hoards of dice rolling and the downtime in a game like this. 

Its definitely a game that is going to reward repeat playings, and probably with the same group but that is not going to be easy given the length. I'm not sure how keen I am on the war aspect being dumbed down, but since more war involves more dice-rolling maybe its just as well for me and note all the other things going on are nifty (though they are also mostly determined by luck). To me its an experience game due to card draw and dice factor combined, and so a very long one for that type but also it can be a very damn good one too when approached the mindset of just having fun with it.

A nice follow up to Here I Stand but I think there are a couple of things that don't work as well.  I think it was designed to be flexible with the 5th and 6th players and practically, they became unnecessary.  I think it's great to have a 4 player option whereas HIS only works great with a full 6 players but I think if I have 6 six players, I'd usually pick HIS over VQ.

Virgin Queen is an impressive multiplayer simulation encompassing multiple theaters of conflict, from military, religious and diplomatic to piracy and the arts.  Historically detailed and well balanced, this game is a treat to play, if a bit overwhelming the first time.

I've never played Here I Stand, VQ's acclaimed predecessor, but I highly recommend Virgin Queen to anyone who loves history and has the patience for a 5+ hour game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Only one play, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

The military, political, card play and economic systems are pretty much a straight lift from parent game Here I Stand (a fantastic game in its own right), although the New World, religion and piracy sections are different, and the marriage and art / science sections are brand new.

While the roots clearly show through,, this seems a looser game than HIS with more options for scoring points available to each player. The need for good diplomatic skills is arguably even more important with the greater possibilities for faction interaction.

Happy to play either game, although I wouldn't call either short.

I've got a few plays under my belt now in various permutations (6P, 5P, Campaign, Tournament). My early feeling is that it's a richer, more varied experience than Here I Stand, but slightly inferior as a game. 

There are heaps of ways to earn VP, and armed conflict is easily the least efficient way. That may be appropriate for the period, but I suspect the player community will quickly realize this and tend to cut deals for the choice cuts of meat on the board. The Ottomans and the HRE might be the most egregious example, as a CP-heavy, drawn out contest for Buda is probably a lowering tide that drops both boats.

On the plus side, the marriage subgame is folded in well, and adds an interesting angle to an already rich diplomatic playing field. The patronage component feels a bit more tacked on, and a couple of the science bonuses on offer are real clunkers that will almost never get claimed (e.g., Telescope). Espionage is a superb addition, although some of the sexiest outcomes--such as an assassination of Elizabeth I or the Gunpowder Plot--should never be even remote possibilities if the English player has a pulse. 

The rules on activation of minor powers are substantially different and have caused no end of confusion, even for experienced HIS players. The amount of errata (rules, and sadly components too) is a bit deflating--I didn't expect there to be this much, but that just highlights how exceptional HIS was in this regard. Happily, the game is quite playable with 4 or 5, where HIS was a complete bust with those numbers. Don't bother attempting this as a 2 or 3 player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is a military game driven by event cards and takes place after the reformation. Protestants and Catholics are still battling back and forth for influence. There are even marriages to negotiate and technology and artistic developments to be made. The game is actually pretty interesting, but the extensive rulebook and length of the game, about 12 hours can be tiring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Lots of cards which negate other events, steal cards from other's hands, or remove troops from the map makes this a less strategical game with more take-that feel than its sister game Here I Stand. Also much less of a wargame than HIS. 

There is more of a divide between the "protagonists" (England, France, Spain) who are involved in lots of things and the sideshows (Ottoman, HRE) who more sit in their corner and do their own thing. Some countries just don't interact as much with the rest of the players as others.

All changes are negative developments compared to HIS. VQ is not as bad in the take-that aspect as the Napoleonic Wars, but seems to be moving in that direction.

A behemoth of a game that will need 12 hours in a normal group, i.e. with players that don't know the rules by heart. As its predecessor, it should be played with six players but Virgin Queen is playable with 4 or 5 players already.

The core is the map-based conflict game of capturing keys. Various systems are bolted to this centerpiece. It starts with a short diplomacy phase that works well once players get up to speed. Religion is a second area of conflict with the Protestants and the Catholics duking it out in four zones of conflict. Furthermore, there's a colonial subsystem, piracy, marriages, protection of arts and sciences and espionage. A few neutral powers can be influenced and controlled. All this is card-driven.

The powers are asymmetric. The Ottomans are playing their own game of piracy and conquest, not worrying about religion or marriages. The Spaniards start strong but will have a hard time defending what they have. The French play the arts and marriage game, hoping to avoid conflict as much as possible. The English have their strength in the colonial system and ships. The Protestants start without any units on the map or any points. They have to push hard in the religious system to gain worldly power as quick as possible. The HRR is flexible in choosing its goals on the map and has the power to choose its religious association.

Virgin Queen is a challenge but it's worth tackling it. The multitude of options guarantee that a unique experience is created. Each player can identify with the story of his power. For some, it will be a constant struggle while others thrive and seem to get all what they need. Card draws and die rolls add significant luck but even a bad turn can be compensated when other players can be convinced to engage the leaders.

I really wanted to like this. Loved the use of cards as Op points or events similar to Twilight Struggle. But this game suffers from huge downtime and a lot of randomness. Not to mention a long, poorly written rulebook. Don't get me wrong, I love heavy long games but the combat rolls are just too random. Same with prestige rolls, again just too random. There will be great difficulty finding six players for this one, and with all the time spent on this, first game could go for 10-12 hrs use that spare game time on a COIN game or go play Europa Universalis on the computer.

I think I prefer HiS over Virgin Queen but perhaps another play would change my perspective.  The most experienced player in the game played the Spanish and was dominating most of the game although the rest of us finally worked together to slow him down late...but not quite enough.  While most countries can do almost everything, there is definitely a disparity in the capabilities of doing everything.  That one Protestant colony may not be worth pursuing.

I would easily buy this game, but the time commitment issue and the fact that this one is better with at least 4 players mean it should not hit the table often.

Still thinking about it, though, as its theme efficiently hooks me up and, all in all, this one seems to be an awesome game.

2 4P games.  Totally awesome.  Fun, interesting, overwhelming choices, lots to discover.  Probably a 10.  Simply a great and classic game.  Very highly recommended.

Rated a 9 after 4 4P.  Thinking it may be a 10.  I can't stop playing it.  The best impulse buy for a game for me in my 40 years of gaming.  If you have people who like heavy games this is the one.  Our games take less than 4 hours for 4 players also.  They go by very quickly.

And it goes to a 10 after four more games.  So, after 8 games all I want to play is Virgin Queen.  After 40 years of gaming, this monster is one of the most captivating games I have ever played.  Completely destroys any of the old and big multi-player games (Diplomacy takes twice the time and give a lousy play experience in comparison - newer is sometimes much, much better).

Como su juego predecesor [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17392/here-i-stand]Here I Stand[/url], Virgin Queen da mucha sensación histórica y comparte bastantes mecánicas del juego anterior. Ahora con las reglas del conflicto religioso dinamizadas y más opciones, como espías, mecenazgo de artistas y científicos, más exploración del mundo e incluso matrimonios entre casas reales!

Excellent game, worthy follow up to Here I Stand. Lots going on, so many choices they are a bit overwhelming. The game does not play very fast and the cards have a lot more text than HiS, so even reading them takes more time.  But I would play this whenever asked.

RATING: N/A
Complicated, but in a lot of good ways.  The different countries and factions are not the same, their interests overlap in interesting ways, and multiple paths to victory points makes this a deep game with plenty of replay value.  Getting players enough together, being sure of the rules, and having the time to finish will be an issue.

After another play, I think this is a game I will enjoy (stressfully) but never be much good at: I am too much of a wargamer and war is only one of many ways to victory in this game.

RATING: 9
Perhaps the most historical depth I have ever seen in a game. The new rules for religious conflicts, colonization plus a slightly faster play time gives Virgin Queen the edge over it's predecessor Here I Stand. 

The rules themselves are downright daunting even for veteran wargamers. The rulebook really could have used examples. While the playbook does have a short example of play it's not as useful as I think the game's complex rules required. 

Great game and an amazing achievement in game design but for advanced wargamers only.

I'm happy to see a strategic game about this era. I recommend reading "After the Armada" by R.B. Wernham to get a feeling for the english intervention with land troops on mainland europe.
*******************************************************
Preliminary Rating. First game was a disappointment. In comparision to HIS military options curtailed, religious aspects curtailed, instead some more abstract mechanisms added, which gives the impression of a lot of different isolated side-shows.
Perhaps the historical setting does not fit with the geographical scale - the political theaters were much more separated then in the HIS era. HRE and Ottoman look somewhat artifically added as some sort of eastern theater (Hungary, Med), while the western theater is too "small" - in map space, in events, in things that could be done. In the HIS era was military action in the middle ground - Germany, Italy - which gives the correct impression that the participants and their actions were much more intermingled than in the Virgin Queen era.
*******************************************************
Update: Rating massively increased. It works if players willing to accept that a lot of stuff runs somewhat abstract and euro-like, more than in HIS.

[b]Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598[/b]
2-6 players, best 6

Here I Stand or Virgin Queen? Or neither!

After reading reviews, maybe neither. Very complex rules, long, slow game play, and many patient/persistent players needed. I enjoy long and deep games, however, regrettably this particular game might just gather dust on the shelf, so I pass till I get to try it out first.

https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/19291791#19291791

from GMT website:
[i]
Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is a game of grand strategy for two to six players based on the military, political and religious conflicts within Europe during the reigns of Elizabeth I of England and Philip II of Spain. Each player controls one or more of the major powers that presided over European politics in that day. Spain is the juggernaut, able to draw upon the vast riches of their global empire. But such a dominant power is sure to have many enemies. The Ottoman expansion towards Spain's Mediterranean outposts remains unchecked. Elizabeth's English sea dogs are poised to raid Spain's overseas empire. And the forces of Protestant reform will soon drag Spain into eighty years of rebellion in the Netherlands. Will Spain find aid from its Catholic allies? Perhaps not from France, where the Catholic Valois dynasty is soon to engage another group of Protestant believers in the bloody French Wars of Religion. And even Philip's relatives in Vienna who rule the Holy Roman Empire may dabble in the Protestant faith instead of remaining loyal to their Catholic heritage and Spanish brethren.

The six powers in Virgin Queen are:
Ottoman
Spain
England
France
Holy Roman Empire
Protestants (Dutch & Huguenots)

Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is the sequel to Here I Stand, another card-driven game of grand strategy that covered the previous forty years (from Martin Luther's posting of his 95 Theses in 1517 through the abdication of Charles V in 1556). Players familiar with Here I Stand will find much that is familiar in Virgin Queen as over half of the rule book remains unchanged. New game systems have been put in place to emphasize the changing nature of the conflicts here in the late 16th Century: .... [/i]

Virgin Queen is an ok multiplayer (war)game. It fixes many of the issues I had with Here I Stand. Unfortunately our VQ sessions have not been satisfying. It seems that the games end too early because someone is lucky with dice. The problem is that one can get far too many points far too easily by supporting the artists and scientists. Did I mention the marriages? For some reason 'sue for peace' rule is now gone and that makes fighting and winning conflicts less interesting and almost futile. I guess I could play VQ again, but it is not a very good game. After high hopes VQ was a major disappointment. There, now I've said it.

Fantastic sequel and worthy successor to Here I Stand! I've had nothing but positive feedback when I got this incredible game on the table.

A nice historical period-feeling game in a big box.  Great flow of events can be capitalized on by proper card play.  The map gets a bit cluttered as the game progresses which we all know gives GMT the reason to issue a "Deluxe Map" down the road; so why not just include it in the initial release?  Overall a fine product that covers a pivotal period in time.  Fun playing.

Widely acclaimed sequel to Here I Stand with added artists, scientists, pirates, weddings and assassinations which greatly add to variety of ways to win the game. The Papacy has been downgraded to a minor power and the Habsburgs split to Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, the Protestants are now Dutch and Huguenot, but England, France and the Ottomans are roughly the same. I have won four of my nine online games in VQ, twice with Spain and once each with France and HRE, not bad with six players in each game.

It handles fewer than 6 players better than Here I Stand... but I'm not sure I will go out of my way to play this again. My biggest complaint is how the game ends. In Here I Stand you push and push to get to 25, or an auto win, and it's a simple story. Maybe one player is banking on some amazing die rolls in exploration or conquests. Whatever, it works great. In VQ, you play out a turn. Then everyone rolls a bunch of dice and maybe someone picked up 8 VP and now they win. Uhhhh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I prefer Virgin Queen over Here I Stand because of one of its main differences: The mini solitaire games individual players play in HIS (i.e. translating bibles and rolling for a male heir to the throne) feel more competitive. In addition, these alternative uses of command points (i.e. stuff to do that doesn't involve attack your opponents but instead give you a potential bonus) are more or less the same for all players -- so that there are less unique rules per faction, which means it's easier to learn.

Still, I'm not a fan of card driven war games, and Virgin Queen is not an exception. These kinds of games have a tendency to be bloated with chrome. Also, theme implementation is deceptive. Most players don't bother much with the event and play cards for their command points. And players don't bother to pay attention to what the event is, only what bonuses and modifiers the event cards give. Take away the cards, and these mini solitaire games, and you have a relatively bland war game. (This is probably my biggest gripe against card driven war games: they give you difficult decisions between fighting the war and these mini solitaire games. However, these mini solitaire games are boring.) One other issue I have with card driven war games is the additional luck it adds to the game. However, this is probably a good thing for VQ because this high amount of luck helps balance the game, especially for six players.

My initial impressions are very favourable: a world you can lose yourself in. Due to the complexity, playing time and need for several players, I haven't been able to explore (or experience) the nuances of the game. My rating may change once I've had a few proper group plays.

Unsure about VG.  On the one hand, I wanted to love this game as it is in the Strategic realm of Wargaming, but I don't think I will. The rules are beyond the upper bound of my tolerance, and though they are not complicated to understand, the shear number of them turns me off. There is simply too much to remember as the game changes from turn to turn.  Oh well, there are plenty of other good games out there!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Heavy strategy wargame game with lots of rules and reference needed due to the various game mechanics. Needs a lot of time to play with no mechanism to end game and hence could even get abit draggy. Seems to have some game elements (patronage and marriages) are simply added on to the game just for the sake of having more alternate ways for players to score victory points. 

Despite all, it retains a very epic feel when played and I love the heavy strategy nature, core game mechanics (CDG) and rich historical theme. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't know if I have this type of game in my any more. Nine hours reading rules, punching counters, and setting up the game. 10 hours of playing to get through half the game. About 30 per cent of that time spent stalled looking up procedures and cases that were often scattered over three locations. In a hopeless position three hours in due to bad rolls. The recognition that the game might be quite good with the same group of 5-6 players who have the rules memorized and have played at least a couple full games to learn the strategies and balancing considerations. Sorry, I just can't devote that much time and energy to one game, even if I could find the same group of players to also put in that time.

The follow-on masterpiece of Here I Stand, featuring the legendary era under Elizabeth I. It's a time when England and Spain biting each other's tail, when Protestant set their footholes on Netherland and France, when Ottoman started to fall and when culture and science continued to boom. Mechanically, Ed Beach succeeded to eliminate some key drawbacks of HIS - downtime for most players during the religious turn; fiddleness of counting spaces for religious struggle; easy sue for peace to nullify the war victor etc. VQ has more integrity and interaction than HIS, and equally highlighted in terms of history events!

Given the powers and situation, it should be better than Here I Stand--no religion yahtzee. On the other hand, there is a certain beauty to the heavy "intellectual" component of HiS, and, of course, being able to excommunicate people.

Too bad they changed the cover--I guess they wanted to be sure everyone knew there was a "war" component here...

I'm sure it's bloated. I'd consider playing this over a day with friends, but more likely and enjoyably, it will be a solo project or game kit on which I can re-play some historical situations.

I've come to the conclusion that like Here I Stand The Republic of Rome, etc you play these sweeping historical games because you're a fan of the history over the gameplay. If you enter the inevitably long gaming session with that frame of mind then you're going to enjoy being immersed in 16th Century history. If not, then you're effectively wasting your time and should look to play something else - for your sake and for the sake of the others at the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a great multi player game, and really lives up to being the sequel of Here I Stand.  The designer did a great job of adding elements to allow for less than 6 players.  Each nationality maintains the uniqueness created in HiS yet you don't feel like you are playing the same game with different cards.

The selling point for me is how each power has different paths to victory and the interaction of others is needed to both help and block those paths to victory.  History of the time period is sprinkled in very well which adds to the dynamic of each power and victory paths.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I am sure this will end up being a 10. But, just want to be sure the balance is right. 

Despite loving the heavy history theme, this game doesn't quite reach the amazing heights of its predecessor, Here I Stand. Why? Because there are so many elements that are out of your control - evil cards, dice rolls are even more important and the possibility of a sudden end (English Catholic Rebellion). Yes, Spain has to build up to the attempt, but a Spain that is on the back foot can get a lucky break from nothing!
After so many games I still havn't found the balance as good as HIS. Still love playing it though!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wonderful game. There are those games that give me goosebumps as I contemplate the history going on, games that actually prompt me to read the history books, and VQ is one such. Tough to play, in that you need a big time commitment and a good study of the rules, but I have to say it's well worth the effort. If you are even remotely interested in the theme, or history in general, and are prepared to commit the time, then you will enjoy VQ. Brilliant.

RATING: 9
Uses the [b]Napoleonic Wars[/b] / [b]Successors[/b] system. In this game it's important to keep an appropriate tension between Spain and the Ottomans, otherwise they'll overpower everyone else. England is portrayed as the nascent naval power it was until it's rise to supremacy in the 17th Century. France is in a strange position, having to ally with whomever required, marrying Protestants included, to avoid a land war within their borders. The New World isn't as profitable as one would expect, and even raiding Spanish shipping doesn't pay off.

This game exemplifies the concept of the balance of power, which had been Europe's dominant geopolitical strategy until the end of the First World War. Players really need to understand the geopolitics of the era to avoid making terrible mistakes.

I've only managed to get a tutorial game going, but already I can see the meat in this game.  It will be a wonderful feast when I can play the full game.  The only thing keeping it from being a 10 is the accessibility.  The rules are very complex, even the tutorial, which emits half the game, requires a lot of checking and learning.  It's not an approachable, or really teachable game.

Rating increased during/after online 6-player and face to face 4-player play. This is my favourite game of all time. It takes ages to set up and play, but that doesn't bother me. It's even better than Here I Stand thanks to the immediate fluidity and surprising number of options on offer (whereas the first few turns of Here I Stand were usually not that exciting).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Interesting game, but too too long and prone to wild swings of luck via cards and dice. You don't roll enough dice for the luck to necessarily even out over time, not to mention some die rolls are way, way more important than others and that could be when you hit your 5's and 6's, when you don't desperately need them.

A perfect example of "too long for what it is", about 2-3 hours worth of game drawn out into 10+ hours. And that's the SHORT game. Sheesh.

This feels like the better game versus Here I Stand but not all the time or under all circumstances.  I think the game might play best with 5 players, but I'm not sure.  Some other rules/victory points (Virginia Dare clones, multiple circumnavigation, the powerful observatory) bother me, but it's not too bad.  You just have to accept them and move on.  Playing multiple major and minor powers in a 4-player game seems rather confusing when you are still just learning the game.

Based on how much I enjoyed playing this (as Spain, who are the most involved nation based on our 1 6 player game) this was quite enjoyable. I was involved in just about every big battle, so was always active and interested in just about every part of the board. The diplomacy is interesting, though hardly novel.

However, if I'd been playing as the Ottomans I'd have hated this game - they were shut out of the Mediterranean pretty early on and so forced into land grabs across Eastern Europe where they stalemated against the HRE. As a consequence the Ottoman player very rarely had anything to do on the map and was scoring almost all of his points from patronising artists and scientists - a fun little mini game but entirely unsatisfactory for 9 hours of game play, plus 4 or 5 hours of rules and introductory scenarios.

The rules are such a hot mess that if I'd been the one to try and learn and teach them, I'd be rating this a 1. Whole sections of the rules are of no use - copied and pasted from Here I Stand and so directly contradict other rules in VQ. The player aids are cluttered and yet both incomplete (naval battles!) and incorrect (ours were littered with corrections).

There are also tons of look-ups for modifiers as everything has a handful of modifiers. I can't believe that there's anybody who has actually internalised all of these rules.

Apparently the designer has said VQ isn't a war game. Well, I think it might be, it certainly has the rulebook of one. It's unacceptably poor.

Essentially, that you can be all but eliminated pretty quickly on (with little more than some lousy luck) and then be required to play on for 8 or more hours is unacceptable. There's a few hours worth of fun here, in 8+ hours of game.

My rating is based on accessibility and fun vs. time taken.

Can't really say I've played the game when all we managed to play was 2 of the 7 rounds in 5 1/2 hours including going through the most important rules of the game before. This really is an "exception to the rules galore" game with special rules cancelling normal rules just about everywhere and anywhere. It's a behemoth of a game. Of course with this plethora of options you really feel like achieving (or losing) something one way or the other. It's rewarding and it's been quite some time since I last played a "Diplomacy"-kind of game. However 2 of the rounds were enough to spot that any other player number than 3 or 6 players is suboptimal. Controlling more major powers than any other player for any time of the game makes for situations in which the player controlling more than one major power can resolve conflicting interests clearly in his favor or profit from very stong advantages. Each major power should either have its independent plans (6 players) or each player should control the same amount of major powers (3 players). The rest works, but it doesn't feel quite right.

It would be a 7, but -1 point for down time and -1 point because a player can be forced to play for two hours knowing they already lost, and -1 for excessive chrome.

The historic period is fascinating for me and the german version might help to bring it to the table. The length might be a distractor, though. And in the end it was, so I traded it away.

A monster of a game. Lots of rules and lots of exceptions. Much that could have been better and a very long game where some players will be out of the running for hours while others mind their own business to victory. But also a fantastic experience where history unfolds in front of you on the table. Every time I play it I dream about it all night.

Don't expect a war game because it is not. Diplomacy, piracy, and supporting the arts and sciences will bring you glory. Not warfare.

Some of my gamer friends may be able to play once they finish their Doctorate degree programs.
The rules read like a Latin dictionary, but I see something special contained in this box, so I have hope.

Played only once, not sure if it's better or worse than Here I Stand. Certainly more complex. Should probably trade or sell since there's only one group I'd play it with and someone else who's part of it also owns a copy.

Charmé. Grand jeu stratégique: asymétries dans les stratégies et objectifs des joueurs (différentes factions), caractère historique (Renaissance), éducatif (événements, histoire), bonne profondeur (ouvertures, développements), jouabilité (6 factions à essayer et plusieurs avenue par faction), originalité des mécanismes (comme réduire les luttes religieuse en une mécanique souple basée sur des dés), sophistication (c'est complexe, mais pour refléter la politique et diplomatie de l'époque et servir la cause d'un bonne simulation historique), diplomatie, négociations (traités, ententes, mariages, échanges), revirements diplomatique (grâce au système de pointage qui fait qu'il faut éviter qu'un joueur s'échappe du groupe en terme de points de victoire), tension, gestion du risque (pas du hasard pur, mais un "rendement" sur sa préparation car celui qui prépare la guerre maintient la paix alors que celui qui prend toujours des chances finira par payer le prix du hasard et blâmer les dés). Ce jeu est tellement riche. Il demande de se concentrer sur une stratégie, d'appliquer les efforts à poursuive cette stratégie, mais aussi à valider la poursuite de cette stratégie selon les résultats (on ne joue pas, on gère!).

Excellent jeu piloter par des cartes qui allie guerre, développement et diplomatie. Une grande fresque historique qui enseigne et démontre la difficulté pour un dirigeant de l'époque de mener sa barque dans cette mer agitée de la fin des années 1500. Par contre, le jeu peut parfois se figer si tous les adversaires se campent sur leurs positions; et c'est tout à l'avantage de pays plus défensifs qui comptent sur un endormissement des belligérants pour marquer une victoire à la longue, à l'arrachée. Par contre, quand le feu prend, ça peut donner lieu à de bons revirements; contexte que le joueur du HRE appréciera pour monnayer ses mercenaires contre des concessions. Le jeu s'ouvre alors et peut donner n'importe quoi. Celui qui croyait triompher de ce chaos peut aussi s'écraser. Plus de possibilité que Here I Stand, son prédécesseur (début 1500).

This game confirms that the system started in [gameid=17392] is a really great way of simulating the fortunes and political interactions between European powers of this era.  This is a worthy follow-up, and maintains the uniqueness for each power, and cleans up several of the mechanics, notably the religious influence.  The feel, however, is wildly different.  VPs are not as scarce, and military is very difficult to pursue for even the large powers.  One piece I miss very much is the diplomatic wrangling, which despite the addition of marriage candidates to the diplomatic tableau, is changed for the worse.  Though you have more to barter with, the overall relationships are less open-ended, as your enemies and allies are pretty clear.  That said, it is a minor quibble, and although I don't hold this game in quite the esteem of its older brother, this is still one of the best multiplayer wargames out there.

Probably better than "Here I Stand", in production value (mounted board, thick counters) as well as in streamlined rules. However, I'm giving it the same rating because it is missing the freshness that its older sibling had. Still convinced that it is not worth to play if there isn't the full complement of 6 people around the table.

Increased the rating to reflect the same change in "Here I Stand".

I really thought I would like this game much more than I did.  I like the premise and subject, but the game was overly complex, and long, for what you get out of it.  The rulebook, which is a mess, did not help that either.  As a reference, it was awful, and it was poorly organized.  (Have somebody teach you, it would be much, much better)

It appears in the game that you have a lot of choices, but this is illusion and usually there is only one viable choice, and this trend seems to continue throughout the game with each power sort of funneled along a certain pathway.  Like many multi-player games, it becomes a gang up on the leader and you play circumstances rather than the game.

In the bright side, it is multi-player, has a lot of negotiation, diplomacy and back stabbing.  Could be a good game with he right group.  It just seems like some of the powers have little or no shot at a real win, and end up king-making.  I probably would not play this again, but I am glad I at least played it.  It had it's moments, that's the best I can say.

RATING: 6
Too high a luck factor. I like that there are numerous strategies that you can employ, and I wouldn't mind if some were more luck-dependent than others... but I hate that even when you want to play it "safe," there's no such thing. Whether you're patronizing scientists, circumnavigating the globe, engaging in piracy, sieging key cities, or anything, you'll still roll a pile of 1s at the wrong time and get boned. 

I find that an element of luck is most effective when it's up to the player whether or not to gamble. When you're constantly forced into it, it feels unfair.

Not half the game that Here I Stand is and that's taking into account some of the problems that Here I Stand has.

Prior to release I thought that Virgin Queen was going to be an absolute belter of a game. All of the new features (Diplomatic Marriages, Diplomatic Influence, Patronage, Espionage, etc.) and the changes to existing features (such as the Religious Struggle) convinced me that this was going to be Here I Stand, but better. Unfortunately, the (albeit minor) problems in that game haven't been fixed and the new - interesting sounding - features in Virgin Queen don't feel as though they're properly integrated into the game, or with each other. As an example, on our first play everyone was desperate to find out how the Diplomatic Marriages and Diplomatic Influence worked together, only to find out that they don't.

Part of my problem with Virgin Queen is undoubtedly that I had too high expectations of the game. I hoped it would be Here I Stand, but even better and, for me at least, it was Here I Stand, but with everything in that game that I didn't enjoy magnified.

Still, it's not the end of the world and I still have Here I Stand and many other 3+ player wargames to play and enjoy.

Rating based on a single game.  I found this game much harder to understand than Here I Am.  Not only were several of the mechanics not clear in the rulebook, the fact that critical rules and charts were scattered amongst the rule book, back of scenario book, and the player aid made it difficult to find the rule you were looking for since they were not well integrated and each often only had part of the rules.  

While I rated Here I Stand a 10, I can only give this one an 8.  It's not obvious that the added complexity and chrome results in a better game.  There is much less emphasis on the military in this game and the amount of effort to score victory point by the various options did not always seem balanced.  For example, France can get 3 VP from a good die roll in a marriage.

Wow! This is a monster of a game. I was lost in the rules and had a short time to go over them. Overall I really liked the game, but my lack of understanding of what was going on really limited my game play. I need to spend some time with the rules and other materials before I play again. Our game went 8 hours and we only played 4 out of 7 rounds.

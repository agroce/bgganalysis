Fine for a very light game.  I don't like that the luck of the tiles/cards drawn can either completely screw you or give someone else the perfect combination.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very light route-planning game that lasts 4 rounds.  Each round you collect route tokens, place those tokens, and use cards to move around the board, collecting your city markers.  The variant where you have to end the game in your "home" city adds a small amount of extra planning.  Plays 2, but needs at least 3 to work well.

Definitely one of my preferred games: it&#039;s not the most strategic, neither the funniest, or whatever, but it is very well balanced, easy to play and to explain, with some tactics and some luck (which I like, as long as it remains not too much), some interaction between players, and it lasts around 1.5 to 2 hours, which is exactly what I like. A must!

If you like 7 Wonders, you like this.  Same combo-finding, same complexity, same game length, same # of players (almost), same player interaction, same chance to lightly screw one or two other players at the table.  In this game, your undermining is immediately obvious however, and everyone usually enjoys that so this game gets the edge over 7 Wonders.

DoctorJ got me onto this game.  Played with the destination city rule.

RATING: 6
An oldie but goldie. It is one of the earlier boardgames so it's mechanics are quite simple. You have to collect as many cubes from the map as possible (each player has one cube/city). In order to do that you have to plant your trip by using different magical transportation methods (dragon, cloud, etc.). The problem is that once someone uses a transportation method for a road, the others are obliged to use the same one, so the game forces you to recalculate the optimum way to get as most cubes as possible. The rules are easy, but as it has no time limit, the planning phase can be long, too long.

With 2 players: To go over the rules. It has the potential to be better with more players. Prone to AP. With 5 players: Kinda chaotic and crazy, since planning is done on the fly and the travel tokens get placed. UPDATE: What saves this game from the trade pile: (1) extremely attractive fantasy map with pretty castles to examine, (2) SdJ winner. I like King of Elves better in terms of game play. 2015 UPDATE: Watched the Stikfamtion review and decided to keep this!

Now then...where were we?

Oh yes, Elfenland.  Great little game.  Plenty of route planning, a touch of "take that", a touch of bluffing, a little hand management, and some very attractive artwork.  One of my wife's favorite games.

Note:  We play by the "new" rules of drawing UP TO a hand of 8 cards each turn.  This makes the game a little tighter, with a perfect score quite rare.

Tentative rating based on one play.  Uses programmed moves remnicient of Robo Rally.  Where the game really gets interesting is when you start thinking beyond optimizing your move, and start thinking about about keeping others from optimizing their moves.  I think that one playing style for playing with kids, vs. another style when playing with my normal adult more competitive group.  Best with 4?

A játék a TTR előfutára, elég nagy a hasonlóság! Nem rossz, de itt sokkal nagyobb a szerencse szerepe (előfordulhat, hogy nem sikerül egy olyan lapkát sem szereznem, amilyen kártyám van, de olyan is lehet, hogy minden lapka stimmel... ez így leírva lehet hogy nem sokat mond, de elég annyi, hogy ha nem egyezik a kettő, akkor a többiek és a szerencse kezében vagyunk). Van azért némi tervezhetőség, de durván keresztbe lehet tenni egymásnak, akár véletlenül, akár direkt. A farönkös kieglapkák különösen gonoszak tudnak lenni:)
Az a gond a játékkal, hogy grafikája és nehézsége alapján könnyed családi játék (akár gyerekekkel is), de a gonoszkodás miatt meg mégsem az.

I liked the complexity of Elfenroads better, but that was too long. This is shorter, but doesn't have enough to drag me into it.

Update 4/15 -- With a 3 round ruleset, and "you may keep 4 cards between rounds, and draw 8 new ones" this is much more compelling, and I'm raising the rating to adjust.

I have played the game thrice now and I am not that enamored with the game.  I actually don't enjoy playing it.  For the amount of recalculating and recalculating you have to do but to be screwed because of not having the right cards just sucks.  Also the game is long for the amount of luck there is in the game.  There is quite a bit of AP going on because of what counters others place on the board makes you think there is a way out.  Sometimes you do, but most of the time you don't.  Will try the homeland variant next time and see if the game gets better.

If you make it past the detracting fantasy art on the box cover, you'll find that the actual game board is attractive.  Even though the game play isn't as smooth as Ticket to Ride, I prefer the long term planning that this entry-level game requires (must play with the Town card variant!)

Half the fun of Christmas or my birthday is seeing what games my family and friends get me, and then getting to spend my Christmas or birthday money on even more games.  This year (2008) I wanted to get some games that were more accessible to my young sons.  I decided that Elfenland might fit the bill.  I was not disappointed.  This has become our favorite light game to play and share with our friends.  Even my heavy-duty gaming buddies like to request this game.  It's great to strategize moves, but then of course, all my be for not if someone throws down an obstacle on you.  Turnabout is fair play, however, so let the gnashing of teeth begin.  Beautiful board and just plain fun to play.  Availability for 6 players is also a big bonus.  [Gift]

[i]Posted: 4/17/06, Rated: 6[/i]

I had read a lot about [i]Elfenland[/i] before I actually got around to playing it.  How it wasn't complete without [i][thing=158]Elfengold[/thing][/i].  I was still interested in playing the game that was awarded the [i][geekurl=/wiki/page/Spiel_des_Jahres]Spiel des Jahres[/geekurl][/i] (SdJ) in 1998.

The game is basically the "traveling salesman" problem: you have 20 cities to visit, and you must do so as efficiently as possible.  To turn this classic computer science exercise into a game, Alan Moon added cards, tiles, and of course, [i]opponents.[/i]

These factors introduce a high degree of luck into the game.  First, you are dealt cards.  Your cards will be used to pay for travel.  The type of travel you do is determined by tiles, which you will draw next.  You lay the tiles along the roads before you can move.  Some modes of transportation are better-suited for the varying terrain.  Unicorns can run quickly through the woods, but surprisingly they cannot run across open fields.  If you're lucky, you have the right cards, for the right tiles, that are efficient for the terrain over which you want to travel, and nobody else ruins your carefully laid plains.

Yeah, [i]right.[/i]

Obviously, the game is about doing the best you can with what you have, even when it falls far short of that ideal.  I enjoy this game more than [i][thing=110]Auf Achse[/thing][/i].  The theme is well done, and the pieces are of a high quality.  It can suffer from long downtimes in between turns, if people are constantly trying to recalculate their best routes after an opponent's tile has thwarted their original plans.  Maybe that skill will improve with practice, or maybe we should bring in a computer science major to streamline the process.

After one play I am impressed. The rules are easily absorbed and slowly the strategies become apparent. We played with 6 which I guess is the optimum with regard to squeeze on the routes, less and the challenge rapidly diminishes.

Second play 8 years later and I was extremely apprehensive that my glowing memories of this game would not have stood the test of time. There was nothing to worry about, this is still a very clever game with 2 of the 4 newcomers I introduced it to all wanting to by a copy. I still have just one criticism, what a dreadful theme. I'm sure the very childish backdrop to this must put some people off.

The game is quick enough and simple enough to be an enjoyable filler. Even if you have a bad turn or perhaps two, it's possible to come back as the scores are usually quite close. Think I would get bored if I played it too often.

I can see why this game could end up being a cherished game, and why it's something of a classic.  The board and illustrations are beautiful, the planning and travelling are fun, and the competition can be rough.  ;)  I never thought the travelling salesman problem could be fun, but fortunately I'm wrong in this case.

Have played only twice - once with four players, once with two players.  Two-player game was a bit dull due to neither player taking the same route, so ended up being 2-player solitaire.  Four-player game died for the same reason, but not sure why!  I'm sure this is a much better game than I think it is, but maybe I need to try it with six (though I'm not fond of games that require a high number players to play - or at least play with *fun*).

Edit:  Played again with three and it went much better this time, mostly because we all headed in the same direction.  Have upped score slightly accordingly but will need to play more to make sure.

Re-redit: DEFINITELY best with six.

I honestly don't think I have been more puzzled by a game than I am by this one. I have already played it a handful of times, and I'm still not certain whether I love it or hate it. I like the tactics required to plan out a good route, and maximize your cards and tiles. However there is so much analysis-paralysis, huge swings of luck based on the cards you receive, and big opportunities to destroy your opponents' game. I'm leaning towards liking it because I still find myself wanting to play, yet when playing it seems like every time someone gets aggravated. I often get frustrated with the amount of time it takes people to make a move. Some of my family members get annoyed when their entire turn is destroyed by a single obstacle, or by an opponent dropping the wrong travel type onto their planned path. Then there's those turns where you draw nothing but trolls and not a single troll tile shows up. Again, I get agitated when playing this game, but I think that's because it is so easy to create a plan, and so hard to adjust that plan once you've committed to it. I'm going to continue investigating this game, but I don't know if it will ever be a favorite simply because there are so many aspects that threaten to annoy the players.

Based on a single game session, I can say that I likes the game a lot. It is different than the King of Elves, in a way that other people's choices affect your journey more. We did have a 3 way tie, and then a 2 way tie counting the travel cards, and decided the troll car wins over the giant pig!

RATING: 6
You need to make it to the city in the mountains before nightfall.  

"I'll be damned if I miss Lady B's masquerade soiree again this year".  

You wisely sacrificed that Unicorn you were riding to a bloodthirsty Troglodyte that was hiding in a meadow.  Now, you sit around your campfire contemplating how you'll make it through the mountain pass.  

"Think dammit...if you didn't give away all your magic shrooms to that lascivious old raft captain you wouldn't be in the mess".  

SUDDENLY, as if a mirth beetle stung your left testicle, you're white hot and flushed with an idea!  You realize you're carrying 4 pounds of Elvish "Icky Arrow" Tobacco.  You take out two fist fulls of weed and toss them onto the fire.  A magical cloud, spurtles, burps and coughs it's way into existence.  It smells like burnt hair from a Troll's Taint.

"You going....UP maaaan?"  The cloud chortles with a throaty hoarse laugh.

With a cough and a smirk you gather your pack.  Then you quickly kick dirt onto the fire and float out the forest and up into the mountains.  You aren't going to miss Lady Belveder's Orgy after all you think...

Elfenland is a themeless game about the "salesman problem".  You're trying to be the most efficient person making it from town to town playing cards and laying out tokens.  The rules say you're all young elves that have to make this journey blah blah blah...I figured out that everyone is an Elvish drug dealer and you're slinging your rocks all across the land.  Being the resourceful lad that you are it's up to you to best hop about the realm and sell more goods than anyone else.

The game can be a brain burner when you're trying to figure out the cards to play and in what order.  Plus if someone wrecks your plans with an obstacle card you're going to flip.  

Fun game of dealing drugs, riding magical dragons, unicorns and other make believe stuff.  If you'd stop sampling your own product you'd realize you're just traveling by horse, hot air balloon and some grizzled dirty man pulling a cart for money.  Hooray.

I don't know why I love this game so much, but it almost always finds it way into the pile of games I put out as choices for a game night. I find that non-gamers like it, as well, though they do have trouble with the concept of traveling only where there are chits--even with a caravan--and only with that kind of transportation (even gamers have trouble with that one!). But as the first round progresses, everything becomes clear and a good time is had by all. Plays best with 4 or 5, though all numbers work if you really need a fix.

It's one of those games that plays well enough with 6 people, when so many other games don't, that it tends to get played ONLY at that number, because that's when people think to play it. Alhambra is the same that way.

My brain can't easily work with this combination of cards and tiles. The layout of the cards and the way the player aid is laid out, for some reason those trip me up and makes it more difficult for me than it should. The odd fantasy theme doesn't help either, because it doesn't help you remember what transportation works with what terrain. But if you blamed me instead of the game, I wouldn't disagree with you.

It's a good game, I enjoy playing it.

Very typical Alan R. Moon "travel-across-the-map-using-colored-cards"-style game. I like the opponent-blocking options of the game, but feel that long-term strategy is impossible because the board gets wiped after every round. Not sure how much better a player can get with repeated plays.

UPDATE: The spells and additional blocking tiles from the expansion only make this worse. You can spend ten minutes budgeting your gold, bid properly on the right movement tiles, and then lose your entire turn because of one "take that" move. Careful strategy + "take that" = bad game.

What is there about this game that people like? I just don't get it. I have a wonderful friend who is a 45 yr. old, 6'8" "kid" who looooves this game. But mainly because he can get an elf to ride a pig. This is just a boring, almost no choices, type game IMHO. I can see bringing some younger players into the hobby with this, but that's about it. (I have since given the game to my buddy who joyfully ran off with it. I hope it brings him many happy "piggy" hours of fun).

Must admit I thought this game was hugely overrated. I&#039;ve come around to it a bit more in recent years, but I&#039;m still not sold on it. It&#039;s decent fun, but drags horribly with more than 4, and the game is usually decided by who &quot;drafts&quot; the most effectively, somthing which is perhaps not random but certainly highly chaotic. Not bad as a lighter game, a la Mississippi Queen, but I actually think MQ is better. For the gamer, anyway, the Elfengold expansion helps a lot.

RATING: 4.8
Lot of luck involved with this one.  Gameplay was pretty boring and the game is constructed to be unnecessarily vicious.  One play from an opponent can take you from competing to the depths of last place.  And sometimes, it seems like these plays aren't intentional.  That's the problem.  People piggybacking, a fair strategy, can be hurt by somebody who has no intention of hurting them by playing unwanted tokens to routes that the player may assume helps the others, but has no idea either way.  Someone who goes off on their own has to keep a low profile.  If they are winning too early on, there are definitely reprisals, which are harsh, and really no fun.  I don't like games that don't allow you to excel, or if you do excel cause everybody else to target you to a certain extent (i.e. Settlers).  I don't like to play that way, but the game causes you to do it.  How does this constitute fun?

Only play Elfenland once.  After that, play with the Elfengold expansion.  The game is way too simple without the expansion.  My rating for the game would be a 4 without the expansion.

Cool game based on the Travelling Salesman problem.

I doubt adding the gold rules and bidding for tiles would make this the "best game of all time" that Elfenroads was hailed as by some when it first came out.  A lot of hype back then, when people said Die Macher was amazing (I got it and we tried it, it sucked).

This game reminded me of a path-oriented version of Robo Rally.  At the beginning of every round, each player receives cards that represent modes of transportation, and players take turns playing path tiles on the board that allow roads to be travelled with the corresponding types of transportation cards.  Players have to think about the movement options they have given their hand while putting down path tiles, and path tiles placed by other players may derail a plan to travel in a certain direction.

I like this game despite the randomness associated with the card and tile draws, but I would like to try it with house rules, or with the variant in which all the players must end the game on a city randomly assigned at the beginning.  The art on the cards and tiles didn't impress me, but the board (map of Elfenland) looks great.  This game has a chance of suffering from some major analysis paralysis though.

A beautiful game.  We play 2-player, it would probably be better with a couple more.  Although much of the time is spent setting up each round, you make most of your decisions during this point.  We play the variant which assigns each player a home town where he tries to end the game.  This makes the game more challenging and keeps it from being repetitive in further plays.

RATING: 7.8
It is hard to point out exactly why I like this game: I have to re-read the rules every single time I play to some extent, there is a bit more luck-of-the-draw involved than I usually care for, the interaction between players can be very limited indeed and the difference between final scores is usually remarkably small.

However, I love this game anyway! It has a non-violent theme and even if players hinder each other, it is not presented as sabotage but as an unfortunate coincidence, thematically. People can rarely get completely stuck, and in fact everyone can usually go about their own business with only minor setbacks. This makes the game perfect to conclude an evening of cutthroat gaming or whenever you are looking for a game that IS competitive but does not FEEL like it is. The lack of violence and the limited amount of hindering each other make this game very suitable for families and to teach children how to cope with minor setbacks in games - and maybe their lives too.

The main thing is that the game has a great feel-good factor: even when I lose, I do so with a smile. In the end, you never lose by too great a distance, which also adds SOME tension to the game.

Good to very good game if you want to put the effort to learn it, and even better if you play it with Elfengold. However, I don't think I will, because there are much better games that scratch the same (parasitic, routing, bidding, ...) itch. Solid 4p only game, but a bit dated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There is always room for a good gateway game in the collection.  These days, many are turning to Ticket to Ride.  I'd favor this slightly older game as being much more fun (to me).  Its very easy to teach, is not intimidating to the casual gamer, and has a fun theme.  The artwork lends it a light flavor.  It plays smoothly and in a fairly short amount of time.  If Ticket to Ride and Elfenland were going head to head...I'd give the Spiel des Jahres to Elfenland.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I own this game only really because it is required as a requisite for having Elfengold, which is incidentally, the game that I played first and which I have the most familiarity with. Elfenland is, by comparison, considerably less complex.

In a nutshell: players have a hand of cards that show forms of transportation and a small hand of tiles depicting the same. At the start of each round they put out the chits onto the board showing what cards are needed to move around, and then each player, in order, can do that, using the cards shown by the chit placement phase. The goal of the game is to visit as many cities as possible, and, if using the standard "goal city" variant, to end the game in your goal city, as being too far removed will lead to a significant scoring penalty.

In some ways Elfenland is an ur version of Ticket to Ride, but for my money it is mostly superior. The route planning and building is inherently much more interesting because of the nature of the cards having to mesh with the chits on the board, and the control that players wield in placing said chits.

The chits can also be a sticky wicket though, because the pool that you are selecting from is very limited, and if you can't get chits to go with your hand it can be hard to go where you want to. Of course, this is why I like Elfengold and vastly prefer it to this as in that game the chits are subject to auction. The downside of Gold is that it takes this out of gateway game territory, so it is harder to get to the table.

It is also worth stating that the game rules really need to be tweaked using "The Atlanta Variant" for the game to fully shine. Very simple: 3 rounds only, but you can hold up to 4 cards between rounds and draw 8 up to a max hand of 12. This gives you the same number of moves as the 4 round game, but is much less likely to result in ties, as the standard 4 round game makes max score ties very common.

A decent game, especially for kids.  You have to get to more areas than anyone else to win.  Sometimes the game can seem to take to long for the fun that is had.  The rating would be a 7 if playing with kids.(8-12)

I haven't played the game yet. The publisher of my edition is the Amigo. The quality of the game and the components is way under today's standards. The paper of the board and the tokens could have been much better and durable. Most of all, the game is really overpriced here in Hungary. I could have purchased either Airlines Europe or Ticket to Ride Europe too. :(

interesting game that requires some thinking when placing your movement chits based upon the cards in your hand.  majority of the game time occurs during this placement phase.  pretty cool when your opponents lay down the right pieces to ease your own journey.  though the box says it plays 2-6 players, don't think this would be a good 2-player (or maybe even 3-player) game...there wouldn't seem to be enough interaction to make it interesting.

RATING: 5
Elfenland is a human-solvable version of the classic Travelling Salesman Problem: creating the shortest itinerary between a given number of cities and an arbitrary constraint like for example shortest distance, avoidance of certain roads. In Elfenland, the players are young elves setting out to see as many of their homeland's cities as possible in the four rounds that this game takes to play; the constraints are the available means to travel on various roads. Of course you put up obstacles for other players so that their travel costs are altered to the point of not completing a particular leg of their journey. 

The subject is very friendly and carries over well. People I play it with almost universally agree to it being a nice game to play&mdash;which is, when you think about it, quite difficult to pull off. What I have against this title is that it simply isn't very exciting to play. You're solving a small optimisation puzzle which a computer would excel in; there is no room for a bit of creative play save hoping that more people travel along the same road as you yourself do. This allows you to travel further in a number of cases and thus puts you ahead of the city tour race. Nowadays I always play it with the variant which requires people to end at different cities in order to keep things at least a little bit interesting. That is, if I play at all. In conclusion: it's not a bad game, but I don't think it's very good either. Elfenland for me defines what I consider to be a '5'-type of game.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español** Yo lo juego sin los obstáculos de cada jugador ya que cambian bastante una partida dependiendo al jugador que le toque pasar por encima de uno o de varios.

Ganó el Spiel des Jahres del 1998. Efenland siempre ha sido uno de mis juegos favoritos sobre todo para 5 o 6 personas. Tras numerosos juegos Elfenland siempre ha sido un juego en que he deseado jugarlo todavía más y cuando no lo hacía lo echaba de menos.

Elfenland parece una especie de sencillo puzzle muy bonito en que la suerte también la vas a necesitar con un diseño muy simple pero grande. Apto para gente no jugadora.

What appears to be a simple game of route planning and set collection turns into a surprisingly cerebral exercise.  While the 2-player game really rewards planning ahead, with more players you're best to watch other players' movements and try to work off their routes.

The art is whimsical and the pieces are solid (although the round barrels can scatter easily).  On the whole a nice little game that makes a refreshing diversion.

I enjoy pathfinding and routebuilding; why don't I like this game more? Part of it may be the city with only one route in-and-out; it feels like too much of the game resolves around people dealing with that crux point. I think I'd personally prefer a map with more cities but no intrinsic dead ends.

Components: I love anything Doris Matthäus; this board is very handsome, as are the tiles and cards.

Experience: There was something missing for me. I was dealt a hand of cards, I chose my tiles, then placed my tiles, all in preparation for my trip; then I completed my trip, as it was planned. I feel the game is all setup and resolution, without a crucial middle to make it engaging. I did find it interesting to work out my path, given my hand of cards and the tiles available, but it was not enough to make me want to play again.

This is the first Eurogame that I researched and bought to start the game-store aspect of my boardgame collection.  I had considered getting El Grande instead, but didn't, and still haven't.  I believe that Rick and Jaylynne Fox bought a copy for themselves after having played with us.  I have a record of every game ever played on my board, likely about 100 of them; some day I will tabulate those records.  Jenn Munshaw still has the high score, 20+6 cards.  I believe my best score is 20+4 cards.
I found the rules for Elfenroads, which this game was based on, also by Aln R. Moon (who later had success with Ticket to Ride).  I had read that Elfenroads was a better game, but certainly not by those rules!  We don't play with obstacles - they detract from the fun of trying to get a good score.  Anyone who can score 20 has really accomplished something!
This is one of the few games that Annie plays.  The only time I play is with her and our various friends who also enjoy this game.  It's a travelling salesperson themed game, where you attempt to visit all 20 cities and then finish in a specific city.  A common variant we use is to start at different cities and have everyone finish at the same city - that variant plays very well.

This is a game of gorgeous art work and fun concepts. However, it is also a puzzle to be solved.

Hugely overrated.  A Travelling salesman problem, complicated by a huge player chaos factor that can make all your decisions pointless to the extreme. These are the same problems that plague games like Himalaya and Maharaja, so if you like those games, I'm sure you'll love this as well.

The streamlined Elfenroads cuts out the money aspect of the game, and simply concentrates on swift and economical movement.  Elves romp around the board laying down "travel" chits then spending cards to move across those chits.  Most cities visited after four turns wins.  Great game.

RATING: 7
This is an enjoyable game. The game is very simple, but the tactical decisions are more complex than I anticipated. Very puzzly, but not overwhelming. Unfortunately, it's not something my kids will be able to grasp anytime soon. 

The game does have some weaknesses. The biggest problem is that the obstacle cards are very powerful; luckily each person only gets one. An entire round (of only 4 total) can be total messed up by an opponent's placement of an obstacle card. On a lesser note, the cards you draw can be completely inefficient with what you are trying to do this round (so there's a lot of luck there), but that's not as bad because the main challenge of this game is to make the best out of what you've got (sometimes it's just easier than others).

A simple Moon design which feels a little dated to me.   You can see the lineage of TTR in it, and I appreciated it for that.   It is important to plan your travels as best you can - and that really is the heart of the game and the most satisfying element.    Might be something that I consider acquiring, but I don't see it as a game with a very long shelf life.

See how many cities your elf can visit in four rounds using various fantasy modes of transportation.  Well-designed game with a nice looking board. Forces you to plan ahead from turn one and deal with the luck of your draw. However, even with bad cards or a poorly placed path, there's nearly always a way to advance. Good game.

Kellett neki még egy játék, mire rájöttem, hogy egy jól játszható játékról van szó. Egyszerű, nem túl sok, könnyen érthető és megjegyezhető szabályok, kellemes hangulat.

Jó kis előre megtervezem merre megyek, majd a többiek lépésének hatására még vagy háromszor újra gondolom, mire egy ötödik variációs lehetőséget hajtok végre :) típusú, megfelelő interakcióval rendelkező, gyermekeknek is kedves témájú játék.

I've played this game many times and still really like it. You have to be flexible with your strategy in this game and some of my gaming friends refuse to play it ever again, because they don't like this aspect of it. The artwork and fantasy world is fun, but the theme is kind of silly just walking around the land picking up dudes. I think it needs a minimum of 4 to be interesting and gets really chaotic with 6, but still fun.

Egy "egyszerű" operációkutatás játék. Járd be az összes -vagy a lehető legtöbb pontot, miközben A-ból B-be mész. Persze azért csavarok és szerencse: adott lapokból dolgozhatunk, amihez vagy van vagy nincs közlekedési lapka. És persze az ellen is keresztbe tehet. Könnyű szabály, élvezhető játék menet, kellő mérvű gonoszkodási lehetőség -még ha akaratlanul is-, igazi családi játékként is használható. Azt hiszem igen megérdemelte az év játéka díjat anno. Ugyanakkor elég nagy a szerencse elem is benne, de ez nem befolyásolja a hangulatát.
A kiegje -elfengold- pedig egy komolyabb stratégiai játékot csinál belőle

2013-12-24 : Crapshoot game that takes way too long to play
2015-01-18 : Got a chance to take a good look at the deluxe edition over at the club - barely visible icons on the cards and a board that's simply too dark. Well, I guess they finally managed to bring the graphics in line with the crappy gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
UPDATE: Elfenland still holds to my "I knock another point off the rating every time I play" standard. I am finding this game to be way too random and annoying: random cards, luck of the draw on tiles, get hosed by being isolated on the map, get hosed by being with others that play different tiles on the routes, ugh.

----

Not my first choice of a game, but it has some interesting decisions in it -- the problem is that it's really easy to get hosed between the card draw and the drafting.

It is my textbook definition of a "well, if everyone else is playing it, I guess I'll play" game.

RATING: 8
Excellent racing game. The illustrations are top notch and it's great fun trying to outmanouevre your opponents. Quite a bit of luck involved (will other people play helpful transport tiles?) but a fair bit of skill too. Not one for control freaks or the analysis-paralysis prone though, you have to constantly re-evaluate your next placements in the light of what the other players do to make sure you end up with a viable route.

RATING: 4
This game in ways makes me think of reverse Ticket to Ride or Thurn and Taxis, in that you have to take your pieces off the board through the routes you create each round.  However I consider the previous two to be very much superior.  The best part of the game for me was the map of the game.

Old classic Euro working with The travelling salesman's dilemma. There's some interesting cooperative traveling elements and some antiquated, unnecessairy take that cards. It's got that late 90s Euro game presentation and its one of the better ones I've played. Through the course of the game you're given a minimal number of cards and 12 movement-enabling chits, so you must work with others to complete your goals.

Light, family game similar to Ticket to Ride - some strategy mixed in with a good dose of randomness. But I like it better than TtR in you get into the action straightaway. TtR can seem a little stagnant in parts when evryone decides to just draw cards.

RATING: 5
Moderately enjoyable, but there doesn't appear to be much strategy here because of the simplistic victory conditions.  You need to stick with the crowd, or you'll fall behind.  Clumping together gives the opportunity to screw your opponent, but the random elements prevent you from being able to do this with any confidence.  A mostly tactical game with a lot of luck is a hard sell in the end, and the less said about the theme the better.  I can't imagine playing this without the roadblocks, as they create one of the only really controllable interaction points.

Himalaya has a similar length and general mechanic but is far more interesting and fun.

RATING: 8
1998 SDJ winner.  A classic fantasy board game with lovely components, fairly light and suitable as a family game.  Requires careful planning of routes (and so can involve some brain-burning about optimizing your play), and has some player interaction, requiring you to constantly adjust your plan.  The obstacle (road-block) tokens add a somewhat vicious element, we've been playing without it for a more "friendly" game.  Gets tedious when played with more than four.  The ElfenGold expansion makes it more suitable for serious gamers.  

Designer had different rule than publisher: the original ruleset had only three rounds and that you didn't draw [i]back[/i] to eight cards, but just drew eight cards (you could keep a max of four). Worth trying?  
a) Draw to 8 simply encourages you to play every every card--including using the 3 card caravan rule, since you might as well, every card you don't use means one fewer card throughout the game
b) Draw 8 new cards each round encourages rarely ever playing any wasted cards until the final round--you'll get more next turn, since everyone gets 32 cards, no point in wasting them.
c) Hybrid: Draw 8 new card and discard down to 8.
Another suggestion: "The best rule is to discard to four, then draw eight. Hand max is 12. You can play four rounds, but almost everyone will have 20 points. Three rounds is just fine."

Ruben: "Light, cute fun. Excellent with 5-6 players."

Mel: I think it's a light theme that has more strategy than one would expect, and to me that's always cool. I agree with Ruben that it's one of the few non-card games that isn't ridiculously bogged down with 5-6 players, but actually plays better with more.

Looks like a nice light kid's game, but watch out... it can be a real brain burner.  You can see shades of Moon's later Ticket to Ride in this game, but the train game can be played with a comfortable level of concentration.  This one, though, is almost painful.  I suspect that a lot of kids would find this game dull.  (My 9 year old daughter liked it -- but she likes all games.  By 7 year old daughter played once, won, and then swore it off.)  After all, most of the game is not moving -- it is planning for moving!

RATING: 4
Note to self if I ever play this one again (from Variants forum):

[i]Shortening Elfenland from four rounds to three improves it significantly.

First I need to point out that we play the *original* Elfenland rules, under which each player gets 8 new cards each round (but you can't save more than 4 cards from the previous round.) Under the revised rules -- and the original rules were only in the first edition, so very few people are aware of them -- you merely *refill* your hand to 8 cards, so it's to your advantage to spend every card that can possibly do you any good. Under the original, preferred rules, you get to decide whether it's more to your advantage to save a particular card for the subsequent round. Thus there is a lot more interesting planning going on.

The reason we decided to try a game shortened to three rounds is that we were routinely finishing our games with several players tied, having visited all 20 cities... and the game was taking somewhat longer than we really wanted it to. With only three rounds, you are forced to make sensible decisions about which cities *not* to visit, and the winning score is usually in the 17 range.

A fairly good path laying game, players tend to go their own way, so it can lack interaction. Also has some negative, spoiling element. Try playing Konig der Elfen, the cut down card game version, first. ***  Played again. I'd forgotten the 5 tile open/blind draw mechanism that Alan Moon loves. I played better this time, followed others more, but I was still stuffed by having the wrong mix of cards and tokens. Came 4th out of 5, when I might have won. It mixes up nicely though and was fun enough. Might not win the SdJ these days.

Always fun.  I love the puzzle of finding the most efficient route.  It's refreshing to see a focus outside of building or bidding.

This has not aged well I think. TicketToRide is so much better if you want something semi light. If you want heavy then Airlines Europe is so much better.
I can see the start of something but the AP built into this is too much for what it should be.
And the player interaction is HEAVILY built on 'irritating as crap'. ;-)

Classic (and gorgeous!) light-middleweight euro that has aged very well. I only traded it away because I rarely have 4+ players to play 60+ minute games, and I got a good offer for it. I'm glad a friend owns it, so I'll still get to play it.

Rating history: 9...8.......

* Played 5+ times. Middleweight strategy. One of my earliest favorite games. So much fun trying to budget your travel cards, plan your route, piggy back on other players. Artwork is whimsical and very fairy-tale-ish. It is simpler than a game like Princes of Florence, but truly a great game. [Traded Capt'n Clever & Formula De Mini for this.]

JUN/13 - Brought this out for gamers who usually play Netrunner and Eclipse. We decided ahead of time to finish the game on 3 rounds. Everyone had a blast. This game has aged very well, and I can't believe it's been 5+ years since I play this. I will be playing it more often moving forward.

9th play: 8. (Sep/14) I taught it to a new group and they too love it. Every group I teach it to loves it. The classic middleweight euros have aged really well.

10th play: 8. The group I taught it to like it so much, one of them went out and bought their own copy.

[Route planning, point-to-point movement, fantasy theme] [6P:5, 5P:5] Elfenland is a decent gateway game for budding German gamers. It's less lucktastic than Die Siedler, it's less mechanical than Ticket to Ride, and it's definitely less boring than Carcassonne. However, it's an introduction into the gamer's delight called downtime. If you're a fan of games like Java or Tikal and want to get folks into those games, Elfenland is the game to test them on. A six-player game, which is the best way to play Elfenland, can stretch to 2.5 hours, more if played with newbies. Otherwise, it's an ok planning game. Remember to be nasty and block with the tile placements! Oh, and I'm very disppointed with the theme, which just doesn't work at all. See my review.

Viszonylag könnyed családi játék. Két bajom van vele. Mindkettő olyan, ami sajnos sok játéknál probléma:
1. A végén annyira közel van mindenki pontban, hogy szinte csak a mázli dönt. Egy-egy rosszul leosztott körrel (sok egyforma kártya), esélyed sincs a győzelemre.
2. egyfelől családi akar lenni, mivel elég nagy a szerencse szerepe meg a káosz, de közben meg kifejezettem kitolós. Ezt a kombinációt sose értettem. Már a kii nevet a végén óta rejtély, hogy ki a célcsoportja ezeknek a játékoknak.
+1. szerintem inkább 5-6 fővel működik. Négyen még kevesen vagyunk hozzá, hogy mindenki más irányokat vegyen, mert ha valaki leszakad a többiekről, akkor nincs sok esélye. Ez valószínűleg jobban kiegyenlítődik 5-6 főnél.

Érdekes, hogy ugyanaz a tervező gyakorlatilag ugyanazzal a játékkal (Elfenland, Ticket to ride) kétszer megnyerje az SDJ-t. Ráadásul szerintem egyik se jó...

RATING: 6
While the box says Elfenland supports up to 6 players the map gets very crowded when playing with more than 4. That wouldn't actually be a bad thing (causing more player interaction and all that) if only there was a way to properly manage that situation. As it stands, choices become severely limited especially towards the end of the game. With 3 or 4 the game is a bit more forgiving, but on the other hand also a bit less exciting at the same time. Then again, it's one of the relatively few titles that plays 6 which certainly is a bonus.
Hm, I'm torn. I really need to try the Elfengold expansion.

My kids loved this game (at ages 11 & 12) but I'm not crazy about it. The kids seem to be able to plan better than me. It also bugs me that the info is only on the upper right-hand corners of the cards so that, with my cards in my hand, I cannot see the info.

RATING: 5
Light game of route planning of young elves touring the cities of Elfenland.  You are dealt a hand of movement cards and then draft movement tiles that are laid on various routes across varying terrain for four rounds.   Using cards on the matching tiles allows more efficient movement. Definitely prefer the hometown option which requires you to end the game in a specific city that is randomly drawn as the beginning of the game as it adds some tactical variation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is actually a really good game! The player interaction is pretty high, theres's a surprising amount of thinking involved, but it plays very fast. I definitely prefer this to Ticket to Ride. Also, the theme is lovely as well! I'm not a big fan of fantasy games, but this has more of a fairy tale theme. I really liked to idea of being elves traveling with the wind, etc.

Simple, interesting game with an engaging theme.

RATING: 6
Elfenland gives a first impression that it is a good dose of luck, with multiplayer solitaire aspects throughout. Then, the game reveals itself to be one of those where you must do the best you can given the cards you are dealt and the Transportation counters that are available. It's an interesting balance between luck and control. Opportunities are also there for blocking players and having to decide whether to help yourself your hinder your opponent. A careful eye on what is happening is also key. Given that this has a rather childish theme, there is enough interesting tactical stuff.  However, the game might ultimately prove itself as not being that "fun" - so much so that there are just too many other games that I'd rather play before this one.

Acquired September 2006 

(As of November 2006) After only two plays of this game, I give it a very good rating. The rules are simple, but the play is challenging. In spite of the light theme, the game presents some complexity. As always in good Eurogames, the difficult part of playing is deciding how to make your best play from among many options available. Good plans are frequently thwarted by other players, either accidentally or on purpose.

May 2009 -- We still occasionally play this game and enjoy it each time. It is more fun than the title and box cover would indicate.

October 2011 -- This game still appeals to us. It is a bit chaotic, especially with more players, but it is fun.

2013-November:  I consider my rating to be valid, still, as we played this recently.

I think Elfenland is a great game - fairly light, but with enough going on to be fun. I have used it sucessfully as an intro game and also as a logical step-up in complexity from Ticket to Ride. Take out the log chits if you want to keep the conflict out and prevent leader crippling. It takes one round for layers to 'get' the interplay between cards, terrain and chits and then they're off. We have played this as a family game from about age 10.

From a theme standpoint, this game looks goofy and you maybe should think twice before you whip this baby out in front of mixed company in a public place.

This is an excellent route-building game and I look forward to playing it with the expansion to see how it plays.

Nice little game, rather luck-based but has an element of planning.

I play this mainly with family, where nobody really likes the heavier games. It's more fun than monopoly or risk; turns are semi-simultaneous and there's some nice anxiety in trying to guess where others are going to place their tiles. 
Figuring out the optimal route is another nice mechanic that sets it apart from traditional family games.

I played this game with 6 players. Maybe 1 player to many? Even so I loved it. Alan Moon is a much better designer that I thought. Is it better than King of The Elves? You decide. It leaves me with a slightly more complete feeling. However the card game is faster. Toss up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Beautiful game.  However, in its standard form it's way too easy and lacks non-obvious decisions.  In some games of Elfenland, multiple people will finish with a maximized score - and that seems silly.  The "fill to 8" card-drawing method isn't interesting because there's no incentive to save your cards. With the caravan rules, you can easily burn your extra cards and draw fresh ones for next turn. It's a non-decision. Similarly, the "draw 8" method is no good because it makes traveling *way* too easy.  The Elfengold expansion changes all of this, transforming Elfenland into a rewarding and non-trivial game.  Rating with the expansion = 9  [Note: Since writing this, I've learned that the Atlanta crew plays only three rounds instead of four.  I haven't tried it that way, but it might allay some of my concerns.  I'm bumping my rating up a point, anticipating that the three-round draw-8-more version will be more enjoyable for me. UPDATE: I've now tried the Atlanta rules twice, and they're the only way to play basic Elfenland.  Raised my rating two full points(!) to reflect the massive improvement in the game.  Three rounds is especially good for high player counts like 5-6.  Yes, even 6 works very well with the variant.]

Interesting game take on the traveling salesman problem, where you use a deck of cards to assign travel methods to various routes. You can assign efficient methods to speed travel up, or guess your opponent's route and assign an awful method to their next destination to slow them down.

Removing the blocking tiles and ban placing inappropriate transport on another players planned route removes interaction but stops the tears. The rule about taking one hidden tile does not add enough to the game for the additional complexity *UPDATE* Started playing again after about a years absence it is a good game my SO likes it.

This one is really fun. C'mon, you're an Elf!!! So grab a bike, grab a boat, grab a cloud or a goat and use your shoes to get you through the land, pick up your pieces and get home before anyone else does.

But wait, try to set up obstacles and make the roads for everyone else harder in the process. Now that's fun!

Really nice game, sort of like TtR, with the card play, but still different. Real gem in terms of theme too.

Juego ligero y familiar, tiene mecánicas que recuerdan al Aventureros al tren del mismo autor, pero este juego es un pasito mas en el nivel de dificultad.

Al principio puede parecer complejo pero tras una ronda todo el mundo ya anda planificando sin problemas sus movimientos en el tablero.

Juego muy llamativo y absorbente para no jugones y familias.

Tiene un lado negativo y es la cantidad de AP que provoca en todos los jugadores la planificación y replanificación de las rutas.

Hay una expansión que esta descatalogada y añade mas profundidad estratégica para los jugones, pero a mi no me llama nada porque el juego ya provoca suficiente AP.

El juego resulta muy divertido y es muy interactivo con otros jugadores siempre y cuando seas 4 o 5, con menos es un campo abierto sin competencia entre jugadores y con 5 y 6 puede ser un infierno de tiempos muertos

La mecánica es muy atrayente para no jugones y suele gustar.

Um...yuk.  Game that probably appeals to kids with a lot of luck (it seems to me).  Don't end your turn on the all desert space (our leader did this on the 3rd round and in the 4th round couldn't move his boot at all!)  Game ended in a 3 way draw with 4th place 1 point behind that.  Usually I love Moon games, but this one didn't really feel like him, nor did I enjoy it.

A fun race/logistics game with just enough luck and screwage to prevent things being too dry. We played with five and I think that with 2 or 3 it might not be quite as fun as there will be fewer options, but with 5 there was plenty going on and as a game it was really enjoyable.

RATING: 8
The components, the non-hostile player interaction (except for roadblocks), etc. all scream eurogame, while at the same time the heavy dose of luck allows even first time players to do quite well. As you play more and more, you may find yourselves with scores along the lines of 20, 20, 19, 19, 19, 18 in a 6-player game. The destination cards do something to alleviate this and the cards in hand tiebreaker is a good one, but this game can still end up feeling like a luckfest if everyone plays well.  Basically, there is a point where you can't continue to get better. There is no more creativity in your routes, just an optimal one. It is my understanding that the elfengold expansion fixes some of these problems, however, I have not played that expansion. If it does what it says, that could make this game truly great. Nevertheless, it gets an 8 because it is still a lot of fun. In my view, that is the most important feature of a game. As long as you realize that sometimes you may get bad hands and you will just lose and sometimes other people get good hands and win no matter what you do, you will be fine. The chance is what lets you draw new people in and then introduce them to something Euro but with more strategy.

RATING: 7.5
Surprisingly good game with a nice central mechanic of puzzly planning and route building. There's a bit of nastiness possible too, but it largely only manifests at the end (as early in the game it's often not worth spending time trying to hurt someone's position, as you don't know if they'll be ahead near the end). Definitely seems like it will be better with more players, as otherwise the map could be rather empty.

This is a delightful game, and pretty.  It can be played by the young, and older player alike so it is a great family game.  It has potential for Kabitzing, as well as "mess" your neighbor.  

The theme forces you to work with other players routes, change your plan mid-stream, and have a reasonable amount of cooperation.  It has player and game piece interraction, and a cute theme.

RATING: 8
An interesting take on the the "traveling salesman" problem, which involves path optimization, coupled with set-collection. Played with 2 players, which turned out to be multi-player solitaire, but with 6 players turned out to a knock-down drag-out fight to the end. Interesting that paths can be activated by travel tokens, which are blindly drawn from a pool, or from a row of five face-up tokens. It is cool to see how this would become the basis of Alan Moon's next design in Ticket to Ride. The optimization is how to best utilize the eight random travel cards that are dealt each of the four turns. Travel cards must match the travel tokens on the board, and number needed is dependent on terrain.

The board is gorgeous, straight out the graphical style of Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit. The theme somewhat holds together, albeit barely, but makes for memorable play. It should play in 60 minutes, but with 6 players, it took 2.5 hours. Perhaps because this was everyone's first game, or because there was a lot of socializing and talking, since the game seems to be solitary in nature when planning out travel paths. There is some interaction, where players can use other player's placed travel tokens, or players can block by making it harder, and more expensive to travel and collect specific markers to win the game.

Update (08/29/10) 2 plays: I think the sweet spot may be 3 or 4 players, as the 3P was quickly finished within a hour. Sometimes it helps to go along the same path as another player, using the travel tokens he/she places to your advantage. Other times, it can be a nuisance. It also depends on the luck of the draw of travel cards, the travel tokens that pop up, and the relative alignment of travel paths with the other players. Good, quick, thought-provoking fun, but stay away from 6 players.

If you want a game that can play 6 well, this will fit nicely. (And it works with less people too.)

You essentially want to visit as many different spots on the board using your cards to go from point A to point B. Each round players pseudo draft tiles and afterwards place those tiles on the different paths on the board. The tiles determine what card(s) is needed to traverse the path. If you don't have the card(s) needed, you can pay any 3 cards to take that path. There are many paths/ways to connect each location, so it becomes an interesting puzzle on how to maximize your movement. There is an added element that at the end of the game you will want to be in your "home" city (randomly dealt card at game start) or you lose a point for each space that you are away by.

A few tweaks to our gaming sessions:
1) The game is 4 rounds, but we only play 3 rounds; by then most players have been to most locations on the board so we just count up score then.
2) There is a variant where the "trouble tile" can be played on the board as a wild tile [or as a trouble tile]. Can be useful if you really wanted that dragon tile for the desert but wasn't able to obtain it; etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I've mostly played this game with 5 or 6 players, where AP can set in and lead to long down times.  It is a game of second guessing what your opponents will do, in order to take advantage of them or prevent them blocking you.

Can't tell how well it will go with fewer players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Notionally this is the Travelling Salesman problem done as a board game, but this implementation includes far more chaos than the famous computing exercise. You're completely at the mercy of luck in the cards that you're dealt (although the tile draw at least affords some element of choice) and you can be left relying on others to put the 'right' tiles on routes favourable to you. I don't really like the blocking tiles that introduce a nasty element into what's really a frivolous game, while the ultra-tight scoring means you can't take it seriously. Still, a highly original game that's fun once in a while.

A complicated point-to-point movement game. This game can be described as a complicated version of Ticket to Ride. In comparison with Ticket to Ride, Elfenland has more aggressive and competative mechanics than Ticket to Ride. Elfenlan is suitable for playing more than 4 players. The only weakness of this game is a little bit downtime with playing more than 4 players game, though.

RATING: 5.5
Ideal Players: 4-6

Description: A game based on the traveling salesman problem (with some added theme). Be the first to visit every city to win.

Pro: Variable movement costs make the game interesting. Planning is possible, but players can interfere with each other. Randomly drawing tiles out of a bag is fun. Based on a fundamentally interesting algorithmic problem.

Con: Theme pasted on interesting mechanics. Can be too much of a brain burner for some players.

Noone has ever scored a perfect score, and  I will happily play this when requested to.

This is a good little route planning game that suffers from some luck of the draw and chaos with 4 players or more. Less than 4 will most likely turn out to be quite non-interactive so I think maybe 3 or probably 4 best (some chaos is necessary for the interaction). 

The end in the city variant is a must to add a little strategy and challenge to the game. This will make another good gateway game that will still keep gamers in the crowd interested enough for an occasional play and will be a hit with the ladies. I can see why Elfengold will be more interesting and I will be trying it soon although I see the rating for that going to 7.5 most likely or 8 at most.

P.s - I love screwage but I think the screw you tile has no place in this game, at least not in this form as there is enough chaos and making your route 'work' is hard enough, it might be better off for Elfengold which I still need to find out. 

Update: 7 => 6  This game never hits the table, there are just much better choices and for route planning I would rather play Maharaja anyday

A great older game that shows its age a bit. I love the art and what the game is going for- move around efficiently to collect things. Each phase of the turn feels like 1998- they don't flow well, and they feel very clunky. Everything works really well, but it needs some streamlining to keep up with modern games.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (August 2011)

I honestly don’t remember much about the game. I have only played it once and it was a long time ago. I remember I liked it a lot at the time, but I liked all games I played on 2011, I was still a newbie and in shock at the amount of boardgames I was learning at the time :D. I also remember I thought the game had its fair share of luck.

I’m downgrading its rating to show my current desire to play it.

When and if I play it again I will come back to review my comment.

This lighthearted cutsie has a dark side.

Plan your routes, lay transportation tile on route segments, play the matching cards from your hand to travel on the segments (even if it was your opponent who laid the transportation mode tile). Somehow just the [i]idea[/i] of travelling the land riding pigs and dragonback makes this game feel young. And although the artwork isn't cutesie it isn't bleak or black either, so the young-ness sticks.

The dark side of the game? The main key to winning seems to be choosing precisely the best moment to play your one-per-game disaster tile to block your opponent's route.

This is one of our regular 2P games. We play with two obstacle tiles each.

RATING: 6
This feels very much in the school of Alan Moon's other connection building games. The board has 20 cities connected by roads through various terrain types. Every player puts a cube on every city. Each turn players draw a hand of 8 cards featuring methods of transportation and also draft 4 tiles featuring those same methods. Players ideally want tiles that match the cards in their hands. Players take turns placing tiles on roads that limit transportation over that road to that transportation method. When all players are done placing tiles, players see how many cities they can hit (and thus cubes they can collect) based on the roads they are able to travel over with their hand of cards. Whomever has collected the most cubes in his or her color by the end of the game wins.

Very simple game. I think the reason I like TtR more is that the tile draft feels a bit limiting here. If none of the tiles you need are available you can draw from the bag, but it's a little too much of a crap shoot and you don't have as much of an opportunity for making alternate plans as you do in TtR. The game pieces and artwork on the new Elfenroads edition is a bit too small and looking all the way across the large board to read these tiny tiles is a bit of a pain.

I look forward to trying this with Elfengold! I suspect I'll get more out of the game in that form.

Elfenland puts players in the shoes of teenage elves traveling their homeland as part of a rite of passage. How's that for unusual theme? Fun game, clunky pacing. The "get-ready, get-set, GO" structure of the game always bogs down with new players. It's as if you're yelling "GO! ok wait, STOP!, ok, now..., mmmhmmm, GO, no STOP."

The route planning can be fun but the game has a couple of rough edges and it always takes way longer than it should. This would go away with repeat play, but Elfenland has been a twice-a-year game for me. 

Update: played recently with my girlfriend and another couple who were playing for the second time, and it struck us that Elfenland just doesn't [i]work[/i]. It's got charm and little else. As something light-hearted - a pretext for chatting - it's fine I guess, but even then the game never gels.

I know that many people like the theme, but as a non-fan of fantasy themes, it's not only not my thing, but kind of ridiculous.  But I don't really care that much what the theme is, so it's not that important.  Elfenland is fairly simple to play and seems like it would improve with more aggressive and mean play.  I like the basic traveling salesman mechanism and I enjoy the puzzle aspect of constructing an optimum route.  But to take the game to the next level, it seems like you need to have opponents hindering you as much as possible.  So I will probably revisit this rating once I play with a group that all agrees on this principle.

This is a game for throwing out your plans.  You need a plan so you know which tiles to pick.  But every time someone puts down a tile, it changes everything and you need to replan your route.  So the final route you pick is actually the 5th or 10th plan.  I find that this gets tedious after a while.

RATING: 7
Ten years ago I would have said this was a great game.  Now it's either Ticket to Elfendland, 10 Days in Elfenland, Elfenland Pacific, or more depending on which Alan Moon game you've played where he recycled the exact same mechanics in a smoother package.  It's still a good game but he's taken the idea further.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A bit tiresome event. Lots of downtime during the drafting of the movement tiles as well as during the moving considering the depth of the game. The game is also hugely luck dependant. In order to do well you will of course have to have a good strategy, but most likely some lucky help from others is needed and card/movement tile balance may really screw you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light game that keeps you on your toes. Your strategy will constantly change, even if you try and go off on your own since others can still play tiles that'll ruin your perfect run. The luck of the draw (cards and tiles) does allow for some bluffing to occur as well. Since you can play off each players' tiles, a truly bad card hand is a bit more rare than in other card based boardgames.

RATING: 4
For whatever reason, this game just never seemed enjoyable to me. A recent play reminded me of why.

First off, it's hard enough to keep your eyes peeled well enough to make sure you get the chits that go with your cards.

It's harder still to also track the different lands you'll be going through to make sure your forms of transportation will go through, and whether they will cost you extra to do so.

So you have all this AP when drawing thr chits. Then you start laying them down and in the first round you lose the game because someone stuck some other chit on the route you had been planning. And you spend the rest of that round plus the next three just losing with nothing you can do about it.

In short, the game can take two hours to play, where you spend 20 minutes actually doing anything, and 100 minutes trapped in AP or watching other players trapped in AP.

Which would be bad enough, but since there's no actual fun in the game...

First played with Becca Barringer

Fun game, great theme and map with good tension, but always ends up pretty much the same, with maybe a few getting all their cities and everyone else a few off.  The hazard tiles never get played until the last round either in my experience.  All in all though, an underestimated game that has a lot to offer.

This is an excellent game, one of my favorites, with a nice board and an interesting core idea.  Definitely a game with a high "fun factor," but the theme was a just a tad too cute for me and I found the artwork components a bit hard to distinguish and confusing at times.  With six non-gamers it dragged a little as down-time was excessive.  However, more players would probably be better for gamers as it means more interaction and foiling of plans.

I thought this old-school ancestor of Ticket to Ride was just peachy when I played it two days ago for the first time (12/11/07), with the Home Cities variant.  Your goal is to travel around Elfenland, and by visiting each of the cities, you get more points.  With the Home Cities variant, you are dealt a secret hometown that you must return to at the end of the game, losing 1 point for every space away from your hometown you are.  There's definitely some luck in the cards dealt out, as well as in the chits that come up, but it's not enough that one cannot mitigate it to some extent.  At any rate, it is fun and relatively fast.  Probably best with 5, and would work for 4 well, too.  With six, it was a bit much.

Best with 4 to 6 players; an elegant route planning and interactive travel game.  When teaching casual/non-gamers perhaps better to take out the obstacles or home city goal).  My rating goes up significantly, to at least a solid "8", when you add the Elfengold expansion to this base game (which essentiall makes it more like the original, Elfenroads).  I generally prefer to eliminate the obstacles tiles in the game b/c it influences kingmaking circumstances...

I think it needs more players to shine, but that can slow things down too. Nearly a 7.

This game bores the hell out of me. It is a basic optimization game that seems to play itself as you must play chits that match the cards you have.

Further, the scores of the games I have played have all been really close. This is not a good thing because if everyone scores the same throughout the game what is the point? I don't know.

Traded.

Truly deserves the moniker of a classic.  My definition of a classic contains 5 parts; 1) A robust and engaging mechanism which provides opportunities for good play and looks poorly on bad play, 2) influential, its ideas are found in other games, 3) and most importantly a game that I am rubbish at but 4) though I am rubbish at the game I enjoyed every moment of gameplay and I am determined to improve.  Finally 5) longevity - a game that is remembered beyond the following Essen after its release is becoming more and more remarkable in this hobby but to be remembered and held high 20+ years after its release deserves a medal.  A true classic.

I like being an Elf, walking around the Elven country side! I like the original game board values as well (differences in how the shipping works across both lakes, for example - look it up here at BGG). However, I *do not* like the added complication of the Elfengold rules (auctions - uggh), thus making me perfectly happy to not own that expansion directly (using the cards from the card game for the expansion works well enough, though).
Great looking board!

Great game that I have found goes over well with gamers and non gamers alike.  I find it very entertaining when I can see every new players "lightbulb" moment when all the mechanics click and they "get" it.  I have yet to introduce this to anyone who didnt like it.

Interestingly enough, this is like my wife's "autistic game" or something.  In general she is not a very good gamer.  She tends to usually torpedo herself somehow or another.  But not in Elfenland.  She has some bizarre attunement to it.  At this point she is undefeated.

Elfenland is interesting. The theme, which involves teenage Elves traveling the countryside in a variety of elvish contraptions is quite camp. It's the sort of them that I can't imagine anyone would try nowadays, and yet it managed to win SdJ in its time. And rightly so, because Elfenland is exactly the right balance of lighthearted, a little bit of luck, and intelligent play that you'd expect from one of the more reputable SdJ titles.

There's not a lot of games that implement the Traveling Salesman problem in my collection, so this fits a nice niche.

This game is a blast. It seems very simple, especially in the first round, but with each round it gets more frustrating to try and plan your routes. The dynamic of having everyone choosing the type of transportation on each route is a great challenge - you are constantly having to adjust your plans as the round progresses. We haven't played the advanced variant yet, but it looks like it will add yet another (frustratingly fun) dimension to the game.

Simple traveling salesmen game where you have to find the best route through as many cities as possible, by playing cards and planning your routes as optimal as possible. 

The theme is very present in this game and hides the fact that this is actually a simple game.

Nevertheless, this is not a game that you want to play too often. For that, it's just a bit to hollow, to repetitive and to straightforward (boring). But once in a while, its ok.

RATING: 3
Too long, random, and tedious.  

It's almost impossible to plan your moves well and then actually execute them, as there is almost no way to compensate for something that messes you up and still have a chance against someone that didn't get foiled (usually just by luck).  

Random cards, semi-random tiles, and random "home" towns make for a dreadfully random experence.  

This game is also prone to analysis paralysis. 

I'd much rather just see who can roll higher with a six sided die. That would be just about as interesting, but it would allow me to play something else sooner.  

Nothing against the man, but this just reconfirmed that I don't care for Alan Moon's games much.  Sorry.

Wow, I was going to come back here and update my ratings and comments after a second play, but I don't need to, I already said everything I thought the second time through.  *sigh*

Oh Elfenland, how you draw in the unsuspecting players to your den.  You lay out endearing, quaint art, colorful cards, and bright tiles to catch the eyes of the unwary wanderer.  You shower those who wander into your lair with wooden cylinders and chunky Elf-Boots to keep them content.



Then you strike.


When the carnage is done, no friendships remain.


Remember, there can be only on Elfen-Lord, one who can bend the One Boot to their will, and they will not share power!







Fun, yet easily mean, game of traveling around the board.  Some randomness in card and tile draws, but we always play with max negotiation.  It doesn't end in smiles...

Lovely map. I like the game, but I can see how it might bog down with slow players. There is a contradiction between planning your moves and the chaos caused by other players.

Fun game with beautiful artwork. Players use different fantasy-themed modes of transportation to travel around the board through various types of terrain, each better suited for certain transportation types, as they attempt to visit as many cities as possible by game end.
Plays better with more people as chaos factor makes for more challenging/interesting decisions. Easy to teach and fun to play for everyone. We enjoy the game even more by playing with the variation, which adds an element of strategy and slightly deters players from simply "piggy-backing" the whole game. Biggest problem is that it has many pieces which are all cylindrical and roll ALL OVER THE PLACE if someone bumps the table (why in God's name did they make these things round!?!) Otherwise this is a beautiful addition to your game collection that will be good for introducing non-gamers into the gaming world.

A very beautiful looking game, very entertaining for 6 people (maybe one of the best games around for 6). The game mechanic is too simple and lacks an economic engine, that's why it doesn't get a 9.

RATING: 5
Not sure why this game is so popular? There is a LOT of luck in the hand you get dealt; if you get a bunch of clouds but need to travel through desert, though cookies for you. On top of that there is a LOT of downtime as players try to plan their paths, and then re-plan everything whenever an unexpected path tile is laid.

Very fun game with a cool theme. (Besides the dwarf who doesn't love elves?)  So far I've only played with two and although we tended to stay pretty close to each other pathwise it was still fairly strategic.  I can defintely see how a couple of extra players would change the complexity and options available.  I found the mechanics to be simple yet somehow refreshing.  
   Update:  I have played with four and it completely changes the game.  It was much more difficult to find an ideal path, especially when a couple of people were playing it for the first time.  I also noticed a bit too much lag time between turns.

The fanciful theme belies the possibilities in a large, aggressive group: play with 6 people turned into a pretty competitive environment!  People were slamming down barriers and difficult routes left and right, making the game that much the better!  Pure logistic game otherwise.  I would recommend this game for fans of similar logistics-based games (because of the added bonus that competitive play provides!).

I enjoyed my single play of Elfenland. It served six players rather well, involved interesting choices and dramatic twists, and moved fast enough. But there were moments that seemed too traumatic. Maybe we didn't plan solidly enough, foolishly allowing our best laid plans to be destroyed by a single well-placed obstacle. The final turn of the game was rough for most of us and led to surprising scores. I'd like to try it again with a little experience so I can see how possible it is to mitigate tragedy and plan successfully. I think it will be difficult to get it back to the table with my group, though.

Could never get this back to the table. Traded for Homesteaders in math trade May 2014.

The Alan Moon games I've tried have been very hit-and-miss for me. Some, like Union Pacific, I've found to be very good; others, like this overly hyped game, I find to be, well, kind of milquetoasty, too mild and bland. (I've read where this game can be played cutthroat, but that's a total mismatch for its cutesy look and theme.) Also, I never found a number of players sweet spot for Elfenland: two's clearly not enough; three or four--hmm, just okay. Six? The one game I played with six was dreadful. [8 plays; sold]

In Elfenland versuchen die Spieler, alle 18 Elfenstädte zu bereisen. Der eg führt allerdings durch unterschiedliches Gelände und der Weg ist lang und beschwerlich. Um einzelne Gebiete passieren zu können, benötigen die Spieler entsprechende Transportmittel, die durch Karten dargestellt werden. Einhorn, Drachen und Trollwagen stehen unter anderem zur Verfügung. Die Spieler müssen mit ihren Handkarten die bestmöglichste Route planen. Doch die Mitspieler können hier einen Strich durch die eigene Rechnung machen. Elfenland ist ein Klassiker und noch immer ein flottes Spiel mit leichten Regeln und etwas taktischer Tiefe. Man sollte immer einen Schritt voraus planen :-)

Play tiles on routes to be able to play cards to travel along those routes. The game is clever and there is plenty of opportunities to literally get into each others' way. Yet, Elfenland failed to engage me as the only thing you do is to optimize your own path, hoping that someone else by chance places the tiles you need.

Played at Game group. It went down quite well. What was interesting as I'd not made the connection before was that it's very much like Railroad Tycoon.

You are collecting your pieces from different cities and trying to travel effectively around the network.

Beautiful board and components.  I got this game at Gencon thinking that it would be a hit with my daughters (6 & 10 at the time).  It didn't really take, though.  And it didn't really take with me either even though I generally like theme-rich games.  There's just a little too much to keep track of, I found: taking things from this token pool or that, looking up the terrain that the various transports can cross.  Ticket to to ride is a more elegant rule set, and let's face it, if adults are around it's more acceptable to pull out a train-themed game than one about elves, dragons, unicorns, etc. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Be the first elf to travel to all your cities by using different transportation mechanisms (wind, water, mule, etc) by matching with your cards. Neat concept of using different transportation tokens over different terrain. However, one could easily get stuck with the wrong transportation token in the wrong area. Fun game, one tries to control their hands, but opponents can easily waylay a good plan. The first time I played it, I thought it had potential, but the placing of routes by other players seems to add too much randomness. I'll still play it since it is neat.

RATING: 6.5

The components are fine. I would have not chosen cylinders as markers, but they are not an issue unless somebody drops them.

The rules are very simple and the gameplay is as well, at least until you get to the part of placing the chits in the board. This is where the meat of the game really is and it's deceptively simple. Otherwise, luck with the cards and chits is very important, especially in the second half of the game.

It is a very fluid game and it doesn't suffer from high player counts. In fact, I think it works better with 6 players, because with less than that your options of movement are more limited and those who doesn't follow the pack will struggle.

It has aged well. My only issue with this game is the obstacle chits. They can have devastating effects and there's nothing you can do against them.

RATING: 8
Essentially about optimizing the use of your cards in order to visit as many cities as possible.

The facts that no card counting is needed and the movement tiles add an extra level of randomness, along with the cute and harmless fantasy theme make this more of a family game than a gamer's game. Lots of fun anyway.

The left-handed cards are cumbersome to use.

An odd combination of route-building, bluff and hand-management with a pretty naff theme on top. In 1998 it must have seemed revolutionary, and there's some lingering appeal today, but it'd be a long way from the SdJ on any modern list. It's interesting to see the genesis of Ticket To Ride, though.

Not entirely my cup of tea. There were three main things I didn't like about it. First it was overly long for the degree of challenge and excitement. Because the board changed quite a bit between turns it meant that players sometimes had to take quite a long time to do their turn. Second it seemed to have strong potential for the losers picking the winner by choosing which of the leading players to hamper. Thirdly it hardly has any player interaction. Ultimately all of these points count against it.

We had the card game, "King of the Evles" before we got this one. Real fun to play! We normally play more than one game, since the replay factor is so high.

Surprisingly good party game for non-gamers. The fantasy theme is very lighthearted, and that's nice for easing uptight non-gamers into the deep end of the pool. Who doesn't love an elf on a bike?

Actual play is a little dull for "serious" gamers but it's a good gateway game if you can find it. We play with the expansion, and it hardly adds any weight or difficulty to the game at all.

RATING: 7
This is fine as a light sort-out-the-best-route game, knowing that your result is going to be dependent on a) being able to share routes with others and b) matching tiles from the draft with your cards. The game is too processional with too little interaction between players on their actions to be a truly successful family game, and there's too much luck to be a successful gamer's game. None-the-less, it's enjoyable enough for the occasional play if you're not too wedded to the result.

A nice light game. Not many rules, but still a lot of thought. You simply have to get to each city on the board and end up as close to your home city as possible. The problem is, you need to use your cards to travel based on the tiles placed by you and others, so you need to ensure that you do not get stuck or have to revisit locations you have been in. Lots of fun.

I was excited to try this game because I love its theme. Although the moving system only SUCKS. The game SUCKS. I SUCK in this game (I think I came second in our four-player game, but it still felt so).

Ok, I'll probably have a replay after a couple of decades but while waiting for it, I'll spend my time with better games and remember how this one SUCKED.  

Ok, sorry about the number of those words ^^;;
Well, the art was kinda beautiful. Despite that, no more of this please...

A fun game that doesn't make it out as much as it used to, but I've always enjoyed it.  First of all, it's gorgeous, and although you may rely to some extent on the actions of others, in a multi-player game there is a huge need to be ready to adapt to given situations.  And it's fun.

I enjoy this but find there is too much scope of nasty plays of frustrating your opponents.

RATING: 9

This is a favorite game of mine, for some reason it has much appeal. I like the art, the nice big and colorful board, the theme, the whimsical tone, all the while it has some good strategy too. Another factor is the object of the game is refreshingly simple and direct and it is easy to see who is doing well and what needs to be done in terms of cities to visit to increase your score. Elfenland is definitely my favorite game by this designer, and in my opinion it easily trumps Ticket to ride and other similar connection games. Probably some people take a quick look and think it is a kids game but it actually has some meaningful strategy and is a heavier game I think than first meets the eye. A great game and somewhat under-rated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't particularily enjoy the card-counting element that plays into this game.  Overall, it's fun to plan and replan your routs.  It's amazing how badly things can go for you depending on how the other players play their cards and also depending on what tiles you draw. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Great game for 4-6.  Doesn't work well with 2 or 3 (but it's baby brother King of the Elves fills that niche).
Lots of decisions and some bluffing as players play precious chits to allow movement (for themselves and their opponents) and then use cards to travel the resulting paths.  Nice blend of cooperation and competition.

Love this game. I think it plays best with at least 4 players but we have had fun with 3 as well. It's fun to try and anticipate what the others might be planning to do and trying to plan your route only to get screwed by someone taking one of your spots. Then you have to make the best out of what you have and what others have now created for you with their own tiles they have laid. I like game that you have to adapt to everyone else throught the whole game. I have the old version of the game with art by Doris, it is great. Nothing bad to say about this game.

RATING: 4
Do not be fooled by the Spiel de Jahres award for this obsolete game - it MAY have been deserving in 1998, but it is not even near worthy of playing nowadays.

After an exhaustive 2nd play, this game is terrible.
All sorts of fiddly rules and mechanisms that destroy the basic premise of the game : it does NOT have family-friendly rules, or gameplay.
I've played with 3 and with 4 players, and highly doubt it would work well with 5 or 6 players, due to the design flaws:

* The dragon is too powerful compared to the other means of transportation. If one player doesn't get dragons, and the other does, it alone will decide the game.  That's not OK in a strategic game.
* Only 4 movement tiles is WAY too reliant on lucky draws to allow a player to reasonably complete many routes when there are 5 or 6 players.
* If only a few types of tile are available (say, only boars and winds come up in the tile-draw), it can destroy the game. There is no mechanism for removing a log-jam of 4 pig/boar tiles that sit there for 2 rounds. I think a house-rule to blow away the tile-draw and replace with 5 from the pile (like Ticket to Ride) may fix this problem.

These are on top of the rules and gameplay flaws which sabotage it for its intended function (a family-friendly gateway game) :

* The way-too-fiddly rules require a newbie to sit and grok the entire sequence of play BEFORE they can even begin choosing their first movement tile. This is way too big of barrier for entry to youngsters and non-gamers.
A gateway game and kid-friendly game should allow the player to sit down and start playing within 5 to 10 minutes (max!) of the rules and learn as they play.
* It is way too easy to sabotage a player's entire route. I mean, you basically have to try to [i]avoid[/i] blocking another player, since the only time you wouldn't destroy their route is if they are being extra safe (or sneaky/deceptive) and keeping redundant cards for each planned route, or if you are getting extremely lucky and pulling every route you need and have the cards to match, and you are playing all your good routes instead of placing a crappy one where your opponent is obviously going.
So it fails the conflict test for a family game - too much blocking (like Aladdin's Dragons in that regard - too contentious).

First impression:
Interesting combination of family-friendly fantasy theme, and a higher screwage factor than TtR, Thurn & Taxis, or Railroad Tycoon. It's too bad this "fantasy-themed Euro" (almost an oxymoron) wasn't made more "American", because the boot has to go, and you should be collecting treasures, or even those cool acrylic crystals instead of wood blocks. Could be better balanced, and I think the dragon is needlessly overpowered, but I want to play again to see.

You get up to 4 tiles and 8 cards in each of 4 rounds.  First you get the cards, then you choose the tiles from a very limited selection hoping to make them useful with your cards, then you (and everyone else) place your tiles trying to make them useful with the cards you have, then you try to make the best use of your cards based on where everyone put their tiles.  Although every step is an exercise in frustration due to having such limited choices, the game turns out to be a bit better than expected due to the way players can benefit from another's actions unexpectedly, and deliberately mess up another player's plans.  Still, at the end of the game, I remember the frustration of having so few choices available.  ("Would you like the troll, the troll, the hog, the hog, or the hog, or take a random tile?")
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My favourite once-every-six-months game. It does feel like a solitaire exercise because preventing other players from effective moves comes down to chance (do they have the right cards vs your tile?). A few more log tiles per player could solve it. I find it is far better just to focus on your own moves and generally forget about how other players are going. Is this a negative attribute? Turns are fast enough and there&#039;s little analysis paralysis, which could have been a problem with this type of game. Recommended for both kids and adults, but unsure of its lifespan.

Fun route planning game here.  While there is little player interaction, with only one log to mess with the opposition, you still have to rely on what your other players do quite a bit.  That interaction keeps things sort of tense.  The only drawbacks are (1) that the game can bog down a little with over thinking of turns and (2) the fantasy theme - which around here means it doesn't get brought out as often as I might like.

Nice family game with engaging art. Planning your route and on the fly adapting to means of transportion placed  by other players is a lot of fun. There is quite some luck with the cards drawn and you can really screw your opponents by either placing a obstacle or just a bad means of transportion (troll wagon ;)) in their way.

It gets more interesting with more players, but then the game tends to drag and you will face some downtime.

Great game.  I really want to play with the Elfen Gold.  Some times we play with variant rules so it plays a lot faster and easier.  We just lay all the road tiles down first so all the roads are set before the game starts.  It does take out some of the strategy but now the kids can play too.

Got in 2005

Just whose idea was it to cover the board in little long cylinders that roll all over the board at the slightest provocation? Cubes would be so much better. Anyway, this is an alright game, its simplistic but can be fun. I do play it without those annoying red tiles that are only there to add some player interaction that the game is just fine without.

One of my first Euros.  I still enjoy it, but it's really at its best with 4 players - more and the game starts to bog down, less and there just isn't enough interaction to make things interesting.  
When playing with adults, I like to teach it using an "alternate theme" (gameplay remains unchanged) - you are a "Typhoid Mary" elf, travelling from town to town, killing off other elves with your strain of virus.  The elf that kills the most of his own color wins.  A bit morbid, but then so am I...  I don't remember who taught me this variant, otherwise I'd give him (or her) credit!

 accessible Light Euro 

THe board here delights me on a childhood level, I feel like I can walk all of the places with my eyes, think about the adventures I could have in each place. Love the names, the theme. Sold once, when I was in a cleaning rage, happily bought the 2013 German edition again.

I loved the bidding and money, when I had elfengold, and happy with the new edition coming out (THough not about the board change! but I'm safe, with my old copy).

They're two different games, though. The bidding/money adds definite screwage, and some people don't even like the obstacle counters! I play Elfenland for a pleasant outing into the woods, with all end VP scores within a point or two, everyone delighted with themselves. Then bring out elfengold when I want to cripple a teenage elf's travel plans, and crush their expectations under my moneyed boot. 

I hope to always have a copy of this delightful yarn.

I like the mechanics of this game. It's a lot of fun to plot out your travel route, especially if you can cleverly exploit other people's route planning. But I find that the game isn't very challenging and everyone always gets nearly the maximum score. I've been told this is because we haven't been playing our obstacles correctly...

The travelling salesman problem is a great idea for a game, but the card / tile randomness is a bit too high for me. I'd prefer it if cards or tiles  were a standard package or were chosen at setup time. It's also painfully long for what it is. Maybe if the map had less nodes?

The good news is that it plays up to six. The bad news is that you're often at the whim of the cards, the theme is childish for an adult game, it lasts too long, those vying for the win are clear as the game nears the end, and I lose interest after a few turns.

Thurn and Taxis is a very similar points game that's been refined and improves upon this by separating the points scoring into sections rather than a continuous line.

According to an initiation rite, elves from all over a wonder region visit the most towns that they can.  The one who travels the most will win. This game is all about planning, taking advantage of your rival moves, trying to slow them down and avoiding to get used by them. A well deserved [i]Spiel des Jahres[/i], something that can't be said every year. The most players the better.

Visually stunning.  Creative and original.  Has a puzzle-ish feel to it, though it is by no means solvable.  There's a high level of player interaction as you'll always need to use your opponents' travel counters, and they'll need yours.  Really fun.

Elfenland -- Played several times; four-, five-, and six-player.

[i]Update 16 May 2009:[/i]  I just a read a negative review of Elfenland, and I found myself wanting to defend it.  Which says something in itself.

Several of my gaming crowd find this to be a reliable "go to" game when we want a relaxing, familiar experience.  Some people hear "relaxing" and think "uninvolving" (or worse, "boring").  That's not at all what I intend.  I mean that this is one of those games whose rules have been so thoroughly refined that we all know them well, so we don't need to re-read the instructions.  And we all know there's a tension in how the game will unfold, but it's a positive tension, an anticipation of discovery.

It's always fun to see whether you can make the tiles you've drawn work together with those the other players are placing.  After all, the game isn't about using only your own tiles.  It's about finding ways to make your tiles and your cards work with the tiles placed by others.  We always enjoy seeing whether a player can enter and leave the board's only dead-end on a single turn (and whether the rest of us can prevent them from doing so).  And it's always fun  to try to mislead the others as to which city is your secret home, while you're simultaneously trying to prevent anyone else from reaching their own homes (or at least from reaching the cities you [i]think[/i] are their secret homes).  

Plus it's quite fun to travel by Cloud, Dragon, and Elf-Cycle.  For some reason we call the Giant Pig the "Boar" and the Troll-Wagon has always been the "Little Old Man".  Years ago I misheard "Little Old Man" as "Liv Ullman" and now I can hardly call him anything else.

We usually leave out the obstacle tiles.  This game is relatively light, and for many in our group, nostalgic.  (It hearkens back to our early years of gaming.)  The obstacles introduce a nasty dashing-of-hopes that doesn't fit with how we prefer to relax in our well-traveled Elfenland.

Was not sure I was going to really like this game, I got it cheap in an auction. Seemed like a simple game maybe to simple for my tastes. Saw it won the Speil des Jahres and how much it would have cost brand new. I was making a huge deal here. The rules are simple and straight forward. Does not seem much to the game then we played it. You have to puzzle your moves when you need to grab for tiles and adjust when other players mess up your plans. A lot of groans and moans when you place a tile down because you just messed up their plans, causes lots of laughs. We loved the game from the start. I am shocked that this does not get as much press as ticket to ride. We loved this game as a family gateway game over ticket to ride any day.

Sure, it's inventive but ask yourself if it's also not just a little boring.  Especially if you play with calculating folks that sit around plotting their route over and over.

A TTR atyjának játéka, nem is nehéz ezt rajta felfedezni. A játékosok tokeneket szereznek úgy, mint a TTR-ben vagonokat, itt viszont csak egyet kell lehelyezni egy útra, ami azt jelöli majd, hogy ott mivel lehet közlekedni. Ehhez még szükségünk lesz adott számú ilyen lapra is, amiből 8-at kapunk véletlenszerűen. A tokenek lerakásával próbálunk olyan útfajtákat választani, amivel majd kártyáink segítségével tudunk haladni a térképen a városok között. A cél minél több városba eljutni. Természetesen ellenfeleinknek más útviszonyok lennének a jók így a játék első részében kialakított útfajtákon kell megtalálnunk a legtöbb helyre eljutó változatot. Kicsit erősnek éreztem már a mindenkinek a játék során egyszer felhasználható blokád tokenjét, amivel egy úton tudja megnehezíteni az átkelést, de ettől függetlenül elviselhető benne a konfliktus. Könnyed, egyszerű, családi játék, TTR nehézségű. Nem rossz.

When I first played this game I had a boring time.  Then I played with a different more cutthroat group and suddenly my rating has sky rocketed to a 9.  What a great game.  There is so much more to this than it seems.

This is certainly one of those UR games to modern Euro design that at times I forget just how good it is, then when going back to it remember just what a solid game it is.  Why people are playing Thurn & Taxis instead of just revisiting this is beyond me.  Perhaps because of just how vicious and vindictive the game makes you.

I recommend using the destination cities.

I really do love games that include some sort of route planning, it is almost impossible to fail me on those terms and beyond any logic explanation. In "Elfenland" that said planning comes along kind of unusual when the elves can ride dragons, pigs and clouds among other means of transportation. The twist is you need both, the token to declare what transport is valid on a path and the hand card to use it. When someone builds into your route, you have to adapt, reroute, have lucky cards or a stinky round. You play four rounds, who visited the most cities at the end wins.
Straightforward with low player interaction, yet I was very addicted to this for a while. Now I haven't played for some years and would love to give it a go on boardgamearena.com where I discovered it!
Great game for the right gamer, better with more players yet I do enjoy the solitary feel that comes with a 2 player game, too.

This is a weird game.  The artwork makes it look like a kids' game, the amount of thinking and planning makes it feel like a strategic gamers' game, but the actually game play is somewhat random and chaotic.  I do quite enjoy the fun and whimsical art and visual presentation, but the game play didn't do much for me.  There was the occasional interesting tactical decision to make, but I found it to be mostly abstract, uninteresting, and open to the whims of chance (despite a complete absence of dice in the game).  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5/10

RATING: 8.8
After years of play we still prefer the original rule of drawing eight fresh cards at the beginning of each round, saving no more than four.  This makes the hand management decisions much more interesting than simply drawing up to eight.  But it does give you more cards throughout the course, and eventually we decided to shorten the game from four rounds to three.  With these parameters (and a pleasantly quicker game) our typical winning scores are in the 17 range.

RATING: 7
[Amigo Spiele 1998 edition] {Fantasy Adventure; drafting; optimal 6p} {7 basic rules, 7 "home town" variant} Elfenland is a family game with an interesting theme (elves travel around the land). It is full of player interaction. Sometimes, players can role-play in this game. It's a game of tactical moves and it doesn't provide many strategies because the tokens are shuffled each round and players have little control for future moves. After the transportation tokens are placed, the choices in the game are somewhat limited. Gamers should purchase the Elfengold to make this game less luck driven and increase the depth of the game.

6p is the only way to play Elfenland to maximize player interaction and fun.  However, this would introduce a long down time if you have a slow player in the group.

The "home town" variant could be used to increase the strategic value and excitement of the game. Original Alan's rule (draw additional 8 cards instead up to 8 cards) can be used as well to let players have more planning; this somehow reduces the weight of the game and general players can master Elfenland better with this rule (bias to reaction to situation, rather than planning).

Played 10+ times. It's a fun light game.  I think it needs some tweaking.  I like to play only 3 rounds because then everyone doesn't get 20 cities.

tl;dr: more complex than one would expect

This is a family strategy game. But in fact it has more levels of things to keep in mind than one would expect. These days family strategy games have 1 or 2 things to think about. This game gives you cards. Then you have to draw tiles. Then you have to place the tiles, alternating with the other players. And in doing so, you have to puzzle the most efficient route combining the landscape, tile and your cards. That's quite complex for a game of this level. You can build a good plan, but there are many points of failure: you might not get the right cards, you might not get the right tiles, or the tiles might end up on the wrong types of landscapes. On top of that every player has a tile to increase the cost of one route during one round. That could be an other point of failure in your strategy.
So yeah, I enjoy the puzzle, but for a family game, this is quite though.
This is not on par with the games that these days fall into the same category of games (complexity wise) but it is a good game. Just don't underestimate the amount of mental gymnastics you need to play well and learn to live with the luck factor it has.

Mucha interactividad entre los jugadores, es un juego te obliga a pensar en cada actuación de los jugadores a pensar de nuevo tu ruta, a estar atento a las rutas y viajes de los otros jugadores. Es muy divertido.

Con 2 jugadores el juego se basa en una persecución o por el contrario cada uno va a su aire o una mezcla de estas dos, cuando se juega con más jugadores con 4 en adelante, el juego sólo tiene una estrategia: pensar en cada momento la forma de viajar más (y coger más cilindros), y sí, aquí es donde las trampas hacen más daño, y es cuando más se ven, con dos jugadores no ocurre lo mismo, suelen fastidiar un solo turno.

El reglamento es muy sencillo, la mecánica se coge enseguida, las imágenes son muy bonitas, los componente muy chulos.

En resumen, un gran juego para completar tu ludoteca.

Personally, because of length, I prefer Elfenland to the longer, though also fun, Elfenroads or Elfenland/Elfengold expanded game. Even then, as good as this game is, length keeps it from entering the upper echelon of games in my rankings. I rarely see it played in an hour as advertised on the box. Time factor aside, this one is a winner in all respects. Update: rating downgraded to 6, and placed on my trade pile. This was a very cool design in its day, but it feels a little clunky and dated now, a dozen later. I can't get people to play this anymore and rarely suggest it myself. I probably won't play Elfenland in the future, but I have a lot of fond memories of playtesting, playing and being so excited for my friend Alan when it won Spiel des Jahres.

Elfenland is a little heavy for a filler and a little light for a main course, which puts it in a difficult position for gamers not used to Giant Pigs, Flying Unicorns, and Troll Wagons.  It is plucky fun, but the luck that makes it so family-friendly also plays too much of a role for my tastes.  That said, I definitely prefer Elfenland to its big (little?) brother Ticket to Ride.

RATING: 5
I admit that I don't really know what I was expecting with [thing=10][/thing]. I read the rules, but couldn't truly predict or visualize how a full game of it would develop. And I was quite in love with the artwork, both from the cards and board. Thus, I ended up with a somewhat high expectation for [thing=10][/thing], and it didn't delivered.

[thing=10][/thing] is simple enough in its rules: there are 4 rounds, and after players draw to 8 cards at the start of each of them, players, in turn order, take transportation tokens - these are put in the roads in the board in order to determin what type of transportaion is available by that road that round. Some methods of transportation require more cards to be used in some types of terrain; and, also, some can't be used in some terrains. Therefore, with the tokens and the cards, players try to come up, on the fly, with the best possible route to pass by the cities and collect their markers (which are the points in the game). These are what people are trying to do while Lady Luck normally has other plans.

Luck is present, first, in the drawing of cards - this can already break most plans before they even start. Second, you had it in taking tokens - there are 5 open ones, but also the player can take one, at random, from the pool. Finally, there is the luck (or lack of) with the placement of transportation by the other players - sometimes one or more placed will help you greatly, while (more often), the types of transportation will seriously reduce your options of paths - it is possible to pay three cards of any type to use any sort of transportation, but this limits the options quite a bit.

And it is curious that, with the amount of random elements in the mechanics, that the game asks players to plan ahead, since, one a path is taken, it can be too costly to verge away from it. Therefore, every round players must do the best possible with what they get (from cards and tokens), while keeping an overall path. [thing=10][/thing] is almost all tatics, with little control (is possible to keep cards from one round to the other, and one transportation token).

In the end, I'm simply disappointed with [thing=10][/thing] - not exactly due to the game's fault, as it doesn't propose to be a deep and strategic game; it is a light affair, with a good amount of interaction and plenty of luck built in. And I'm not in the least against these sort of games - they make for a sizeable chunk of of my collection, by the way -, but I was wanting more from [thing=10][/thing]. Others and I got, many times, a feeling of powerlessness and frustration, mainly by not being able to acquire the proper transportation tokens - we knew what we wanted to do, but just couldn't do it. Yes, this is the challenge: adapt to the difficulties and advance as far as possible. I understand, still, the gameplay lacked a proper fun factor. In comparison [thing=10][/thing] left the impression of an worsened [thing=9209][/thing].

RATING: 5.5
This was pretty unpleasant.

You randomly get cards and, somewhat less randomly, draft chits with the same designations as the cards. Then in turn players put the chits on the roads on the board. Terrain on the board indicates which chits can go there, and the number of cards (matching the chit) needed to travel over the chit varies according to the chit type and the terrain. Goal is to visit the most cities.

I had the feeling that the game plays you. You're tasked with drafting the chits and planning an itinerary that synergizes with the cards you drew.

The player interaction is potentially interesting in that two players with a similar travel plan may lay down chits that make the other's job harder or easier. But this mostly seemed totally inadvertent and chaotic (unless one is simply leader-bashing by placing a chit that can't otherwise be used), because you don't know and can't easily guess what cards the other guy has.

This solos terribly because each player needs to be devising a plan of what chits to lay down and how one's cards are going to get spent, but you only get to commit one tiny step of your plan at a time (drafting and then placing chits), meaning it's likely you'll forget or mess up the plan of a given player position.

Learning the game is somewhat difficult due to the rather arbitrary-seeming marriage of terrain types to what chits they accept and what the card cost will then be. Why so complicated?

Not a bad game, but certainly not the best award winner around. Luck (drawing cards AND drawing the tiles to go with them) plays a significant role and often foils the best laid plans (which can easily lead to frustration). Otherwise, the game is nice but just not very exciting. However, I will raise the score on this game to an 8 when it is combined with its expansion (Elfengold). The expansion reduces the luck element and offers more interaction (i.e. ways to play nasty) between players (although at the cost of a considerably longer playing time). It was a crime that the original Elfenroads was split into the basegame and expansion in the first place. Love the (original and retained) artwork!

Can see where Moon and Ticket to Ride mechanism got its origins. I have owned this game for a while but never played it until after I owned and played TTR. The game is not unique, but with 5 players, it can get quite vicious. The blocking of routes has a really high negative impact on the game and can severely penalize a player. For that aspect, the game can be punishing. King making is also a definite possibility in this game since you can assess where a player is generally headed.

Not a bad game, will be willing to play it again with the right crowd but certainly not the best game around for its genre.

We took forever playing this game, but I still enjoyed it.  That jsut happens sometimes in this group.  Occasionally some games, like China Moon, become horribly painful experiances when that happens, but most of the time it means we're over thinking, but involved and basically enjoying the game.  I really lucked out in this game.  I spent most of the first two rounds getting less than most and ended up taking a totally different route than everyone else.  In the beginning the other players who were overlapping routes were as likely to help each other as hurt.  Towards the end they were more likely to mess each other up and not affect me because I was off somewhere else.  Ultimately, I think I came back and won because of that and because I got the cards and tiles I needed.  I think Luck will probably be a big factor in future plays as well, but we all enjoyed it, so there you go...

I like this game a great deal, although at first it seems like it will be a bit dull. Having to suddenly rethink your path is what the game is all about, although it gets more than a little chaotic with more than four, in my opinion. Rock solid.

Improves immensely with more players.  It's fine light fare that's a good way to get younger or inexperienced gamers into the hobby, mostly by virtue of its non-intimidating artwork.  I find the game as a whole to be both too long and too limiting.  The choices feel unnecessarily obfuscated for me.  I analyze, analyze, analyze, and then I choose to go with my gut instinct anyway, because I can't see any discernible advantage between any of my choices.

Very nice family-game. 

Try to visit as many places as possible in Elfenland. To do that there are many kind of transport. Each player gets cards with a kind of transport on it. But you can only play them if you have a tranpsorttoken that corresponds with the card. To get those, every player chooses 4 tokens (1 at a time). After that everyone lays down there 4 tokens but again 1 at a time. 

If you don't have the right card you can put 3 other cards. There is also 1 tile to block. 

The game is played in 4 rounds (like mentioned above).

I like this game, and somewhat regret having traded it away, although I'm unsure whether I'll buy it again. Every turn you have cards and chits at your disposal and must plan how to maximize the number of places you visit. The cards are spent to cross the different terrains but beforehand the chits are placed one at a time by different players to determine where the cards are most effective. This is a nice unique mechanic and one of Alan Moon's stronger designs. 

UPDATE: back in my collection, Elfenland is a true classic of board game design. Also one of the few non-filler games in my collection that accomodates 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind edition of the game Elfenroads. The game is set in the mythical world of the elves. A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over a short period of time. To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Pigs, Elfbikes, Magic Clouds,  Troll wagons, and Dragons. Each turn, each player gets a number of cards and a number of tokens, each matching forms of transportation. The players first then take turns placing transportation tokens on roads (thereby defining what form of transportation is the only one that can be used on that particular road this turn), and finally playing their cards trying to move according to the tokens on the road to collect as many cities each turn as possible. Players need both to try to make a usable token path for themselves, while trying to stop other players from getting where they want.

RATING: 5
This is a strange blend of a game.  You're supposed to be able to plan, but you have random cards, random tiles, and the chaos of other people possibly blocking your routes playing in to that planning.  It's too difficult to plan the long chain of events necessary to complete your actions, when most of the selection process is random, so I guess this is more a game of adapting than of planning.

A great, quick strategic game to play with the kids.  Simple but yet requires care to maximize your move.  You use methods of travel such as raft, cloud, dragon, etc across various terrains.  Victory is determined by the number of cities visited and your proximity to your random victory location.  My children have asked to replay this game many times.

I bought this game a long time ago when it won "Spiel des Jahres" (as I bought most of them on that merit alone at that time). It is a path optimization game which is apparently one of my favorite game types (who would have though ;)) with a really beautiful borad, easy ruleset and fantasy setting. The game is easy enough for even small children (>6y) to play but offers so much depth that you can play it over and over without it getting boring. There's a little luck involved, but not enough to prevent an experience player from winning - it just forces you to sometimes change strategy.

And the bits are great, except for the stupid cylinder decision...which in the end isn't a big deal, but how hard could it be?

Point-to-point movement game with a fantasy theme. Interesting drafting of tiles to pre-plan your route through the kingdoms.

I felt that Elfenland had just the right amount of long-term strategy, and just the right amount of short-term optimization for my tastes. I enjoyed playing with the destination cities as an added wrinkle, but felt the hazards were a bit overkill on targeting other players. You have to plan ahead just enough to end one turn in a position to give yourself several options to proceed on the following turn based on the card draw and available tiles -- but even with a poor draw, you can proceed, albeit it could cost you in the long run.

To be honest there is really not much to Elfenland.  You play what you are dealt with.  At worst you move as far as two spaces using most of your cards for caravan.  I found the "planning your move" stage to be fairly lame because unless you must take a specific form of transportation out from where you start the round at, why wouldn't you pass immediately to see if you can piggyback on someone else's token so you can save your own to travel farther.  Lite enough for non-gamers and children, but I fail to see the draw for the more experienced.

[thing=229]King of the Elves[/thing] has certain distinct similarities to Elfenland.  I prefer some of the aspects of [thing=229]King of the Elves[/thing], and others of Elfenland.  They're each good in their own way.  Remaining aware that you could get a horrid assortment of cards for a turn will help you remember to give yourself a buffer zone, so you aren't sunk if that occurs.  If, however, you get four sets of cards that are highly disagreeable with the board layout around you each turn, then you can just have a bad, unfun game of it.  Fortunately, I think the number of options you have in the travel network help mitigate such misfortunes.

Feels much more competitive than Ticket To Ride.  Not a good thing for my wife.

After 1 Play: Though people complain about this being too light I found plenty of strategy, and would like to play again.

Travel around the map by different methods using your travel cards. Seemed like a too easy game where all ended up with max points at first, but it's probably deeper than I thought.

Almost always willing to play this. A bit too chaotic with too many players and without the expansion but the sheer beauty of this game attracts me magically.

while the lack of the bidding element from Elfenraods (or Elfenland plus the Elfengold expansion) makes this game pretty wattered down for gamers, it is a great introductory route-planning game for families or non-gaming friends. besides the artwork and mechanics are some of the most classic in Euro-gaming.

I can't explain this game.  I rarely choose to pull it out, but whenever I do, I find myself enjoying the ride.  Just a simple game whose theme rises above the mechanic itself.  Also, a great game for "early-stage" gamers.

Love this game. This was my first "German" game to play, so I will always carry the bias that some have for Settlers Of Catan as their first.

fun quest and resource management.  My wife loves it, but hates the obstacles and backstabbing interaction parts.

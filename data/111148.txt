Tired old Yahtzee gets a Bohnanza re-theming.  Wurfel Bohnanza is actually quite well done, with dice in two varieties with different combinations of beans on them and some beans scarcer than others.  The aim is to make increasingly improbable combinations of beans as you progress up a card.  As in Bohnanza, there is the possibility to cash in your field at any time.

With two players the game moves along quickly.  However, with seven dice and the requirement to set aside just one with each roll, I can see the potential for down time to become an issue.  I don't buy the argument that you are constantly involved because you can use another player's sets to complete your own fields; you are still essentially a spectator.

Lovely dice game for small player counts. There are real decisions to be made thanks to two kinds of dice and the push your luck element of whether or not you're going to aim for finishing all three steps of a card on your turn.

[ESP] Me gustó mucho esta variante de dados de Bohnanza. Como todo juego de dados habrá bastante suerte involucrada pero creo que está bien concebido. Un poco de push your luck y el hecho de poder cobrar ordenes en el turno del contrincante es notable.
Lo recomiendo de todas formas ;o)

A nice little dice game.  It can be subject to the luck of the dice, but Dave always seem to win.  

It's a little long to be called a filler, but definitely  on the lighter side.  What makes it interesting is planning how to advance multiple steps at once.  I think that it makes a good social game.

Plays well with 5.

Barely related to Bohnanza in gameplay. This is an OK dice game (if slightly too complex for what is supposed to be a light filler) and the concept of everyone being able to score off the dice is a nice one. However, this would probably have disappeared without the name.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light and funny filler, Dice Bohnanza is so much better than the original card game: actually the shared dice rolls everyone may draw from help both keep downtime busy (thus seemingly shorter) and make the atmosphere lighter, with plenty of space for chitchat, jokes and quips on the rolls themselves. [i](April 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to keep half-point ratings to a minimum: thus, since Würfel Bohnanza isn’t one of those, I rounded down my rating from 7,5 to 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I’ll just chime in with my thoughts on the out of turn, player “involvement.” So, the big deal is that you have to watch the other players play, because you might accidentally score a row? The game is being praised for forcing me to track and check more info, where I have no control over the rolling or outcome? I guess hoping counts as involvement. Ugh. The rest of the game is a fine, well balanced “Roll 3 Times” game, if you are into that kind of thing. I normally am, but I think I have too many to play, at this point, so this iteration left me feeling kind of “meh.” 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Two plays. I like dice games and I like this one, but this feels like I have almost no control of the outcome, at least less so than other dice games I like.  But it's different, and I value that in a game these days.  Short, and light, and lots of table talk, all things that make this a solid little game for me.

On the face of it, I like the downtime-killing part of it, where you can progress on other people's turns if you are observant.  Digging deeper, though, it's not like you have any control of that aspect, so the downtime is still there, it's still a long time between turns where you can do things.  It just means that you can't do anything _else_ to help kill your downtime or you might miss something.  Bored waiting for your turn?  Can't strike up a conversation with your neighbour, can't glance at the restaurant TV, you might miss something -- almost certainly you won't, the odds of an opponent's roll helping you is low, but you have to pay close attention just to be sure.

Wow, what a surprise! This has officially joined Love Letter, Würfelwurst, and Piratenkapern as one of our go-to fillers.  It's light and totally luck-driven, but it engages everyone for every roll because players can complete their own cards on other people's turns. The end result is a game where every turn players cheer or boo according to how the dice fall. Laughs and table talk abound. As a fun filler, it doesn't get much better than this.

Actually a really good dice game.  Whereas many of the dice games lately have just been blatant cash grabs on a franchise, Wurfel Bohnanza is a well executed variant on the card game it is derived from.

The basics are very familiar.  You have a card that depicts some dice that you must match.  There are 6 "levels" per card, and you will earn coins for advancing levels up the card.  On your turn, you roll the dice, locking at least one die per roll, and continue re-rolling until you choose to stop or all dice are locked.  You then check the dice against your card, and level up until you hit a level that the dice don't satisfy.

The kicker is that other players may always use the dice that you just rolled.  Locked dice are off limits to your opponents, so the more dice you lock early, the less chance you'll match something for them on later rolls.  This rule means everyone is always interested in every roll, which is really great!  As a non-active player, you almost feel like you're playing slots, cheering for that jackpot roll to hit!  You actually end up hitting on other player's turns quite frequently as well.  I'm not sure about one of the low rater's comments that it doesn't happen often... many of the levels have a 25% shot of hitting on any given roll.

In fact, each level has the odds of hitting it printed right on the card.  The lower levels are higher odds, and then it gets tougher and tougher as your progress through a card. So, based on where you're at in the progression, sometimes it makes sense to cash in your card for only 1 gold on your turn so you can start over on a new one, increasing the odds of the other players helping you out before your next turn.  The whole mechanic introduces some really interesting decisions.

When you level up a card far enough, you can cash it in for coins and start on a new card.  The game continues until one player gets 13 coins.

Overall, just an extremely well crafted game considering all of the statistical analysis that had to go into the planning of the dice and the cards.  Add in the really cool mechanism where you always have to pay attention to every die roll, and you've got a winner!

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 2 players:

Clever quick & portable dice game. Even in his light games, Uwe really shows his mathematical design chops.

The rules are simple but there's some nice chewy decisions surrounding when to cash in and start a new field. At first, I thought the bit where players can use each other's rolls to complete orders was going to function as a minor deterrent for the current player to keep re-rolling. It really isn't. Instead it's more to keep the other players engaged and thinking about when to start new fields - it's a nice little wrinkle that makes it stand out from basically everything else in the "dice" genre.

The dice themselves showcase some pretty poor graphic design decisions though. The yellow bean is just an eyesore - you can't even really see the art, and the fact that the two different colored dice are *so similar* seems like a huge oversight. It's not a huge deal but it's kind of unbelievable that it got through production like that.

I suspect people who aren't a fan of drier games won't really enjoy this - it's fun but in a relaxing sort of way. I would not call this game emotionally engaging.

Really surprised this isn't out in the US.

This game was BAD and my rating of 4 is perhaps slightly too high (the next game will tell)! I like Bohnanza, but this game didn’t remind me about the original Bohnanza game at all; it’s just a spin-off with a Bohnanza-name in order to sell better… The truth is that the game is quite terrible. I guess it’s a good game for non-gamers who like games like Yahtzee and such, but personally I want a game with actual decisions! There are almost no decisions to be made in this game except when to reroll the dice and which one to do so as they have different sides. This happens to be the entire game... Of course you need to calculate a little and push your luck, but in all honesty the game doesn’t offer interesting decisions.

I guess I do like that each player is involved on other players’ turns because you can still complete orders when it’s not your turn. However, it kind of felt wrong when I won on one of the other player’s turn simply because he luckily rolled the dice I needed… I would have won anyway though as I had a big lead – and this certainly wasn’t because I had played extremely well, but because I had rolled well. One of the other players rolled horribly and had no chance of winning; that’s not my idea of a good game. Yes, it is a filler, but a filler doesn’t need to be this boring and luck based!

Instantly LOVED this game after the first roll of the dice.  Features minimal required "analysis" (not a thinking man's game), but just enough to make it interesting while maintaining a satisfying quickness to the game.  I especially favour the mechanic whereby one can advance on other players' turns (thus holding one's active interest in the gameplay throughout), but when it's one's own turn to roll the dice, one enjoys a significant advantage.

Since I played the played the game only with two players, my rating might change once I have the chance to try it again with more. As it stands now, I'm feeling rather lukewarm towards Würfel Bohnanza. It is a nice idea that you can use the other players rolls to finish some of your own combinations. This mechanic certainly helps with downtime and keeps players involved. It does even introduce some decision making into the game as it is sometimes better to cash in a card early and let the other player help you with the next card.

What I was really missing was some kind of excitement. Würfel Bohnanza reminded me of a slot machine in which I have some control over the combinations which will score for me. In my opinion, the game is missing some kind of push-your-luck element that keeps your turns interesting.

Lots of complaints about the cream vs white dice, and I can see that.   But, I like how you can try to score things on each player's turn, while the rolling player gets a distinct advantage.   Also liked how you can decide how far to push each card before scoring it.   It's not a landmark game like Bohnanza itself, but this could be a fun filler to own.

RATING: N/A
There are so many things I dislike about this game. I felt nothing intuitive about this game. The orders that you need to achieve on your order cards are either too easy or too hard. I don't see the reason why would you want to hold onto a card and aim for the higher goals. Just reach that one buck level and then cash it in for a new card.

The problem with how the tan dice looks so close to the white dice is another problem I'm having. It's a complete disaster especially playing under the wrong lighting. 

I know that they promote this game with low downtime because you get to take your turn during your opponent's play but this somehow feel so dud that it bores me to death. 

I tried to hold onto my copy and try it with different group/friends just in case my judgement change, but I still don't really like it.

Bought this game solely on the good comments found on BGG. That was a huge mistake! I just don't see why people like playing this game. I love light and casual game but this one just a complete bust. 

Only plus thing is it comes in a small box, which I like.

2017-07-18 : first play and I'm not getting why this game gets some favorable comments in here. There's not much of a game here as the decision space is close to zero with almost in every instance there being a mathematically correct way to proceed turning this into a time-wasting activity/puzzle and not a game. I think they realized what a clunker this was and added the watch-what-your-opponent-is-rolling mechanic in there to keep everyone from falling asleep. That unfortunately also ensured that I "won" because somebody else accidentally rolled what I needed. Very satisfying that - NOT. The final nail in its coffin is that I can appreciate a 10-minute zero-brains-required filler, but not the 45-minute slog this game is.

I can see that the game might work for some players, with a mixture of luck and meaningful decisions, as is appropriate in a dice game, but it didn't make me want to buy it or even play it again.

You know what really irritates me?  People talk about the fact that you get to participate on other people's turns as a plus.  But you have no decisions to make on other people's turns; all you do is watch to see whether something helps you.  I hate games with no decisions, so how does introducing a phase during which I need to pay attention, but don't get to make decisions, count as a benefit?  The nice thing about being dummy at bridge is that you can go get some snacks if you want!

Perhaps one needs to enjoy rolling dice as an activity in itself to really like this game.  For some reason, this game particularly irritates me, and as a result I rate it lower than it probably should be rated from a purely objective standpoint.

And you could expect from the creator of Agricola a dice game that would offer something more than just rerolling. Yes - there is a nice twist in form of two sets of different dice but gambling on probabilities gets boring very quickly because you HAVE to collect certain sets of symbols in a specific order and you CAN'T influence your rolls.

A big dissapointment.

Yahtzee pimped with a Bohnanza theme - actually works OK, you stay involved in others' turns as you check whether you can score or if it is worth cashing in your existing card to the new cards.  Hasn't got the excitement of Vegas, and I'd prefer the decision-making in Wurfel Zooloretto.

I'm impressed with the design of this game, but I'm not sure how much I actually enjoy playing it.

The physical production of the game could have been better. There are white-colored dice and cream-colored dice, and it's important to be able to quickly differentiate between them. I think the publisher wanted to make it easy to quickly scan the symbols on the die faces, but the tradeoff is that it's much too hard to tell the white dice from the cream dice.

Update: Played it a few more times with a mixed-age group. The 9-year-old absolutely loved it, and was able to play capably. She played the game repeatedly throughout the gaming weekend. I still think it's a smart design, and I still think I'm only mildly amused by it.

Roll the dice to fulfill orders for beans but watch out! There's a chance the opponent might score during your turn. After you completed a few sequences you can choose to sell your card or try to complete more orders to make it more profitable.
Unfortunately the two types of dice have very similar colors, but luckily the player aids show you the faces for both dice.

A nice little game that could be called a filler but is popular enough with the family that we would be able to get multiple plays in a single gaming session when we don't feel like playing something heavier.

Price point of $10 US was nice as well. The only downside is that I had to wait awhile before my FLGS (Time Well Spent games) had it in stock.

Excellent dice game using the Bohnanza theme.  The core mechanism works similar to [thing=2578][/thing] (only much better): You roll 7 dice, trying to get certain combinations. The new (and exciting) twist in this game is, that players may complete their combiantions on other players turns.  This adds addition tension and interaction because you need to constantly watch the rolls of other players. Sometimes it is even possible deliberately adapt your required combinations with those of other players which improves your odds siginificantly.

This fine game shows that Uwe Rosenberg is a really brilliant game designer.  Personally, I'm a pretty tired of his math-heavy hard-core games like Loyang or Le Havre but Würfel Bohnanza shows that he hasn't unlearnt to design casual games.  Highly recommended!

The idea of caring what other people do on their turn is great. But you don't have any control, so all you get to do is try to look at colours really quickly. A good insight which wasn't capitalised on properly.

RATING: 6
It's a dice game in which you must throw dice to achieve combinations, thus very close to some classics; the originality is that you must stay alert to the combinations others are rolling, but there is no interaction whatsover.
I'd rather play Keltis dice because it's shorter and there is a risk taking element that is much more subdued in Bohnanza.

Bohnanza: The Dice game is, in my opinion, a pale comparison of the card game. While it is mechanically sound, it doesn't do anything new: the roll and put at least one aside is nothing that hasn't been done over and over again. Worse, the two things that really put Bohnanza on the map are removed: both the innovative "don't re-arrange your hand" constraint and, more importantly, the negotiation aspect that makes Bohnanza a riotous, rich, and interactive game. The only thing that keeps players engaged when not their turn is that it is possible that another player 'scores' the combination you are working towards (which is a HUGE improvement on other "the dice game" variations of other games; e.g., Roll Through the Ages).

Ugh. Extremely ugly dice with hard-to-distinguish colors for a game which requires fast reaction sometimes - not so good. The game itself is a typical modern dice rolling game: Lots of bureaucracy and/or thinking, and in the end you are just rolling dice. Dice games are simply not for me, I guess. I love Bohnanza, but this doesn't feel like Bohnanza in the slightest.

Wurfel Bohananza is probably the best dice version of a game I've played so far.  While it doesn't surpass Bohananza, it's got a great feel to it that is comparable to the card game.  I love how on each turn all players are involved, checking to see if they're able to finish a needed combo.  Just a really wonderful game that works so well in the Bohnanza world.

RATING: 4
A Yahtzee-inspired dice game of rolling specific combinations. The odd thing is that it's possible to make half of your points with the rolls of other players, no decision involved in that case. Dice and cards together are one random factor too much. Given the slew of other better Yahtzee-inspired games, this is superfluous even as a filler game.

RATING: 7
The big problem with this game is that it simply lacks excitement. While the selling point of the game is that you can be involved on other players' turns, in practice it is annoying, since the other player is always moving the dice around to suit their needs, and you might not always have time to properly view what they rolled before they're ready to roll again. Like its parent game, it also lasts too long.

The only reason I rate this a 7 and now a 5 is that my kids really enjoy playing it, and I will probably only play it with them.

Initial reaction.  Cute, some fun.  The icons are a little hard to follow, we mixed up the purple and red colors.  Despite whatever the rules say, we will refer to the colors, and not the bean names.  Naming the orange pip the green bean seems especially silly.

I like how you need to pay attention during everyone's turn.  But I dislike that the dice are hard to quickly evaluate.  I would not want to play this on a bigtable with people spread out too far.

But the dice probabilities are interesting, and the various orders seem interesting.  I hope I have figured out the two tone orders divider on the cards correctly.

After 5 plays, I've raised my rating from 6 to 7.  Not a deep game.  But entertaining, and it has been well received by casual gamers who I have introduced it to.

Yahtzee meets Bohnanza. In terms of game mechanism, it is closer to Yahzee than Bohnanza. There is no trading between players. Still, everyone is involved even in other player's turn since one might benefit from the active player's die result. Other than that, nothing impressive.

A great dice game for 2 to 5 players. A great filler! And yes it really works with only 2 players. There are 2 types of dice, the colors are different, and you have to roll the right combination of colors to get money. If you like statistics you will probably love this game. And another thing, you get to use the other players rolls as well (so it is interactiv).

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed this dice roller.  Everyone has to pay attention on every person's turn in case the dice rolled give them a chance to complete an order or two.  I do wish the two dice types were more easily distinguished and  even some of the colors of the beans are hard to tell apart in poor lighting.  I do not understand how this happens in modern boardgames!

It's Bean Dice! How bad could it be?

Crapalicious components! Can't easily tell the orange from the white dice, so the key strategy is made difficult (which dice to take). Tiny percentile numbers are too small. Yellow bean - can't see it. Green beans are no longer green, nor purple, as in regular Bohnanza, but orange, Orange, I tell you.

Rote strategies, the game almost plays itself. The rules are vague in places (in the German, yes), but good enough to play and assume the missing points. Will try to marker up the orange dice to be Orange. Determined to play a bunch of these, maybe my opinion shall improve!

[b]UPDATE:[/b] Painted the orange dice ORANGE, helps. Re-translated some of the rules, also helps. Rating +1.

A nice light press-your-luck game where the inactive players are working off the active player's rolls. No downtime!

RATING: 8
As a general rule, I think dice games can be a bit shit. The core mechanic that they all share (poached from Yahtzee) of rolling, locking in some dice, then re-rolling, rinse and repeat, means that often they all feel sort of samey. Würfel Bohnanza doesn't really alter this, but it does add something new, in that the sets that you're trying to roll are different from those of your opponents, and you can score from opponents rolls if they roll a combination you need. This adds an interesting tension between locking in a minimal number of dice to keep your options open (and potentially rolling something useful for your opponent) and locking in several dice, giving you less flexibility.

The game plays quickly, rewards paying attention to your opponents' turns, and mixes some light strategy with a decent chunk of luck. As a quick 2-player (under 15 minutes) this is great.

I wasn't sure how this would be with two, but I wanted to try it anyway. It's not much fun with two. Many turns as the inactive player are over in the first die roll, so the whole game feels a bit saggy in the middle -- like, say, Small World with five. It takes too long for what it is.

I don't dislike the basic mechanics, though. With a couple more people it would go faster, there might be a few more decisions to make, and there would be more chances to fill orders as the inactive player. I'd definitely try it again.

I love Bohnanza and really tend to enjoy quick little dice games.  I wasn't sure how this would play out but I'm actually very pleasantly surprised by how well this captures the feel of the card game while providing completely different gameplay.  There is obviously some luck, but being able to capitalize on others' turns as well as planning out your re-rolls based on the face probabilities keeps it very engaging.  My only complaint is the two dice colors - they could have used something more distinct than "white" and "very slightly off-white".

The dice game treatment comes to the classic card game of Bohnanza. 

But this has more going for it than the average dice conversion of a popular title.

A fun dice game that has little to do with Bohnanza. Players are trying to complete bean combinations listed on cards in increasing order of difficulty by rolling dice. At any point they can choose to turn in the card for coins, depending on how many combinations have been completed. The game's turn structure, in which you can leech dice off of the active player, ensures that all players stay involved throughout. Good stuff!

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This has become one of my daughter and I's go to fillers when we don't have a lot of time to play something a bit longer. We can easily get in a 2p game in 15 minutes. Speaking of player count I wouldn't recommend nor play this game with more than two. Even though you can advance when it's your opponents turn, the game drags on too long with more than two players (with more players I'd recommend Qwixx).

Overall I'm happy to have this game in our collection and would recommend it if you're looking for a quick, 2p dice filler.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Nice dice with great artwork on them. 
My only complaint is that it is not easy to tell the difference between the white and cream colored dice.
- Turns are quick; plus you are always engaged since you can fill orders when it is someone else's turn.
- While there are not a lot of decisions to be made during the game, there is a nice push your luck element when deciding whether or not to score a card.
- The fact that you can sell at anytime allows you to sell one card and then start the next one with the same pool of dice keep the game moving.[/i]

A really excellent new take on Bohnanza. I have been a little disappointed in a few dice games that are remakes of the original games. One in particular that did not strike me as being too intuitive was Zooloretto Wurfelspiel and even Catan the dice game. They seemed to be a little brainless and maybe better as a kids game. Well, this one has clearly been play tested well, the mechanics are fresh and clever, and a it seems to be a great new approach to dice probabilities. 

One wonderful mechanic to this game is other players can benefit from rolls on other players turns. This prevents players from sitting and waiting while someone else rolls the dice. This really solves a big problem with dice games. 

You have a card that lists certain combinations of bean dice rolls. As you claim these combos, you slide a cover card over these achievements. Once you have claimed a certain number of dice combos you earn bean gold, just like in Bohnanza, where you have to plant enough beans in order to collect the gold. You can cash in your bean card for the gold you have collected so far and begin work on a new card at any time. And the thing is, you can see what your next card dice combos will be, because they are listed on your cover card. So it is possible to decide to cash out your first card and in the same turn begin earning on your second card. Absolutely fun, clever and addictive!

Don't come into the game expecting any mechanical or experiental link to Bohnanza, 'cause it ain't there. It's just another dice game, where the symbols happen to be beans. And as just a dice game, it's way too long for the projected 45 minutes. Having said that, it's an interesting concept, having your card give a sequence of increasingly difficult combinations to roll, and a decision point on when to trade that card in for money and get a new card. The decision point hinges around how long until it's your turn again - you can achieve easy combo's on other player's turns because their unlocked dice can be used by you - meaning each other player's turns are important to you, minimising downtime. The hard combos you aim to complete on your turn, when you have control over which dice gets locked and which will be re-rolled. I really enjoyed the first half of the game as a result, (but I like dice games), but then it's just more and more of the same, repeat until someone's completed 4 or 5 cards for decent money. There's no sense of story arc or climactic tension, it's just a dice rolling filler which goes on much longer than a dice rolling filler should.

"Simple dice game with some surprising (but subtle) depth. As you get more familiar with the math hidden behind the simple order cards, the push-your-luck aspect becomes more prominent. Solid filler that finishes in 30-45 minutes even with 5 first-timers. I like it, but it might be too dry as a filler, so might not get many plays. "

What I like:
- Quick, portable, easy to teach
- You have to pay attention when it's not your turn

What I don't like:
- Claiming at different times is slightly awkward
- White/off-white dice should have been more different
- "China Bean" art is pointlessly insensitive
- English translations call the red dice "green beans" 
- I wish it had some kind of space theme

This can be played as a highly random light game. But as you start to understand the clever design of the cards and dice, you see more layers. It's still pretty light, but it can also make you think on every turn. 

I would put the weight at least 1.5, a bit higher than BGG voters. My first game, with 5 first-timers, only took 35 minutes, which was a good length.

Not sure yet how to feel about this game. It is fun but doesn't feel like a lasting thing. The fact that other players can claim dice sounds good in theory but really, they have no control over it as it is totally up to luck of the role... We'll see after a few more plays.

Little dice game connected to Bohnanza, although the bean theme is completely irrelevant here. The two kinds of dice can be hard to tell apart, and the bean colors are also hard to distinguish. Labeling the die faces with letters A through G would have been better, and would result in the same gameplay.

The basic idea is very neat: you can also score in the turns of other players, which makes that there is no downtime. For me it personally takes too long: for me a dice game is something short that you play in 15 - 20 mintues, our game took 40 minutes, which is the time you need for the card game. Therefore only a 6 instead of a 7.

It is a lot of game in a tiny box. Rolling to collect sets and climb up your cards to score coins. The fact that every one can collect a set on almost every roll keeps every one engaged, even when they are not the active player.

Very light dice game that does not feel like a distillation of its predecessor at all. This is another set collection dice game that sees you rerolling dice, Yahtzee-style, in an attempt to satisfy the set conditions on your own personal field. You must "plant" at least one die each time you roll, so the turns move along briskly. You can also make sets on other people's turns, giving you something to do when it isn't your turn. 

Very light, very low-interaction. It's more of a low-brain nightcap than a fiercely competitive game.

Very nice push your luck game. Sometimes the decisions are not that obvious in comparison to other Yahtzee style games. The two different kinds of dice is a neat twist. For shorter games you should consider reducing the victory point requirement.

This may be the best pure dice game I have ever played.  It's just fun and you even find yourself rooting for your opponent.  I didn't think it was possible that there is a dice game that doesn't have hardly any frustration and has some interesting light strategy based on probability and also decided when you've push far enough on a card to harvest.  the other great thing about this game is that there is little down time as you can play off your opponents rolls so you have to pay close attention.

I got this from my girlfriend in june 2013. She knew I liked Boonanza, and she saw this at a store.

This game has a good 'push your luck' element, in which you try to achieve as many combinations of beans in a row, dictated by the card you're currently using. The more combinations of the card you've finished, the more points you'll get. But your opponents can use the results you rolled on your turn to complete bean combinations from their cards too. 

There's two groups of (slightly different colored) dice, with different die faces, so the chance of rolling a certain bean combination depends on the dice you currently have available. So you have to keep an eye on that, as well as the possibility that you roll results your opponents can use.

The fun of this game is mostly decided by the attitude of the people you play it with. There aren't many strategic decisions, but you can taunt and tease each other a little, which makes it a fun pastime.

A fairly subtle dice game where the push-your-luck element is in the cards, not the dice. A quiet, thinking / planning game rather than the raucous bartering of Bohnanza. 

Plenty of tough decisions here, but they are not obvious. If you just roll dice and then re-roll Yahtzee style, you're missing the point entirely. You need to watch the bean distribution on the dice, the dice colours, your two cards, your opponents' cards, the scores, etc.

[q="eknauer"]Some annoying production issues with colors of the dice and smallish cards but the gameplay prevailed in the end. The ability to progress when it's not your turn keeps everyone involved each turn and there are some nice push-your-luck decisions. 
[/q]

In the copy we played, red appeared magenta.  In some light magenta-red was difficult to distinguish from purple.

That said, pretty shrewd game.  The mechanic whereby non-active players use some of the active player's dice is a bit wonky, but it does keep everyone involved.

I wouldn't mind picking this up, if I can find it cheaply.

Played one 3P game. Wurfel Bohnanza is a light, Yahtzee-style dice game in which players collect sets of dice as depicted on their individual objective cards. Players can also fulfill objectives using dice rolled on their opponents' turns. Once a player completes a certain number of objectives, that player may cash his card out for VP.

As one can fulfill several objectives in the same turn, players may opt to lock in dice even though those dice can only be used to fulfill a future objective. However, there aren't many other meaningful decisions beyond that to set it apart from other light dice games. I also found having to constantly pay attention to your opponent's rolls a bit tiring after a while, and the mismatch of colours of the card icons and dice icons aggravated this.

RATING: 5
Typical formula completion dice rolling. There's a lot of randomness without a lot of way to control it, and that seems to be magnified by scoring (briefly) during the start of other players' turns. The result isn't awful but it's not particularly notable either.

Szeretem a kockás játékokat, az olyanokat is, amikben semmi mélység nincs, csak sima kockapóker. A Bohnanza kocka ilyen. Viszont ebben a játékban az a kevés döntéshelyzet, ami van teljesen egyértelmű. Különböző célkártyák vannak a játékban, ezekből mindig kettő van mindenkinél és ezen kettőből az egyik céljait próbálja soronként teljesíteni a játékos a dobása után, minimum egyeket elrakva, hogy a végső dobásában minél több sort tudjon megoldani. Az elrakáson kívül csak annyi döntési helyzet van, hogy a célkártyát mikor váltja le a társasozó 1-4 aranyért beváltva. A kockaelrakás teljesen egyértelmű, mert igaz, hogy ezt próbálták két különböző hatoldalú kockával érdekessé tenni, de ez nem változtat rajta. A célkártyák eldobása is egyértelmű. 13 arany összeszedése a cél. Figyelve a többieket egyértelműen lehet haladni. Annyi csavart próbáltak belevinni a játékba, hogy mások dobása alatt is tudunk a saját célkártyánkon soronként lépkedni, megoldani egy-egy célt, ha a másik kidobja a mi adott sorunkat. Ez a részért jár tőlem az 1 pont, mert így nem fullad teljes unalomba a játék 5 játékosnál a soromra váráskor. Az egész csak a dobáson múlik, az elrakás és a kártyabeváltás teljesen adja magát, nekem túl egyértelmű volt. A pontszám akár lehetne több is mondjuk 1-el, de semmi köze a Bohnanzához a megálláson kívül. Tehát annak hangulatát se hozza. Ebből kár volt kockaváltozatot csinálni.

This is yet another dice version of a card/board game. This time, though, it feels somewhat different: not quite so much of a Yahtzee variant, and it still retains a feel of its parent game.

Yet another game I wouldn't mind trading for!

--- Summary ---
There are 2 types of d6, each with different distributions of beans. The deck of cards show several rows of dice combinations; each player starts with 2 in a column: you use the bottom one to show which row you are currently working on in the top card. On your turn, you roll the dice; then everyone ELSE simultaneously sees if they can fulfill their combos, starting from the bottom of their card; if so, they slide the lower card up so that the done combo is hidden; may keep sliding as far as possible with the current roll. Then, the player sets aside at least one die -- unavailable to everyone the rest of the turn -- and rolls again. When they stop, they use all the dice they've set aside to complete as many rows as possible. Once players have reached the top several rows, they may (at any time) cash the card in for 1-4 gold (like Bohnanza, face down cards are used as currency) and draw a new card. A player wins by reaching the target score (13 coins?).

The dice game of the card game classic Bohnanza. Roll seven dice, and try to make bean sets on your cards. The other players can use beans from your first roll, but you keep rolling until all your dice are locked, or you are satisfied. How long do you hold onto cards to climb the ladder before turning them in for points?

Würfel Bohnanza (or in English, "Wonderful Bananas") is quite a delightful little dice game by a designer who is better known for creating large, painfully tedious, Euro-style games.  Possibly the best part about it is that all players remain actively engaged on everyone's turns.  Possibly the worst part about it is the physical production.  For a dice game, the dice suck.  The colours were very poorly chosen, and while symbols were also provided, the dice are too small to be able to differentiate them.  But it's a nice simple game (I gave it a "weight" rating of 1, though in my head I thought it was more of a 1.35, and was greatly amused to discover that the current BGG average weight rating is 3.5!) that still provides some interesting decision spaces, thanks largely to the distribution of the various symbols on the white and the very slightly off-white dice (again, what sadistic lunatic designed the components?!?).  It feels like there's actually a lot of clever maths behind the design, yet thankfully players don't have to know anything about that other than some basic probabilities.  So all in all, a nice dice-chucker filler.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Yahtzee variant where each player has an order card listing six different sets to be achieved in order, easiest to hardest ("two blue beans", "two blue beans and a brown bean", "six different beans" etc.). Rolled beans can be re-used for multiple sets, so a lucky player can go up two or three or four steps at once. Trading in the card after 3-6 steps provides 1-4 coins, respectively, and the same beans can then be used immediately to match on the next card, so there is an extra layer of strategy around when to cash in.

The novelty is that, while the active player can only make sets at the end of their turn (using locked dice), all other players can make sets from that player's just-rolled dice. But while this keeps players' attention, but they're not making decisions, just matching sets of colours -- it's still downtime and it's still very luck-heavy. It would be an interesting mechanism if you had enough control to align your sets with what another player is after so you could piggyback, but you can't; it's just random. More players add nothing to the game except more downtime.

I wouldn't want to play this again with more than three.

[Amiga 2012 edition] {Farm; dice-rolling; optimal 3p} This is an interesting twist of the popular Bohnanza game.  A good filler before playing heavier games.  It is not a blind luck game - players have to decide wisely which die to keep and when to harvest.

It is more or less a solitaire exercise between players.  However, the game is short enough to feel boring.

The rule is simple but my friends have difficulty in understanding how they can complete a field with a "fresh" roll of opponents.

The downside for me is deployability - each game feels alike even though dice are used.

The choice of color is poor - it is difficult to differentiate the color in low light condition.

And, I would like to have crafted dice instead of sticker dice.

Bingo-like element of watching for combinations on other player's turns. Not a lot of skill, though some choice of when to abandon a card. Choices are more meaningful with more players; since your odds are better of getting the high scoring rolls on your turn, the less time between your turns, the easier it is to just pass and wait for your turn.

There's really not much going on in this game.  You roll dice and everyone gets to score while you're building an optimum dice pile to complete your own orders.  It's alright, but it wasn't particularly fun.  Maybe it was just the 2-player version.

This seemed to drag on well beyond the time anyone seemed to want to invest in it.

I'm pretty impressed with this as a light dice game. The mechanic of involving everyone else in your rolls (As they try to cadge a few levels) is a cute one and responsible for a large part of the game's appeal. This comes out a lot as a filler when a few folks are passing time between games, and the fairly short playtime is also great.

The underlying push-your-luck decisions are less interesting than something like Pickomino, but the simpler decisions are made on a more complex space (different types of dice).

As a dice rolling game, this is a pretty middle of the road design. While the game operates just fine, there is nothing worth crowing about. The one issue I have is the slow pace of the game. For a dice game, you generally want the game to end after 15-20 minutes. A two player game dragged on for almost 25-30 minutes for us...a tad too long. While it is engaging watching and waiting for dice to happen on your opponents' turn, it is not as fun as rolling it yourself.
As such, I can only half-halfheartedly recommend this dice game. It is good for an occasional play or two, but not sure I will pull this one out with much regularity.

One note: I wish Amigo would consider re-doing the dice. The colors are garish, especially for the yellow China Bean, and what the heck is a China Bean and why make it yellow?

Dice games.  Love em.  This one is from the designer of Agricola (though much lighter) features, yup you guessed it, beans.  Use your dice to gather the beans you need to complete your orders and prosper.  I like how you can gain points from your opponents die rolls.  This keeps you much more engaged during the game.  I also like how you can score one card and immediately start working on the next.  My only complaint is the dice are hard to read (especially the yellow) and the tan dice aren't different enough from the white.  Minor quibbles though.  This is a solid game.

Really think this game takes the best aspects of every other dice game I've played and puts them together nicely.  My only complaints were a bit of clumsiness with people managing the same dice, can be a bit confusing when players can turn in cards.  Production wise I'd really want to see a few updates.  Two dice colors are WAY too similar.  Yellow on white is impossible to see.  Stylistically it's a bit of an eye-sore.  

Really hoping it gets a component update and is brought state-side and it would probably end up being  my go-to dice game.

This succeeds in being Bohnanza without the trading but with dice... so since I like trading games I'd much rather just play Bohnanza.  That being said there are some clever things in this game.  I particularly liked how other people can make you lock dice to complete their sets as it keeps everybody interested in every roll (though on the flipside sometimes it feels like people can take your turn away).  I also thought the way the "set collection" worked felt impressively like building up your fields in the original game despite being so very different in execution.  

Still... we had a long string of die rolls that weren't doing much for people in the middle and all those wasted die rolls really made the game seem to drag a bit despite not taking long overall.  All in all not something I would ask to play again but I wouldn't run away from it either.

Estimating probabilities and pushing your luck, a great little mathy dice roller with low down-time.

Cool & fun little game that plays in about 40 minutes for up to 4 players - works well with 2. I like that the box is small enough to fit in my pocket or a purse so convenient for trips where you expect to have some waiting time. Sux that the rules are in German only but fortunately there is an English copy you can download here off BGG. 

Couldn't find it for sale in Canada - had to go to amazon.com & order it from a company located in Europe so it took a while to arrive.

Only one play so far but it didn't click for me. Theme seems pretty pasted on, the dice colors are hard to keep apart (hopefully this will be fixed). And one of the special features (you can do an action during your opponents turn) almost never seems to kick in. In fact my guess what that this out of order turn is only there to keep you paying attention to what your opponent does - and keep you from falling asleep. Oh and btw: close to zero interaction in this one. With the flood of dice games coming out, there are tons of better ones to chose from!

En tu turno lanzas dados y los apartas a lo Yahtzee. El objetivo es obtener las combinaciones de tus cartas de ordenes. Mientras más filas logres de una orden más dinero da. Los demás jugadores pueden cumplir ordenens en el turno de otros mirando los dados recién lanzados.

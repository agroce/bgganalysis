After first play impressions are posivite. the chit activation system is very nice and depict quite effectively chaos theory in battles and difficulty of chain of command. The game is full of interaction between player and goes quite smoothly, BUT there are a LOT of units.
After some more playing (8+) I'm lowering the vote, it's not possible for a game to be in its third edition and sporting such an awfoul rulebook. it's not possible that SIX experienced wargamer are constantly flipping charts and rulebooks.
You'll need 4+ players in order to play this monster.
BEWARE rules and chart organization is terrible and you lose a lot of time looking things up. This should not happened in a THIRD edition of a such expensive game.

Having played TSS with 7 others and enjoyed the experience(25  years ago), I was hoping for the same with my 7 player WIF group.  The game doesn't work with more than 2 players.  With the chit draw system everyone sits around and lets the 1 player work for 15 minutes or so.  When you get 60 or so chits in the cup, well you do the math.  I think the game works with 2 players very well and think it would work solo. I would give it an 8 if our group could play the game.  Maybe Richard could put together some rules for multiple players. But what a really nice game that is so limited.  We are going to break out Terrible Swift Sword again and play it with the group. Then again OCS Case Blue might be more fun for the group.

A real commitment. If you love tactical ACW, you probably need to visit this, but watch out for some fiddly and hard-to-remember rules, excess chrome, and looooong game time. It's all pretty cool, but it also makes me pine for it's simpler granddaddy, TSS.

RATING: 7.5
It's Terrible Swift Sword updated by the original designer. It looks a lot better and the components are better and it's a treat for the eyes. However, the original rules have been doubled in length and I think most of it is chrome that tends to slow the gameplay down. Still, this is THE Gettysburg game.

The battle of Gettysburg.  The 3rd edition or otherwise known as the "2004 edition" due to when it was printed.  Note a direct descendt of the SPI(1st)/TSR(2nd) Terrible Swift Sword game(s). Note C3i #17 (2005) has updated counters for Pendleton/Alexander (0 not -2) and McLaws (not McClaws)/Kershaw.

Finally after long hours spent playing the game and arguing on the many holes in the rules we GAVE UP!
The rules are terrible, with repeated paragraph,typo errors, wrong player aid,  many questions arise every hour and im not speaking of rare cases but normal rules like "can a dismounting cavalry shoot?" (just started with buford cavalry mounted)
They also forgot to mention that the command range of the leades is 1/2 Mp on  road and Pike, so practically many divisions are out of command from the beginning !?!.
Also the campaign scenario is broken, in a place you read that u have to setup the units on the maps, and then follow the setup cards that instead tells you that all the units must start off map in march order....!?! (they enclosed the 1999 version of the setup card and not the 2000 revised version 2000.....incredible) just to mention a few difficulties we had right from the start.
If u have the patience to read all the forum u will find the right solutions but HEY this is the 4.5 version of the rules and the game is a reprint revised deluxe version....

I've played alot of Civil War games; this is by far the best balance of detail and "game" of the Gettysburg battles.  Full game takes SOME time to complete, but the results are worth it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent: Tactical - ACW - Medium/Hard

Plus:
-Stunning maps
-Fantastic tactical situation
-Chit draws are keeping the game fresh and lively
-Despite the rule issues and some other gripes (see below) like Bulge games, I don't particularly like Gettysburg games (I wished Lee had won this one to see what would have happened afterwards in the war...), this game however hit a soft spot.
It was on the shelves for many years of my FLGS and remained unnoticed. Before I moved to another city I decided to buy it. 
It took me a while to get it on the table but the session report of fellow geek Pieter Veenstra convinced me it was time for a CHANGE OF ACW HISTORY!!!
Bottom line, this game can be rated for it's negatives but also for it's positive parts. Most irritating to me is that the beautiful maps get clutterd with ugly counters so I have a love / hate relationship with this title.
I rate it a 9 for now but tomorrow it might be a 7 (so I guess I have to rate it 8...).

Minus:
-Campaign game is massive if you play with the full rulesset and I wish the game had a slightly easier system (like Glory for example). 
-I'm not a fan of the counterart
-Rules require much patience....looking, looking up again...
-Stacks can get massive
-Takes a long time to play, even longer to play it right

Sold it.

I just finished soloing Day Three's meatgrinder.  It's easy to play the Confederates-- all the Union does is shoot, shoot, shoot.  Not bad, not bad.  I can't compare it to previous editions as I never owned them.  Seems reasonably well laid out to me.

Initial rating based on solitaire play of first day scenario.

This game is more managable than some of the other regimental ACW games available, but still very large.  It will take a long time to play out each turn after the first couple of turns when only a couple of brigades are on the map.  Due to the chit pull activation system, the GBACW games from GMT aren't as well suited for teams as the Gamers/MMP regimental games.  I think GBACW games are just too big to be very replayable, so they're going to be a once every few years experience.

I like the fire combat system and the use of cohesion and disorder to simulate the disruption that can occur to units due to movement and taking fire.  I also like the way the chit activation system can really foul up some plans because certain commands can't move when their chit is drawn because other commands are in their way and haven't moved yet (because that chit hasn't been drawn).  It allows players to experience the chaos that existed in civil war battles.

I have the first edition.  This is the third edition of the game. What a game.  Great Battles of American Civil War game system at its best.  Complex, detailed and of excellent simulation value.  Great item to collect for everyone interested in wargame and especially, the Civil War.  The maps and counters, while clean and functional, are, well, just as top class as in any other form of art.

Exactly my cup of tea.  Whilst all the markers are annoying and the small size of the counters is made worse by the HUGE size of the map...this game is my kind of game

The game is good as a whole, BUT there is a mess of little rules that bog down gameplay. Is not a complex game (for hardcore gamers), but I simply cannot remember all the special cases... that are almost more than the normal ones. Rules are horribles, in layout and in holes. I'm against too many special rules for the sake of chrome, so my vote go one point down for that reason.

OK, I'm probably never going to play this, but I keep hoping.... Looking at the rules it appears fairly strait-forward.

Ok, I finally got a chance to play this one with three other diehard wargamers.  I will say that I don't think I would ever try this one-on-one.  The game is just too big and takes too long to play on your own against another player.  Having someone else on your side gives you opportunity to plan attacks and coordinate defense together.  There is really no way to describe how big this is - you have to actually see it laid out with the _tons_ of units distributed.  It is really overwhelming and the game is long, but there is no doubt that it is a lot of fun.  I don't think I'll get a chance to play this very often, but I will definitely look forward to every opportunity and make the most of them.

I am going to check out Vassal to see if anyone does this online.

Definitely a monster game with three maps and over 1600 counters.  You should get the latest version of the rules(2009 from Dead of Winter) before tackling this.  The first and second day scenarios are very interesting, although the third day one is for masochists only!

Same rating for all 3 games in the series.  Rules need work...and not just in clarity.  Typical RHB design: inspired, original, intricate, and only partially tested and thought out.  The rules are an imaginitive outline of a  game-construct, rather than the finished product of lengthy testing and revision.

This looks like a huge improvement in the artwork and rules and a worthy successor to the original.
Due to it's huge size (& lack of table space) I can see Cyberboard being an enabler for the play of this game.

I mostly like the chit pull system.  The other game mechanics are a bit of a juggling act (that second disorder table...) There are many WTF moments examining the map, unfortunately. More scenarios would have been nice as well.

RATING: 8.5
The Confederates have a tough time taking Gettysburg, but the Union reinforcements slowly trickle in, allowing the Confederates to swarm the Union positions. This was a highly attritional battle and there will be many routes and step losses. The marching mechanic is an elegant way of representing both march formations and traffic congestion along the main routes of advance.

This game is vastly superior to the game [b]The Guns of Gettysburg[/b].

Got this one for many reasons.  It was on sale 50% off at my FLGS.  Third edition rules make this a much better game.  The map alone is one of the best renditions of the terrain of the battlefield that I have found, making it worth the price I paid for this reason alone.  From a historical perspective, the units represented make this one of the more detailed references on the battle that I have.  It's one of the better tactical monsters on probably the most important ACW battle fought.  It's now OOP again by GMT.

Very nice evolution of the system, but way too involved for my tastes right now.  Love the look and respect the design, but be prepared to devote tons of time to it.  Leader activation is the main upgrade from the days of TSS, which is a great mechanic.

UPDATE:  I never played it.

I did not really know what to expect from this game, but, upon investigating its components, I discovered "Drunk" counters with little whiskey barrel depictions on them.  It was at that point that I knew I had to play it.

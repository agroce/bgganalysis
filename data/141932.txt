Played this 5 player and I think its sweet spot is probably 3. With 3 you are all actively invested in each mission but with more you just don't care about other players in the game. The rules also need some improvement as we frequently were questioning the precise meaning of cards which just drags out what feels like a very light game. It's a shame as there are some interesting mechanics here but it just feels not thoroughly thought out.

Full disclosure. I don't like the production quality of this game and could not get past it in order to see if I liked the actual mechanics. The spy theme and two sided card mechanic seemed different and appealing but when the cards come in a cheap box, are off on the color tinting between like cards, and have rough bumped edges I am inclined to not want to play. I will happily trade this game to a person who is fully informed and less concerned with appearance and tactile feel of a game than I.

Sick of games that have been coming out in the past 2 years with spelling/grammar issues. No excuse at all. Poor card quality is also common nowadays. If you try something new, get samples first!

And now we have to download updated rules.... Did she not test this game out before publishing it?

Provisional rating, might alter with more plays.

Like this - it's quite a novel little filler, and the dual cards are clever. However feels there's a bit too much kingmaking with the free-agents, where you play them and two people (you +1) get either the action or the IP.

Feels like it needed a little more development and then the game would be great. As it is, it's good - and given the play length, this is fine. Definitely a keeper (for now).

Only niggles are the cards, they all have little barbs on the sides, very annoying.

It's a neat filler-ish game where you play a card to either have the power or have the points, and whatever you don't choose you're giving to your opponent. The quality of the cards is suspect and I wasn't a fan of the artwork, which is weird because normally I don't care about that sort of thing. It does have potential and I would play again.

"You have part of my attention - you have the minimum amount."

Yet another tit-for-tat bash-the-leader card game with a minimal scope for forward planning and no coherent narrative to explain the bloodletting. Munchkin without the whimsy. Artwork is well-executed if you're in to Darker And Edgier (tm) brand American comic books c. 1990, which I'm not.

If you want a quick-playing game committed to a certain style of presentation, minimal thought required, and plenty of opportunities to screw over your friends -- I suppose you could do worse than this. If so, you're looking to get something out of gaming that is fundamentally different than I am and should probably disregard my opinion, anyway.

I got late to this party, having pledged for the fancy pants box with the full complement of expansions during the KS Agents Return campaign. Thus I learned the game with the MKII rules, which apparently are better than the original ones. Still, I found a lot of card text inconsistencies etc that should have been caught. Boo for that.

Gameplay-wise though, the base game seems to work well with 2 players, although it is much better with 3. It has a fluidity and immediacy that I like, without being too mean or destructive. There are a lot of abilities and avenues to explore, and although I wouldn't presume that the game is finely balanced, there is a lot of fun to be had with the game. The main double-edged card placement idea is wonderful and tense-inducing, and deserves further exploration. In addition, the often overlooked mechanism of playing a free agent card for your benefit against an opponent while giving the respective benefit to a third player is a very smart catchup mechanism.

Lots of good ideas, and taken for what it is, a very good game. Looking forward to exploring it further. 

Come on designer, you need to bring out a full FAQ and final rulebook, you're doing your game a disservice...

Has some really interesting dual decisions to make, in terms of which direction cards are rotated when played, and which houses to play the cards in.

UPDATE
This never gets played, which is both a shame and tells me something.  I've bumped it down to a 6.8.

UPDATE
I've played the two player game twice now and it is quite nice.  I recently received the revised Kickstarter (The Agents Return), and with the exception of the corner of my fancy box being smashed in (ship in a *^%@! box for goodness sake), I am thus far pleased.  The rule book is much better and the cards feel awesome.  Now, I want to play 3 players, as I think this might be optimal.  If the two player game isn't always won by the starting player (doubt this will be an issue, but we're two for two), I could see this getting bumped up if it has staying power.

7.5 after two plays (5 and 4 player)

I like this game thus far.  The rules are a little difficult the first time through (and different from the online PnP rules), but become clearer from then on out.  I haven't played with the expansions yet, but the base game seems to have many routes to victory.  There is luck involved in what cards you get dealt/draw, but skill involved in how you play those cards.  Both of our games seemed pretty balanced.  

I look forward to playing this with two players.  I often play Netrunner when I am feeling like a two player card game, but this one, while strategic, is lighter, shorter, and requires less rules review (for someone who doesn't play every day).  So, I suspect I will play it more often when there is less time to spare.

It has an interesting mechanic to where you either get the points or the action of the agents and your opponent gets the other thing. However, in practice it comes down to playing the cards so your opponent can't use what you give him. I've played it with 2 and 3 players and while it was received okay, it hasn't been a hit.

I haven't tried any of the Kickstarter expansions yet, but especially the Commanders, who give every player a unique special ability, look very intriguing.

You play cards to either of your two neighbors that will give points on one side and an action on the other, so it's up to you to decide who gets what. Then there are mission cards that score you points if your tableau meets certain conditions. 

Reasonably interesting, but I'm not one for take-that style card games. Here, players are going to have to openly collaborate against whoever is winning. Seems like it will need constant expansions to feel fresh.

Two plays with three, base game with no expansions. I thought it was enjoyable; the cards enable players to put together plans and the mechanisms are such that you can pull off some fun turnarounds. There's a fair amount of luck involved, but that's okay in a game this short. 

There might be some limits to replayability as is, but there appear to be quite a few expansions available to help mitigate that.

Rating could go up or down with more plays.

Some of the worst cards EVER.  Very slick and weird feeling.  I'm tempted to give it a rating of 1 just because of the cards.  But, I'll just take a point off for them, as they do affect game play.

Couldn't find an inventory of components in the rulebook either.

Lot's of 'thin' 'tuck boxes' for similar cards.  Why?

Wow, there were SOOOO many questions arising with just about every card that couldn't be answered by the rulebook.  Didn't seem to get 'blind' playtesting, as those questions on card play were throughout the game.  

The character cards were so unbalanced, it wasn't even funny.

One of the least enjoyable game experiences in a LONG time.

Very cool little game - rules are confusingly written, and some information seems to be left out.

The game when delivered wasn't properly playtested. Version two might be better, i don't know. Typical kickstarter problems.
Component quality is pretty high, artwork cartoony.

Strange VP engine eurogame. Instead of slowly building an ever-growing VP engine, with a combo of just 2 or 3 cards you can set up a very strong VP engine. However, these combos can also be quickly dismantled by an opponent with the right card... if they are lucky enough to have it.

The end result is a light VP engine euro with a high dose of interaction and luck but not very deep gameplay. For the kind of game it is, The Agents feels unpretentiously fun. 

The theme and artwork are nice and very original.

- Rulebook is kind of a mess, not design wise but structurally.
- What does "facing toward you" exactly mean?
- Influence Points should better be little chips (see Android Netrunner or similar). But that's no big of a deal
- Really really abstract
- Plays shitty with two
+ Probably a great 3-4 player strategy/card game with a nice theme though a bit disconnected from the game play.

If you can get it for 10 - 15 bucks and are into spies and/or good artwork, get it.

RATING: 10
I have now played the heck out of this game. The Agents is unique and very fun to play. 3 or 4 players is best for normal play conditions but you can change the rules a bit when 5 players are in to keep things interesting for all.

It's all about decisions you make in strategy to ultimately gain 40 or more Intel Points from missions or agents who all have unique abilities. It even has a small form of economy game play since you have to buy agents/missions or trade in missions for new ones.

The game length is on average 30 min but can go into 1 hour or more depending on how many people are playing and whether they are learning.

I pledged hoping for the best but not expecting near as awesome as my hopes wanted. I was pleasantly surprised with a very well thought out and excellent game (not just being biased here)!

This is why I gave it a 10. My friends and I have thoroughly enjoyed playing every time.

From the few plays I've had this game is brilliant. Unfortunately it's too complicated for non-gamers and too obscure for gamers who want to play the new hotness. This means it's very hard to get it played. It also takes a little while to get going, so the end goal of 50 Intelligence Points seems to be impossible to reach until a couple of turns have passed.

After additional thought, I've decided it's a clever idea, but not worth the trouble of getting it played.

Traded.

* Kickstarted! *

Card game for 2-5 players in which you must decide which is better when playing one: do you take the points or use the power -- because the other one goes to one of your opponents. From the beginning, strategy is important. And the fact these cards are plastic instead of standard paper adds to the level of quality too.

BIG PLUS: strategic selection of positive/negative
PLUS: plastic cards
SLIGHT MINUS: rulebook needs more info because questions arise, card sleeves on add-ons aren't great

A really amazing little filler. Plenty of interesting decisions as you decide whether it's worth giving your opponent some points for the sake of an agent's ability or vice versa.

Interesting game where you share rows of cards with your left and reight neighbor and when you play a card you can either it for points or for it's effect while the player you are sharing it with get's the opposite. First edition is FAR SUPERIOR to the secind edition which completely kills the game imo as it removes the need for tactical planing and makes mission cards completely unbalanced.

Feels very gamey. The game system works and is fine, but you never really feel the theme of Agents. You are always thinking about arrows or points. Honestly, I feel a better theme could have been pasted on this game.

Really interesting mechanic, each card is 2 sided and you have to either score the points for yourself and give an opponent the special ability or give yourself the special ability and give an opponent the points.

This game is genuinely ingenious and has a lot of elements both in its core format and expansions that make it a joy to play despite a minor handful of rules annoyances.

First: The packaging format of this game is ingenious - it makes it feel both portable and collectable. I want to bring it everywhere and buy more stuff for it!

Second: The cards ARE SO SATISFYING TO HOLD! They are made of a thin, flexible plastic. They might fade over time, but it will take considerable effort to bend, crease, or chip them.

Third: The instructions. Yeah, even in the revised version they're not so great. They explain things in a strange order, the most referenceable parts are in the middle of the book, and they go on at length about some simple concepts while staying nearly silent on trickier ones. The designers need someone who is good at instructional design to help them with the next iteration.

Finally, the gameplay. It's very fun, with a quick pace to start that belies the level of careful strategy at the end. a 50VP game seems high until you're scoring 10+ points per turn. Then, the game turns quickly to sabotage. Some of the rules are a bid fiddly (does a Paramedic allow you to re-choose the card direction?), and with more than 2 players it can become overwhelming fast.

There's enough to do with the base set that it will be awhile before you feel the need to pull out the expansions.

Plays fast and furious, with a lot of interesting combo's and mechanics. Some Missions are kind of overpowered, depending on when you get them, but we have yet to have a runaway leader problem.
The cards are a bit too slippery though, and there are several instances of bad spelling or confusion due to cards wordings. Nothing that makes the game unplayable though.

Not bad for a take that card game, with some innovative features. The missions seemed useless and way too expensive compared to how big and steady flow of points you can get just by aligning the agents, but maybe repeated plays will tell if it's really so.

After a video review

The artwork is nice, the mechanic ideas are interesting and the game is short. That's all the boons I can see.

Now for the bad stuff, the game is in fact very abstract. There is little relation with the theme since the mechanics used makes no sense with the theme.

The first issue is that fact that cards played benefits your opponent, even if it's a nice mechanics, it makes no sense in a secret agent game. The double function and chaining of agents is very nice, but they should be 2 path to benefit yourself, not your opponent and yourself.

The other problem is that the victory points are also money and normally these 2 should be separated.  You even get in situation when you need to pay points to gain cards that will give you points. So it create some sort of feedback loop.

I would personally asked players to complete X mission, or X points of mission in order to win the game. It would also gives a reason to accomplish missions. Because how the game is setup right now, you could win the game without accomplishing a single mission which is somewhat anti-thematic.

So again, great ideas, great potential, bad implementation.

First Impression:  

Enjoyed my two player game but I think I'd prefer three player.  Not sure enough cards come into play in a two player game and there is additional interaction involved in a three player game where people can focus on "bashing the leader" so to speak.  There is some luck of the draw - it is a card game.

Printed the base PnP for evaluation, and ultimately decided we didn't need the game in our group collection, though it does seem to hit a reasonable balance between complexity & play time. As others have suggested on the forum, seems pretty mission heavy (at least in my limited experience, 2 player games only), and plays much quicker than suggested from, say the Crit Happens reviews: 15-20 minutes.  Definitely interesting, and the 'double edged cards' mechanic is good: when I first saw it, I thought of the event card orientation in World Without End, and while the fact that the cards only have two edges makes it a little simpler, I can imagine with more players, the change of game state between turns will make it more meaningful as orientation swaps back & forth across factions.

Kickstopper. This game has an interesting and unique idea regarding the faction card lines between players and the orientating of the cards in those lines. However, there is a reason that people are employed as game developers; Not to mention proof readers (Neighbouring is not spelt Neighboting) and rules writers (the first set of rules had set up at the end...)

This game is fully competitive, but the gameplay was so frustrating, tedious and limiting that we ended up playing it co-op so that one player could win and we could stop playing the game. 

I'm sure this'll be a hit for some groups but certainly not mine.

A really interesting take on hand-management game. The half-arrows on the side of the Agent cards create arrows (when to are played side-by-side) and grant points to whomever they are facing. Additionally, the command text on the bottom of the card prompts the reader to execute the instructions. This causes are really interesting dynamic where the player is forced to make a decision whether to grant his opponent victory points and the player will execute the command text OR the other way around. This means that each play has direct and immediate consequences that either grant you or your opponent victory points.

The ability to swap, exchange, replace, return, move and flip cards creates a very kinetic and fast-changing game is works well with two players, but is exponentially more enjoyable with 3-4. 

The cards are flexible, durable plastic that allows for rough and fast play without destroying the decks. Great design choice and not one that is seen too often. 

Several expansions are available that only add to the gameplay without them feeling as if they were pushed for profit. 

Worth adding to your collection and a quick learn for hours of enjoyment!

Another purchase through Kickstarter and one that looks to have plenty to it.  I pledged for the 'whole package' on KS and have the base set and six expansions (each a small deck of supplemental cards) so replayability does not look to be a problem.

The game itself works quite well with two, but I think is a much better experience with four.  I’m yet to play with more (it can take up to five players). The ‘double edged’ card mechanism makes it a pretty challenging game to play and the variety of missions on offer also make each of the games we’ve played so far different, especially when the different commanders and their unique abilities are added to the mix. 

On occasion we’ve run up against situations where the configuration of the cards aren’t specifically covered by the rules, but it’s reasonably intuitive and isn’t too hard to reach an amicable accommodation without bogging the game down.

The cards themselves feature really appropriate and well-executed artwork that compliments the genre and, unusually are made of plastic which increases their durability and obviates the need for sleeving.  Weirdly, the basic gamebox has absolutely no extra room and the six expansion decks need to be accommodated elsewhere, unless you bought the USD$25 KS-exclusive super deluxe storage box. I didn’t and will probably end up housing them all in a biscuit tin or something like that.

So, all-in-all a good little game that seems to have some pretty good legs to it. I’ll be pretty surprised, and more than a little disappointed, if we’re not still playing it in 12 months time and beyond.


Update:

Being something of a Kickstarter compulsive I also organised a group pledge for the second edition of The Agents (aka ‘The Agents Return). The campaign offered more than the three extra expansions; it also gave the rulebook a fundamental rewrite, changing may key aspects of the first edition of the game.

The Agents Return changed the way the game turn is structured (with purchase and trades as separate, and always available, phases as opposed to being actions), raised the IP total for victory to 50 (and made it ‘sudden death as opposed to playing out the turn so everyone gets and equal number of turns – note the game setup was also changed to even out this change), and most significantly changed the way agent actions work when played to the affected player ‘may’ rather than ‘must’ use the ability. 

I have only one play so far and it went pretty well. More play is needed to fully gauge to impact of the changes in The Agents Return, but I will certainly be looking forward to trying out the new rules, new expansions. A keeper and one I do not regret backing. Good thing too as I also pledged for the ‘fancy box’ as an optimal storage and transport solution for all the game components.

I should also say that Saar Shai ran a fantastic Kickstarter campaign and really went above and beyond to keep his backers informed and even made a very magnanimous ‘make it right’ gesture when printing was delayed by providing a copy of the artbook (an optional add-on) gratis to all backers by way of apology.

Downtime in 4p is a bit high and I also find the game is very random with a lot of bash the leader and kingmaking. I dont think theres a lot of strategy though the idea of a good card that helps me and helps someone else is good. But the fact that the two cards you draw is random and theres lot of just stealing or killing enemy agents and missions means you cant really build any sort of engine or really truly rely on a set of cards to earn points from you. And even if you do get the most points, it just makes you a target for negative effects. The downtime is also high with nothing to do while waiting around. And I mostly dont care what my opponrnts do because when my turn comes, Ill draw and discard and will probably have a new hand so its not much planning I can do that isnt wasteful. Themewise this was decent and a good idea but exrcution meeds help

Plays: 1 at 4p with no expansion, Ks ed though

Varied and interesting decisions, but without overwhelming options on a player's turn which cuts down on potential AP.  Game is balanced and greatly re-playable.

Plays as well with 2 as with (3 or 4 or) 5.

I love this game.  I'm not really sure I care which edition I play, it just works.  It looks distinctive from across the room with the diagonal rows of cards, and stunning close up with Danny Morisons iconic art.  The gameplay is simple yet deep, endlessly expandable, and the various rulesets and "Break the Rule" cards allow for it to be tailored to almost any group.

Fast paced and relatively brief card game about secret agents. The theme is a bit loose on some points, and that's where the abstract part comes out.

The art is nice, the cardstock is plastic, it feels nice to the touch and they don't need sleeves. The hues on the backsides are slightly different; it's not a big issue if you don't know by heart what are the different cards and pay a lot of attention.

The game shines on
·) Interaction: each of your action is an interaction.
·) Originality: the mechanic of either scoring the points and giving away the ability or the opposite is really nice!

The decisions are quite simple and the gameflow is fast.

On the flipside:
-> Lack of control: the actions of your rivals will define your outcome more tan your own actions.
-> Lack of balance: especially (but not only) in the missions: some are almost unnatainable; even if they give 3-4 points, you'll spend 3 points to buy them, make a big effort to validate them, and then enjoy the success during 1 turn at the most, because even if you manage to accomplish it, your rivals will not allow you to get that many points a second round. So, a huge waste.
-> Horrible rulebook, confusing to say the least. Also, there are spelling and grammar mistakes on the cards. 
-> Need more diversity: there are a few cards/actions, and the rest are just variations of it.
-> Snowball effect. It's not really that, but once you get a setup of agents that gives you above the average points, it takes time to change the situation completely, and usually the lead you gained is enough to get the win.

Edit: August 2014 reduced rating from 6 to 5.5. Definitly, the lack of control kills the game. I still have to try the expansions.

January 2015: The "expansions" don't add a lot. They include very few cards each, very few new mechanics (not original at all). The rules are also quite confusing. They are more promos than expansions, clearly overpriced.

Its randomness kills replayability, especially for euro lovers.

I've read that they have revamped the first edition, with some important rules changes and also re-balancing many cards. But they did it in another Kickstarter, and it's being hard for me to find information about that.

The horrendous manual, their erratas and mistakes, the lack of balance, gives the impression of a hasty non profesional work. If you add the poor and overpriced expansions, those new changes they did only for the people who paid them more money and many other small details*, it is evident to me that the designer is only in for the money. 

The game is not bad and the underlaying idea is very interesting, but it could have been so much better if the people involved really cared.


* The poor quality of the boxes, their lack of space considering they sold all the expansions along with the base game all pushing you to buy the "high quality" box they sold for 25 bucks; many "expansions" with such a low card count that they seem just promos, why having 2 different mission expansions with 12 cards each where they would should have had just one with 24 cards (24 cards can hardly be called expansión)? Just to be able to charge you more...

A surprisingly deep tactical card game with simple gameplay mechanics! The central theme of the game is every time you play a card, you can either choose to gain points for it over time at the expense of giving an opponent a powerful ability, or give yourself a powerful ability but give an opponent points over time. Since the whole objective of the game is to get 50 points, every card you play requires you to seriously consider how much that extra point or two every turn is worth versus gaining the use of a potentially game-changing ability!

It's a cards-with-powers game which nearly always have some decent replay as you explore the different ways the game can unfold, but this feels a touch out of your control. It's expensive to buy cards, so if one player gets a good combination of event cards and scoring cards with what they're initially dealt and with initial buys, they're off and running. Meanwhile, another player doesn't get anything interesting or that riffs off each other and they'll plod along accumulating less VP's each turn. Trying to slow down the leader maybe if they're neighbours. And what you play to which neighbour also helps accelerate their game - you play each card between a neighbour, so if you play for points, they get a power, or vice versa, which is a neat feature. But who you play to helps decide their fortunes as well. This together with the wysiwyg card nature of the game means it all feels a bit outside your control, even though your turns are interesting in themselves (points vs powers). All in all, probably worth exploring but leave your heart at the door.

(1 play)  It's a quick card play game that takes about half an hour. This game has two big things going for it. 

First, each card has two orientations. Right side up, a card gives you a special power, such as move another card, or flip it, or discard it. The opposite direction gives you points that you need to win the game. Trick is, your opponent gets to do the thing you didn't pick. I want the points, Sarah uses the card power. I want to use the card power, Sarah gets the points. It makes the "TAKE THAT" nature of the game a bit easier to enjoy, as you're always getting some kind of reward - even while you're getting screwed at the same time.

Second, the cards stay active when they are in play, so the special powers can be re-activated over and over again, or moved around. Turns out, there are a ton of little tactical options you can pull each turn. It reminded me a little bit of Babel, a game I really enjoy, also with a head spinning number of clever tactical moves to switch things up.

I enjoyed the game quite a bit, but I was imagining adding another 6 (SIX!) expansions to the game with all the additional cards and rules and so on - and it wasn't sounding great. The base game is fun enough for now.

The concept of having cards that affect both players is a good one. I do enjoy that aspect of the game. The cards are made of a cool plastic that I like. Everything would seem to come together to be a great game, but it just ended up being average for me. I could see how people would like this game more, but for me it was just okay. The bottom line is that I would play 7 Wonders Duel and a number of other games that take 15-30 minutes before I played this one.** Wife:6.5

Only 2 player games so far: I very much like the artwork (that's the main reason why I kickstarted it) and the plastic cards seem to be quite durable. I like the aspect that you have to decide to either give your oponent intel points (aka victory points) or an action, so you have to check which side is the lower evil and suits you best at the same time. The agents and missions do not seem to be balanced too well, and especially with the missons there are some nasty combinations which net many intel points which the oponent usually cannot do much about. Nearly all our games had a very uneven development usually one player started to take the lead and that did not change much until the end. So as a filler it's nice and fun, but nothing for more "serious" players.

11-03-2014. Nice, thinky game. Fun twist in this game is that you play cards facing your way or your opponents way. You get a special ability or points, depending on the direction. You can also play mission cards that give you special conditions to which you can score VPs. You can spend VPs to buy cards. Of course, in the end you win by owning the most VPs, thus all mechanics ensure that decisions are meaningful, constantly sacrificing VPs for abilities, to score VPs etc. 

For me, this game demonstrates the good sides of Kickstarter. While you can argue about production and quality of the (plastic!) cards, the game is novel and might not have found a publisher on it's own. Ultimately, the game is here and (reasonably) well executed quality-wise.

Honestly, this game doesn't get as much table time as I'd like.  I backed this game as a Kickstarter and was really looking forward to it, but it's not nearly as "new game group" friendly as I had hoped.

My wife and I played the games eight times in one night and had a blast. We played 2-player three times and 3-players for the balance with our renter. We added in the Special Agents deck for the last two games.

All in all we really enjoyed ourselves. There can be a bit of paralysis analysis anytime you add a new deck for the first time, mostly because you want to watch how everyone else is playing their cards and have no clue what you're going to do on your turn. 

The Agents plays solidly as a 2-player game. I highly recommend it for strategy lovers.

RATING: 6.5
I am rather confused with this one. It is an interesting game, but is it fun too? There is so much randomness on it, that seems impossible to have any control in the outcome of the game when you play against more than 1 opponent. You either spend too much time considering all of your options and increasing the downtime, or you go for what seems good enough, but what happens then is that the player that has established a better point flow will cruise to victory without being stopped. Or you can try to stop him and the 3rd player messes up your plans and even helps him.
It is more complicated than it seems, and needs time invested on it to get its secrets. But it is not so much fun to attract the player to offer that time.
As far as the components, I find the art nice and fitting to the theme but I would prefer a different material for the cards. That plastic smells really bad!
I can't say I regret backing this game on KS, but until now there is a rather bittersweet taste that it lefts to me.

RATING: 4
Interesting card mechanic that unfortunately lacks the fun factor. Beyond the dual card decision you're mostly just going through the motions and playing the best your card draw allows. The better play is just a bit too obvious. Decisions are only mildly interesting. Beyond deciding which side to play your agents your other main decision is whether to scrap your agents and redraw or not. There must be more to it than this because the game doesn't tick over at a very fast pace, but unfortunately I think not - the slow play seems to be a result of the need to read card text and understand it.

This is going to be a better game with three players than more than that. Less chaos, faster and more control. I might be willing to play with that number, but I'd prefer many other options.

Just a bit dull, where the game length feels longer than it really is.

RATING: 8
A very fun combo-building game marred by poor production decisions.

This game is a product of Kickstarter, and it really shows. I don't mean that in that the game is an under developed mess, I mean that in this is a fairly simple and straight-forward card game that due to it's success in crowdfunding became a mess in production.

First, and more obvious, the cards are plastic. Why are they plastic? Because it was some stretch goal. Now I've played Gloom, I felt this was probably unneeded, but didn't have objections. 

Let me be frank, THESE CARDS SUCK. They were produced in sheets that had to be punched, as a result there are little nubs on the sides of the cards from where they were attached to the sheet. On top of this, the backs do not match. There are noticeably different shades in the print of the card backs from sheet to sheet. The cards can crack, I say this because one of my cards arrived cracked. Obviously paper cards can rip but I've never received a torn card in a new game. Lastly, they are terrible to handle. They are small (bridge size) and slide around. It's hard to describe exactly but they're a production failure across the board.

Next, in the game you accumulate points, and then can spend points to buy new agents and missions, first to 40 points wins. The points are on these awful cards as opposed to simple punchboard chits. it works but you're using something the size of a card for something the size of a nickle would have worked perfectly.

The rulebook is a mess to read. The rules for setup are in the back right before the FAQ, every section is seemingly arranged at random. Everything you need to play is in there and well described, but it might take you a minute to figure out what's going on. It's a fairly simple game though and a pretty short rulebook so this was only a minor issue.

Lastly, all the content created for kickstarter is literally worthless. Now I don't own any of the add-on expansions, but I did look over the print and play files and they are so wonky and off balance I feel they would ruin the game. Perhaps the missions expansion would be ok with light pruning. The commanders expansion (which was included in my box) is so off balance it's laughable.

Now that the bad is out of the way, how does the game play? Pretty darn good actually. You play cards that have two effects one for you and one for an opponent. Both effects are positive (or can be) so it's a game of evaluating when and what to play, of chaining combos off of your agents.

I found it very fun to play, so I'll keep it, but the basic game has under 50 cards, so I'll always sort of resent it's not simply produced on normal cards with punchboard chips in a Coloretto sized box.

Interesting idea and mechanism, but the game only kind of works. Play can become cyclical/repetitive and even semi-stuck.  It just isn't very good and is clearly under-developed.  I was really hoping for more, but unfortunately it turned out to be more gimmick than actual game.

Note:  The plastic cards have good color and feel, but the little tabs on the edges are really annoying and the cards can be a bit slick.  I'm also not sure why the Agents cards weren't full bleed like all of the other cards.  Looking at them, it seems to be a zoom problem and publication oversight.  If they were full bleed, then they arrows would actually touch and line up properly and they would be more visually appealing.

I love the back and forth effect created by the idea of giving your opponent the half of the card you don't take for yourself.  Take points now and your opponent will be able to mess around a bunch of turn the tables on you.  Give yourself the abilities first and you will need them to catch up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A fun and somewhat strategic game.  A great 3 player game, but the double-edged cards only really shine with this many players.  In a 2-player game, it's usually fairly apparent who's going to win about halfway through the game.  The additional expansions don't really add much either, only serving to dissolve any chance of strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really wanted to like this one. I really like the interesting dilemma of using a card for it's power and granting your opponent points, or using it for points, and granting the power to your opponent.

In practice, it seemed to introduce a lot of action paralysis.

I understand that there are new and improved rules (content, not just formatting and clarification) that improve the game, but I haven't tried them. The original rules did leave a bit to be desired.

RATING: 7
Really interesting mechanic, although suffered very badly from king making dilemmas in my two plays. The idea of giving points or powers to others in exchange for gaining something yourself is great, but seems very likely to result in one player who is out of the game randomly determining the winner, because giving points or abilities to others is inherent in almost every action.

RATING: 5
Hmm. So, at the beginning I drew a mission card which said 'if you don't have any arrows pointed at you, score this mission in a faction for 3 points'. Well, early on that won't be the case, so as long as one card is in one of the 2 factions near me, there's 3 points every turn for free. So, opponents, do you have any cards to steal the mission or kill the agent? If not, I'll score 3 points every turn and the only thing you can do is play more cards in to the same faction, giving me either more points or some abilities. Let's draw a second mission: 'if there are 2 dead agents adjacent to each other in one of your factions, score 3 points'. Marvellous, that's easy since everyone has been killing off powerful agents. Now I'm scoring 6 points each turn. Try and stop me.

Hmm. This felt a little underdeveloped. It seems like there is little scope for clever play and a lot of room for lucky card draws. The decisions felt pretty slight and never difficult to decide between. One player said 'it feels like they're trying to be too clever'. I think she may have been right.

RATING: 8
Originally a 9 due to the fun factor and in spite of a number of problems with the rule book and card use clarifications/ambiguities. Dropped to 8 after more plays. Most of my plays have been 2 player, and I expect 3 or 4 players is probably best. Omen: Reign of War, while very different, edges this out for me.

I really enjoyed this game. Almost every action you do has some benefit for the other player, unless you really play your cards right. Seemed very well balanced, nothing too overpowered. The weight and length of the game sat really well for me too. Can't wait to try it again.

Love the double-edged cards and all the choices it gives you. You are always presented with some decisions both on your side to stack up more points, but you also have to stop your opponents cards. And each time its your turn something has drastically changed, and you have to make new changes. Very interesting! The artwork is amazing. And i looooove the plastic cards, they look and feel great!

Half baked like most Kickstarter games. The end quality of the cards was disappointing as well considering the print and play version had the arrows right along the edge. 

I guess they cheaped out instead of actually making this game properly.

Half baked, half produced; avoid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The artwork is fantastic. The abilities and arrows seemed to be neat game mechanisms. However, it just fell flat for me. Even when I pulled off some impressive turns for points, the combos did not feel complete. This game is almost there, but not quite. I would try it again with 2 or 3, but probably no more than that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Backed on Kickstarter

Not impressed at first; too much of scoring relies of Missions, which can reliably be milked for points if you luck out on drawing an appropriate one. While you're in the lead, the pressure is on your opponent to pay VPs to get more cards and catch up. 

On top of that, the game gives me a firm negative opinion about plastic cards. All the disadvantages of sleeved cards (slippery, hard to keep in a stack) with none of the additional protection.

I want to play this a few more times before I decide whether it goes on the trade pile or not.

Update: sold

 I really like the double sided cards - no matter what you play it can potentially benefit the other player.  Makes for some tough decisions.  Most of the time I have only had 2 players for this game.  Every card effects both of you.  Games with 3 and above get interesting, because you can choose what to do to who. It's a good game for 2, but adding in the extra people made me enjoy it more.

  I really like the plastic cards. I didn't think all that much of it as a stretch goal, but now I'm glad it happened.

  The manual seems backwards, but not so much that you can't figure out how to play.

I backed this game on Kickstarter. Overall, pretty happy with how the Kickstarter was run as I got the game in a pretty timely fashion and the quality is very good (except slight nibs on the plastic cards). I got it with the fancy box which is absolutely fantastic and almost the best part about the game (this might not be a good thing...).

I ordered the game with all the expansions and haven't  yet played it with all over them yet. However, I have played the base came a few times. 

My first impression is that it's an O.K. game. The mechanic where you either take the IP or take the command is interesting as it really makes for some tough decisions. Usually you can play an Agent where it's not a difficult decision though. The game isn't that difficult to learn, but pretty difficult to master and is prone to some analysis paralysis. My rating for this game might go up after playing it a bit more, but right now it just feels like an average game.

PnP demo version. Innovative game mechanic, tough decisions and little luck for a card game but at the same time very short game time = very promising. Thought about Kickstarting, liked it a lot myself but didn't hit a homerun with my gaming group, so with the kickstarter risk this one didn't make the cut, at least until available through normal distribution channels.

Option to add or remove various expansions to modify the game to your taste or add variety.

Rules could use a bit of a tidy up. There are a few confusing cards and interactions.

Overall highly recommend.

Edit: the 2nd edition tidied up the rules considerably. A very polished game now.

Shipping could have been better but the game is good. You play against the persons on you left and right.  The cards have 2 sides (point or actions. So every action in your favor also favors that opponent.

Only real thing I like about this game is the quality of the product itself. Cards are fine and I love the design of the box. Sadly, the gameplay itself is very lacking. Gets boring halfway in and didn't really feel the theme. Also, they don't add enough of the intel cards. The entire table had to play a minigame that consisted entirely of exchanging larger denominations for smaller ones just to keep the bank filled for others.

This reminds me of Guillotine, at least superficially. It's all about manipulating rows of cards to maximize scoring. Although it's obviously very abstract, the theme fits the card play well and makes it feel more interactive than it actually is.

The art is sort of an acquired taste, all though it is certainly functional. The cards are textured nicely, but they obviously had some issues in cutting them. There are all sorts of centering problems and hand-slicing burrs on the side of most of the cards. It's sloppy and certainly makes the game a harder sell to prospective players. I had reservations going in because of it, but once I played through a few turns I came around to enjoying it.

game is short & easy enough to not outlast its welcome.

Played w/ two, and took a moment to figure out the orientation of starting cards:
I suspect it's more intuitive w/3-4 players, and likely not worth playing w/ 5

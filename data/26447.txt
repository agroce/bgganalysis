Up to know I only have solo played the 57 scenario, but my impression is that CoM is one if the best CDG games. 
Nice components - yes, for the map the artist could have use a better scheme of colors - but I like the overall result.
The theme is great, a fascinating period of the european history, and you will discover a lot during the play.
A lot of rules, anyway everything is well organized and it's easy to find in the rulebook an answer when something is less clear. 
I'd like to have a better player aid for diplomatic rules.

RATING: 6.5
Based on 2 incomplete game play. Starts slow but builds up to large struggle with hugh armies. Might have missed a few smaller rules and exceptions. 

Because of this 'slowness', it does not give the excitement that path of glory has. 

Need a few plays with practice on those lesser rules to feel if it's better or.......

Map is kind of ugly, and a bit difficult to use.  Rules seem to be your standard CDG fare, which is both a good and a bad thing.  Didn't get far enough in to try the things that would make this unique.

I wasn't too sad when I lost this game, because it meant it was over.  I can't say that it is a 'bad' game in the traditional sense.  It is very well done, and lacks any major flaws in the game play.  The large number of factions and mini-factions is appealing as well.  The problem is that there are so many games like this that I prefer, both for fun and ease of play, that I doubt I'll ever want to play this again.  It may be a great game for the right person, but I feel it is full of circumstantial rules that add little to the thematic experience, while mucking up the game flow.

RATING: 7
Very preliminary opinion after playing one season of the 1757 scenario.

This is a rather more complex beast than your average CDG; often this doesn't really help the game and it feels merely cumbersome and largely unnecessary (chits, tables, rolls, more tables, more rolls; do you really need all that for a random event?). And then some things like the colonial war feel like a pure luckfest (let's see who gets the highest roll!). But it felt like familiarity with the rules might make it flow much better, and the game looked interesting enough to make me want to give it another try.

Oh, and I played Britain and felt largely useless... makes me wonder whether it was due to the scenario or if it wouldn't be better to play with only 3.

Edit: Played a solo campaign. Very long, and definitely not for the faint-hearted. The game isn't actually that complicated, just procedurally complex and quite fiddly; probably best played with vassal to help with all the counting. I think it's more a game for people wanting to play history rather than playing a game.

Every player should read the living rulebook & playbook before attempting a game this bloated with chrome.  Fortunately we all found the time to do our homework, so no one had to teach the bloody mess to anyone.  However, we did have to constantly refer to the rules for none of us had a solid grasp of the details.

To put my comments in perspective, I have only played the 1757 scenario, which ends before the winter and spring seasons.  We also played without any advanced rules and all of us were new to the game.  Perhaps if we had played one of the campaign scenarios, the extended length would have provided a more captivating game experience.  Lastly, I fall outside the target audience for I mostly play Eurogames.
 
The Clash of Monarchs' system reminds me of Wellington.  The main difference is that instead of using a bucket of dice, you are using a bucket of modifiers.  I usually enjoy games in which players tactically manuever themselves into superior positions, but those games do not involve 4+ pages of charts.  The worst part is that the additional chrome is simply adding additional modifiers that do not enhance the game.  For example, in the "Tactics" phase before every battle. you basically draw a random tactic chit, refer to a chart, and add the tactic modifier to the DRM aka battle dice.

Excellent game, but quite a challenge to get into the rules.  It will be very difficult to get 3 or 4 players together. Note: should play with 3, the 4th player (Brit) will have not much to play.  Should work as a team game.

RATING: 7.5
Played two campaign games to date, in whole or in part. 

Not for the faint of heart, this meaty addition to the CDG family takes some commitment. It leans towards a more detailed simulation of the war than how most other CDGs depict their conflicts, so be prepared. You are not only moving the armies and troops via the "normal" OPs/Event card play, but also controlling aspects of recruitment, the war economy and monarchical wall (aka national will). The complex Turn Sequence will leave you scratching your head at first just to get used to it, then scratching it some more to figure out just what you can do with your forces within it constrictions. 

There is a lot, and I do mean A LOT, going on here. It has the potential to eat up and spit out a newbie, who would be left shaking their head and claiming "Never again!". But I think that would be an error. The game's complexity lessens over time and you are left with a rich stew to "try this" and "see what happens here". My one real concern lies in the area of a certain straitjacketing of options for some nations. This may be an unfair criticism however as I am pretty much just shaking off the new player dust myself. Still, a little voice is expressing concern about early British and Russian options in the campaign as well as a certain overall pattern to play. I thought early British options in the 1757 campaign to be, to be blunt, boring. I am not seeing much for the early Russian play either. Bah... I am probably talking crap.

PROS: Detailed handling of a fascinating struggle. Unique experience in many ways due to its depth.

CONS: Complexity will chase off some and confuse others. Possible lack of options for some nations at times. Possible patterning to play.

Investment Required - very high: the base mechanic (CDG) is pretty deep, then the specific design adds lots of chrome

Return - substantial: game conveys a significant sense of the grinding nature of 18th century military operations, which sends up most of the old AH hex-and-counter titles

Just arrived 9/2008. Going to read the rule book soon! :)
First play in and so far so good.  Kind of reminds me of the AH Frederick the Great, but COM is like Frederick on steriods.  Good feel for the time period and I like the rules for the most part, although the KK and supply rules are a little murky, IMO.  The only other thing that stand out so far is the map: is it my imagination or is the map almost too busy? :shake:  Still, I can see myself playing this again real soon, so I think it is a keeper. :)  :thumbsup:

Reacquired via birthday gift in 2017 partly because I now have a solo CDG method to utilize.

After some sporadic play, this is now gone from my collection. Too complicated, too opaque, too much of a learning curve and the learning curve itself isn't much fun, just frustrating. Falls into GMT's large "had potential, needed development" bin.
---
I think at the end of the day, this is a 4-player game. As a 2-player, I don't think it's interesting enough to get play over its competitors. But I can see it having potential played with more; could be better-paced and more-interesting than Here I Stand or the other games in that genre. But, in practice, 4-player games are tough to put together and Successors may be at the outside limit of what is reasonable in practice, complexity-wise. Clash of Monarchs is definitely significantly more complicated than Successors.
---
Second impressions a little less favorable. Definite complexity issues, rather fiddly. Suffers from vague objectives a bit; it's really not clear what to do. French and British positions are thin on their own, but it helps to have the extra players so you don't have to awkwardly juggle multiple hands and distinct positions. Not sure quite what to think yet; it's got potential, but I fear it's just too complex and fiddly for what it is.
---
Initial impressions are reasonably positive, after a single play of the learning scenario. Complicated, though. Map is a little murky. But it's a neat spot somewhere between Paths of Glory and Hannibal. Tactical chits are a nice, if somewhat awkward, touch; a deck of cards would have been nicer. It's great that enough player aids are provided, and they are of decent quality; but given that it's a complicated game, they could have been better.

For me, the bottom line is that I found this a quite intriguing game, but I worry that the complexity is going to be a big obstacle to play; and it is a somewhat fiddly complexity.
---
Hmm ... a lot of rules. Of course, less than Here I Stand, which was reasonably manageable, and on the first pass through the Clash of Monarchs rules I felt like I had a feel for the game, where many GMT rulesets of that length have left me feeling bewildered. I'm optimistic, but OTOH, this is tempered by the fact that I've been psyched about so many of GMT's CDGs, only to virtually always end up disappointed ... so much rules grit. While there is a lot in CoM that is intriguing, the page count and play length are also worrisome.

But, it's definitely on my schedule to play.

So Close to being excellent.  Very evocative of the era and a total grand strategy wargame that i really like.  I've gained such a great primer on this war just by playing this game.  Like others that commented on CoM, I have struggled with figuring out the rules and the map at times plus all the bookkeeping, but I have found that once you get past the learning curve and get used to all the accounting, the flow starts to move along and decisions become more natural.

I've had a chance to experience many CDG games: Virgin Queen, Paths of Glory, etc. This one is definitely one of the most intense CDGs I've played and overall my favorite. The action starts immediately and there's really no let up for the Prussians (or Austrians for that matter). It's a great CDG. It is a bit meatier than other CDGs, but don't let that scare you away. Play it through a few times and it becomes pretty intuitive, and then you get a great feel for a very compelling system. 
Could the board be better colored? Sure. Could the rules be a little more precise? Of course. Is this still a fantastic game? No doubt.

More complex than most CDGs. Not primarily because of the rules (though the rules are on the complex side of the CDG spectrum), but because of the options available. So many decisions, and so many things to do. My knowledge of the war in Europe is limited (though I am learning!),  but I felt as though I was consistently thinking things through as if I were one of the eponymous Monarchs or top Marshals. I am sure this will be near the top of my play list for the next few years.

RATING: 4
Update: After further play I've found the chrome to be gratuitous. Did we really need two types of artillery, three different fort classes, and several different types of infantry and cavalry? The CIC stacking rules are enough to drive me batty, too. Instead of checking at the end of the turn, the game demands "at any time" which leads to constant stack analysis and contortions to comply with the rules, especially for the Austrian player.

The KK mechanism, while clearly researched, provides very little ROI for the amount of rules and time you have to put into it. Really, what am I getting out of this? Two experienced players will cause roughly the same amount of damage at roughly the same pace. This could have easily been streamlined in some way. The supply rules are another matter however, and someone should have taken a hatchet to them during the development phase. The Diplomacy rules should be tossed completely, since I don't think the game will stand up to anything but the historical results. The Russian/Polish situation is a joke, though the blame there lies mostly at the feet at GMT at this point.

Ultimately, the payoff I get from this game just isn't worth the investment I have to put into it to "get it". The procedural complexity is just too high.

[Update: The vassal module and playbook are now completely out of sync. Good luck finding the "right" setup.]

Boy, does this thing have a steep learning curve, pretty much at the limit of my threshold at this point in my life. But, if you can get through it, and do a few turns, you'll start to get the flow of it. Also, major bonus points for having an index.

The mechanics appear to be sound, the cards reasonable, and the actions varied. The charts, while many, are all useful. The most difficult aspect, once you get past the rules, is knowing just what the heck you should do.

Alas, all is not well. The map is somewhat dysfunctional. Cursive writing bad, mmkay? But, beyond that, the army boxes are too small and the subdued colors make it difficult to make out borders, terrain and even colors - the blue of Prussia is barely distinguishable from the black of Saxony. Function over style, please.

Some additional play has revealed that the KK system really ought to have been abstracted out somehow. The ROI just isn't there for the time you have to put into it. Also, a few of the cards are a real heavy handed crapshoot, and stand out in a mix of otherwise solid cards. The current diplomacy rules should probably be tossed out the window and simplified as well.

On the whole, though, a decent to good game.

I love CDGs and when I saw that one on The Seven Years War In Europe were under development I was instantly interested. I managed to get a foot in and I was not disappointed.

Clash of Monarchs is not an easy game to get into, not that the rules are particularly hard or anything, but it plays out markedly different from most other CDGs I have played. There's more information to handle and there are more options too. You have supply, sieges, plundering, colonial conflicts and more to deal with along with the usual movement and battles.

I was a bit overwhelmed at first, but when I got to pay it all fit together in an amazing game. It's a game that rewards strategy and you need to plan ahead to really crush your opponents. Use small forces to screen one front while your march another place with your main army. Bluff the opponent to think you'll strike one place and hit another and so on. 

I was impressed by how well this game works which doesn't happen often in gaming any more. If you like deep strategy games with a sprinkle of diplomacy thrown in don't miss out on this one.

And yes, I did playtest this game and I'm happy I did. Even if I hadn't I would still give it a 8, perhaps even a 9 as I wouldn't know how bad I was at it compared to some other players. :)

The fact that you can play the game with 2-4 players and it's equally fun in all instances is a great plus as well. 

Update: Tried to play it again and the rules are just too cumbersome to read when you don't have them fresh in memory. Rating down.

I played it twice,
when i first saw it on the internet I thought it was a game like Napoleonic Wars, well its not!
COM is a wargame more than a simple game and a very nice simulation of the 7YW.

The rules are well written and we found no mistake or difficulties in learning it.
There are alot of rules, but its not a complex game, all the rules are logic and simple to remember and once u understand them the game progress very smootly.

I played Prussia and it was really amusing.
Probably the british player is a bit boring becouse he has so many 3 initiative leader and so few 3 cards.
But as the game progress this changes.

I think that its the best to play it with 3 players, but britain or Fance are good nation to introduce new players to the game, they have time to learn the game if you start with the full campaign.

Concluding, I think that COM is a really good game if you have the group and motivation to spend 4 evening playing it.
There are anyway alot of scenarios that can be concluded in a coupe of evening.
But "Real men play campaign game!"

RATING: 9.5
In all, I think this game is actually easier and lighter than it is getting credit for.  When you first look at the rules, they are overwhelming.  But the system, besides the confusing diplomacy rules, is actually quite clear and unadorned.  There aren't very many exceptions and you are always doing the same thing.  If you are worried about complexity, do not be discouraged.  It is slightly hard to pick up but not nearly as difficult once you play a few turns.  It becomes automatic.

This game is quite unique in that it is a completely different game when played as the campaign vs. the shorter scenarios.  As a campaign, it is definitely a total war of attrition.  It is a dismal game--and I mean this is the best possible way because this was a completely dismal war for all involved.  I think the designer accomplished exactly what he wanted to in that respect.  As a shorter scenario game it is a decisive game of maneuver culminating in major field battles and finally siege to squeeze out a win.  The contrast is stark and kind of cool.

I feel that the game is pretty procedural.  Not as procedural as Asia Engulfed but not super far off.  The order of play is extremely important and colors the way in which you do things.  There are lots of steps of procedure to get through during each player's turn and the play order is very important.   

The game is also less card game than you might think.  My perception is that CDGs have been moving more towards card play interactions--this game is card driven but almost all the action happens on the board.

There's a lot of unique stuff in the game, and the Kleiner Krieg stands out as clever.  If you have not played the campaign game or one of the later scenarios, it doesn't seem important.  It is though, and it works very well.  Supply raids can be really painful (our campaign just had the Prussians annoyingly raided and forced to beat a retreat) and forage raids are basically the way you hurt an opponent you are struggling to defeat in the field.

It is early yet, I haven't finished a full campaign, but I am growing very fond of this game.  It takes some of the false choices out of CDGs with the minor force movements and it actually doesn't play very card gamey at all.

Jan 09

This is such a smooth system to play once you get the learning curve out of the way.  The way the mechanics intermesh lets you try a wide variety of different tactics.  Diplomacy is still a bear to understand, but allows you to do a ton of variant historical stuff so needs to be in the game.  The cards stay out of the way for the most part and let players play the game, not game the system.  Strong recommendation, beaten out only by FAB: Bulge as the best wargame of 08.  Can't wait for another game in this system to come out, hopefully an Austrian Succession game or something?  I can't emphasize enough how well this game works once you get the procedure down.

October 2009

This game gets richer and richer the more I play.  It also becomes easier to play and plays quickly.  Plays very well by e-mail.  Going to start my 4th campaign very soon.  This is a very well tested game as well, the games can be very close.  Up to a 9, becoming one of my go to games, my favorites.

The heaviest game on this subject, Clash of Monarchs can be a tough slog at first, and no matter what sessions will not be lightning fast. However, no other game captures the military, diplomatic, and economic realities of the conflict. If you are prepared for something involved and epic then you cannot go wrong here. I'd rate this higher but the rules have problems and the map is mediocre, even though the units are a treat.

COM is the definitive simulation, but it does not replace simpler games. Rather it has filled the need for an involved simulation on a war that arguably, nobody won.

I long to love CoM.  But, I just hate it.  Still...it rates an 8.

The ups are that it truly is about long-term strategic thinking.  Decisions you make very early in the war/game may seem to have no real immediate effect, but before the end you'll be cursing about them.  Sieges can take long, slow, crawling amounts of time, and in one swift dash an opponent can blitz across the map and shatter your forces unexpectedly.  Great stuff.

What I hate is that a couple of lousy rolls at key moments in the first few turns can really ruin the game for one of the alliances.  If the Prussians suffer 2-3 catastrophic losses because of some severely bad luck in the first year or two, there is just about no way they can recover from those loses.  Which means the game is prone to defeatism and despair...which is probably appropriate given that it's about war.

Ultimately, I'm still on the fence.  I must try this face to face before I try online again.

RATING: 7.5
Have played the two-player version several times by e-mail.  Rules provide a lot of chrome for the strategic level of play.  At times it seems too fiddly, but a better term would be too baroque, which is very appropriate for the period.  Downside there is you can frankly get lost in the rules at times.  But the upside is that the gamer is often faced with very difficult decisions having to balance multiple factors.

One thing I really like is bringing in the Kleiner Krieg, which adds a nice additional dimension.  I mean to read up on this more, but for game play it's a nice asymmetric option when you don't have the cards to budge your slow leaders (esp the Austrians), and allows you to put some pressure on the Prussians.

Right now I've dusted it off after a couple years and am playing with my number one gaming partner on Cyberboard.  Am seeing both the plus and minuses.  To turn it into a true gem it might profit from a scrub of the rules based on all the discussions and clarifications.  It doesn't detract from the game if you're into the period, but smoother rules would help.

the map does have some useability issues (art over function, army boxes too small) and the diplomacy rules could have been clearer.

CoM is a very deep game that I can not wait to play further.  Due to complexity and length, it will never be a 10, but this is one great game.

Very good: 7 Years War - Strategic - Medium

Plus:
-Great theme
-Great incorporation of strategic and tactical system
-Event chits
-Beautiful components
-Tense and fun gamepaly 

Minus:
-Limited number of cards for each player
-Heavy as far as procedures are concerned

Had my first gameand first impressions are very good but have to get used to the 'chrome'. This can be a bit frustrating in the first few games to forget something essential after a couple of hours of playing...  

Anyhow, this is quite a brilliant game given the complexity of the 7 years war.

Well, finally made it to the table! Bootcamped it at the local game club (see my session report); we were impressed with this design: thumbs up. Agree that the learning curve is steep (it's not complex, just a lot of little mechanics, some opaque rules and a not helpful map). 

If you are a fan of heavier, meaty integrated (poly/mil/econ) op strategic games, get this one.

Look forward to playing again soon.

I like this period, and I think the game shows a lot of challenges facing generals of this age.

This is the heavyweight in the current crop of Seven Years' War options.  There is a great operational engine at the heart of this bad boy, but it is surrounded by massive clinking clanking procedural machinery.  Each discrete element is intuitively accessible and works well in its own right, but the integration is cumbersome and inhibits gameplay.  I feel the good bits warrant the effort but this game is more lifestyle than pastime.

This is an excellent 7 Years War game, but it seems to advantage the Austro-Russo-French alliance a bit too much.

Wonderful use of mechanics to capture the feel of a historical period.  This game has just about everything you could want in a grand strategy game of the Seven Years War: chess-like marches and maneuvering, epic battles, light unit raiding, limited supply and tight economic resources, prolonged sieges, misguided monarchs, and the fickle hand of fate.  Be warned, however, the game is long, detailed, and chrome-laden.  Despite the level of detail, I found the rules to be easy to use and understand.  Particularly helpful in this regard are the highly detailed sequence of play (with rules references), the exhaustively cross-referenced index, and numerous examples.  If all of that were not enough, the designer supports the game thoroughly with prompt responses to rules inquiries and frequent updates.  This game is obviously a labor of love.  Well done indeed!

RATING: 8
Seven Years War...more could be explored for this era.  Strategic level card-driven wargame. The Avalon Hill's game Frederick the Great left me a great impression about the period and Frederick's generalship.  That game was fun, fast and crispy, with Prussian moving interior fighting against the Coalition powers.  This game appears to have many historical chromes and maybe the golden time can be simulated in this game once again.   

It is really an intellectual wargame...and I like the game simply based on this. There are many historical chromes in the game, from card text conferring historical reinforcements, Fortune of War guiding the fate of the royal family, to the combined arm tactics modifiers during battles. In a word, a lot of information and a whole bunch of them.

For a 4-players game, it turned out that Austria and Prussia were still the more active with more generals and forces on the map - the Border and Northern Regions. The French was in the south of the German region and Britain and her Hanoverian mercenaries were up north in Westphalia.

The map looks a bit congested at first but conveys a cloudy atmosphere looming over for the war torn countries. There are many cities (called spaces) and fortresses on the map to maneuver. The fortresses have 3 levels, mainly representing the garrison inside modifying the siege DRM. Some of them are key fortresses which worth victory points and in this game, you win basically by capturing these key fortresses with the highest VPs winning at the end of the scenarios. 

There are 12 scenarios in a separate Playbook - yes 12! We played the 1757: No Year More Rich scenario which can accommodate 4 players. The Introductory 1756 scenario is only for 2-players. I highly recommend that you do choose either one of them for a start because you can only do so much in an afternoon session. The 1757 scenario have 10 rounds, 5 each in Summer and Fall. So it saves a lot of work as it won't go into the Winter and Spring seasons where the administration work on winter attrition, monarchial will adjustment, diplomacy options (in winter), prisoner exchange, treasury adjustment, troop sustainment, financial straits on the strategy card removal, recruitment and redeployment are therefore spared. 

You use the strategy card to move your leader and his accompanying force on the map. Leaderless force can perform an administration march for free. The Operation Points on the card should be equal to or greater than the leader's initiative. Naturally you would find Frederick with an initiative of 1 while the clumsy Austrian Generals - Charles and Duan both have an initiative of 3! Enemy may intercept your moving force along the way if they pass the initiative roll of 6 or more after modification. Light units help to intercept by +1 plus the leader's initiative rating. 

If the enemy unit doesn't withdraw from the space, combat ensues. Both sides count the DRMs, which are nicely summarized in the player aid card. If it is not a city or fortress on a hill, all strength points in the force can join in the attack. The Commander attack or defense rating is the major DRM. Tactics chits, maximum 2, can be added to the battle for some more modifiers. You draw a chit if the force has more than 10SPs in the combat. A Blown March is a useless chit which confers no benefit and they only serve as bluff to your opponent. You can use it or discard it. A player can only have a maximum 3 chits at one time. Some examples of the chits are Artillery Up Front which offer +2 to Prussian force which has 2 field artillery units (they are few and you need gather them together for that), Able Subordinates can allow you to add the second in command's initiative rating as DRM. Some tactics are nation specific - they are available to certain nations only. To encourage combined arms, cavalry inferiority and superiority modifiers are also available if the mix of force 

You then make a die roll (2 dices are rolled if it is an intense battle in which some leaders are participating) and cross reference the strength points on the column of the Combat Results Table. The results are often the loss of SPs and determine the level of demoralization, which is then compared to the army endurance level (e.g. 3 for both Prussian and Austrian and 2 for Anglo-Saxon and French). If the latter is exceeded, the army routs and retreats 3 spaces instead of 1 towards the closest unbesieged fortress. Leader casualty is possible, and we saw some generals got killed, when there is a natural sum of 6. 

So basically that's it. The game mechanics can be basic at times. But there are some exceptions here and there that you get to pay attention to. With some practices, the game can go smoothly. However, it does cost you some time for all 4 players to finish their moves and combats. 

Ultimately, given its long playing time (I suspect it could be reduced significantly even if you are familiar whit the rules), I doubt myself if we ever can get another 4-players for the campaign game. However, you would find this game very solitaire friendly with so many information to process and historical developments undergoing before your eyes. The cards just drive the story along well and you would not be doing nothing at any moment. If you take the time to play it, you would be rich rewarded like having finished a Tolstoy novel or Kubrick movie. I myself certainly look for a chance to play it solitaire when time allows. Overall, it is a good game which takes a long time to play and finish. If you are a fan of the period like me, the game certainly worth its price a lot for the value. Just plan ahead and take some time to do it.

Extremely fascinating game. Despite not even liking the period I'm enjoying this game. It's my first CDG and I can see what the fuss is about. Each nation plays differently not only because of position but because they have their own deck.

I know some people love this game but it could have been so much better than it is if a strong game developer had streamlined the design.  I only played part of one game but it was too ponderous and fiddly to continue.  On to the trade pile.  I never want to play this again.  Part of this may be that I am lukewarm to the era, but I still believe the game would be far better with about 1/3 of the rules weight lopped off, and it could still impart the right feel without every single detail being simulated.

I love the mechanics of this game.  It recreates very well the struggles of each side in the Seven Years War.  The moves are frequently chess like, but then there is the issue of dragging your siege artillery along with you (and perhaps losing it if you are routed).  Great game that focuses on the Kleiner Krieg and the bewitching light units that show up to do harm where you least expect it (but also allow you to do the same to your opponents).  Crazy attrition, costly mobilizations, diminishing monarchical will... I think it really captures the bleakness of the war and the overriding drive to finish on top.  Also, for CDG aficionados, there are great cards in the game as well.

Well done components and faithful to the period in that it portrays a struggle to the death where the game grind down not only the armies, but the players as well.

Great looking cards, even if the map is a bit uninspired.

Good GDG game:  some difficulty in managing armies (a bad move on those stacks can flip your pieces upside down -altering armies values!-or, worst, in the next box). The map is its greatest fault:  you don't 'see' the territory, only a web of lines linking the single locations. Also, army boxes are too small and too few.
The whole war campaign (the most interesting) needs a loong time to play.

Brilliant Game.
Unfortunately somewhat mismarketed by GMT as a 4-player CDG. I would see it as a 2-player game as a tight control over all forces of a side is desirable. Also it does with its complex rules not fit into the standard expectation of a CDG as it was published in the past by GMT.

It takes some time to get into the rules and mechanics but after getting it right it is a rather innovative game. Much focused on Operations with a large variety of options how to maneuver and fight it runs very cleverly on a classic CDG engine to get more abstract aspects (Economy, Politics, kleiner Krieg) into the game without excessive special rules.

A 2-4 player CDG of the Seven Years War, with the usual list of good, bad and ugly generals as the Prussia of Frederick the Great fights off the Austrian, French and Russian hordes. Apart from the manoeuvring of armies, sieges and card-events there is emphasis on KK (guerrilla war), harassing enemy supplies and wasting provinces. COM is more detailed than other games of this ilk and needs some time to master, but is worth it. Players control Prussia, England, Austria and France-Russia with their own decks, but I would no recommend playing England in a four player game as they have much less to do than the others.

RATING: 4
The components are beautiful, it is a very nice looking game. However, some elements - text color selection on the cards, use of script font, limit the usability. 

It is the most detailed simulation on the 7 Years War - much more than the venerable Frederick the Great (which I liked). 

The rules while well written are as intimidating as others have said, primarily as a whole it is a complex system. One absolutely missing component is a glossary. Fortunately the fine index salvages the rules. 

As a game it is overwrought - it seems that the designer didn't know when to stop, everything one could think up seems to be in the game - the kitchen sink approach I suppose. One of the toughest decisions is decide what to abstract versus what to detail. 
I found competing and duplicated subsystems. It is like the designer couldn't decide whether it should be a CDG or should it be a activation point system, an operational game or a strategic game.
Examples:
Card events vs FOW chits vs Tactics chits. Card play in 2 segments (supply and main), siege resolution in 2 (or is it 3) places. Supply movement driven differently than troop movement. Recruitment driven by money, but then also by cards, light units are recruited differently than regular, and light cavalry is different yet again.
 
Operationally there are multiple unit types to be managed separately all having different impacts, which then is coordinated with cards, tactics and leader drms. However, it is presented as strategic game with focus on multi-year attrition of units and areas.

As a multiplayer game it is a team game, accept it, use the historical entry and dump the unintelligible diplomacy rules.

Each time I play, I find myself downgrading my rating, which is a pity, since there are several good systems and ideas.  However as a complete design it misses, all the various moving parts do not mesh well. 
The resulting whole is less than the sum of its parts

About 1/3rd of the way through a game right now. It'll probably end up as a '6' or a '7', but I need to see it play out further. The rulebook could use a re-write. A single topic may live in four different sections of the rules. My other complaint is that the chit are double-sided with different army strengths. We have knocked over chit stacks many, many times, in one session and had to figure out which sides were the proper units.

RATING: 9
Played twice multiplayer, during playtest, using the 1757 scenario.  Thus, I have not yet played with the diplomatic and financial/mobilization systems, which are done every year.

This is the most operational (as opposed to strategic) CDG I have played, which might account for the perception of complexity.  I personally don't mind a sequence of play with a lot of steps as long as the steps don't take too long to perform and they don't involve so many decision points that they slow down play unduly.

I found Paths of Glory to be more complex than CoM by the latter criterion.  In that game the play of a single card represented multiple decisions because each card had multiple uses and hence multiple opportunity costs.  In CoM, there are only three uses for a card: Event, Ops, or Supply Actions, so card play decision-making is relatively simple.

Usually you will decide to attack this fortress or defend against that enemy army; the remaining decisions are about how to do it.  I found that thinking like an 18th Century general will serve you well in the game.

I really like this game, but I won't be surprised if it becomes more of a devotee's game, what with all the other SYW game options out there.

I really, really wanted to like this game.  I hoped it would be the game that I turned to when I had to cure my "7 year itch."

I liked the designer's decision that each major power would have its own set of cards. 

Once, I started playing COM, gameplay became a chore.  I tried on 3 separate occasions to get through the grand scenario and "see the light."  Even with heavy errata, the rules, the rules, the rules, blocked the way.  (And I am a patient rules reader--sigh.)  Even on the 3rd try, I kept finding a rule that left me in the dark and ever wondering if I "get this game."

Good, serious designs from BIG companies have a designer and a developer, each with their own "integrity."  From reading the "Designer's Notes," its pretty clear that the designer was all over the developer to the detriment of the game.  

This may be the designer's game, but it has shut me out and leaves me with a copy of COM to put up for auction on EBay.

RATING: 5
I want to love this game, I really do, but I have given it plenty of chances, and it just resists all attempts to make it truly playable.  The rules are a complete beast, a mishmash of intricate subsystems that don't hang together.  Good strategic and tactical play is impossible without just getting through the damn thing several times.

And unfortunately, getting through the game even once requires a herculean effort of rules lookups, checking and double-checking to make sure that you have the right modifiers for this kind of fortification, and that you're not moving your general too far.   The whole experience is so exhausting that by the time you finish, the last thing you want to do is try to play again anytime soon.

This design gets the card-driven game all wrong.  The advantage to the genre is that a designer can abstract a lot of detail in favor of more complexity in the cards.  The designer or development team couldn't quite get there, and so you have a CDG system awkwardly grafted on to what is already a quite complicated point-to-point wargame.

If you are looking for a better (albeit much lighter) take on the era, try [gameid=12891].

Traded.  Cant stand "bubble" maps.  Petty, I know.

One of the best card-driven wargames published. The only reason that it doesn't get a 10 is that it doesn't work half as well when playing with 3 or 4 players: playing France or Britain (particularly) is pretty dull when compared to playing Prussia or Austria.

Space Cadets: Dice Duel is an absolute gem.  Played four games at Pax 2013 - including a 4P team based tournament - and as the current west coast champion I approve of this game.  :)

Space Cadets was pretty good, but this one is going to be a classic.  Super solid design: very streamlined, nearly all real time, very fast to play. Top notch production.

If you like real time games, buy this immediately - you will LOVE it.

RATING: 4
Not my thing at all.  I'm giving it 4 becasse to be fair, if crazy, chaotic, noisy, chromey, big dumb dice-rolling games are your things, you'll like it.  It does this fairly well. We tried slowing it down, but even then, why bother?  There are better dice duel games out there, and Giganten der Luft is a much better die rolling game.  If it was the best of it's type, I'd give it more...but it's not.

Played once with 4 players.  More players are definitely needed to get the most out of the game.  With 4 (2 on each team), there's too much to do to keep track of everything.

Artemis in a box. Space cadets dice duel is a real time team versus team dice game about ship versus ship combat iiiiiin spaaaaaaaace. Really good time but it is a game that really needs the max player count to run well and practice to not feel like chaos in a box. Once your group hits a groove though this game is great. The custome dice and specialized stations for players really makes the concept of division of labor and a space combat simulation a good time. It is a table hog though so make sure you have plenty of space.

I loved the chaos, but not everyone from my group did. Will have to switch up the roles and see if it catches back on, but definitely something for those days when we have a large group.

Unfortunately 3 of my core guys from my gaming group HATED it with a passion, so had to trade it away...

RATING: 4
Initial thoughts:

Fast-paced, hectic, almost frantic dice rolling that gets tiring after awhile. It's too much dice rolling for me.

I can see how with more experience the duels would get more interesting. Initially it just seems like one side is chasing the other around the board and hopeing to get the right dice at the right time. But in time, I think the players can learn to be slightly more strategic in the use of the various abilities (tractor, warp, etc). Still too much randomness from all the dice rolling though.

I am not a fan of certain real time computer games (C&C or Warcraft or the Age of series for example - oof,  showing my age) and this game feels like it aproximates that in a boardgame format.

In the right mood and with the right group I would play it again but the franticness puts me off.

It's team-based dice rolling and... well, I guess to accomplish your objectives.  I played 4v4 and can only imagine how much *MORE* frantic it is with fewer players.  I was on engines so I rolled the dice to start.  Then I pass 'em to my teammates to roll their dice.  They return the white ones and repeat.  All the while I'm shouting at my commander "What do we need??!?  WHAT DO WE NEED?!?!?"  We each had a small piece of the overall picture that our commander was trying to manage in order for us to win.

Which is fine except I was a cog in the larger machine and had very little concept of what was going on beyond "WE NEED MORE 1'S!!!"  *roll dice furiously keeping ones*  Etc.

It's... fun but very frantic.

I had high hopes for this game, and I enjoyed my plays of it, but I don't think I'll seek it out often. There were a couple of times in each game where our two ships just sat there firing back and forth at one another, competing to roll sensors and torpedos. It's possible that with 6, we'd have somone completing the helm, but with 4, we were so frantic just trying to put our shields up while attacking that we didn't fly around much.

I think Escape does the simultaneous action frantic dice rolling thing a little better.

RATING: 7.5
Wow, it is a great game and a lot of fun, fast and easy. It is a very noisy and frenetic game so probably it won't fit everyone's taste. But I think this game brings a lot of inovations in the way it is played, without turns, it really is a real time strategy game where you have to make a good planing in real time before the enemy does.

Played with 8 people and in my game I was a captain, I thought it wouldn't be fun at all to be Captain but this game needs someone to look at the oponents and coordinate the energy distribuction and make some tatical choices, very fun and interesting.

RATING: 5
Maybe if you practiced a lot, you could get good at running the game. The first time out or anytime you have a random pickup group, though, things are liable to be so disordered that it feels like the winning team is based more on which team accidentally made the right choice the most times, in a sea of wrong choices and stalling fits.

And, overall, I don't know that rolling dice like a maniac and putting them where someone else told you to put them is all that thrilling a mechanism.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Truly awful random mess of a game. Real time play is still a fairly novel concept but with a number of players controlling one ship it becomes more chaotic not less. This might be appealing to some but to me it means you have a game devoid of strategy and reduced to quick responses - so why not play a video game instead?

RATING: 7
Very silly, but lots of fun. The fact that there are occasional breaks in the frenetic action to catch your breath is good. Surprisingly few timing conflicts for a realtime game, if played with my movement fix (you don't need to move immediately, movement doesn't stop play, but you must say "MOVING", and your ship is considered to be where it is until you do, at the new location afterwards.

For many years I've been going back and forth as to which game in my collection I think has the most sheer 'fun' factor.  Space Cadets Dice Duel might finally put the debate to rest.  While I think the game needs a little more depth (which is coming from announced expansions) to truly rank above 9, I will still play this game anywhere, anytime I can, without hesitation, knowing I will have a blast.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A bad game that shouldn't be produced at this beta state. Some good ideas cannot save the game. It also fails to adapt to either gamer or nongamer crowds. For gamers it's too shallow and for nongamers it lasts too long for a party game.
 
The game is a deterministic starship battle reminiscent of Star trek. The decisive factor from breaking the determinism is the continuous dice rolling in order to commit result you need. If you play it as a deterministic game with 2 players by changing the results at will, you can see that the game is broken by itself. Even with the dice added there are too many stand offs if one side plays even a remotely defensive game. 
With a captain added the role of the other players is demoted to dice rolling drones.


I didn't have fun on our first game though we won. Combined with the things that i didn't like it is a game i likely won't play again.

The basic premise is great, game flow is good when you have a gamer group. Occasional ruling mistakes are made often as dice get passed around the table. Especially helm players feel confused at the beginning. However, the game is so much fun when all hell breaks loose and players start screaming at each other.

In my opinion, tractor beam feature feels like an expansion. I need an experienced group before I introduce tractor beam.

I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME.
It's so absurd and ridiculous. It unfortunately almost never hits the table though because of the player number requirements. You HAVE to have two teams of equal numbered players, minimum 4 per team, ideally 5 so that means it can only be played with eight or ten players.

I want to play this more, it's a fun rush. In some cases you do need to pick positions carefully, though- people may enjoy it or not depending on how suitable their post is to their personality. Make people who get stressed out something straightforward (like weapons or engineering) and people who want more things to do captains.

If you were to score games with a mark that was calculated by price divided by time spent playing then this would score quite low, and something like Napoleon's Triumph which seems to take about a week would score very high, but I'd much rather have this.
I've just played my first game during a long weekend of gaming and this proved to be a joyous interlude. There were four of us on each team and it was an exhilarating 20 minutes of shouting (there's nothing quite like hearing the other captain order "Fire 1" and then noticing that your jamming is under-strength and your shields facing the wrong way).
In any large enough group of players I think one person should have this, there will be times when nothing else will do.

A fantastical and frantic real time dice roller.  One of the best team experiences out there.  Light years ahead of Escape.  

Needs a big group to play properly but a wonderful game when it all comes together.

First Impression: A worthy successor to the Space Cadets cooperative game. This is a great team game where everyone plays a vital role on the team. The head-to-head nature of the game tickles that competitive itch for me. Luck doesn't feel as if it plays a large part in this game because the main resource, time, is restricted by your opponents. The mechanisms fit perfectly with the theme of this game. I suspect that this game plays even better with larger teams.

Very fun, high stress, real time dice rolling game. Everyone I have ever played with enjoyed this game, but I could see why one wouldn't enjoy it. There is a lot of pressure, shouting and frantic dice rolling- it's not for a casual gamer. Also, I would only ever want to play this with 8 people. Maybe 6, but not 7, 9, or 4. only 8. That's not a problem for me, but that could be an issue for some people. Hence, I give Space Cadets: Dice Duel a 7.

I like this idea, but it's a little too chaotic for now. In a fully cooperative game, you can teach while you play, but this game is competitive. Still, rolling dice as fast as you can is fun, as is shouting "Fire!" randomly. A bit of a runaway leader problem, but it seems pretty thematic. At least you aren't forced to play past 50% damage: that would be kind of sad, as you roll your one energy die just hoping to stay alive...

RATING: 7
Juego de habilidad. Se enfrentan dos equipos.. y en cada equipo, hay varias cosas de qué ocuparse. Uno controla la nave, otro puede apuntar y evitar ser apuntado, otro controla la dirección de la nave, otro prepara los torpedos y hay uno, el capitán, que se encarga de distribuir dados de energía para que cada uno pueda hacer su labor.

Es un cachondeo. El juego se hace tirando todos dados, hasta que alguien para el juego para hacer un disparo... entonces, todos paran y se mira a ver que pasa.

La nave que sobreviva, gana la partida. Está entretenido. Suele llamar la atención de los q no están jugando, porque es vistoso ver a toda la gente tirando dados como locos. :)

Lo he probado en dos grupos de tres. No sé cómo funcionaría a otros números.

Games a blast but it is very group dependent.  Euro/strategy gamers will not enjoy this and it will affect the mood of others playing.  It's best when everyone at the table is cheering and frantic and engaged with the mechanics.

While it's not a deep game, it's a fun game and the fact that we played 6 times in one night shows how much fun it can be.

By the way, I highly recommend you try to get 8 and play the game with Captains, it works very well and is much more organized/strategic.  It is good with 6, but playing with 8 is like a step up.

You roll dice over and over again. And over again. I played the engineering role the one time I played, and I rolled dice over and over again. I didn't look at the board all that much. I really just tried to hand the other players the dice they needed in order to set up shots, move, defend, and acquire gems. For which I relied a lot on what they said they needed. Did I mention rolling dice? Often? Lots of dice rolling. I'm sure if I really really enjoyed the physical act of rolling dice, I would enjoy this game. But rolling dice is usually a means to an end for me, not an end in and of itself. 

If I'm going to roll dice frantically, I'll play Escape every day of the week over this. At least in that one I feel like I'm rolling the dice with a purpose in mind.

Though they're mechanically different as can be, playing this, for me, was a VERY similar experience to playing Pit. It's just a lot of chaotic shouting. I think I like the idea of this game more than I like the actual experience. There's just so much stress.

There's a fair amount of strategy, despite all the chaos. But the strategy is mostly just in the hands of the two captains, and everyone else is just rolling and hoping to get the right thing, which sounds more boring that it is. I can say this game is utterly engaging, because it leaves you no choice but to engage.

I guess part of my issue with this game is it's SO fast-paced and hectic, that you almost never have time to sit back and feel good about a play you've made. And when you do, you're VERY aware that in this case a "good play" was just luckier rolls faster than your opponents.

My boyfriend made an interesting observation during our initial plays of this, which is that due to the nature of the game a lot of "You rolled that after I called it, that roll doesn't count!" and "No WE said it first!" kinds of things come up, which just results in people feeling frustrated at each other and it's not really fun to play a game that makes people mad at each other. This can be mitigated by setting up stringent rules around certain things, like calling time-outs, and this feels VERY necessary to keep things fun for everyone.

Game 1, I was ready to say I liked this more than the original game. But when we played a second game immediately after, I started to feel overwhelmed and balked at the thought of playing it again.

It's cool to have a game that supports so many that isn't strictly a party game. Specifically, I guess, it's cool that there's a TEAM game for so many. I'm just not sure high-stress games are For Me.

I would not play this without 6 or 8 people.  Its great when you have the people.  It is frantic like zombie 15 and that dice rolling temple game.  I find that frantic action game is not for everyone.  I also find that people who dont like one of these frantic action games done like the others.

Chaotic dice-rolling team game that needs a full player count. Players are so busy rolling dice, that they often lose focus on what is happening on the board.

Experience: The most tactical game I've ever played. An adept captain can guide the crew through some pretty fantastic and sneaky maneuvers.

SPACE CADETS: DICE DUEL
This is the game the original 'Space Cadets' should have been!  Easier to teach and play, and only takes about 30 minutes to complete.  We played a game with 10, and it was the wildest half hour I've had in a long time!

This game is so much fun trying to get the team to work together in a frantic pace in order to load weapons, charge shields, bring systems online to fire weapons and then manuver into range to shoot. Because each role is different, there's lots of teaching in this game but once it gets going, it's lots of fun.

RATING: 5
Played this with the minimum of 3 players per team. I found this to cause a lot of confusion, some players have difficulty tracking the various roles they need. Perhaps with more players it will be better. Interesting mechanics with the simultaneous play style, and the speed rolling. The chaos can be fun.

Very fun, but had to make some house rules to make it work better for us and limit the time it can take... the game claims thirty minutes.  Closer to infinity if you have two good teams, or two VERY BAD teams playing against each other!

This game is a lot of fun with a large group. 6-8 players optimally. It is a blast to play with a large rowdy group!I cannot see the game being very fun in any other type of group.. I think having each person doing 1-2 roles is perfect but if you were trying to play just a couple people doing multiple tasks kind of takes away the entire teamwork premise. I would only get this game if you have a large group to play with.

RATING: 7
We played our first game tonight, and I played helm (and tractor and shields). I liked the game overall, but I hated the helm position. Rolling dice to build up sensors or load torpedoes kind of makes sense to me, but the fact I have to use all 3 dice to move every time was not only frustrating but non-thematic. I can move 3-6 spaces forward and stop, but I can't move 1 space forward and stop? I know I can use the dice to move 1 space forward and turn around, move 1 space forward and turn around, and move 1 space forward and that has the net result of moving 1 space forward, but that (to me) is just stupid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Awesome game.  It is just really hard to find a group willing to play (at least for me).

RATING: 4
I'd summarize it as an arena style real time combat with dice. Despite that summary, the actual game play doesn't go down that way. Without a moderator, players themselves have to yell at each other and the other team in order to fire missles, pause combat and resolve damage.

Game is rather simple since the arena is a 2D grid with 90 degree facing rules. Some side options of using the tractor beam to pull crystals or opponents but those are not very interesting. Boils down to which team can select the best targeting and disrupting dice to make shots miss or hit. Shields don't seem to be a big factor as much as facing.

*sigh*   I was really hoping this would be a big hit.  Played it with a group of 6 fun people and it just fell flat.   The design is very clever, however.   The roles are well-defined and make sense.  The frantic dice rolling in real time didn't quite provide as much fun as I had hoped, and I also had that reaction to Escape.   Stopping the game to resolve missiles was a brilliant decision.   The game is harder to teach than it should be, with unnecessary symbols and unused sides of the dice that aren't clear.    The teenagers I saw playing it seemed to be having a blast, however, so I could be wrong about Dice Duel.

After playing again with 8 people, I've decided this is definitely a game for 8 or 10 people, with dedicated Captain roles.   It's so much better in that configuration.

RATING: 9
I still love this, but for those trying to gauge the game based on comments I will say it has little in common with other dice games. The dice are really just randomizer here to slow you from getting what you need, its not a game about choosing die results for the most part. Most of the players are not going to be making deep decisions most of the time, its a game about the table situation and the frantic atmosphere.

I played a very enjoyable (and stressful) game of this with some random folks at BGGcon. I don't know if it would be more or less enjoyable with people you know as at the end of my game I was able to walk away from the people who had just screamed at me to arm the torpedoes correctly. 

This is a team game pitting two teams against each other in which they have to roll dice to see if they can move and arm their ship faster than the other team.

It's a very fast paced game of dice rolling. I'm just not sure it's for me, but I'd play it at a party or something.

Played twice with a full complement of eight. This game is INSANELY FUN. Also terribly chaotic and nail-bitingly tense. The sort of game where you can fire your torpedo, have it miss due to jamming, then deploy a mine, move past your opponent, spin around and then tractor beam them into the mine. BOOM!

And you'll spend a lot of time shouting at Engineering: "Give me THREES!"

Afterwards we joked about playing something more relaxing, like Jungle Speed. Seriously, the most fun I've ever had in an eight player game.

I had the pleasure of playing Artemis for the first time at the designer of this game's home in his Artemis-dedicated room. It was one of the geek-coolest things I've ever done. 

Space Cadets: Dice Game is the second attempt at rendering an Artemis tabletop experience and, IMO, the more successful one. I found Space Cadets bloated in terms of rules for the light, fun experience it wants to be whereas SC: DG hits the note much better. It renders a chaotically fun "bridge of a spaceship" team experience with the right ratio of rules complexity to depth. The only catch is that I think you want 8 players to render the full experience (though 6 is probably doable). It's going to be shouty and crazy, and that's part of the fun. A good big group game.

A team experience using dice rolling and allocation followed by more dice rolling, with chaotic planning and point blank shooting. I don't know if I would play this regularly or even again.

Very clever idea - I like it a lot! And maybe if I played it more and got better it would be even more fun. The one downside (ok two): (1) It takes a while to explain. So many dice to go through! (2) It is surprisingly stressful to play. So far, every time I have played it I have thought "That was fun! Boy! Let's play it again, but not for a month or two, hm?"

If you have five other friends over, play this blasted game.  It's as frantic as Curse of the Temple with it's live dice rolling, but with team against team action, it's a proper Vs. game.  The only problem, and it's a biggie that pulled it down from 8, is when you don't have five other people around to play the game with you, because it's 'best' with no less than six.

fantastic! Everything you wanted Space Cadets OG to do this does but without the long play time and over complexity. Fast, Frantic, and Tense! The team Vs. team element is so much fun, it really delivers the enjoyment of a co-op but with high stakes that only a competitive game gives. The team aspect does however kinda introduce a issue with the game and though it is really more of a Non-issue it is something to note. They game really needs at least 6 players, yes it can be played with 4 but you loose a lot of what makes the game fun. Now i only see this as a down side for the reason that i can't get it played as much as i want, but on the other hand it is a positive. There are not a lot of games that can play 6-8 players that are not a traditional party game, so this really comes to the rescue when that player count shows up. All in all i highly recommend trying this out.

Very good game that I like a lot but be careful with the people you play with and how you introduce them to the game. What I do, normally, is take them to the basic rules, avoiding crystals, tractor beam station, advanced technology cards (or whatever it is called), etc. Once you're sure everybody understands how to play and, actually, do some strategy, then you can add "modules". You'll be tempted to play it right away with all the stuff as soon as you have an 8-people gaming group but make sure you don't rush it or you'll have a frustrating experience when you realize that the rest of your team is almost playing against you.

I imagine this might be fun if you play as the captain, but I wasn't so it was just rolling a bunch of dice again and again.

This game is an intense, 20 minute dice-fest that will leave you exhilarated and ready to play something else by the end of it. I am eager to try the full 8 player game where one player on each team serves as the captain and looks on.

RATING: 5
I was a bit underwhelmed but this one but it may be because we played a 6-player game, I feel that an 8 player game would be much better as I felt that I had too much to think about and wasn't able to concentrate on the board anywhere near as much as I would have liked.

RATING: 7
The Dice Duel version of Space Cadets fixes some of the bigger issues of the original. It still takes a while to teach, but at least games only run about thirty minutes. That means in the same time it takes to teach the original game and play a training mission, brand new players can play two games of Dice Duel.

On the flip side, it introduces a different problem: player count. It's a game that can really only be played by 4, 6, or 8 players. That is a very odd count for a game, one that is hard to play around.

If one can find an appropriate-sized group willing to listen, though, the game is an absolute blast. It's full of energy and crazy communications (as well as mis-communications). The competitive element makes it even more exhilarating that many other real-time games.

Really fun, crazy, fast game.  We cranked out 3 games in about an hour and a half, so 30 minutes is about right.  Lots laughs and shouts.  Not for the faint of heart or stick-in-the-mud type players.

Played with 4 players the first time around and I can see why 8 is optimal

Much better game than the previous Space Cadets, it has the same basic ideas but the execution is superior in Dice Duel. The playtime is just right so it doesn’t overstay its welcome. I love the custom dice, they are gorgeous. Teaching the game isn’t as quick as I would like but the rules are easy to grasp. 

For now, I think it is very fun and I suspect it can go up higher in my personal ratings. I want to play again soon and I will probably buy it.

After played it a couple of times, I still think it is a very novel design, however, my desire to play it and to bought it decreased. Playtime is very variable, in my last dogfight, both ships were very well defended so it went for a long time. When we finished that game, my friend said he had a headache :D.

I recently played Capitan Sonar and it is a better design of the same concept! Due to this, my desire to play Space Cadets: Dice Duel is low now and my new rating reflects that. I just love how Capitan Sonar doesn´t rely in luck to accomplish its goal.

Played twice with the full 8 players. 
On the first play-through, my team got beat pretty badly and I thought it would be difficult to get "balanced" teams. 
Next round we shuffled up the positions and it was a much closer outcome. We barely squeaked out a win by moving past the attacking ship and firing backwards (the only place they were lacking shields).
Great fun that is less chaotic then you would think once everyone settles into the rhythm of it.

Wins in this game seemed determined by the group that was most willing to fudge the rules for the new people in my plays. Most of all I really dislike the mine dropping/tractor beaming close combat rules. Why would mines be undefendable? They seem like an overpowered and simplistic strategy.  Otherwise I'm ok with the game. It does seem to lock up when one team has decided to go full jammers. I just don't see a way to balance it out. 

It definitely doesn't help that I'm not a fan of rolling dice and hoping for a specific result, which is essentially what this game amounts to. Here's what I want to do, and let's see if the dice let me. Not a formula I'm fond of.

very interesting game. Very thematic and very different based on each role you play. So if you are normal crew it is good game. But when commanding your ship it is exceptional and after several plays you will feel quite tired.

It is very tense.

RATING: 9
Frantic, chaotic, thematic and a lot of fun.

Everyone will have there own job or jobs as the crew of your spaceship battles the crew of another spaceship.  Only one ship can survive, it will probably be the one with the best teamwork and strategy, of course a little luck never hurt either.

Easy to learn and teach, and be prepared to draw a crowd because everyone will want to see what's going on in your gaming group when this hits the table.

I really, really enjoy this game. It has the best parts of cooperative, real-time, and dice games all in one package.

Because you play on teams, the game has cooperative elements without the downside of most co-op games: the Quarterback Syndrome. In most co-op games, the ideal strategy for "solving" the game is for the most experienced player to call the shots for all the other players. Dice Duel subverts this completely.

The game also scales nicely with the number of players, provided you have an even number of players. Even kids have done well in several roles. The pure excitement of going 4v4 in simulated space battle gets your heart rate up.

Great game!

Real time game in which players take different roles at a spaceship, what's not to like? It's more of an activity than a game, but whatever, I don't care: fun and unique.

Typical in-game situation:

- Shields: They've hit us! Shields are down!
- Captain: Engineering, divert energy to the engines! We need to move away from that ship!
- Engineering: Aye aye captain!
- Helm: Where are we headed?
- Captain: I don't care, just get us out of here!

If you think that's kind of cool you'll probably enjoy Space Cadets.

I ranked this game an 8, but here's the trick, it's an 8 for me.  That is, people will either hate or love this game.  How would you know if you love it or hate it?  It's pretty simple actually.

Would you enjoy being in a real time battle simulation against another star ship?  The Captain is giving orders, the crew is working frantically at their controls.  Every second counts and tactics mean everything.

If you found the description above exciting, you'll love the game.  If you thought it sounded stressful, you'll hate it.  I played a game with 8 people and I knew before the game who would love and who would hate it based on their personalities.  There's no gradient here.

I highly recommend it if you can find 5 other individuals besides yourself who would love that feeling.  The game says you can play with 4 players, but I can't imagine that's as much fun as 6 or 8.

Unfortunately, I only know two others who loved it like me out of group I play with, meaning I'll probably never get a chance to play again.

Frantic dice-rolling with some measure of communication and therefore strategy. Thematic richness has definitely gone down with the shift to a pure dice game, but players probably couldn't handle more complex mechanisms on top of the real-time dice-rolling. The pace can definitely lead to some players accidentally breaking rules, and there's usually nobody free to notice.

Space Cadets: Dice Duel – the "Team vs. Team, Real-time, Dice-Rolling Game of Starship Combat!" – pits two spaceships against one another in quick-paced combat. The players are divided into two teams, each team playing the crew of a ship and winning or losing together based on how well they perform. The game ends when one side destroys their opponent by causing four points of damage through torpedoes or mines. Each ship has six Bridge Stations:

•Engineering generates power for the other stations.
•Helm maneuvers the ship on the map. 
•Weapons loads the torpedo tubes to attack the enemy. 
•Sensors locks onto the enemy so torpedoes can hit, and uses jammers to stop the enemy from locking on. 
•Shields helps protect the ship from enemy torpedoes. 
•Tractor Beams can grab the powerful crystals, move the enemy ship on the map, and launch Mines.

Big fan of Stronghold Games, but this game was definitely not for me when I played the demo...

Ended up just cheating and placing the die as whats needed so I could make the game end quicker..

RATING: 6
I finally had a chance to play. Much better than the original game for the implementation of the concept. The fact that all stations use dice also makes the the game easier to learn.

The only thing I disliked is the one on one duel because you are running after each other. But there seems to be enough openness in the game system to allow various type of game play.

One suggestion is to have something where both players chase the same thing like a racing game for example.

I would not buy the game, but I cannot say that the experience was not interesting.

Space Cadets: Dice Duel was exactly what I wanted out of the game, frantic fun through lots of dice rolling. The Engelsteins and Stronghold Games have really put together a great game, and one that especially shines in a convention like environment. The game is easily to explain and play and during my demo we were up and running in about 15 minutes. The game takes about 10 minutes to play through and there will always screaming and yelling and high fives to go around. I had a ton of fun in my game and would not hesitate to pay another game if given the opportunity. That being said there is one problem with this game, and it is also the reason I did not purchase the game. I can not conceive of how this is even remotely fun with less than 6 people, and to really have fun I would imagine 8 is required. That is just such a large number of players that I cant imagine ever having that on a regular basis enough to require this as a purchase for my collection. Like I said, I would love to play this more, but with a player requirement so large it has no place in my personal collection.

SC Dice Duel is far superior to it's predecessor, Space Cadets, in the components department. This time around the card stock pieces and game board are much thicker. The dice are etched and top quality. I don't know how they pulled it off without licensing, but the ships are models of the Defiant from Star Trek Deep Space Nine (very cool). The box insert is still garbage just like the one from Space Cadets (literally - I promptly through it away).

The crazy adrenalin from the original game + the feeling of Escape BUT in a team vs team game! I love it, but I understand that the pressure of competition can be too harsh.

After only one play I love this game.  We played without the tractor beam as it was everyone's first game.  Note to anyone teaching the first time, if you play without tractor beam you should only play to 2 or 3 damage.

Definitely not my style of game. While there is some light tactics of e.g. loading to projectiles to do a quick double attack to have a guaranteed bypass of shields the second time around, this game is still way too chaotic. Also, if you get stuck in a corner it is a bit difficult to maneuver out if your opponent is nearby, since you will also have to spend a lot of time getting jammers up so you don't just die while trying to escape. Also, the die rolls to see if the shields work or not really suck. This game also (kind of) promotes runaway leader, as you lose dice as you take damage.

Yelling dice!

OK, so, the major selling points:

2) No turns. No AP. A reasonable house rule is "no gouging".
3) Dice dice dice. Nearly all of which are intuitive.

On the other hand, it's loud and crazy and high-pressure, and that's going to be a turn-off for a lot of people. But with the right group... I could play this all night long.

Excited about this. I like space cadets but found it too hard to teach to new players. As long as both teams have new players the first play experience for this game should be much better...

Have played this many times and my feelings are very mixed. It's exciting and my gaming group really likes it BUT its so stressful that it's not really fun.

Super fun team game with a frantic but not quite stressful pace, and I'm generally not a huge fan of speed games.  Teaching takes awhile, but each new player really only has to learn a small bit so it's not too overwhelming.  There are also enough fiddly rules to create some odd situations and potential issues with order resolution, but this have largely been addressed in the forums.  Overall, a great group game that delivers on what many hoped the original Space Cadets would provide.  Looking forward to future expansions.

Update:  After a few more plays of this with different groups, I'm not as thrilled with it.  Teaching is a bit of a chore, and the rules are just fiddly enough to get in the way at least a few times during each game.  Some plays have been really fun and some have been a total bust.  I don't like not being able to count on this for a consistently good experience.

Fast paced and chaotic game where teams are working together to defeat (usually torpedo) the other team. Each player on a team has a completely different roll, so you may be rolling dice, setting up the torpedoes, navigating the ship, etc. Communication is the key. Don't play this with anyone who's too serious or competitive.

I really enjoyed this game, but most of the people I played with didn't.  It seemed non-gamers didn't really understand the point of frantically rolling the dice over and over, and gamers would get frustrated at making mistakes.
To me, making mistakes is what this game is all about, and where the fun lies.  Can't take it too seriously.

I did have one extremely successful play, a 4 vs 4 player game.  Very tense, lots of shouting, and after the game was over, a lot of us stood around re-living the "story" of the game, and blaming each other (in good fun) for losing the battle or congratulating on making the pivotal moves.  However, that was one play out of many more.  If all the plays were like that, this would be one of my absolute favorite games.

This game is for 2 teams of 3 or 4 players (so best with 8) with each team controlling a space ship and trying to blast the opponent into dust. Each player is frantically rolling dice to carry out a space ship action (navigation, assemble torpedoes, tractor beam, shields etc.). There is a square based board on which the 2 space ships try to manoeuvre themselves to line up shots. The game is great fun with orders to fire sending torpedoes into the void as the opponent warps away.!

RATING: 7
Nice wacky real-time dice roller. It's like combining normal Space Cadets with the speed rolling of Escape: Curse of the Temple!

You need your captain to have at least a little idea of what's going on (I'd suggest you have the captain do Navigation in lower player counts). I'd also fancy trying this with more ships on a grand scale, but can't really justify owning another copy.

While I own this I can't justify owning Captain Sonar, which is a shame as I want to try that too!

Frentic, intense and fun are the best descriptors for this game. 

The main dice rolling mechanic is similar to that of Escape From the Temple, but the rest is very different.

It integrates the best qualities of cooperative play (no leader) into a highly competitive game. The tactic content is really high as soon as the ships get close. You have to constantly watch your teammates, coordinate with them, and never lose sight of what the opponent is doing. And, of course, never stop rolling!

I initially though there was not a lot of decission making involved... Totally false!

I would not catalogue this game as a filler, in spite of its duration. The feeling, the intensity and the entity of the game deserves better.

Up to now, I have played with 6 and 8 players. I like 6 more, but maybe it's because we have not found a proper identity for the captain yet, some defined functions and responsibilities... 

On the negative side, I'm not sure if it really works well with anything different than 6 players. Also, I'm concerned about replayability at long term.

I might increase my rating if my concerns turn out to be false.

[b]Space Cadets: Dice Duel[/b]

[i]This was the last game my daughter and I played at TotalCon, and it was an excellent way to end the con. This is by far the most fun I've had playing a real time game. It perfectly blends the chaos of real time while still offering a lot of tactical play. The components are beautiful, the dice are really nice. 

The reason I probably will not add this to my collection is because even though you can play up to 8 it is not a party/family game that you can teach to anyone. There is enough complexity in how everything works that I could not imagine bringing this out with my parents or extended family at a holiday get together, where as a game like [thing=155362][/thing] is so easy to teach I have been able to teach it to a lot of people.

I will happily play this game anytime I get the opportunity as long as it is with 6+ players.[/i]

We played this game at four and I fail to see how it is even a game. I'm not the biggest fan of dice, but I do play a lot of games with dice and love a lot of them, but this over does it. You just roll and roll till you get what you want and hope that you do it before the other team. You move your ship, load your guns and protect your ship all with dice. At four you can barely look at the board, maybe with 6 it would work better as one player if passing the dice and watching the board, but still, 4 of 6  players will just be rolling dice. Definitely not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game takes the roles and ship operation from Space Cadets, combines it with the frantic dice rolling of Escape, and puts it in a team versus team context.  The rules are a lot easier to understand than Space Cadets, which is definitely a good thing for a game of this weight.  I don't really enjoy this type of game, but I think it's a good game for what it is.

Upon reading the rules, I was pretty sure I'd like this game. Scratch that, when I heard about the concept, I was pretty sure this was for me. Two back-to-back plays confirmed this. I cannot wait to get Dice Duel back to the table. 

This combines everything I love about the original Space Cadets with the dice chucking madness of Escape: Curse of the Temple wrapping it all in a team v team starship battle exoskeleton of awesomeness.

This game fell flat for myself and my group.  Yes it's chaotic, yet it's entertaining, but is it worth teaching people?  Not at all.  Rules explanation easily took at least 20-30 minutes because when teaching 8 people how to play a game people may not listen or there could be a bunch of questions.  Also since everyone needs to understand everything about their job before it starts (since this is a real time game) the teaching process really drags.

Now there's Captain Sonar, and I haven't even touched the game yet, but it seems like a Space Cadet killer based off of the rules alone.  I haven't even looked at the rules yet but by just looking at reviews I feel like I can already teach the rules to everyone in under 10 minutes and it will be a more intense game with the "hide n seek" mechanic.

For repeat play this crushes Escape Curse of the Temple. A lot of explanation for new players but I dream of a time of teams competing in leagues. 

Playing to first hit, without tractor beams is probably a good suggestion for the first go. 

Alternatively, 3 hits with 2 to a team (Weapons+Sensors|Navigation) is ok as an intro.

Only played it once.  It is intense with the right players, but there's a lot going on, which will overwhelm people who don't like timed games.  A pain in the ass to teach, as well, because of the complexity, but if you can find people patient enough to understand how to play it, and the competitive nature doesn't chafe, you might enjoy it. 

Update: Pulled this out again, and was surprised at how well received it was by the group...apparently, I was dead on when it came to the "right players."  It was fun and intense.  There was much cheering and back slapping when it was all finished.  Improved score by 1 point.

This game I should like but I'm indifferent to it. I played the role of building torpedoes and shields. All I did was listen to the captain and not pay attention to anyone else.

The game did give the ambiance of a crew of Star Trek, but it didn't really feel like a game. All I did was frantic dice rolling to match symbols ... almost like a HABA kids' game.

Perhaps the game will be more entertaining with less players. Or if I took the role of the captain and was able to make interesting decisions.

I can't stress this enough- you REALLY need the right captain on your team to make this game fun, otherwise this is just an exercise in frustration. I usually like real time games, especially if they have a cooperative aspect to them, but I just can't handle someone shouting at me every second to change the strategy they just told me to pursue.  On second thought, maybe this game would be better with no captain at all...Either way, it will be a while before I challenge another cadet to a dice duel.

Have played this 3 or 4 times on a camping trip with a group of 5 to 8 kids.  Intense.

The 10 year-olds were up and running pretty quickly and could easily run their own ship after a single game.  Even a four year old could run the weapon & sensor stations with some coaching.

Very intense, lots of yelling, very fun.  I'm not sure I could play more than a few times in a row, though.  I get exhausted!

Edit: The game itself is great.  If I haven't played in a while, it's score is much higher, like probably an 8.  Unfortunately, I can't go more than a couple games in a row since I get so stressed out.  Maybe that will change as I play with more people.  Being the "captain" on a ship of children while people are shooting at and trying to make sure everyone had fun was pretty stressful!

I am inspired by this game, but I don't really like it as it stands.  Defense is too easy and missile attacks are too random.  That makes the game slower and luck-based rather than intense and skill-based.  Also, the rules overhead is a bit high for a real time game, and some of the rules are irrelevant (like mines).  And the timing rules are unsatisfying, especially with the formalism for counter attacking and priority when actions are called at the same time.  Too many ambiguities for a competitive real time game.

But it was still some fun, and makes me want to design a better version of the game.

Just a touch disappointed with this because it didn't fill that niche I was hoping it would. I usually have large groups of non-gamers over and I thought this would work as a great party game for 6 or 8 people with some decisions involved. I have a blast with it, but I find the rules to be just a little too complex for what it is, especially considering the real time nature of it. I have seen a number of people just have a hard time wrapping their heads around it. This would be great in large groups of gamers, though.

Kind of hectic and confusing first game, but I assume that's normal for this game. I can see it being enjoyable, but the players really need to understand the rules and enjoy the game. Add to that that it needs 6 to play and it's just not going to get much playtime, if any. A cool concept, and I enjoyed it, but just too hard to get a good game going.

I enjoyed this one quite a bit. I will admit it's similar to [b]Captain Sonar[/b] but it's messier and (probably) not as technically good. That said, [b]Space Cadets: Dice Duel[/b] is much more frantic, frenzied, and furious and it is all about constant movement, charging weapons and firing non-stop while [b]Captain Sonar[/b] is instead a tense cat-and-mouse game with deduction and patient plotting - therefore [b]Space Cadets: Dice Duel[/b] offers a slightly different experience and is worth owning too.

When I played this game, we called it quits after 45 minutes of furious die rolling with only one total hit between the two teams.  At that point we were all exhausted and long past having fun.  We had only continued so far because of a morbid desire to finish, which we ended up not doing anyway.

Based on many of the comments, I feel like we must of really missed something.  It seems like it is way to easy to avoid shots and way too easy to move away from one another.  As mentioned, we had only one hit in 45 minutes of play and that was from a well played tractor beam.

I honestly expected this to be a fairly quick game, 15 minutes tops.  That would be its niche.  Anything much longer and it really begins wearing out its welcome.  Despite the frequent and furious rolling, we didn't have much in the way of chaos on the board.  We were all fairly well in control.

Perhaps someday I'll figure out what went wrong and give it another go.  Maybe not.  There are enough die rolling games out there as it is. [06.25.2014]

More fun as an activity than a game. The rules are frustrating to teach, which leads to a lot of unintentional rule breaking during gameplay.
We had to create a house-rule of pausing for, "movement" since it was easy to dismiss flying through hazards without resolving them, but this lead to other convoluted scenarios that seem to need more house-rules to compensate.
However, it still manages to be a lot of fun as an activity despite being somewhat sloppy as a game.

RATING: 6
I like this game about as much as Space Cadets classic, which for me was just a diluted set of mini-games.  Dice duel does play much quicker though, which is where games this light belong in my opinion.

In dice duel players are rolling in real time to assign different values to different stations in order to close on and destroy the other team's ship as well as protect their own with shields, sensor jamming, etc.  Each game lasts only around 30 minutes and can be a fast paced, entertaining jaunt.  I would only want to play this occasionally though when that is all the time I have as games this light are only good for about 1, maximum 2 plays before I want something a little more challenging in my games.

The game has some problems related to people's sensibilities.  In a game I played as the engineer (who assigns dice to stations) my crew had issues both remembering to hand dice back and using multiple stations at a time.  As a crew member I had difficulty trying to discuss strategy with my team in real time.

All-in-all though an alright quick and light game for those filler periods.

We played without the tractor beams (which are kind of confusing) the first couple games just so we could get the hang of everything else. I'm kind of glad we did it that way. There is a lot going on all at once in this game. We also played with 3 on a team. That seemed to work pretty well and helped everyone learn the game a little quicker since we only had to focus on our own particular station(s). It wasn't overwhelming. It was, however, still fast and furious.

Tense, fast and very rewarding, this game is one of my favorites. It's real time and pretty stressful, but it's oh so cool to be a master of your station or to be barking orders as the captain.

Glad to have tried it.  Whilst the box says 4-8 players, at its core it's a game for 2 players and 6 monkeys. The play is frenetic (stressful) but I didn't find myself enjoying it the way I did Space Alert as there were no interesting decisions in the dice rolling process. 

What soured me further were the weird rules and cheap 'tactics' like bumping off the walls to turn around and then firing or dropping a mine in your hex and tractoring your opponent in and only they are affected. But of course if a ship drops a mine an opposing ship can't use its tractor beam to send the ship into the mine because ???. If you're going for absurd then don't stop half way.

The problem with competitive real time games is that they really need an adjudicator to watch and make sure people aren't cheating, intentionally or otherwise. And that really isn't fun to do.

Dice Duel throws a lot at the table, but not a lot of it stuck for us. Speed yahtzee with a spatial element (the board) was a little underwhelmig for all of us, even if Robert who taught it was great fun.

Played at BGGCON, the middle roll of passing out dice was pretty disappointing.  All you're doing is repeatedly rolling a handful of dice and handing them out to your team as they call out numbers.

It feels a lot like Team Space Alert, with a lot going on at once that a player has to manage.  I'm not a big fan of Space Alert.  Also, the rolling-until-you-get-what-you-want thing seems redundant, since all it does is create uncertainty when you and another player are rolling for the same thing.  I'm not wild about real-time, chaotic games, which is exactly what this is, with an added layer of stress that comes from being responsible for other players on your team.

I don't like realtime games that involve dice rolling.
I think it creates so much chaos that plays tend to cheat unwillingly. People always tell me to take it easy and see it as a fun party game, but I really don't like rolling the dice knowing that plays including me are to stressed to know that they are rolling a dice that is not in play for some reason. I think there are many other great realtime games that gives the chaotic feeling but does not use dice rolling and therefore there is not as great a risk of "cheating".

RATING: 6
This game is crazy and I love it. It plays in two teams with the players on each team splitting up different stations of a space ship control room. It is a real time dice rolling game where teams try to maneuver their space ship and get a shot on the other teams ship, until one is destroyed. However I have only played this with one other person knowing what is going on so its basically just the captain of each ship that is doing all of the work. I love it, but my dad knows it as "that game where every body is just yelling role, roll, roll, and then you yell 'firing!' and everything stops." I just would like to try playing where the stations are manned by people who can make there own decisions about what needs to happen at their station.

This game is a blast! Holy heck is it fun. I was happy enough to have the game's designer Geoff Engelstein teach me the game during a demo game at SPIEL '13. He's very entertaining to listen to, and teaches the game very well.

Space Cadet Dice Duels may move up to a perfect 10 with more plays, as I have yet to play with the Tractor Beams and other advanced rules. I look forward to many more plays.

Gameplay is engaging and I really enjoy the simultaneous turns but it just didn't work out for my game group

This is pretty fun.  Of course... I like the tension and chaos of real time games so I can see why people who don't won't care for playing this.  It is also pretty group dependent as the best teams will consist of people who not only know what their stations do... but how they interact with the other stations and the enemy ship and board.  But if you have two groups of folks that get into the game and have fun giving each other advice and yelling "FIRE TORPEDOES!!!" you can't help but have a good time.

A chaotic mix of dice rolling and strategic planning. I only recommend this if you have six or eight people playing. 

The games I've played are high-energy and stressful, but very rewarding when a plan you put into action succeeds. 

Warning: Some people will NOT like this game due to its stressful nature. If your game group is more relaxed, it is not for you.

I liked this one a lot, it is kind of a more interactive version of Dominion.  For a small company, production value is high.  I would say that there can be a "landslide" effect, as the player that wins more skirmishes gains cards that make it easier to win more skirmishes.

Like Dominion, but with an interactive element with the skirmish.  This is a fantastic game - my only complaint is that the game is a tad too short.  There are only fifteen rounds and then it's over.

RATING: 6
There's something to be said for a deck builder having only a small set of cards. In Dominion you never play the same game twice which creates games that are more about finding cool card combos than interacting with your opponents. 

In Arctic Scavengers players can quickly move past the "how do these cards work together" phase. The trick to doing well then comes down to making sure you use your cards better than your opponents do. Now we are talking player interaction not card analysis. On top of this add a skirmish round where you blind bid for even more powerful cards.

The Junk Pile and Skirmish decks add a sense of adventure and exploration that works well with the subject matter making for a rather interesting and even harrowing thematic experience. Don't get too attached to every little refugee. Sometimes you have to turn them out in the middle of winter for the greater good of the tribe. Alternately you can use the included expansion which allows you to eat those who don't pull their weight or even harvest their organs. That's better then just letting them freeze to death, right?

This game is a thematic deck builder with some cool mechanics and bluffing.  The fight over the loot can get pretty cumbersome with all the tools and snipers, but it's still pretty fun.

An enjoyable deck-builder which is nonetheless ANOTHER re-working of Dominion. The small twist here is that players hold back cards from their hand for a blind-bidding phase to claim a powerful card at the end of each round. Otherwise, it is pretty much Dominion all the way, with only minor tweaks. It really feels like a Dominion variant, rather than a complete new game, but the theme fits well here - scavenging is a good concept for a deck-builder. Ultimately, the subject-matter is a little dark and brutal for my tastes: snipers, suicide bombers, refugees, grenades. But I had fun.

It's a good game that uses deck-building as the mechanic. I wouldn't say it's that good of a deck-builder though, since you can't cull cards as easily (only real way is to use Engineer to build buildings). So those who love finding amazing combos in say, Dominion, probably won't like this game very much since you can't do it. On its own, it's a good game, although I have some concerns about replayability. It's also a bit on the long side for what it is.

RATING: 6
Decent with 2 players but better with more.  I don't see this as having as much replayability as Dominion+expansions, but this has better price point and is a good intro to deckbuilders.

2 player play allows for sandbagging and negative play, whereas higher play counts reduce the impact of "take that" and stall tactics.

Ended up trading this on, as it was best with 3+ players but not as exciting as Clank or other games I have.  Still a good deckbuilder, but felt a little basic and limited by the number of cards available.  Not as much variety as Dominion (and a fraction of the price) but wasn't something I felt like I needed to keep.

Game gets frustrating at about 2/3rd of the way through.  At that point digging is basically useless.  Also if you don't get a med, you're dead.  Absolutely nothing you can do if the cards are against you.  Also way too much kingmaking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like [GAMEID=36218] in many respects.  Deck construction, drawing & discarding cards, shuffling.  Notwithstanding the similarities, this one plays out *MUCH* differently.  There are more choices to make and no combos to pursue.  Instead of the deck being the sole source of randomness, the junkyard and contested resources provide additional randomness.

I like the increased number of choices.  Do I dig or save my cards for the fight?  Which mercenary do I recruit this turn?  Do I want to fight for the contested resource?  Do I use this card for drawing or fighting, and this one for digging or hunting or fighting?

If [GAMEID=36218] weren't already here and enjoyed, I'd probably like this game a lot more.  As it is, it looks and smells like a sub-par Dominion clone.  In reality, it plays out very differently and I suspect most people won't give this one the shot it deserves.

On the flip side, the price is too high.  No wide release (afaik) and currently available from the publisher (Driftwood Games) for a [i]sale[/i] price of $25.95 (retails for $29.95).  [b]That. Is. Insane.[/b]  For $31.47 (discounted from retail of $44.95) I can get [GAMEID=36218] with 500 cards, or for $25.95 I can get this one with... 143 cards?!??!  Yeah, that's a tough decision.  This thing should be retailing for $19.99 [i]tops[/i] and preferably closer to $14.95.  At that price range, I *might* consider buying this.  But at $25.95?  No way José.

(Normally I don't comment on price, but with the inherent [GAMEID=36218] comparison I can't help myself.  [GAMEID=36218] is popular and well-known enough that it becomes the baseline.  Small publisher notwithstanding, I just can't get behind this one for $25.95-$29.99.)

In summary, a nice little game, but too expensive.  With a wider release and a lower price point, it might find its niche (and that's the only way it could survive/compete with [GAMEID=36218] in the picture).  As it is, I don't think it will make much of a splash.

ADDENDUM:  My above comments were made about the original 2009 edition.  It sounds like some of the issues are addressed in the new Rio Grande 2013 edition.  I might have to pick this one up now.

RATING: 6.5
Nice deckbuilder with some unique features. It sure is one of the best I've played (although not close to Dominion) and I would certainly want to try it again. I did get a feeling that the winning of cards at the end of the round can get a bit unbalancing since the more powerful player will likely get more powerful cards, but then again, it's quite a short game and it possibly evens out more with more players (I played with 2).

RATING: 8
Deck builder with player confrontation and bluffing every round. The deck building elements are pretty simple, but the contested resource element adds a nice layer of strategy. Every turn is a very tough choice of whether to send out your troops to gather resources and recruit basic units, or risk your turn to get the contested resource.

Haven't played with all the expansions yet, but the core game is compelling enough for me to score it an 8.

My score is a touch unfair, as I'm rating it as a two player experience only. 

However, I cannot speak to whether my issues are alleviated with a larger group. I can only hope. 

Pros? Nice theme, cool spin on the Dominion mechanisms (equipping cards to go out and work for you). 

Cons? End round conflict feels hollow with two (or perhaps it just feels hollow?). Limited card variability. Somewhat bleak.

RATING: 6
A game that takes the basics of deckbuilding from Dominion and adds some strong, dark thematic elements.  We are the remnants of humanity scavenging for weapons, food and technology and trying to build our tribe in a post-apocalyptic winter.  There is a junkyard deck to scavenge through, there are specialists to be hired and weaker members of the community to be cast out into the wastes or, um, recycled.  Most significantly, each round the players commit cards to a skirmish over what's often a high value card (only one player knows its true value, introducing potential for bluffing).  These elements combine to make Arctic Scavengers feel a less abstract optimisation exercise than most deckbuilders.  I like that.

On the downside, I'm not sure that I would play any differently in my next game.  Building a force to win those skirmishes seems critical.  There don't appear many ways to go about that, beyond standard deck thinning and churning techniques.   Arctic Scavengers is that rare game that cries out for an expansion to give it a bit more diversity. 

Production quality is up to Rio Grande's usual good standards.  The artwork is nicely bleak.

What's Good:
Deck builder with a good survival theme.
You can set aside cards for an end of round battle phase with other players.
Interesting expansion.

What's Not:
Only a select few strategies to win.
Need mostly meds but meds acquisition is based on random blind draw.
Victory point acquisition is random blind draw, you could get multiple families and have a huge point lead on other players in the end.

OK.  I enjoy Dominion.  So there's nothing to dislike about AS, as it’s virtually the same game.  Like D. you can still get duff hands.  There is the added fun of the end of round skirmish to differentiate the game, but not the variety which is the key to the success of Dominion.  As I have Dominion I don't feel the need to buy AS as well.  If I did own it, I'd probably play 20 games of Dominion with its variety and then a game of AS, as an occasional alternative.

RATING: 8
A decent deckbuilder with enough extra bits (and extra decision points!) to keep me more interested than Dominion.

The skirmish every turn ensures that you always have an important decision to make between playing cards for resources to buy a new card and keeping them back to win a potentially-better card. The end-game scoring ensures that you always have an important decision to make between discarding chaff from your deck and keeping it because even the default starting 'Refugee' cards are worth points at the end.

My main complaint is that there's a lot of cool parts of the game - like engineers and buildings - which barely ever come into effect because the game's own time limit sometimes makes it hard to actually buy the cards, use the cards and get the benefit in a meaningful way all in the same game.

An interesting variation of deck building, with a hidden bidding element (skirmish). A fun game, but nothing I would ask to play myself.
The deck building is fairly standard. The hidden bidding is interesting, but also very much dependent on your hand. Very often you just go all in on skirmish, because your hand is of no use for anything else.
The kind of dislike the waste pile mechanic. It can be very random.

Could be the game that starts to change my mind about deck builders. Better than Dominion for me in that the limitation of one of each action per turn (which stops chaining) and the fine balance between buying cards, trying pot luck for cards (digging for junk) and fighting for cards makes this more of a challenge in play and less an exercise in deck tuning. Instructions are awful though, for a game that should be very easy to explain.

This is a great combination of simple rules with complex decisions.  I was very impressed with the "finish" of this game.  There was only 1 card that caused us to turn to the rulebook for and it was neatly spelled out for us in the pre-thought-out FAQ.  I'm getting a little burned out on the Dominion archetype but this game is definitely worth my time.  With a bigger set of cards to play with the replayability will be much improved.  I'll definitely pick this one up once it is more widely available.

After more plays I think searching the junkyard for medicine is too critical to having a good game and very frustrating if you don't find it.

A similar mechanic to Dominion, except more thematic and seemingly more random.  Dominion feels like an engine-building game, identifying your options on the table and building a strategy as you play.  This feels like it has less to do with what cards you buy, and everyone appears to be doing similar things.

Probably more interesting than Dominion, but definitely less strategic.

I love the theme and the "fighting" mechanism which affords you to split between safely buying stuff you need and maybe getting random stuff you really want/need (due to victory points and usability).

Possibly my favorite deckbuilding game. Very easy to set up, gameplay is fast, and the mechanics are interactive, sometimes very tense, and thematically evocative. Each card makes sense according to the theme, and I love how the different decks vary in the number of beneficial cards they have depending on whether you are scavenging blindly or fighting over contested resources. The theme is awesome, and the artwork is great. Can't wait for the expansion!

Updated June 2015:  This is a keeper.  I have owned many deckbuilders (Dominion, Star Realms, Ascension, Thunderstone, Marvel Legendary, Thunderstone Advance, Bloodbowl, Eminent Domain, Puzzle Strike, Trains, Nightfall, Fantastiqa, and Quarriors to name a few.)  Each has its ups and down.  Some I hated (Nightfall), some I play regularly (Star Realms).  Most have been traded away.  It isn't the simplest nor the hardest to explain. This one stays though. Here are my reasons why:
1.  Relatively easy to explain.  Not as easy as dominion but its still pretty quick.
2.  One of the most thematic deckbuilders out there.  The mechanics match the theme well.
3.  Interactive.  The contested resources mechanic is brilliant.  It can actually be played with more than three people and not bore the crap out of you.
4.  It plays quickly.  It isn't super short but it does play quick.  
5.  Modular.  Has several expansions in the core box that add variety and make keep it fresh for a longer period of time.

2017 Update:  This game is still holding strong for me.  I've found it works well as a transitional game from gateway games to harder stuff.

I've been rather enjoying this. It doesn't have the obvious replayability of Thunderstone or Ascension - I wish the base set had been a bit bigger, with more different core cards - but still, this mixes up the deck-building formula again in interesting ways, not least making trashing cards from your deck trivial! The mix of skirmishing (essentially a blind bid), scavenging (digging for random equipment), and standard card acquisition is quite clever I thought, and the setting works. Anyway, like Cavemen and the Quest for Fire, this is a really nice mid-tier game: not a classic, but easy to play, teach, and learn; quick-playing; chaotic, but in a generally positive way; clever and unique in their genre; and with a believable topical tie-in. Nice. I liked this one better than Cavemen just because it plays a little faster and has a bit more variety, and deck-building is more inherently interesting than drafting.

It took way too long to get this game to the table.  For some reason I over complicated this game in my head.  When it came to playing it, you just throw everything in and it all just works off the bat.  You don't need to gear up towards the "full" game of this, it all just works together.  The theme of the game (IMO) really gels with the mechanics of the game.  Because of how you can play your cards it really feels like a limited post-apocalyptic landscape where you just have to scrabble for any meager resources.  I am huge fan of deck-builders and this has made it in to my top 10 deckbuilders of all time.

An interesting take on the deck builder.  Players work on building their decks from limited resources and searching the junk pile until the third round.  In the third round and beyond, players vie for better resources, setting aside cards to fight each other for these resources.

RATING: 7
I love Dominion, and most other deck builders I've played have felt like a lesser version to the original. Anything new added to the basic deck building mechanic felt a bit unnecessary.  (With the exception of Core Worlds, but that game just took too long).

So now, with Arctic Scavengers, I have another deck building game that I enjoyed very much. The skirmishes, where players essentially bid for some premium cards at the end, is pretty cool, and it forces players to weigh how to best use their cards. I dig it. With the base game now including expansion material, there's a lot to consider on any given turn.

Update: Ended up trading this one away. It's a good game... it's just that it was best tailored to my lunch crew, but we kept playing other options. I'd happily play it but the game just didn't have an audience.

The one thing I'll be curious about is replayability. Does this hold up over numerious plays? It's also more complex than I expected at first blush, and the rulebook could use some work. If people become familiar with the game though, I can see the playing time really picking up in pace.

What a pleasant surprise! Picked this up in The Works for just £9.99 and it's a delightful little deck builder that I'm sure will be an absolute blast in four player. Only two test runs so far but looking forward to getting it to the table soon.

UPDATE: Played with four players recently, thoroughly enjoyed by everyone taking part. Hopefully we'll get the expansions involved next time.

Solid, but uninteresting deck builder. The base set has limited sets of cards that make games repetitive. It has some unique mechanisms (contested cards, buildings et al), but nothing that would make me seek to play it again. I found the iconography difficult to process, I'd rather play Dominion.

Will likely not play this again, not for me.

I really like this one!  Some people will compare it to Dominion, but post apocalyptic arctic survival is much cooler (hah!) than yet another game of developing the kingdom... and frankly, it's a better game mechanically overall.  You owe it to yourself to give this one a try... it might be a little too random and a little light in general, but it's quite good.

R's. Stranded in the arctic, one tries to create the most powerful tribe with the best tools.  Each round, every player draws five cards from their own deck.  The round Initiator looks at the Contested Resource, then takes her turn.  The hand of cards may be used in four different actions in the order the player chooses: draw more cards, dig to find tools in the junk pile, hunt for food and use mess to attract another tribe member, or fight in the skirmish.  Skirmish cards are put aside.  After all players have done their actions, all skirmish cards are revealed.  The strongest fighter wins the contested resource.  Initiator passes to the next player to continue with a new round.  Rounds continue until the contested resources are depleted.

RATING: 6
A deckbuilder that I don't remember a ton about, other than it was much better than I initially thought. IIRC, you start out as a small tribe with very few resources and you need to try to get stronger by getting new weapons and things and eventually fight against the other tribes. I know there's a bluffing element to it as well but I can't recall what exactly. Unfortunately, there's only room for so many deckbuilders in my collection so I doubt this one will ever make it's way into mine, but I would definitely be happy to play it again if the opportunity presented itself.

A unique twist on the deckbuliding genre. The concepts are cool but the card pool is limited and there seems to be little replay value. Expansion does come in the box in the new edition but it doesn't have the wealth of cards that other deckbuilders have.

One fiddly part of the game is having to shuffle the junkyard deck after trashing cards.

Card quality decent, art is okay, theme is weird.

I don't normally rate after one session but this is head and shoulders above every deckbuilder I've played, and I've played a LOT. (Dominion, Ascension, Star Realms, etc.)

Check out the SUSD review if you're on the fence.

Will another deckbuilder ever achieve this level of cinematic story? 

Imagine a ragged Tribe Family stepping out into no-man's-land armed with a single shovel, where they are met by a heavily armed Field Crew bent on slaughter. But what's this? The crew's guns jam! Clearly the work of saboteurs, but they can still fight hand to hand. The question is, do they see the barrel of the sniper's rifle peeking out from the snow drift, back behind the family's line?

Edit: Dozens more plays confirm, AS is always great and Recon makes it even better. There is no other deck builder I even really like; this one I love.

Players are tribes of survivors, attempting to grow their tribe through hunting, scavenging, and recruiting.

Interesting deck building game.  Players each begin a round with five cards, and take turns to play out their hand, which may be one or more actions.  Actions require a personnel card to play, and these can be augmented by equipment to make the action stronger.  Actions include drawing off the deck, digging through a junk pile and keeping one card, recruiting new tribe members, and so on.

The quirk here is after the player has finished their turn, any unplayed cards are set face down for the "skirmish" - an end of round showdown for a strong card from a common deck of 14 resources.  

The game ends when the resource deck has been run through, and most people icons (i.e. tribe members) on cards in the deck wins.  

Solid, enjoyable deck builder - the mechanics feel fresh (considering this was the next deck builder after Dominion, and still one of the better ones, it's a great job).  Possibly a little thin in terms of card variety, but there is an expansion included in the box to toss in.  At the moment, very enjoyable.

Also - another poor Rio Grande rulebook - at least half a dozen errors in there - some serious.

I was originally worried this would be a Dominion knock-off, but it manages to borrow heavily from the Dominion mechanics and come up with something pretty unique.   You play out your hand to Draw, Dig (from a common junkyard pile), Hunt (Buy) other cards, and lastly Fight (blind bid for a contested resource where only one player secretly knows what the resource is).   It moves along quickly and intuitively.  The card play is more interesting than Dominion, but the buys less so.  With some more polish and more interesting cards added to the mix, this could go up a notch to an 8.

It is fairly clear to me now that I just don't dig deck builders. This one however gets a 7 on its theme. The survivalist nature of it really appeals to me even if my habit of making impulse decisions early that i later regret does not. Mechanically it is pretty similar to dominion but with a fair amount more randomness. There are three random decks you can draw from in the middle that create a fair amount of unknowns. Also it has a combat round which is basically an auction. Its fairly tense and it feels bleak which is good.

Probably some of the best theme integration I've ever seen.  It really feels like you're scavenging around for equipment and fighting over resources.  I really like how the game has an action system, but you never have "wasted" cards like in other deckbuilders.  I enjoyed my one play, but I'm dubious of how much the game varies between plays.  It seems like with the same market every time, every game will follow the same pattern of "get money then trash it for fighting".

Good deckbuilder design, with a lot of orginal ideas.  Plays pretty fast as turns are quicker than say Dominion.  I really like the contest player interaction phase, and the theme is pretty original (though bleak art and dystopic).  I don't think it's as 'flexible' or variable as Dominion and I'm not convinced some of the expansions mesh well together (as per designer).  I like the HQ expansion leaders which allow variable player powers and also the snipers and saboteurs to interfere with someone's turn, however Dominion usually offers multiple ways to win, whereas a bad hand or two here, in n a key contest round could cost you the game.

Although I've often thought about selling Arctic Scavengers, but when I go back and play it again, I enjoy it and have fun. So I recommend this game for a very interesting take on the genre by the second DB game ever published!  Better 3-4 player game than two and shame about the card's black borders.

This game sometimes makes me uncomfortable. It is incredibly brutal, but if you can get passed that, the game is enormously thematic. I've never played such a gritty game, and not sure I would want to. Morally, I find it troubling; abandoning your refugees in the junk yard, or playing as the fanatic and turning refugees into a suicide squad; but as an emotionless gaming machine, I can have a lot of fun. Unlike other deck builders, you can only hire (buy) 1 card per turn, and must venture into the junk yard and/or dedicate cards to the skirmish to acquire more. With your limited hand, balancing and choosing between these three methods make for very interesting decisions. Despite the rather shallow card pool, the various leaders incentivize players to experiment with different strategies, and help keep the game from gathering dust.

A nice take on deck-building.  But there are limited paths to victory it seems.  You need to get 'meds' to get the better cards, but obtaining those is from a random draw.  If you get shut out of meds it's tough to win.  Seems like a basic design decision that should have gone in a different direction.

Haven't played this in several years, but I remember liking it for the way you decide to use or not use your cards each turn. You need to hold some back if you want to compete for the item available at the end of each turn (usually worth it). This wrinkle means far less hands play themselves as compared to Dominion, and I liked the decision point.  But then they added an element of uncertainty with digging through a pile of cards which can randomly make or break you.

Word is there's an expansion in the works to offer people new cards to keep things fresh. Dominion certainly has it over AS in that regard as this could use more cards.

Best theme to mechanics example I can think of in a game, especially a deck builder. Unfortunately, Arctic Scavengers' gameplay isn't as strong as some of the more recent deck builders like Clank! and Tyrants of the Underdark. Furthermore, the game could use some streamlining when it comes to using the included expansions in the game, which are more-or-less necessary to add any sort of longevity to the game, and the game ultimately is not fun at the 2-player count.

Arctic Scavengers is a rare deckbuilder. The strategy isn't so much about getting the right cards into your hand as making the most efficient use of what you have while reacting to what opponents are doing. It's very easy to teach, the graphics are top notch and very atmospheric, and you can reliably finish a game in an hour or so. I love this game. My favorite deckbuilder.

By concept, this is my favorite game in a genre of "deck-builders"; I've only really played one other, Dominion, but I don't like the more popular ones by their vice of being cooperative.

Frankly, I'm not very good at this game, and perhaps that dulls my opinion of it. I'll play it with any player, but constantly playing with new players makes the game drag, and that can be frustrating, too. If the game is clipping along, I find it to be very enjoyable. I particularly enjoy how this game mechanically differs itself from Dominion: the multiple resources (food & medicine), the blind auction at the end of every round for a power item (skirmish), and variable capabilities of most cards but the ability to choose only one. 

I'll play this game every time it's brought up, but I'm rather internally reluctant when there are new players involved.

Thematic deck building game with lots of interesting and innovative mechanics including a bluffing mechanic that means there is lots of player interaction in this one, lack of which is one of my major complaints with most deckbuilders. 

Really nice deck building game where there is a common pile of shuffled cards that you can dig through to maybe find something interesting. There are two resources for purchasing a card and then once you have spent all the cards you wish then you put the rest of the cards into a fight over a shuffled pile of contested cards. These contested cards swing quite wildly in the power levels with some cards worth 5vp but actually contributing nothing but vp to your deck, others boost your card draw or fighting ability but are worth less vp. 

I also like that the first player each round gets to peek at the top card of this deck thus they have an idea how much to commit to the fight.

The base game also comes with 4 expansion modules so there will be a lot of replayability here and it plays reasonable quickly, so I expect this to get quite a few plays.

I've only played the basic game as a 2P game. Seems to be an obvious deck-builder. Does nothing new or exciting, but it's a solid game. Fairly obvious choices since you can only deal with what's in your hand. Somewhat solitaire but I though that of Dominion until I got some plays under my belt. Amazed at how many typos/rules errors there were in the rule book.

So I enjoyed and will play again.

Played 1 time with 3 players.

2010 JAN 21 - A lot like Dominion, only it eliminates some of the things I thought was boring about Dominion without expansions (the repetitious early game and plainness of tactics) and added things that I thought really worked, like a theme, player interaction, and bluffing. The theme was an interesting idea and I might have liked it if the artwork had been better, but for a smal publisher, high marks. If they can price this lower than Dominion and have lots of expansions, I will gladly pick this one up.

2013 AUG 30 - Revising ratings, I since come to love Dominion, and this game has fallen in comparison. Not as elegant, limited theme appeal.

While it follows the basic model of many other deck-builders, the inter-player fight round for the more prized resources and the strength of the theme gives it a very different feel.   The bluffing potential adds a nice twist.   I'd recommend playing with gangs and medics.   Leaders are interesting in their own way, but many of them take away the tough decisions about discarding or holding refugees.

Disclaimer: I am biased since I designed this game. :-)

Commentary: This is an excellent game to play with 2-5 people in between more extended and time intensive games.  It provides for some interesting player interaction through bluffing and allows for players to take various strategies to win.  I'm always up for a game or two as part of a larger game night or an all day convention.

My Rating: I believe in this game and I have seen first-hand after months of playtesting that it provides a compelling combination of strategy, entertainment, and group interaction.  The decisions are interesting and fun. After you get comfortable with the game it moves pretty quickly and the bluffing element is great.  I am sure that the game has it's weaknesses and I am sensitive to the fact that designers tend to see the best in their games, but I truly believe in this game and have seen the energy people develop around playing it.

Rating based on eight plays - a truly interesting, fun to play card game! The deck building of a Dominion,  Get new cards by "hunting" - both personnel and items that augment the personnel.  Get items in the "junk yard" by "digging."  Trash a card in the junk yard that has served its purpose, or lacks a purpose.  Set aside cards to "skirmish" other opponents to get the "contested resource."  Win the game with the largest tribe.

Decent cards, nice art for a self-published game.  Robert Gabhart has done an admirable job creating and publishing this useful contribution to the hobby.

I loved the concept when I first heard about it, but feel very let down by the actual gameplay.
First, you need to play with the included expansion that adds medics. Without them, the base game has the possibility of being "broken" if one players gets meds and another player does not.
Second, the variety in cards is quite weak, and will never change. This is certainly the least varied deckbuilder I have ever played.
The innovation of keeping some cards in hand to fight over a central card is interesting, but with some central cards being terrible and some being amazing it's more unbalancing that cool in practice.

An earlier deckbuiding game with all of the essentials of the genre. More confrontational than my favorite, Thunderstone, because of head-to-head combat. However, you aren't punished for losing skirmishes as much as you're rewarded for winning them. The grimy artwork conveys the post-apocalyptic setting. Item cards have realistic, multiple uses. For example, a shovel is better for digging while a pick axe is better for fighting, yet both can do the same job. Smart!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A deck-builder with tons of theme! Can be a tense game with a big dose of bluffing. I worry a little about the replayability since the each game features the same cards and so what's to prevent you from using the same strategy each game (though the unique abilities of the tribe leaders sort of mitigate that a bit)? But I realized it's a bit like poker. Same cards every game but wildly different based on bluffs and the strength of hands and the luck of the draw.

Anyway, we're enjoying it quite a bit right now. Not especially great with only 2 players, however.

RATING: 7.5
An interesting deckbuilder with fantastic theme/mechanism intergration. Unfortunately, the game falls short as far as depth goes - something I really wish was there, because the framework for this game is AWESOME. My main complaint is that the cards really just aren't special. One might give you +1 hunt and +1 dig. Another might give you +2 hunt. Which one do you take? In my several plays I have found it never really mattered. At the end of the game, the decks often feel unfocused and random. Which, in regards to theme, makes total sense. Arctic Scavengers makes me feel like I'm sporadically taking whatever I can get. It makes me feel like I'm struggling to survive yet - as far as mechanisms go - this isn't really my jam. 


Update: Played a quick test solo-game to see if I was wrong or not. One player slimmed their deck and focused on getting hunters/medics early and buying up all the thugs. They won straight up. There ??might?? be more to this than I thought.

Another update: I played a real 2-player game where I employed this strategy and won by about 11 points despite only winning 2-3 of the contested resources. I'm glad to see I wasn't completely wrong. I'll be holding on to this game for now with high hopes for the expansion :)

RATING: 6.5
This is a great game with a proven play mechanic (deck building).  The fact that Rio Grande has included the HQ expansion is why this game has received a 9, without the expansions this game is about a 6.5.  This game is easy to teach and plays well at 2 players through to 5.  This may just be a stand alone game though, after reviewing the proposed Deception expansion, I doubt that the game will survive further expansions.

After continued play of this game and enjoying a number of better deck builders, I find it necessary to drop the initial rating from 9 to a 6.5.   The Recon expansion may prove to be an improvement on this game, but at this time I'm not ready to jump on board until I see a number of glowing reviews.

RATING: 6
Arctic Scavengers is definitely one of the more engaging deck-builders on the market as the "brawl" at the end of each round provides incentives to buck deck optimization, to bluff, poke, and prod. While I don't think it will ever be my favorite deck-builder, it's certainly a worthwhile entry into the genre.

5 players is not advisable, way to much downtime.

The randomness of the treasure cards or whatever they're called can be off-putting for some.

May09: Only 1 play in, so rating is a little rough.

The game play is easy to pick up.  The rules are still a little rough in layout, but they work.  The cards are nice quality with a very usable layout and solid artwork.

Right now, there seem to be some interesting decisions.  Always being able to trash whatever you like from your hand makes for a challenging play.  You need to keep a nice balance between tools and people in your deck.  Most tools come from the Junk Yard and most People are hired as Mercs.  And then there's the challenge of just how much to join in the fighting.

It seems fun too.  Although I'm sure it would be better with more players.  The game time is going to scale pretty linear with the player count.  I imagine I'd like it best with 3-4 players.

The only worry I have is that there might not be that many different strategies.  It seems like the actual points come from the big mercs and the reward pile.  You can't ignore those and win, so it's down to two strategies at most.  Still, deciding how to slim down your deck and what to add to it each turn is interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I will edit my rating in the next few weeks, once I'll have played a few more games. Right now, I love the theme, I love the card illustrations and the mechanics. 

After more than ten games, I love it. But... the box... seriously, is there any quality control around? That's like the worst box I've seen in my entire gaming life. You need to cut the card dividers with scissors and, still, you can't close the box well. Ridiculous... 

+ Expansion box... which should have helped with having a box in which everything fits but... it doesn't. Or, am I missing something?

RATING: 7
My main problem with a lot of deckbuilders, in particular the ones that purport to be strategic games, is that often they're combo based and so they come down to luck of the draw in a frustrating way. Sometimes despite your best efforts your cards never come out right and you just never go off. And then if there's a big disparity here early then it becomes very hard to catch back up without even more bad luck going the other way. This can definitely happen in arctic scavengers, but for me it edges out something like dominion by just a bit in that it's a bit more fun and evocative. It can be fun to play the game even if you don't win, whereas for me Dominion is just about the winning in spite of the fact that it doesn't really work for me as a strategic game.

Meh...I really can't say anything terribly good or bad about the game. Definitely try it before you buy it, if you can.

RATING: 6
The one thing I will say about Arctic Scavengers is that anyone who complains that all deck-building games are the same and don't involve much player interaction will be pleased with what is here. Direct interaction is all but forced with players having the opportunity every round to play cards to directly attack one another and possibly win a prize (a special secret card to add to one's deck).

My impression, however, is that the game provides this at the sacrifice of a strong emphasis on engine building. Acquiring many of the game's cards via randomly drawing may be thematic, but it can be frustrating when trying to plan ahead.

There are some unique mechanics and it certainly doesn't play like every other deck-building game, but it hasn't hooked me in like my other favorite deck-builders have. I would like to play this game a few more times to see if the game can start to "click" for me.

Described to me as a Dominion-like game.  It seemed to me to be almost Dominion-for-Ameritrashers.  All it was missing was a bunch of dice.  It seemed like our five player game had not enough of the affordable cards, and we ended up with a runaway leader problem.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2014)

OK deck building game from Rio Grande, I was expecting something a bit better though. I really like the static market offering, but the game comes with too few cards, and every card plays in every game so I think the replayability factor is rather low and dominant strategies can appear quickly (having  a high fighting force for the skirmish comes to mind) . I think the game will feel samey very soon. It is very Dominion like, but Arctic Scavengers have a lot more player interaction. I like the skirmishes every round, it makes for some interesting decisions (should I play this card? Or reserve it for the fight?)  however there is a lot of luck in the reward cards, sometime they will be great, others not so much. However as the first player knows the reward card, it adds a bluffing aspect to the game and the luck can be mitigated. In contrast the junkyard has a lot more luck, and the only way to mitigate it is to play a lot of spades BUT it can be mitigated so it doesn’t bothers me much.

I played the game with 5 players and the downtime was excessive. I think the game is best with two players. I will play again with 3 players max, with more the game gets very slow for me.

Love Arctic Scavengers theme and art. 

Bottom line, I want to explore the game further, but I really feel the game needs a couple of expansions or all the plays can be very similar.

Current Rating: 6.0
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this game quite a bit.  It is more thematic than Dominion and I like the skirmish at the end of each round.  Let me reiterate, the theme is awesome.

The knock on this game in my book is the lack of high end cards.  You can get to a stage around round 10 or so where all the really useful mercs have been hired.  At that point, you pick up something just for VP sake and throw everything else into the skirmish....and get a grenade or some other tool with limited utility at that point of the game.  It is like a whole turn is wasted.  This can happen a couple of turns in a row.

If this game had more high end mercs worth more and more VP, there would continue to be that tough decision between the hiring and skirmish.  This game could easily become a 10.

Oh, and the best strategy is to always thin your deck early by dumping refugees.

Decent deck building game with more interaction than most. Streamlined turn sequence is a plus, in particular that you can only draw additional cards once per turn so no drawn-out turns while someone slowly cycles through half the Village cards a la Dominion.

yet another deck builder trying to do far too much at the once. there are too many different types of action and the actions are limited to once a turn, making drawing a 'good hand' objectively impossible. Limiting to only one buy each turn is pretty ridiculous as if you manage to eventually draw a hand with a strong buy power, you can only get one of those things. When I play a deck builder, my aim is to make a consistent deck, so I can have fun playing cards. This game is designed to make consistency impossible and has more 'feel bad' turns than any other deckbuilder i've player.

RATING: 7.5
Underrated and, unfortunately, under-supported deck building game. It's a shame that this was so delayed, as there are a couple of mechanisms present that, had this had wide release immediately after its design, would have propelled it into popularity and we might have seen some great expansions...

Standard deckbuilding tropes here, with multiple currencies, but it's the direct conflict for a contested resource each turn that sets it apart. Choosing whether to spend your hand on building your deck with standard cards, or committing them to the chance of acquiring a stronger contested resource, leads to some interesting thematic decisions. On top of that, setting aside cards that would be otherwise useless opens the door bluffing opportunities to tempt your opponents into wasting their otherwise useful cards in an attempt to best you...

It's truly a shame that we won't see where this game could have gone had it gotten the release it deserved.

An acceptable Dominion clone with some minor original ideas. The game has a fixed length and it's unfortunately way too long and repetitive. There's also a bad rich gets richer syndrome.

A lot of the incentive is put on the end-of-round showdown, which is a blind auction for a random, unknown result. Of course, the turn you go all in, it's going to be crap, and then the next turn, someone will get a huge boon from a tiny investment. The game's core is interesting, but the showdown wrecks it all up.

RATING: 7.5
I had higher hopes for this one but lack of variability and my groups disinterest on deck builders kinda killed it. The game is fine but there is a high amount of luck in it. You might have a lot of good survivor + item combos but if you draw them at the wrong time you might not even be able to use them. You might have good fighting cards and not draw them at right times and game might snowball out off control if one players keeps winning skirmishes. Also the game feels like it overstays its welcome for our group. Some positives are, the game is surely thematic. I like the different actions you can take and you can't keep drawing cards like in other deckbuilders since you can only do an action once on your turn. I think if people were more experienced then the game might be a lot better and I know that the Recon expansion fixes the variable setup element but I don't want to spend money on a game I don't play just so that it might make it better.

I am glad the expansion was included in the RGG box.  I think the standard game has a minor problem, where if a player is unlucky in his digs, and fails to find med kits or pills, a portion of the game can be shuttered to him.

With the HQ expansion, the Medic character is available from the start.  This ensures the advanced mercs are a viable path forward.

I really like this deck building game that actually has an interwoven theme!  This also has a fair bit of interaction with the battle at the end of each round for a contested resource that can be pretty special.  You must choose how to use your people, whether it be to draw more card(s) from your deck, search the junk pile, hunt to hire additional grunts, or fight.  Equipment enhances the ability of the different types of grunts.  It doesn't play quite as smoothly as Dominion however.  I didn't much care for the rule that the junkyard had to be shuffled every time cards were discarded there, but after playing it that way once, understand the purpose even if it is a pain in the arse - keeps a lot of junk in the pile the whole game!

Ein Deckbuilder. Ähnlich wie Dominin kann man mit seinen Karten aus der offenen Auslage Karten erwerben. Man kann aber auch von einem verdeckten Stapel ziehen (in dem auch Müllkarten enthalten sind) und am Ende sollte man noch Karten auf der Hand halten, denn wer dann am meissten Kampfkraft hat, erhält von einem weiteren Stapel wiederum eine Karte (die sehr gut sein kann). Am Ende werden die Siegpunkte (Männchen) gezählt, die auf den Karten sind und abgerechnet...
Ich mag Deckbuilder im Allgemeinen. Dass man Karten auf der Hand zurückhalten muss für einen Showdown fand ich anfangs ganz interressant... Man behält aber dann 3 Karten von seinen 5 zurück, macht nichts damit und wird von einem Mitspieler überboten. Das ist dann schon fies! Ansonsten fehlt mir auch mehr die Interaktion!

Arctic Scavengers is a well-balanced and easy to learn game.  This is a game to play with beer and nachos.  If you're looking for a wine and cigar game, play chess.  Arctic Scavengers is fun and fast.  It would be great at a small party, or in between other longer games.  I love that the mental challenge comes from the bluffing element between players and the choices I am forced to make - not the mental challenge of remembering 87 rules.

One of my favorite deck builders, Arctic Scavengers introduces two new mechanisms: a trash pile that you can dig in for random helpful items and an unknown item that everyone fights over at the end of each round. You can either choose to use your items in actions or bank them for the big fight at the end of the round. Whoever ends up with the biggest spears wins the loot.

This only makes it to the table every 6-9 months, but I enjoy it every time it does! We still haven't played the HQ expansion, but that'll come up at some point, I'm sure.

I guess I can see why Rio sat on this game for so long: It's not as light or as easy to learn as Dominion. The sad part is, it has some other things going on rather than just building your engine, such as the bidding at the end of each round of play. The digging is also a nice variable that, while it can harm a player's progress a bit, does add another element to the whole, making the package much more appealing in ways.

I actually think I would have liked it more if this wasn't my 12th deck builder or so; not that I'm tired of them honestly, I've just seen such a variety now that this is simply average rather than the fresh and unique it would have been years ago.

Deckbuilding game with an added element - cards left over from your turn are held onto for an end of round bidding/buying phase for a resource card face down in the center.  The only person who sees that card is the starting player for that round, so other players must infer how valuable it is based on what that player does on their turn.  Can have a bit of deception with it.  Not sure how variable the game is, though, might be all the same set of cards available every game.

Traded Puzzle Strike for it on here.  Worth the trade just to play a couple times and then trade away again, since it didn't really work with my group.

Sent it to someone Cody found who shipped Tzolkin to me from Amazon.

A deck builder with a great theme, a mix of common character stacks, with blind draw randomness via the junk pile.  Dominion meets Ascension in an Artic wasteland and everyone fights over who gets what.  

What it does, it does really well.  A very polished game.  Much better theme than Dominion, and the random element from the junk pile doesn't overshadow things - there were no game breaking items found.

Arctic Scavengers is a deck-building game that is mechanically very similar to Dominion.  Players attempt to hire various types of soldiers, medics, and other units to build up their decks.  They can find tools that can be used by these units to boost their stats.

The player can then use these units/tools to dig for survival artifacts (generally tools), purchase additional units, or combat other players for highly prized items from a deck or resources (high-value units or tools).

The game is simple but incredibly fun.  We've played it with quite a few different groups and all of them have thoroughly enjoyed it.

Deck builder that's supposed to be better than Dominion. Note from Reddit on 2 player: "
It's fine as a 2 player game, but it really needs 3-4 players to shine. Most notably, the blind-bidding skirmish at the end of each round is often very bland in a two-player game, where it is always super tense with more players.
For me, Dominion is a much better 2-player deck builder, whereas Arctic Scavengers is much more fun with 3-5 players. This sentiment is also somewhat reflected in the "recommended" and "best" player count votes in BGG."

Excellent thematic deck-builder. Plays well with two, but the skirmishes no doubt are more interesting and nuanced with three or more players.

The most thematic deck builder I have played so far. The decision making required is rich and interesting, which cannot be said for its rivals, and the various mechanisms such as digging in the Junkyard and preparing for the Skirmish work so well. 

AS is also a game that isn't multi-player solitaire as their is direct player interaction thanks to the Skirmish and several of the units. 

The included HQ expansion does just enough to add to the base game without getting too complicated. 

I can't wait to try the Recon expansion. 

This is better than Ascension and Star Realms for me but it does come at the cost of an extra 30 minutes play time. But for me the gameplay is well worth th3 50 minutes and I don't notice the time passing.

Can feel like a lot of work to build a functional deck, and while the mechanisms work well within the theme I find the theme itself somewhat off-putting, and just can't quite throw myself into it well enough to really care.  Perhaps more plays will increase my understanding of the different cards and phases, but for now it's a largely opaque deck-builder.

An interesting design.  You might say that rather than having a "buy currency" and a "fight currency," this game has "buy actions" and "fight actions."  It's nice to see a deckbuilding game that has such direct interaction and bluffing between players.

Fun deck-builder in desperate need of an expansion and more cards.  Included expansions are nice - and don't think I've scratched the surface on viable strategies.  Like that there's some direct conflict - but that it doesn't get too nasty.  May have a bit of a runaway leader problem with 2-players and contested resources.  I say that because I was on the losing end of most skirmishes and it makes me feel better to blame the game.

Deck builder about fighting for contested resources, with a minor bluffing component. It's too straightforward, with no alternatives to fighting for contested resources.

It features some though and cool decisions, but ultimately, it's just about winning those contested resources with a mostly-blind bet, and ultimately this limits its replayability.

RATING: 4
Somehow structured in a way that makes the gameplay feel very slow and filled with downtime. Combined with the fixed game length, and obvious rich-get-richer issues, this makes me feel like the game drags on forever. 

Rio Grande edition includes the HQ expansion: The buildings do not quite seem to fit in the mix, and the leaders are horribly unbalanced. Medics and rifles are useful additions, and the gangs are definitely needed for balancing the endgame.

Poor UI choices: Uses the same icon for both card type and action type (tools, pills), and buildings have some other information in the corner where the point values should be.

Nice little Dominion clone deck-builder that does something a bit different. At the end of each round, all cards not played by players that round are flipped and the player who reveals the highest fight total gets the juicy contested resource card to add to their deck. It's the normal draw 5, do actions with the cards you get, where the actions may be to draw more cards from your deck, draw-X-keep-1 from the junkyard pile or buy a card from one of the 8 centrally available decks. Cards themselves have values for each of these actions (plus the fight action), so they'll lead you in the direction to play each turn. The best fight cards usually have low VPs and vice versa. There are tool cards in the junkyard pile which give modifiers to the more normal people cards. It's simple, fresh, and the contested fight gives it a more enjoyable interactive flavour than Dominion. Where it falls down a little is that there's probably too much luck re what contested card you get (eg you get lots of VPs but a non-useful card in an early round, or a really useful card but with no VPs at the end when you really wanted VPs), and only the first player knows what you're fighting for and can easily bluff with a few dud fight cards. That's part of the fun though. It ends in the right amount of time. The limited card pool will probably limit long term playability somewhat, but there's still good fun in the meantime.

Dark game. I really like the theme. Unique deck builder where each round ends in a skirmish over which player will end up putting a cool "contested" card into their deck. Not too much learning curve.I like the art and the graphic design as well. 

Base game is painful, and really needs some of the HQ expansion modules from the start.

Not a great 2-player.

What I like:
- Quite a bit going on, with multiple currencies
- Pretty thematic
- The skirmish adds a nice twist to deck management
- There appear to be multiple ways to win
- The inspansions add a lot, and I like that they are optional

What I don't like:
- Skirmishes are basically an all-pay auction
- Too much of the game revolves around skirmishes (not enough recruits focus on hunting and points)
- 5p learning game ran 100 minutes, but 3p games since have run 60-70
- In my first game, luck of the draw seemed heavy, but it may have just been that game

This is more complex than most deck management games, so I think the weight is above the BGG-voted 2.2 (I would say 2.5). Having multiple currencies, and multiple actions but only being able to use each card for one of them is very clever.

You'd think I'd like this deckbuilder more because: deckbuilder.  But I found some aspects a little clunky and in the end, it just doesn't do anything particularly different or better to raise it above other deckbuilders in my estimation.  It also suffered until recently from a lack of variability in the cardset, although I hear this has been corrected in the reprint?

I'd play again if suggested, but won't be asking for it myself.

Not a big fan. Maybe not a bad game, but I didn't like it at all.

1. It felt a bit like the cards played me, not the other way around.
2. Too few cards with 4-5 players, after half the game, all have been bought, and all food/medic cards were useless.
3. I don't like the fight/auction over randomly powerful actions.
4. There's some kingmaking with snipers/saboteurs.
5. The cards feel too "samish", not enough special powers and variations.

This game shares the same mechanics of Dominion, but it's not nearly as good.  The game revolves largely around a blind bid for a random card.  An additional random element was added in a Thebes-like "dig" mechanic--where half the pile starts out as worthless, and more and more of it is worthless as stuff gets removed.  Also, they eliminated card chaining--if I draw a card that lets me draw another, I can't use it because I already drew this turn.

Comment: I really do need to get more plays of this game in. It's quite thematic, the artwork is great, the game can be tense in the skirmishes and I love deckbuilding. The complaints about the board being static reduces reputability are valid to a degree. Obviously the game won't be vastly different each time, but this is much more of a social game than about deckbuilding. Bluffing is an important aspect of the game and being able to play the meta game can help you more than just the deckbuilding. This game should have gotten more love than it did by Rio Grande and it's a shame they put this on the back burner for 4 years.

Optimal Player Count: 4 > 5 > 3 >>>>> 2
I'll play it with 2, but it's far more optimal with 3+ players.

Extras: Sleeved in Mayday premium sleeves and box insert was trimmed to fit box properly.

Okay game. It works, nothing seems broken, good ruleset, etc. I don't think there is a ton of replayability here though. 

Seems like the only real difference game to game is from the skirmish deck, which is a bit swingy for my taste (options range from useless yet worth points, to useful yet worthless, and of course really super useful and worth tons of points).

Some of the expansion stuff (extra end game goals) seems like it was tacked on to discourage trashing. The extra roles accelerate buying power and make the game run longer as everyone buys more expensive stuff sooner.

Due to the nature of the static board (unlike Dominion, which is a clear inspiration to this game), it's likely that there aren't going to be a lot of different strategies that emerge for one given group of players. 

You can win on dumb luck and lose big time playing the exact same strategy pretty easily. 

After 4 plays I can say that I'd play again, but it won't be one I call for to hit the table myself.

RATING: 6.5
It's not a bad game, but it isn't great either. My primary gripe with the game is that one of the currencies can only be obtained by digging in a deck called the Junkyard. You may wind up with few (or none) of these cards through the course of the game. Consequently, if you had poor luck, in the late game, your buying power can be severely crippled.

The bluffing aspect is great, and despite claims to the contrary, this is not a Dominion clone. 

As a base system, I think it has a lot of potential. It just needs some polish. It feels like it was rushed to ride the deck-building wave while it was still hot.

RATING: N/A
Obviously the mechanics are similar to Dominion, but I like the categorisation of the actions on the left hand side of the cards rather than the text on the Dominion cards. 

But from seeing Tom's video review, it looks like the game play suffers from not knowing what cards your opponents hold (though I could be wrong here and it may be the variety that makes hand contents cloudy), whereas the purchasing in Dominion is done openingly, hence you can at least anticipate the abilities of your opponent. Also not a fan of the futuristic setting.

A clever, well developed theme surrounds the standard deck-building mechanics...use your starting hand to recruit tougher and more useful recruits to become the strongest tribe in a post-apocalyptic arctic wasteland.  
I was genuinely drawn in by the art.  The "skirmish" mechanic adds tension and difficult decisions to resource gathering...do I send my scavengers out to scour the junkyard or hold them back in the hopes of winning a fight with my opponent?  Real tension, and equally real consequences to your choices.  
I enjoy this game immensely, and in the broad field of deck builders, it stands apart.

I am sad I avoided this game for so long based on reports that it was too confrontational and there wasn't enough variety in the cards. I don't find either of those things to be problems. Arctic Scavengers plays fast and smooth, with plenty of strategy and just enough bluffing. It is currently one of my favorite deck-builders. This game is dripping with theme, and especially shines with all the mini expansions and variants included. Hope this game gets the support it deserves!

I like games where you can attack other people, but here attacking the leader always helps the second place player, but doesn't advance you (unless you are in second place.)  There is no point in negotiation either.  So the ability to attack largely seems pointless.  May as well play Dominion.

Does have a relatively neat immersive feel for a collectible card game.

One of my favorite deck builders for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, in my experience, AS doesn't suffer from the same Runaway leader problem that many deckbuilders out there tend to. The mechanics are solid and fit well with the game's chosen theme. The bluffing elements are a lot of fun, it's always amusing to put every card in a bad hand into the fight and watch your opponents do the same with their good hands, assuming they're fighting over something risk losing and entire turn for. The game comes with it's own expansion, which can be added to the base game in as many or few parts as you like. When teaching the game, I often use the base set, with the Medic mercenaries thrown in as well.

The biggest downside to AS is that there are no alternate sets of cards to buy like one would see in a game like Dominion or Legendary. Every game will always have the same 7 sets of mercenaries to chose from. In the game's defense, the mechanics are rather different from a game like Dominion's in a way that makes it much harder to have hundreds of different types of cards. The variety of cards you'll dig up from the junk pile and the survivor identity/power cards in the included expansion really help add a bit more variety back in.

RATING: 4
I have to be honest, I am marking this down from 6, possibly 6.5 due to the designer's answers on these forums and rating of his own game at 10... mate, your game is random, that's fine and to an extend sets it apart among the deck building games out there - don't justify this with theme as if this was a work of art, it's average at best and a game potential being lessened by thematic 'ties' in nothing to be proud of...

The rules were clunky for a game that is light on choices.  Too many mechanics have a high luck factor.  Several cards are directed spite, which I find unsavory in a multi-player game.  Given that it was an early deck builder, these errors are understandable but still stopped me from enjoying it.

Reading the rules, I felt the setting appropriate. The mechanisms certainly sounded like they were imaginable, and the goal certainly is. Without seeing the cards I can't quite understand what kind of tension there is in and what kind of decision would go into the fight. Why would you not invest every card you have at the end of your turn to the fight? Wanting to play this to get a good feel for it first.

I like this better than most other deckbuilders since it felt like more of a hand management game and it had a decent theme.  That said, I never get a good feel for how well I'm doing compared with other players.  Between the variable draws from the junk pile to the contended resources...I dunno.  I won both games, but it didn't feel overly satisfying.

Additionally, it felt like you could take some risks on drawing vs fighting some turns, but a lot of times the hand management aspect seemed pretty set.  Sure, you can bluff a bit, but not all groups are going to excel at that.

RATING: 6
It's one of my biggest dissapointments; not because it's bad, but because - like Clash of Cultures and I,Spy - I really love the idea, mechanics, execution, but it doesn't quite work. Far from being broken, it doesn't however pose enough real decisions with every hand generally having only one viable action, the randomness of blind contested cards and finding a medkit necessary for hiring better mercenaries are a bit annoying, and the 'take that!' type of interaction of Saboteur and Sniper cards feels like a tacked on interaction from begone era in the style of 'lose a turn'.

I think the mechanics are sound, and it's really a pleasant game to look at it and experience, but it doesn't pose offser variability and suffice to say, we very often simply passed whole turns because of lack of real chances of achieving anything, hoping instead to luck out on the contested resource 'auction' at the end of the game, which boiled down to 'draw a card, highest one wins'.

I will certainly play it with expensions - I think a better set of cards, with a possibility to specialize in digging, less unffair skirmish rewards and more satisfying interfaction could make it an absolutely great game, with actually some game and theme around the basic deckbuilding mechanism.

One of the signs that this is a good deck builder is the fact that I didn't think about Dominion very much at all during the game; I didn't compare the cards to Dominion cards or say "buy" or "trash" or other stuff like that. So yes, you are building a deck, but the other actions and elements of the game are different enough for it to be unique to me. I especially enjoyed the junk yard deck that you can dig through. And the skirmishes are very good. Plus the ending was close. It's good.

As far as deck builders go, I like this one. I think the key is the player interaction in the Conflict phase. It really adds a different element of strategy to the cards that you play and it makes it a much better game for me than Dominion.

[Note: my rating is based on playing the 1st edition.]
My rating seems low, but I actually thought this was pretty good. I don't care if you swipe mechanisms from other games if you make it fun and interesting. Feels pretty clunky, but it's a small-press games, so some things are forgiven.  

The theme is pretty cool, too, and works better than Dominion's. 

There's a fair amount of luck, which worries me. In our game, one guy dug 4 times and got squat. Another got a Medkit in his first dig. He won by a large margin. That worries me.

Dominion clone.  It's probably not quite as good as Dominion at this point due to the smaller number of cards, but it has combat-type phase which is kind of neat.

Problem with making a game a lot like Dominion: it gets compared to Dominion. The game has some good ideas but the refinement isn't there.

Digging pile is a source of deep frustration: Do you get lucky and draw the medpacks, or not? And I can't believe anyone would crow about "interaction" which boils down to a standard blind bid.

The most underrated deck building ever?

I don't like deck-building games. I really like "Arctic Scavengers." 

It does a few things differently than any other deck-building game I've played. Firstly, there's a skirmish mechanism that not only ensures none of the cards in your hand go to waste, but introduce a very nice bluffing and combat mechanic. Secondly, each "Tribe" card has a "Tribe" value, only "Tribe" cards have a value, and the player with the largest tribe wins, so it's actually in each players best interest to KEEP the otherwise useless members of the tribe.

Gameplay is fast and easy, also tense and tactical. Great game.

This is a pretty interesting twist on the Dominion-style game ... too bad Rio took so long getting this game out! Too bad for me, anyway, since I haven't really been a big fan of Dominion. Generally, I prefer games that have more going on -- where deck-building may be a component, but is not the whole point of the game. And so I think I prefer AS over D.

We played just the basic game. Like Dominion, everyone starts with the same deck of 10 cards. There are also a display of cards available for purchase. But in addition, there are 2 other face-down, shuffled decks:
- a "junkyard", with a mix of useless junk cards and better ones
- a "contested resources" deck, with better cards.
All cards give you some combination of card drawing ability (from your own deck), points towards searching the junkyard (keep one, discard the rest), currency for buying from the display, fight (at the end of each round, there's an auction using these points), special powers (e.g., make someone remove a card from the end-of-turn fight, etc.), and VP (number of tribe members). The contested deck has better versions of everything, of course. It's also a game timer: the game ends when that last card has been won.

It's a pretty fun game, and perhaps even better with the included expansion.

RATING: 7
I had never heard of this game and a friend told me it was one of the earlier deck building games to come out, and sure enough Dominion (often considered the father of the genre) came out in 08 and this one in 09.

There are actually some pretty original ideas at work here for a game that came into the genre so early.  The game uses a lot of the deck building tropes still.  You start with a deck of basic cards made up of tribe members and tools.  The tribe members allow you to draw from your deck, purchase a new card for your deck, dig for a card from a special dig pile to add to your deck, or fight in the skirmish phase.  Tools boost those actions but are useless without a tribe member  to wield them.

The dig pile contains things from useless junk cards that just clutter your deck to mildly useful new tools and tribe members and can even contain much better stuff.

The game is progressed by the contested resources deck.  This contains incredibly useful tribe members or tools as well as tribe families that have large tribe member values on them (your victory points in this game).  At the end of each round players keep a certain number of cards in hand and the fighting values of those cards are added together with the winner taking the contested resource.  When that deck runs out the game is over.  However, if two or more players tie for the contested resource then it is shuffled into the dig pile so you can luck into a great card just from digging.

I think some of these mechanics are really neat and it makes it a very enjoyable game with a good number of interesting decisions.  There are two main problems I have with it though.  The first is that the cards you buy to improve your deck are bought with two resources, food and medicine.  The only ones purchasable with just food are weak cards you already start with in your deck and you don't start the game with any medicine resources, you need to  get them by digging.  So if your opponents find medicine early and you don't you find yourself already very behind, which I think is a very poor design.

The other, more minor issue, is that deck builders in my opinion only have life when expansions are released.  No matter how good a game it tends to get old when you play with the same cards over and over again.  This game has two expansions but past that will probably never see another since it has long ago been forgotten about.  It's enjoyable but it would have a very limited shelf life for me.

I'm disappointed with this one.  I heard it boosted as a Dominion-like game with more interaction, which I thought might be interesting.

Now the theme is interesting, the interaction (skirmish for resources) is OK; the trouble is that none of the cards are very good.  You don't get to build up a big engine and buy a very powerful card or one worth tons of VP - they're all just a little better than what you start with.  I suppose it [i]works[/i], but it's very bland in gameplay.

An excellent deck builder. There are some interesting and fresh ideas in this one - digging through the junkyard deck, using leftover cards to skirmish, and only being able to play an action once to stop those hideous Dominion never ending turns. Wrapping your head around all the potential options takes a little work, but is never hard, the icons are simple and obvious, and the game doesn't overstay its welcome.

Sold October 2015. Ultimately, Ascension is better, as is Rune Age.

Played one full game, and one abandoned game after getting the rules wrong. The rule book is garbage and you will definitely need the FAQ to meaningfully play this game. This game just feels supper fiddly with lots of eminently forgettable rules. There are also some mechanics that don't seem 100% logical - I'm still not totally sure how snipers and saboteurs work even after reading the FAQ. There are plenty of more tightly designed deck builders like Dominion, Trains and Ascension that I would rather play. There are too many games to be played to bother with a game where the rules are ambiguous or where you have to rely on house ruling.

Deck building card game with some direct interaction between players. The game is set in a post-cataclysmic frozen world where players have to use their deck of cards, containing types of people and tools, to collect more powerful cards to add to their deck. This is done by matching different symbols that feature on the cards (food, medicine, spades etc). Once items have been collected the player decides on how many cards to commit to an end of round battle. Each player does this and the player with the highest total of combat strength wins an extra card to add to their hand. Whoever has the largest number of tribal members (again depicted on the cards) by the end of the game is the winner. Anyone familiar with deck building games will have seen much that is on offer here before and the mechanisms aren't an attempt to do anything new. The combat that takes place is an attempt to bring some direct interaction between players, something that is often lacking in deck builders, but in reality it feels more than a little tagged on.

I dislike deck-builders. We should probably start with that point.

It seems to address if not quite solve some of the issues I have with other deck-builders, namely that I can basically ignore the other players (because of the the skirmish) that we look at the cards available at the start and devise a plan and then see whose was better an hour later (because of the digging and contested stacks of cards).

That's not to say that there are clearly some massive luck factors in the game. Can you ever afford to pass up contesting a 5 person Tribe Family? It's too many VPs to give up for free, but you really want to see that card going in to the last skirmish and not the first.

All in all, it's a decent game, but not one I'd ever consider owning.

Another [gameid=36218] clone or a game that manage to stand on its own feet and create its own little place in the world of gaming?

True, the game belongs in the family of [family=7568][/family] but holds its own. The theme is very much present in the game and the fight for survival is tough. Your aim in the game is to secure the long-term survival of your tribe and this is measured in the size of your tribe.

Every player begins the game with the same sized deck in terms of cards and abilities. From there on it is each to his/ her own. Every turn you draw 5 cards and are then allowed to play any number of possible actions according to the cards drawn. It could be setting people to work enabling you to draw cards from your deck into your hand or to dig through the Junkyard pile (a common pile of cards). It could involve spending medicine cards to hire mercenaries for your tribe and/ or setting people to hunt for food (to pay for men). 

Once you are done with your actions you announce how many cards will enter skirmish and place them face-down. You are allowed to bluff and can place useless tools in the pile.

Mercenaries come with different abilities, like the Sniper allowing you to snipe another players card during the resource face (before skirmish). Tools (obtainable from the Junkyard pile) can be used as weapons in some instances.

During skirmish the total fight value of your little army determines the winner. The winner gains the top card of the resource pile. A new round begins. Beginning with the 3rd round the start player (initiator) of the round is allowed a peek at the top card, thereby gaining knowledge of what you are fighting for. This can be very valuable, perhaps determining how you proceed - do you go all in to win the card or spend all (or most) cards on hiring people.

We played the game once and it was a very enjoyable experience. It took a while to pick up on how the various people and items interacted, which is typical for this kind of game. There is a great element of interaction in the skirmish which each round builds up to. Yet, there is no loss, except for the people migrating to your opponents tribe instead of yours.

There are truth be told very little to the game, but the way the various bits work together makes for a quick game full of tense play, bluffing and take that game play. I am a fan - no doubt about it - the one play left me wanting to explore it further, but... The game works best with more people and it took 16 months from our first play before we had an opportunity to play again (which we didn't take) - so for this reason alone we decided it deserved a better home, one that would play it.

If I had the group for it, I would buy the upcoming Rio Grande Edition in a hearbeat... highly recommended, at least do yourself the favour and check it out.

A decent deck-building game with a bit of a bluffing twist in the battles each round. The theme and artwork, while fitting the game mechanics well, feel a bit bleak and washed-out to me - certainly more compelling than Dominion but not as enticing as Thunderstone or Ascension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After only one play, my main impression is that the theme and artwork are both very attractive, and that the mechanics support the theme fairly well. 

Since this is classified as a deck-builder, the comparisons to Dominion are inevitable. However, I found Arctic Scavengers focuses more on hand management than it does deck building, while in Dominion the opposite is true. Strategy within AS typically hinges upon the various actions one takes with the cards in any given hand, while the strategy within Dominion revolves around deciding which cards to add to your deck, with available actions on any given hand often being quite apparent and requiring little to no thought or decision-making.

Somewhat due to that distinct difference, it appeared to me that there are far fewer unique card combinations or paths to victory in AS than there are in the base game of Dominion. This is probably caused by the fact that Arctic Scavengers does not possess any variable card setups within the base game. In addition, there seemed to be somewhat of a "ladder effect" to the cards available for drafting, meaning there were quite a few cards which all players would be likely to draft at some point out of necessity (Hunters, Brawlers, Thugs). It's likely that this will lead to end game deck composition not varying by much from player to player, aside from contested resources and scavenged tools, which are "hidden" information and are won, not drafted. This was a bit of a disappointment to me once I realized this, as the hunt for the most efficient card combinations in Dominion is what makes it one of my favorite games. However, I soon realized that even if two decks are very similar in composition, the decisions which players make with those decks can differ widely and can culminate in very different end-game results. This is, indeed, the strength of Artic Scavengers, and this realization eliminated my initial fears regarding replayability.

I don't see the need for gamers to take an either/or approach to these two games, as each possesses its respective merits. I believe Dominion offers better depth, more replayability, and the opportunity for more unique decks to be built within the same game, while I think Arctic Scavengers possesses a more original and well-supported theme, more tactical decisions in regard to hand management, a higher level of direct conflict, and an element of gameplay not present in Dominion - bluffing, mainly when preparing for the various skirmishes. The two games are different enough from one another that I could easily foresee fans of DBG's possessing both titles. While I prefer Dominion, I currently have both games rated an "8" on the BGG scale because I wouldn't pass up the opportunity to play either.

Once I get the expansion I'm pretty convinced this will jump to at least a 9, quite possibly my favourite deckbuilder. Feels like the most thematic of all the DB games I've played, love the bluffing aspect to the combat phase and how the character powers always raise a chuckle or two.

I have it in the recon box, all cards together, since one box is enough for me. The game is in a weird position, because due to it's language I can't play it with my wife and so it is limited to playing with my friends, but it is too much stuff to carry it to the pub and play it there. Traded it away.

Quite similar to Dominion as the players recruit tribe members and have them scrounge for helpful equipment. The big difference is that leftover cards are held in hand until the end of the round, where they are used to combat the opponents for the right to claim an item or guild member from a special deck. This seemed to be as much fun as Dominion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A mechanically-solid card game with the same deck-building mechanic as Dominion.  The setup is easier and I like the skirmish/bluffing option, even if it is a blind bid.  The people I've been playing with seem to see more cards in the skirmish as a "challenge me" event, so I'm interested in whether or not bluffing actually works.

Replayability is probably going to be an issue for some people who obsessively play the same game over and over again.  Fortunately for me, that's not an issue because my gametime is limited.  I can see pulling this out no more than once or twice a month, which is fine.

As some others have stated, not getting Meds early on in the game is going to limit your hiring abilities later, but it's been shown not to be as big of a liability as first thought.  The HQ expansion with the Medic will mitigate that.

The best deck-builder on the market in my opinion. It actually has a whole bunch of bluffing and player interaction. Imagine that!

Solid but slightly vanilla feeling deckbuilder. the skirmish isn't as tense as I expected, since there is little reason not to "bluff", and no cost for not succeeding. Enjoyed, will play again, but not a world-shaker.

Update: not sure I have the patience for deckbuilders. This one drags and the much lauded "interaction" is dull and pointless. Dropping my rating.

1. You know how everyone disliked the Alchemy expansion for Dominion because it added a second currency that just feels superfluous much of the time? Yeah. Well, now imagine that the majority of cards you can buy require that resource, and that you can only get it by throwing cards away to dig through a randomly shuffled deck. Not fun. And then one player had a leader that allowed him easy access to that resource. Guess who won?

2. I didn't enjoy the king-making element of the all-or-nothing struggles. Player A has 8 strength, player B has 7 strength, and player C only drew a sniper team and a bunch of equipment this turn, so he can't win the struggle but gets to decide who does.

3. As mentioned above, you have a whole class of cards whose value is entirely contingent on your happening to draw another kind of card to pair with it that turn. There was one player in our session who just kept drawing handfuls of equipment, even though he had almost even numbers of men and equipment in his deck.

RATING: 4
Good mechanics unsupported by the cards.  in particular, it has few relevant early decisions, combined with heavy luck for the first few rich-get-richer fights for the contested resources.  and that's not even counting the med issues.  needs more development.

This plays like a cross between Dominion and Poker. The added mechanic and depth solve many of the issues that people complain about Dominion (and does so much more elegantly than, say, Trains). However, it also adds time needed for thinking, which slows the game down significantly. If you love deckbuilders, you will love this game.

I'll start with the elephant in the room: this plays very differently from Dominion, and I think there would be room for both in a collection. This is more of a press your luck and bluffing type game, which is interesting. Lot of good tension, especially trying to figure out why the one with initiative chose to commit the number of cards they did. On the other hand, what keeps me from rating it more highly is that there's no guaranteed way to get meds. Even that would not be so bad if the tools were more worthwhile; most of them are actually worse functionally than people and have no VPs, so they're not even a great "consolation prize" when you dig and don't find meds (and the junk is just frustrating). Take out the junk and make the bonuses on tools better and this might jump to an 8 in my estimation. Even as it stands now, it's not a bad game, but I think it could be even better with a few tweaks before the second edition.

My Dominion killer: now that this is available in the UK, it's replaced Dominion completely.  While it may not have the flexibility and range of cards, there's an actual theme here well-integrated with the mechanics, and the direct conflict keeps the game engaging without being too in-your-face.  Pity this has remained buried for so long!

Clearly inspired (and more) by Dominion, this game feels much more slow and cumbersome but it also has some interesting mechanics. Togheter with the luck in draing card from ur deck, u also need luck when dealing with the cards you gain after the fight , but this last portion of luck is very limited by the first player peeking it.
The game probably lacks the variety of games of Dominion.

A head to head deck building card game in a future, climate-induced Ice Age.  We are hodge-podge tribes skirmishing with one another to survive, oftentimes reduced to cannibalism for sustenance.  An evolution of the genre that makes it far more interesting.  Each round begins with a standard recruiting and dumpster diving phase followed by an all in combat reveal of the cards you held back.  Love the excitement, bluffing, and decision making that goes into this. Winner gets the good stuff.  The card layout and symbols make the system logical an intuitive to grasp.

I think I'm starting to love deckbuilders. I've played Dominion a couple of times, but I think this is a much better game: more thematic and with a competitive element and the chance to attack other players, although it doesn't have the same variability in the base game. But the expansions should help with that.

It's true that you probably don't want to totally ignore the skirmish, but you certainly don't have to try to win it every time. In fact, it can actually be better to try to keep things even between the other players so no-one runs away with it. Besides, sometimes the card you win won't be that great, depending on the current state of play.

It's not just fun, it's actually actually pretty exciting, and the inbuilt clock ticking away can really raise the tension. A game with a great deal of potential.

 'm slightly sad of getting rid of it, but not really for the deckbuilding part. More for the bluffing that can happen in the Skirmish part. But that's not enough to keep it. As for actual deckbuilding, there's not enough action cards, so it's more a multi-uses cards kind of thing. Which ultimately means less combos. Having 4 or 5 other deckbuilders, make this one a bit less interesting.

I appreciate that Scavengers tries to be a deckbuilder in moderation, as opposed to something outlandish and broken, but the game is just dull, really. There's not much going on - not many different cards to draft and not much to do with what you've drafted. Some of the mechanics work; for example, only being able to do one draw action per turn, so that card-draw isn't just free deck slots. Or trashing cards whenever you feel like it, instead of using them. But the other actions are pretty janky, it's just buy stuff if you can or save up and pray for the skirmish. Shovel is a weird action; seems like there's enough medicine to find it reliably but it's really crucial while there are still Hunters, Thugs, and Scouts to be purchased. Also the treasure-hunting mechanic of seeing a bunch of junk, maybe something okay in a big deck isn't exactly thrilling. Nor does it tie into the other aspects of the game; people don't really trash cards that are good enough to care about so it's only lucrative if a lot of ties happen. Snipe and Sabo teams are the runt of the litter; Snipe doesn't begin to appeal until Group Leader, Brawler, and Thug stacks are out while Sabo is just all-around meh, a more expensive Brawler.

A competitive deck builder with an interesting 2 phase turn structure and some appealing elements such as scavenging through junk to find usable technology and fighting over contested resources and all of that post-apocalyptic grit. I look forward to playing this with more than 2 players to see how the minor rules differences impact the game.

Slowed down on this since the inital games. Want to try it with more than 2.

We have a raft of other card games that win out over this when it comes to choose a game. Between Arkham Horror, Legendary, Legendary Encounters, Star Realms, Apocrypha, A Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings et al Arctic Scavengers trails behind. Contender for the trade pile.

Finally got to play this a few times and it is by far the best card builder. Shut Up & Sit Down are right, this is an awesome game. This and Trains are my go-to deck builders.

Lack of variety between plays, one or two cards are very important, a critical resource (medicine) might randomly escape your grasp (the HQ expansion has a hire-able medic to counter this, but then awards bonus points for having the most medicine not including medics), a somewhat random blind-bidding bluffing part with the fights which can be extremely swingy, and finally probably worst of all, an end-game that drags on and lacks interesting options.

It had some interesting ideas, but ultimately not interesting enough to keep exploring.

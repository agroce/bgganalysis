Got this at Games Unlimited for $25 on the used rack.  Looking forward to giving it a go sometime soon!

Fun game and cool idea, but the co-operative/competitive aspect is a little awkward.  I spent most of the game on my own, dying, and never had a chance.  Probably gets better with repeat play as you really need to co-operate more in the beginning.

Sadly, this game has a bad ending scenario - and I really like everything else delivered. It has all the requisite accouterments of a dungeon crawl - interesting monsters, magic items, skills, leveling up, variety of characters - but the end game where a single player escapes just feels anti-climatic and not fun. I'll hang on to it for a bit and maybe give it a few more goes, but in general, not a game I'm likely to keep.

Played multiple times solo and had a blast. Multiplayer...friends didn't care for.

This one lost its luster after a bit. I think it does need multiplayer to maintain its longevity. That being said, there are some great mechanics in here that would work well in other games.

Fun but a bit lucked based all around.
I like how it is Summoner Wars themed.
The character design is fun but I feel that a few of the characters are a bit unbalanced (Emma, Sneaks, etc).

I like the combat dicing system.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
+ Fun level-up system; Interesting switch from semi-cooperative to pure back-stabbing competitiveness.
- Game can stalemate once the boss shows up; Game seems anti-climatic because of this.


Why it's previously-owned:
There seemed to be a lot going on for this game, but in the end, it always turned out to devolve towards the end of the game in a very unsatisfying way.  I had fun in the first 30 minutes, and then spent the next 30 minutes wishing it would just end.  It seemed one rule or one innovation away from being a great game.
I traded this away for Mission: Red Planet.  We don't have a dungeon crawler game in the collection and probably won't ever have one.  They seem like great fun in theory, but I never have as good a time when I actually play.

RATING: 3
+ It's a dungeon crawler
+ The art won't make your eyes bleed much
- The fonts are terrible
- The rooms are boring, samey, and repeat often
- The female characters are few (2/8, what the actual fuck) and stereotypical physically weak characters relegated to magic or "archery".
- Game is entirely dictated by randomness from the moment you start to the moment you finish. There are no meaningful choices that a human should enjoy making.
- What if a Roguelike videogame was garbage and manual.

Who is this for? Someone who has never played a dungeon crawler and can't afford a good one.

Very enjoyable and relatively fast, streamlined dungeon crawler. This one is one of my favorite in this medium-light category - better than Dungeonquest. Nice theme, just enough dice-rolling and therefore reasonable down time between players.

We've always played with four: adults, kids, teenagers (boys and girls). I very much like how it involves the players together. The best part is how players decide to manage their playing style before and after the Boss Monster. Before: you can play coop, help each other, in teams or even solo. After: it's all against one to the end! It's very interesting how it makes players evaluate if and when is the best time to push forward and drop the team. Who has the guts to do it first? Who feels powerful enough to pull it off and dictate the game's change of beat?

The experience is different enough each time that we always look forward to our next game.

You pretty much want to "fix" it immediately after playing it. Great concept but has a lot of flaws. The late game can often decide the winner but still force players to play through the chase back through the dungeon. Not much incentive to work together despite that being a central theme.

RATING: 7
Only played twice now. Game may be a tad too long for what it offers. When the biggie baddie is killed off that feels like the right length for the game to end. Nope, now the guy that killed him is the new baddie and he's needs to survive against everyone else. That's when the game is supposed to get exciting but...it doesn't. Opponents that are killed off are gone for good and getting knocked out of a game gets me to lose interest rather quickly. Knocking 30 to 45 off the time for this game would help tremendously. Still fun but could've been better.

My group and I enjoy this game soooo much, was a little concerned because all of the negative reviews, but after playing we fell in love with it straight away, as long as you go into this expecting cosmic encounter type smackdown and betrayal it is a real laugh. Really quick to play, like an hour tops once the rules are learnt. on that note my only disappointment is the wonky rule book, but there are enough faqs and info on this site to clarify any unclear rules up, so after 1 or 2 games everything is clear.

RATING: 4
Disappointed.  The game doesn't provide enough incentive to cooperate, and almost all of the mechanics seem easy to 'game' to victory.  For example, if you want the boss near you, then don't reveal the second-to-last tile, make someone else do it.  If you want to escape with the summoning stone, sit back summoning monsters until the players come to you, them run for it, they can't stop you!

Felt like the game was poorly play tested, or was in desperate need of editing.  I loved the combat though!

Had a blast playing this with my group.  The dungeon romp with monsters and traps is just long enough too be satisfying but not so long as it becomes repetitive.   The mechanic of heroes turning on each other to escape the dungeon is positively one of the most fun elements of the game.  We simply had a blast.  This game does need an expansion to increase the encounter and dungeon tile diversity. 

Update: All future plays have not been satisfying, the one came close. There's just not enough here to support keeping for the long term. It's a good game, just hollow. To the trade pile!

Dungeon crawler that, not unlike Betrayal at House on the Hill, starts out as a co-op and then turns into something else halfway through the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
The concept behind Dungeon Run hooked me from the moment I heard it.  Run through a randomly generated dungeon, either helping or hindering other adventurers along the way, before encountering the Big Bad at the end, whereupon you all turn upon each other in a final bid for ultimate power!  Great in concept, great in execution, but a bit weak in the overall scheme of things.

What this game lacks is motivation.  I'm not motivated to help my fellow adventurers, and there are few reasons for me to even stick near them.  I'm not motivated to trade items with anyone, since it only serves to strengthen someone destined to be my opponent.  I'm not even motivated to try stealing equipment from other players, since it's far easier to explore the dungeon and find your own.

I wish there were more dungeon tiles or monsters that forced players to work together.  I wish the hero minis were made of a firmer plastic (rather than the cheap, bendy material they used).  I wish the magic users felt more "magicky."  Hell, I wish there were more options for End Bosses!

What I do like is everything that this game promises. Text on the cards indicate that there will be an expansion in the near future.  There's enough here that makes me willing to hold out for that.  I can also point out that anyone I've introduced the game to enjoys it quite a bit.

Received in trade for The Thief of Baghdad

First play was solo and had solid magic dude and boss ended up being the anti magic dragon.  This equaled death.

Next play was with 4 players.  It was a bit slow since we all went our separate ways to begin and it really didn't seem like monsters were very hard to kill.  It picked up after I got the summoning stone and people tried to kill me, but I was a little underwhelmed.

I like Dungeon Crawlers that doesn't require a DM. This is one of them. I like that you roll a dice to see what a room does and then apply the effects and take action. The problem I guess is the much talked about "you become the boss" at the end where it throws the balance of the game out of the water. Being the boss is nigh on invincible. Looking forward to see how they fix this in part 2.

Oh yeah -- sign me up for this one!  A cooperartive game in which "There can be only one" survivor.  Variable players with unique powers that are customizable over the course of the game.  Modular dungeon that is different for each game.  Different "bosses" guarding the treasure.  And a 90 minute playing time.  Looks like a must-have to me.  :)

[b][u]Update[/u][/b]: All the components for a hit are there, but our first play fell flat.  I kept getting hit with monsters I couldn't fight alone.  And the end-game was anti-climactic.  Plus, once the dungeon is explored, there were no more monsters to fight, treasure to gain, etc.  I need to play this again to see if that was a fluke.  Initially rating at 6.

Whoa.  Tried once and hit the wall hard.  A beloved company, creator of the exceptional summoner wars.  An already created universe in which new characters raid a dungeon.  An innovative and exciting combat system.  And yet it fails. Haven’t been able to get it back on the table since its premiere but I’ll have to soon.  Maybe mix up the players a little.  It was slow.  It was boring.  It went FOREVER.  New room gets placed.  Roll dice.  No Monster. No Treasure.  New room gets placed.  Roll dice.  No Monster. One Treasure.  New room gets placed.  Roll dice.  One Monster. No Treasure.  Roll dice.  No Monster. No Treasure.  Don’t think a monster got to move once the whole game.  Rooms either need to be able to be re-encountered or something.

Dungeon run is a great, light dungeon crawl, where you explore a dungeon, uncovering monsters, treasure, and traps, until the Boss is found.

Dungeon run is a fun dice chucker.  The combat system is unique, simple, effective, and fast.  I like the unique abilities of each character also.  They play much differently from what I have seen so far.
The rules are a bit wonky, though.  They seemed very straight forward until we played it.  Then we had a lot of rule checks once we started getting into specific situations.
I need some more plays before passing judgement, but it is worth a try...especially if you are playing with some who has worked out all the kinks already.

RATING: 7
This rating would be higher...I like the characters and the exploration, I enjoy the switch from taking on the monsters to attacking the other players, and I enjoy rolling a lot of dice.  

But there are some major issues that keep me from really getting into the game.  

First, there aren't enough encounters for my taste.  The randomness of the encounters coming out isn't a big deal IF there are a ton of them to average them out between the players.  As it is, one person can get nothing, and another can get a bunch of easy encounters to help them level up.  And there are too few of them to have the luck average out over time.

Second, the items and how they interact with the special abilities is never spelled out anywhere.  This leads the game to grind to a halt while we discuss how particular items interact.  When the flow is disrupted, everyone's interest in the game drops.

I really want to love this game, and maybe with the official FAQ coming out, my issues will get cleared up.  As it is, I'll enjoy playing it every once in a while, but I won't want to play it all the time.

Picked this up in 2011 because of watching it on Rodney's "Watch It Played" YouTube channel.  The modular dungeon design gameplay was a huge selling point for me.  We haven't played this a lot because it's a little heavy for most of our gaming group and the switch in gameplay after someone gets the orb is pretty confusing.  I'll need to re-watch Rodney's videos and/or read the rulebook again before we play it next time.

Semi-Coop is another word for broken.  When players don't have an incentive to cooperate, and the game requires you to do so, it is probably not going to end well.  This one needs rules streamlining, and actual tangible rewards in the first phase for working together.  Jones theory: Wiz-War.

RATING: 5
It was difficult to find specific rules in the book. issues with wonky mechanics came up often such as: encounter cards, attacking each other, tile laying issues, free actions vs non free, and several others. Encounter cards were never make or break, we usually came out on top. For example, I played a three player game and I only took two damage the entire game before the boss very quickly, I defeated the boss by having the ability to roll ten dice. "Game", let's put this away and lets play something fun. 

I do not think this has much replay value, which is what I think the core of everyone's concern....no substance, poor rule book setup, and little interaction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The semi-coop is tricky and this doesn't do it right. Ideally, you spend the first half of the game building your character (but you'll rarely find item drops with which to do so) and the second half fighting with each other over the Summoning Stone (but really, with a one room lead, you can walk right out of the dungeon). Trudging first half leads to an annoying, take that second half where the winner is totally luck based.

RATING: 6
A group of adventurers venture into a dungeon to defeat its boss and steal its treasure.  Sounds familiar... except that this group of adventurers aren't friends.  Players will likely have to work together to defeat the boss, but then the first one to grab the summoning stone and get out wins, with everyone else desperately trying to kill him before he can escape.

Thoughts after reading the rules:
My favorite things about the game are the ability card decks and the monster battle system - some dice block, others hit, others can be either.  Cool!  This doesn't seem nearly as interesting in the PvP combat however.  The rulebook makes such a big deal out of PvP it is disappointing there is not more to the PvP system.

I love the art!  However, the encounter and treasure decks seem a bit thin, and the treasure abilities I've seen are mainly just of the "add 1 die" variety.

I would like to play this, but its not one I feel the need to buy right now.

This game is quick and dirty, and that fits our group just fine.The game it self if very easy to learn, but not so easy to win. Every character plays different and that is great. Every player has their own play style and can always choose a character to fit what they want. I have won a game coming from the shadows at the last minute and escaping with the stone,and I think that is why this game is so good. If you love a quick dungeon crawl with the ability to level up and back stab your friends than this game is for you.

Bought game with really high hopes but it just fell flat.  It's too easy to camp at the exit in the end game and there aren't enough tiles included in the game and you know where the boss is going to be as it's the last tile.  

I do love the combat system as it's original and very well done but what really kills it for me is the monster movement as it's just plain broken as the monsters have no real direction as you move them and then the next player going first moves them again and sometimes it just feels their movement is sporadic.  Personally I think they need to introduce AI in an expansion for the monsters.  I think the game still has a lot of potential with a good expansion to add more tiles and better rules and monster AI.

This game needed far more play testing. The early game is fun, but the PvP endgame is broken. Not only is it to hard to restrict other players' movement there is also no reason for the player with the amulet to fight. In addition the bonus movement one of the fighter characters can get on level up makes him strictly the most powerful character in the game. Would not play again.

Fun game that I first learned about from watching the youtube channel of "Watch It Played!"  My fiance and I tried it out and enjoyed it especially since it was set in the same world as one of our other favorite games, Summoner Wars.  The random dungeon makes for an interesting twist and the double-crossing plays to the devious nature in most of us.

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) I'm not a fan of dungeon crawlers and this didn't do much to change my mind. The first half of the game, which is ostensibly co-operative, was fairly rote and predictable, while the second half, which is cut-throat, was much more amusing but tended to end quickly and somewhat pointlessly. Needs some tweaking.

I can't believe how much I enjoyed playing this.  Very quick and the combat mechanic is unique and refreshing.  Deciding how attacks and defenses work reduces some of the randomness of all the dice rolling.  The leveling and equipment aspects are also simple but great.  The end game can actually get a little stale but getting to that point is a LOT of fun.  And having the option to work WITH or AGAINST your other players is awesome.

Really pretty game. Man, I wish Panic Station had tiles this nice instead of cards, but I digress. This game is a total dice-fest, but well-produced and enjoyable as long as you're not expecting it to be more than it is. The main issue I have with it is the abundance of little fiddly rules.

Dull mess with an unispired theme. With only 2 actions you either spread out to develop your hero or watch others profit from your efforts only to die easily if you are the first moron to touch the summoning stone. 

The players have no incentive to engage the boss except to end the game.

Man. I am sad. This game has the perfect ruleset and the perfect concept. It just falls flat because the beginning and mid game don't seem to encourage participation and instead reward going off and exploring by yourself. This is not exciting. I hope an expansion will  fix it up, but there is a lot it has to address. The encounters need to require participation more, and it needs to be easier to coordinate/work together in the two action limitation.

A nice little semi-coop, back stabbing dungeon crawl.  The game has a nice structure of exploration/coop in the first half which transforms into a PvP free for all.  The production is fantastic.

Suffers with fewer players, pretty random, but it can be quite fun when everything comes together in just the right way. This happened in one of our three games, with my wife killing me at the last moment for the win, after I had already executed the other 2 players. But my other 2 plays were either dull or frustrating. Hopefully the new version/expansion will deal with some of these issues.

This is indeed a very quick and easy dungeon crawler. In comparison to the D&D boardgames, I would say this is easier and faster to play, especially with new people, though it's not necessarily more enjoyable. 

I really enjoy that you can level up your character quite a few times (closer to Runebound). The "characters duke it out" twist at the end can be pretty fun too...as long as it's not a jerk player just waiting near a choke point for you to come back around. (The summoning stone mitigates this by allowing you to spawn monsters near him though.) That part can drag a bit..or you can just evade and dash for the exit.

What I don't enjoy so much: 
-The tiles are bland...worse than Castle Ravenloft IMO. Let's get some more variation!
-The minis are kind of on the lower end of things as well. I paid $32 for this..and $40 for the D&D games...WAAAYYYY better components in the latter!
-The monsters don't really chase anyone. They're in a tile with you. If you leave, they may roam controlled by the first player (which rotates)...one tile...and not necessarily towards anyone. The tension of being stuck in a dungeon is lost. Lame.

Average or slightly above average dungeon crawler.  Works a little like a cross between Descent and Castle Ravenloft.  The game has pretty good balance and a lot of variety in characters, monsters, traps, and items.  The dungeon tiles all feel very similar, which makes the phase where you pull the tile not very much fun.  The end game, with a boss to kill and a race back to the entrance, isn't very satisfying either.  That part of the game feels poorly developed.  The game has some nice ideas and was clearly playtested for balance but overall feels a little half baked.  That said, its a perfectly playable and fun dungeon crawler.

RATING: 6
Dungeon Run is a classic adventure style game where you explore a dungeon, find treasure, beat up monsters, etc. In a not-at-all-unique twist, you need to work together at first to defeat the boss monster of the dungeon, but since there can only be one winner, you start trying to kill each other afterward. Both the co-op-turning-into-competitive and the method of exploration via a tile stack owe a lot to [thing=10547][/thing], but even those mechanics have been seen elsewhere. Which is not to say that this makes them bad.

When it comes to components, this game really delivers. Nicely sculpted plastic figures, very thick room tiles, good card stock, great illustrations/graphic design that really set the mood while also being easy to read and comprehend.

There are some balance problems with the characters, no question. One character has an extremely high magic attack, but only a physical attack of 1. Some monsters and even one of the 4 dungeon bosses is IMMUNE TO MAGIC. So there is a 25% chance if you take this character that you will be all but unable to do anything to kill the boss (not to mention some other monsters). I suppose this is a ploy to make you have to work together, but not every character has this type of drawback, so it simply ends up being "some characters suck."

Strangely, the end game tends to be very swingy. Someone can be absolutely kicking butt the whole game and end up losing to a lousy die roll two steps from the exit. Conversely, I ended up winning my first game after spending most of it being chased around by the same monster and being unable to kill it (guess which character I had picked). This is undoubtedly an exciting finish, but it can sometimes border on anticlimax or perhaps even a feeling of a "cheap win". 

Of all the generic things in this game (both mechanics and setting) the one thing that really stands out is the combat system. It's difficult to explain briefly, but it's extremely intuitive when you see it in action. Essentially you end up having to make some difficult choices about whether to spend your dice rolls killing the monster or simply fending off his blows (or some combination). In PvP, these decisions are even more interesting.

Lastly, while the game is undoubtedly fun (if sometimes frustrating), I'm not sure that it really delivers on what it sets out to do. It's often better to set off on your own than to stay in a group of characters. Yes, other players could help you kill a tough monster, but there's only so much treasure to go around. Similarly, the game end doesn't ever turn into "everyone get the guy with the treasure" as much as "you go get the guy with the treasure, I'll wait here and kill you when you get back." I think if you know what you are getting into playing this, you can have a really good time, but it will definitely not be everyone's proverbial cup of tea.

On paper, this game sounds awesome - random encounters and loot, leveling up, unique hero abilities, random dungeon crawl with a very interesting PvP-type endgame.  After playing though, there aren't enough encounters and items to be had.  Considering you only get one stat point and one ability per level, the character building is a very minor aspect of the game.  There isn't enough XP to be had to even attempt it.  The summoner abilities are pretty powerful, and I'm not a huge fan of the endgame.  The summoner can simply make an escape action and then a move.  The other players can only move to catch up, but not initiate a battle action unless the summoner fails to successfully escape.  Considering an escape action succeeds on any D6 roll of 4 or higher, it's pretty easy to escape with almost every character.  This means that opposing players will likely only get one opportunity to kill the orb holder.  Time factors in too - this game overstays its welcome for how light the character building is.  Combat is time-consuming, and the PvP endgame takes a while to either kill everyone or escape alive.  Adding on that all the combat is dice based with very little that can be done to alter dice rolls, the game just feels too long for what it is.  I considered ways to modify the game but the interest isn't there.  It isn't worth keeping as it doesn't fill any niche for me or anyone I have played it with.

Very slow, very dull. Move a space, flip a tile, roll some dice. The combat system, with particular monsters being damaged by particular die results sounds clever, but I really don't see how it differs from a standard roll-over combat system other than requiring people to consult charts more often than they'd have to if they were just rolling over. Maybe I'm missing something, because it seems like rolling over four, so a 5 or 6, and rolling any 2 arbitrary numbers on a d6 are probabilistically identical.

It also has an unfortunate semi-coop element that doesn't seem to work in the context of a dungeon crawler, a genre that is usually either plain coop or one vs. all. Maybe the habit of cooperating ingrained by other dungeon crawlers could be overcome after enough plays, but I sincerely hope I don't play this enough to find out. As it is, it seems like everyone playing this game automatically thinks of themselves as cooperating, and actually using any of the take that elements in the game is taken as awkward and rude.

A great concept. Lacks an end game. Everyone is working to find the summoning stone, then bang, everyone tries to wrestled the stone away from the owner and escape.

From the get-go this game sounded like it was going to be the greatest thing ever. A fast-paced dungeon romp with cool characters set in the world of Summoner Wars? Heck yeah! But it's just... clunky. The design is cool, the concept is great, and the combat is neat, but the gameplay just doesn't flow very well. Plus if you get bad rolls your turn is over in a blink. I mean, I'm all for the random bit of chance a dice roll adds to a game, but here it just feels like the game is trying to take away your good time. The worst part, though, is that it's just too easy - and even seems to make more sense most of the time - to play Dungeon Run in the most boring, non-interactive way possible; that is, going off in your own direction, away from the other players. I know a lot of people will claim that we're "playing it wrong," or that you "need the right people" to play, but in this case it really does feel inherent in the design. Man, I really hoped I would love this game.

RATING: 2
What a waste of time. The game is way to light to invest this amount of time when it simply comes down to taking out the boss as a group and then being the last man standing. The way our game ended was most of the group looking to take out the boss. Someone finally kills the boss but is so weak that the next player takes him out. The next player then takes out the character who now had the stone and then he also became the new start player to boot at which point he walks off to the exit. Really? I just sat through a couple hours for that?!

Really hoped that this was GREAT after having loved Summoner Wars for a while, but this one just fell flat. Too many dice that you have no influence on. I like dice games, but this just felt too random (and I like Claustrophobia). End game concept is fantastic, but in reality, you are just throwing more dice against each other. If you like to backstab, try The Resistance, BSG, Saboteur, Escape from the Aliens from Outer Space or Shadows over Camelot.

Update: These guys sum up my thoughts on this game excellently: http://www.shutupshow.com/post/15312105809/review-dungeon-run

Only played once, but not a great experience. I dig the concept, artwork, and creativity, but there were too many things that were not as digged. The theme encourages you to run around together with other players, but there's little reason to do so, gameplay-wise. The monsters and big bad are easily conquerable by a single player, and health comes back to characters almost every turn. Even death is a minor setback. The biggest problem I have with the game is the big boss teleporting at the end. A character will trigger the boss's location the farthest possible distance away from the entrance. Since the goal is to kill the boss, take his loot, and get back to the entrance, that makes sense. But then that whole setup is dismissed soon after when a player can teleport the boss (and his loot) to any location in the dungeon, i.e. right next to the entrance. Stupid! Also, one character had a combination of abilities that allowed him to instantly steal any item any other player had, no matter where either of them were. That allowed him to stand at the entrance, wait for another player to kill the boss, teleport the "win" loot, and win instantly. Really stupid! Our last few turns of the game devolved into forced plays and two inter-player battles in which both characters died. Four suicides in a four player, 90-minute game is not so fun.

Lot of components and possibilities but the game play doesn't force the interaction I was hoping for.  At times it feels like four person solitaire.  Kids love it because it's easy, has a nice theme, and fun to roll all those dice.  Easy to understand combat.  Quality components.  Easy rules.  I just didn't like the gameplay.  I also thought the game didn't allow enough getting to know the cards and abilities.  It was hard to get to all the cards to know how to use them.  The game was over and only a small fraction of the cards would be played.  After a time, this was not fun.

I was told that you really have to have the right group.  Everyone I play with wants to see the tiles and new monsters, which is fun, but nothing to force heroes to interact.  I saw no reason to assist or sabotage and those times, if you see others, seemed very nuanced reasons.  I will keep it for the kids.

I had very high hopes for this game but it just didn't work out that way.  Nothing against Plaid Hat, just being honest.

Ugh.  Horrible game IMO.  Components are average quality.  Rooms really weren't that interesting.  The mechanics are flawed.  Dice rolls determine monster and treasure card availability and bad rolls can make for a very boring game.  Treasures were rare to come by and then often didn't match the character type making them useless.  There is no benefit to killing the boss because then everyone gangs up on you.  All in all this game fell very flat for me.  It was an easy choice for me to trade it.

A great idea for a game that fails on almost every point unless everyone in the group agrees to play it "right".  Rarely is there any incentive to stick together, upgrades are marred by a double luck mechanic (do you get treasure?  Can you use it?), and the 2 moves only is just enough to not give you a choice, but just leave you feeling like there is never a satisfying or heroic choice - 9 times out of 10 you're best off just hanging back and waiting.

Play Wiz War instead if you're a fan of fighting each other in a fantasy setting.

This seemed like it should have been such a great game. I love the dice mechanic. Ultimately though, I gave it away because there were severe balance issues. Hated that you could play a great game but your char type was completely ineffective on the random boss. Also, too much emphasis on the "kill-your-friend" aspect with not enough monsters to fight.

A ridiculous game.  Hang around and waste time until the boss tile is flipped.  Then hang around and wait for somebody to kill the boss (or, even better, die while weakening the boss).  Then, somebody grabs the thing (I forget what it is) and runs for the exit.

A better game might be one where you skip all the nonsense that precedes the boss fight.  Then you can roll a die to see who has to attack the boss first (and consequently lose) and the other players can then roll a die, with the high roll winning the game.  That would be more enjoyable than dungeon run, because it would leave a lot more time to play a better game.

Rating is temporary pending additional plays. Seems mechanical and none too exciting. The transition from pre- to post-boss seems jarring thematically and doesn't feel right fot a dungeon crawler. Combat is easy but fairly flavourless. Points for variety of magic items and ease of play, but somehow doesn't grab me. It seems to boil down to when to time your backstab and how to stop the player from running to the exit, which can depend on a wide variety of random timing/play aspects.

I found myself glancing at my watch a lot, which is not a good sign with a game. I was also playing with fun and interesting people, so it wasn't "the company".

Overall, feels flat, but doesn't drag. I wish a dungeon crawl game could get both aspects right (flavourful but not overlong or plodding).

Dungeon Run is an exciting dash through a dungeon packed with monsters and traps. Each player controls a unique hero capable of great feats, and whose powers and abilities are upgradable and customizable throughout the game. Players can work together to overcome the perils of the dungeon, or they can betray and sabotage each other as they see fit. Because in the final room of the dungeon lurks a powerful boss with the ultimate treasure - a treasure that turns its owner into the most powerful warrior they can become! Slay the boss, steal the treasure, and then run for your life as your friends try to cut you down. In Dungeon Run only one hero can escape with the fabled Summoning Stone. Don't crawl - run!Dungeon Run features a randomly assembled dungeon that changes each time you play, as do the monsters you face and the treasures you find. Eight different heroes each with unique options for customization further add to a wealth of game play options. Choose the vicious Tundra Orc and bash your way through everything that stands in your path. Play as the cunning Grounder Wizard and use your magic to cheat the laws of nature. Select the Guild Dwarf adventurer and lay traps to ensnare your friends. There are many paths to victory in Dungeon Run. Win by working with your friends or against them - just win!

While I might play again with 3-4 people, I don't really ever want to play with 5-6 again.  Game took way too long and it was a learning game on top of everything else!  Gives a bit of a Cut-throat Caverns feel but with more of a dungeon crawl experience as you explore rooms.  This is a nasty game where someone might help you one moment and cut the legs out from under you the next.

I have to think we were doing SOMETHING wrong here, because hardly anything ever happened. Rooms came up, we rolled a die to see what was in them (often nothing) and just kind of ran the clock out until the end. I don't think any of us killed more than two monsters or had more than two items at any point, and there didn't seem to be any way of generating more items. Only one player was able to level up during the game. It was like exploring a dungeon that had already been pretty much cleaned out. The final boss battle was also pretty anticlimactic. 

Willing to play again in case we were missing something vital, but if we weren't, I don't see any reason to play this instead of DungeonQuest.

This game is pretty good.  I think it needs a better selection of monsters and more of them.  We spent to much time trying to avoid the same old monsters roaming around the dungeon.  It has great artwork.  I think we could have a lot of fun with a couple of house rules and a second set of the game.

not very keen on the rules. played a bit on own but a bit heavy going so far.
On actual play with 2 players, it just wasnt really that fun
We played it wrong because we forgot to move the monsters.
and this meant 1 player got bogged down, but like a lot of people have said there is no real incentive to help or hinder and also it does not seem that easy since there is no incentive to stay in the same room as someone - you need to manage your 2 moves so you can move to a new room and then collect treasure from it. If you don't then you have no chance of getting the treasure.

Wondering if 1 move might be better....If I can ever get this to the table again..

Disappointed because was looking forward to this.

I've played this Betrayal at house of the hill the day before and the comparison between these 2 is very evident. Someone passing by our gaming table also mentioned the similarities. In short, I very much prefer Dungeon Run rather than any other light 'dungeon crawlers' as:
1. Gameplay is shorter;
2. Unique level-up pathways;
3. Less ambiguous rules (not entirely clear, mind you);
4. Less wordings, but still providing reasonable theme.
The shortcomings?
1. Some powers are a bit too luck dependent;
2. The ending is anti-climatic and may not be the taste of everyone.
For our group of 4, 2 loves this game and would like another round immediately (me included), while 2 others clearly showed their dislike of this game. So I suggest you'd better try a game before buying it.
Edited on 7/1/2012: Played 2nd time and rating down to 6. Many rules esp concerning combat are too ambiguous for a game to run smoothly. Before any official FAQs, I can't give this game a score higher than 6.
Edited on 30/11/2013: Played the game with the faq, and it becomes a much smoother experience. Though at the end 1 player needs to wait for 15 mins before the game ends, it still remain a super-fun, if not chaotic and a bit luck dependent game. Rating up to 7.5.

'Cutthroat Caverns with a board' is probably the most succinct description of this dungeoncrawler, and while it adds a bit of variety to the genre with a nifty combat system, it is far too long and overly complex for a game with a 100% luck factor at the end, namely which boss you’ll be facing and whether you just might happen to have picked a hero who is completely worthless against that particular foe. To extend this to a two-sentence-review, Dungeon Run is charming, but utterly unnecessary if you already have one of the many better examples of dungeon romps.

A decent game that I feel came out a little too late. If it came out in the 1990's, the game would be considered great. In addition, there are some flaws with the game design, lots of rules fiddling, and not as exciting as it could be. The rulebook, although very easy and sound logical on the first read, is extremely frustrating as we went through the game for the first time. Many rules were either omitted or were so hard to find. The game, targeted to be a 60 - 90 minute game, resulted in 3 hours filled with 2 hours of exercise in frustration. I thought our gaming group was only the one, but as I read through Drake's Flames website, he expressed similar issues. I still have hope for the game, although I believe heavy house-rules would be the way to change the game from mediocre to fun.

Played at Gencon 2011. Firstly, this game is a dungeon craweler so it automatically gets some positive points from me it was hands down the game I was most excited to play at the show this year.  Unfortunatly, this game doesn't add much to the genre and what it does isn't that remarkable. The entire dungeon crawl portion of the game felt very purposeless with no real reason to go and explore or fight each other. The boss fight end game didn't add much more excitement and the game ended with rather more of a whimper than a bang.  All four of the players in our game (2 of whom were strangers) left dissatisfied.  It was one of those times in which the disappointment actually gave us strangers a common thread that we actually felt strong enough to converse about after the game ended. I hope that Plaid Hat does some last minute magic on this one.

House Rules:

Holder of the summoning stone is treated like the boss.
Entering a room with the boss always starts an attack.
Killing the holder of the summoning stone levels you up immediately (including the boss).
You can spend 1 action to heal 1 wound or 2 actions to heal 3 wounds. 
Remove potions from the game.

Remove monster roaming from the game until the endgame. Then, the summoner can roam monsters. He must still escape from them or fight though.

This game is a great game to own and play.  I played this game with all three of my girls (all under 12) and we have all had a blast playing it. The game had enough variety that it had enough re playability. The game is easy and welcoming to newcomers.  Some of the encounter traps we found were easy to succeed. The directions were good, but not all encompassing. we did have to muddle through a couple of games and research a couple of rules, but overall, that was never a game stopper.

The end game was not as exciting as we had hoped, but we played it wrong.   The rules weren't exactly crystal clear. But we did get answers from BGG Forum. Consecutive plays were more exciting. But     

An Expansion is expected from this Plaid Hat games. My Think tank of 7-9-12 year olds discussed this at length. The addition of elbow connecting tiles would be nice,and perhaps a different style of hero expanding it to six different character types, A spawn Pitt Tile, A Healing room. Or perhaps add additional Three other different Treasure Stones each with it's own unique power to match the other three bosses. Have stones with Brawn, magic or skill modifiers.  hmmmm.   Truly this game is designed only to get better with expansions.

Really like it. I now have too many dungeon board games but this one is fun and different. In many ways quite similar to DungeonQuest but in other ways completely differnt. More opportunities for player interaction and nice twist at the end while actually being a faster game to play and smoother set up. That being said, Dungeonquest still has some advantages that make it worthy in itself if you really like the genre in general. If I had to recommend JUST one. I would probably go with this one.

We've played it a few more times. It's still a fun game with some solid ideas mechanics and a POTENTIALLY good flow. We've just found that it ultimately has too many fiddly wonky rules for how short the game is supposed to be. It's a bit too fiddly, there are a few tweaks that would improve it but ultimately when compared with other short light dungeon experiences, we just decided it wasn't worth keeping. Ultimately we gave it to a friend that they might enjoy it more. It was fun in a large group but even with us knowing the rules well, we still had to reference a lot of rules that were somewhat counter-intuitive, easy to forget or miss, or had strange interactions with each other. It's a pretty good dungeon game but we just wouldn't pull it out enough for it to be worth keeping. We no longer own it.

Dungeon crawl that comes with many cool ideas, a convicing dice-based combat system and a lot of humour - but unfortunately with some flaws as well. First, there are only few incentives for cooperation. Second, those players who decide to fight the boss monster before other players have fewer chances of winning. Compare it with Kill Doctor Lucky: Let the others do the work, than try to harvest their crops. In conclusion: That idea simply CANNOT work!!

Solid game, but it falls short in a lot of aspects. After about 10-15 plays, every game's ending wasn't very satisfying. In a 3 player game its one player waiting for two others to kill each other, and in a 2 player game there's no real mechanic for stopping the player who got the boss if you're positioned wrong, so a lot of the games don't feel very satisfying. Feels like it needs some rule changes to really make it fun.

This could have easily worked as a pure co-op game.

This game is the best version of a talisman-esque game I've ever played. Very cute, short and fun. Players run in, kill the boss, one picks up the boss's item and becomes the new boss, and then other players have to jump on them and kill them before they can escape the board.

Game claims to be 6 player, but only comes with enough floor tiles for 4 players. The rulebook instructs you to buy a second copy of the game.

The idea of cooperating until you kill the boss and then backstabbing your way out seems fun, but the limited amount of character improvement (through leveling and item collection, at least with large numbers of players) means that the game drags on as the dungeon is explored, the boss is slowly killed, and then the players climb over each others' swords to get out. Game runs about 30 minutes longer than it ought to.

Playing Dungeon Run is about as easy as your standard Dungeon crawl, but where it really shines is the moment where the boss is beaten and drops the summoning stone. Players will quickly turn on each other and chaos will erupt throughout the board.
The combat is very dice-heavy, but incorporates an attack/blocking system that I enjoy. The treasure, monsters and room tiles are well thought out, but I wish there were more so there'd be more variety from game to game. It's a shame Dungeon Run probably won't be seeing an expansion, because I could see it getting much better with just a few small additions.

I'm apparently not a huge fan of dungeon crawls.  I have fond memories of Dungeon as a kid, but I dislike Descent and similar games - just too many fiddly combat rules, not enough exploring and upgrading your character.  That said, I think Dungeon Run has a very good framework - combat/traps is just the right amount of dice rolling, some decisions about which skills to upgrade, and you usually get enough equipment so that you can't equip it all but have to choose.  However, the game fails in a few areas: rolling a die to get an encounter and treasure - if you keep rolling unlucky, unlucky being no encounter, the game will be really boring for you; you can't move that quickly, so if players get separated, they're separated for most of the game; and the end game dynamics don't quite work.  Really I don't think the game got enough playtesting by independent groups to polish it up.  All that said, the game can easily be modified by house rules to fix some problems.

A BIG dissapointment. 
--- Random tiles for which you roll some dice to get more random events. Sometimes you get NOTHING, other times you get encounters and if you're lucky maybe even an (again random) item (that may turn out to be useless). You use the encounters you clear to "level up" your hero, draw 2 random skills and pick one of them. I've spent most of the time thinking not which skill of the 2 is the best but which one is less crap. I found them to be another random element of frustration. Many times the exploration is just unrewarding, some elements of the game seem unbalanced (mostly because of randomness) and the rules seem poorly executed (most regarding co-op). Also, the end game is anticlimactic and seems out of place. 
+++ The combat is fun but that's about it...
 I would suggest trying it before you buy.

The only game I have owned where one player has actually walked out in the middle of a game. High luck, lots of take-that elements, and some odd character choices make this game a bit hit-or-miss, unless you've got the right group.

I think playing a few more times would have helped give people a bit more feel of what to expect - unfortunately, I'm not certain that was possible.

Simple and plain dungeon crawler fun. Easy to grab, intuitive, exciting and with great and hilarious ends and a nice story behind. Players try to acquire a Summoner Stone, an artifact that allows to summon armies in order to be the most powerfull creature over the face of the world. To do so, they enter a dungeon with a some other adventurers trying to pass its dangers, but with an eye open for the best moment to backstab the rest of your party to get what you need. The dungeon crawl to start, and one not to miss if you are a fan of the genre.

Won copy from Jack Vasel Memorial Foundation auction.

Initial rating based on one play.  Need more time to figure out what I think - maybe I was going in with the wrong idea of what the game was.  I thought thee would be more fighting once the summoner stone came out instead of just an auto win.  Maybe we didn't plan correctly...

Tried it again.  From 6.5 to 4...I'm trying really hard to love it, but it just doesn't seem Like it is going to happen.  There is enough to like for some people, so try it out if you think it's for you.  It just isn't for me I think...

RATING: 2
This game simply doesn't work. This has a lot of the problems of Betrayal at House on the Hill, but none of the charm. The first part of the game is fairly inconsequential, however that doesn't mean you don't have to fight enemies in a really awkward dice combat. After you uncover the boss you beat him in a longer awkward combat, and then fight one another over this stone, but it seems like the best way to win is to not rush to get the stone. The first couple people who get the stone will be killed because more people are gunning for them, so the best strategy is don't kill the boss and don't touch the stone. Dungeon Run aspires to be Cutthroat Caverns, but only achieves Munchkin.

RATING: 6
Note: I was really eager to get and play it. So far it has been disappointing to me. If that is to change, I will most likely alter something below :)

Pros
- Easy to pick up (and explain)
- 20 dice to battle with (feels like your attacks really are more/stronger when you advance)
- Very solid, high quality components (some may dislike the soft hero figurines)
- Okay graphics

Cons
- Not very interesting with two players
- The first phase (exploring and fighting monsters) feels too easy. Everyone can wander their own way without the being seriously threatened by monsters.
- The second phase (fighting the boss) feels too easy. We fought all 4 bosses, and all could be killed by one hero (except when you encounter one that happens to be immune to your preferred type of attack, ia brawn/magic).
- The third phase (pvp: fighting to survive/kill the summoner). In a two player game, the one to become the summoner wins. In a four player game, the first two to become the summoner are killed by the cooperating other players, the two remaining might have an interesting battle. That is if the summoner does not find a way to elude the other.. (I have no experience with a 3 player game)
- Knowing when the boss will come in play
- Having treasure and creature cards on the dungeon tiles (a card takes up most of the tile)
- The rulebook! When reading it front to back it's very good, but it's impossible to find something specific while playing..

This game was a MASSIVE disappointment for me.  I was so excited to track down a copy of this game and buy it, but after the first play I wondered whether I was doing something wrong.  The next play was even worse and I resolved to get rid of the game.  So unbalanced and based on luck.  Not enough tiles.  It has some interesting mechanics, but overall this game needed a lot more playtesting.  A real shame.

RATING: 6
Unoriginal semi-cooperative dungeon crawler. The aim is to explore a number of dungeon tiles as a team before confronting and attempting to defeat a boss enemy. Once this is done players attack one another until the last surviving character is the victor. Characters have four attributes (brawn, magic, skill, life) and these are used to deal with the encounters that randomly occur upon moving onto a dungeon tile (brawn and magic are used to defeat enemies, skill is used to deal with traps). Once enough encounters have been successfully dealt with the experience gained from them are used by players to level up one of their attributes. 'Dungeon Run' doesn't introduce anything that hasn't been seen before, but it doesn't do anything majorly wrong either. It uses a tried and tested formula, is playable in about an hour so doesn't overstay its welcome due to the random nature of the game but doesn't allow for any real character development either.

I feel like there's a good game here and I enjoy when I play but there's something missing. My first play involved teaching the game to people when I didn't know the rules so we made a lot of errors. The turn order shifting is annoying and there isn't really a good reason to play co-op. I'm also really annoyed that there are two bosses that totally shut down an attack method.

The promise of the initial dungeon crawl is soured by an anti-climatic finish that seems to hinge on a luck driven king of the hill strategy. In other words, the PvP action just doesn't seem to fit with the semi-cooperative build-up. I enjoyed the game, but it hung on too long. Perhaps the somewhat chaotic dash to the exit would feel less out of place if the opening was cut in length by half.

When I played this it was very late, after a couple of days of non stop gaming, so I need to play it again, but I wasn't impressed with the game play. It seems that once the summoning stone is aquired, there's not much you can do to stop the person from getting out of the dungeon, therefore making that whole part of the game just drag the end out.

This game really does nothing for me... it is massively average.  The idea is great, but the actual gameplay is a total snooze fest despite decent mechanics and art.

It isn't a bad game per say, it just doesn't bring any kind of fun experience to bear for me at all.  The end game, which should be super awesome, is pretty damn boring.  Both times I have played with great groups of gamers, which worries me even more.

I'd avoid unless desperate for something to do.  For a much better game with a similar feel, give Drakon a shot.

This game is a lot of fun! And sure, a lot of luck too. But what I really like is the social game. How to play and help each other and then knowing at some point have to turn on each other and when will that be. There's a lot of strategy in that and in counting the actions to either swoop in for the kill that someone has started or to grab treasure right from under their noses. Can't wait for an expansion.

It's good for what it is, silly fun.

Dungeon Run is an exciting dash through a dungeon packed with monsters and traps. Each player controls a unique hero capable of great feats, and whose powers and abilities are upgradable and customizable throughout the game. Players can work together to overcome the perils of the dungeon, or they can betray and sabotage each other as they see fit. Because in the final room of the dungeon lurks a powerful boss with the ultimate treasure - a treasure that turns its owner into the most powerful warrior they can become! Slay the boss, steal the treasure, and then run for your life as your friends try to cut you down. In Dungeon Run only one hero can escape with the fabled Summoning Stone. Don't crawl - run!
\13\\13\
Dungeon Run features a randomly assembled dungeon that changes each time you play, as do the monsters you face and the treasures you find. Eight different heroes each with unique options for customization further add to a wealth of game play options. Choose the vicious Tundra Orc and bash your way through everything that stands in your path. Play as the cunning Grounder Wizard and use your magic to cheat the laws of nature. Select the Guild Dwarf adventurer and lay traps to ensnare your friends. There are many paths to victory in Dungeon Run. Win by working with your friends or against them - just win!

RATING: 6
This is a fun little co-op/backstabbing dungeon crawler set in the Summoner Wars universe. The game plays quickly with enough player interaction to keep everyone at the table interested. There isn't a whole lot of variety in the dungeon tiles and encounter cards, but there are so many different combinations of hero powers that I don't think the game will get stale for quite a while. Gameplay is reminiscent of Cutthroat Caverns, but with less detail and far milder ways for player's to sabotage each other. Comparing the two, I'd say Dungeon Run is almost as fun as Cutthroat Caverns, faster for sure, but not nearly as satisfying. Still, it's a good game and there is certainly room for both titles in a collection. I'd just use Dungeon Run for a casual get-together or a session with tight time constraints, while saving Cutthroat Caverns for longer sessions and the more hardcore gamer crowd.

I like Dungeon Run better than [url=http://www.shutupshow.com/post/15312105809/review-dungeon-run]these guys[/url] did, but their criticism is spot on.  This is not a perfect dungeon crawler.  It wants you to cooperate, but doesn't incentivize it nearly enough, the endgame is wonky, and the whole thing is loose and rather arbitrary feeling.

All of that said, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The randomness is fun and often funny (with the right group) like random adventure games are, but there are enough real decisions mixed in to keep it feeling like a game.  The battle system is legitimately cool, leveling up is fun, and the components are fantastic.  Being a Summoner Wars fan, I got a real kick out of the game being set in the same universe too.

A short Dungeon Crawl that (a) boils down all the important parts of dungeon crawls to their essence, plus (b) offers the opportunity to bash on fellow players to get out for the win.

My rating will likely go up or down with more plays.

Unfortunately, after a couple more plays, I'm significantly downgrading the game.  There just isn't any there there. The game is flat and doesn't provide any sort of fun experience.

Very bad personal experience and now it is basically stolen because the trader never sent it back when the trade was canceled. (user RhodesN7)
Yes BGG knows about it and good thing the community is not like the admins or I would be gone from this site.
Actual rating? Check back in a few months when the sting has worn off.

Actually that user is my only Negative comment but the funny thing is that 3 other users comments, right after, basically say his negative comment is biased and I am not like that.
Point in fact that is the only Negative comment I have ever received in 100+ feedback's.
But RhodesN7 did steal 2 games from me and BGG did nothing about it... ya still stings in 2015, may never diminish

2017 and RohdesN7 is still a dirty thief and BGG is the anti christ for letting him get away with it, specifically  Octavian.

RATING: 6
I researched this game and had a good idea what to expect - a light dungeon crawl.  I would say that this assessment is correct, but the game play is not as exciting as I was led to believe.

I played a total of 4 sessions and each felt exactly the same as the previous.  Besides encountering new items and monsters, the pattern of events and resolution actions were pretty much the same on all accounts.  This definitely made the game somewhat dull and redundant; therefore, the replayability factor is severely low.

I would say that it would make a perfect stepping stone to more complex games such as Betrayal at House on the Hill or even Descent: Journeys in the Dark to assess whether or not these games would appeal to someone.  Anyone who is familiar with these type of games, Dungeon Run falls short.

Aside, the components and artwork are thematic, visually appealing and of great quality.  I do feel I got my money's worth.

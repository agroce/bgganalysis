Fantastic with 4 players. So many plans within plans. Luck plays a role, to be sure, but I like navigating that. This has a similar feel to Rococo (same designer, great game) in that you are weaving together so many actions and competing for majorities. The end of the game tension and excitement escalates nicely. Love the marriage mechanic! 

Beautiful board and components. Definitely a keeper. Matthias Cramer has become one of my favorite designers. A master of original and unique themes and fun mechanics.

Played with 4 players one time and despite misplaying a rule pretty badly, thoroughly enjoyed it (the correct rule would make the game better).

The "I pick, you choose first" mechanism was nice and the multiple ways to use a card along with the area majority control made for a fun game.

I HATE dice games, but the level of randomness of the dice was manageable in this game.

An engaging card driven game with the "I split, you choose" mechanic along with area majorities, goal cards scoring and plenty of player interaction. The game play is tight as you only have a certain amount of actions via the cards and you always seem to want to do more than you are allowed. The different parts of the whole in the game synergize quite well and come together for an entertaining conclusion.

While not bringing anything we haven't seen before, the game has it's charm and keeps you engaged until the very end. Nice components and artwork.

Usual Euro game. Nothing new. The game is very tactical and pretty random. You just calculate every single turn on its own. There is a lot of randomness in the game. Card draw, die rolls, hard to anticipate opponents.

Amazing game with really great flavour and theme. I think you could really feel the dynasty theme of the game here. I would consider it as a medium-heavy euro game which plays fast and offers great experience. Player interaction is very high. The mechanics with one-divide-the-stack and the other chooses is fantastic, I love it!

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
Really liked the way the "I cut, you choose" mechanism fits into this area control / hand management game.  Really tough choices, and some really interesting player interaction (this is defiantly not multiplayer solitaire).  I usually am a fan of Cramer games, and this one most definitely did not disappoint.

RATING: 6
The best game Hans im Gluck has printed in a while.  Still it's not a home run.  The rulebook is a mess and the gameplay feels cluttered.  I do like the use of the "One player splits and the other chooses" mechanic.  Would I play it again?  Sure.  Would I buy it?  No.

Another decent offering from Matthias Cramer. Nice to see that he tries to come up with different designs compared to his past games, instead of always recycling the same mechanics the way Rosenberg does. This gets knocked back to not being a better game because some of the luck from the dice rolls and resource bag-pulls can make a meaningful difference.

A great multiplayer game. I really enjoy the "I split, you choose" mechanic when marriages occur, not only for the tough choices it provides, but also because it forces players to cluster together, competing for specific regions more than they might in a more "multiplayer solitaire"-type Euro game. The card-driven actions are also very interesting, and make this game feel different from other worker-placement games. 

It's too bad this game didn't get more buzz or a wider distribution, because it's really a beautifully designed game. I'd love to see a workable 2-player variant, but even without one, the game is still worth hunting down. Another winner for Matthias Cramer.

RATING: 6
A game that is all about the "I split you choose" mechanism. Herr Cramer found several ways to integrate this very fun mechanism in a well-flowing game together with majorities, resource conversion and more. A solid mid-weight from HiG.

+ I split you choose rocks!
+ Easy to understand, teach and play
+ The game flows exceptionally well, with no downtime
+ Great art and components

= Many interlocking mechanisms
= Quite the luck factor, including possibly too powerful/unbalanced secret goals
= Many area majorities to look after, including bonus chits, etc
= Mostly tactical

- A tad too long for what it is, especially for the luck factor
- A few seemingly unbalanced cities (benefit vs. cost)

Do stuff which is mostly determined by random events. Get VPs for them. Hope you don't get screwed over by people not marrying with you, or by not getting the resources you need to start up things, or by not getting interesting score cards. Devoid of interesting decisions. Suffers from lapping disease (i.e., the score track can get lapped multiple times). Avoid like the plague, as far as I'm concerned. 

Nice artwork which manages to not get in the way of playing the game for the most part: that can't have been an easy design job.

Didn't have high hopes for this, but the marriage element worked better than I expected.   Dividing up the dice makes for some juicy (but quick) decisions, and it happens often.  I'm still not sold on the huge point bonus given to "singles" in the first two rounds.  All you can do is hope that somebody doesn't partner up with you, but you can't count on it.   The theme is pretty stale, the card layout (graphic design) is very poor, and the game is a bit too long.  But I'd happily play it again.

RATING: 8
This game from early in 2016 seems to have been largely overlooked thanks to the lack of an English language edition. Given that the game is completely language independent there is no need to wait, assuming you can find the game.

The game comes from the hand of one of my favourite designers, he of Lancaster, Rococo, and Glen More fame. This game is up there with those classics. 

It is driven by a “you cut I choose” mechanic, first used by Alan Moon back on San Marco, over fifteen years ago, and never fully realised since then. In Dynasties the mechanic drives tough decision after decision, and interactivity is within the heart of the design thanks to the mechanic.

The victory conditions are mainly driven by Area Control. But fear not if you don’t like Area Control (I am not a fan of it generally) as there is so much more to the game that this.

2016-11-26 : Matthias Cramer is by far the best designer almost nobody knows of and his latest game is another gem that's easy to learn but hard to master. Timing, long term planning, clever tactical opportunities, the uncertainty of the books and dice all come together in just the right way to make this a game to remember. Add in the superb layout and very clear iconography/graphics and it's simply one of the best games of the year - not that a lot of people will realize this, which is a shame
2016-12-03 : Another game and again a number of moments that made me go "aha - that's neat". There's no single winning strategy in this game, you need to combo and time your actions and sometimes have a plan B ready. Best game of 2016.

I really love the theme and the action system of Dynasties. But during play I felt frustrated more and more. In my opinion the luck factor is to big (Dice and cards). I also do not like games wherein alsmost half of the points is granted by collecting bonus cards.

RATING: 7.5
Great area-control game with a lot of I divide you choose moments. I'm usually not a big fan of area control, but here the focus is more on other mechanisms. The art and components are all great and the game flows pretty well after the first few turns. Only negative is that the game is hard to teach and learn.

Nagyon jól eltalált, közepes nehézségű, közepes játékidejű pörgős euro.
Az "én osztok, te választasz" mechanika valahogy mindig bejön. Jó a többségi rész, az akcióválasztás is. Egyedül talán a kockás hozománydobás vihet kicsit túlzott szerencsét a játékba, de ez se biztos, csak elsőre rosszul néz ki, hogy lehet 1 pontot meg 6-ot is dobni. Igaz, nem muszáj azt választani, de azért mégiscsak szűkíti a lehetőséget, meg az összhozományt.
Jó kis játék, kéne.

RATING: 6
Do area majority games have to be mostly tactical affairs? Possibly, but in this case other factors contribute as well. I-split-you-choose is something many people enjoy, and I'm not exempting myself from that. In this case, however, even though the sharing decisions are always fairly small they do happen very often and somewhat negatively impact the flow of the game. The constant interruptions cause downtime, and for a game of this weight, with quite a few random factors figuring into the final results, increase playtime for more than is good for the game.

Ein kunterbunter Mix aus vielem, was die Eurowelt so kennt: Ressourcen, Personenkarten, Kartenaktionen, Mehrheiten, allerhand Wertungsobstsalat und und und. Und all die vielen, alten, aufgebackenen Ideen ab in die Wundertüte, durchgeschüttelt und auf den Spieltisch gekippt, frei nach dem Motto "Viel hilft viel". Dabei ist die zentrale Belohnungsteilung beim Verheiraten "Der eine teilt, der andere wählt aus" schon Prince Charming: ridicule is nothing to be scared off. Voller Glück und Zufall kullern sich die Würfel eine zu teilende Mitgift, die Fortuna Füllhorn spielt oder Pläne durchkreuzen kann. Man wird bei DYNASTIES unbestreitbar Vermaulbares finden. Das, was man dem Teil  in seiner Haribo-Colorado-Haftigkeit ganz offensichtlich ankreiden kann, ist das, für das es Andere mögen werden. DYNASTIES ist Euro-Kirmes aus dem Copyshop ohne Überflug und Genie, aber dafür mit kindischem Vergnügen mit Bauch und Roter Hirngrütze. Dazu passt auch der wahllose Name und der alberne Untertitel.

It's an area control game that reminds me a bit of El Grande. The wooden components are really nice. It's a lot of fun and not too mean thanks to the 'I split, you choose' mechanic. The scoring system (drawing cards, rolling dice) is a bit random but I don't mind that much.

Thematically very close to Signorie, I like this one better, both by gameplay and clearer iconography. The rather rare mechansim "I divide, you choose" does show up here and works well, because it adds some interaction in an otherwise solitaire game of getting VP for majorities. Otherwise the usual Euro fare with resource and card management.

I had no interest in this game, as it looked and sounded very generic, but I since I was invited to play this in one of my groups, I tried it out.

Well, it's a better game than I thought it would be, even though it's still pretty generic. It's also not as heavy and long as I thought, which is a good thing, too.

The game is about card and resource management with majorities. Everything is pretty much straight forward, but not trivial and that's what makes this game a good one.

Nothing I need to own, but a solid game that I would play again.

This was really neat!  There aren't many middle-to-heavyweight Euros using the Gast-and-Goryon (aka I split, you choose) mechanism, and this one does it really nicely, because players need certain colors to complete the things they're trying to do.  You can probably get enough to do some but not all of the things you want to do.  In any case, it's attached to a really crunchy area control game in which your pieces interact with others' in really interesting ways (for instance: marriage).  Unfortunate that this isn't really available in the US yet. (1 play)

Not as good as I expected. People compare this game to Marco Polo, but it looks and feels more like Royals. Both are better games. Dynasties is too long, there is too much downtime, and there's quite some luck involved which is frustrating. When you don't get the right cards or pull the right resources out of a bag you might not get a chance to improve your actions, and your options are limited. And it's hard to get new cards, or the right resources from the harbor or dice during marriage.

The game flows well, but unfortunately a game of majorities does not tolerate so much randomness at the end of the game, when the controls of regions are about to be decided. Those dice can ruin any previous strategy.

On the other hand...  I know that eurogames don't necessarily have to be historically accurate, but, besides a unified Britain in the XVI century or a Denmark inside the Holy Empire, never had I imagined a country called Hispania with a cognac brand icon as its coat of arms. Seeing is believing.

[b]Divider-Chooser:[/b]
For those unfamiliar with the term, divider-chooser is a method of fair division in which one person divides things into two piles and the other person gets first choice of which pile to take, the divider gets the other pile. I was very excited when I saw this was used in several places in the game. Unfortunately, I found the decisions created by this were not nearly as interesting as I had hoped. In the majority of cases it seemed obvious that there was a correct way to divide the resources. Very few cases presented an interesting choice. 

[b]Luck:[/b]
There is just a bit too much luck in this game for my tastes. It is possible to be locked out of an action by not drawing an appropriate card at the start of the round. Cards typically have 2 actions on them and you draw 4 cards each round. It is not terribly unlikely to have a deficit of one action in your hand. This can be a huge issue if you have set yourself up to do a particular action. It isn't really possible to stay flexible since you need to complete goals. This issue is particularly nasty if you draw no prince actions or no princess actions. Really though, this is just an extreme example of the kind of pervasive reliance on luck this game exemplifies. Someone who draws actions and goals that synergize well is in a better position and since you draw very few of both throughout the game the variance is large. The winner almost certainly has luck to thank for her victory. That isn't to say she only has luck to thank.

Another solid HiG title aimed at gamers, another solid Cramer. The unpopular area majority principle coupled with non-neglectable randomness will keep it from reaching the popularity of previous HiG hits Russian Railroads or Voyages of Marco Polo.

The strategy mostly consists in keeping focused on one or two majorities, otherwise the game is won tactically. Choices are interesting: how to use the cards, which of the several minor races for limited spots or actions to prioritize, immediate points or more resources.

I enjoyed the tactical nature and the I-split-you-choose mechanism used in shipping and marriage. It's a fun element that players have to form a temporary alliance to trigger the resolution of a split. The randomness in the marriage rolls, the random influence on majorities and the spread of score cards could decide a game although this wasn't a problem in our game with scores differing more than 50 points between first and last player.

An area control and resource mabagement game which a unique 'share' mechanik in which one player splits resources and the other chooses which split to take.

RATING: 7
The lack of effort they made in the theme is almost ludicrous. Usually there's some flavor text in the rulebook, straining to give some sort of background or setting. But they don't even try here, it's all about gaining influence among European nobles! And believe me, you will feel the theme deeply as you play the game. You will feel the pain of being stuck as a single monarch, unable to bear children or extend your family name. You will feel the joy of finally conceiving children as well as the bounty brought by a generous dowry. You will experience the gnawing guilt brought on by your duplicitous backroom backstabbing as you claw to tear down rival families. And all within 90 minutes!

All kidding aside, this is a perfectly adequate game that is easy to teach and learn, engaging to play, but wholeheartedly JASE to its core. But for many of us that's not a problem.

Classic area control with multipurpose cards, factorfictioning, neat marriage mechanisms and engaging theme. All that suggests I should like this a lot, but I don't. Luck of draw can cause huge swings, balance of the five cube colors feels very off and uncertainty caused by possible hidden influence info adds badly to the AP.

Remek ötletek vannak benne, bár nem sok újdonságot tartalmaz, de nagyon jól összerakott, összességében nem szokványos, jó játék a Dynasties. Viszont ahogy megnéztem a születésének évszámát, kicsit meglepődtem. Érzetre legalább 5-10 éves játéknak mondanám, 2016-hoz képest a megjelenés (nem csak az illusztrációk, hanem a vizuális megoldások (pl. ikonozás)) nem valami aktuális. Persze valószínűleg a mostani overproduced trendet nem kívánták követni, de talán ez a játék megérdemelt volna egy kis több törődést. Egyébként nagyon korrekt mechanikailag, nekem tetszett.

A game about building majorities/influence via marriages of your political rulers within various European countries.  There is a nice blend of randomness and luck but  it all works wonderfully well.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Cramer designs another solid game which involves a couple different actions where one player must split the pie and the other player chooses their piece first... This one is card driven - cards have different uses. Scoring is largely dependent upon goal cards, region majorities, and single members of your family. There are several different parts that come together quite well to make for an interesting game. I'm doubtful there is anything new, but I enjoyed the game and the use of pie splitting mechanic inside a larger scope of design.

Schönes Spiel mit dem Verteilerkniff.
Wer an der Reihe ist spielt eine Karte aus und wählt eine der auf dieser Karte abgedrcukte Aktionen. Er kann Figuren in Städte setzen, Handeln betreiben, Adlige nutzen, etc.
Wer in eine Stadt setzt, in der ein Mitspieler bereits sitzt, werden 3 Würfel geworfen und der auf dem kleineren Aktionsfeld teilt die 3 Würfel in 2 Hafen. Der auf dem Größeren wählt einen der beiden und erhält Siegpunkte, Auftragskarten, ein Kind, etc.
Der Handel funktioniert nach dem selben Prinzip.
Nach drei Runden wird abgerechnet. Jetzt gibts noch Punkte für Mehrheiten in den Ländern und wer am Ende die meissten hat gewinnt.
Das Spiel macht Spaß und ist mechanisch sehr gut ausgetüftelt. Ich denke aber, dass es dennoch zu selten auf den Tisch kommt und ich ein Marco Polo oder anderes vorziehen würde, kommt es leider aus der immer kleiner werdenden Sammlung :)

Dice and card dealing influence the game too much. Especially near the end of the game a dice roll can completely decide on winning or loosing. Too much luck (for this kind of tough game) and poor theme presence. Only playable from 3 players (preferably 4 or 5).

Otherwise gaining influence in a country by marriage is an interesting mechanism. Also divide and let the other one choose (like in San Marco), is a nice mechanism that we didn't see much in games yet.

Interesting design but much too euro for me. The theme just doesn't pop - takes some of my (Legacy) marrying and having babies, but it's all so abstracted it becomes meaningless and just another calculation. A pity as it's not a bad game and plays nicely

RATING: 7.1
Very clever interweaving of mechanisms into what is essentially an area control game. The "I split, you choose" idea turns up several places here, adding both to the sense of tension and the sense of theme, which involves arranging marriages for diplomatic reasons. The luck factor seems manageable, but I'm not quite sure how I feel about it yet in a game that tightly constrains your actions. More plays will tell on that front, but overall this strikes me as an intriguing design that I'm excited to play more of.

A solid mix of multipurpose cards, secret goals, and area majorities, without too much clutter on top of those.

RATING: 5
Has some interesting integration of I split - you choose mechanics and the theme is kind of cute, but overall this one felt a bit too long, with a few too many things going on without a proper payoff for some of them. Solid, but nothing I'd absolutely seek out again.

Dynasties: Heirate & Herrsche is an area control game based on the "I split, you choose" mechanic. Players use action cards to either get cubes or claim a city using either the larger or smaller space. However, you don't actually get the cubes until someone else places on the other spot, at which point the player in the smaller spot splits the cubes into two groups, and the player in the large spot chooses a pile first, and the smaller spot gets the remaining. When someone takes the other spot in a city (thematically marrying that pawn), the player in the smaller spot rolls three reward dice, and the players split and choose in the same way. In the end, each of the four countries is scored for area control. I thought this game was really clever, and the best implementation of "I split, you choose" I've seen in a board game. Plays really smoothly too.

I had some worries about this title: it had a low rating (6.94 on 14/04/2016) and the 2 previous games of Matthias Cramer (Kraftwagen & Pi Mal Pflaumen)were not quite my taste. This game however is again very good. It's in fact just HiG-good as we're getting used to. The rules are again very clear and everything seems to be easy when you get the explanation, but it's in fact not that easy to execute :s Excellent game!

I learned it and then I taught it. Actually a very easy game to teach and play once you get into it. I really like the tough choices and the gambling with the dice results. You might just get bad luck of the draw and get screwed over though. I think it plays super fast with 3p we played in 45 minutes which was awesome and we were just learning. very cool Euro. Not sure it is on my wishlist because I have a lot of Euros. I would gladly play this again and I really hope to!

Az utóbbi időben a legnagyobb pozitív meglepetés.
5 fős játék.
Az őt nagy európai házaknak (spanyol, francia, angol, német)a kisebb nemesi vagyunk, akik igyekeznek beházasodni más uralkodói családokba. Természetesen arra nincs mód, hogy mi adjuk a férjet és a feleséget az adott helyen, hisz az vérfertőzés lenne, az meg ugye már egy ideje szembe megy a józan ésszel. :)
Fix három körös a játék, a elsőben díjazzuk a "szóló" uralkodókat, a másodikban büntetjük, tehát érdemes megtalálni a párunkat és a harmadikban a dominancia fog számítani az adott országban.

RATING: 9
At the start of the game, each player gets a hand of cards. Each card has three printed actions on it, which dictate what you are allowed to do on your turn. Already, we have a very flip-lucky situation. The game also features dice, which have some very powerful effects, including just get 6 points, get an extra meeple in a region, or take an extra 'get goods action'. The game also only goes for 3 rounds, so everything you do is tight tight tight. From just reading the rules I was sure that this game was going to be far too random for my taste.

Turns out, I don't know a good book by it's cover. This game turned out to be fantastic. With the multi-use cards, you can usually get what you want from a round if you plan carefully. Not to mention, there's mitigation in the fact that one of the cards activates these special once per round use tiles in the blue area of the board, so even if you don't have the black action in your hand, if you are clever, you can use the blue action to get what you wanted instead.

Another big plus to the game is that most of the actions have a mechanism where by one player splits a lot, and the other player chooses which lot they want. This is done with the goods collection, and it's done with the die roll results. This is a very fun mechanism, but most games I've seen that have used this suffer from massive downtime problems. Not so here. This game makes the splitting choices hard, interesting, and fast. Not to mention, that when you get those powerful die results, knowing that your opponent gets their pick of the results first, really evens out the randomness nicely.

Another big luck mitigation is the fact that at the end of the game, when you score regions for whoever has the most meeples + crests belonging to that region, if two players tie, they both get full points. This means that in general, if you are 1 up on a region, someone can get a lucky roll or do a last minute plant into that region, and you still get credit for your work. I can't emphasize enough how important this is in this game.

:star: Clever or interesting mechanisms

Some might say there is too much luck involved, but the I-split-you-choose mechanic keeps every decision interesting. A bit of an area-control point salad, where resurces are so tight, but you need to be able to perform important actions at the drop of a hat. The multi-use cards, the dice, marrying your workers to other players, cashing in on the right passing bonuses. There are a lot of little details, yet everything plays incredibly smooth. Cramer has quickly become one of my favorite designers.

RATING: 7
Played once with 4P. Dynasties is a solid Euro which follows a formulaic script of tactical card play, secret objectives and competition for area majorities. What elevates it from mediocrity, however, is the use of the 'I-split-you-choose' mechanism to gain majorities and resources. This adds a neat dynamic in which players are nudged into collaborating for mutual benefits, but have to be wary that their partners don't get a distinct upper hand in collaborations. 

The game flows smoothly since splits are only ever made between two players at most. The drawback is that obvious optimal divisions present themselves at several instances. And while I happily accept luck of the draw in the game, I don't really care for how dice rolls can confer late-game swings in majority.

tl;dr: solid euro

I saw some comments that this game is too random. I'm not sure why they say that. Like any area majority game, things can change rather quickly, but the only real random element is what cubes come on the boats and the dice, which never hurt you, they only give you stuff you want.
In any case, this is a nice game like so many HiG titles. Well designed, good art, good components, plays well, good strategy without being too complex. The only real knock I can think of is that it doesn't feel that original, but it works great, so I'll forgive it for that.

Very good multi-use cards/area control game. There is a nice tension of wanting to wait to take more valuable actions, but needing to get meeples on the board. The you split, I chose mechanic creates some tough decisions.

I really wanted to like this. The game is beautiful, the ideas are good and the theme works pretty well. However, the luck factor in Dynasties is incredibly - and disappointingly - high. Die rolls dictate the rewards of the game's key mechanic, marriage, meaning some players will reap large rewards and others just don't. Random card deals dictate which actions are available to a player, and if the action you wish to take isn't randomly dealt to you, well, too bad. There are certainly ways the designer could have mitigated the luck here, and pretty amazing he did not. Great ideas but needed more play testing.

Another solid entry in the catalog of HiG. Great implementation of the I-cut-you-choose mechanism. Very well designed and has some interesting game play. Getting the goal cards is key to victory, but not always easy to get. Above average components, but very good iconography.

One game played, suffered from runaway leader with absolutely no way for anyone to catch him.  If you draw large numbers of scoring cards, you can dominate this game.  Cards and cubes have to be managed smartly and there are going to be turns where you don't really have a viable action that will do you any good.  Take it or leave it.

Strongly like: "I split, you choose" decisions, which are a major part of the game. 

Strongly dislike: hidden scoring objective cards, which are a major part of the game.

I prefer San Marco when it comes to a 90 minute "I split, you choose" game - it's more elegant and less self-absorbed. But I would play Dynasties if asked, it's OK.

RATING: 2
The randomness of the dice is only in theory mitigated by the "I split you choose" because sometimes you just roll better things, and both players get better stuff. Also this is kind of brilliant but in this game there is no engine building at all, and yet there is still a rich get richer thing going on, because if you get more cubes / better cards / better access at blue tiles somehow, you get to place more people, which leads to more marriages, which leads to you having more cubes or more shields/children which also count in the majorities. The game definetly needs variable turn order, instead of just having a start player (this can easily be houseruled though but shame on the designer). There are things that can happen in the last round that mean instead of getting a bunch of points you get nothing. For example a friend of mine had blue cubes and no blue cards, or when you roll for marriages you could roll ships and cubes, which you don't need anymore, either because you have enough, or you don't have any actions left. Some of the blue tiles are very strong, and some of them are nearly useless, their price is random, and just player order and getting blue or not cubes gives us another random factor here (plus some of them are only accessible by certain cards).
Now, I already don't like area control, and this is just a bad one, the mechanisms are boring, most of the time there is one very good thing to do and on top of that ultimately it's insanely random. I hated playing it. Interestingly all my friends liked it... until now. I guess all the problems of the game came out. But they were there all along.

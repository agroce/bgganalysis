Has some positives and negatives as compared to Paperback. In Hardback, the pace of the game moves a bit faster turn to turn, and the combos you can build are much more satisfying.  But, the offer feels much less open, as you will likely want to focus on a couple of genres. The timeless classics are a decent way to interact with the other player, but the common cards of Paperback are much more satisfying.  Hardback also feels a bit more repetitive than Paperback. This is exhibited in the differences between the power arcs of the decks in the two games. In Paperback, you are able to step up in buying power throughout the game and moving from, say, buying 6c cards to 8c cards, or grabbing a common card for a 9 letter word, are clear indications of your deck's growing power. In Hardback, you're more likely to buy a few genre cards to combo and then spell a similar set of words every time through the deck. In Hardback, your incentivized to stay lean and mean, so you can continue marching up the prestige track -- the difficulty and length of the words you can spell are secondary. Overall, Hardback feels less a word game and more a deck-builder given a word theme--and there are better deck builders out there.

Edit, Feb. 2018: Reading a bit more about the game, I think I should give this yet another go with the literary awards. As of now, Paperback is the superior title, because it feels like a word game and a deck builder. Hardback -- with the main rules -- feels mostly like a deck builder.

I'm normally not a fan of word games, but this one is pretty impressive. It feels like an actual game, as opposed to a word-making exercise. Much better than Paperback, for sure. 

There are now suits ("genres") that combo together, so you have an incentive to make strategic buying decisions (by "going in on" one or more suits). Words are also easier to make now because you can use any card as a "wild" letter, but since those cards won't score points or earn money, you are better served by using your letters (though you aren't punished for not using them). With a few more plays, this may become my favorite word game of all time.

For me the thing that kept holding paperback from working well was that it felt difficult to build a useful deck.

In dominion you can read the effects of each card, plan for it, then craft your deck. In Paperback you see some letter, some abilities, and some purchasing power...but you don't really have a concrete idea as to how they'll work together. You also can't plan a deck because the letters change on the cards within each stack.

If I take that P, how will that work with the rest of my letters? What even are the rest of my letters?

Hardback solves this in two ways. 
1) every card can be a wild. This is incredibly important because A. It speeds up the game, not as many difficult draws, and B. It makes drawing those difficult to use letters not as scary. 

2. With the genre bonuses I can actually plan a deck. If I use a lot of wilds, I'm going to go heavy mystery and get a benefit from those wilds. The letters may still be a challenge to use (although significantly less difficult), I can always mix in a wild and get it's money/points.

As someone who has a much more limited vocabulary, especially when under pressure, Hardback feels much more exciting. I can make bigger moves, bigger combos, and in a quicker time. No more spelling hat and not having enough money to buy anything.

Also, the point system feels a lot better. The game doesn't feel like it gets stuck in the luck half way through like Paperback always did.

Overall Paperback is a 5/10, Hardback is a 7/10.

First let me say that word scrabble games aren't my thing as I'm very bad at coming up with them

However the mechanics in this game work very well together. The deck building + combo colors are the key to really ramp up your point scoring/$. Being able to play any card as a wild helps a lot in creating words. The length of play is good too and the ink mechanic works well to make big words
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Having a score track with no end game scoring is a huge problem with this game. Every game I've played it's been obvious who is going to win well before the game actually ends.

Contributing to this is the Ascension style of access to cards, and a "wipe" mechanic that is too strict, especially in a low player count game. The result is that the winner is the player who sees cards that will help their strategy.

I really wanted to like this game. It has awesome components and a great lineage in being a "prequel" to Paperback, but I'm not sure why I'd ever choose to play this over Paperback.

Word deck builder game. I enjoy all the changes made to this game compared to paperback, makes it more fun for me (even though I am still not likely to win haha).

There is possibly a bit "too" much attention to theme that it hinders functionality, ie the book score markers are awkward to use (I put in cubes to use instead), the term "jail a card" sounds like vague jargon but if it were "reserve a card" that would be clear without having to explain further, etc.

It seems like the game would play BEST with fewer players--with 5 players it was impossible for your Timeless Classic card to stay in play. With 3 players it rarely ever happened, (but it actually would happen sometimes).

This game is better than Paperback for me. The set collection of cards changes each deck’s gameplay to suit its style. Unfortunately the push your luck mechanic limits the number of letters in a word for Hardback. Words in this game barely pass 7-8 letters. I sort of miss making those long words in Paperback. Also I dropped the rating coz the publisher couldn’t send me replacement stickers for a badly produced meeple.

I love Paperback, which was a top ten NTM in 2016. I was very excited when this KS launched, even if I was a little worried that the games would be too similar to each other. Now that I have this, I know that - while there is certainly a close relationship - the experience of playing each is different enough to not feel redundant. While Paperback's mechanics are clearly derivative of Dominion, Hardback's mechanics are just as derivative of the Ascension/Star Realms model of deck building. That is, every card you acquire gives you points or money only when you play it and purchased cards belong to one of four genres that have abilities which activate only when a card of the same genre is played in the same word. (Yes, exactly like the scoring and faction abilities in Star Realms and similar games.)

Having said that, this does not feel at all like a Star Realms clone. First off, you need to create a word with a card in order to activate it and any card can be used as a wild if played face-down (but you don't get the benefits). The second big difference is that you are trying to build up your own points rather than reduce your opponents, so there is less of an "attacking" feel to Hardback and less interactivity. The bases in Star Realms are even replicated to a degree in the form of "Timeless Classic" cards, which remain from hand to hand granting benefits unless another player uses the card in their word in order to force it to be discarded. The game is good fun to be sure. There is one fairly original mechanic in the idea of "ink" and "ink remover". No cards in the Hardback allow you to draw extra cards. You always play with a hand of five unless you use an ink to draw an additional card. Cards drawn with ink are placed face-up and MUST be used in your word - which adds a bit of push-your-luck that you can leverage when your hand is crap. Horror genre cards can give you ink remover, which frees up an ink card to be used as a wild or not used at all.

My one potential criticism of Hardback is how the scoring works. The game ends when one player reaches 60 and both players have had the same amount of turns. Because you know how close the end is at all times, you want to make sure you get a big jump at about the 60 mark, so you can extend past 60 the furthest on the final turn. Manipulating those last couple of hands to maximize points gives them A LOT more weight than all other hands in the game. This, if anything, is why I might prefer Paperback over the long run, but both are certainly worth owning and playing.

Luckily the game relies heavily on deck building for success too. I can see how people would LOVE this. But the word game element pushes me away a bit.

We call it Word Realms since it's what you get if a word game and Star Realms had a baby. I like it a lot. It looks beautiful, plays smoothly, and is relatively easy to teach. I don't feel it replaces Paperback - they are both good deck-building, word-making games that reward different types of play.  I think choosing which game just depends on the group and mood. This is more likely with my gamer friends.

KS. Not the best word game ever. Not the best deck builder ever. But the hybrid of the two works very well together.

Any card can be played facedown as a wild, giving no rewards but ensuring that it is almost always possible to make a word (unless you mess things up spending ink).

A system of buying and spending ink tokens lets you push your luck to draw extra cards, but these letters *must* be used and cannot be played as wild.

Cards (beyond your starting deck) come from one of four genres, each with their own abilities and synergies.

Includes several variants, letting you add unique player powers (with a choice of friendly or hostile options), extra challenges, etc.

Probably the most important variant is solo/co-op play against a game-controlled character named Penny Dreadful. This doesn't work quite as well as the competitive game, in my opinion. The competitive game is more flexible, allowing for a variety of different playstyles, while the co-op favours a couple of particular tactics over others. Not bad, but not quite as good.

Very good game.  Similar to Star Realms mechanics.  A deck building game with spelling element.

Witness as different authors signed to various publishing companies write novels. There's a lot of genres to go around: Horror, Mystery, Romance and many more. Hardback is a great word game and the successor to Paperback. The learning curve is a bit steep but it's one of the better word games out there. If you like Scrabble or word games in general, you will thoroughly enjoy this game, as do I.

Played a game of this at PAX Unplugged 2017. Probably unfair to rate based on just one play, but I've played Paperback a bunch of times and this game fixes all of its problems and adds a little depth as well. Really enjoyed the possibility for all cards to be wild, as well as the ink/remover (though I never used the remover in the game I played). Based on my one play, I now strongly prefer this to Paperback and frankly I don't think I'll want to go back to Paperback (though up to this experience I had enjoyed that one quite a bit as well). For new players this may seem complicated at first but once they've done a turn or two they'll likely be surprised how intuitive everything is. Love it!

Edit: I forgot to add my one criticism of this game, which is similar to a criticism I had of Paperback and other games of this nature -- there's not much you can do to affect the other players in the game. It's pretty much multiplayer solitaire. I can appreciate this style of game but still think it would be nice if I could do at least something to hamper other players who are taking a big lead. Still love it though!

Awesome. So many layers. Even with 5 players, you are never waiting, as you scramble to create words out of your hand or try pushing your luck with the ink!

The game has some good mechanics and many more special powers/combos than paperback.  Drawing extra cards that become mandatory use is neat, and I like how you can store money inefficiently between turns.

However, I found it very repetitive.  It was too long, I was driven towards making the same words over and over.  And there is a lot of star-realms-style pressure to only buy from 2 factions, removing much choice about what to buy and removing strategic control.  You get into just doing the motions over and over, until someone finally wins.

Deckbuilder where you spell words to earn points and earn money to buy more letter cards.  Great if you love word games, otherwise, just meh...

Always nice to see a word game that doesn't reward two and three letter words. Like how the different genres influence play style. Like the push your luck element with drawing new cards. Not completely sold on starting each hand with 5 potential wilds, but this did not detract from the joys of finding big words with awkward letter combinations.

An improvement on paperback. Lot's of variety in play style with the different powers and combinations on the genre cards. Has wordplay for the word geeks and MEchanics play for the tactically minded. 

Will be cracking this out to play fairly often.

I much prefer this over its predecessor Paperback. Main reason is because feels more like a deck builder than a word game while Paperback was definitely word game first. Hardback is just more interesting to play for me. I love it.

Deck building mixed with scrabble type word game. It’s less stressing than scrabble as you can use cards a as a wild letter. Each card played as its depicted letter (not wild) grants you a combination of points, money, and special power. Points is straight up VP with game ending when someone reaches 60. 
Money let’s you buy new cards which expands your letter set and gives you more money/points/powers. 
Powers let you do special things such as reserving buy cards, trashing cards, etc. 

Game has a good mix of strategies, luck, and timing all while keeping the basic word game feel.

I like the game, but it took forever to play. Lots of think time while trying to come up with words. I thought the deck building aspect was cleverly done.

This is a sequel to the game, Paperback.  Even though the subtitle, at least on the Kickstarter game was "the pre-quill".  I don't know why it would be a prequel and the pun works just as well for sequel.  In any case they took the main pieces of Paperback and refined them and added some more interesting gameplay that makes this just overall a better game.  I got rid of my copy of Paperback and replaced it with this.

So like in Paperback players play a deckbuilding game where each round they make words with the letters in their hands and use the money earned to buy better more letters with better abilities.  The biggest addition from Paperback is they did the Legendary thing where each card is part of a genre such as Mystery or Romance and by playing 2 or more cards from the same genre it will activate additional abilities.

The game also looks really great, much better than Paperback.  Paperback was a very bland and drab game, except for the point cards everything was just brown and beige.  Each genre card in this is a different color with a different font (although a small nitpick is some fonts, especially the Romance one, make some letters difficult to read), each player point token is a little colored book, there are small ink and white-out tokens, just a much prettier and pleasing looking game than Paperback.

Where Paperback was “Dominion meets word games” this one is “Star Realms meets word games”. I prefer this game a lot more as there are a few rule tweaks to give me more control over what I can do on my turn.

Ascension+Scrabble.  Honestly, not my type of game, but still glad I backed.  I may not like word games a lot, but I bought this to try to get the Scrabble-only family members to try a new board game and this worked.  They're willing to replay Hardback and I'd much rather play this with them than Scrabble.

Have played only the PnP version so far, even though I backed the KS campaign and now have the real thing. Really, really enjoy it so far, as is. I don't like Scrabble much, but this is nothing like that. It's not even that close to its sister game, Paperback. It plays quickly (as each player can be working on their next turn as others take theirs), and is a nice departure from "normal" (non-word) games.

I was afraid I wouldn't enjoy this as much as Paperback, but so far so good! The new Wild card and Ink/Remover mechanisms are solid. I've always preferred the more exciting Star Realms/combo-heavy deckbuilders to the Dominion-style deckbuilders, anyway.

Rating is tentative and may go up with more plays, but it doesn't seem to quite hit the highs that Paperback did. Also it's longer. I'm torn because I prefer Star Realms/Ascension style chaining in deckbuilders over the Dominion style buys, but the combos in Hardback just aren't as interesting thus far.

Having said that I do enjoy the game quite a bit. I'm just not sure it dethrones Paperback.

This game was an instant hit. It does rely quite a bit on luck of the draw for the market, but being able to use any card as a wild really opens up the possibilities. It's a compact box and has minimal setup time. I can see this getting a lot of play.

Paperback is good and this makes it better.  It solves a lot of small issues by allowing wildcard letters to get out of vowel hose moments, and it adds depth with set collection of book genres for special ability combos, and unused pennies can buy ink for a nice push your luck element, and making it a race boosts the tension for max words ..... Well thought out stand alone expansion.

As one fellow owner of this game pointed out, Dominion : Paperback :: Star Realms : Hardback, and this really feels true. This is a quick, fun, deckbuilding word game, with good escalation. Ryan's art, as always, adds extreme appeal to the game. A number of variants and mini-expansions are also included.

I'm sure that, as with Star Realms, there are times that you feel like you can't get your preferred synergies happening, but wise accumulation of inkwells, and spending them as coins usually gets you right back into the game. In one game, one player was building a good lead, and I was gaining on her, optimistic about my chances… when another player whipped by us both for a big win. This is the kind of thing it's fun to see in a moderate- or short-length game.

Can't wait to play it more!

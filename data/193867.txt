I played a 5 player game of this last Saturday. Auctions, mergers, variable game starts, multiple scenarios this game has it all. Granted I've only had the one play of it but my first impression of it is that there is much more to explore in consecutive plays. Timing seems an important part of the strategies in this game. You don't want to make the mergers too soon and you definitely want to plan to buy the bigger and better trains. The game lasted 7.5 hrs but it felt like 2 hrs went by and no more. I thoroughly enjoyed myself the whole time. If you can handle the longer play time and your an 18xx fan you'll enjoy it.

[Update] My new favorite.  The addition of auction actions during the Stock rounds adds a layer of depth that is tense and entertaining.

After 2 plays:

Very much in the style of 18C2C, but simultaneously both more and less overhead going on. While there's overall fewer things to keep track of and manage, proportional to the size of the game there are a lot of mechanics early on to complicate things.

The central focus of the game seems to essentially boil down to: use minors to get > 60% of a company as efficiently as possible. There is an inherent tension here - if you get too good of a concession/company, everyone else will buy into it, such that you cannot get more than 50-60%. Settling for a second-tier company and making it your star player will go a lot further than getting the best company in the game. Gaining control of a second or third company is of course important - but primarily only as a means to dump good trains into your real company. Trying to make two of your companies run well through the train rush will likely spread your position too thin and put you behind.

I don't love this game, but I have to say, it's probably the best 18XX to come out since 1817 and 18NY.  

After 20 plays, I'm still finding a lot of inter-play variability.  The order that minors and concessions come out (and to a lesser extent, privates) drives the game in lots of different directions.  

It's got a good combination between stock market and track building play.  There's more room to affect the train rush than most games which is also neat.  

Finally, I think it plays well from 3 - 5 players (haven't tried it with 6).

One of the heavier and more involved 18XX titles that I've played, but one that potentially could have the longest legs and most to discover. 1822 offers a huge board and a massive pile of privates, minors, and majors to choose from. Companies are acquired using the delightful Lawson auction (think Amun Re) and most everything comes out in a random order, hence the replay.

There are numerous subtleties to consider in this game:
- Minors all have to have a train, but they also provide the best early game income and can be folded effectively into the majors so that said majors can have more railheads and range late in the game.

- Many of the privates have potentially game-breaking powers, but most of those powers rely on having the board built to specifically take advantage of them. I.e.: Passenger cars can be purchased that ride on a normal train. Those count small stops for income but don't count them against the train's range. If you build a network effectively that alone can easily add 70+ income to a run by itself. Other privates allow double builds, inexpensive builds, etc.

- Majors can't be floated directly at first, you have to buy a concession certificate and then wait until the next SR to convert it into 2 shares and work from there. This means there is a certain element of telegraphing when concessions are purchased.

- When minors are folded into majors, the owner of the minor can receive up to 2 additional shares in the major. Effectively this makes it possible, through a series of interconnected moves, to gain much more than the normal 60% ownership stake limit.

I won't belabor it any further, but this is just scratching the surface. There are a lot of mechanics to take in in this game though, and it's certainly too much for anyone who hasn't played at least 10+ other games in this series. For those who are interested in the 29 v. 30: this is much more of an operations game. You can try to trash out stock a bit, and it's sometimes the right choice, but running for 2X share value equals double jumps on the market, so a company that is in a good position can very easily recover from an attempted trashing.

Game length is on the moderately long side, but it's definitely playable in about 6 hours with reasonably snappy turns. I don't think that's a bad time length for the amount of depth this one offers. I will say though, that this is a title that would benefit a lot from repeat play, and would suffer the most without it. There are a lot of companies and powers to keep track of; having it in the regular rotation would make those easier to anticipate and take advantage of. Not a great game to buy if you only expect to get to it yearly or so IMO.

This does represent the beginners 18xx like a 1830 or 1889; the game has a lot of advanced mechanics that new players might feel overwhelmed with but one of the major issues stems from how to price the private, minor, and concessions/majors that can lead to overbidding or underbidding depending on the situation. It has less of a stock market focus than other games such as 1830 or 1849, and this game truly works best at the 5-6 player counts in my experience. 

Additionally, unlike most 18xx games, this game uses mini-hexes for the setup of the game, but it feels luxurious nonetheless. It has a large and expansive map that covers all of Great Britain and the railroads. 

For beginners learning the game, I would suggest somewhere between 6-8 hours minimum to complete the game, but with experienced 18xx players and players of 1822, you can complete the game in under five hours.

There are a lot of things to think about that one is not used to thinking about in an 18xx game; in particular, you need liquidity to bid for private companies especially.  Nothing is shocking in itself; it's how everything fits together that's different.

The bidding rules are a bit weird and extra but the myraid possibilities with the minor companies makes the game very worth it.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

RATING: 8
Really interesting. I think my favorite thing is how all of the auctions are happening at once and you can see what's coming up in future turns as well. As someone who doesn't play a lot of 18xx games, this made it easier for me to see what was going on and plan ahead than I feel like I usually can in other 18xx games. And some of the private companies have some interesting powers that you can use to do some cool stuff.

RATING: 10
This is one of my favorite 18xx games .  It has an interesting auction.  You bid for 24 minor companies, 18 privates and the right to start one of the 10 major companies.  The order they become available to bid on is mostly random.  This make each game different. Unlike most 18xx games where a minor company is not required to own a train this game requires every minor to have a train.  This can make the game stressful at times.  Merging minors into a major company is a great way to get more shares but you need to have the minor connected to the major by track.

My favorite 18XX so far.  I enjoy the focus on timing and operations and less focus on stock market shenanigans (although of course you need to still be mindful of that).  It's complex but seems to all make sense.  Played twice now PBEM.

Solid game although the auctions each round can go on a bit long. A lot to take in, but nothing that's too much to handle. I'd like to try it again, but I really need to be able to read the rules and play it correctly instead of going off of what Mike says is correct.

Only one play in, but a little too complicated for me. Hard to keep track of all of the privates and auctions. Probably would like it more with repeated play, but I have little enough 18xx time as it is.

Great, epic 18xx game; after one play, it feels a little too short. Would have liked one or two more sets of ORs (track wasn't developed enough, one coop just unstarted, much space left on the stock market chart).

Best auction system of all 18XX games.  A few flaws, such as some unplayable minors and the way company concessions get discarded when the 5 train is purchased, but overall the game has a huge amount of replay value due to the auction and random order in which the minors and privates become available.  The value of the minors, private companies, and concessions varies a great deal depending on when they are up for bid and what else is available.  This game is won primarily due to evaluating opportunities and bidding the best deals during the auctions.

In many cases the game can be won by letting someone over pay for something, leaving them cash poor for the next stock round and unable to compete for more valuable opportunities.

This is up there as my all time favourite XX titles and is certainly the most replayable. The auction mechanism is what makes this a true stand out as the sets that come out will change every game and so the value you place on them will change with each play.
      The mid length scenario option is perfect for an evenings play and scales very well with two players which is an added bonus.
       I cannot recommend this game enough. This is a must have for any dedicated XX player.

Not ready to give a rating after one play, but initial impression was better than the other operations-focused/run-good-companies type 18xx games that I've played. Auctions in each stock round are a nice addition. I like the idea of minor companies opening the game and later folding in to majors in theory, but haven't seen it executed in a way that grabs me.

I had a hard time comprehending this one but I think I liked it? I definitely need to play it more, but I'm looking forward to that, so I guess that's a good sign.

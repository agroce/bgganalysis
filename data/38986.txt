This was my first ever 18xx. Lots of very interesting economic manipulation and spatial arrangement things going on here. My biggest gripe is the the last half or third really seemed to drag on with fewer and fewer interesing or meaningful decisions to make. The beginning is so full of opportunities while the end is just too min/max-y.

+ Shorter game in a very constricted map. Some interesting rules changes.
- I'm not sure about the replayability of this one. The map asks for a scripted tile-laying.

pretty short for a 18XX (about 4 hours without explanation). When you're used to play regular 18xx's I was very surprised by the fast development of trains.

UPDATE [3.18.16] - 18NEB components arrived!!!.  Can't wait to try.  Really am excited to try this as a 2P game.  Rating downgrade (-0.1) because 18Dixie is awesome.

[2.6.16] - 18NEB ordered via Golden Spike Games.  ETA - March 2016!  Woot Woot!

[8.20.14] - My 2nd 18xx victory.  Got to play a 3 player game.  This is a simple 18xx game in comparison to the other's that I've played.  The linear stock market makes the financial side of the game simple.  I like the train mix in this game. The trains that come available at the end of the game, in addition to revenue payouts that can lead to company stock prices taking multiple jumps seem to be a nice way to either catch up or run away with the lead.  I like how towns can turn into cities creating this tension of "is my EW run going to get cut out at some point in the game."
[10.15.15] - This game was just enjoyable to play.  I'm sure if I played it more it could get boring, but when I did play it I had a blast, and the game never dragged.

Initial impression:

This seems to span both teaching/early developmental/short game ideals, all the way up to having the ability to manipulate the situation in very deep ways.

I was very surprised by how much I liked this game on first play.  It's perhaps not the best teaching game, but the basics are simple, logical, without a lot of the exceptions that new players are forced to memorize in many other teaching games, which makes it ideal for playing to the 5-trains, quitting, and starting again another time, for a full game.

Good 18xx game. I like the easy the game flows. It has some good features and it plays really fast. The only thing that worries me is the fact that it seems hard to pass the companies to other players. Need to play it again soon.

RATING: 6
A good title, better than 18AL and 18GA, but I've been having some second thoughts about this game: it seems too focused on E-W routes, and most companies manage to get one...

RATING: 4
 I'm not sure how much replayability it will have, but after one play, the map has me intrigued. Single dits that upgrade to single hole cities that upgrade to 2-hole cities makes for an interesting early track laying exercise. The Credit Mobilier encourages one player to lay track just for the heck of it which also encourages the board to fill up quickly. I'm not sure if the game will top 4 or 5 plays, but it is interesting for a few plays. 

Other thoughts: the Lawson tiles and the double track lays make the game relatively easy to get routes. It may be because the last company didn't start, but the board felt pretty wide open. 

The Credit Mobilier felt pretty strong, giving me lots of cash ($5/track lay) despite the fact that I never got around to selling it to a company. 

Timing the first 3T purchase is critical because it can leave you tokened out of towns that grow up to cities. I think the UP wants to try to force the lowest company to break the 3Ts so it can upgrade a dit to green and get a token out. Or, if it has the bridge, it can head south. 

Yep, interesting map for a few plays.

Short, which is its main selling point. All about the token placement. I'd rather play a different 18xx game though.

I really liked the character of this 18XX. Interesting privates, minors, nice East-West bonus that, when combined with town upgrades, makes for some very cool (and mean) moments. The capitalization scheme is interesting too. Alas, we totally misplayed it - no selling to the pool - so we stalled early with a bunch of cash-starved companies. I'm still very new to 18XX, but this one seems like a nice fit for me. Looking forward to trying again.

RATING: 4
The private auction ensures that not only do the privates sell for value, but that they do so predictably; the handling of priority optimises for stock-market action efficiency rather than investment acumen; the Lawson track is excessively generous; the upgraded town tokening is simply inevitably predictable; the late-game minors are so obviously good or bad that there is no investment decision; and all the the runs will always go east-west on the overly generous track.

Pablum of the least interesting sort.

Another 18xx game that hits it out of the park for me with early playings. I look forward to my pre-order and the opportunity to play this one more.

After a single play, I put this game in the top tier of 18xx titles I enjoy, with 1860 and 1846. It feels unique though. 

The town upgrades into single station cities that won't be upgraded to more slots can make for some real battles for tokening and route-laying that makes the game extra juicy.

18Neb is not necessarily bad, its just that, in the quest to shorten the gameâ€™s playtime some essential items were removed that normally make 18XXs such a joy to play. As it is, the interplay variability of this one is too low for it to be worth keeping in my relatively lean 18XX collection. If you would like to have a larger collection of 18XX games I could see keeping this one around for periodic play, but I do not, so it was gotten rid of.

RATING: 8
Small map, quick playing time, must be boring, right? Wrong. This is a vicious little gem that packs quite a wallop in a small package. Rules are pretty straightforward with a few twists and the small maps insures that there will be some vicious tokening.

Worth playing, and not only if you don't have the time for some of the bigger games.

Would probably be a 8.5 if we could get the playing time down to 3-4 hours.  First play clocked in at 8 hours and technically would have went another hour at minimum (the leader was running away with a win, so we called it early).

This game has highly interactive board play, but I thought the stock market was uninteresting.  If a game is going to use a 2-dimensional stock market, the stock market ought to be more interesting than this one is.

RATING: 8
This is a game that gets very stale with repeated plays.  It's a fun little package, but compared to '46, there isn't much variety - there are 3 "great" companies (i.e. the UP, the CS, and the first guy into Omaha in green), and everyone else is crap.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is my favorite 18xx. It can be played in a reasonable amount of time, yet has enough interesting decisions to be surprisingly deep. The ability to token east/west routes as towns grow up also provides plenty of excitement. 18NEB is a new classic in the genre. (Note that I'm listed as a developer and my brother is the designer, so I may be just a tad biased.)

RATING: 9
Lots of sharp edges to use on your opponents while trying to maneuver around yourself.  Many strategies are non-obvious on the first play, and the 5-share companies are more capable than they might appear at first.  Rating likely to go up with more plays.  Best 18xx I've ever played with 3p.

RATING: 2
There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's a very simple game as 18xx games go: there is no par price, the map is small (just under 50 user-modifiable hexes), it uses Lawson track so the number of tiles in the box are greatly reduced since you can turn your trains in any direction from the center of non-city tracks (and so don't need tons of variations of brown curvy track) and the bank is small (6000$).

Yet it still gives players tons of options, you can split payments but not without consequence since if you don't at least pay out the current value of the stock to shareholders the price per share doesn't move, also the unsold stock are held by the company and on one's turn you can have the company sell some stock to the pool (thus reducing the price) and then immediately buy one at the reduced price.

All the differences from the standard 18xx  rules (e.g. 1889 rules) make the game more thematic and thus make it easier to learn.

RATING: 9
Played in Sept 2014 (3 players) and again in Oct 2015 (4 players).

Oct 2015: excellent experience, great dynamics, quite a long game, though (a bit over 5 hours).  Only 2 18xx players around the table.

For me, the best choices have been made by the designer regarding rules: incremental funding, president has choice of trains when in emergency fund raising, priority deal allocation method, private auction, Lawson-type tiles, etc.

I definitely recommend, and I think this can easily work with 18xx beginners.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a nice compact 18xx with plenty of options and variability.  It features cruel cut-off play, the potential for stock shennanigans, and plenty of room for just operating a company well.

I'd happily play again, given a chance.

[b][thing=38986][/thing][/b] turns out to be a bit more interesting of a game than I anticipated.  As a place, Nebraska lacks the exoticness of China ([thing=69601]1880[/thing]) or breadth of Russia ([thing=23817]1861[/thing]) or the grit of industrial England ([thing=937]1825[/thing]).  I figured the game, with it's lack of any original mechanics, would be rather bland.  But it turns out to be quite enjoyable.

Good 3P 18xx.  Small map, lots of chance for messing with opponents.  

I like the Priority Deal mechanism in this one:  PD goes to first to pass, to be followed by second person to pass, etc.

The market is not very dynamic.  

I do like the dot towns to cities upgrades.  This does provide some opportunity for screwage (I've been on both ends of that sword). 

This is not my favorite 18xx, but I like it.  Our group needs to get the play time down though.

I actually kind of 'got' this one.  I like the museum lines, and the growth of the towns.  Lots of chances to manipulate routes in at least semi-clever ways.  One of the better 18xx games I've played.

A well thought out "small" 18XX. In complexity and length its in the same league as other one-state games. 

However it is a partial capitalization game and it plays very differently from Mark Derrick's one-state games. It is the first partial capitalization game that made me eager to play again.  I finally realized the defense against your opponents trashing your stock: buy it back into the corp! Having your corp's shares sit in the bank pool will hurt you.

It has some fascinating innovations.  The priority deal mechanism and the initial auction are both excellent.  

It is in large part a track-laying game.  Players fight for the best routes with some new tile-upgrading rules that make blocking and re-routing both possible.  The stock market however is somewhat steep (again, compared to the Mark Derrick designs) so share value is at least as important as earnings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tiny map, larger trains and a consistent flow of trains disappearing. I really liked it. Not sure how much room there is for creative play, but upgrading towns to cities is interesting, especially when you have a lot of n+m trains and need the whistle stops.

Update: So far my biggest issue with this game is that the stock market is rather boring. Yes, prices fluctuate, but there are no yellow companies, no double jumps and not much else going on. Really, it could have been a 2D market and been the same game. We'll see as time goes by, but so far, meh on the stock market portion.

As 18xx titles go, I found this to be mostly uninteresting.  The two main gimmicks here are the dit>town tile upgrades and the priority deal based on the order players passed.

Another short, compact 18xx title, good for a weeknight play. There are a few twists in this one that make it pretty intriguing. The major one is that you can issue shares to raise capital for your company. However, unlike 1846 where you issue shares in the OR right before you (for example) purchase a train, in 18NEB you issue shares *during a stock round.* Timing the train rush is a little more challenging when you have to look ahead a little bit more: issue shares now on the offchance there's a 5T waiting for you, but drop your own stock value in the process? Or keep the value high and hope that the last 4T is there when it's your turn, depending on what your opponent is doing right before you operate? That's a nice pairing with a partial-cap game. 

It's also a mean token game, as you can upgrade towns and place a surprise token there, messing up someone's route. 

The local companies are interesting, but since they only run rusted trains, I'm not sure if they're viable or if they're just intended to give people something to do after they're functionally eliminated but not quite bankrupt. 

Enjoyable. Want to play.

My second 18xx game. Took 6+ hours and I knew I was doomed about halfway through. Still had a ton of fun though. 18NEB seems like a fine version although overall it doesn't stand out enough to want me to pick it up over others.

RATING: 7
The upside:
-I dig the E-W bonus on this game, like the 'K' bonus on 1848, which is a way of rewarding companies who work on the routes that would make the most sense for the setting.
-Despite several differencest o the core of 18xx, I still think this is one of the best as introductory game.

The downside:
-The map looks unchallenging, and it's easy to come with highways for your trains.

I've heard plenty of good things about this game.  However, when we played, we did not find it particularly enjoyable.  In fact, we called the game long before the end because we tired of it.  I would like to give it another try someday, but that may be a while.  There are plenty of other 18xx games to try before then, not to mention playing some we know that we will enjoy.

I was finally able to give this game another play, this time without any rule errors and with some moderately experienced players.  The game was much, much different than I had previously expected.  Based on comments by the other players (who had played before) there were some areas of play that were somewhat scripted.  Still, it was quite pleasant.  I'm happy I gave this game a second go.

This works almost like a preliminary rating as I've only played the game once. It really shined with 3 players. The balance between control and risk is very good as you may wait for the dumping but often you seem to have the situation under control, which I prefer. The way players have the option to capitalize the company is excelent and, also excelent, seemed to be the small companies, which distribute 100% in 4 papers only. 
Nice small game with the certain tweaks.

Replayability seems to be an issue as we've played the game twice in one week and the results were too close. The map is steady but dull as it seems to have nothing but obvious decisions. Still a good game to visit ocasionally.

Played this at BGGCON08 with the designer.  It still needs a few final touches, but I enjoyed it quite a bit as is.  I definitely hope this one makes it to production so I can buy a copy.

One of the more unique things about this game is the small towns that can be upgraded and then tokened.  I have not had the opportunity to play a lot of 18xx games, but my understanding is there are a few other games where this can happen.  In this particular case, the sheer number of small towns makes the game very tense because your routes are very susceptible to aggressive tokening.  Only the threat of someone returning the favor keeps you from being too aggressive, very cold war like.

A single state 18xx with bells and whistles. Board starts with no cities, priority per passing order, local companies that run rusted trains, etc.

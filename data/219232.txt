GAME: Ilôs
RANK: 4736
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Ilôs is a cute little game trying to entice players with some tile laying and exploration, but at it's heart is a mere resource generation system where you get to influence the value of those resources for end game scoring.
The core mechanism is a card driven action system, where you have to pay for your action cards by discarding other cards.
Ilôs seem to promise something good, but in the end the game is a bit dull and unexciting: it isn’t flawed, it's kind of enjoyable but also... forgettable...

Pretty modular board game mixing exploration with resource gathering and a market mechanism. Each game develops differently.

Easy and fast to play filler game. Hard to return if you get behind and maybe a little bit to much luck driven.

Good looking components, short length and quick enough turns. Maybe a bit harder to get more cards would make things more interesting - now it's too easy to get a lot of them. Nice filler anyhow which I'm ready to play anytime.

Filler+ with exploring, Easilly 30 min with 2 players. Quite flat but enjoyable as a short game if you like exploration.

My feelings after my one play was: why did they cut down some trees to produce this? There is really no excitement, nu fun at all in this game.

Surprised by this one. Quick plays even for 5 players and it really packs a punch. You have to manage your hand and watch the market carefully. I warn you about boat placement and to not cover any locations on the board. We had issues with that. Otherwise I had a great time playing and look forward to my next play.

tl;dr: nothing new to see here, move along

This game has some tile laying with an exploration aspect, but at it's heart is a resource generation system where you get to influence the value of those resources for end game scoring. It all runs on a card mechanism where you have to pay for your action cards by discarding other cards. So it has a lot of things going for it. I quite like what they were going for, but in the end the game fails to excite. It works, it's kind of enjoyable but also quite forgettable. I was hoping for more but only got middle of the road.

Flows surprisingly quickly. Actions are paid by discarding action cards from hand. As ships give more cards, the selection is never too restricted. Goods are valued on a collective market, where you have to discard a token to increase the value.

The game works and I understand what to accomplish. But it felt very flat. Choices are obvious and player interaction is not that engaging.

Pas mon genre de jeu. Système confus, plateau peu lisible, principe des actions un peu lourd et, surtout, un manque total d'interactivité : chaque joueur bricole dans son coin sans de vraies possibilités de gêner les autres (le principe de la piraterie est anodin et sans conséquences).

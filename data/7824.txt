A co-op game, for kids! It's cool that it has a real-time element, in that you have to win the game before timr runs out; it puts the pressure on without threatening individual players with elimination.

Enjoyable for a kid's game, the ticking clock adds tension and ensures you'll be done fairly quickly one way or another.

Can easily flare tempers if everyone isn't paying attention. "Roll the damn dice! NOW!"

The kids really have fun playing this game and it's fun enough for grownups to play if played in the spirit of the game.

{1 play • 4 player} Wanted to like it more since the idea sounds cool and it's beautifully produced... but it really fell flat.  Plus, even if it had been better, I can't see this getting repeat plays.  Might be great for age 8+ kids, though.

Belongs to my children.

Picked this up for my son though it will be years yet before he is able to play. As I showed it off to my wife, telling her how much fun I think he will have playing it, we decided we'd better play it.  Great fun--we succeeded but only with 32 seconds on the clock.  Played three times with kids from work and they love it.  The timer creates a nice tension that can bring all the players together to cooperatively create plans.

Update: often requested game by my son these days. A really enjoyable experience that I highly recommend to parents of children age 4+.

My first game I started out dominating and thought that it would be way too easy, but when the guard and the dog started patrolling, continually being thrown in jail slowed me down enough to end up losing the game.
I'm glad I lost. A good 'co-op against game' should have defeat remain a very real possibility. We'll see if this game keeps my respect or looses it over time.

RATING: 5
The idea is all the players are on the same team, so you all win or all lose effectively. The game is set to 30 minutes long for four players. As you are against the clock then it encourages fast play, but a few tactical decisions are important and slow you down as you disagree. The two baddies (guard and dog) can catch you pretty easily and can make the game quite difficult. You do waste a bit of time on your first few plays checking rules and such. The two dice mechanics (one for baddies, one for players is a bit of a nuisance). In my opinion if you want to play a 30 minute team co-op game Forbidden Island is better.

Easy for smaller kids to get their head round, and you get to quarterback them as you cheer them on to beat the timer. Eldest asked for this regularly at 5yrs old. Holding onto until he or youngest get tired of it and move on to better Co-ops.

RATING: 6
A cooperative family game that guarantees play in thirty minutes or less. This is a great time, honestly! Ensuring you get the goods when you need them and avoiding the guard all the while and frantically rolling the dice to unlock the doors...it's a fun, fast game that I pull out from time to time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Sure there is pure luck in the dice-rolling, but the ticking clock makes the game intense and enjoyable.  An excellent family game since it's cooperative and everyone wins or loses together.  Something about the cooperative play and the pressure of the time slowly ticking away makes me enjoy it much more than I probably should.  The most annoying part is just remembering to move and having to count out the spaces for the Guard and Watchdog movements.

RATING: 5
Entertaining team game that clocks in at under half an hour.  Luck plays a factor, and slow players are a detriment, but this is an optimal choice for families.  Your gamer group will play once, have fun, and be done with it.

My 7 yr. old loves cooperative games right now and this one has gone over very well with him.  Fun family game with a built in time limit.  The game can get pretty tense in the last few minutes -- especially if you're trying to get to the finish line while dodging the guard or the dog.  Lost our most recent game because I kept getting tossed in jail during the last 3 minutes.  BAH!

Rating isn't really fair: this is actually a decent co-operative game for kids. But unlike some other simple co-op games, there really isn't much value to be found for older gamers so my personal rating is quite low.

Rules are pretty simple, and based around the familiar roll-and-move concept. There a hard time limit so you always know the maximum length of the game going in. Quite a bit of luck involved.

Happy to play with my kids or young nephews, not something I would play without them sitting at the table.

This is a fun cooperative but we find ourselves practically shouting instructions at each other and handing off the dice as fast as we can.

I've never played a game quite like this.  It is not just a game, it is an experience.  At first the clock thing just seems like a gimmick, but as it begins beeping down your time suddenly the players are fused together into unit determined to move quickly to beat that clock!  It is tense, exciting, and fun -- especially with kids.  Like any game with similar cooperative dynamics, this one has the possibility having some bossiness or even hurt feelings.  Group dynamics are important here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As a friend put it: "This game is just stupid enough to be fun." And that about says it. I will gladly play this when I'm in the mood for something silly - and it's surprisingly challenging to actually win the damn thing! It's a cooperative family game where you're sneaking around Evil Guy Compound (pause and reflect on the creativity required for that name) where you have to avoid the security guard and the guard dog. You're trying to break into some super impenetrable safe that requires 4 keys (like I said, impenetrable) in order to get the documents for Evil Guy Operations (again, take your time and savor that). [i]Dude, hurry up and roll the dice![/i]

But -- oops! -- you tripped the self-destruct wire on the way in so you have a countdown (30 minutes with 4P/22 minutes with 3P) till the facility self-destructs. Did I mention it's the security guard's last day before retirement? Through expert dice rolling and keen use of action cards (ahem), you must make decisions in real time as the timer counts down. You [i]will[/i] get caught and thrown in the holding cell, but you or your team members can get you out again. [i]Dude, hurry up and roll the dice![/i]

You will roll dice and move pieces on the board frantically, curse your luck at how often the guard and dog manage to catch you, and be stupefied that you got beat by this stupid children's game. And then you'll want to play again to see if you can Break ... the... eh, I forget the rest. [i]Dude, hurry up and roll the dice![/i]

Note: game seriously enhanced under the influence of alcohol.

Very good family cooperative game. Loads of tension when that clock is getting close to zero. Some light strategy involved, but because the clock is ticking, you can't ponder for long! I imagine this would be easy to tweak with house rules for even more strategic choices. Adults can play with kids as young as 4 or 5, if you help them out.

Also, it introduces some key concepts like range (guard dog), line of sight (guard), quickest path from A to B, calculated risks (odds of the dog/guard reaching a certain square), no-man-left-behind teamwork (free the other player from jail), and logic sequences (passing the robot to a player so that player can pass a needed card to a third player).

Not recommended for teenager/adult-only play unless you'd get a kick out of trying to break time records.

This is a fantastic kids game. My 7 year old is in love with this game. It's easily his favorite. I often have fun playing this one too. The game clock ticking away adds an awesome amount of tension. Especially if you are really close to winning, and get under a minute to go. Rolling the dice, and passing them along, while moving all the players on the board gets really frantic and exciting. Highly recommend this for anyone with kids between 6 and 12. So fun!

Unusually good game for a roll-and-move coop -- there is a decent number of meaningful decisions in the game, and good opportunities for teamwork.  The timer really keeps things under pressure and forces people to work together.  The guard and dog AI feels natural, and I like how they move on separate dice from the player.  It feels "right".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is a fun, lighthearted game, that is completely killed by the timer. Cooperative games should have a sense of urgency brought on by the events, not by forcing you to make strategic desicions in seconds. Maybe that's your cup of tea, but it isn't mine. If they nixed the timer and threw in an easier way for the guard to win, this would be a sweet game. Also, scales very poorly: playing with 2 is absurdly easy. Oh well, at least the pain only lasts 30 minutes.

Wow!  That is a fairly intense co-op game!  I just played this with my family and man, we were all hyped trying to get the mission completed before the countdown ran out!   Unfortunately, everyone was back at the vault but I was too far away, so we lost. This is a fun game for sure, but I see how a game could be mediocre with a few too many 'good' rolls which will result in a non-challenging game.  In our game, the beginning turns were encumbered by encounters with security and we could not get out of the jail for the first half of the game.  
The game is 30 minutes long as set by the timer (22 for three, 15 for two).  8 tokens are placed in rooms around the board and 4 of them are keys.  You must all work as a team to get the 4 keys and return to the vault before the time runs out.  The timer gives you audible cues as the time is counting down.  This adds to the anxiety.  Along with the 8 tokens are 8 booby traps.  There are 7 tools to remove 7 traps while the 8th requires two agents in the room to disarm.  The trick is, the 7 remedies and a few special tools to assist you are distributed prior to the game starting.  Thus, you may encounter a trap for which another player has the remedy.  You can exchange a card if you have the robot with you, but you can only do so on your turn.  Meanwhile, a guard and dog roam the halls trying to capture your team and put them in jail.  I really enjoyed this game, as did my wife and two daughters.  The game play is simple.  The rules are simple.  The outcome is unpredictable.  I certainly recommend this one, especially if you have teen or younger kids and this is certainly one for non-gamers.  I enjoy this game for what it is and will certainly pull it out when the opportunity arises.

An entertaining co-operative game for families with younger children. As with most co-ops where you play together against a random game setup, winning is largely luck based as a favourable distribution of tiles and die rolls ensures success. The time limit adds sufficient tension to make the attempt well worthwhile though.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (December 2017)

I don’t know why I bought Break the Safe, I bought it on 2015, hopefully, I think I have become a bit better when I buy games for me. It is clearly not a game I would want to play, but when a friend requested the game I was happy to play it. It is a very light game with lots of luck. It is, definitively, not a game for me.

Break the Safe´s rules are pretty easy to teach, you can do so under 3 minutes. Playtime is around 30 minutes due to the timer.

The theme is kind of nice.

The game´s components are very good for a game this old. As my friend was explaining the rules, I really thought you needed to physically place the keys on the device and I was getting excited, but as it turned out, the electronic device is only a 30 minute timer, nothing else.

Gameplay is very unsatisfying, in each turn you roll the dice to see how much can you move and to see how much the guard and the dog will move. If you manage to reach a room, you can try to pick up the object, sometimes, you need another item to do so. The decisions needed to do all this are almost nonexistent. All the decisions are obvious and luck reigns supreme.

In our play we finished it with lots of time left, but if you lose it is only due to bad luck, however, I’m having a hard time imagining losing this game, there is no challenge here.

Bottom line, Break the Safe is a good children game, but it isn’t a game for me. I would have loved the game as a child, but I already sold it. It has lots of luck and the decisions are obvious. Boring game for adults.

A cooperative family game that makes for a fun, suspenseful 30 minutes.  Watch everyone roll frantically as the digital timer ticks down.  The fixed time limit prevents the game from overstaying its welcome.  Rules are short, but poorly organized, leaving several grey areas.  Would a turn summary be too much to ask for?

RATING: 5
Roll and move game that has some initial charm, but gets old quick. Game plays in real time (with a timer) so there is some urgency. I have found that by making liberal use of the secret passages, the game gets a lot easier. My son requested this a lot when he was 5.

This family game comes ever-so-close to being a really good game.  
We lost our first play with three people even though we played for the 30 minute limit instead of 22 minutes. There were few tough decisions, just taking chances and then the dice work for you or against you.
I believe we can find a house rule or a change in mechanisms to make it much better.

Really great kid-friendly game - it oozes with theme, the timer is fantastic, and everything is colorful and well illustrated. The game is well-designed in that it's never a sure thing, and it can get pretty hectic towards the end. Highly recommended if you have a couple of 5-to-8 year olds running around who need something to take them away from the video game console.

Enjoy playing this game with the kids. The electronic timer adds loads of tension to this co-op and the kids love the minis. Frantic dice rolling is fun. Been a staple in our collection over the years. Great value for money since it was a $2 thrift store find.
Update: Donated in 2018. Kids have grown of it and have other real-time games which replace it now. I think it's one of there best intros to real-time games for kids though and saw its through many years of fun.

More like a Fisher-Price plastic donut toy than a game.

I can't believe anyone older than maybe 10 would enjoy playing this game.  The thing is, I was suckered into playing it a few months ago (for the first time), by a college student in a board game club who bothered to bring it with him and claimed that it was okay.  It was HORRIBLE.  Really makes me wonder about the guy.  The game eats some batteries too.  I'd have MUCH rather played "Cooties" or "Don't Break the Ice" than this pile of garbage.

RATING: 6
This one is almost good enough to recommend as a gateway game for kids and Hasbro-blinkered yanks who'd like to experience a true co-op, but don't quite yet have the mojo for BATTLESTAR GALACTICA or LORD OF THE RINGS. The pieces and the board are attractive, the rules are just fussy enough to engage the mind a bit (though they're very sloppily written), and the feeling of being under time pressure as you dodge around corners looking for keys to a safe can get very exciting, especially as the electronic timer ticks inexorably away. Unfortunately, the guard and dog mechanics are just a bit too random, causing what otherwise might be a tense, dramatic endgame to inevitably devolve into dice-watching spree.

I'm always looking for games that have a different element to them, which is why I picked up this game.I have only played it three times so far. I just played a two player game a couple of days ago and we set the timer for 30 minutes even though the directions suggest that the timer be set for 15 minutes while playing with two people. We got through the game in 17 minutes. I suggest that those who are thinking of picking up this game play it without the timer first just to get the feel for the game. Although its a roll and move game, you also have to roll and move for the guard and the guard dog, exchange cards back and forth while trying to avoid being caught by the guard or guard dog. It's a fun family game.

RATING: 7
I am rating this as a 7 since my son is nuts about it. The only problem is there are annoying holes in the rules, but you can work it out.  My son does not like to lose to another person and so if you lose on this game, everyone loses. He really gets into the atmosphere of dodging the guard, racing to the next room, using the gadgets on the booby trap, and loves to send the robot back and forth.He gets a kick out of trying to rescue each other from jail. I think the timer adds a great tension element to the game. Without it the game would not be as good. The bits, pawns, unique dice, and the timer are well made, and the game box has nice pockets to store every item, very shipshape.

Can be lots of fun with my kids.  The timer makes it more difficult than it would seem at first.  It's agonizing to have one minute left and be sitting in jail while the others are back to the safe.  Stupid jail!  It's more difficult with more players, very easy with 2 once you have played it even once.  My rating dropped after a dozen and a half games because I'm tired of it, but my kids still love it and request it all the time - part of the reason I'm tired of it.

RATING: 5
Not a bad little game to play with the kids. It's a little random, but the randomness seems to work pretty well. A lot depends on the movement of the guard and the dog. Sometimes they barely come out of their stations, sometimes they wander around for quite a while. My son and I have played enough now that we do just fine with a 15-minute timer. We used to keep making stupid mistakes, like not utilizing the secret passages enough, or forgetting to play useful cards (see my session report for how I cost us a win by forgetting about the jet board card I had).

The rules call for the secret agent pawns to begin in the center of the start/finish room and also for the safe/timer to begin in the center of the start/finish room. What?

2-4 players, the instructions say it plays ideally with four, but I don't know if I agree.  Played a couple times and it's pretty fun.  Cooperative game where everyone wins or loses.  Plays in a half-hour or under, which is a nice bonus as you can get in a quick game before or after playing something else. Very swingy; not a "serious" strategy game. I'd probably play Escape: Curse of the Temple over this.

Enjoy this co-op with the kids (6 and 4) - the simple timer adds tension and is central to the game.  Moving the guard and dog once they get woken up is a full time job.  Eleven spaces each?!  Like that they have different detection mechanics too (LOS vs. "smell").

Edit: This one has grown on us over one and still gets played.  Had a particularly epic game last night where my daughter just squeaked out her escape as the timer beeped down its final countdown.  Nice!

"Surprisingly good electronic 'kids' game from 2003 that works fine with non-serious adults. As a real-time game where you roll dice and move around, it has a feel similar to Escape. But BtS is much more swingy."

What I like:
- Theme is great
- Gameplay is fast, but not as frantic as Escape
- Components are mostly very good quality

What I don't like:
- The randomness is very high
- Roll-and-move, although it works well here
- A few rules seem a bit awkward
- The "booby trap" chits are very thin
- The card aren't great, but they are hardly used, so should be fine

The electronic timer is really just a countdown timer, beeping every minute, with extra beeps at 5-minute marks, and then every second for the last minute. So the game would still be very playable without it--just use any countdown timer. 

This game is very swingy, so you might have no chance, or it might be an cake walk. But either way, it's just plain fun. Rushing to roll the dice, and move up to 3 pawns accordingly, and remembering when to use your tools (especially the robot) is a pleasant chaos. It is light, but there are absolutely some decisions to make. I'll agree with the BGG-voted 1.5 weight. 

My wife and I enjoyed it, with no kids in sight. I suspect it would be even better with more players, and/or with some young ones involved. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a great co-op game! It is simpler than many of the newer co-ops but this one can become quite tense since the game has a timer which the players can see counting down. The built-in security officer and dog moving around the board can be frustrating but it adds to the excitement.

This is a great game for a fun 30 minutes when you want a well themed game that gets your heard pounding.  We start the clock at 22 minutes for a 4 player game if everyone has played before because winning with 5 minutes to go isn't all that fun.  It is the second by second beep of the timer with 30 seconds to go and one player yet to make it back to the safe that makes the game.  The Mattel logo on the side made me sceptical, but they came through with a winner for kids.

Dull roll die and move your agent (and activated dog and guard)mechanic, with the excitement coming from the timer countdown gadget. Played twice with two but suspect it would be more chaotic (fun) and tense with 4 players. Not bad, very strongly themed co-operative but lacks replay value once you have beaten the game. No doubt the kids will really like it. If only cards were used instead of dice...

Ranked as a game to play with pre-teens.  This game can be a blast.  It's fun to watch as the kids get flustered as the timer reaches 5 minutes or below.  
The rules are a bit unclear, and the movement roles for the guard and his dog can be hard to get perfect, but just sit back and watch as the tension multiplies.
Several of our games have come down to seconds left for unlocking the safe...  with our final game being a free-for-all as the three of us nearly tried to throw the keys into place before time ran out.

This game is all about the theme and the tension of trying to beat the clock. Without the constant reminder of the time limit, this would be just another roll-and-move game, but the timer keeps it interesting. The cooperative nature is a nice change of pace from most games, and the limited time means that you are assured of finishing within 30 minutes (or 22, or 15, depending on the number of players). I think it plays just as well, if not better, with two players as four.

This was my sons favourite game for YEARS and if he forgot to take it to school on a rainy day you could be sure the office would ring me to ask if I could bring it in for the kids to play at lunch!

It's a simple roll & move co-op, but you also have to avoid the dog and guard which can send you to jail, and are racing against the clock to find keys which can get pretty exciting .. It can also be made more challenging by reducing the time (30-22-15min) or removing some of the cards (eg: the four that effect the guard & dog)

Very fun family game with lots of tension at the end as players try to get back to the safe before the 30 minute timer runs out. Works for kids 4 and up. Plays best with 4.

I'm missing the safe! The one crucial game piece & I don't even have it. So it goes without saying that I can't even play this game & the joke must be said when I say someone has already "broken my safe!" :)

Its a fun family co op game that only takes 30 minutes or less.  We love the tension that the timer sets during game play.  Its a well thought out game that we will play for a long time.

Surprisingly good cooperative game. I find it challenging and fun. I have yet to win after numerous plays with my kids and their friends.

We keep coming back to his one. My favorite coop. Great theme...really captures what you are doing, and putting it on a timer makes it tense, but no the overwhelming. Someone needs to remake it as a more "grown up" version with better artwork and more clear rules.

Based on one play.  Players end up skipping turns a lot, which can be very frustrating, but the coorperation, and especially the timer which ensures this will be a 30min or less game, keeps this fun.

Brings back memories of frantic rolling in the last minute. Escape: The curse of the temple does it much better, but this one is simpler for kids.

A classic. Quick, easy to learn, and hilariously fun. I've never played a dull game of this.

A fun quick playing team game for with the kids (even my 5 year old loves it) - the huge ticking safe (does it really need 3 batteries to power it though?!) really adds atmosphere.

Love to play this one with my kids. I have a 7 and 4 year old and this game is just long enough for both of them. It would be light for older/experienced players put still good family fun.

About as solid a school age kids game as you get, fun beat the clock game with co-op game play.

RATING: 3
Clever cooperative game with beating a ticking clock as the collective goal.  Good board, great bits, but the game itself was too easy.  Would be better if the times could be set in increments of 1 minute, instead of 3 preset times.

I've played this game about 20 times, at least, with my kids.  When it was new and fresh, they loved it.  For me, the challenge is mostly gone, but I'll play it if my kids request it.  I can't imagine playing this with adults.

An okay co-op game, I can see it being a good gateway co-op for the kids, as to get them interested in this genre.

Nice cooperative family game. We enjoy the timer. But we actually haven't ever won yet. I blame it on my 4 yo boy, of course I would never tell him that.

You have have watched a lot of heist movies this game would be under "festive". No where close to being a good cooperative game. Children would be amused with the game as it feels really geared towards younger ages.

A likable game, but I wish it had a little more depth to it. Good for a quick spin if you don`t have time or access(games are too high on a closet shelf!)to a better game.

Good family game. I like the tension the timer can create and love that it's coop. Gets a bit repetitive after a lot of consecutive plays.

Great game for kids 8+ years old. It's guaranteed to be over in 30 minutes or less because of the timer. There's some drama in trying to unlock the safe in time. And it's fun trying to avoid the guard and the dog. This is at least an order of magnitude more fun that Mouse Trap. And... As of September 2005 you can get it for less than $10 on eBay.

Excellant co-op game, especially if you have kids.  Timer means the game will never drag too long, is very difficult with 4 players, too easy with 2.  We play that the police and dog capture you if they ever see you at any point in their movement.

There's something screwy about the way that the dog and guard can be sent back to their home spaces prematurely, but the real-time aspect of the game is toot-sweet.

Probably one of the better mass market games I have played, Enough tension in the game to make it enjoyable. Had some very close games, but then again becomes very easy once everyone knows the game . I will always play with people new to the game, makes it a blast that way.

Very coincidently I've had the exact same experience with this game as Tom Mackel (Logosync).  Pressured to play by a kid in college who said it was fun.  What a waste of 20-30min.  I hate being nice and playing crappy games.

RATING: 8
One play -- but we really enjoyed it. The 8 rating is as a kid's game. The working together means that we can help our 4 year-old play (it is rated 8  years) and he accepts the help and the game works well.

Well, it's now 8 plays and my 4 year-old still loves it. The tension builds wonderfully. My wife and I enjoy it with him greatly.

Now it is over 40 plays. Our grandson loves it and we play on every visit.

Love the timer, as it introduces a bit of tension throughout the entire game which ramps up the enjoyment. The guard and dog tokens introduce a bit of strategy into the fast-paced gameplay. Replay value is in trying to get your fastest time with a quick team of 4.

Co-op, dice rolling, 30 minutes, spy-themed? Sure, I'm in.... occasionally.

Tienes 30 minutos para entrar en el complejo, encontrar las llaves para abrir la caja y escapar. Las llaves están resguardadas por trampas. Debes evitar ser capturado por el guardia y su perro.

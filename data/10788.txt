Had high hopes for this one. Well basically Hellenes is worth at least a 7, but the fact that we spent 75% of the time arguing about the rules and searching the internet for clarifications is not a good thing. So the problem must be either the way the rules are written or that we are retards.

We played the 2 first scenarios and they both left a feeling that strategies were pretty much carved into stone.

While the combat comes from [thing=3685][/thing], the rest of the game does not and that is good, as I am getting kind of tired of playing the same game again and again.
  Tribute/Sacrifice, dual-use cards, sieges, and the special winter rules -- Kuddos to Craig Besinque for designing a fresh look at the block game.

 Juego muy interesante sobre la Guerra del Peloponeso. No se gana solo por ganar más batallas. También importa (y mucho!!) el cómo se ganan estas batallas, pues es el prestigio (y no el territorio) lo importante. Hay muchas variables que entran en juego.
 En el primer escenario (el único que he jugado hasta ahora) el ateniense debe prevenir las rebeliones que el espartano constantemente va a provocar en sus ciudades y desbaratar todas los intentos de lograr más ciudades. Las ciudades perdidas es necesario recuperarlas enseguida o la derrota puede ser inminente. Este primer escenario está ligeramente decantado hacia el espartano, aunque el ateniense sigue teniendo posibilidades de ganar. Para ello debe realizar pillajes bien calculados y defenderse con astucia. Debe de presentar batalla cuando y donde pueda pues los errores tácticos los paga mucho más caro que el espartano. De hecho el ateniense pierde más puntos por batallas y retiradas que por ciudades conquistadas.
 Juego muy bien elaborado y muy consistente. La niebla de guerra y los eventos/puntos de acción lo convierten en un juego muy divertido.

Overall, a good game that borrowed the main gameplay from Hammer of Scots. Hammer in Greece?

The maps, blocks and labels are top notch. They aid in set up but is really confusing for beginners to the game.

The game played very much like Hammer, except there are more events. This is both good and bad. Good as it drives the game to a certain historical aspect, flavourful. Bad, if only you could draw those cards and activate those events. 

The battle game system has add on chrome to that geographical area and time.

Plays quickly once all rules and cards are more familiar.

Craig Besinque has done some interesting things with the Columbia block system.  I liked the garrisons, less bothersome wintering and the more CDG-style use of cards.   

However, other innovations are less to my liking.  Both battles and siege assaults are high stakes affairs.  In part this is due to the rout mechanic.  Combat rating 2 units are common and have some effect on the enemy in 4/6 of dice rolls.  They rout an opposing unit, knocking it out of battle with 1/3 of their dice rolls.  As a result, armies can rapidly melt away.  This wouldn't matter very much if there were not so much prestige to be earned from triumphs in battles and sieges. Combine all of this with Sparta's dominance on land and Athens' dominance at sea (well represented in Hellenes) and the net result is a game of skirmishes at the margins - and the Athenians constantly racing around the Aegean putting down revolts.

The 431 scenario does seem to demand much more of the Athenian player by way of immediate grasp of strategy and, indeed, how the whole game works.  

The GMT production is to a reasonable standard. I like the board artwork, although it suffers from the usual block game problem of clutter at key points of the map.  The rules strike me as poorly structured and unclear on some important points.  Rarely have I spent so much time referring back to them and to clarifications in BGG forums.  The player aids are nicely done, though I would have rather had a season track on the board than on a piece of paper.

RATING: 9
There are lots of strategic possibilities, lots of tactical puzzles and responding to events, and I feel I could play the 431 scenario many more times before I would need to move on to one of the others. It's very thematic with the land power vs naval power asymmetry working out very nicely in the game. Definitely want to play it a lot more.

I would rate this a tentative 8, more to express how good I think the game should be than my actual experience. I only played the Sicily scenario once (which I can't particularly recommend except as an introduction to the game, as it isn't fully balanced - most events can't even be used).

A nice development of the usual Columbia block game. Several twists should make the game more interesting and less straightforward, and the prestige mechanic avoids the historical problem that Athens should probably win if it sits on its hands and does nothing.

Initial Impression: This game has some interesting mechanisms for a block war game. There's a constant tug-of-war over prestige points. It turns out that conquered cities generate prestige points every turn so it forces a nation to crush revolts as quickly as possible. The Battle and Siege mechanisms are simple, but the addition of routes generally preserves the armies so that conflicts can occur more frequently. Even the card play mechanisms are different from any other game that I've played. You both play your cards simultaneously with the lowest Ops card gaining the initiative. Also, all cards are reshuffled back into the deck at the end of each turn. 

The game feels very open-ended, with lots of different possibilities for strategy. The best part was that it really didn't feel all that scripted, although some of the events (plague) can be devastating if you can trigger them.

I really enjoyed Hellenes.  An innovative card mechanic with asymmetrical game play (Athens starts as a sea power with Sparta being the land power).   I've only played the 433 scenario which is playable in an evening.  I've played three times - two games were still tense in the final turn while one game was an early blowout.  Good fun.

In my limited experience, most games seem to follow a similar path with consequent impact upon replayability, so that prevents me from scoring it higher.

Am introducing my son (8 y.o.) to Ancient Greece. Got him a picture book and I am reading him Kagan's 'The Peloponnesian War' and will have him read 'The Odyssey'. We'll skip Euripides' 'The Trojan Women'. Puts one off war!

Lots of decisions to be made, different strategies. My son has picked up the rules very well. Dropped the rating a bit as did a lot of FAQ'ing and rule searching -always an issue with First Editions it seems though this site answers questions well and quickly! That said, what's not to like in something that lets you spend quality time with your son?

RATING: 5
Not a topic that has much appeal for me, but even if it did, I don't think this game would merit more than a 7, at best. The system plays easily enough, but I think there's a lack of variety in game play: turns are repetitive, many cards are very similar or identical, and there don't seem to be very many viable strategies for each side. It's not bad; but it's just not very good, either.

The block system has some aspects that seem rather odd to me; the combat system doesn't feel much like hoplite warfare, while the fog of war is too absolute (you can't even determine whether you're being besieged by a fleet or a land unit without sallying forth).

Played twice:

I'm a big fan of Rommel in the Desert (same designer)so I was eager to try Mr. Besinque's new Peloponnesian War game, Hellenes.

I really like the mechanics of the game (the rout/panic mechanic is brilliant).

There's also lots of flavor added by the attributes and abilities of various units (the cavalry's harrying attack for example).

Lots of different possibilities for strategy.

Looking forward to playing more.

There is a lot of great things going for Hellenes. I find the card play much more interesting then your typical Hammer of the Scots style block game. The addition of the gods is nice to help mitigate the luck factor. I have played two of the scenarios and there is quite a bit of variation in the style of play you need to utilize. So this is rapidly becoming one of my favorite block games. I enjoy it much more than Hammer of the Scots and Crusader Rex. Columbia Games really dropped the ball letting this game slip through their fingers!

Rating after a few plays. It's good. The overall flavor of the conflict is well preserved with the prestige concept, pillaging and siege warfare rules. The cards provide reasonably good historical flavor and accuracy.

I have a couple of relatively minor issues with the game. First, the blocks are just too dang big for the board. GMT should have used the smaller blocks (or a larger map). Second, the fog of war provided by blocks doesn't really fit with the time period, i.e. they did not get into battles without knowing the composition of the enemy forces. But, hey, it's a block game. Accept it or don't play, right?

[Edit: I'm tempted to play the blocks face up in stacks to provide limited intelligence to make it more realistic. So, you could still see which units are ships vs which are armies, but you could only see the top unit.]

On the whole, though, those are issues I can easily overlook given my overall enjoyment of the game. Thumbs up.

Just got my playtest copy, looks very nice indeed.

A very interesting game that imo captures both the political situation and the way the war was waged very well. It is a somewhat demanding game to play as you need to have a long term plan, and a flexible plan at that. Despite the shortish rules the game has an above average  learning curve. I fully expect fist time players sitting just staring at the map and wonder what on earth to do now?

Fortunately they have included an excellent example of play booklet to cover just that problem, well done.

Good replay value in the game as well. Many scenarios and since the two sides plays very differently swapping side should give you a whole new experience.

The rating is a bit cautious. I really like the game and could easily have given it a 9 rating, but I want to see how easy it is for newcomers to grasp before upping it.

I am pretty fond of the classical era and have read a few books about the Peloponnesian War, so this game already had a good chance to appeal to me. Luckily the gameplay was evocative and entertaining. It does a great job of presenting the conflict in a way that still effectively represents the challenges of the time without straightjacketing players into the particular outcomes seen in the war. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in a war game on the time period.

Rating might rise, and first impressions are very favorable.

I'm tempted to make lots of comparisons to Hammer of the Scots, but these are two fairly different beasts. This game has much more forgiving wintering, dynamic campaigns, and possibilities for large-scope events to sway the game. Much more in common with Hannibal as far as card-driven games go, and probably it will be one of the most successful in that regard as well.

Highly recommended game from a designer of few, but well-honed, epic games!

Playing this as the Spartans is a great intro to CDGs. The winter homing rule forces you to plan out carefully your yearly campaigns to achieve concrete objectives.

(Not so fun as Athens as you will be playing firefighter while looking for weak point in Spartan armor.)

Played a few games now. Interesting. This game very asymmetrical and it takes a while to tease out the strategies that work. It is a game where both sides have a couple of serious main strategic approaches. Athens must play down a good leader and tax card to get extra actions per card then leverage those actions to raid down the coast and duck out before the Spartan fist lands. Alternatively trying to overpower Thebes seems to be the way to go. Sparta, must either hunt the low hanging fruit of Athens more distant allies or steadily prepare an assault on Athens itself.

There is quite a bit of card play, which i don't really dig and is ultimately why i will trade it off, but the game has enough tactical variation and maneuver to make up for its slightly more limited strategic scope. 

=================

Good initial impressions. More rules than the lighter block games but they are familiar mechanisms to a seasoned wargamer. The game rewards an attritional approach with assaulting city walls or engaging in open battle being very risky enterprises. This does capture the feel of the war. There is enough chrome and game specific rules for Hellenes to feel like its own game rather than a re-skinning of the standard block game.

RATING: 8.5
Best game on the Peloponnesian War I have yet seen.  I have only played the 415 scenario and I am a bit concerned about how the game can develop some serious momentum issues. (If I had a good year in 414, and 413 changed nothing, then 413 was a good year too.  A couple of more years of nothing and my opponent is doomed.) But it does so much right!  The assault of even weakly defended fortified places is difficult and risky, but no more so than the historical records indicates.  The tempo is right.  Cardplay seems to provide the right tempo for treachery, revolts and civil disturbances, but to use them to maximum effect you have to intersperse them with Actions.  Combat also has a good tempo; armies seldom fight to the death, but a decision is reached when one side is forced to retire.  

The quibbles I do have are just that.  The game abstracts some aspects of the history I love to dote on. But, these abstractions are reasonable and responsible. And, the resulting game seems to work well because of them.

Το καλύτερό μου block game. 
Εύκολοι κανόνες, θεματικοί όσο δεν πάει, ασύμμετρες αλλά ισορροπημένες δυνάμεις, πολλοί δρόμοι για τη νίκη ή την καταστροφή, τέσσερα σενάρια τεράστιας επαναληπτικότητας, όμορφο ταμπλό και μονάδες. Οι παίκτες επικεντρώνονται στις επιχειρήσεις κι όχι στο ξεφύλλισμα κανόνων. Τα επιμέρους στοιχεία και μηχανισμοί μπορεί να είναι γνωστά από άλλα block games, αλλά εδώ δένουν απόλυτα με το θέμα και αφήνουν ελάχιστα θολά σημεία μετά από 2-3 παρτίδες.

Superb block game from GMT.  Top notch components and player aids. The rules are not complex, and after a couple of plays it was easy to not refer back to the rulebook at all. The longer scenarios can be easily finished in less than the advertised 4h, my second ftf game took only 2.5h to play until turn 10. 

The choices of strategy in the very assymetric positions of Sparta and Athens, as well as the pressure of responding to multimple threats with limited resources make it an absolute joy to play.

Makes Thucydides' text comprehensible, and very enjoyable reading at that. Hard to believe it's 2,300  years old. Echoes in today's world. $17 at Amazon.com and well worth it:

I'm on my second play through and as my first official Block game (Napoleon's Triumph is a unique beast!) I am really, really digging it. The scale and scope are just right for a light wargame. I find the game play to be pleasantly deep for such a simple rule-set. At 16 pages and filled with color, sidebar notes and decent referencing this is a wonderful model for light wargames rulebooks. I found the map to be very intuitive and beautifully illustrated.

Great game, but "watching grass grow" is actually quite close to the mark. Still, if you love ancient greece as I do, it's well worth it.

Clever game, promotes thoughtful play strategy by punishing ill planned operations. Losing a battle or losing a city won't just reduce your forces but will award the opponent "prestige" points, granting him a better chance to win the game.

Three plays. I really enjoyed the game; it has a nice amount of detail & flavor, but not so much that I felt like I was drowning in rules.

I still feel like I've only scratched the surface with this one.

The only problem is that the game has been going beyond the six-hour mark for us, and that's getting to be a bit of a deal-breaker.

My first block game. I've only played the 831 scenario a few times and I enjoyed it. I also very much appreciate its asymmetry and how well it simulates the prolonged, stuttering progress of the conflict but I'm still not sure how well this will translate to entertainment on repeat plays, particularly after exposure to more streamlined and accessable block games. The rules seem clean but playing revealed they're not as clear as they first appear; the Spartan pillage Athens and incite revolt / Athenian damage control strategies may prove to be scripted and unchanging; and there is a suspicion that it may be unbalanced in favour of Sparta, which is an issue in a relatively long game. I'm looking forward to trying the 813 scenario and I rate it because of my interest in the war and how well it simulates it, but it's a slow burner that's already been pushed back in the queue by quicker, more exciting games, and may not see as much table time as I'd originally hoped.

Have playtested this for Craig. This one has a fairly steep learning curve; the first couple of games I had an overall "what the heck do I do now?" sort of feeling. However, after I'd made a couple of bone-crushing mistakes, I learned what works and what doesn't. Sparta is supreme on land and Athens is master of the seas -- neither power can come to grips with the other on their own turf successfully. Thus lateral thinking and indirect action rule the day. It is easier (and more efficient) to inflict "death by a thousand cuts" upon your opponent rather than striving for a knock-out blow. There will be no battles like Salamis or Leuctra during the Peloponnesian Wars, just as it should be. Card action is a nice balance between action and events -- the events are cool, but come at the expense of lost opportunities. I'll write more as my understanding grows.

The game that Craig Besinque took to GMT from Columbia manages to be better than its hastily conceived rival, Athens and Sparta, but problems remain. Like most of GMT's output, over-complex rules surround a fundamentally simple core, there's luck in which cards you draw and some high-stakes die rolls. The 'sacrifices to the gods' mechanism allows you to mitigate the luck to some extent, but you can't mitigate everything. The short Sicily scenario is unwinnable for Athens, some would say that's realistic, I say that's not much of a game. Drawing cards from a single deck and using that as the driving mechanism never creates the best wargames, but I'll play this one more time at least.

A solid block game. I like how the designer chose to concentrate on 4 campaigns instead of playing the entire war. Like many block games, it's a dice-chucker. I definitely have issues with the game though. There were too many times I had questions that the rule book just couldn't answer.

This is an excellent CDG block wargame for this period.  Players can vary their strategies for each scenario.  The more you play; the more planning you'd have to do to anticipate your opponent.  Battles are bloody; in addition to hit rolls; depending on their status, they can also rout opponents.  The scenarios are well balanced with the exception of the Sicily scenario wherein the burden is on the Athenians to attack.  I've heard comments that Athens can't win the 431 BC scenario.  For the record, after playing 4 times, I've seen Athens can win this scenario twice; it requires careful planning and strategy.  Perhaps, one day, the game designers can give hints and sample plays.

RATING: 7.5
Good block game from GMT.  Different CDG style from other GMT classics (not heavily event driven).  Game tends to center around control of your vassal city states away from Sparta and Athens.  Athens tend to have more freedom of movement with the superior Navy.  Spartans can keep them busy with revolts and hard to stop Spartans from pillaging around Athens.

The chrome Hellenes adds to the lighter Columbia games using the ABC-block system works wonders. The battles are quick and deadly and the routing rule further emphasizes the differences of troops. Loads of tension, chances to reduce luck by careful planning, though there still is considerable randomness in what cards get dealt, the couple first years of a game can be crucial. The upside there is that games end quicky, though perhaps rather anticlimactic, if they start really going downhill for one side. I need more plays under my belt to see if it really is as good. I anticipate the other scenarios to be better balanced than 431.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game sits at a very nice point half-way between the simple card-activation system of Columbia block games, such as Richard III and Julius Caesar, and the far more event-laden systems of card-driven-games like For the People and Twilight Struggle.  If you like block games, but want more historical content and feel, this is the game for you.  Alternatively, if you like CDGs, but want less complex hand management decisions, this is the game for you.  There are very few games out there with this balance of historicity and playability.  I wish there were more.

The most anticipated block game to me, and the only.  Released after 2 years since 2007.  The publication was changed hand from Columbia Games to GMT.  The map graphics is upgraded nicely.  After disappointment with the release of Epic of the Peloponessian War by Clash of Arms and a lame "mock" game of Athens vs Sparta (I mean fitting the Peloponessian War into the same framework of Napoleon and WW2 block game system from Columbia Games, this game hopefully can salvage my interest back from this ancient epic campaign.  Read the excellent article by Joel Toppen (game developer of this game and Washington's War) on the war - "A Brief History of a Protracted Tragedy" in C3i issue 23. It gave you a short and concise to the stages of war and significant battles and leaders on stage.  Don't miss it. 

I played the BC431 scenario with John...and a hell of a good game! It recollects me memory of playing Peloponnesian War solitaire and the reading of Xenophon's masterpiece. The game is subtle in the beginning but as it goes on, wow, you feel right at home inside the city states and the decisions to make are genuinely portrayed without too much chromes inhibiting on the road. It is very important on how do you plan the campaign in the beginning for what it takes to accomplish a victory to either Athens or Spartan. A very enjoyable experience and a great game to play! Plus, I like the constant shuffling of the cards each turn!

I P500 this one by accident so got the game even if I had no intention of buying it! At first glance, I don't see much use for the "hidden" wood block system, but I love blocks, so no biggie there; and I suspect it works better in solitaire than advertised. It seems that with the hidden block system you cannot tell if an enemy unit is a ship or a hoplite! The "simple" rules mean it will definitely get tried soon. But I would be very surprised if it beats my beloved VG "The Peloponnesian War".  :-)

Rated after 2 plays: This is an OK game. But despite the large maps counters seem to end up all bunched into the same areas in the south, or perhaps I am playing it wrong, but right now not enough space for the blocks on the chokepoints on the map. The card events are nice. Still, I do not seem to get the feeling for the historical period. I do like the combat rules. TPW will stay my preferred game on the subject for now. The "hidden" system seems superfluous.

But I will definitely play it again soon!  :-)

I played the -431BC scenario with a veteran wargamer this week-end.
Although he was very reluctant to play block games he was totally convinced by Hellenes (I was already)

What we liked most:
- the tactical combat system. Even if it is not new, we found it very adapted to the antic period. It was surprising in a strategic system.
- the map which is looks really beautiful once blocks are placed.It is also very well designed in terms of distances between strategic cities or sea movement
- the force pool which is really well thought
- a lot of very small simple rules that add chrome without complexity: recruiting process, barbarians vs greeks, siege process, skirmishing and retreat process, boats on land, revolts and events, leaders

Played also Sicilian and -413 Campaign.
Luck factor may play big on certain events like crossing open seas or not receiving some important cards. At least my opponent suffered a lot from bad cards.

Not too sure about the Sicily scenario, but we'll call it a learning experience.  Plays quite differently than my other block games.  Played the 413 scenario halfway through, but also did not grab us.  Was not happy how easy it was for Sparta to gain prestige and so difficult it was for Athens: it seem Athens has to be the aggressor.  Maybe this is historical, but I always thought Sparta was more offensively minded.

Have just read the designer's suggestions, and have some ideas how to help Athens...

Tight and longish hardcore wargame where asymmetric Sparta and Athens fight eachother in 400 BC. The gameplay captures the feeling of the era prtty well.

Tutorial could also be more specific on starting positions of the blocks to help introducing the game to new players. My first "block" type wargame.

A classic design IMHO. Very nicely built game, with two distinct player strategies - Athens a sea power, and Sparta a land power. Each player has several options to consider when building its strategy, both players can follow a very aggressive play, but based on different strengths. The cards give a sufficient twist, and the sacrifice to the gods mechanics is really a nice idea that fits so well in this game. Each game is different.One day will write a review of it..

The playtest pictures look like that this publication suffers from a completely overcrowded "main battlefield" in south and central Greece - as already seen in other games with this topic. Please, can someone design a version with two different map scales? And could this not be historically justified - if not with numbers involved (yes, the Sicily expedition was big) then at least with C3I because forces (and Allies) around Sparta and Athens could be better controlled by the political parties in the capitals, justifying a more "micro"-look at the military events there.

I was aware of fallout between "Hellenes" designer Craig Besinque and Columbia Games prior to him taking his design to GMT, followed by the issuance by Columbia of its own version of same, "Athens & Sparta." 

I own the latter, which I think has its own strengths, despite shortcomings others have pointed out, but I also own Besinque's "Rommel in the Desert" and "WestFront" and am very impressed with his designs. 

Also, I have read interviews with him, and through those have gotten a very positive impression of him as a person, so I wanted to get a copy of "Hellenes" before it's too late to find one available. So, I purchased a used copy in August 2012.

This game is amazing.  I love the "routing" mechanic since it makes every die roll more exciting and speeds the battle resolution.  There are so many small rules that add chrome without huge amounts of complexity.  Athens and Sparta play very differently, they really need to pursue different strategies.  After 2 plays of the 731 campaign I look forward to trying the other scenarios.  They playtime can be a problem, and each year can start to feel similar.  As stated elsewhere this is a game of attrition and momentum - remember that you are simulating 10 years of combat.  Even if you only expand to one new city each year, those points get scored at the end of each year so the momentum will start to shift your way if you can hold them.  My wife and I play one or two years at a time and just leave the game set up over a span of a week.  This works really well for us.

Very solid block war game, may well be one of the best ever made. The rules are mostly clear, although the layout of the book makes finding and understanding the flow of the rules somewhat confusing. The game is very open ended with how you go about achieving victory, with some historical influences. Card play is interesting and can somewhat drive the direction players take to victory.

My only reason for not rating it higher is the length of the game can be a bit long, although with a few more plays perhaps that will improve.

Do not expect "Another block game". There is a well designed system inside this one. Cards are the heart of it all. The flavour of the ancients is perfectly pictured as well and if you love this age you are gonna enjoy this one specially. Sicily is a good introductory scenario since Peace of Nicias is in effect, so no revolts are allowed, "just" move and fight. The rest of campaigns denotes different struggle through years between two of the most powerful city-states of history, Sparta against Athens, military strength against one of the finest culture city ever. This is a perfectly balanced game. Great designer work! Tension, pillaging, battles, sieges, attrition, sea storms, leadership, barbarians... Just enjoy it

RATING: 7
A nicely designed game with some simple but effective rules (garrison blocks, routs) improve it over similar block games such as Crusader Rex. I think it is reasonably historical if played sensibly. Whether that is a good thing for a war that ran more than 20 years without a lot happening is up to you to decide. Much hinges on seemingly minor actions for small towns such as Amphipolis, while the Spartans will pillage Athens every year, but can not really mount an effective assault. The two sides are very different to play. Enjoyable to play, but not as varied or gripping as say Hannibal, or the designer's Rommel block game.

Long, strategic game that rewards patience and opportunism. Has a strong historical feel without a huge amount of rules overhead. The choices feel right.

Feels a lot like Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage in scope, complexity, and tension.

RATING: 5
This alternative to Athens & Sparta has some positives the other game does not--more scenarios, for one--and is more of an operational feel, with yearly turns. 

I enjoy the differentiated sea and land combat ratings for ships, force march, victory coming with prestige, and the inherent garrisons. But, as others have pointed out, the events are predictable and few in variety, straitjacketing the game along historical occurrences. For, instance, wasn't a plague possible in another city besides Athens? A revolt in a Spartan ally? Whereas A&S is more "spirit of the age," this game is more exactly "as it happened." 

Also strange that you can choose your own types of luck via sacrificing to various gods. Maybe this represents "training" your troops in siege, force march, etc. somehow?

No terrain on the rather grim-looking map? 

The Sicily scenario's pretty cool and the mundane nature of the earlier war is covered too, with Athens running around quelling revolts while other parties fiddle around the edges and the Spartan behemoth looms, but it's not as large as it appears to be... 

Tried the Argive War scenario. I have no idea of its verisimilitude, but it was a fun little exercise in combat.

This is my first block game and even though its made by GMT the blocks have that known Columbia block style (Hammer of the Scots for instance).  I do like the variation on the typical block card mechanics .  The cards are more powerful then a traditional Columbia style block game, which gives it a block / CDG feel.  The blocks and reinforcement mechanics also provide good fog of war and the variable card initiative provides an added unknown which will lead to good replay value.  I also find the initial sacrifice action to be rather clever.

There is a lot to this game, and the gameplay takes a while to get used to.  The paths to victory don't always jump out at you.  Siege combat for instance can be brutal and the 2 sides have unique strengths and weaknesses you must adapt to in order to be successful.

After a few playthroughs, I'm starting to get a deeper level of appreciation of the tension and strategic subtleties involved in this game. Have only tried the 431 BCE scenario, but so far it seems that Athens requires both brilliant play and a solid chunk of luck to be competitive. I'm hoping the 413/415 BCE scenarios are more balanced.
-----
There's a lot going on with this one -- not your typical block game. Balancing the chance of prestige loss versus the opportunity to win a siege. Distributing forces to garrison cities but not weaken the center. Planning the campaign year before having to home the armies over winter. Gives an excellent historical sense of the Peloponnesian war. 

The map is just serviceable -- a bit bland and doesn't quite grab my attention. The gameplay might be hampered by the historical accuracy -- the Peloponnesian war was very attritional and it's a bit of a slog here as well.

I'm kind of on the fence with this one.  I bought it because the combat sounded so very cool, with the different agility classes and damage ratings - so that your archer has a chance of knocking a step out of the Spartan elite hoplites - but in my one face-to-face play so far, major combat seemed like it was usually a bad idea.  The Athenian sits tight behind his walls and makes the occasional raid when he's not busy putting down revolts.  Just not as interesting as I'd hoped.

Now maybe the problem is that I haven't learned how to play well yet.  That's certainly a possibility.  We'll see, but I feel like this might go in the trade pile.

4/12 Traded away.  It just wasn't quite what it might have been.

two plays of the first scenario. Asymmetrical forces and strategies make this a very interesting block game.

Un par de turnos jugados. Es más ágil de lo que pensaba.

Ojo, el tablero no es duro, es de cartón blando (obligado jugar con plexiglas).

A great block wargame.  If you are a fan of the history this game is amazing!

A mix of block game, Columbia style and card driven wargame. It works well, with a very asymmetrical play.

Well, I love block games, I love card driven games and I find this to be one of the most interesting periods of history.  So is it any surprise that I'm really taken with this game?  It helps that it is very well designed, gives players the opportunity for creative play, and has mechanics that feel very appropriate for the conflict at hand.  Probably my #2 wargame now behind Twilight Struggle.

Making a game about a conflict as complicated as the Peloponnesian War is a daunting task and the fact that this game is fun and playable is a great testament to the skill of its designer.  While there are flaws, it is hard for me to think of too many ways to improve upon it without greatly increasing the complexity of the game to the point where the fun factor would be diminished.

Just finished playing. Great game. Very deep and well crafted. The rules feel logic and natural. My only concern is that maybe the game is a little scenario-driven and when all the scenarios have been played once or twice with both factions the game's over. Now that I think about it even if that's true it's still long enough to be worth buying!

Played a playtest copy, and enjoyed the game.  But as it stands now,
it may change a lot before it is published, the game lacks much flavor
of the time it protrays.  It seems to be a variation of Hammer of the
Scotts or Crusader Rex without much of a background.  As such why would
I want this game instead of the other two I mentioned?

Interesting block game with plenty of excitement and harsh tactical decisions once the slaughter starts, with the added bonus of making a decent attempt at being historically accurate. While there are certainly better games for that era, it deserves at least a couple of plays

This is a great hybrid of CDG and block game.  It includes several scenarios which allow you to play the Spartan-Athenian wars.  Events are what drive the revolts and plagues which historically caused Athens so much trouble in this era.  One of the neat things about this war and game is how different the two sides are - Athens the dominant seapower but with some unique vulnerabilities, Sparta the ruler on land but unable initially to force its will on Athens because of those damn fleets.  Hidden forces of course, one of the benefits of using blocks.  Although I'm not really very good at it, highly recommended.

RATING: 7
Rating based on two plays of the 413 scenario.

Both games had very few field battles.  Since we came to appreciate the tremendous defensive benefits of siege warfare, it was all sieges all the time.  We also learned to fear the rout, as I saw two Corcyra units + a garrison nearly rout my entire storming 8-block Spartan army - in a single combat round!  So much for Pylos being an easy grab.

Sparta was a hoot to play, and I was able to wreak more havoc with Spartan fleets than I had originally thought possible.  And never underestimate the power of the Pillage.  I do wonder whether Barbarians are little more than Pillage factories, though, especially in the late game.

When it was my turn as Athens, three revolts popped up in high-VP cities on the outskirts of the Athenian empire early in the game, and that was all she wrote.  And that was with the half-Tribute rule in effect. I'm not a player who reaches for strategy guides after the first beating, so I look forward to figuring out how to play Athens properly on my own time.

I like a game where I have fun, but I still have no idea what to do after a few plays. For me, that describes Hellenes to a T.

In the last few years I've been shying away from block war games. I feel that with their 'base 4' combat units the hidden intelligence aspects of the game don't add much anymore. Plus, they don't fit all historical periods. 

But this game is a keeper for me, mainly because it is the only 'playable' game out there on the Peloponnesian War. The 'Clash of Arms' games is a beautiful train wreck, and the 'Columbia', "Athens and Sparta" is a generic system adapted to the war. This one has a higher learning curve than most block games but is a pretty good simulation of a rather complex war. 

Very nice map and counters, but it suffers the same problem that nobody has yet fixed, which is "counter clutter".

A fine representation of the Peloponnesian war, and great fun! Be warned, there is a steep learning curve so it would pay to read some strategy articles first.

Interesting game about intra-Greek warfare. You score points by winning battles, conquering cities and pillaging enemy countryside. Battles are intuitive, with light units attacking first but carrying lighter punch and heavy infantry attacking second but doing a lot more damage.

El escenario sencillo es simple y entretenido.
Muy superior al Athens & Sparta que estaba mal acabado y diseñado.
Me esperaba un poco más de este, pero está bien. En la línea de Crusader Rex, aunque un juego más inteligente.

Rating after initial play as the Spartans. There's a lot of subtlety of play yet to be uncovered as we were going through the rules. It definitely seems to evoke the period pretty well.

Update: Just picked up a copy of Strassler's "The Landmark Thucydides" to learn more about the period.

8/14/13 - Rating 7:  Undeniably clever where straightforward warfare is generally unadvisable and, indeed, sometimes difficult to even get into.  But, as much as I don't want this to be true, the game just isn't that exciting.  The indirect warfare seems to diffuse the game's action and it's been hard to it to gain much momentum.  There is a very real chance that there is more to this game that I've yet to discover, but, after 4 games, I was hoping for more than I've gotten.  I haven't given up on it yet though--it's just full of so many good ideas.

11/19/09 – 3 plays of the 431 scenario so far, plus a learning game of the Sicily game.  431 is a much better learning scenario than Sicily—don't be lured in by the promise of Sicily's shorter playing time.

Hellenes reinvents the dreary Hammer of the Scots system in ways that tickle me pink.  Individual battles have much larger stakes than this game's predecessors, both in terms of tension and importance.  Card play is dramatically improved by adding events to every card.  Winter rules are handled marvelously, where planning for winter no longer consumes summer-time actions.  Asymmetrical factions means each side must invest in different strategies that utilize its strengths and both sides have multiple strategic options.  Definitely a top-tier game.  A block game of this caliber has not been seen since Eastfront, and it's about fre*kin' time it's showed up.

RATING: 9
Amazing block game, with a totally different feel of playing than Craig Besinque's jewel Eastfront (what might explain the somewhat low ratings, in my opinion) its less action than EF, but amazingly historically adequate and I just love the theme of the Peloponnesian War. A few more events would have been nice, but it plays fun with its limited-goals-strategy and its asymetry.

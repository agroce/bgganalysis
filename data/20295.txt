Like air hockey but with magnets to control your players. You can't kick too hard or you will lose control of your player, so a soft touch adds something to this dexterity-skill game.

Gorgeous game with incredible production values.  Like most dexterity games, coordination is a must, and long fingernails are a definite problem (as they tend to scrape against the bottom of the board).  The original version is too big and expensive for the amount of play it would see.  A junior version would be awesome!

Despite my rating, this is a good example of a game which rates a 10 when you're in the right mood and have a willing and equally (in)competent opponent - great fun.

RATING: 6
This one looked a lot more fun than it really is, but the idea is great!  The best part for me is when one player loses a player from his magnet, which his opponent can then attach to his own player as a giant phallus.  You'd have to play to know what I'm talking about.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun! I feel like you don't really have a lot of control though.

The best part is sort of when one of your dudes falls over, hits another dude, and becomes some kind of weird mutant. Need to make alt rules for using mutant soccer players.

RATING: 7
A great party game, which requires at least four players, but is best with six.
Magnets are not strong enough to hold the figures on the board when one does abrupt moves, but I find this adds to the game, as you rush to get your "player" back on it's magnet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fast-paced, goofy dexterity game that reminds me most of air hockey. Each player has two pucks that they move around via magnets under the board. You can't see what your hands are doing, making it an odd experience. It's a bit too easy to lose control and fling your guys across the field though. 

It's quite well constructed. I especially liked the foam padding on the center wall for when you inevitably bash your fists into it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great dexterity game. If you are a fan of dexterity games in general, this is a great choice. It plays 2, (up to 4 if each person controls one player). I would compare it to a close up on a Foosball game, focusing on just 4 players.

Weykick (the basic soccer version) is great 
great fun for 2 to 6 players. And you get 
people into play who say "no" to almost all 
other games. 
 
Several players gave me their congratulations:
"This is the best game you designed". They
were very surprised to hear that I am "only"
an owner of Weykick but in no way involved in 
its design.

Watching other people is great fun, too.  We
had already situations with 6 players and 10
"observers" who all were active in one way or
the other. When you visit the fair in Essen, 
don't miss the "box" of Ulrich Weyel and his Weykick.

RATING: 8
A superb alternative to Foosball or airhockey.  Made of all wood, I purchased the recent Weykick on Ice (Icehockey version).  Though it comes in many sizes, the smallest version is very managable for any home.  The magnetic mechanism is very clever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A combo of Air Hockey and Rod-Hockey I think which are both games I enjoy. Fun but I still prefer many other dex games, and think that the 'combo' doesn't really surpass either. 

However playing with more than 2 players on a bigger board would likely be more fun for sure and rate higher like 8! (similar to playing one of those Rod-Hockey arcade games)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Almost as good as Crokinole as a dexterity game
Magnets under the table control the pieces, and you use them to
shoot the "ball" into the other's goal.

How can you not like this game? It's just fun and accessible, yet has some depth to it: controlling the two players to make feints and passes to each other is really not easy! Curving the ball by applying spin is also possible!

RATING: 8
I've wanted to play WeyKick for years and after finally getting my own copy I have to say that it lives up to my high expectations. It's pretty much exactly as I expected. It's playable by both adults and kids and is almost guaranteed to be a lot of fun for anyone to play. The only downside is that once it's assembled it takes up quite a bit of space and is a hassle to store.

What's not to love?  You play soccer with magnetic men.  Reflexs are the name of the game.  I probably will rarely log plays because it is so quick and fun.  You hardly noticed you played it and you've played it 10 times.

I dont understand the comments about magnetic pawns flying off. It's clear that if they fly off the table you putted too much strength shooting the ball. I'm more worried about the 45° corners on the 4 players version (which I own): they force to use a pawn as a goalkeeper becaus when the balls bounce on the corners it can easily become a (very angled) goal. ahh its nice but too expensive (and for what you pay I expected a foldable version )

Played at Essen 2008. This is a very fun dexterity game. The game is pretty expensive. On the otherhand for what you get this is reasonably priced.

I played the new release J7200 with some funny players and targeted to kids. It is on my buylist for next years Essen.

Who am i kidding. I ordered the 7500 model with green field and 4 janosch figures and upgraded balls.
If I am happy with the delivery I might order two mini versions as well.


update  very happy.

Might get me some icehockeyplayers . No need for them now.

edit:
After a discussion with geekbuddies I upped my rating to a 9. I love my boardgames. So it's kind of strange to rate it higher than almost every game I own but it is just so much fun. I can't imagine myself without a weykick table around.

Middling fair dexterity game. I'd play it now and again. There's an art, or a trick, to moving the paddles without severing the magnetic connection that makes it  not just a fast twitch reaction game. I don't need to own this or play it often, but I welcome a game or two every year at conventions when it is available.

An arbitrary dexterity game that looks more compelling than it plays.  Basically this is Air-hockey, only without the speed of play.  Imagine a game of air hockey where your opponent's striker constantly slips out of his hands, flies across the court and sticks to your striker....   That is Weykick.  Fun as a novelty and I can only really imagine owning it if I collected table dexterity games.

Nice idea, but the joy is fleeting. It's annoying when your dudes fly off, although when you absorb them to create a mutant Wilfred Brimley Thing creature it's pretty awesome.  I keep expecting the dog flower head to pop out.  

Anyway, It's kind of fun for a little while, but I just can't see playing this all the time.  The game is enjoyable for about 5 minutes.  It's pretty bulky and just isn't worth the cost or the space.  I should also point out that I'm remarkably bad at this.  My feeling is that it just isn't as good as Tipp-Kick which scratches the same itch.

Oh, this is a lot of fun. It's really not a boardgame. It's a toy, but since I played it at Essen and it appears on here, I'm logging and rating it accordingly. :)

A dexterity toy where you're playing football using magnets under the table to control your players. I played a 2 player game where we each controlled 2 footballers and a 4 player game where we had 3 per team.

It really is hugely fun - we'd only intended to play for a minute or two and ended up playing two full games. I'd actually say this is more fun than Crokinole, but the small board was 129E which is staggeringly expensive. I'd never buy it, but would be happy if someone else did...

Home-made version. Board looks like a hockey rink, but I made pieces to support both soccer and ice hockey play. Young kids will find it easier to play soccer, but the ice hockey takes more skill.

WeyKick was probably my favorite new dexterity game that I tried at BGG.CON (possibly tied with Piratenbillard). It’s like hockey or soccer where you’re trying to knock a marble into your opponent’s goal by moving your figures around the board. The catch is that you have to control your figures by manipulating strong magnets on the underside of the board. This makes precision a lofty goal indeed. It’s particularly amusing when your figures get disconnected from the magnets and go flying across the board, so you have to decide whether to waste a hand trying to recover the renegade figure or to play with a man-down to avoid getting scored on. It was a lot of fun and very easy to pick up and play.

Unfortunately I had to sell of this game. I liked it but the kids fought a lot over the games. It's fiddly and doesn't stay still on the table or floor. Thus a lot of plays are affected accidently, and not so accidently by moving the game while shooting. Its difficult for excited kids to calm down enough to  keep the game from jumping around and I found this leads to a lot of arguments over cheating. Eventually, my wife banned this because it was disruptive.

Have played it several times and can only recommend the game. It's a fun and fast paced dextery game. You control the pawns (with magnets) below the board and so only see them move around on the board trying to score goals. Really great game to introduce new players or to get the attention of bystanders.
Only problem is that sometimes the magnets aren't strong enough if you move too fast (but that's your problem while in a game :) ). Other drawback is that you need some replacement pawns sooner or later but Ulrich Weyel sells them seperately.

RATING: N/A
The one CCG I got into in the nineties, now super-cheap to get a pile of cards for since they over-estimated demand and apparently printed far too many!

Similar to Magic in some ways, but with some nice expansions of the game in different directions; not really a duelling-warriors game, and playable with more than two players!

RATING: 6
The CCG that I own the most cards for. It´s still a reasonable amount (I think approx. 250) but considering I don´t like deckbuilding already a bit to much. The art is ugly in a strangely attractive way. Basic gameplay is solid, but beeing a CCG there are ofcourse some very annoying/strong cards. This stuff was extremely cheep for some time, so if your favourite store still has some arround just buy some starters and boosters.

RATING: 7
The myriad of keywords camouflage the overall simplicity of the game.  Deckbuilding is more important that in-game tactics.  Perfect for drafting.

I love thinking about the theme of this setting.  Imagine if the universes of Harry Potter, Men In Black and the X-Files were all together on one island, alongside Bond villains, mad scientists, time travelers, and the tourists drawn to that sort of thing.

Surreal, clever setting and surprisingly clean design.  No deckbuilding limits, nearly structureless play.  Some art is so bad it's terribly endearing.  Clearly influenced by Modern Naval Battles, clearly influential on constructive win condition and progressive storyline in later CCGs.  Only for multiplayer.  I'm a Control addict, at least that's what the Gladsteins want me to think.

I'm not a fan of CCGs in general, but this is a good one. Rich theme, sound mechanics, quirky artwork, and an overall quality of weirdness put this one over the edge. It seems this one has been all but forgotten, which is too bad really because it's a good game.

Strange game of Surreal Conspiracies.  I love it.  This is the CCG that sucked me in, even more so than Magic.  It's a little abstract in that how you place character cards on the table determines who protects whom (forming an abstract power structure).  If you like strangeness in your games, play this one.  Just watch out for the Patrol Baboons.

My favorite ccg ( well, tied with LOTR ccg ). Cool, quirky, twisted and unique setting. I love how certain characters evolve with new sets. Everything just works so smoothly. The rules are simple and elegant, and the game mechanics allow for even someone who's very far behind to catch up and eventually win. The major problem was extremely poor card distribution, but that is easily rectified by purchasing several boxes of each set ( they go for super-cheap, and I mean SUPER-cheap ). The game cannot be played with two players, however - it's a multi-player game that I've found is best with 4, and works well with 3 or 5.

RATING: 7
Great multiplayer CCG, when there aren't many out there.  Each person is a strange faction (like Illuminati) of shadowy conspiracies vying for control of the fictional island the game is set on.  Intelligent baboons, disintegrator rays, aliens, the CIA, the military, street gangs, artists, mutants.  Goal is to gain an amount of influence rather than kill the other player(s) makes for good mechanics.  If you like CCGs, these cards can be found fairly cheap and putting decks together yourself and handing them to friends can make it play like a non-CCG.  One of my "hidden gems."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My favorite card game, even though I no longer have co-conspirators.  I am one of those that likes the variety of artwork and the bizarre setting.  I sold off most of what I had, and then bought it all again.  Very affordable these days, but slowly growing more scarce.  One day I will have the sample cards...

Current Rating based on 2 two player games and is likely to go up once we learn more about the card interactions in this game.  This is simpler than Magic, Doomtown, and Jyhad and easier to teach.  I like the idea of the "conspiracy" you build with your characters and see the potential for a satisfying game.  I'm anxious to try it with three.

Horribly ugly art and sometimes completely random and illogical card content on an otherwise original game. Not worth getting into now-a-days. If you're looking for a classic CCG to buy back stock for, there are a myriad of other recommendations I'd give you to try before laying a finger on this early attempt to take down the Magic juggernaut.

RATING: 8
I got my first cards from a friend. That nearly ruined me. I spent lots on buying new cards, and then lost almost half of them when I separated from the girl I lived with at the time.

Still I tink this is the best CCG I have tried. It is out of print, and that is a pity.

This game has created a perfect world where nothing seems unrealistic. A great game about even greater conspiracies.

Played 40+ times. My favourite CCG alongside `Mythos´. Haven´t played `Over the Edge´ (or any other RPG), but I like the setting. Even a very simple deck has a chance in this one, and 3-player is very different from 2-player. And it´s much cheaper than most other CCGs these days :-)

Nephew/Tweet. 2-5.

RATING: 5
This game never seemed to take off, however, it was definately a neat idea for a CCG.  One major flaw, it was collectible.  I think this game might have worked well as a stand alone NON-collectable game.  The only differences could be released through a handful of expansions to cover all the needed components of the CCG.  But, gang wars type card games definately held my attention...long enough to try it out anyways.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My favorite CCG.  Art ranged from decent to terrible, but how could you not love a game with cards like &quot;pythagorean convulsion&quot; (all characters use their collector number rather than strength for the turn) or &quot;copyright violation&quot; (play to bring in a card from another game - my favorite use was an X-Wing)?

I LOVE this game. Faster, easier, weirder and more fun than MagicCCG. None of the cards are as complicated as some of the MagicCCG cards either.

RATING: 5
Had a lot of fun with this years ago; stood out among other CCGs with its bizarre theme and backstory.  Expansions actually added a lot to the game, especially the "Cut-Ups" set, which added a surrealist touch to the game, including twisted alternate victory conditions (such as having six cards in a row that spelled out a word.)  Still, as a game, not much to write home about.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a Magic: the Gathering clone, i.e. play resource-generating cards to power other cards which in turn attack opponents.  I dislike Magic and its mechanics in general so I should hate all clones, but the theme of this game makes it worth trying.

Still, from my limited play experience: it's just Magic with card position restrictions.  On the Edge, like many CCGs, has a large number of useless common cards and most of the best are rare leading to unsatisfying games when one player has access to more cards. 

EDIT: 31 Oct 2015.  OK, after four games of On The Edge I've really warmed up to this game; I'm bumping the score from 6.5 to 8.  It would be a 9 but I can't in good faith give a 9 to a game that includes such poor art (amongst some rare good art).

On the Edge still suffers from the "only Rare cards are good cards" syndrome of lesser CCGs.  If you can get past that, and IF you can find at least two opponents, it's a very, very fun game.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game with wonderful theme but where the gameplay didn't grab me, having to create ranks which supported each other and fight thru your opponent's ranks similarly. Just didn't seem dynamic enough.

A great fun CCG from the early days of the Big CCG Craze. Som people hate the art, but I find it entertaining (except the "Secret"-cards which are just plain horrible.) Works very well (best) in multiplayer mode.

(3 plays)  A wasteland CCG that is in some ways too derivative, and in other ways too obtuse.  I think if you know and play a lot of CCG games, this could be good - but I don't - so it was like, why not just play Magic?  At least I already know that one...

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Uniquely flavorful game with some different mechanics, though I have yet to ever play a game.

Update: played just once so far. Not sure my decks were very good. We both had a dry spell of getting pullers out, which seems uninteresting. The game got much better once we both had a variety of characters out and were generating influence. Want to play more, and also try it multiplayer.

RATING: 7
A dead CCG, so you can pick up all the cards printed very inexpensively. Which is good, 'cause this is a pretty fun game! 

Some similarities to [gameid=463]: 
- tap cards to generate currency (mana) which you use to play other cards
- cards can be attached to other cards
- different cards generate different subtypes of currency

Differences from Magic:
- theme: you are not planeswalkers, but conspirators trying to take control; the cards and terms do a good job conveying the theme
- terminology: tap -> crank, enchantment -> gear or condition, mana -> pull, land -> resources, color -> types
- gameplay:
  x cards are played in a rank/file grid, and position IS important
  x larger starting hand size and ability to discard duplicate cards -> you should see more of the cards in your deck
  x instead of just 5 colors, this uses MANY keywords; cards can have different combinations of keywords, so you should be able to make a much greater variety of "color" (keyword) combination decks
  x goal isn't to kill the other player, but to exert enough (different target for different # players) pull during the game
- you don't have to deal with a gazillion cards and FAQs and rule clarifications!

Yikes, there's some terrible artwork here. That's really an understatement; it's right on the edge (ha!) of inducing nausea. Thankfully, that's the least important CCG criteria I have, but this is really distractingly bad, even in terms of just graphic design and not the wretched pictures themselves.

The game has too many specific-type interactions to make it work as a deal-n-play game, which is a deal breaker for me.  Not a flaw, of course, but with CCGs I like the feeling of making something out of a mess of nothing, and here you just can't do that too often.  Deckbuilding required.

RATING: 10
Firstly I should say, that not a lot of people will like it and it has some flaws, but I think it still deserves higher appretiation. I'm not sure, but I think such mechanics as in this game don't exist in any other boardgame. It is built around the idea of not knowing, how to play this game this current round, you only get 1/4 of scoring rules and just try to guess from others' actions and by looking others' cards through some actions what should you do and what should not. It's really fun to play, it has the best cutthroat moments, because they build up for a long time and feel like masterplans, even if they don't work out that well in the end. The only flaw I have is the high possibility of ignoring points scoring, as 3 of 4 players just perma-lose cause of some rules, but I think it's because I didn't play a lot of matches for now. Though the theme is very raw, the design is pretty ok, everything, except for the gameboard, looks stylish and gothic. Gameboard for the workerplacement game is pretty hard to orient in, if you didn't play for several matches already. Overall awesome game, one of my favourites.

Amusingly translatey location names.  I didn't feel especially compelled to look at others' cards, but I didn't win, so what do I know?  Overall, I'm inclined to think that I'd like one with fewer moving parts, but not TOO many.  The owner suggested Sid Sackson's "Haggle" for that - hm.

A Filler Worker Placement with lots of Bluffing. It's a really unique game. The Science Fiction theme, the Anime artwork, the bluffing with the worker placement mechanic... It's really original, but once again bluffing is not something I enjoy playing, and with this game you can make a player lose with a single movement.

What I enjoy is that while the mechanics are extremely simple, weighing your choices based on what limited information that you have to acquire or shift resources or to gather more information.

Initial Thoughts:
--------------------
Flux done right?  The board Interface design is horrible, and makes teaching the game way tougher than it needs to be.  It was fun to use the basic worker placement actions to change the scoring, collect scoring, and to figure out the elements of scoring I didn't know.  Looking forward to many more plays of this.  Wish it supported more than 4 players.

A surprisingly solid worker placement game. Play as AI competing to build the best memorial to humanity. With 5 rounds and 3 actions per round every choice matters. However you only know a fraction of how the game will be scored and must find out more.

I think this game has the potential to be good, but in an attempt to shorten the instructions, they became WAY too vague.  There are a ton of unanswered things about the game and it's really confusing because of it.  I intend to give it another shot, but I certainly don't hold out any hope.

Disappointing. After loving Tragedy Looper I had high hopes for this game.
The gameplay is as simple as it gets: you have 3 workers to place each turn. That's it.
The scoring is done with randomized hidden objective cards. Cooperating and colluding is by far the best way to score, but this feels like cheating.
Shallow and uninteresting. Board itself looks bad.

RATING: 9
A quick and fun worker placement game with a great twist.  Unlike normal worker placements where the components have fixed victory points, this game uses a mechanic known as "memories" that dictates the end game scoring and the only way to discover all of the memories is to balance resource gathering with attacks on other players.  Very cool premise with great artwork and fast play (generally 45 minutes).  Only negative is in some games a memory can completely undo your plans and if you don't see it until later in the game it is very hard to recover.

RATING: 5
A light worker placement with a deduction element. The components were pretty bad for the International edition. I have no idea what they'll be like for Z-Man's. Every player has cards that affect the end game scoring for everyone (ala Troyes, but much more dramatic... ie lose if you have the least of X, etc). The problem is you don't have time to collect resources for scoring and check everyone's cards, so you're supposed to balance this and make assumptions based on the actions of others. This seems like a decent concept. In the end, it feels like you randomly get hosed or you win because of cards that you didn't check or other people didn't check. It would probably be a better game if the cards didn't have such dramatic effects.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I would rate the game a six if the board, icons, and cards were a bit more discernable. The main lure of the game is discovering what your session's victory conditions are, done through a serviceable worker placement. The play time is nice and concise, for it would be frustrating to have your best efforts dashed by hidden information if the game played longer.

Good for those that like that wonky Japanese art and design, bad for those who like functionality.

I actually really enjoyed this one. The rules book is pretty awful and there was a lot of guesswork and half remembered rules from a demo game at Essen ... but we think we worked out how to play.. and actually its pretty good.

Eight rules (nine in the advanced) are in play for any one game which dictate how/if you score points. As a player you only know two of them. over the course of 15 actions you have to work out what scores points and hopefully get more of them than your opponents.

Since you only take 15 actions turns and indeed the whole game is pretty quick. Nice filler to warm up an evening of gaming, looking forward to many more games of this.

Brilliant little game, terrible graphics, absolutely terrible choice of font on the z-man games version that I own.  The cards are fine but the board is just plan unreadable.  But its simple enough that it doesn't take much to memorize the actions on the board so the graphics don't matter any more.  But the game itself is brilliant and never over stays its welcome.  Highly recommended.  A hidden ugly gem.

I've read the rules. Interesting idea, not sure how well it is in practice.

You only see 2/8 of the cards relating to how the final score is calculated. You essentially spend your turns gathering more objects or peeking at another person's card to get a better idea what will be affected by final scoring. You need to observe the other players' actions to try to gather info about what you don't have time to look at.

The main stinker is how there are a few cards that if you don't meet its requirement, you instantly lose. You won't know if the card is in circulation or not until near the end of the game (or not at all), at which case you feel like you randomly got hosed.

Code of Nine is pretty lacking in theme, but it is an interesting mash-up of worker placement and deduction games that plays smooth and quickly. It reminds me a bit of Shadow Hunters with the difference being that players actually decide and compete for information and resources. There is a little bit of luck in the game, but players should able to figure out the majority of the game's objectives before getting the chance to execute some strategy and allow deduction to determine the rest.

I could see my rating going up or down with future plays, but for now, I find it a game I enjoy exploring.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2017)

At first, I was very keen to play Code of Nine. It was designed by BakaFire, the same designer who made the excellent EXCELLENT Tragedy Looper. However, after a while, I began seeing the game deeply discounted and in more and more sales so at the end I wasn’t expecting a lot from it. After playing it, I still have mixed feelings about the game, but it is an unique game.

The game´s components are regular, it comes with generic Ludo pieces for the players :(. The text on the board is very hard to read. I was expecting a lot more from Z-man Games (still a minor issue for me) . The art is very good and the player aids are excellent. The theme is very interesting, but you don´t feel it thought the game, it is, sadly, pasted on.

The rules are much simpler than I expected, you can explain the game under 3 minutes. The rulebook (both versions) could be a lot better. Playtime is less than 30 minutes with 4 players, Code of Nine plays very fast.

The game´s decisions aren’t obvious but they aren’t that hard either. You move your pawn to a free action space, pay for it and execute, that’s it. The game revolves around the items available and the memory cards. The memory cards are the best part of the game, they indicate what gives VPs at the end and they are hidden so you only have 1/4 of the puzzle at the beginning. In some instances, you will see the cards of your opponents and in this case you need to exercise your memory (I love this part of the game). If you cannot see the cards of your opponents you need to deduce what they have based on their movements. (I love this as well).  All the available spaces are known from the beginning, so you can plan your moves.

The expert game is not a lot harder than the regular game, but it gives more options so I prefer to play this way.

Best with 4 players.

Bottom line, Code of Nine is a strange and unique game. It plays very fast and have interesting decisions for such a short game. I’m still undecided if I should keep it in my game collection. I had fun playing it, but I can’t shake a feeling of disappointment. I was expecting a heavy game from BakaFire. All my friends enjoyed the game though.

RATING: 7
Over five rounds, players collect a number of items by placing their three pawns on an ever-increasing number of places to put them -- but there's a catch! Each players also gets two cards which affect the scores, and you can use one pawn to peek at the others'. It's a game of strategy that is affected by the random dealing of the cards. You will find yourself using the back of the manual to understand what each spot does until you gain familiarity with the game, though.

PLUS: challenge level, variety
MINUS: the need of reference, theme isn't super strong

A quick playing, solid worker placement game with each player having some secret info about the scoring rules. Some actions allow you to get more info and it's somewhat possible to use deduction to find out more. Besides that a typical worker placement in many ways with some take that and more available actions every round. Components are cheap and the iconography maybe a bit confusing, but I do like the shiny player boards and would like to stress that there isn't anything chaotic and once you get past the oddly written rules it's also quick and easy to teach.

This game has some deduction, some worker placement, some resource collecting and minor bluffing all wrapped up in chaos.   It sounded like a mess when it was being explained to me, but somehow it's the perfect length and amount of chaos.  I had a lot of fun playing this and so did everyone else involved.  I'm not sure if it came together through fantastic design or happy accident, but there's exactly enough time to get in, make a plan, get some info, possibly change that plan and get out in under an hour.


I should note that I played a homemade version of this game created by a fan who was appalled by the graphic design of the actual production copy game.

Great WP game that is exciting, tense, and quick.  I am not much of a fan of WP games, but I really liked this one.  Few choices, but very significant.  Little time for AP (analysis paralysis).  Exciting because you never know for sure whether what you are doing could come back to haunt you later on.  Very easy to teach, pick up and play.  Once you start getting a sense of the different hidden objectives the deduction/bluffing aspect starts to bloom, hence a game that rewards experience and repeated plays.  The only downside is the appearance of the game -- it really does not look good, and the theme feels like an afterthought (especially if you don't know the anime it is based upon).  Perfect example to show that the most important thing about a game is the mechanics, how it plays and whether it's fun to play, not how it looks.  I was ready to play a second match right away.  One of my favorite WP games that in my opinion is even better than just a WP game.

Really quirky and unique worker placement game. The WP is almost secondary to the deduction element though, which I think makes for a very interesting experience.

The central concept of Code of Nine is that players start the game knowing exactly a quarter of the endgame objectives. Players then spend the rest of the game collecting resources for objectives, or attempt to suss out the remaining objectives.

While the central concept is neat, the endgame objectives are incredibly swingy. We're talking "gain 50VP" and "you lose the game" kind of arbitrary here. Plus, the basic worker placement system isn’t an ideal medium to feint and deduce opponents’ motives.  The functionality of the graphic design – spindly typefaces and unintuitive icons – is also questionable. Still, this plays quickly enough and it is hilarious to see players crash and burn amidst the chaos the first few times. This game could have definitely benefited from another round of polishing though.

The theme is amazing, but the game ends too quickly to both get a good feel for the scoring goals and act on them. Even a single unknown goal, or one discovered too late, can change everything.

I suppose one can argue that deduction can play a part, but it's still so tight a game that it saps a lot of the fun out.

I wanted to give this a 9 based on the description, but I guess it's upside down now.

A short worker placement game of chaos? Let's break it down.

Short. The game lasts five rounds, each player gets three actions per round, and the actions themselves are pretty simple. So I don't see this game ever really taking more than 30 minutes.

Worker placement. The gameplay is some of the simplest around. There are a few different types of items and the different spaces basically just give you those different items. There are also a few spaces that do special things like let you steal an item from another player.

Chaos. The chaos is in the lack of information. There are eight cards that will score at the end of the game but you only know two of those cards. In this way, information actually becomes a resource because some spaces let you look at the other cards to have a better idea of the end-game scoring. The game has a simple balance of taking actions to get information versus taking actions to get more stuff.

All in all it's fun. The design of the board could be better and the production feels a little cheap, similar to Tragedy Looper from the same publisher and designer.

Owacon plays quickly, and I had fun during my first play of it. However, it is not a game that I would suggest to get to the table again. My main gripe is with the most original part of the game: the two scoring cards that players conceal from their opponents. The game is over before you got the chance to look at all the cards, and some of the cards are really devastating (like players being removed from scoring if they do not have any coins). Also, some of the actions that become available at the end of the game can really mess over any kind of plan that a player might have had. This all gave me the feeling that I could just as easily win the game by blindly grabbing some resources. Still, I had fun during the game, because I was still trying to deduce information from my opponents' actions - always a fun thing to do.

RATING: 5
In a backward kind of way, this is a microgame that comes in a full-size box. Most of the board is wasted space and the various tokens that get shuffled around could have probably been tracked in a different way, allowing this to ship as a $15 card game instead of a $40 board game. 

The essence of the game is that players will take turns placing workers to acquire tokens of various types. These tokens all more or less have the same baseline value, but that value can change based on a set of end game scoring conditions, some positive and some negative, that are randomly dealt out for each game. Each player will know two of the eight conditions in play and must deduce what the other six are, based on their opponent's behavior and a few opportunities to peek at a couple over the course of the game. The game then is in trying to figure out what the most valuable things to acquire will be, as well as how to get rid of any poison pills you discover.

It's fine, but strangely devoid of any sort of narrative arc. I am not familiar with the anime it is based on, so maybe there is something there I'm missing. It is sometimes easier to project your imagination and fill in the blanks on a game like this, when the IP is familiar. Sadly, I could not.

RATING: 6
This game is so uniquely clever and balances its mechanisms perfectly. The fact that it plays in 20-30 minutes seals the deal. The downside is that the game benefits from multiple plays with the same people as there's a lot to be gained from meta-knowledge. It can seem pretty random before that point.

Addendum: I've only ever met one other person who agrees with me that this game is clever. Cindy actively HATES it.

This is BakaFire wacky, and I say that as a compliment. I love the idea of weighing your actions to accomplish your known goals, based on the few memories you still have, against trying to recover more memories.

This is a strange game, and I want to try to Expert rules before casting judgment.

Fun party game, but only plays to 8 people.

I've found the base game is almost too simple, but adding in the player power cards makes it too convoluted for lots of groups to reconcile the individual rounds. I love it as a party game, but I almost never use the power cards as a result...

RATING: 9
An extremely fun, wild, and crazy party-ish game. It seems that pointing guns at each other is a lot of fun. I'm not a huge fan of the Munchkin-esque art, especially when you compare it to the first edition, but the gameplay is better in the second edition. The super powers are pretty tame, though, compared to the crazy ones in the first edition. The godfather mechanic and the loot cards/distribution make this the better game, though.

Fun game that gets a lot of laughs.  Not a lot of depth in this game at all, but that can be forgiven because of the games brevity and foam guns.

Resolving the pointed guns is a pain in the butt, btw.

RATING: 7.5
Truth be told, I played this game wrong the first time it hit the table. I was all excited for it. I had seen the Shut Up and Sit Down video review and thought the game looked exciting and unique and full of laughs. But when we sat down to play it, with my stupid misinterpretation of the rules, it went over like a sad trombone. Some of my friends consoled me, saying, "It was fun! I kind of liked it. It wasn't terrible. It was..."

Some months later, I decided to resurrect the game. Give it another shot. Look that single page of rules over again to make sure I wasn't playing it wrong. I was horrified to see that, yes, I had played it wrong. I played it with my family and we did what never really happens - we played it again! And again! My nieces loved it. My parents laughed and acted like tough guys from the movies. My dad singled me out and...killed me. It was fun!

LIKE: Fun to try to grab all the cash.
DISLIKE: Guns pointing at people. I understand some people are ok with it, but it's not my thing.

OVERALL: Not a bad game. It's social yet doesn't need a role or lying element.

Very light and limited replayability, but it was fun for one play.  Would be best when played with kids.

RATING: 9
Crushes C&G's first edition. The simple draft mechanic add so much to this without adding complexity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For larger groups this brings hilarious moments, and a lot of outguessing with three layers of bluffing. First you choose your bullet, then your target and finally whether you dodge the bullet or not. I quite liked it.

I reckon I would not play this with less than 6 players. You definitely need that chaos for this game to be any fun. With lower player numbers, player elimination will change the balance of the game too much.

Not too sure about the special powers. They just might make the game drag a bit and make it too complicated for what it really is. Otherwise, ok fun for certain occasions.

RATING: 7
Yet to play with many of the new rules (the various roles and the godfather forcing people to change) but the base game just falls a little short of the original. Maybe it's because I remember the original through rose tinted glasses but the lack of Bang! Bang! Bang! cards takes away an element and I'm not convinced by the paintings and diamonds.

+ The Blackmailer.

Ca$h 'n Guns is an easy and silly party game. I really like the artwork of the new edition, the quality of the components and the new drafting mechanic for the loot splitting. I also love to introduce it to new players and look at their faces, when they see those foam guns!

Unfortunately though the game doesn't excite me as I thought it would have. Its fun factor seems to follow a descending parabola. The first time you point foam guns at each other causes a lot of laughter, but you have to keep doing it for 8 turns... and after 4 or 5 of them it's just tha same all over again. The idea is great, the components are awesome, but the game behind all of this is very repetitive. Not the great party experience I was hoping for.

Um jogo bem divertido para jogar com amigos. Não tão dependente de mesa como muitos party games e a arte de John Kovalic engrandece e muito a diversão.

4-8. Good game, but not sure where I can play it..!

RATING: 7
Better than the first edition, and I already liked that one quite a bit.  Plays up to 8 which is excellent.

1st play: Better than the original, but I played with a bunch of non gamers.  We had fun with it but none of them wanted to play a 2nd time.  It could have been the problem that we had 5 kids at the table, and this is probably more of an adult game.

2nd play: I still own it and I think it's better than first edition.  The Godfather having a power makes for some variety.

Tema molto simpatico.Le pistole al tavolo fanno la differenza.Ci si sfida di continuo e alla fine rimane in piedi solo il piu duro.Occhio però:il gioco è ben studiato per evitare che per partito preso si rimanga in piedi sempre e comunque a sfidare gli altri.Se vieni colpito un tot di volte,non importa quante ricchezze tu abbia accumulato....sei fuori dal gioco e non puoi essere dichiarato vincitore!Da provare le abilità speciali dei personaggi.Consigliato.

Excellent light fun. You can explain this in about three minutes and everyone gets it. This works perfectly amongst groups that don't usually game but equally well as a filler with hardened gamers. Every time I've played it, it's been a blast. Pointing foam guns at people is fun. And, yes, this is better than the first edition. The artwork is better and I really don't care all that much about the bang, bang, bang card.

Great mixed company party game- works well with kids, while drinking, or both. Has the right amount of interactivity and the possibility of dealmaking, but vendettas tend to carry the day. Not a ton of strategy buyond the political squabbling, but enough of a draft sub theme that it stays interesting.

The initial plays were very entertaining. All of them were played with the expansion rules included. It's a simple game that gets a lot of attention from the players. Everybody wants to try it thanks to the nice toy guns. 

The theme is not suitable for everyone. Some people do find it offensive so it's wise to ask for everyone's feelings about the setting before dropping this on the table.

I realized that I really love the concept of this game, but always feel kinda bored and confused when playing. There's very rarely a logical motivation to pick a target beyond just messing with your friends and the player elimination can be pretty rough. I've heard that the expansions are really good, but I haven't played them so I don't know.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Streamlines out the BANG! BANG! BANG! cards, but adds in more complexity in the loot collection. Instead of just splitting the loot pile as evenly as possible, surviving player draft the pile on item at a time. There's more to get beside money as well, such as paintings (increase in value with each new painting in a player's collection), jewelry (person with the most at endgame gets a huge bonus), card that heal you or let put cards back into your hand and the first player token.

I like the new art better than the original.

The special role cards can add some extra fun, but you shouldn't play for a first go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Game is a lot of fun, as with all other social games, the right group is key. But the concept is hilarious, and the foam guns are a nice touch. It'd be great if there were an expansion with extra abilities for each character or something to that extent but the vanilla version (as it currently exists) is a lot of fun and has a ton of replay value. If you like social deduction and/or pointing foam guns at friends and bluffing on whether or not a bullet is in the chamber then this is for you.

This is a rather silly party game, about Mexican standoffs!
Every round, each player loads his/her gun with a bullet or leaves the barrel empty, then everybody simultaneously points their gun to another player.
Each player can duck or be bold and risk,catching a bullet...
Only those who are left standing participate in the drafting of the booty...

This game is ideal for drinking evenings, when everybody wants to laugh!

I am a pacifist and although I dont mind violence in games I found the whole concept of cash and guns something that left me a bit cold.  On the positives this is a fun, light game that works with big numbers and makes a change from the hidden role games.  Nothing here I really like other than its harmlessness and variety.  A great game to include in a game night for a large number of players but not a game I would ever seek out otherwise.

This is a fun ice-breaker to take to game days.  The art is fun but not too silly, the game dynamics and goals give you different paths to victory.  The props and game pieces are thoroughly entertaining.

I'm not a "game master" type person - memorizing extensive rules to be the "living rule book" for newbies.  This game, however, is really easy to pick up, even without knowing all the rules.  I can easily explain it to a new group of people and get everyone playing in minutes.

That being said, there are specific "powers" and nuances in the rules that make the game a lot more fun and interesting, so it's worth the couple "clunky" play-throughs to get the rules down.

I found that some people (especially with children) are sensitive to pointing a toy gun at another person, but they really liked the game if we simply "pointed" at each other (vs. using the foam gun props).

Very fun party style game, complete with foam guns you get to aim at your friends. What they don't know is whether your gun is loaded. Get through this and your reward is to pick up your selection of this round's loot. 

The second edition streamlines some things and makes the game flow smoother. I recommend the team spirit expansion to add the possibility for team play to up the strategy a little and add some intrigue.

A great filler of loud and light-hearted fun, this second edition of Cash and Guns improves on the original game by simply making it easier and drawing everyone’s attention to its core: that is, interaction, betrayal, bluffing and bashing that one player just because he shot you last turn or is collecting more loot than anyone else.

I'll admit that I got this game mostly because you point foam guns at each other. 

Fight over a pot of money by pointing guns at your fellows, but you never know if they have a blank in their weapon or not. Stare them down as you decide to risk it for the cash. Maybe they'll shoot you, just shoot them back next round. 

Fun for 4-8 players. Special powers add additional replayability

Game improves when ALL players know what they're doing. Grudges and sub-optimal (playing with a group of children) play often lead to a runaway leader, and no fun for players who are looking for strategy.

Great party game. 'Mexican standoff the game'. Players point guns at players they choose which may or may not be loaded and may chicken out. Surviving players choose from different loot on table. Highest loot value at end of game wins. Fast paced, pointing guns at people will freak out parents, interesting mechanics with changing who you choose to shoot at and different loot goals

Reservoir Dogs the game, perfect to get people laughing at each other, and even better cathartic effects for any frustrations at the end of a long gaming session.

Really really simple.  But for a light bluffing party game this is just about perfect.  The reservoir dogs style theme and pointing toy guns at people is really fun.  Good with groups of a lot of different sizes.   The drafting and different types of loot are fun and add a little extra to the game.  The different character powers add some nice replay value too.

I don't like this game for the same reason I don't like One Night Ultimate Werewolf: it doesn't give you enough of a reason to accuse one person over another. It just gives you a blank slate and says "okay, start lying now please", which really kills both games for me. However, it is marginally entertaining with the right group.

Incredibly fun once we got going, but it took a couple rounds for people to 'get' it...which I normally wouldn't have a problem with! However I imagine this game absolutely shines best with people who don't want a long rules explanation.

Granted I've only played once so maybe I just need to get my rules explanation for this one down a little better :)

RATING: 7
A great example of social deduction with just enough structure and complexity to make it feel satisfying mechanically. Still super light, and the production values are excellent. Pointing foam guns at each others? Multiple strategies? Mind games? Count me in. Great game in the genre. The only thing is that it really is an individual struggle without a lot of "team" dynamics. Also, peoples feelings might get hurt? But perhaps no more than in werewolf.

Got eliminated as soon as possible in the game and had to stare at the other people during the rest of the game. But I admit it is fun, the new guns from the expansions are cool and playing in teams is possible too and that's quite interesting.

Ill be honest i really really enjoyed playing this game with strangers at gencon the first time i played it. like probably a 7 or 8 rating worth of enjoyment. But when i got back home and played it with my local game group i realized how terrible it felt to point guns even toy ones, at my friends. Some of the were really uncomfortable having guns pointed at them as well. Then i looked around and saw some a family come into the shop to buy comics and left seemingly appalled at us pointing guns at each other. we stopped playing before we even finished and ill never play this game again. Having guns pointed at you can be a real trigger for some people and you never know who you're playing with. I don't even like having this game in my house. But besides all that i did enjoy the game. with a different theme and pointing your finger(not pretending its a gun) i would give this a much much higher rating

ganging up on certain people can really drag this down and remove the enjoyment which can be remedied by playng with strangers.

RATING: 4
Definitely better than the first edition. Although still a rather chaotic ride with little ability to control your destiny. However, play without the powers, they make the game even more chaotic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Overall this is a nice simplification of the original system, and increasing to 8 players max is perfect for this sort of game. This nails the "party" game feel the original game was going for better.

I do miss the Bang Bang Bangs, though. It made the bluffing game a lot more interesting IMO even if they were kind of confusing for new players. It does feel like this version lacks a little something.

The new loot system, though is definitely an improvement. Having multiple ways to score combined with self-selection does a much better job at obscuring the leader so everyone is not always after the same one target. Especially now that the godfather exists and is also often just a target in themselves.

Man, though, I really wish this had given me a way to carry over my shotgun and uzi.

RATING: 6
Played this one just a couple times, but I'd love to have a copy of it. It's fast paced, and action packed. 

You are playing as mobsters or gangsters who are trying to divide up the cash between heists. But as usual, things go wrong. Everyone agreed to divide it up evenly, but then someone has to go and pull a gun! So, naturally, everyone else is going to point their gun too. Got guns pointed at you? If you do, you have to decide if you're going to call their bluff and stick it out, or dive under the table. 

It plays so well, I think my group would really enjoy it, I want a copy for myself!

I bought this because I thought it would be fun for my family to play 4 player.  I was wrong.  It was not fun for 4 players.

Cash n Guns is a game that I owned (the first edition), traded away, and then started regretting that decision. It's not for everyone, but it is probably the closest thing to a party game that I really enjoy.

At the end of the day, pointing foam guns at each other is just a big ol' bucket of fun. It generates laughs. It's easy to teach, quick to play... it's simple and silly fun in a box.

Having played both editions now, I give the slight nod to the 2nd edition. The new artwork is safer for a broader audience, and that's fine by me. The addition of loot types such as diamonds and paintings works well, and the godfather role is a good add. Not sure you need to buy the new addition if you have the old, but if you're deciding between the two, pick up the later copy IMHO.

Devoid of meaningful decisions, has hidden trackable information, gets repetitive and boring.

Why did it have to be Kovalic? Anyways, this loot mechanic sounds cool. I might just buy it and keep using the old artwork for the characters themselves. The wider player range also is useful.

Pros:

Cons:
-Boss role feels unnecessary
-no chicken tokens
-no undercover cop

I would honestly prefer if I could mix and match elements from the two editions, but the utterly horrible artwork prevents me from doing so... oh well.

I had very bad experiences when playing the first edition of this game. So much so I decided I'd never play it again. 

The second edition, however, has been massively helped by the fact that I'm not surrounded by a bunch of Alpha Gamers who all think that as soon as someone has taken a wound, that you need to always point at the wounded player with loaded guns every round after that. As I pointed out then, a dead player never beats you, but you don't win if everyone else is getting to pick the nice loot at the same time.

A very mean party game.  This is the game to play when you straight up feel like screwing someone over.  You have to play this game with a light heart or you will hate it.  A game where king making and alliances is encouraged but doesn't ruin the game.  Also it never takes longer than 30 minutes so even if you are eliminated you'll be alright.  MUST BE played with more than 5 players! Highly recommend as a beer and pretzels party game.

There's something in Cash n Guns that I just simply had to give up on bluffing games.

An awesome party game with fun components.  The only negatives are the player elimination and its a bit too "take that" for my tastes. Great game nonetheless.

The original Cash 'n Guns is amazing.  When I read the revised rules for version two, I knew that the creators had somehow improved on one of the best games of all time.  The new rules for dividing up loot, as well as having different kinds of loot, are pure genius.  There is not a single tweak to the game that I dislike.  The Godfather adds an awesome dynamic.  The elimination of the triple bang cards sure makes it easier explaining the game to first timers.  And, best of all, now 8 players can play!  

This new version is totally awesome!

Picked this up to play with the family, but it never caught on. While it has a nice theme and seemed like it would be a silly kind of blast, it ended up feeling like some huge variant of Rock/Paper/Scissors. When someone wanted it to fill out a trade no one in the family objected.

CASH 'N GUNS (SECOND EDITION)
Reasons why I like this better than the 1st ediion:
Better artwork
More varied loot (gems, paintings, cash, first aid kits, and extra bullets)
Character cards
Plays 8 instead of 6
Drafting of loot
Glad I switched!

Fun party game for 4 -8 players. I wanted something fun for this number of people when we have another family round.  It is a combination of luck, bluff and strategy in just the right amounts. Having 8 guns in the house with live ammo and pointing them at each other gives me a flavour of what it must be like to live in certain American states! Traded.

Upon first hearing about the game, I was very excited about it and had very high expectations. Face it, don't we all want to be in a Mexican standoff with a bunch of friends and hold guns in each other's faces? In addition to the coolness factor, the serious gamer in me liked the revised loot distribution that should provide some strategic depth. 

After playing it with a group of friends, I found all of the above to be true. However, the game proved to be less fun than I anticipated. I realized that it is only fun for a specific audience, namely a group that (1) are very close-knit (2) do not strategize at all and play strictly for fun AND (3) have good imagination and like to role-play.

My group consisted of high-functioning and competitive people, so the game proceeded slowly while everyone took a long time to calculate the best target and loot. There were also tense moments when one player publicly called for others to target a particular player because s/he was doing "too well." Also, players formed alliances then betrayed each other. These were smart, strategic moves for sure, but took away the relaxing atmosphere. And of course no one role-played so the shooting phase was dull.

This is an innovative game but definitely not for my group. I know it will work better with a strictly casual one, but then I wonder whether the complex scoring rules for different types of loot will just stand in the way of fun gun-pointing.

This game is pretty good if you have lots of people. Wasn't impressed with 4 players, so more than that. Played with 7 & 8, and it was fun. Everyone liked it, but I think Bang! is more fun.

I was instantly sold on the idea of pointing foam guns at each other. This game is easy to learn and people get a grasp of the game's mechanic quickly.

It's a fun game, but I guess it really shines if you're playing with people who get agitated easily and curse a lot (to get the gangster feeling, that is).

I haven't played with the character cards and abilities yet, but I figure this introduces some replayability (and asymetry) to the game once the base variant gets old.

Players are gangsters, divided in a Mexican stand-off, arguing over a fair share of the loot.

Second edition, and much improved version of Cash n Guns.  Several changes make the game a much more streamlined, and enjoyable, experience.  The addition of the loot draft, the role of the Godfather, and the removal of the Bang Bang Bang cards are all positives.  

The new art isn't as effective, but the game is so much better.  Good job.

I've never had the benefit of playing this game with a group of people taking it seriously. I mean, if you want to be lighthearted that's one thing, but when you randomly pick or your bullet card or spin your gun on the table to determine who you're shooting at this turn, the whole game suffers notably. Which is a shame, because it's an otherwise fun game.

Complicated feelings on this game. I like the mechanics: trick bullets, set collection and bluffs. However, it's very hard for feelings not to get entwined, at least with my game group - not lessened that decisions are rarely personal but often just a toss of the coin. "I just shot you because I had to shoot someone" doesn't cheer anyone up - just makes them more frustrated the randomness took them out.

While you can always argue that it's 'just a game' or that they 'took a risk' and 'should have bowed out that round,' but it's unfortunate when someone who is doing well is completely eliminated because three people just happened to point to them and all happened to load bullets. I've found it difficult to restore morale to the group after such an occurrence.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A VERY light party game involving bluffing and acting like a little kid.  This game felt like some kids made up the rules in the playground of an Elementary School during lunch recess.  Its simple (once you get into the rhythm), fast and really feels like “play.”  The game lasts just about as long as it should (when we got to our final round, I was ready for it to end).  You really need to play this with a large group of the right (non-serious-minded) people and best on a circular table.  I felt like an eight year old kid again in the school yard playing this.   

However, when all is said and done, I think the theme and the player-elimination game-mechanic is what nocked a bit off its rating here.

This is a party game in which players are a group of crooks dividing up their most recent haul of loot.  Every round players will simultaneously point their foam guns at each other in a standoff and then players can choose to stay or drop out.  Players who stayed and whose target also is still in will then reveal their bullet card to show whether or not they fired a shot or bluffed with a click.  Wounded players are then removed.  The remaining players take turns picking out the loot.  The player with the most valuable loot at the end of 8 rounds wins!

This is an improvement from the first edition as there are loot other than cash that score differently.  Paintings start low, but increase quite a bit in value with every additional painting you collect.  Diamonds have variable values but the person with the most diamond loot cards gets an additional 60k at the end!  There are also optional player powers that you can choose to use to add another layer of complexity.

This is a really fun party game that is fairly easy to teach and a blast to play!  It plays from 4-8, and the more the merrier.  It's not just pointing guns at each other, although that can be quite fun.  There are still decisions to be made and some memory involved to figure out who has collected what.  I definitely recommend this game.

It's going to depend a whole lot on the group, and I appreciate that some groups have a blast with this.  I've never been rocked by this game.   

It runs too long, and runs *particularly* too long for a game of quite sudden elimination (if a newbie isn't paying enough attention, for example, and gets hit harder than they expected).   It takes too much setup, at least with the new modules, and I've repeatedly seen it take too long to teach, though I think it is possible to teach it *during* play using a first quick round and then a reset.  

I've played both editions, and also three games with various expansion modules mixed in.

Some powers are hugely more useful than others, which would again be fine in a *short* game.

In the team games, due to player elimination, I think there's a runaway leader problem.  If you have more players, you have more agency (you are simply firing more bullets), more ways to get further ahead.

Like munchkin, the best moments are reliant on a perfect storm of power plays to add surprise and reversals, and often those storms simply don't emerge.  That's fine in a ten minute game but not in a game that can run 90 minutes ("30 minutes" on the box).

It does an ok-ish job of trying to craft a game around pointing guns at each other, but it's not a game I enjoy (and I sure do loves me a party game).

I'd sooner play Dead Last, in a fraction of the time, with minimal setup, and get straight to the bluff and double-bluff mind games which ought to be cash and guns's bread and butter, but which it often fails to provide.

I have played the original version and had a quick demo game of this version and honestly I think I prefer this newer version.

For me the game play tweaks add a bit more structure and give you things to aim for in a turn adding at least a little strategy. 
All to often we found the original version was more a popularity contest than a tactical game, each player picking a share of the pot rather than having to equally split it between all those that remain is a really welcome addition, plus I personally prefer the more cartoon art style.

Jópofa partyjátéknak tűnt a képek alapján, ezért régóta érdekelt. Élőben nem annyira jött be. Tudom én, hogy egy partyjáték nem sakkvilágbajnokság, de legalább minimális ráhatásod azért lehetne a játékra. Ez így csak fogjunk egymásra vízipisztolyt, és találjunk ki hozzá valami értelmetlen körítést. Nem mondom, van az az alkoholmennyiség, amikor jó lehet, de ez már nem a játék érdeme, hanem a szeszfőzőké.

One of my favorites! The theme is just great and it makes me feel like being in the movies. Maybe not a game for everyone, but luckily I only know fun people who don't take things too personally. I could play this over and over, just the fact that you can point guns at your friends, family and spouse and laugh is just the best.

Not a fan. Too social and take-that oriented. The theme is also pretty dicey - I am sure some groups enjoy pointing weapons at each other, but not all groups will.

2nd edition really streamlines the game and removes the fiddly carry over loot. Also no more bang bang bang so people aren't eliminated as suddenly. The loot is more interesting and there is a godfather ability now 

The game is just silly fun with the foam guns and plays fast. Really solid party game for people who like to "fight" each other

Party bluffing game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game is light, fun and silly. It is trying to get some depth with the different sorts of goods you can buy. There are three core mechanics:
1. Do I choose to load my gun this turn or bluff? This one is working ok, because there is very little strategy to decide whether to bluff or not this turn. Fair enough, you might look at the goods in play, but valuable goods are valuable to everyone, so there are basically turns that are worth it and turns that aren't. So that feels a bit random.
2. Who do I point my gun to? This one doesn't really work for me. I still don't understand how we are meant to choose. So we all ended up pointing at the godfather each time.
3. When at gun point, do I stand or quit? This one works quite well for me. You're looking at your opponent in the eyes and try to gauge his bluff.

In addition, the attribute cards did not work for me, they were too powerful and completely channeled gameplay. Just not fun. Finally, I am not a fan of player elimination. And players falling behind are unlikely to be able to catch up.

After one play. A lot of fun with a casual group. Great party game. Politically, I am very wary of guns and the prevalence of gun violence, and I had reservations about playing this game, but found myself to be a big fan of this game in a social setting with mature gamers.

Great when playing with lots of people, who are casual gamers or non-gamers and a party atmosphere. With smaller groups of people, or people who want strategy/thinky games, I wouldn't pull this out.

Update: After two more plays, the fun wore off quickly. Player elimination can be an issue, especially with larger groups (which is the whole point of playing this game). Not holding on to this one.

Played with 6 players and 4 players.  Clearly a much better game with more people.

It's fun, and especially if you have someone who is keeping it moving, it goes quick and doesn't drag.  Can teach and play a full game in under a half hour.

It obviously has an element of going after certain people, and it's part and parcel to the game.  I think I like it better without the godfather, as it seemed to neutralize it when we played without it in our second game.

Really a game that is tough to not have fun with.

Cash and Guns is a really fun party game for up to 8 people, and I've found it works in pretty much every player range (4-8).

Barely a game at all.  It's mostly just luck and for a large, almost 'Party' game it allows players to get knocked out quite quickly and then just sit around watching everyone else not really enjoy themselves.  One of the few games where I will actively try to dissuade people from playing it.  If it does hit the table I just find an excuse to do something else, like sitting and staring at a wall, or calling my mother.

Point your foam pistol (and no, that is not a euphemism) at your opponents.  Bluff them into foresaking a share of the loot.  A very easy game to pick up, if you get over people pointing guns millimetres away from your face that is.  And the ability to collect loot plus the special abilities of the characters in the game keep things that bit fresh.  Biggest drawback is the box - there really needs to be a tray to sort stuff out in.

This is a one hit wonder.. you play it, you point foam guns at each other & think, GREAT!
Then you realize there is no strategy.. none.. there's no way of knowing who will be pointing their gun at you & thus no way of choosing anyone over someone else as your victim.

Chances are, that if you're crazy about party games, like cards against humanity & munchkin, you'll probably enjoy this one.
Everyone else, better go for a walk in the early morning.

I played both versions, the game play is pretty much the same.

I played Ca$h 'n Guns twice in May, and quickly put it on my Christmas list. We broke it out a few times at New Year's. The theming is very fun. It's hard to resist taking a picture when the entire family is in a big-screen-like hold-up. The rules are straightforward, which helps the game un-savvy, but they're layered enough to keep the more competitive people engaged. If you're good with counting cards, there's a lot to use your counting muscle here. I'm definitely interested in getting this game out to more people and seeing if I can figure out my best plan of attack. As it stands now, I don't feel like I always find my best target in the first phase, and I imagine there's ways to make myself less visible as a target when I start to get more loot.

Ca$h 'n Guns isn't a hard game to get others to try as the prospect of wielding foam pistols is usually an easy sell. What is difficult to predict is how enjoyable the group will find the experience. I find the game plays best with players who at least somewhat know each other (which often makes for a hilarious and quickly developed metagame). For other groups, the shallowness of the gameplay becomes an issue as players lack the motivation for actions such a metagame provides. Nonetheless, it's still a fun game worth pulling out to experience from time to time.

Fun filler. You can't help but have a good time when you're pointing foam guns at your friends and talking in stupid gangster voices. The more players the better for this one.

If you can get past the obvious issue of pointing toy guns at friends and loved ones, this is a great time.  I don't normally like games with "take-that" in them, but it feels different here since that is really just a tool to help gather sets, value, etc. . .  Lots of fun to be had!

Rating this the same as the original until I have more plays but on first play.

Pros
Drafting rewards
Variety of rewards

Unsure about weither the godfather is over powered but I think he needs to be made a target due to his shot somebody else action.
Even though I havn't played with the undercover cop in the original game it would have been nice to include it.

Removes the "Bang! Bang! Bang!" card in exchange for a Godfather role that allows one person to change someone's target -- and it loses something. Loot values are also increased.

PLUS: cooler-looking guns, increased money values for loot
MINUS: the loss of "Bang! Bang! Bang!"
MEH: new artwork looks too cartoony to boot

RATING: 5
Simple fun game that can be used as filler between more serious games.  I originally bought it to provide an alternative to our usual The Resistance: Avalon game nights with my friends who tend to prefer the more casual end of the game spectrum.  It hasn't managed to dislodge Avalon from top spot but it does see play every now and then.

We are thieves who perform eight successful robberies no problem. The most dangerous part of the job? Dividing the loot. Each turn, loot cards are put in the center of the table. Everyone secretly loads their gun with a blank or a bullet (you start with 5 blanks and 3 bullets). At the same time, everyone points their gun at another player. You can back out at this point, but if you stay in you could be shot. Three shot knock you out of the game. If you are not shot (nobody pointed at you or it was a blank) and do not back out the remaining players start taking loot one at a time starting with the godfather. The loot can be straight up money of various denominations, paintings you collect sets of, diamonds you collect a majority of, more ammo, healing of wounds, or the right to become the next godfather. Most money among the survivors at the end of eight rounds wins. Players also each have a special power that bends a rule or two and the godfather can re-direct one gun.

The game is silly, no doubt, with players waving guns in each other's faces and bluffing each other to fold. The different loot types ensures that it is not always clear who is ahead, which is important in a game like this, and from what I understand was a problem in the first edition where there was only one type of loot, money, and games devolved into simple bash-the-leader mentality. I don't think that's as big of a problem here. With all the table-talk, daring, and bravado, this game will always be a winner with the right crowd.

RATING: 8.75
Just a great, fun party style game for a small group.  Awesome.    I don;t much care for the art on this edition, but the gameplay is better than ever with improvements and a slight bit of strategy brought into the mix.  I personally prefer the changes to the core gameplay, even after I thought I wouldn't (having played the first edition game multiple times)!

This is a winner, especially at its price point.

This game tows the line of a party game and a strategy game. The decisions you make in the game are definitely strategic, but the take that nature breeds hilarity in the right group. 

Add to that one of my favorite themes, that one from the end of reservoir dogs, and you have a great game that plays 8 well.

UPDATE: Yeah, I've tired of this game. It isn't interesting and it's all about pointing guns. There's not really strategy to speak of. And one game with an 8-year-old made me swear off playing it with kids. I think he actually wanted to shoot me.

A fairly fun party game that is easy to learn and quick to play. 

My only complain would be that the FFA element can sometimes be a little frustrating depends on the group you are with.  For people who are more serious, its become a game of balancing the field of power/ King-making. For casuals, its become a chaotic brawl fest, which it would be stupid for anyone to even try to win.

Silly game where you point guns at your opponents to split up the loot in the middle of the table. The game plays over eight rounds, but you only have three bullets, so does that guy with his gun pointed at you have a bullet in there or is it an empty threat?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is an excellent party/filler game. It is quick, fun, and easy to teach to pretty much anyone. I have played this with a wide range range of players, and all have enjoyed it and asked to play multiple times. It especially fun if everyone gets into character and role plays a bit.

I have only played with powers once, and was a bit underwhelmed by some of them. Some powers are either not that useful, easily neutralized, or not that fun. They just didn't seem to add anything to the experience, so I doubt I would add them in unless I was playing with people who had played with them before, or who can easily adapt to new games/rules. I have not played with a few of the powers. 

Having said all that, this is one of my favorite party games.

Not very deep, and everyone likes pointing heir guns at me, so I often get eliminated.  I'm fine with being eliminated, and often try to get eliminated if someone else does.  

I don't often like elimination because it gets boring for the eliminated.  It gets some points off for that.

At its core, it is an interesting game full of laughs that accommodates a high player count.  Unfortunately, player elimination and high player counts can leave many people twiddling their thumbs while they wait for the game to finish.  Also, the player powers are possibly not balanced.  Some seem clearly more profitable.

Oct 16/16. The art is better on this version  (2nd edition). With the right group, at the right time (in-between mid to heavy games, an ice breaker or waiting for dinner/players to arrive) this can be a blast. Light weight, simple to teach. Downsides? Not very deep and not a lot of changes once you've grasped it (lather, rinse, repeat). Doesn't get much play but it stays around for that "just in case" moment. Rated 6.

Great game of betrayal and double cross.  Players are gangsters who are seated around a table after a big heist and our goal is to split up the loot.  The gun waving Mexican stand-off that follows is a blast and works surprisingly well with non-gamers.  Plenty there for serious gamers, the game works better with the unique player powers.

A silly party game with some fun bluffing and decisions. Pointing foam guns is a gimmick but one that improves the experience. Expansions improve the game too.

However the game does start to break down at 3 or 4 players if you have had too many player eliminations. You NEED the higher player counts for sure.

Én szeretem a partijátékokat, és a helyén kezelem az ilyen jellegű társasokat, de ebben sajnos nagyon kevés van. A pisztolyfogdosás 5 percig jópofa, de sajnos igazi játék nem lesz belőle, legalábbis nem olyan, amit én szívesen játszanék. Lehet, hogy négyesben nem az igazi, vagy kellene hozzá valami háziszabály, de ez ebben a formában gyenge élmény volt (nem, a társasággal nem volt baj). Nem igazán tudom, hogy kinek ajánlható. Seggrészegen is inkább mást választanék.

A fun party game that focuses on silly showdowns and foam guns being pointed at faces. It's a bit of a game of "chicken" as you gamble on whether your opponents are pointing a loaded gun at you or if they are just using a blank. Treachery and underhandedness is rewarded. Talking like Marlon Brando when you are the Don is encouraged. It can get a bit stale after a few plays, and seems to be enjoyed by younger players mostly.

Ca$h 'n Guns helps you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. The goal is to have the more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.

Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play. First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs. Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a "Bang!" or a "Click! Click!" card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on "Three" each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.

This is one of those games that's more fun depending on player count. Playing with 4 players is pretty fun, but playing with 8 is a madhouse, which is exactly what the game requires. There is strategy, but unfortunately too many people focus on revenge rather than paying attention to who's actually winning, so you could be doing poorly and still see a bunch of guns pointed at you. That brings the score down.

Like so many party games, the success of cash and guns depends a lot on the crowd. If people get into the spirit of the game this can be a blast. If people are a bit shy or not buying into the concept, it can be a bit dull. I like it so I rate it highly.

First impression after only one game.   I did not find any of the elements I usually enjoy in a game.  If I want to play a similar game I would probably play Dead Last which I enjoy very much and I much preferred.  It's possible that this game could get better with repeated plays but I have no desire to ever try it again.

RATING: 8
A little bit of bluffing, trash talking makes this a lot of fun. By about round 7 or 8 it starts to feel like it is dragging (especially if you are out). But it's still pretty short. 

Good game for youth groups or school camps (if you can handle the mafia theme).

Sometimes you want to point foam guns at your friends, other times you want to be civilized and play a thinking-man's game.  This is obviously the first one.  Still fun with the right group, and supports a high player count.  I'd rather play a few other party games over this, but it's not leaving my collection any time soon.

Math on the fly and blustering around pointing guns at my friends, some of my favorite things. We've been trying without special character powers more recently (I learned from the somewhat more streamlined first edition so that's fine with me).

RATING: 8.2
This version took a good game and made it great.  No more Bang Bang Bang vs Bang cards (so confusing to teach and play with), no more simple "divide the loot evenly" rules.  No.  All gone.

Now you have either a Bang card or a Click card.  Every player gets one special power to use throughout the game.  Loot comes in (mainly) three different types: Cash, Art, and Diamonds, and because of the variable worth of Art and Diamonds, it's tough to keep track of who's winning.  Oh, and the Godfather to shake things up a bit.  

What's funny is that it [i]sounds[/i] more complex than the first game, but it's actually quite straightforward and, because of the small element of strategy, more fun.  Definitely a winner.

Now I guess I'll have to get rid of the original version.

Mediocre party game.  Not a fan of the powers though and the shape of the loot cards make it impossible to sleeve.

I only use powers for a low number of players, like 4 or 5, just to make the low player count a bit more interesting.

The unfortunate issue with this game is the player elimination.  While it might seem it is "your fault", I've seen players with only one or two card loots get wiped out of the game "just because"

If the game had better design, they would've done something that punishes carelessly getting shot but not eliminate players.  Maybe paying for medical bills?

Because of player elimination and being focused around a gimmick, I've sold this game.

PLAY THIS WITH THE RIGHT GROUP! If you have someone or multiple people in your group that are passive-agressive, this game is a bad idea. If you have someone in your group that is easily offended, this is not the game to play. If you have a sensitive player in your group, avoid at all costs. If  your group consists of gamers who are interested in playing something on the heavier side, this would be the wrong game. If those qualifiers don't affect your group, then you not only need to play this, you need to own it. Fun game!

It's an ok party game, a little niche though. The idea of pointing foam guns at people for some is really entertaining and hilarious, but for others, such as myself, a little off-putting. It's a push your luck style game, which i generally like. But its luck based on human behavior, not the luck of a random card drawn from a deck. There's player elimination, which is fine thematically, but no one really wants to sit around for another 30 minutes just watching everybody else play.

One of my favorite bluffing games.
Very solid upgrade of the now classic first edition. More familyfriendly art, simplified rules and all the toy guns - what's not to like? Small minus is possibility of player elimination - never a fun mechanic even though it fits the theme here. Other than that this is very fun game and quite unique bluffing experience (very easy to teach too).

The perfect party game.

The foam guns immediatly cranks up the excitement of the room to 10. The rules are simple, yet they leave room to a fair amount of interesting decision making, like in poker, but of course, the amount of luck and chaos involved could be seen as a downside.

RATING: 8
Good:
Bluffing with foam guns to get the largest portion of the loot as possible. Every time we have played it there is loads of laughs. 

This has had great results in encouraging table chatter during and after each game.

It is pretty entertaining braving half the table being gunning for you, and not have any Bangs. It is also pretty entertaining to successfully play a Bang on a foe taking them out of the running for loot distribution.

Bad:
It is a good party game, but the gameplay can get repetitive after only a few games.

This is light and enjoyable for a game just longer than a filler.

I played the original during a CON in Atlanta.  It was ok and before I played I was interested in purchasing it.  However, after a so-so play I removed it from my list.  I have now played the newer version twice and I like it.  It is at the fringe of my gaming wants though and I probably won't purchase it unless I get a really good deal on it or the person in my gaming group gets rid of his copy.

Meh.

This is a classic example of a "fall between the cracks" game.  It tries to be both a party game and something slightly more tactically robust at the same time, and falls short on both counts.  The random loot distributions and totally linear gameplay make planning virtually impossible, but the cumulative scoring means planning is almost essential.  Mediocre execution.

A téma nagyon viccesnek tűnt kívülről; aztán kipróbáltuk. Valahogy nem jött át a dolog, hogy fegyvert fogok a barátaimra. Tudom, ez egy játék, és ha valaki, akkor én vagyok az, aki nem veszi komolyan az ilyen dolgokat, de én sosem voltam fegyvermániás (egy játékpisztolyom sem volt soha, és alapból nem szeretem az erőszakot). Ha pedig ezt kivesszük, egy papírra is felírhatnánk, hogy ki kit választ. És utána az a blöff, hogy tényleg lövök e vagy sem? Tényleg?!? Hát ez roppant izgi.. De sebaj, mert ki lehet esni gyorsan, és ha szerencséd van kiesik valaki más is gyorsan, akivel tudtok valamit játszani, amíg a többiek befejezik a játékot (Bang szindróma..).
A téma nem jön be (szubjektív) + ki lehet esni + nincs túl sok döntési lehetőség (a keresztapa győzködése, ami egyedül vicces) + repetitív. Egy szó mint száz, nem az én játékom.

This may be the easiest game I had in my collection. The fact that I was able to teach my mom and grandparents (grandparents who, mind you, only play Euchre and NOTHING else) and everyone still had a great time. The strategy is pretty shallow as of now, but we've yet to introduce the player powers. So we shall see how those change of the variability. I'm not sure how much more the game can go up. I can see it going down though.

Initial Review: 8

Traded: Just didn't feel like it would hit the table enough. Too simple for us, honestly. Fun, but not our type of game.

Great party game as a gateway or just for fun. With more serious players has great potential for stratetigizing and striking up deals. Can be limited with newbies, however one should still find fun in it by trying to adapt to their group. I personally use a house rule where the person who has the most diamonds (in value)  gets the bonus, and if it ties up then the bonus is split.

[b]Ca$h 'n Guns[/b] was sold via auction 2/14/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]My family and I still enjoy playing this one, but we've found that it works better with higher player counts (at least 5) so it doesn't hit the table as often as we would like. With the holidays fast approaching I'm sure it will see a welcome surge of plays. It is definitely a game that can be picked up by anyone and we've had lots of fun playing with our extended families (especially our parents). However; it has stopped hitting the table in favor of Camel Up and Diamant, which our extended families like better, so it's on the trade block.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Awesome family game to play with our extended family.
- Great components and I prefer the new art style over the old one.
- Simple to teach, I haven't had any problem teaching this.
- I like the draft that takes place at the end of each round to divy up the loot.
- Plays with 4 to 8 players [i](and it still plays quick with 8)[/i].

I can't recommend this highly enough as a great party game to play with friends and family. This game will continue to see lots of play whenever we have people over.[/i]

I would have already owned this one, if it was instantly acessible in my country. I wanted it badly for months and just when I decided to order it from Amazon it just hit me:

I really DON'T want to point a gun at anyone. Maybe I did when I was younger and that's why I thought it would be still cool, but it isn't.

I hate to sound preachy. I 'm not that kind of guy. I am glad though that I didn't embarass myself with this game. 

I love the Godfather movies, but I realized that it's the code of honor that I respect in them and not the guns.

I may sound boring but no guns in the head for me.

My wife is pregnant. In a few months I will have a son. I will let him play whatever he likes but I would really feel ashamed if he learned this game from me.

Fun and shocking the first time you get a foam gun thrown in your face! My goodness!! But the game itself lacks something in the "grab" and hope you beat your opponents score. I really dig the power you feel when playing the "Godfather" with the ability to point the gun somewhere else! Gameplay should be better!

A big improvement on the original edition. The changes make the game quicker to teach and play - which is great for this style of party game. I also enjoy the new art better than the old, and love that it supports 8 players.
I do miss the undercover cop variant, and the Yakuza swords were really cool (although their rules weren't very good) but overall I like this version better.

After having the opportunity to play the first edition, I was eager to acquire the second edition of Cash and Guns.  While it is a fine game, I feel like the simplicity of the first edition is lost because of the loot-picking mechanism; the rounds lose that speed that was so charming about the first game.  Also, why get rid of the "triple-bang" card?

09-12-2014. Rated after 2 plays. Fun, quick game with foam guns. Each turn a series of cards is flipped that showed treasures, diamonds, paintings, medipacs and bullits..

Each turn, you determine if you'll play a 'bang!' or a 'click' card. At the count of 3 you point your gun at someone. Then, the capo may decide to change the target one player is aiming at. Each person then simultaneously decide to drop out, if they drop out they don't get anything. If players continue beyond this point, the 'bang' and 'click' cards are turned to see who is shot. If you're shot, you're out of the round. 

Treasure is divided clockwise between players. Scoring is based on the total worth of the treasures. Fun game. Nice quick bluffing game. I like it.

If you have a larger group that does not mind silliness and fun, then I recommend Cash N Guns. In Cash N Guns players play thugs that have stolen a haul of loot but things take a turn when all players  decide to  turn on each other and take the loot for themselves. Players hold foam guns and point at another player trying to get them to drop out. Players only have three bullet cards so all the players must decide whether to stay in and collect the loot and chance getting shot or bow out in a game of chicken. 

Pros: Supports up to 8 players, Riotous fun gameplay, group interaction 

Cons: does not support low player counts, Player elimination

Nincsen mély merítésem ez tény, DE...
a téma és a netes videók alapján nagyon tetszett, vártam a kipróbálását. Viszont ez a fegyvereket fogunk egymásra (még ha csak habszivacsból is)  nálam túl megy azon a határon, ami a jó ízlést, önfeledt szórakozást és még ki tudja milyen pozitív élményeket rejt. Valahol belül bánt, nem tudom megmondani...
Nem látok benne nagy újrajátszhatóságot sem, ugyanakkor elég nagy a random faktor (ráadásul alaphelyzetben nyilván mindenki a rutinosat üti benne először).
Az elképzelés és a kivitelezés remek. A hangulattal sincs olyan nagy baj, viszont úgy összességében biztos, hogy ez nem az én játékom. Maradnék a BANG! féle pisztoly párbajoknál.

This is more like it!  A fast paced game that really brings out group fun.  The dynamics it encourages is very enjoyable, the rules were easy to pick up, and pointing a gun at the wife was never more fun!  Sadly, I don't play with a large enough group to justify the purchase otherwise I would own this.

I own both first and second edition, and I have to say the new version takes a good thing and polished down a lot of the rough edges. The "Bang Bang Bang" cards are out, and the Godfather has some new (and interesting!) abilities. Loot also gets a revamp that makes it more fun to split. This game is a great gateway when a party of non-gamers inquires about "what's this stuff on your shelf?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'd like to try it again with more players, or possibly with the Team Spirit expansion. As it stands the gun-pointing is somewhat arbitrary and hollow for me, especially when you have so few bullets.

Prefer to play Dead Last (with the right group) or Tiefe Taschen.

I have both this and the first edition rated the same score, but I like this one better. Eight players, card drafting, and the removal of Bang Bang Bang are all improvements. I preferred the old art but the new art is fine. Even the box is thinner. This is how to do a second edition.

If the idea of pointing foam guns at your family members turns you off, then this isn't a game for you.  If your family is OK taking this as a game, then this is a great game of bluffing and trying to keep people from grabbing your loot!  You will be looking down the barrel of a foam gun, and wondering if your mother would really load it, or is she just bluffing.  Do you have the guts to find out?!

Bought new from bookstore at Potomac Mills.  Wasn't as awesome as I thought it would be after seeing reviews and so many people like the game.  My family didn't like it at all and were not thrilled to play with "guns."  I think I will give it another try with a different game group before deciding to keep it or not.  Ended up selling it on used game wall at FLGS.

RATING: 4.5
2nd edition a.k.a. the wimp edition. 

Here's how it works:

First they removed the tension from the main part of the game which is pointing guns and bluffing. 
- first they added ways to heal oneself in the loot cards. While they also added ways to get more bullets, the effect is the bullets are dispersed and less people die. Because wimps hate player elimination and we can't have this. However more shooting with less killings is that people will instead end up poorer and score less. Mwahahahaha. (lame). 
- then they removed bang-bang-bang cards. Now this streamlines the gameplay a lot. But, it removes a lot of the tension as bang-bang-bangs could trump the normal bangs. Which means distributing damage is simple and assessment of risk so banal, there's no risk anymore. It's pretty obvious when to risk and when to chicken out.
- to underline this point further they also removed the tokens of shame, because even something as benign as loosing money when they chicken out makes the wimps cry. It also removed all the other tension that stayed in the chicken out part of the game. Now the risks are simple and banal and accessing them is simple as well. Unless you have no idea what you're doing it's highly likely you will survive. 

Then they had a stroke of genius. They'll replace the tension from the gun part to the loot collecting part. Bye bye the elegance of 1st edition when there was simply money to be shared in equal parts which totally drove the tension and which rounds people will get more agressive. 
Now the loot has become an euroey exercise of score optimisation and min maxing and set collecting. Yes, away with boring money, well some of it is left, now you can collect diamonds for "the person with most diamonds" bonus! Or collect pictures, like a downtown mexican gangster you never could before - the more you have, the more the worth goes up exponentially. Wheee.

This is idiotic on many levels. Firstly Cash and Guns 1 ed. had some rough edges, but everything was geared into creating tension and risk and psychology. Everything was in the gun part and it was visceral and all about personality. Now tension only comes into play if you care about the winning and if you care about optimising your score and therefore you're motivated to internalise the score matrix and play around it. So it's only tense when the brain geared towards winning filters and information and creates tension ("oh I want to win") as opposed to tension being psychological and visceral ("oh somebody is pointing a gun to me"). In other words - the part the makes the game fun/exciting (guns) is not anymore the part that will win you the game, rather it's the optimisation of set collecting the loot cards which will do this for you. Role cards emphasise this as most of them seem to deal with manipulating loot cards, just few of the older ones still stick to the gun pointing phase and all roles enter play revealed because psychology is scary. 

Can you still have fun with Cash and Guns? Well, yes, it flows faster, it's a bit more bland - if you ignore the winning conditions (otherwise it's quite blander). It's a revenge of the geeks - psychological play must die in favour of "strategic choices". And we can't have people dealing with emotional stress or upset, so no "racists" illustrations, and no dying if possible and less actual tension, nevermind this being a game about pointing pistols to other people's heads. Would you rather focus on collecting art? 

Coming in I expect to hate the new illustrations, but while are bland, they're not blander than the game and they kinda deserve one another. Far far removed from the original's influence, the Reservoir Dogs, it's more of a Tiny Toon Adventures (dripping with executive meddling...).

I feel like the changes from the first edition make the game better. It is frustrating to see people make suboptimal choices letting other people get things they really need. Don't know how I feel about the Godfather role. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There is something morbidly entertaining about waving around a foam gun in the faces of friends. Sure, the game involves a little thought – which sets to collect, when to become the godfather and invoke special abilities, and so on – but really, it's the foam guns which make the game.

I suppose the underlying gameplay of bluff is a little flimsy even for party game standards. Also, the art is bland and I don't quite like how the flow is intermittently broken up by certain special abilities in play. But hey, [i]foam guns[/i]. It's worth putting into the rotation of party games despite being a bit gimmicky.

The second edition of Ca$h 'n Guns takes everything great about the first edition and streamlines it, sups it up and then adds a bit more to the depth.  The one gripe that might have been would have been the removal of the "Bang Bang Bang" cards but I didn't miss it at all.

The game is easy enough to explain and moves along quickly, but I am just not a fan of Munchkin-style cartoonish art.

I wouldn't mind playing a serious looking retheme, but I will pass on the cartoonish version.

This is a lot like the first edition of Cash n Guns so refer there for my thoughts on the game.

There is one major change from what I can tell and it is one I am a fan of.  Instead of having an amount of money that needs to be evenly distributed at the end of each round cards representing different dollar values as well as special rewards such as more bang cards, healing, or taking the Godfather role (first in turn order and the ability to make one player re-target each round) are laid out to be drafted by players still in for that round.

This was a nice change so while it still isn't my favorite party game I like it just a little bit more with these changes.

While I appreciate a number of things about the new edition, I'm not entirely sold on the set-matching loot as opposed to the money splitting of the original.

"Fine for a party game" is basically the backhanded compliment of boardgaming for me, and Cash/Guns 2E only barely achieves that backhanded compliment. The abilities are chaotic, the loot system seems fundamentally broken, and the art is fuuuuuucking Munchkin.

As long as the players involved don't take gun pointing too seriously it is a really good game. It has always went over really well with people new to gaming of many ages. It can be unfortunate if someone gets knocked out early but fortunately there are only 8 rounds so it isn't that big of a deal. There is some strategy but mostly you have to be on peoples good sides and not take too big of an early lead :)

I had played the first version and found it to be very "meh".  The second version makes some improvements by adding more interesting prizes to the pool instead of the money.  It's still not really my cup of tea, but fun if you're in a light, silly mood.  If you're thinking about getting Cash n Guns, make sure to get the 2nd edition.

Fantastic fun party game. We roleplay the character's but be warned some folks meta game this and hold grudges. you have been warned. We play a Russian roulette variant where you don't look at your bang click cards just randomly choose. This works well for folks who don't like the choosing a victim though removes some of the strategy. :)

So far one game went badly and one went very well.  I think this is a good game that can work with most groups.  Emphasize the value in choosing Godfather for future turns to be in your favor for not getting shot and getting 1st dibs in money.  Godfather in 1st game didn't want to be since everyone pointed at him all the time.

Only managed 1 play through but with a group of 8 and had a blast! IMO this is a party game that is best when the booze is flowing or with a group that is more comfortable opening up as the only real 'game' to it is the bluffing elements. No-one in my group commented on / had a problem with pointing foam guns at each other but i can imagine some people could take offence.

Edit - marked this up to an 8 as with every play this game seems to get better and better

I feel like I get worse playing this game the more I play it.  I can get very angry when people target me.  And I am very revengeful when I play this.  It used to be my favorite game, but the rating is slipping.  I got the expansion from Gen Con nonetheless.  I think it's still a very fun party game.  But most of the time, I guess I would rather watch people play.

RATING: 7
I had played the original edition before and didn't really expect anything that different from the second edition. There are a few significant changes that make this a very different game from the original.

First, the way you divvy up the loot is different. No longer does it matter if things can be split evenly. One player acts as the Godfather for each round and starting with that person and going clockwise, you each take a turn grabbing a piece of loot until it's all gone.

Second, there's more to loot than just money. In addition to cash, there's two new types of valuable loot. There ten paintings, which are a set collection mechanism. The more paintings you get the more they pay off and it ramps quickly. You'll probably want to take paintings just to insure no one else gets too many of them. There's also diamonds, which generally don't pay off very much, but whoever ends up with the most diamonds at game end gets a %60K bonus. And there are some bonus goodies mixed in with all the loot. There's additional ammunition clips, each of which gives you another bang card. And there's also first aid kits, which heal all wounds.

Third, there's no bang-bang-bang cards and no penalty markers for chickening out. Although as there are 8 loot cards that come out every turn, chickening out is punishment enough.

Finally, there's the Godfather and his special ability. During the loot gathering phase, a player can choose to grab the Godfather's desk as a piece of loot. Only one player can choose to do that per turn, and it doesn't stop you from later grabbing more loot. On the following round, that person will be the new Godfather. They'll get to grab the first piece of loot but additionally, after guns have been drawn and pointed, they get to tell one of the other players to aim at someone else.

The changes add up to making the game feel significantly different than the original game... and I think make it a better game. My kids had a lot of fun with the game, so I think we'll see it getting played a fair bit. We didn't use the special power cards, so we'll have to see if those add anything useful to the game. I never particularly cared for them in the original game.

RATING: 7
Great party game that involves pointing foam gun at each other. With higher player counts, keeping track if one is bluffing does become harder. Ultimately, the lack of interesting decisions brings down what could have been a really good party game. However, plenty of fun factor and the variable player abilities are cool.

Any game where you get to point foam guns at your friends has to be fun right?  Maybe not, but luckily this one is.  This is one party game where people always get excited the moment I open the box and they see the guns.  The gameplay itself has an interesting combination of bluffing and drafting.  It does feel like a series of standoffs, which is what they were going for I'm sure.  A game and a toy all in one.  Fun stuff.

Para jugar cuando te juntas con un grupo de amigos numeroso en casa, hay pocos jugones y hay muchos cubatas.

Sinceramente no es un juego que jugaría sobrio, para eso hay mejores opciones, pero como juego distendido de cubateo es perfecto, muy divertido, el tema de las pistolitas le flipa la gente, fomenta los piques y lo puedes jugar con cualquiera porque se explica en 5 min.

I love the streamlining that happened for the 2nd edition: Drafting loot cards is much easier to comprehend than splitting a pile of bills (math is hard), the Godfather mechanic is genius in it's simplicity, and the removal of the "Bang Bang Bang" cards make choices easier, if not more tense.

The powers are take-or-leave, but the new ones in the expansions are totally awesome.

fun party game. You point at other players to keep them away from the prey, secretely choosing a "hit" or not. They then have to decide whether to still risk it to take a shot at the prey or not. If they caught you bluffing, they get something, if you weren't they're wounded and can't participate. 
The game has one big problem, a player can feel isolated if he is never "included" (noone points a gun at him)
If so, I think it's not that enjoyable to play.
But all in all a very cool game.

A much improved experience from the 1st edition.  It now has enough to keep me and my prefence for gamier games while I play it all the time with numerous casual groups.  Something for both gamers and casuals to enjoy.  Enough decisions that it still remains interesting and enough diversity of loot with the diamonds + paintings that it doesn't reduce itself into a simple game of gang up on the leader.

I don't know what the differences are between this edition and the previous one, but I'm fairly convinced that playing one will be enough for me to judge both games.  It's too unpredictable for my tastes, and the player elimination aspect of the game is annoying.  It might improve if bailing out at the end of a round would give some small reward, but as it is, you have to be bold to win the game, but being bold means you'll wind up dead.  Meh.

Ca$h 'n Guns is a staple of the social/party game arena. Game play is essentially a recreation of the final scene in Reservoir Dogs, with everyone pulling guns on each other then arguing loudly about who should back down, who isn't afraid to shoot and who is just bluffing for a bigger share of the loot that is laying in the center of the table.

When that gets old, there are a whole pile of roles that can be randomly handed out that give players a special power or condition that can muck with the game's rules. They aren't necessarily balanced, but I don't think they need to be. Since this is a social game, strong roles will tend to be targeted early because the players have direct control of who lives and who dies. In the end, it becomes self balancing. It's debatable whether these optional roles are an improvement over the basic rules or just an unnecessary complication. I suppose it's group dependent, like everything else. Personally, I get burnt out very quickly on social deduction games, particularly when the formula is "yell a lot, then make a random guess". At least the roles can give you a little room to game the system and maybe lay some traps for your opponents. I like them, balanced or not.

Ludovic Maublanc's cheeky social game of bluffing has finally been reprinted. It's taught and  plays easily and is a ton of fun, the only single caution I'd put on this one is to set a minimum age limit for younger ones. It's all well and good for adults to play at pointing guns at one another, but regardless of them being foam, I don't think it's wise to encourage younger ones to be laughing at it without context. No big deal, just be wise about it.

Amazing!  This game always is intense and always ends in laughter.  Definitely gives you the feeling of being in the movie of Reservoir Dogs, and definitely is game that gets ran back multiple times.  One that I love to bring out any chance I get.

I enjoy being mean in games, but only when there is a reason for it. The most common conversation when playing this game is "Why me?!" and "well, I had to pick SOMEONE". More often than not there is no reason to aim at one person over anyone else,  and it isn't fun to be eliminated from the round or even the game for literally no reason at all.

Cash 'n Guns is a really silly party-style game about intimidation, bluffing and sometimes using outright force to put the other players down. It is a ton of fun in a box and is really easy to pick up and play by almost anyone (as long as they don't have some psychological aversion to pointing foam guns at each other).

I like that the second edition supports up to 8 players and I like the changes to the "loot-drafting". People complain about the change in the art style to the more light-hearted talents of Mr. Kovalic. While I do kinda wish they had gone a different direction with the art (mostly because the style has become almost impossible to *not* associate with his very famous work on [i]Munchkin[/i]), honestly, the game is beautiful anyway.

This is an incredibly fun game for anyone who likes to laugh and likes the idea of brow-beating their friends into submission over piles of money and stolen jewels. A game that everyone should play at least once, if not several times more than that.

Having played Ca$h 'n Guns only once before and with three players, I'm so happy that they changed the minimum number of players to 4 (from 3)—with 3 players the game is no fun. However, with 4 it really opens itself up and more players is better (I've played with 6 and 7). 

I like how the game simulates the end of a heist between loosely affiliated criminals with very little scruples and how a well placed bluff or two can push someone out of the round and dodging bullets is more of an accomplishment than earning money.

This game does a good job of filling the same spot that The Resistance sits in, but does it in a non-team environment.

Fun ganging up on suspected leader, plenty of opportunity for bluffing and alliances, good social interaction. This is a great party game and possibly a good filler (though perhaps a little too long for that). Casual and party gamers should both enjoy this.

Great thematic mechanic pointing guns at each other.character powers add some nie variety but some are slightly overpowered.

What I would consider a "party game".

Good for some laughs with friends, if you can deal with the fact that you have a simulated gun pointed at them.
I really fall on neither side of the whole "gun issue", I have just always felt that you do not point a gun at someone unless you intend to use it. Yes I know it is just a foam gun (not real), and I got around my personal issue with pointing it at player marker and not at my friends head. So, no big deal. But it was enough of something that it prompted a conversation about it with everyone playing.

Either way, I am not huge into party games, but it was kind of fun.

Fun to play. No desire to own.

Fun silly party game. Most of the fun comes from pointing guns at others so if that isn't your idea of fun I would look elsewhere. Drafting for loot is quite simple, but games can become quite lopsided if not everyone is paying attention to who's been winning all the loot.

RATING: 6.9
A fun party game. 

Pointing guns at each other can be a little controversial in some groups but if everyone's okay with it then you're bound to have a great time.

My only gripe is the player elimination. A player who feels gutsy and sticks his neck out could be offed while there are still a number of rounds to go. A quick house rule we added was once you took 3 bandages you had to give up a piece of your loot to come back, not exactly balanced, but it keeps it light and fun!

-- Sold: 10/30/16 - They player elimination was too much, stopped bringing this one out.

A great upgrade from the first edition. Still an awesome party game and probably the only Take that game that I love. The addition of the Godfathers' Desk is brilliant (it gives you first pick of loot and you can make one person point their gun at someone else). On top of that there are multiple new ways to invest in points: Diamonds, paintings, still straight money. As well as loot that heals you or gives you bullets back. Then there is the pile of different character abilities. All in all, they fleshed out this game to be so much more than it was.

Was unsure how fun it'd be given how light the game was ranked and seemed to be based on the rules. Playthroughs always seemed fun however, and once buying it and trying it out with a group of friends, it went over a lot better than I thought, and that was without the role cards! I don't think I would ever play this with strangers though - with friends, I can see this virtually always being a blast. Definitely glad I bought it.

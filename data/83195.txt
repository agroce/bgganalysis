RATING: 4.5
I am not the target audience for this game, but I can see it working well with beginners/non-gamers/light gamers and I know some more serious gamers that enjoy it for what it is.  

Essentially it's a reaction game where you grab the correct item displayed/not displayed on a played card.  If you collect the correct item, you gain a card (point) and if you pick the wrong one you lose a card (to the person who chose correctly so potentially they can gain several points in a turn).  Gameplay is quick and simple and reasonably fun and accommodates several players.  This is a game I can see children beating adults at.

Own the [boardgame=118705]Geisteblitz 2.0[/boardgame] and [boardgame=148532]5 vor 12[/boardgame] "expansions".

Jogo muito louco de pegar um de cinco objetos conforme as cartas apresentadas e determinadas regras. Aflitivo, na competição por quem pensa mais rapido!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A perfect, ingenious speed-deduction game. Lovely wooden pieces sit on the table. A card is drawn showing several of those pieces in a variety of colours. Players must attempt to be the first to grab the piece which is not represented on the card, either by image or by colour. It is hard to explain in writing!! Variant rules crank up the difficulty/confusion level and you can even combine the game with the equally good Ghost Blitz 2 to make it even more difficult. The fun in the game comes from the groans of players who thought they'd made a successful grab only to be shown otherwise by the slowed players. You cannot escape making mistakes in this game - the premise is deliberately confusing - and that creates a lot of laughs.

Lightning quick game "spot the difference/what's the same" type game with a slight twist.  Kids will beat you for sure.  Don't play with anyone who has long finger nails!  Ouch!  Lovely pieces and quite fun to play - if you're drunk it would be hard.  Not sure how much replayabililty there is in it, though.

RATING: 8
Flip a card, be the first to determine which of five objects is "right" and grab it.  For example, if the blue book is pictured on the card, it is right.  If nothing blue or a book is pictured, then the blue book is right again.  The latter form of recognition is much the more difficult.  While I imagine this is a great game for kids, I think it also fills that late night finisher slot for adults very well.

The wooden objects are very nicely done.  Card quality is just OK.

Nice dexterity based filler. Like many Zoch games it has beautiful bits.  This would be great for playing with young kids.  It is great for playing with adults late at night when their tired..  In addition to the dexterity aspect you're often guessing using 'negative space', which object is not in this set.

It' might be a little long, but there's no reason why you need to go through all the cards.

A very charming, easy-to-learn, and engaging speed game. For a filler or something to play in a social atmosphere, this is a solid choice.

[UPDATE 7-->5]: Unfortunately, this game lacks a good handicap mechanism, which limits my ability to introduce it to new players. If there was a way to increase the difficultly for one player or another (like in Xalapa), I would rate this game much higher. Despite this, I still enjoy the game and think it is incredibly charming.

Nice reflex tester and mind teaser. The multiple 'totems' up for grabs add a nice touch to the genre. Tons of laugh with big parties, each member struggling to get that tiny little item for him/herself.Also really funny to see how the human brain works during clarity or confusion states and the transition in-between.

A wonderful little game, but I feel it's best played with brand new players.  The best moments for me came when people would make ill-fated knee-jerk reactions to the card and grab the wrong piece, or when everyone would stare at the card for what felt like forever before someone would slowly and gingerly grab the correct piece (this was of course followed by several further seconds of silence, and finally, a collective "Ooooooooh!" from the table). Lots of laughs all around the table and questions of where people could buy their own copies.  With experienced players, the game gets a little too competitive for what it is--if it's just one experienced player, they always win.  If it's all experienced players, then it's a lot of inadvertent hand bashing and scratches.  So, I usually sit out of the game and just dole out cards for the newbies.  I gotta say, though, that the game was way beyond the asking price.  Acquired via Amazon.

Fantasma Blitz, un juego muy divertido. Es como Jungle Speed (con arte más infantil) pero que obliga a pensar y a invertir más tiempo a la hora de coger los tótems.

Geistesblitz is the perfect party (and family) game: it’s easy to teach and learn, can be played in just a handful of minutes and greatly helps both warm a group and make it loud, which improves socialization even when new guys are around. (October 2011)

Can speedy recognition games be fun? Sure, I give Ricochet Robots a ten and enjoy the odd game of Jungle Speed. Even Set and Blink are fun. This game, however, does nothing for me.

Hilarious pattern recognition game that has you grabbing pieces in the middle as fast as you can based on the card revealed, either the object that matches the card or the one object that does not match the card's colors and objects. My 5-year old daughter picked it up quickly even the rule about both objects being colored incorrectly. Our first game she only lost by 2 with my wife helping her only towards the last 15 or so cards. We then played two more times in a row and my wife won both of them. This is a game we all can play and I love it!

Juegazo! Lo probé 1 vez, y instabuy. Un Party Game brutal, parecido al "Mechero" o al "Jungle Speed". Hay que ir con ojo, mujeres con uñas largas abstenerse. Conozco a una persona que terminó en la enfermeria jugando a algo como esto...
Al haber varios "tótems", lo bueno es que es menos probable que haya colisiones múltiples. Pero las hay xD

I am not a fan of speed games. I hate Jungle Spee for instance. But for some reason, Ghost Blitz works for me. Maybe it's the double level of thinking before you grab something and the brain burning, especially in the beginning of a game, when you try to make your brain work according to the rules and rule out colours and shapes. And it has provided some really hilarious moments for my group
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Best speed-deduction/reaction game out there. however, there is a group of people needed that have played the game approximately the same number of times because if there is a huge gap in number of plays there will also be a huge gap in the number of points ;) It gets even better with Geistesblitz 2.0 and the advanced rules.

A pure speed game.   Flip a card, look at it quickly, decide what type it is, and grab the right object as fast as you can.   Repeat 59 more times.

Does not get played as often as I'd like :( so I get my fix via the app. Still a fun game but probably better as a party game with more than 2 players. Deserves its rating of 8.

-------------Original rating 18/10/15 Score:8
[b]Rating based on - 15+ plays, 2 player[/b]
This is the only speed/reaction game in my collection (well together with 2.0 it's two) and I really love it. The two sets can be combined to make a bigger and more complex game. The problem is the other half is not fond of speed games :( 

However, I will keep it because - our collection needs some diversification and this is a category that is under-represented, we don't have anything else like it, the theme is fun and cute, the components are sturdy German made toys, it plays up to 8, the rules can be explained in 2 mins, the gameplay is simple and straightforward, and that makes it perfect for playing with children, small family gatherings or evenings with friends that drop by and don't normally play games. Can see this being more fun with even more players.

Glad I took the plunge on this one! I am a fan of action and dexterity games and this one is quite different from any of the others I have played. It can be quite nasty with more than a few players! They should have included a pair of nail clippers and require players to trim down before playing - cuts and scratches should be expected!  With GB, either you're good at it or you're not. GB is a nice little brain exercise and a fun game to play. Both times it created quite a riot at the table! Any game that is fun to play and creates that much laughter gets a solid thumbs up from me!

RATING: 7
The main difference between this game and other reaction dexterity games is that you're thinking.

Card is turned open and all players are franticly thinking what is the correct thing to take.  And then, because you guess it is the correct thing to take, you grab something.

But you're not 100% sure it's correct.  You're 90% percent sure.  So every card/grab is exciting, since you never know for sure if you grabbed the correct piece.

Good pattern-recognition speed game that is fun if you play with people of similar skill levels.  Children being left behind are likely to walk away or just start grabbing everything.  Could handicap by instituting a delay for faster players.

Great staring-then-grabbing game. I enjoy it the same way I enjoy Set; my friends who really only want to play Set were disappointed, but my friends who (like me) loved Set once upon a time but are kinda done with it... got a big kick out of Ghost Blitz.

Goofy optional rules (like "if any object on the card is red, you have to punch your neighbor on the shoulder before grabbing an item") are highly recommended.

Geistesblitz is a stupid game that you could explain in under a minute. Everyone can instantly be enjoying the game, and it is very exciting.

The intensity of this filler game is unmatched. Let me give you a choice... For the next fifteen minutes, would you rather watch two grand champions at chess, or would you rather watch two slightly drunken friends duke it out? 

Geistesblitz is THE stupid filler game to beat.

RATING: 10
My favorite dexterity game.  Very clever in that the game is designed as a race but the higher level pattern recognition skills you need to win the race often get short circuited by the more visceral reactions and emotions.  Game clearly requires skill and players can improve with incremental plays.  Can be very fun, and also very intense, though best with players of similar skill levels.

Other things I really enjoy about it:
1.  Very simple to teach (~1 min), difficult to master, especially in competitive settings
2.  Flexible in terms of required time for game play - can go anywhere from a few seconds for just a few cards to hours if people are really into it!
3.  Flexible in terms of number of people - you can play with 2 and likely beyond 8 if you can fit everyone in to grab.  You can also play in teams or have a free for all.
4.  Flexible range of ages - I've played with kids as young as 4 and all the way up to senior citizens.  The components are cute and the rules simple, allowing the game to masquerade as a children's game but the gameplay gives it much wider appeal. Great teaching tool for young kids - would also recommend it for educational purposes.
5.  Modular design allowing you to adjust difficulty level through introduce advanced rules and additional sets - I have played with all three sets together (Ghost Blitz, Ghost Blitz 2.0, and Ghost Blitz 5 to 12) and all the advanced rules, resulting in a game where you flip a card and stare at 19 objects to try to figure out what to grab or say before your opponent(s)!

Initial Rating: 6.5 (May 2013)

Very simple and quick pattern recognition game, however I really liked it. It can be explained under a minute and play under 10 minutes (perfect for the family or to attract new gamers to our hobby). The game offers lots of laughs in a very short timeframe, every time I have played this we play at least two games in a row. 

I suck at it but I like it and I want to buy it. Not a game to play every day, but I can see myself playing this from time to time.

What a fun game, I’m upgrading its rating to a provisional 7.0. I bought the game and I plan to always bring it with me to our game gatherings. I`m now officially a fan of Ghost Blitz.

One of 2010 favorites.

After many plays, Ghost Blitz is boring me. I will keep it in my game collection because it is a great game to show new people, but my desire to play it is very low.

Ghost Blitz is no longer among my favorite games of 2010.

RATING: 8
This game is basically identical to Haba's Knapp Daneben (both by Jacques Zeimet).  Having played Knapp Daneben a ton of times, it takes a little bit of getting used to, since there are no more background colors, all colors are integrated into objects on the card.  This led to multiple mistakes for me on the first play.

Ultimately this is probably a little better than Knapp Daneben, because the two human figures looked too similar to new players, and this avoids all such confusion.  There is also a variant included in this game (which could probably also be used with Knapp Daneben) which looks like it might be fun.

Typical party game, which requires good reaction. However, it can be enjoyed most, when all the players are of the same level. This is a good game, but if it is possible, I like to play those, which require more thinking.

Tipiškas vakarėlių žaidimas, kuriame svarbiausia gera reakcija. Kaip ten bebūtų, bet įdomiausia, kai visi žaidėjai bent jau panašaus lygio. Tai geras žaidimas, bet jei galima, aš mieliau žaisčiau tokius, kuriuose reikia daugiau mąstyti.

The dominant strategy is clearly the claw.  Makes the game broken.

Ah, the game I love to hate.  It's a very cleave and superior version of Jungle Speed.  So it's physical reflex/reaction time based with a smart mechanic and solid play.  There's fun to be had with almost any crowd, I'm just terrible at it and hate "wasting time on this while we could be playing real boardgames".  This being said, the game is well designed and undeniably good quality.  Makes a great gift (give people an opportunity to get it our of their system while you are not there =)

The game is very much like Spot It.  You have several multi-colored objects and a card is flipped.  When flipped you see if there is a single item that matches or if all match there is one exception.  

First person to grab the object, gets the card.  Advanced game is if you grab by accident you lose a card.  

I don't like Spot It for Set.

[b]So far, this is my second favourite pattern recognition/speed game. I still like Ligretto best of all, but this is great too. Involves more thinking (is the object shown the right colour and shape, and if not, which colour and shape isn't on the card at all). Great wooden components, cute drawings.[/b]

Easily my favorite pattern recognition game. It's like deeper Jungle Speed even though it's childrens game. Especially with the expansion there are so many rules/exceptions going on that even best players can and often will stumble, evening the ground for worse players. Games like SET don't have that as they are all about the recognition and thus very hardcore, making worse players feel dumb. That's not a problem here. Components are cool too and make the game accessible for children aswell.

2-Player Comment:
* The more the merrier, but Blitz works with any player count. Evenly skilled opponent is recommended.

A card is revealed that contains two of either a ghost, bottle, mouse, book or chair.  There are pieces of each of these objects on the table.  If the pictured objects contain one of the figures as the same color it is on the table then you want to be the first to grab it (the figure, not the card).  The chair is red so if the picture depicts a red chair you would grab it.  If the pictures on the card contains objects of different colors than on the table you want to be the first to grab the figure that is NOT on the card.  This figure will also match the color that is not on the card.

A quick, fun family game that I'll never be that good at.

2-8p, 20min, 1.14/5 [Card Game/Party] 

I think it is a good filler for late night parties, and it is quick to teach. It is, however, not too complex, and once your brain has figured out how to interpret the cards you can have an unfair advantage. 
Next time I'll try the Ghost Shout variant (if a book is in the picture, you shout the name of the item instead of grabbing it) to see if that increases the fun and reduces the skill gap between experienced and new players.

RATING: 7
Fun little reaction/speed game. Flip a card, decipher the meaning, and be the first to grab the correct object. If you do it, you get a card. If you guess wrong, you give a card to the person who guessed correctly. 

The bits are neat. It's fun to grab things and laugh at people when they are too slow or grab the wrong things. It's also very quick and plays a lot of people. Which makes it an ideal game to fit in at family functions. 

I like it. 

Played: 4 times.

I first played this on the iPad but the real thing was better. Ghost Blitz consists of 5 physical wooden pieces that are very nice from an aesthetics point of view. There is a ghost, mouse, book, chair and bottle. Each comes in a different colour and then there are a deck of cards. 

Each turn or round will see 1 card flipped over and the players need to quickly deduce an outcome. Each card will feature 2 images of the 5 objects and 2 colours will also feature. 

If the card depicts one of the five items in the exact same colour as its physical counterpart, then it is a race to grab that object from the center of the table. Doing so will win the player the card to add to their score pile. 

If the 2 objects displayed on the card do not represent one of the physical objects, then the players are trying to deduce which object or colour is not represented and be the first to grab one or the other. Success will also earn the card in question.

If a player grabs an incorrect item then they must pay 1 card from their score pile to the player who wins the round. 

This continues until a certain number of cards are collected by a single player. 

This is a really fun game for such a simple contest. When all the players are at a similar skill level the play is frenetic.

One of the handful of games that I have to work hard at to beat my five-year old in as my old man brain can't process as quickly as hers. :)

EDIT: Much more popular these days with the kids.  Perhaps a bit too young when first introduced.  This is a favorite of the three-year old.  She first removes the pairs (object then color) leaving the correct object.  Good fun.

Unusual party game! Needs more plays...but the dichotomy of people playing this game so far, seems to be those that can get the cards quickly and those that just do not see how it's possible to get those cards that fast. This game is actually not very fun to play and can be aggravating for some. Not a great party game.

This has quickly become my favorite way of livening up the gaming table after a brain-burning, demoralizing Euro. It's a speed/deduction game that keeps Alzheimer's at bay.

When I first saw it I thought it was awful. 

Thankfully I had the chance of playing Jungle speed & Jungle speed safari before I buy any of them, and I found them to be completely boring, annoying and (to my surprise) even complicated.

Geistesblitz, although not very stylish (the ghost itself is pathetic), is everything I expected from a fun and simple speed/dexterity game. I was lucky enough to make the right choice!

Clear and straitforward rules and the cards work great!!!

Be warned and never judge a game just from it's looks!

(Wife's Point of View: She plays with it if I ask her to. She always refers to it as the "kids game". Maybe it is, because only in kids games I try to lose cards on purpose in order to keep my opponent happy.)

I don't think I have won this yet. I have been smoked by the wife and sister every time. Usually both of them end up with 20+ cards while the rest of us sit at 5 or so.

Lots of laughs with this one. The only downside is that new players are going to have a real rough time catching up with people that have played before. It takes some time to internalize the logic required to recognize the appropriate patterns.

RATING: 5
This is a Jungle Speed-style speed/recognition game.  Here, there are a number of tokens to grab in the middle that correspond with pictures on cards.  If one of the two pictures on the card matches the color and shape of a token, the first person to grab that token wins the round.  More often though, neither of the pictures will match exactly, and you need to be the first to grab the token whose color and shape are not represented at all on the card.  I've found that looking for two different possible outcomes really slows down the mental process.  This game really isn't my kind of thing, but it's a neat idea.

Mmm, not sure yet, first casual play and my understanding of the concept helped me process the solution quicker than my 2 opponents (at different ends of the age spectrum), but it's more of a puzzle than it is fun (though this may be due to not playing with penalties). Also agree that 60 cards seems too much to go through, with probably 30 cards being ideal.

RATING: 5
This is a speed game where a player flips a card and then people need to grab the correct object based on what's on the card. The card will depict two things and two colors. If the card exactly pictures one of the miniatures that's the right one. If the card doesn't exactly depict one of the miniatures, you need to grab the mini that doesn't match either the objects or the colors. It takes some brain programing to do well at it, but it's a fun little exercise.

Each card has two of the objects in the center. Either both objects are the wrong color, and you have to grab the item that is neither of the objects or colors on the card, or one of the items is the right color, and you grab that one. My brain doesn't handle that sort of image thinking. Not a bad game, just a game that requires mental acrobats I can't do well.

Ghost Blitz is awesome. It's a speed pattern-recognition game, where you flip cards over and quickly have to determine which of five included wooden objects is depicted on the card: a green bottle, a blue book, a white ghost, a red chair, or a grey mouse. Sounds easy, right? Just look at the two pictures on the card (a mouse sitting on a chair, say) and pick the one that's the correct color. Except most of the cards show two objects that are [i]not[/i] the correct color. And in those cases, you have to determine the object and color that is [i]not[/i] represented on the card. So a blue mouse sitting on a white chair would have the correct answer be "green bottle" since all other objects/colors are represented: the mouse is there, the chair is there, the book is "there" because the color blue is present, and the ghost is also "there" because the color white is on the card. It's actually something of a mindf*ck, especially when everyone starts looking for what's not there, completely missing the obvious grey mouse on the card. I have no idea what kind of longevity this will have, but initial plays have been fantastic. 

Just so I write this down someplace: when we've played this 2p, my son and I sit opposite each other at the coffee table and my daughter joins us, putting herself in charge of flipping the cards over for us. So we're all together to play, despite my daughter not actually playing the game. May these days never end.

The concept is great, in practice - with a group of adults -this felt a bit meh to me. It's always the same person who grabs the thing first. It's just too much brain-twisting for such a casual game. Hard to play with kids because they're just slower than adults, and beware of fingernails!

Update December 2015: I have to revise my old rating. I've tried with the kids again (7 and 10) and this time it worked really well. The oldest was better than all the adults. I would now advise only playing with kids, because their enthusiasm is great to experience.

I enjoy Spot it!, I love Jungle Speed and I was told this was better than both, so when I was in Germany, I immediately bought it. 

And it is very clever. Utterly clever. Instead of pattern recognition in real time, this is real time deduction or speed brain burner. And it's not that hard to grasp, speaking of complexity, so it's both for kids and adults. 

Yet, there's one problem. It's the most intimidating game I've ever seen. It sneers at new players and crushes them. Takes will, persistence and determination to succeed. The problem is what's supposedly the strong point of the game, namely that deduction is simultaneous - all players are involved all the time. Yet this means everyone's always against the best player, and if you played 5 games of this and has thus have internalised the deduction process, you'll obliterate all the newbies. Their spirits will be crushed, their brains frozen and then melted down. 

Compared to Spot it and Jungle Speed I still find Jungle Speed the best of the bunch. It's like this: Spot it is the best filler with no learning curve. Jungle Speed has the most legs as it allows for mastery and learning of skills, but also allows for an environment where one can learn these skills. Ghostblitz lacks the latter - it's best to be played with a closed group over and over.

RATING: 8.5
Filler muy divertido, en el que hay que coger lo más rápido posible uno de los 5 objetos que están sobre la mesa. Se hace más divertido si hay mucho jugadores. Existe una variante del libro, que le dá más dificultad al juego y lo hace más divertido si cabe.

RATING: 7
The set of counter-intuitive visual cues (grab the object whose visual cue is [i]not[/i] depicted on the card) makes this a pretty challenging and thinky game. Another positive aspect about this speed-based game is that it finishes under 15 minutes and doesn't have the potential to drag like Jungle Speed. It doesn't provide the same level of amusement that Jungle Speed does, but that's fine by me.

fun light activity. WAs worried at first that it wouldn't hold up to repeat plays since you'd start to memorize the cards, but after seeing how it works I see that they're so similar that your brain has to process them anyway. Good light fun in the vein of Jungle Speed.

The components are cute

Il fantasma Baldovino infesta il castello. Se ne va in giro con una vecchia e polverosa macchina fotografica e fotografa tutto quello che fa apparire e scomparire …compreso se stesso! Purtroppo, la vecchia macchina fotografica sbaglia tutti i colori. Una bottiglia verde, ad esempio, a volte sembra bianca a volte blu; tanto che Baldovino non ricorda più cosa voleva far sparire. Aiutalo a ricordare gli oggetti giusti o falli scomparire per lui. Un buon colpo d’occhio e uno scatto felino ti assicureranno la vittoria!

Amazing what kind of playing experience you can create with just a pack of cards and 5 items.
By all means, NOT a kids' game. 
It gets quite difficult when you add the variation where you need to tell instead of grab the item in question when the book is pictured on the card.

Children’s game that’s quite engaging. Five chunky wooden pieces, like a blue book or a red chair. Turn a card, then quickest to grab the right object gets the card, anyone grabbing the wrong object loses a card. Different levels of difficulty: some cards show the correct piece (in a group of wrongly-coloured pieces), some cards show multiple pieces wrongly coloured and you have to spot the piece/colour that’s [i]missing[/i]. We combined the cards to maximise difficulty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The perfect light game to play between heavier fare. Doesn't take very long, makes everyone laugh and has a nice, tactile aspect. Doesn't require any strategy, but it is certainly possible to get better at it. You learn to allow your mind to move your hand before you consciously interpret the card that's just flipped. And I like the fact that when you explain the rules everyone looks blankly at you, but when you flip the first card and explain why you won the round, everyone goes 'oh, I get it' and they do.

A decent pattern recognition game with speed and dexterity akin to Jungle Speed.  Great bits, amusing artwork, decent filler over all.  Flaws include issues for colour blind players.  Over all I liked it, the others I played with were not so keen.  Some people are slow with the visual perception and watching them get frustrated takes some fun out of it.  At the end of the day it's how quick you are compared to everyone else.  Great with the right group of competitive players with the required abilities.

Really nice components. Dastardly designed speed matching game where the item usually matching is not shown on the card.

Really fun. The Ghost Shout version is the best way to play.

Update: I've played most of the major speed games out there and for me this is still the best "flip a card, grab something" speed game. The simplicity of the game, plus that subtle twist of grab the thing pictured [i]or[/i] grab the thing that [i]isn't[/i] pictured, keeps this one fun after many plays. The additional layer of the Ghost Shout variant (if a book is in the picture, you shout the name of the item instead of grabbing it) just makes it even better.

First Impression:

A quick reaction game that forces you to think both quickly and in depth.

Thinking in depth makes this a difficult game, and you'll easily make a lot of mistakes each session. The game is quick, skill based and luckless. Grabbing objects is very fun and creates a lot of laugh in the table.

Negative points are used to keep you on your toes (otherwise you'd just grab an object and hope for the best), but make this game inaccessible by tired players who'll usually score just 0. In short, it does not differentiate players based on their skill below a certain skill level. So no, this is not a drinking game. In addition, I can see a lot of players being frustrated by the whole penalty system, which can easily erase their earlier performance. That said, the game is also quite brain burning and demands a lot of concentration for a filler.

All in all this is a fun, if a bit tiring&frustrating filler. Unfortunatelly for it, "Spot It" is similar and much better in every possible way.

Must have for kids 6 and up. Fantastic speed game of deductive reasoning. Get both the original and 2.0, but not the "5 Vor 12" version, which is not as good as combining the first 2 games.

Maybe the best deductive-reasoning speed game. Must have for every classroom, I'd say, and fantastic for building deductive reasoning in small children. Three simple rules, and in about 10 seconds it's easy to deduce that answer, but under time pressure, this is an extremely challenging game. Buy version 2.0 as well and you can combine them both for an even more challenging version. (There is a new version out, but the first two combined are a better deal than the new one.)

Ghost Blitz, along with SET, are must-haves for young kids if you want to them to develop reasoning skills. 

If Ghost Blitz is too intense for you, go for Spot It!, which is also a real-time speed game but a lot easier.

Si la carta tiene un objeto con el color correcto --> Tómalo. Si no --> Toma el objeto que no sale en la carta y cuyo color tampoco está.

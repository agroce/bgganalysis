Picked up the hardened edition at Gencon and I do not regret it all! :) Having the extra types of zombies really adds to the theme and the mechanics.. not to mention the boss zombie is great! Admittedly, I am not a zombie fan, but this game simplifies the zombie management and makes it feel like you have zombies on your tail ready to bite into you without having to micro manage a huge board with irrelevant zombies.  We play this game as a good starter game, whenever game.  Would pull this out with about anyone. If just a little bit more player interaction, this would be a ten. But that said.. Worth it without a doubt.

1 play / 4 players

LIKE: Managing zombies in the different zones is interesting and rolling dice is always fun. The Follower cards are interesting.
DISLIKE: It's boring when it isn't your turn. Some "take that" card effects. No strategy.
OVERALL: Not really my thing. I wish there were less cards and more dice. More interaction as well.

A light fun zombie game I will actually play and enjoy. Run fight or die pretty much says it all. The game involves a party of survivors who are on the run from zombies. Your objective is to manage your "tableu" which scrolls up and is constantly producing zombies that are chasing you. You use dice and a Yahtzee mechanic similar to King of New York/Tokyo to select actions that help you run and or fight zombies and mutants or to explore and recruit new survivors into your party. The goal is to recruit enough survivors to achieve a specific amount of health points. The game does a good job of constantly forcing you to balance running and fighting zombies and surviving with recruiting and building up your resources to win the game. The play isn't exactly competitive because you mainly just try not to die. If anyone dies, the game ends. The most you work together is to deal with the mutant boss when it spawns because it is bad news for everyone if he is allowed to roam from player to player every turn. Well done Grey Fox!

If the guy who suggested playing Run, Fight or Die had called it zombie-themed Yahtzee it would have drawn an immediate veto from me. So I was really quite surprised by how much fun this game was. With a low player count it plays briskly as it needs to. There is plenty of zombie theme, pressure inexorably builds as the hoards keep coming, you can sometimes do bad things to your opponents and the dice do their job.  What more could I ask?

The artwork is quite nice and production quality is good. The rules are poorly organised and repetitive.

I LOVE the Follower Cards, the people you "find" in this game, they have great abilities and are very thematic.

It's just too bad the rest of the game is too damn random and luck-based to be any fun at all. Its nearly impossible to come up with any strategy. 

Your actions - a random die roll, your loot - random draw, your locations - random draw, your everything - random.

Players can run away with a small streak of good luck, while others just get beaten to death by the die rolls, with little to no way to mitigate it.

Worst still there is next to NO player interaction. Watch your friend roll die and make decisions while you wait your turn with nothing to plan or do.

Games can end in a blink of an eye when a player is completely overrun within a few minutes - at that time count up the victory points that you got from drawing randomly in the follower deck and the person with the most points wins - unless they died from zombies.

The components and art are amazing, the production value through the roof, but unfortunately the game itself has no real meat or viable mechanics to it.

It's a shame I wasted money buying the 5/6th player expansion and the additional zombies.

There is a decent chance this is the best dice game I have ever played. I need to play it some more, as the score could definitely go higher. For such a lite game, this does the best job I have seen outside of Dead of Winter of conveying that feel of struggling against endless waves (actually haven't played Zombicide yet). This is really a fantastic little game, and I need to get it to the table more.

Me? I usually die. 
But seriously ... we saw this game on Kickstarter and groaned. Another zombie game? But what we failed to notice was the designer's name. Richard Launius ; the designer of one of our favorite games Arkham Horror. So when we got to Dice Tower Con 2014 and saw that the man himself was running a demo we gave it a shot. And brother is it FUN! This one could be the king of push your luck games. Fight off the zombies as they come in wave after wave after after wave after wave. Plus you run, fight or die depending on the roll of dice. Always a plus as well. Needless to say when we got back to our hotel room that night we ordered a copy online.

Another yahtzee style game "themed" with Zombies.  Did nothing for me.  Of course, the yahtzee thing has not worked for me in other games (e.g. Elder Sign), but I do like King of Tokyo.  If you like these style games you will likely also like this one, but if you don't this one won't convert you.

RATING: 8.6
If you enjoy games like Elder Sign, King of Tokyo or Bang! The Dice Game, then I think it's a given you're going to dig Run, Fight, or Die!, which is like the zombie version of that type of post-Yahtzee gameplay. The artwork is great, the dice are nice, and the mechanics pretty intuitive, since there's quite a bit that throws down with each fist of dice you chuck. I do feel like it's a little cheap that the Co-Op rules & cards are sold separately, as well as the other variable zombie minis, but all in all you get a great package here and a fun time. Probably the 2nd best zombie themed game I've got after Dead of Winter.

Initial Impression: I'm very impressed with the production value in this game. The cardboard is thick and the artwork thematic, although I would sleeve the cards. The gameplay is an interesting tower defense style game with a yatzee mechanism and zombie theme. I believe the event and location cards will keep the experience fresh over repeated plays. My only nitpick with the game is that it's very much a multiplayer solitaire game, with no opponent interaction. Still, an enjoyable experience.

Funny dice game with theme. Yes, it is almost multiplayer solitaire but it keeps you on board on other players` turns because their death will end your game as well.

And there are cards in the game where you can manipulate the inventory of the other players.

A good filler game. Hardest difficulty around 40% chance of winning in SOLO mode. 2 player game suffers a bit as it is a game of survival. With 3+ it is a race for VP's. I play it mostly solo.

The dice in this game are horrid, but you can tell what they are so it's not too bad, but is definitely a ding to the production.

Tense dice roller with the ubiquitous zombie theme.  Another in the vein of King of Tokyo, Yahtzee style, roll, re-roll then re-roll once more if you want type games.

The King of overused mechanic (Yahtzee).

If you think Elder Sign is really a game, love Dragon Rampage, you think Dice Masters is a game and not a toy, you are going to love this thing. Same old rehash mechanics. A set of dice looking for a boardgame. Just so much of this crap you can take. Helps to be a Zombie. Just boring dice rolling with the usually, reroll, this or that rules, yawn.

Didn't think I'd like another dice re-rolling style game but the theme really does it for me so it gets a pass on that compared to other games that use the well-worn gameplay.

Plays longer than King of Tokyo and the decisions are on par but the game is more of an adventure game due to the zombie horde attacking players individually and the random event and location effects.

A glorified Yahtzee with minis and cards, but it is fun. The character cards crack me up and being an old school zombie lover I dig the theme.

Not for everyday (in fact I'd prefer King of Tokyo to this) but it's OK.

Very similar to King of Tokyo and Zombicide. But I think better. You get less interaction, so people who just want to kill other people will like Tokyo better. Killing loads and waves of zombies is pretty fun. It's light, its fun, and its quick. So while it's a lot of luck and light, I still think it is going to be a hit with most people.

I prefer player interaction, and there was virtually none. The Yahtzee aspect of the game is roughly as good as the game Yahtzee, but with two differences: A) You can flee if you have one of your two rerolls remaining, allowing you to roll locked penalty dice (zombies), at the cost of taking a penalty card, which may be pretty bad. B) there is a sixth event die, which can't be rerolled, and is very chaotic (events can be very good or very bad). Followers, which are the main way to win, can also be quite good or quite bad, depending on when you draw them, and what their powers and penalties are. The game is extremely chaotic, and every turn feels like it could be your last. In fact, I would say that is the game's main charm --it captures the senseless chaos that one imagines the zombie apocalypse would entail.  Unfortunately, this doesn't make for a good game, as most of the time you are forced into obvious tactical decisions each turn. You might be able to make a decision, but it's more of an illusion since the results are so chaotic to make it almost irrelevant.

If the game played in 15-20 minutes, the charm might overcome the chaos.  But it's a game that can drag and drag.

Richard made me buy this at the Gencon! Watching the demo in the booth did this game no justice, the demo guy was green and imo did a horrible job at explaining this game. Awesome game, Richard was right! (I did read previews for this game, so I didn't walk into this blind)

I FOUGHT!

on a more serious note; Richard did talk me into the $100 package and it was worth it! Was it needed? No, but the base game has a ton of pay in it, the extras just make it better.

Dice luck and card luck with no real decisions.. Hmm.. is the theme enough to sit and watch a game on rails?

Nice production.  Really thought it would be a "Walking Dead" game I wanted to play.

I don't feel a part of the game at all.  My decisions can be rewarding or penalizing for no real "strategic" reason, so I checked out of it and hoped for it to end quickly.

It didn't, we're done.  Lol

This Yahtzee-style game is bad, because there's no real reason to choose which dice results you want, and re-roll others. If you didn't roll zombies, then everything else is good, and you can't re-roll the zombies anyways. So you take what you rolled and move on. Winning seemed largely determined by which followers you drew, anyways.

-1 for tired zombie theme, of course.

Fun dice game, but if you aren't a fan of luck I'd look elsewhere. We really enjoy it, but you can lose almost instantly if you have a few bad rolls in a row. But, we love chucking dice and this is just meant for fun so it works for us. Also worth noting - it can be a tough one!

Brainless dice chucking. (pun intended)
I did what i could, but in the second round (after 5 min.) i got killed by zombies & the game ended..!!
Someone won because he was the only one who had one survivor.. Any game that can be over in 5 min. due to bad die rolls is not my kind of game.
If you love ameritrash, love dice, love zombies, don't care about strategy & are able to revel in good/bad dice rolls, this is your game. Otherwise stay clear.

This game lacks meaningful decisions and zombies are a worn-out theme. Every thing can come completely unraveled with one bad turn of rolling. I want to rate this a 1, but it IS a functional game, even if it is terrible.

[b]Solitaire Review:[/b]

Dice rolling fun. There always seems like there is something fun to be done with your die results, even though technically, the only significant choice you're making is whether to re-roll your results or not. With that aside, it's pure fun to knock out a row of zombies with a special action, shoot down the mutant boss, hide in the chapel, find some loot at the police station, see what difficult survivors you need to manage, and anticipate how many zombies will be breathing down your neck on the next turn. 

I've never been hugely disappointed or let down by the roll of the die in Run, Fight or Die. There are times when you don't see a survivor or a location for several turns, despite your best efforts. But otherwise the negative events, zombie die results, and event card effects, seem to be manageable, unless you get particularly unlucky. 

I always play with the horde expansion that ups the tension with the different zombie types. 

My only wish is that they had found away to add a tiny bit more strategy. But as it is, it's fun, light and always a blast. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- The table presence is great. 
- You have enough choices to make you feel like you an impact on the game. 
- Special character abilities mix up the game-play a little. 
- I've heard others compare the three zones to the feel of an FPS, and I'd have to agree. 

[b]Cons:[/b] 

- Character combo abilities feel rather useless.
- I think the horde expansion is necessary for a more intense game, but it adds a lot of down time when checking the card for what zombie types will arrive that turn.

I bought the game and GenCon and I absolutely love it! It plays fast, it's easy to pickup and learn, and it is a blast. You will be laughing while you're playing at some of the things written on the cards. It's great for kids (it's not gory or graphic) and my wife loves it! I recommend this game to EVERYONE!

Another very simple zombie game where you run, fight or die. Each player has their own personal board where zombies will move closer every turn as they try to fight them back. Plays relatively quickly and I haven't had any issues of people getting bored as they died quickly while waiting for everyone else to finish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game is beautiful and manages to be similar to games like King of Tokyo, while also being more interesting. I would have to play this more to really solidify my opinion (I only played it once, at this year's Dice Tower Con), but I think this is a game that shouldn't be played with more than 3 or 4 people. It doesn't have a lot of player interaction to keep other players engaged, so the more people the more downtime, the more it dragged. With fewer people, though, the dice rolling was fun and created tension that you actually cared about. The different actions and cards made things very interesting. Worth trying, at least.

Update: I recently got a chance to play this again, and my opinion was both confirmed and improved a bit. I still wouldn't recommend playing it with more than 3 or 4 people, but the various options available to you on a given turn are so broad as to make the game better than a lot of dice games. The different cards add a lot of twists to the game, and one simple player aid can make all the difference between a fiddly AP-fest, and a fun romp.

Beer & Pretzels game with overused mechanic (Yahtzee) and overused theme (Zombies) that is chromed out with piles of zombie minis and art. All hail to the king of kickstarter overproduction: a massive mini that replaces the large mutant cardboard token. Flavor texts are good for a chuckle, well done. From a distance the 'search for followers' icon on the dice look like ovaries...or did I just had a beer too many? 

Be careful not to play with more than four players, as it can easily drag out the game. Also the game could do with more than one action/event-guide aid. With just one, we had to pass it along all the time. All in all, this game is very light and random. Too light and random for my personal taste. Chromed out zombie Yahtzee remains Yahtzee, which is a mechanic I tend to dislike, no matter the amount of chrome added.

I love the Zone aspects of the game, and the followers, especially the balance between high points and flaw, and low points and bonus, and the Fleeing cards, and the Super combo. However, the event dice (which is wildly fluctuating and cannot be rerolled), and the wildly fluctuating quality of cards (a few bad cards in good stacks, and vice versa) make this too much of a luckfest for my tastes. Without the event dice, and with more streamlined decks for locations and events, this would be much more interesting.

This is a fun and light game to play. BEWARE: it can be brutal and sometimes a bit unforgiving (which is the point, I suppose). Because of that, I'm giving it a 7.5, since it's not a game I would want to play all the time.

I've heard it compared to King of Tokyo, but it only shares the dice rolling mechanic. I did not like King of Tokyo, as it's a luck-based, cut throat game. Even though this game is also luck based, you're playing against the game (while still competing with other players). That being said, there's not a ton of player interaction, but it's so fun to see who can hold out the longest/collect enough followers first. It's a refreshing change of pace and a good light game.

For a Dice Game, lets say that it is "ok". For a board game, naahh, very week system at all.
The game plays smooth and rules are pretty solid, but it is always the same thing... roll dice, roll again, get results, kill zombies, survive.

This is the kind of the game that will be the SAME every time you play. Boring.

king of tokyo meets pandemic: the cure meets zombies. it's mindless fun. there's a bit of decision making, but you're pretty much at the mercy of your dice. the theme makes up for the lack of control you have over things and keeps you invested. good solo mode. just a good time, if you're in the mood for some dice chuckin'. zombie minis are pretty rad. got mine painted up! i wish there was a *bit* more you could do to mitigate crappy dice rolls, but that might make the game too easy.

08-07-2014 - Mixed feelings about this one.  I played twice as Dice Tower Con demos.  The first time was really fun and I wanted to play again immediately.  During the second game characters got a lot more cards that changed things in the game and I felt like it just became way too much to keep track of for what the game is, which is a pretty simple dice game.  Perhaps once you know the cards better it gets easier to keep track of.  If so I think this game could be really fun.  As it is though, I'm not chomping at the bit to own it.

My favorite zombie game to date!  This was actually a hoot to play although it is basically just another themed yahtzee game.  The dice actions are cleverly themed and the followers, locations, events, loot, etc blend in well with game mechanics.  The theme of pressure mounting and attempting to survive the zombie horde can become quite palpable.  In my first play, I was able to keep the zombies at bay but one opponent had over 35 zombies in his three zones at one point; and yes, he eventually died to end the game.  I would not bother with the 5-6 player expansion as the downtime would be excessive.

Love Zombie themed games as this is no exception.
has a King of Tokyo / Bang the dice game feel about it as your rolling 6 dice on your turn and using those dice to kill and move the every growing number of of the undead advancing on your board. The dice can also be used to find loot, locations and followers. A variety of player characters to use each having a special ability.
Bought this as one big lot which came with 3 expansions.
Plays in an hour - not sure id play with 5 or 6 though.

Played 15-20 times.

I enjoy playing this with our son, but it´s not a game I will bring out very often if playing with friends. It´s a yahtzee game at heart and thus very multi-solitaire. The random game-length is a problem. We have seen more than one comeback from certain death, with the doomed player clearing zone 1 with 3 Book icons or similar. First few times that´s fun, but it sure can make the game drag. Also, almost every 2-player game has ended in one of us dying and not in the Follower victory condition. It´s one of those games where many of the victories don´t feel very satisfying. Besides, I´m not a fan of the artwork. Still, it´s a game I´ll keep in my collection.

Wow really enjoying this as an alternative to KOT (I like both). No player elimination (game ends) and the fact that the dice have something BAD on one of the faces really make each roll a lot more intense. Cards are fun as well - just think its a well put together game that I'm glad I purchased.

Fun, frantic, and punishing. Inventory management and referencing of cards and rules on every turn can be a bit much when you're in high-pressure situations, which is most of the time. Otherwise it's a thrillfest that has lots of replay value and plays really well solo!

Worst kickstarter campaign I ever backed.  8th Summit really dropped the ball here.  I had to pay extra customs in addition to already high shipping fees.  Cards of the same type have different back colors and different size, even though I backed everything in one go.  Some miniatures that were promissed were not included in the package.  First time I really feel cheated by a kickstarter.

Not crazy about how different dice combos do the same thing - it means there are 25 different possible action outcomes (many redundant) which bogs down desicion making for what should be a straightforward dice chucker. Seems a little cumbersome for a game that often just comes down to luck anyway. Need more plays to see if familiarity helps.

Update: After a few more plays the many choices become more manageable, but I'm still not liking the game as much as I thought I would. For blowing stuff away with shotguns, etc, I prefer Gears Of War (although a much bigger time commitment is necessary.)

Update: Nope. Me no likey.

I want to like this game more, and I'm trying to. I'll need some more plays to be sure about I feel, but for now, it's just so damn punishing. No one has ever come close to winning by gathering some followers and getting out of town. Hell, players only take followers when they're forced to because everyone is struggling so hard against the basic mechanics. I don't dislike difficult games, but there needs to be some way to make progress and win, even if that's rare. The Game, The Grizzled, Robinson Crusoe..... All very hard, but all allow players to learn and progress and win (very rarely). I love those games. I'm just not sure this one will fit with those the same way.

Okay, the shine wore off really quickly on this one. At first I was totally engrossed by the experience, and had that same feeling I had when I first played Arkham Horror. Then I realized that this is essentially a game where you are just trying to not be the first one killed. That's pretty much it. The decisions of this game are essentially the same as in Yahtzee, but too much hinges on whether you survive or not when you have 5+ zombies staring you in the face. If this game had more of an ebb and flow to it, I think it could have some real staying power. As it is, I just feel like I'm rolling dice to remove zombies from my board, and that isn't fun.

This yahtzee mechanic zombie game is loaded with minis and theme without being overly gruesome. It has fun characters and loads of cards, but is very simple overall.

It's simple enough to learn I have my wife playing with me, and she likes it, and she doesn't care much for boardgames.  played several games with some of my game group buds and we had a blast.  Something about looking over at your buds play area and his board is flooded with zombies, and you think you got this, but next thing you know you're flooded with zombies and lost the game.  Good stuff.

This one has been gnawing at me since my first play (pun not intended, but it really is a pretty good pun). It is essentially a solo game with Yahtzee mechanics, but I liked it. The minis help I'm sure and the art, but the game is just logical and I like games that are logical.

I love this game and my family loves this game.  It is not too long (sometimes very short) and easy to learn and play.  My biggest complaint is the lack of clarity on various cards; locations and events.  One example that comes to mind is some things depend on a location being inside or outside, but locations don't really indicate whether they are inside or outside, so you just have to look at the name and picture of the location and determine for yourself how you are going to treat it.

All players have their own personal player board with zombies that draw ever closer to you. There are the ones one step away, two spaces away and three spaces away. Each turn roll the dice and find out what event takes place (could be more zombies...could be a quiet night). Next use the dice to either draw survivor cards, fight the zombies on your board, or worse...add more zombies to your board.

The survivor cards are very funny, some survivors are loud and attract zombies to your location; Others are helpful to your survival. The survivors you save will be your end game victory points...that is...if you survive!

I seem to have the same game over and over again. This one has the best components; King of Tokyo the most direct interaction; VivaJava seems to have the most variety; Elder Signs the most theme; The Hobbit is the most balanced; and Three Little Pigs the lowest barrier to entry.

I must like them all though otherwise I would stop. Age of War next...

RATING: 8
"Light and swingy, but very fun as a co-op (with the expansion). Custom dice and a horde of zombie minis are nice touches."

What I like:
- As a co-op, feels tense and thematic
- Simple mechanisms; not a lot of rules to remember
- Plays pretty quickly (solo 2p learning game took about 60 minutes)
- As a co-op, there are ways for players to help each other out
- Box is not oversized

What I don't like:
- The game really needs more co-op objectives for variability

I don't plan to play this competitively, although it seems like it could be fun that way. As a co-op, I would put the weight around 2.2, comparable to Pandemic.

RATING: 7
This game is built on the roll the dice then reroll twice idea. Similar to King of Tokyo, but since dice can lock on you, it'd even more similar to CV. Based on your rolls, you can get followers that are worth points, and or protect yourself from the cool zombie minis that walk towards your board. The game is fun and has a good sense of humor. I love seeing all the little zombie minis on your player board walking slowly (or sometimes quickly) at your face.

It's perhaps a little random, as what we've seen so far is one player rolls more followers than the others and ends up winning, while one player rolls fewer attack dice and winds up dying. 

Each character also has a super special ability that you need a perfect roll to achieve. Those miracle rolls are rare at best. There are also a few cards here and there that let you send or pull zombies to and from each other player's boards. I like this, and would like to see more of it in the game.

As far as yahtzee variants go, this isn't so bad. I like the theme and tension of the incoming zombie hoard. Things can go south very quickly with very little control and player elimination is kind of dated concept. Still, I could be convinced to try this again.

This is actually OK as zombie games go. Some interesting decisions as to which dice combos you go for, and I like the mechanic of the "follower" cards (where the high point-scoring ones actually give you ongoing disadvantages, while the low-value ones give you benefits). It does though outstay it's welcome a fair bit, and it feels like there are too many different types of cards for a relatively simple game. In short, this could have been a good design, but they overcomplicated it for no reason. It's still OK, but I'd never choose to play this.

Fun game, even though I was hoping for it to be even better. It does a nice job of keeping the tension high as every turn can go badly enough to end the game or go well enough to put someone new in the lead. My biggest complaint is that with the full 4 players, I feel it drags a bit, which is unfortunate because the fast pace is a big part of it's appeal.

Eh. I think the strategy we missed is to risk a reroll when you have only one Search icon to get a second one to gain a Follower (which you need to win the game). Otherwise, it's a bad zombie movie where you're going from one place to another, resulting in monotonous play.

Incredibly light and quick game that is a bit reminiscent of King of Tokyo both in mechanics and weight. It just feels like it's in the same wheelhouse. The game is highly random and highly swingy, and that can produce some bouts of frustration, but also some incredible fun. I really like this one.

I hate the fact that it only includes one player aid, that the boss zombie is some cheap little piece of cardboard (shouldve been included), and some of the cards have no artwork, just some generic bland looking text.

I like this as a fun dice game.  You can't really control a ton of what goes on in this game, but such is life with these types of games (you can't take them too seriously).  Even still, in only a few games this game has brought a ton of "ha ha" or "no way how did you pull that off" moments.  That's what I enjoy.

The only thing I didn't like is that the game has a huge swing in time variations from game-to-game.  I've had a game last a really long time which is not that fun in something this light.

I just did not get this game at all. I got the rules and mechanics, certainly, but if I wanted to play a game with almost zero player-to-player interaction, I'd go play Civilization V on the computer.
I seriously feel like I've played iOS games with deeper playing mechanics than this.
Someone told me that there was a solo version of the game, which blew my mind, because the way it played, it feels like that would be the main way to play it.
Again, almost zero player-to-player interaction. That's what I thrive on, so I couldn't be less interested in this game.

A game about ever meandering hordes of zombies. Stopping to meander only when fresh meat's on the menu. Which is when you come into play. The game really transports the zombie theme well, because the hordes of zombies never cease to stumble towards your way. Mechanically this game borrows a lot of elements from Roll through the ages but in contrast to that game you don't build up. Not even close! Here all you do is struggle to see the light of another day. Again this sinister world with all its archetypally characters/places/behaviours is fantastically captured within the games' artwork and mechanisms (some really cool ideas here, particularly within the deck of followers). This game screams fun! However, there's a downside to it. After just one game we went through all Event and location
cards, so basically I've seen everything there is to the game after just one game (not talking expansions here). A little more variability would have been nice.

First off,  let me dispense with one very important disclaimer that I promise not to mention again.  I am rating this game without using the mutant in play.  As written, the inclusion of the mutant destroys this game, turning it into a win by attrition. Forget about what dice to lock,  collecting followers - in fact forget about everything else - most likely the game. as you knew it, is over.  Including it in the game,  is not an option for me - in such a case,  I recommend you take a pass on this game.

With that out of the way,  Run, Fight or Die is a fantastically produced game of zombie survival. All of the components are top notch - the chunky dice,  the zombie minis,  the follower cards,  the highly functional player boards - this effort is impressive in every manner.

This is not just chrome for chrome's sake either.  The use of minis are vital in creating a visually bleak outlook concerning the task you are about to undertake - and in that respect,   they serve their purpose well.  The follower cards are littered with various abilities - and while they may be a bit swingy at times - they fit perfectly within the theme of the game.

Often,  there is little player interaction -  that may be an issue of concern with some,  but turns are relatively short and it has never been an issue in any group that I've played this with.  Concerning player counts,  I think 3 is the absolute sweet spot here,  with 4 being the next best thing.

So I highly recommend this game  - with that one caveat that I promised I wouldn't mention again. It is always an exhilarating experience filled with frantic moments and edge of your seat excitement.

I had the pleasure of playing Run, Fight or Die! With Richard Launius and my kids at Gnomecon this past weekend. I was also able to play Zombicide for the first time.

While Zombicide was more fun than I expected, Run, Fight, or Die was an absolute blast. It was about as light as Zombicide, but played faster. There is no time spent determining where zombies need to be moved as their movement is very simple, they move in a straight line toward you! Always! Since every player has their own player board on which zombies attack, the game moves exceptionaly quick and you have a constant tension and "Oh, my God, I'm not going to survive this!" feeling. This is exactly what a zombie game should provide! The real differentiator in my view, and a real plus, is the absence of all the unfun, time burners prevalent in the genre. Setup time and movement is either really streamlined or removed, resulting in uncluttered fun.

The comedic elements of the game had me laughing out loud multiple times. I suppose it's more Sean Of The Dead than Dawn Of The Dead. A raucous good time all around!

The cards and dice seemed exceptionally balanced and I never felt robbed or upset at the results they revealed. All the elements contributed to crafting a true zombie apocalypse experience that was quick, frenetic, and fun. Lots of great memories were created by this game for us, and my kids are asking when we can have our own copy.

Hopefully soon.

What a great thematic game!. I'm kind of over the zombie theme, but I'm glad I didn't pass on this one.  The dice are big and chunky with easy to read symbols.  The art is excellent throughout, though I feel the miniature sculpts don't quite match the art style of the player boards as they are less cartoony.  The back stories for the players are a nice touch.  I like that they made the game play so adaptable.  You can make the game as hard as you want and with the expansions you can add more variety and even play co-op.  The Yahtzee mechanism is nothing new, but how it is incorporated with the addition of card play, special powers, and the spacial play with the shambling hoards comes off as very fresh.  The tension this all creates makes the game memorable.

Have played the solo campaign many times since receiving, and have enjoyed the game. Simple push your luck at its core, but a variety of loot, event, followers, zombies (with the expansion) and locations add fresh twists to each match. 

Clever zombie horde mechanic, a variety of zombie sculpts and eye catching visuals add to the fun mood as you hunt down followers and travel from location to location trying to escape town safely. Would recommend to friends/family.

Rulebook could use another editing pass and a reprint, as its information is scattered and too vague in places and outright incorrect in others (Nurse die result is incorrect for example). 

Miniatures are good overall, but are fairly soft, leading to some bent stances along the bases. The special edition mutant boss also didn't hold his deck, as originally advertised.

Very fun, light game, easy to teach/learn. Of course luck plays a big role due to the luck of the dice. However it is a very thematic game and you almost feel the zombies getting nearer to your character (I usually do not like the zombie theme, but in this case it is a blast!). Interaction depends on what cards that comes into play, but it is there however. I highly recommend this game!

The dice rolling and zombie movement on your player board is a cool concept. Felt like Martian Dice++. However, the characters felt severely unbalanced, I didn't enjoy the artwork and the cards felt too cumbersome for what little they added.

Fun enough, but zombies are totally played out.  Also, RFD! isn't better than top-tier dice games such as King of Tokyo, Risk Express/Age of War, and Elder Sign, so why not play those instead?  

Note: One characteristic of the 'tier' games listed above is that they have significant player interaction. RFD! has zero.  Even Yahtzee outgrew its non-interactive limitations with Yahtzee Free-For-All, which was a nice improvement over the original.

I'd play RFD! again without complaints, but wouldn't suggest it myself.

Good medium filler that works better in solitaire mode. Lots of minis and easy mechanics. The sensation of the zombie horde aproaching to you is one of the most acomplished. Very thematic and fun.

It's a decent quick game that can play up to 6 with the expansion and doesn't require things like access to the game board or lots of reading. The downtime can be a bit on the long side for such a short game though.

Fun solitaire and with others. I've only won once, so far.
Painted Minis. Also the big box expansion.

Minis are a little sticky/tacky.

A fun dice game, but a bit slow and with more luck than strategy or tactics. Still, the game leads to a lot of laughs, with all the fun cards and happenings in the game.

Playing Run, Fight, or Die! is a great time. The game is full of fun moments, stand-up dice rolls, moans and groans. I highly recommend it to people that are fans of interesting Yahtzee variants.

At least it's over in a hurry. Not much to the gameplay, kill a few zombies, grab a few points, wait for someone to die.

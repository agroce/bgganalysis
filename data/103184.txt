GAME: The Gnomes of Zavandor
RANK: 3241
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There may well be other ways to approach the game which we have ignored but first play suggested it was a procession that consisted of buy the cheapest gem; wait until it goes up in price; sell it; buy gems needed for mining rights or jewels/artefacts. OF course this is the essence of any stock market game but while it worked well here, I was after something a little more inspiring
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really like these sort of games. It has a lot of what I love in Hab und Gut, but throws a whole load of other stuff I love into the mix too - the engine-building stuff. It makes an excellent pairing with The Mines of Zavandor - they look great on the shelf together - but more significantly, it takes the economic engine aspects of that game, and puts a new twist on it. I enjoy the familiarity without feeling like it's simply a re-run. I also like finding games which no-one is talking about, and promoting them to friends in the real world, and online.

RATING: 5
I really do not know what to think. Maybe we played something wrong, but it felt like you were taking really really small steps every turn. It felt like making no progress at all.

I admit that we didn't follow the strategy tips given in the rulebook which says that you should go for the mining rights at the beginning. Should this be the case, the game is scripted which is not a good thing for you should be given the choice in which order you build your engine.

The conclusion is that given a choice I won't be playing again but you still do not have to bribe me to stay at the table.

Has some interesting mechanics but can feel a bit luck driven depending on which gems you get. Doesn't really feel like I do anything different each time I play this, just try and execute the same thing over and over.

RATING: N/A
1st play: We misplayed a few rules but enjoyed this market simulator.  In the early game, everything is super tight, and it's a struggle to make any money at all.  By the end of the game, the market was swinging wildly up and down because we played to too many victory points and past the natural end point of the game.  I spent the majority of the game building an engine, and by the time the engine was running the game was over.  

2nd play: The game was much better this time, with 3.  Also, being our second play, we were able to manage and speculate on the market more.  Playing to the correct end point meant the market stayed higher.  I think we would have bought more mining rights, but the gnome got stuck so no one bought any more rights and there was a huge rush on jewelry.  I think it might make more sense if the gnome moved automatically instead of only sometimes.  Kudos to this game for a working stock market mechanic with 2.  A good game but not quite good enough to stand out.

Hard to envision what sort of economy they were trying to model here, but it doesn't seem to work. The inflationary boost of purchasing an item or mining right doesn't seem ti have an adequate counterbalance and the prices quickly hit the roof leaving nothing to differentiate the gem types. Have a hard time imagining myself wanting to play this again.

First mines, now this - I guess Scepter really was a one off.

RATING: 8
I rather like this one. Like Mines of Zavandor, it's not a top-tier game, but it's clever and different. The market mechanism for pricing gems actually works quite well, and it's one of the more successful games using that idea. It's not that long, and plays quite well with 3 (which might be the recommended number of players). I do strongly recommend the "optional" rule for reducing prices on Artifacts which I suspect are optional because they add a slightly fiddly level of complexity - but on balance it seems like the game needs it, otherwise the artifacts are just a bit too pricey.

The "extra action" artifacts are pretty strong. You should get one if you can :)

I quite enjoyed this one, and put it on a par with the Mines of Zavandor. This game has an interesting mechanic in that you are trying to dig for gems each round in a specific prospecting area, based on where the travelling gnome is at any point in time. It has a small element of press your luck in that you don't know what you are about to mine (although you can pay to look before you do it). Personally I preferred to save the cash and just dig. You then mine for gems in the areas you have prospected and buy and sell them back into an ever changing market. You score by getting more mines and buying jewellery and other equipment with your gems. First to twenty points wins.

Not bad! Feels a bit different from previous Zavandors, in that money is money and gems are gems. No randomness in the cards for those. There's a nice market for gem prices. The randomness comes from having face down "mining rights" tiles, which you can pay a nominal fee to peek at. Thing is, though, that you usually are only in a position to buy one of the tiles at a time anyway, so, in our game at least, most players just took a crap shoot. On my next play, I'm inclined to simply play with all the mining rights tiles face up. It might make for a more "serious" game, but I suspect it will be better. We'll see.

I don't think I can rate this much higher than a 5.  It is really slow going early on as gems skyrocket in price.  It's even possible to really hamstring your economy and eliminate yourself in the first couple of turns.  Later, once you develop income from tiles the prices start to fall and the game goes 0 to 60 very quickly. It becomes a mad rush to get the best jewels.  This is further complicated because in a 4 player game I think the best move is to "store" the "1" jewel not on display (that awards 6 or 5 points).  A 6 point play is huge in the late game as the 1st player to 16 points wins.  Thus this ends up stressing the importance on being the start player on turn 1...which is randomly chosen.

Fun art. Quality production. Best first player marker of any game I own. The stock market is neat. I enjoyed the game, but nothing about the gameplay really grabbed me. Maybe I wasn't playing very well, but I felt like the "take 4 gold from the bank" action was too often my best move. I didn't really get much sense of theme from the gameplay, and it seemed a bit fiddly. Not at the top of my list of games I want to play again, but if someone else wanted to play it, I would be glad to join in.

Boring resource conversion game with some engine building and a not very well working stock market.

Not the most beautiful game I've seen (the cards are fine, though), but it's still a pretty cool "little" game. The only downside I found is the luck of the draw when new cards come in, which isn't a big deal usually. Away from that, you have enough options to think about and even more things to count. :P

Plays well and feels like a fun game, rather than a dry stock-market game to me.

Quite a weird game, this one.  Money is very tight, and you'll find it hard to buy the gems you need to trade for the VP cards, but this is good as it puts more emphasis on the mining tiles which seem to reward planning.  The 3 actions per round never seem like quite enough, and it can be quite agonising to work out what to do each round to maximise profits, but that's the point I suppose.  I don't much like the Artifacts (basically, player powers) that can be bought, but they add some flavour to proceedings.

Not a great game, but one which I might keep because I don't have anything else like it.

If it weren't for the oversized largest starting player marker ever (a cardboard gnome about 10cm high) there wouldn't be anything remarkable about this game. I can't imagine who needs this game other than a Zavandor completist. The market mechanism isn't that interesting, the engine building is almost broken with one extremely powerful artifact forcing other players to pay the owner for each digged gem, the set building is lacklustre and the art is drab. I rather invest 30-60 minutes more and play either Planet Steam for a similar but better developed market mechanism or Sceptre of Zavandor for a similar-themed economic engine.

I love stock market games where the market is fully controlled by the player (versus things like Black Friday or Buy Low/Sell High). This one isn't as good as Planet Steam, but does provide a similar offering in half the time. 

Update: Raised rating higher. I'm absolutely amazed by this little known game. It's a player controlled stock market game that works with two AND plays in about an hour. I wouldn't have believed either one of those was possible a few months ago.

I don't know what the punishment should be, for making a complex game and NOT including a quick reference action choice summary and turn order card ... but it should be harsh!

Because the above is missing, our first game of this was so difficult, so full of mistakes and felt so much like work, that we may actually never get to play it again. And that's not fair at all to the hard work done by the author.

Good materials & artwork, btw!

We are really loving this one. Nice to have a game with an active market that still works well with two. Games with 4 also work well. I was afraid it would get a little samey with limited mine tiles, but so far each game has been different enough to be interesting as we learn to use the special cards more each time. We did remove the Hoovermatic because it seemed over powered and too aggressive for our preferred play style.

The Gnomes of Zavandor is [i]yet another[/i] "engine-building" resource conversion game, this time featuring gems, money, and actions as the resources you're converting into Victory Points. The whole "commodity speculation" component is pretty weak, as the gem values don't fluctuate that much. Mostly it's about getting the right combination of gems at the right time, so you can improve your "engine," which in turn gives you more gems/actions/money so you can do the same thing all over again. Once you realize that each round you'll either get something good or be shafted based on turn order, the decisions aren't that hard. I'll admit to making plenty of mistakes in my first play, but somehow I managed to finish only two points behind the game guru who taught us how to play. This probably has something to do with the ridiculous amounts of luck involved in taking the hidden tiles (I was the only player who lucked into one of each gem.) as well as a card randomly appearing that someone just happens to have the right gems for: that only has to happen once for the game to be basically handed to the lucky player. Anyway, I really was not into this game, though it managed not to sink to the depths of "loathing." Definitely a "left me cold" title.

I might consider playing again (and thus be forced to increase my rating) if we played with the tiles face up. Only then could this lay any claim whatsoever to being a "brain burner."

UPDATE: I obligingly played this again and solidified my opinion that this game does nothing for me. I'm not even interested in trying with the tiles face up anymore, so the rating sticks.

An interesting economic game - and one that I still need to play a few times to figure out. The stock-market mechanic is broadly fun adn innovative, though it does occasionally get stuck in a bust towards the end of the game once people've got their engines going.

It could be our group plays too long in the 'engine building' step, and needs to move quickly onto the 'treasure' step, but we'll figure it out eventually.

RATING: 7.5
I love [b]The Mines Of Zavandor[/b] so I eagerly anticipated playing this game. The game certainly has a similar flavor - engine building, collect resources to buy both upgrades as well as more mines - but lacks some of the elegance of the former title.

The rules are more finicky but once you get into the flow of the gameplay it becomes manageable. You always have plenty options on your turn and many paths to acquire victory points. It's a rather fun game for 4/5 of the time...

However, my major cause for concern is that the end-game is just a spending-spree. Gems are difficult to acquire for the majority of the game, but once players finally manage to collect multiple mining cards then they both will receive multiple gems while driving the prices of the said gems downwards. As a result, the game turns into an entirely different game - who can out spend the other in the final round to purchase jewelry... then the game ends.

I will play it a few more times to see if this was a result of our poor playing or if that's just how game works...

I'm wondering if the market prices would have been any less broken if I had remembered the rules correctly and produced as many gems as I could, but I doubt it. The get-money-whenever-anyone-produces-anything artifact seems severely underpriced, and the rest is just a bit unbalanced. (Well, if you really want to call all prices staying at the maximum for most of the game only "a bit" unbalanced.)

RATING: 7.1
A light-hearted and playful take on a market simulation game. Theme nicely complements the mechanisms and ques players that this is not going to be the typical cutthroat market game. Gem market responds predictably to supply and demand, making you feel like a stock market wiz. While you might be able to anticipate shifts, the game is by no means overly deterministic. The placement of mines (gem production), artifacts (special abilities), and jewellery (point scoring opportunities) all vary and create interesting new decision possibilities depending on when they come up. The game play can feel a bit choppy at times, particularly due to the lack of player aids. Can outstay its welcome depending on how players prioritize mine building vs point scoring. Overall, a fun game that fills the economic sim niche for us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like it.  It is quick and dirty, with lots of fun bits to manipulate.  But I think that there is a distinct poor stay poor problem exacerbated by the Hoovermatic which can effectively eliminate a player if they don't have money or access to money.  I think in order for that card to not totally hump the guy in last place it needs to at least let you get one gem for free, then have you start to pay for the second.

Also, this game requires a player aid.  Fortunately, there was one made as a promo card.

On the easier side to learn and does feel tense, but I have a couple issues.  First, the stock market aspect could be highly interesting, but instead seemingly goes up almost every round.  More importantly, though, it's too common to take the default $4 from the bank.  Maybe with some rules tweaks it would rate higher.

RATING: 5
A quick and dirty economic game.  Very, very dirty.  I feel like the Zavandor games (of which I've played 2 of 3) just strip too much away from games to make them light and accessible.  What's left is certainly both those things but is often not very interesting or fun either.

This game is an economic trading game with a stock market mechanic driving the prices of gems based on, you guessed it, the amount bought and sold on a turn.  That's pretty much it, there are some artifacts and stuff with special effects but they are too small a part of the game to really vary it up.  This makes the game kind of bland and probably pretty solvable.

I would always rather play something like Power Grid that hits just the right notes of accessibility and depth.

The game that flew under the radar

Great pedigree (designer also has 'Vor Dem Wind' to his credit)

This is a very good market manipulation and goods conversion game. Not much original but the parts work together very well, with lots of subtle apporaches to victory available - the market works very well and theres real opportunities to manipulate it for gain both long and short.Its nicely produced with the largest start player marker I have ever seen. Given the mechanics this might have sold better without the fantasy theme (Industrial revolution springs to mind) - however its a worthy tocrch bearer for the Zavandor series.

The game has a very well balanced market mechanism!!!

The theme may not look very appropriate in the beginning.
The handling of the price adjustment is a little bit heavy-handed, but its result is brilliant !

In my opinion: A very great game !!!

Keeping track of the market can be a bit fiddly, but the mechanisms surrounding it are brilliant. Getting an engine going and getting combos down in this game is very, very fun, and I like it better than a number of others, hence a 9. I'd play it any time.

Most of the Gnomes of Zavandor works well, and the idea of gnomes supplementing their own mines with gems they buy and sell is charming.  But the stock market is hyperactive.  Prices change based on inventory, not just sales.  This sensitivity would be useful with 2 players but there are so many adjustments that it becomes burdensome with more.   Prices sail all over the place, players end up selecting $4 default actions too often, and the game drags on too long.  This market is a precision instrument that calls for a better game to attach itself to.

Some interesting ideas here (and a hell of a first player marker), but a bit too plodding and staid to merit keeping.

This is a fun economy game. Not good enough yet to where I feel that I have a real strategy other than, "Lets see what happens it I do this..."

Not a bad game, but a little run-of-the-mill.  Mines of Zavandor is a superior game.

A strange little beast.  Looks and feels like a light euro, but has a truly nasty market mechanic which makes it much more mathy and difficult.  Creating mines is a viable technique, but it also can be a viable technique to time the investment and divestment of gems and sell them at a huge margin, and then purchase the gems you need.  This kind of play is quite interesting, but it feels a bit unfinished and mismatched with the game's other traits.  The game is quite short, clocking in at around an hour, even with new players, and the market is not very volatile.  These two attributes combine to make the play-the-market approach feel a bit staid and incomplete.

Market-based games aren't really my thing, but from the ones I've played, I'd suggest [gameid=32666] over this one if you're willing to stomach the longer playtime and drier art style.

Fantasy based economic sim as gnome artisans doing what gnomes do. Deftly play the gem market, obtain mining rights from the wandering agent, mine your claims, make jewelries, and build clockwork gadgets to facilitate enterprise. This game certainly captures the theme and essence of gnomes. The market is quite volatile, some of the mechanics are a bit clunky or easy to forget but overall decent. Easy to remember this game for its gigantic, stand-up, gnome first player cutout.

Nothing special here but a solid game. You try to outwit your opponents and grab the best jewels without having to fight over them.

This is surprisingly involving.  After the explanation, I was a bit skeptical but as we played I discovered there's some real depth here.  There might be a heavy luck factor late in the game once you start "going for the win" but it wasn't overt in our play.

I would caution that in spite of the "cutesy" theme of gnomes, this is something of a brain-burner and could be problematic with AP-prone players.

I didn't think I was going to rate this one, but August was a very slow month, so I'll rate it.

Partially, I wonder if the newspapers we got ruined the game, but this felt like a stripped down version of race for the galaxy, without any of the beautiful art and no real choices to make. It's a rival for Sentinels of the Multivers for me.

I thought the inventions were SLIGHTLY funny, but saw so few of them in the game that I can't really even give this game that credit. I am willing to play this game one more time, just because I think every game deserves 2 chances, but I don't think the rating will change much.

Really enjoy this game. I have found it to be a good gateway because it's fairly quick, easy to explain, has an obvious basic strategy, simultaneous action keeps everyone involved at all times and curiosity about what other twists there are provides easy incentive to play again.  I must admit it is a bit on the simplistic side though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A completely vacuous game with not a single interesting decision.  Draw an invention card, earn the money to place it, place it.  Which is a shame because the mad inventor theme is engaging and the artwork is very nicely done in a fifties cartoon sort of style.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Some good ideas, and I like the variety in the Twist cards. But seems far too random for me: you only draw one blueprint in the research action-- no choice to be made-- so if you draw some high-scoring cards you are likely to get to 20pts before anyone else. There really needs to be more to the "getting blueprints" part of the game.

We are big fans of Vaccarino's games that aren't Dominion. Kingdom Builder is a fun game and yes it is abstract but it never claims to be anything else. Temporum is also a very well designed game with easy game play and good art. So anytime people say that one of his games is bad we tend to scoff. So since everyone said Nefarious was awful we decdided to give this a try especially with a new edition. But in this case everyone is right. This game is awful. It is just what Tom Vasel proclaimed it to. "An economic boring snooze fest." The game play is so simple as to be downright childish. You just do one thing this turn, then pretty much the same thing next turn. Cobble that together with this edition's terrible components (player board that are printed on thin card stock and cards that were so thin I had to actually be constantly mindful of how I was handling them because the slightest crease would bend the bloody things) and this is a really bad game.

RATING: 5
over all this game seems fairly straight forward.  There's a few difficult rules to get the hang of: especially the timing of how events go off.  That part is a little stange.

I like the twists which, (in what appears to be classic Vaccarino style) add a lot ovariety from oen game to another.

I'm not sure that the gameplay is deep enough to keep me coming back for more, and the timing rules make it a littel too inaccesable to new players.

Raiting on hold.  There's potential here but lets see how it holds up to more plays. 

*Update*
There's nothing really wrong with this game (except for maybe the price).  I do think that for such a light filler there are some difficult rules that are not intuitive -- especially for new or non-gamers.  The whole timing of how events work is a little clunky.

I think it's a fun little filler that's clearly gunning for the sort of 7 Wonders feel of a fast playing version of other more meaty games.

Not a heavy game.  Played with 3 and took 3/4 hr because we tied at winning conditions.  Other 2 said they probably wouldn't buy game for collections because they had enough other medium light games but they would not pass up a play if it hits a table.  So I guess I am going to be the buyer. I have so many heavy games and need some medium light fillers.

RATING: 6
Rating after 2 plays. I think the main mechanics of the game are kinda boring. Take money, take money and a card, play a card, or "speculate." The interesting parts, the card effects, only happen every so often, when a card gets played, and then they are just one time effects. (Draw a card, discard a card, get a minion, get some money, etc.) I think what I would have liked to have seen were permanent abilities attached to the cards. That would make the game arc flow differently. I'm sure this was considered, but not done for some reason. Maybe it doesn't work, or it would get too complicated. Not sure. 

I really do like the twists, though. They really do make the game play differently from game to game, at least in the ones I played in. And the art and titles of the inventions are hilarious.

Nice DXV game.  I like it but feel that it is a bit more luck based than I would prefer.  Right now it seems very much that regardless of the twist cards a player with multiple inexpensive, but resource efficient cards in his opening hand has a distinct advantage.  That being said I do seem to be getting slowly better at playing the less "optimal" hands.  So maybe I just need a lot more practice.

Nefarious is a bit of an odd duck in that the base system really isn't all that exciting.  There is a standard set of actions that you secretly choose from and execute each round until one player scores enough points to win.  Pretty bare bones and basic.

However, the genius is that there are 2 "twist" cards played per game which slightly tweak the rules in very interesting ways that make the game very different in feel from game to game!  There are a ton of twist cards provided with the game, so the various possible combinations are huge, making each game anywhere from slightly to extremely different in feel from the previous game.

Without the twists, this game would be a solid "4" rating, but the twists really make all the difference and make you want to see how the various twists affect the game.

Overall, a pretty light beer-and-pretzels weight game, with the "twist" gimmick that makes me want to play more than just one game.

Looks fun, although I will probably be compelled to find other "minion" meeples as opposed to the spina bifida/kyphosis design proposed. You'd think evil geniuses would find a way to have minions that are a little less conspicuous!

Maybe something like the laser-cut transparent awesome counters of Richard Jones (High Frontier outposts replacements: http://www.wix.com/peacefulpebble/gamebits#!high-frontier.) Sufficiently high-tech, art deco-mod while also being delightfully generic.

RATING: 6
Like Dominion and Kingdom Builder, this game is all about judging the random set-up elements (in this case, the two twists), and figuring out how you need to play this game in order to win.

This game is much lighter than those two, and played quickly, the beginning and mid-game are quite enjoyable.

The end-game, unfortunately, is anti-climactic. Someone gets to 20 points on their turn and announces that they've won. Yay?

There's little point to paying attention to what anyone else is doing as there is no way to predict what they'll be doing next. You will occasionally ask how many cards or money people have, to know whether now is a good time to play a card that will make them discard those resources, but other than that, you don't much care what they are doing.

So the announcement that someone's won doesn't have much to it. we've noticed you had a bunch of points, but there was nothing we could do about it, and now you've won. You played a card, which we could do nothing to prevent, and you've won. Not very exciting.

Hmm... that's a lot of words to say that the game has no arc.

As for the components. The board is high quality. The cards are paper thin and I was worried that they were going to disintegrate in my hands while playing. The coins are covered in a vinyl like substance that doesn't punch out well so the coins are all ragged looking.

RATING: 5
An EXTREMELY simplified action selection game.  The only things you do are make money, then draw and play inventions that you buy with that money.  There are a couple ways to make money, but they're not very interesting, and there are also a variety of different inventions, but they too don't do very much.  It feels like they had to force variety into this game by giving it a lot of different inventions, and also by adding the different game "twists" that add slightly different rules to the game.  Unfortunately, it doesn't add much to the rather uninteresting base game.  There are few complexities, and so it is hard to get excited about the actions you are taking.

That said, I actually really like the "speculate" idea and would like to see it used in another game.  A mechanic that uses a kind of long-term prediction of others actions, as well as providing a sort of impetus to not take those actions if they can to prevent you from earning (here it just felt like you just had to earn people many and you had no choice).

Addendum: This bugged me, so I'm going to comment on it.  Your minion tokens are neat, but they're used only for speculation.  It feels like they should be out gathering body parts and controlling electricity, but instead they're gambling on scientific futures.  "Igor!  Go get me some stock in steel providers, and keep an eye on the blueprint and patent office for me."  "But... Fresh brains?  Organs?" "I said patent office!" "Yes, master...  *grumble*"

Components: Good artwork and clever invention names. The graphic design and overall production quality feels a bit simplistic and rushed.

Experience: Not very much going on here. Because the inventions I build have no lasting effect, the act of speculating is the only strategic component of the game; the rest is just trying to earn enough money to buy the best toys.

The variable endgame conditions don't work here nearly as well as they do in Kingdom Builder.

Theme is amusing. I like the change from one game to the next with the Twists, but the opportunity for clever game play is few and far between. Occasionally, you can call Invent without enough money knowing that someone will call a task you have spies on that will give you enough money to build. Getting useful inventions is up to the whim of the cards, if you don't have Inventions that give you more cards, or end up with a lot of expensive inventions, there isn't much you can do about it, but take another card and $2 each turn.

This is a pretty good light/filler game though I found myself a bit disoriented by the dichotomy of some actions being simultaneous but others requiring strict ordering. Chaotic is the word that best describes this game.

Mechanically, it works. There is nothing violently horrendous about the game. However, the game is very boring. The twists in the game increases the variability, but I don't see it solving the problem of the core gameplay being just plain boring. It is also quite a fiddly game, for what it offers.

Players are mad scientists, attempting to invent evil inventions and score victory points for them.  Simple game where players simultaneously play actions face down and reveal them.  If players have minions positioned that match the actions chosen by other players, they receive a small, but important cash bonus.  Then actions are resolved... Speculate (place a minion), Invent (declare an invention card, pay for it, and apply effects), Research (draw a new invention card, and a little cash), or Work (get more cash).  Repeat until someone declares 20 victory points, mainly from inventions.  Really simple, fast, fluid, free flowing game that I found totally charming.  The deck of "Twist" cards mixes up the game by just the right amount by introducing two special rules for that game.  Liked it a lot.

Quick filler that works as a very light action selection game.   Minions are not workers, but rather they function as bets which pay off if you place the minions on actions that are selected by your neighbors.   So, there is some guesswork involved.   Money is used to build inventions, which have one-shot effects.  Sadly, there are no persistent effects.   Headlines or "twists" are used to give each game two unique special rules.   I can see where these are the saving grace of Nefarious.  Without those, there is not much here.   I imagine this would be a good alternative for times when you are sick of 7 Wonders.   It fills that same sort of niche.

Fairly uninspired game play is a vehicle for the interesting and sometimes funny invention cards.  Few, if any, interesting strategy decisions.  Overall, mildly amusing as a filler or with those who enjoy a 50's Sci Fi atmosphere.

RATING: 5
Nefarious is a good filler game. Its simple to teach, has ample player interaction, and loads of variety. The only disappointment is that the variety is too tame. In each game of Nefarious, players will reveal two 'twists' which alter the rules for that play, but the 'twists' are often inconsequential. The twists might encourage more research or more rapid invention, but need a little more bite too really inject this game with life. Each player is given a handful of agents which they can disseminate in hopes of providing future income, which is a fun way to establish player interaction. If somebody takes an action with my agents on it, they'll owe me money, and this mechanic adds a nice disincentive facet to the game. Overall, Nefarious is a fun battle of mad scientists, which didn't fully embrace its hallmark feature of wild variability.

Interesting.
I do like simultaneous action selection, but 4 choices seems a bit of a narrow selection, and one action, espionage feels a little tacked on.
The three other actions gain you momentum towards building your doomsday device, but espionage just taxes the player to your left and to your right, you can even tax the player to the point they are unable to undertake the action and thus lock them out of the game completely..... obviously this is quite the design flaw, however this was a demo game and thus we probably were not playing by all of the rules.

It is a shame since the theme is awesome and I kind of like the artworks, but the game is just mediocre.

In essence this is a pretty simple card game that reminds me of Race for the Galaxy. However a few thing really make it stand out. First is the 2 special rules that make each game wildly different and very interesting. Second is the humor in the art and theme. Both of these make the game a blast to play.

A relatively simple family-style hand-management and "guess what your opponent is going to do" game that changes almost every time it's played because of the huge number of Twist cards that bring new rules or ways to get points into play - and only 2 Twist cards are used per game. It's not very strategic, but your ability to make the all-important cash you need can be greatly influenced by your ability to guess which of four action cards your opponents will play each round.

The artwork is great, and young people will get a kick out of the various inventions that can be built, including the very nerdy "buttered cat array". This is a game I'd like to buy when it comes out, simply because it fills the niche of a 30-45 minute light family game that stays interesting after repeated plays.

RATING: 4
Nefarious is an action selection game that is somewhat reminiscent of Race for the Galaxy, except that the actions have been streamlined so much that the game got lost somewhere in the process. Hm, no, that's not quite correct. The game's still there but pretty faceless, and since the only game functions left are collecting money and playing inventions with that money it's hard to feel invested about anything.

Possibly our favorite light game. The rules are simple, and the simultaneous actions mean that games with 6 people take roughly the same amount of time as those with 2 people.

While I agree with the criticisms about speculation and luck, I find that neither is enough to detract from the fun. Speculation is the best way to get money in the game and an interesting mechanic. While lucky card draws can win you a game, amassing a large hand of cards dramatically reduces the influence of luck. 

Some have said that they purchased this game for $60, which I would find quite high for the content of the game. However, at the $20 we paid this was a steal. A very fun and quick game that scales well from 2-6 players and has a lot of theme to boot.

The twists create the appearance of interesting decisions, suggesting that the value of certain inventions and actions would change, but in praxis the game boils down to drawing useful inventions since you cannot influence your card draw whatsoever.

This game is without soul.  It plays like the directions on a shampoo bottle, and keeping with the metaphor washes away any fun the theme could offer.  

Nefarious is a wasted opportunity.  I didn't like Dominion because I found it to be ultimately dry and mechanical -  like trying to be the most efficient candy inspector on a conveyor belt - but Nefarious takes the process even further.  No hard decisions, the inventions have no color, and the game play is derivative without attempting to offer anything new. It just sterilizes what other games (San Juan, Glory to Rome, Race for the Galaxy) do so well.

How can a game about mad scientist inventions feel so dull? 

When the inventions do nothing more than allow you to draw a card.

Ohhh look I can build a Doomsday device and all it does is give me 4 gold and remove a helper from the other players.  

This game is terrible.

A quick, light, silly filler about being a mad scientist creating crazy inventions with which to rule the world. Each turn players choose between four options. Depending on what you choose and what your neighbors choose, you gain certain benefits. Players race to build doomsday devices worth varying amounts of points. First one to the goal total wins the game.

Admittedly, there's not a lot going on here, but the theme made it very enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
First off I love the theme and the artwork.  Unfortunately they don't really integrate with the game.

The first time I played this it fell kind of flat for me.  I didn't really enjoy it, and felt that it was simply a matter of getting coins, buying the most expensive card in your hand, then repeat.  The cards you play don't have any effects besides points. I didn't want to ever play it again.

Then I played it again.  While I still don't think that it's a great game, it was okay. I think the addition of "event" cards helped.  Playing it was still a little formulaic so I don't think I'd play it again.

Cool art and a fun theme. I'll need to play more games before I decide how I feel about the mechanics. It doesn't seem particularly deep.

RATING: 4
Innocuous game whose only attractive feature is the theme of mad scientists intent on taking over the world. Sadly, however, the theme is very poorly implemented and the game feels at least as abstract as "Dominion". Likewise, there are many different cards - inventions, this time - that have just a few rather mechanical effects: gaining more cards, money or minions, or forcing opponents to lose the same things, and many cards only have a victory-point value.

Minions don't do anything even remotely interesting and are just used to "speculate", earning money from the future action selections of other players, apparently just to force some "interaction" into the game.

There are so-called twist cards that change the rules every game and supposedly add replayability, but I doubt they can do much to make it interesting. You just get money, get invention cards and pay to play them. And the randomness of those cards put the game firmly into the filler category.

It works and is quick enough that I wouldn't mind to give it a second or third go, just to see how the twist cards affect the gameplay, but then I will probably be done with it.

I may not finish without mentioning the inexistent art direction. The various artists are wildly different in style and quality, and the consequent lack of any visual identity really detracts from the game.

Like most Donald X games, we have a very simple basic system which is completely shaken up by the addition of a couple special rules cards each game. I love games like this, where the cards break the rules. Nevertheless, it's not perfect. I feel the first action is a bit too complex for the feel of the rest of the game, and leads to an annoying amount of arithmetic, especially at higher player counts. Additionally, some of the "harsher" special rules cards are considered anathema by my group. Even though I personally enjoy them, in such a light game, one does wonder if such punishing cards really belong. I don't think you can take this game very seriously as you are at the mercy of the cards drawn and the actions of other players to a large degree. Nevertheless, it's such a quick play and appeals to such a broad audience that it's forgivable.

Simultaneous action/role selection is a great mechanic but can be weighed down by too many choices. Nefarious just has four and it works wonderfully. It also never punishes players for bad planning, moreso rewarding careful planning. All of this wrapped up in an easy to digest card game with multiple twists makes Nefarious a hit.

A very silly card game, but oh boy is this fun! It's simply about getting money to build your inventions and score points, but the Twist cards subtly change the rules each time so money can be ultra tight, inventions more valuable etc. There's quite a high premium on getting cheap invention cards from the draw deck as expensive cards are very hard to build, so you could easily argue that this is all luck. However, we played four games of this back-to-back when we first tried it, and there aren't many games I can say that about.

Nefarious is a decent simultaneous action selection filler game. The lush production value let this appear larger than it is. The fun is in the super villain theme  which is supported by the good artwork. The gameplay itself is plain and a bit repetitious as players choose one of four available actions each round, doing the same things again and again. Replay value is achieved by randomly choosing two twist cards which change the environment for the game.

Enjoyable but Vaccarino's [gameid=151247] fills the same niche while providing more gameplay. I'm not sure if Nefarious' theme is enough to make it a keeper in the long run.

Sadly, my low rating is due to the incredibly poor quality of the components.

For gameplay, I'd have likely give it a 7 or 8 - it is a rather fun game.

But the components I'd give a 1-2.  So splitting the difference, let's say 4.

Cards are something between regular paper and 110lb card stock and bend easily.

Highly recommend you use a stiff sleeve and/or back the sleeves with playing cards or spare CCG cards you have laying about.

Edit : With the new components they sent me, I am moving it up to a 7.  Kudos to the manufacturer :)

Rules are easy to learn (takes 5 minutes).  Gameplay is easy too.  There is limited interaction (basically only through prospecting neighbors).

Take 7 Wonders, simplify it, and add a randomizing factor that will change strategy slightly for every game. I'm not sure it isn't the best move to just Speculate on Invent two or three times early on and proceed from there - I'd have to try it a few more times, but everyone who was close in the game I played had at least two minions hanging out there.

Anyway, this takes the simultaneous play aspect that makes 7 Wonders so much more of a joy than Dominion, adds some really nice (REALLY nice) Hugo Gernsback-esque graphic design work, and there you go. There are a few things I like less about 7W. 

1. You really have much less chance of countering people's strategies who are across the table from you. You get so few cards in the game that you just aren't necessarily going to take someone down who's stocked up on Minions, or who has fifty cards in their hand and always has the ones they need, etc. 

2. It'd be nice if, like 7W, each player had a role, a specialty, or something like that.

But I'm not sure the game is really robust enough to support that.

All that said, it is really good looking - have I mentioned that this game is gorgeous like Anne Hathaway is gorgeous? Or maybe more like Hedy Lamarr. Anyway, it's pretty, and every aspect is really thoughtfully laid out and easy to grasp.

You have to give Donald X. Vaccarino a lot of credit. My loathing for Dominion knows no bounds, but every time he comes up with a new game it shows that he's paying attention to his craft, picking things up from other games, while always keeping replayability at the forefront of his mind (by throwing in slightly randomized aspects in every game.) I'm not sure if this is the apotheosis of this style of card game or just fairly random, but it is a good way to spend 15 minutes with a large group.

RATING: 5
This game has a few interesting mechanics and great potential, but the gameplay is not so good. Let start with the positive:

The twist cards are awesome. Every game, you draw 2 or more twist cards that changes the rules of the game. That makes every game unique. It's surprising to see how much twist cards they could put in there.

The icons are clear. Invention cards have special powers expressed in icons. But since there is no hundreds of icons like in Race for the Galaxy or 51st state, the rules are clear and easy to learn.

Now the thing that is bad about the game, in my point of view, is the action cards and minion placement. The mechanic is completely anti-thematic. It's illogical that minions are used to predict opponent's action.

It's cool to have minions, but they should have taken a mechanic that fit more with the theme. Assigning minions to do some work. A similar example could be "leonardo da vinci". In this game, you can use your worker to work on inventions or gather resources and upgrades.

So instead, they could have placed a central common board where some actions are available to place minion on them. Actions would cost minions, and each invention would require an amount of money and an amount of minion to build it.

Else minions could be used to gather gold, help in research, steal other player's gold and inventions cards, etc.

Maybe player could acquire new minion with time by either by spending minions and/or money to train them or having some invention generate new minions.

In general it's a great idea, but the main mechanic was badly chosen for it's theme.

RATING: 5
Straightforward light game about competing mad scientists. It's silly and fun, but has enough meat for a gamer to chew on, I think. It's hard to talk about after one play because the Twist cards that change the game environment can really alter the dynamics. In our game, inventions ran twice, so it was pretty easy for one to cause a huge swing. Still, short, fun, and clever.

This is a game of random chance. You try to get cards into play, the powers and values of which are random, which the higher valued ones almost always being preferable (given that 20 points ends the game). Your investments can pay out variably, higher to those who are somewhat luckier with what their neighbors do and when that luck aligns with what is in their hand the the order of the actions they just have happened to take.

There's not much of a game here. You play, collect, and there's likely to be a couple of people close in score at the end. Someone will definitely win, but most will lose, simply for having played.

A bland game.  The replay value is in the multiple victory conditions (almost too many, frankly, since you'll not play through them all even after several games).  The game play does not have a good ratio of turn effectiveness vs. turn length, which is always a turnoff for me.

A little bit on the simple side. The game offers a little bit of flavor but it could have been expanded on a little bit. It's a bit simplistic in that the choices you are given aren't really that difficult and you never really feel like you need to do something other than what you would choose. The two events chosen at the start of the game can change things up in interesting ways.

The game is driven by the luck in card-drawing, if you get the right cards you can affect the game, otherwise you just sit and wait.

The cards are relatively humorous and nicely drawn, but I fear that doesn't help against the boring game-play.

Played this at BGG.Con 2011 in the Hot Games room.  I thought it was an okay game.  It was simple enough to learn as we literally sat down and read the instructions in like 20 minutes.  As I recall there is a fair bit of bidding as you try to become more and more of a nefarious scientist.

That being said I liked the game enough that I almost bid on a copy of it in the VFM for the upcoming 2013 con.  Decided to pass until I found a cheaper copy.

Light game with luck of the draw which is ok as the game is also very short. It's fun to play, and different each time because of the 2 'special cards' that change each game. 
Although some cards are funny, the reason I do not rate this game higher is because during play you don't actually look at what the card is, but rather only look at it function in the game. Therefore I had not the slightest feeling of being an evil scientist. 
But .... I would happily play it again.

It looks pretty but it's stunningly dull and random. I had the misfortune of playing the first game with a particularly wretched "twist" (the well-named Age of Boredom, which forces everyone to play at half speed by preventing them from picking the same action in succession). But that merely made a bad game worse. Short runtime, feels long.

Wow, this is pretty bad, and I'm not just talking about the components, which are of worse quality than if you made cards out of construction paper. Nefarious reminds me a lot of another DXV game I don't care for, Temporum, but this one has much more of a tactical feel than a strategic feel, which normally would be more up my alley. Unfortunately, the thematic connection just isn't there. Cards like Brain Switcher make sense, but they just aren't that entertaining or humorous. I don't know...this game just didn't do it for me. It's very bare-bones compared to his other games, and I just didn't like it.

Amazed at the various comments in the lower end of the voting.  Yes, there is a high luck factor. Yes, it is somewhat mechanical.  But, the twists really do change how you approach the game.  I always have fun playing this game. No it's not a deep strategy game, but it doesn't pretend to be.  I guess some folks insist on certain game play elements for a game to be enjoyable.  I prefer a different approach.

I had high hopes for this one.  After playing I got stuck with over 4 cards that had a high cost for high points, with no abilities to use.  It made for a boring game where I would work, work, work, work (for 4 gold), than invent my big point card, while others were pulling off combos.

Nefarious is an action selection card game.  It seemed to me that it would make for cool combos, but I only saw opponents doing that.  I had no feeling of inventing doomsday devices.

meh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Now that it's finally out for publication -- I've been playtesting this game for a while -- I can finally come out and say it: Nefarious is hecka-fun.

I'm only dinging it slightly because sometimes... well, sometimes you get two Twists that collectively suck the fun out of the game.  Either one alone would be fine, but the two of them combo-up to grind the game to a halt in what should be a speedy, blind-bid, twirled-mustache-a-thon.

Because this game SINGS when it sprints.  It's over almost before it starts in a way that Transamerica does, but unlike that game Nefarious leaves you with a feeling that all of your actions had meaning and purpose, and if you only had one more blah-blah-blah.  Your kids will love it, and you'll enjoy it as well.  Just, y'know, call a mulligan when you see a deadly Twist combo.

RATING: 7
"Quick (15-45 minute) tableau game for 2-6p, with a cute theme, and no targeted pvp attacks. OOP but with the possibility of a reprint at some point."

What I like:
- Simple rules; cute theme
- "Attack" cards hit all your opponents
- Plays very quickly (15-45 minutes), but has some decisions 
- Supports up to 6 thanks to simultaneous play
- Twist cards really change the flavor of each game

What I don't like:
- Minion colors don't match action cards (not that it matters)
- I would like a way to benefit from cards you don't want to build

Of the 64 inventions, 4 hurt everyone including whoever played them. Another 10 hurt everyone except whoever plays it. For a friendlier game, you could probably leave out those 10 or 14 inventions, although that would increase the value of minions. 

I more or less agree with the BGG-voted weight of 1.7.

I traded my copy away at OOP values, figuring a reprint was likely. It's a good game, and now that new copies are available again, I wouldn't mind getting a copy.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Clean design - The designer knows its trade for sure! But for this theme there is too little ahem theme in the game.Most inventions (including the nerferious Death ray) are just used to gain VP. The inventions that doe things just manage money, minions and cards. OK for a abstractish game, too little for a thematic game.

RATING: 4
3/14 - You want to play this fast. Play it in 15 minutes, and it works fine. You don't build an engine, and depending on the global effects you may have to play differently. Cardflow is probably important most of the time.

A nice filler game that plays well with all player counts. Has the usual Donald X twists to it.

[b]Update:[/b] Holy shit the components in the new edition are terrible. The worst card stock I've seen in a game outside of Polis. Hell, the reprint of Downfall of Pompeii has better card stock. It's really, really thin. I've literally sleeved the cards and used MtG cards to prevent them from bending.

Game is still great, but holy shit.

[b]Update 2:[/b] So USAopoly fixed the issue and I was sent replacement cards/coins. They are much, much better although still a bit flimsy. I like the game quite a bit, but it's definitely a light filler. Needs the right group to really enjoy it.

A very quick casual game. Sometimes too quick, with turns flying by so fast that it's easy for players to accidentally take their actions before they should. Even if players slow down, this is short enough to be a filler game.

The different twist cards are pretty cool. There's definitely some that I don't think would be very fun under any circumstance and others that I feel should've been implemented into the base rules to begin with,

Overall: I've had both bad and great sessions of Nefarious depending completely on the twists. I like the style and mechanics of the game but I feel like I'd enjoy it more if there was just a little bit more meat on it's bones.

First off this is a filler game and should be thought of as this. It has simple play but the twist cards make this game because each game is so different.  the twist card change the basic mechanics or perhaps goals of the game.  Sometimes this game can be a strategy game while other times its a tactical game and even sometimes it can be a heavy luck of the draw game which probably turn some off but each game is so different. The artwork is entertaining and the game is just fun.    After quite a few plays is might be the best filler I have ever played.  So simply but each game is so completely different and works great with 2.

I just didn't see a point to this game.  Everyone pretty much moved up in points at the same rate.  It seemed fairly irrelevant which role you picked each turn, other than that at some point you wanted to Survey to build, and there didn't seem to be any sort of long-term planning at all.  It was quick, and not painful, so I could probably be talked into playing again, but I can't see me ever choosing to.

Interesting - it is a Euro that had moderate to high luck, and a lot of player interaction. However, it does seem that it fails to do this very well.

Nefarious --

Played once; three-player.

Fun theme and funny hunchbacked minion-meeples.  The core mechanic is clear and simple, which is something I look for in a game.  But the overall game seemed less simple than simplistic.  Not enough there to keep my interest.  Inventions are the only source of victory points, and inventions are only obtained by spending coins.  So play boiled down to getting coins, and spending them on inventions.  

I think this game has great bones, but it needs to be fleshed out more.

Played 1 3P game. Nefarious is surprisingly more amusing than I expected. The simultaneous action selection and inventions are decent mechanisms - what makes the game [i]really[/i] tick are the twists which alter how the game plays out. Our one game had Embezzling Minions as one of the twists, so our cash totals were constantly being knocked down. Gaining money then became a gamble, since you'd always want to hit the magic numbers of multiples of 5. Sure, the game was slow as a result, but it didn't outstay its welcome either. A fine silly filler.

The twists in the game I played essentially broke the game.  Even without that, the game seems to be decided by the inventions you draw instead of any meaningful decisions.

RATING: 7
Superlight little filler with a really big pricetag.

I think that the design is really cute, and I think that the condition cards will mix things up quite a bit.  But all in all, I'm not sure if there is a lick of strategy here.  You figure out a way to make money, you draw cards to play and then you play the cards that you can afford.  That's about it.  

It's like a really, really simplified Race for the Galaxy.

It has its merits, but $65 for a $15 cardgame...no.

After first plays it seemed a little lighter than expected but was still an enjoyable quick game ...

After quite a few more plays, I have accepted it's light nature and love it as a 6-player filler or startup game for the night.  The best part is that it takes 20/30 minutes to play ...

RATING: 6
There are a few interesting things happening with this game, and my rating may be a bit negatively-biased by having a pre-formed (very positive) opinion of the game author that led me to be quite disappointed with the two games that he released this year.  However, after trying this twice with different scoring cards, I thought, "Well, it certainly works, but is it fun?".  The theme was one that should have carried it for me, but even that didn't really stick.  It's a nice game, with cute artwork, and it feels like a very polished first design of a budding game author, not the sophomore effort of a budding legend.

I have the first edition and find the production quality is much better than the second edition. That said, it's a simple game that is interesting to play once every several months. It's not very interactive or unique, but it's fast enough to not outstay its welcome.

Quick, easy to learn and lots of fun. The combination of Twist cards makes every game unique. The challenge is, to find appropriate strategies for each of the combos. In one universe you will have no chance without minions, in another one you do not need them at all. Sometimes you have only few ressources and look for cheap inventions, sometimes everybody is loaded and all are going for the big ones. This game really suprises me every time and I became addicted instantly. Due to its short playing time you can play 5 in a row and will always find something new in it.
A typical Vaccharino - the core mechanism is simple to the max, but underneath you will find complexity and interaction. One of my personal Essen2011 highlights.

RATING: 6
Quite chaotic card game with board game action selection element. Trying to use minions and cards to get resources to build evil inventions which you can use to take over the world. Extremely random and projects are all unbalanced.  Still, doesn't take long and a good title for kids, especially.

Pretty light and enjoyable filler.  Goofy mad scientist theme.  Game play is extremely simple, but the twist cards really provide a .... twist so every game is different.  The inventions are amusing but they are essentially just victory points.  I wish they affected play more.  Card stock quality is really poor.  Very thin cards, so I recommend investing in a good set of sleeves.  

Update:  USAopoly has replaced my first edition invention cards, twists and coins with new and much higher quality ones.  Wow!

RATING: 7.2
An almost too-fast playing card game that is a lighter version of San Juan and Race for the Galaxy. I enjoy it more than both of those games, but it becomes so light that players (in the 2 games I've played) quickly stop paying any attention to each other to the point where players end up playing different rounds at the same time.

That level of multiplayer solitaire turns me off.

Up from 6.7 to 7.2.

An innocuous game about accumulating resources. It's a bit too repetitive and random for my tastes. The inventions that other people play can often trash your plans arbitrarily. That said, it's quick to play, which helps.

RATING: 5
After 10 plays I am not convinced that tactical play results in wins.  Luck of the draw on invention cards seems to highly influence the game outcome when both players don't make any major mistakes in gameplay.

RATING: 6
Right now, this is my go-to game for 4-6 players if we need something for 30-45 minutes.  Very little down time also, which is a huge plus.  Good decisions, planning what other players are going to do, and fun art all help.  It is also nice that it is interactive somewhat (you get payoffs depending upon what other players choose to do, if you anticipated it) without being "screw-you"ish at all. UPDATE: Moving it down from 8.5 to 8.0 - I'm not as interested lately in playing it.  Luck from invention card draw seems to have more people complaining about it when we do.  Still pretty fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game works but fails to be more than mediocre. Lots of "take that" cards thrown at your face so it's impossible to plan farther ahead than one turn. 
I only tried this in Essen because it's designed by Donald Vaccarino but must say I was not impressed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A rather simple role-selection game with an engaging theme. It's simple and short enough that I have no real issues, but I rather suspect the game balance is off, especially as one of the four actions - Speculate - is almost never a good option given how easily henchmen can be removed (often two at a time) by other players' inventions. Still, Nefarious is quick and engaging enough that I'd play despite some minor flaws.

RATING: 3
Certainly not a good game. You take actions to get money, take actions to get cards, then take actions to play the cards by spending your money. That's not a terrible system by itself. The problem is that there is a lot of take-that and the luck of the draw can be huge. The decisions are all obvious as well. If you need cards, then take the action that lets you draw cards. If you need money then take the money action.

RATING: 5
Far inferior to Mad Science Foundation for the aspiring Mad Scientist.  I guess the biggest problem with this in comparison is that the theme almost seems superficial whereas MSF really integrates the wackiness into game play, also I think the mechanics of the game itself stay fresher longer in MSF.  The only advantage Nefarious has over MSF is that it plays up to 6 players, where MSF maxes out at 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nefarious is a fairly simple little game. Every turn you can play one of four actions, which involve getting money, getting cards, building cards and a way to put markers on actions so that you get money when neighbors take an action. The first person to build cards that total 20 or more points wins.

The interesting thing about this game is that there is a deck of 60 cards which have alternate rules modifications, and each game you draw two of them to be in effect. Which means that every game will likely play very differently.

This definitely falls into the lighter/filler side of games, but given that it's a pretty interesting game given how quickly it plays.

I am very glad that I had the opportunity to play this in the Origins Board Room. Nefarious is definitely one of the most fun games I've played in a while, and will definitely give 7 Wonders a run for its money. The Twist cards are intriguing, as they provide a good amount of replayability. I definitely forsee this climbing the rankings, and am looking forward to its ascent. Since 7 Wonders is ranked 12, surely this will make the top 100.

Provisional rating, one play.  Love the theme, the humour and the card art.  Gameplay was OK. but I suspect would have been better without that game's particular twist, the discarding of unplayed inventions.  Nonetheless, it's the twist mechanism that makes the game replayable, and it seems to be replayability that is Vaccarino's design signature.

Initial impression after one play.  I had a good idea of how the game played, but in reality it wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.  I thought there would be more crazy situations happening with inventions, but most seemed really tame.  Strategies seemed really one-dimensional.

Nail in the coffin for me was the incredibly shoddy components.  Cheapest punchboard and flimsiest cardstock that I've ever encountered.

RATING: N/A
A fast fun filler. I literally got taught the rules while the other players were planning their first moves. Players simultaneously play one of four action cards, which do things like draw cards, earn money, build cards for points, or speculate what other players might play. Building inventions earns points, and might cause other effects like forcing other players to discard cards, etc. The inventions your mad scientist can build are truly a hoot.

As with most Vaccarino games, there is a deck full of cards which change the rules of the game, only two of which are in play for any given game. So one game to the next should be quite different based on which particular rules changes are in play.

First, the good points. I really like the investment system; it feels unique and adds good Race for the Galaxy-type interaction (in that it benefits you to guess what other players are going to do). The theme and cards are fun. Finding synergies with the Plot Twists gives me a comparable feeling to noticing a great, non-obvious combo in Dominion (not just because they share a designer), and that's a very good thing for me.

My biggest issue with it is that there's often not a lot you can do about a bad hand - or, put another way, you can usually only fix a bad hand if you draw a card that lets you fix a bad hand. For this one, that's the difference for me between "a game I'd want to own" and "sure, I'd play that again" (which is where I'm at now). Add something to make the draw a little less random (draw 3 keep 1, or some face up cards) and this is probably an 8 for me.

This one surprised me. I wasn't sure what to expect really, but this is a pretty light, Ticket to Ride weight card game with role selection and simultaneous actions. In some ways, it's like Race for the Galaxy distilled down to the smallest possible ruleset while still offering some choices. You could teach this game to nearly anyone and finish in less than 45 minutes (and likely faster).

Recommended for the right crowd.

RATING: 4
All hail Monster Yahtzee. Shines at 4-5p with the right crowd to stoke the showmanship of it, but elsewhere it can fall flat. In particular, once you're down to just 2 players, the game sort of comes apart in regards to attacks and stars. The other problem is people want to collect stars and wimp out; this is a Godzilla form of demolition derby, quit hiding. Great when folks get into the group (best with giant foam dice, people get into some sort of costume or getup, maybe an MC to stoke it). Also good with small children to get them into gaming or to for new people who have no background with gaming. Sort of lame the rest of the time.

Chuck dice, beat each other up with monsters, and collect cool powers along the way; this pretty much sums up King of Tokyo. Without the powers I would rank this much lower, and as long as you don't play with too many players this is a fun chaotic game that always makes me want to play again.

7-31-2014: I enjoy this as a quick filler game, but there is not a whole lot here other than dice rolling. Good as a filler, but not for the main event.

Rolling a bunch of dice multiple times a turn is repetitive and gets boring quick. Some interesting decisions can come up when rerolling dice, but there's not much to the game.

[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

King of Tokyo is a very solid filler that's great for kids -- just what I wanted to add to the collection. I call it "Yahtzee with monsters." Basically, players try to roll specific combos on their dice to punch other monsters, gain victory points, and buy special abilities with energy cubes; all without letting their health drop to zero! First player to 21 points wins. 

This is not a game that I'd call my personal favorite, as I love more complex and strategic games. Then again, I've only played it once so there's very likely more here than meets the eye. However, I love seeing other people have fun and King of Tokyo really makes our game selection more well-rounded for the game group, so everything works out all right. This is a great game if kids are around and want to play something simple, or if you've got a bunch of non-gamers with no stomach for complicated rules. Only takes about fifteen minutes to explain and not too much longer than that to play (plus, chunky dice and cutout monsters are always a solid addition to any game).  

Verdict: Simple to explain, very simple to play. Fun for everyone. Bonus points if players get into their monster personalities. 6/10, recommended.

A fun game.  Also, a great example of a game that requires it's expansion to shine.  The base game is good, but you throw in 'Power Up' and it really takes off.  The monsters in the vanilla game all play exactly the same, and everyone will have basically the same strategy (which is cool, but gets repetitive).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
Dice game that is lots of fun. Simple rules, great artwork and stuff, cool card abilities and dice. The only part I don't dig so much is that you can win by going off into a corner and just rolling for the 3 point combos without fighting. LAME

Yep this at it's core Yahtzee with player elimination but it damn well works as a great filler game that scales relatively well. The only down side is that games can occasionally explode early eliminating players and leaving two or three to grind out a game.

What's great about King of Tokyo, as I'm sure everyone else has already said, is that it is so easy to teach and to play and it's light and just simply a fun time. It does tend to last a little longer than I'd like at times. My grandson (7) LOVES it though so seeing his utter enjoyment makes it worth bringing to the table.

GIVEN AWAY to my 2 younger cousins :-) Feb 2012.

Just super fun - do you go toe to toe with your opponents or hide in the corner quietly gathering points and powerful cards to come out swinging at the right time? Whatever happens in each game = fun. Lots of dice to roll, brilliant artwork and EVERYONE I have played this game with thinks it is decent and all seem to want to play again. King of Tokyo is the King of the 15 minute game.

It's Yahtzee with combat, card-buying, and an awesome theme. If you're looking for a medium-weight or heavy game, this is not it. However, it's a great, perfect game. It's short, it has dramatic moments, it is social, full of interaction.. there's a lot to love here. It can easily appeal both to completely new gamers and to the very experienced, who will see it as a nice game to warm up with or to play as a longer filler. Probably going to buy the power-up at some point.

Yahtzee-ish with giant monsters.  This game is full of in your face attacking.  Winning by points is certainly do-able as people often turtle up to heal, but that is the chump way to win.  This is our second go to game to bring people to the hobby.

This was a HUGE hit with my friends, which is a big bonus for me because it gets everybody together and excited for gaming! The monsters are awesome, the superpowers are full of diversity, and the risk/reward of entering/exiting the city push the intensity skyward. 

I guess the real selling point for me is the fact that I've always loved Yahtzee mechanics, but Yahtzee itself feels so hollow. The different methods of achieving victory also add to why I like it. You can try to go all out with attacks or try for the points or try for some cards that may give you the edge in both scenarios. I wasn't sure I'd really like this game, but when I found it on sale and tried it with some friends, it wasn't until we were playing and then playing again and then playing again that I realized how brilliant and fun it was.

This is a great example of a game that fills a role in my collection. So often, I only desire games that are full of strategy and slow-burn progression, with story elements and special abilities. Those games are usually pretty time-consuming and difficult to get to the table with certain groups, so I need games that I can enjoy when I'm unable to get my favorite fix. And it's to the credit of these kinds of games that they fill that void and do it so well. That's reason enough for it to be high on my list.

I'm not a fan of take-that, direct conflict games.  This one plays pretty quickly, though, so it's not bad as a filler.

UPDATE: With some additional plays, the game has grown on me just a bit.  There's not a lot of ability to target specific players, so there's less direct conflict than I first thought.  Increased my rating from a 5 to a 6.

5/25/13 - First play. Solo test run. Fun, but I can see how it is lacking with only 2 monsters. The Kracken was very lucky rolling VP's and beat the Mecha Dragon at 13 points. I'm eager to play it with more people... and monsters.

After playing with my wife, it appears that this will be going on the shelf. She didn't appear to enjoy it. *Sigh* I really need to stick to only buying Solo games.

This is the perfect game for our family right now. Even my non-gamer teenage daughter likes to play (although she tries to just be a pacifist and win with energy card combos). We usually play with four to six players, but my son (12) and I sometimes play a few rounds one-on-one. One variation we like to use when we do this is to decide on a number (between 5 and 20) and then randomly deal out seven to ten energy cards each. We then get to keep any number of cards that total in cost equal to or lesser than the number we chose. If we choose a high number (10 or more), then we play that we can only put one of these free cards into play at the start of each turn, while temporary (single-use) cards may be held indefinitely. Other cards can still be purchased as normal.

Let me start by saying that I would kill to have a shirt that has the Urbavore on it (it only eats urban areas!) This is another game I was introduced to at a friend's birthday party. And the first round I was just watching and cheering the destruction on! The people who didn't know me were shocked at how much I was getting into the game (Crush that monster! You call two damage a lot? Go back to the slime pit you crawled out of!) But come on, who doesn't love the cheesy old giant monster movies? Gamera anyone? 

This game combines my favorite things: clever cards, cute art, and utter DESTRUCTION! The first time I got to play, I got crushed before I could even have a turn – which admittedly did make me angry – but I calmed down, got back in the game, and played jointly with my husband (who is great at calming my wild rages). And while we didn't win the next game either, it was a ton of fun. 

But the third game was the one that we rocked! We had to perfect storm of cards – a card that allowed us to reroll all “3”s and a card where if you roll one of every symbol on six dice we gain 10 points. We did that twice. 20 points from two otherwise useless rolls. It was glorious. The cards really can change the dynamic of the game. And this is one I will definitely be playing again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Super-mega-filler in which players clobber each other mercilessly? That'll do, pig. I wish the monsters had individualized special powers, but we've sometimes used one a low-cost power each to start. Plays okay with 2, but definitely works better/best with 4-5.

Battle Yahtzee and King of the hill with a rampage theme. You play a monster whose goal is to either gain 20 vp first or to be the last monster standing at the end of the rumble in the east. You gain vp by entering and staying j. Tokyo, through cards, and by rolling certain combinations on your dice on your round. Fun, light, and quick this is a great game by the designer of mtg worth playing before or after a meaty one or with more casual gamer friends.

RATING: 6.5
I had very limited expectations for this game.  There seemed to be a lot of randomness involved and it really looked like a dice throwing contest.

I was wrong.  Luck is a good factor but there is some nice strategy twists as well :should you leave Tokyo or not? which dice should be re-thrown?  Should you buy this ability card or not?  

There are also bonus laughters garanteed in every games!

Seriously enjoy that one with my kids.

If you're looking for a party game with simple rules and relatively quick play-time, or if you're in the market for a game to introduce to your young child (maybe 6 or 7+ yrs old), this is the game for you.

KoT is extremely easy to learn, very smooth to play, and packs a lot of humor and whimsy in a small box. There isn't any real bean-counting that has to be done, as the little player "plaque" you have uses two sturdy little counter dials to keep track of your health and VP.

I can't say this enough: the theme and artwork are one of the strongest aspects of this game. Garfield et al clearly have a deep appreciation of the kaiju/monster movie genre, and it shows through in technicolor. My wife and I were giggling and reading out the flavor text on each power-up card that was flipped, and we've only seen 1/10th of the deck. I can't wait to see what other silly cards and beautiful designs lay in there!

The mechanics are a mix of push-your-luck dice-rolling, direct aggression, and some light strategy. Do you roll in an attempt to get energy cubes, or try and get more health? Or perhaps attack the monster in Tokyo, or [if YOU are that monster] attack everyone else? What about VP? Maybe you should roll for that!

The power-up cards are entertaining, and (as the name suggests) some are quite powerful! In another game, it might annoy me that some of the cards feel overpowered/unbalanced, but in KoT, it is all in service of the chaos and unpredictability of the game. Much like Love Letter or Ticket to Ride, people in the lead don't have an iron grip on their advantage, and the cards do much to shake up the ladder of players.

I love KoT, and I recommend it for anyone looking for a fun, light, and silly game to add to their collection. Eclipse or Power Grid this is not, so if Munchkin-style luck and aggression annoys you, you may wish to steer clear. However, if the theme appeals to you, and you have a spot in your collection for a simpler, lighter title, you can't go wrong with KoT.

Fun game for family and friends, a great party game. I played this with my nephews all the time and every time they were around, they would keep asking to take it out. It is very easy to learn, you don't need to much strategy, but if that is your cup of tea, it still can be strategic. I would suggest this for family, and parties!

Wow, this one hit the ground running. Our first game day with it was 3 weeks ago, and I think we played 5 straight games of it before moving on. My Dad had the best comment when asked if we should keep playing "I'd just as soon keep playing this, I'm having a great time, and I haven't even come close to winning once yet!" My group does like to beat each other up from time to time.

Pulled this out at the latest game day a couple weekends ago, and I wasn't super excited to, but once it came out, everyone had a really great time again. It's just fun. Thinking I need to grab the expansion now.

Still like it, but tired of pulling it out every game day, so sold it to Jeremy. Still fun, but not an every time type for me any more.

One of my family's favorite games.

It plays on the old Godzilla theme, except you are one of many monsters fighting for control of Tokyo and you don't care how much gets destroyed, so long as the others get damaged and you get "fame."

The core engine is a Yahtzee-based mechanic.  This is a Richard Garfield design, so that means it has plenty of expansions, but those expansions take a good game and make it better.

RATING: 7
A relatively simple game with big, chunky dice and gorgeous window dressing. The artwork drew me in first, and the large six-sided dice and humorous power-up and bonus cards kept me in. Half the game is its visual charm and light humor, but I can't say I felt like I was truly a giant monster stomping around, destroying buildings and having epic battles. Rather, it's a competitive points-acquisition/dice-rolling game centered around a king of the hill mechanic. 

Conceptually, where are the other monsters if they're not "in" Tokyo (the tiny board that comes with the game)? Why does one monster's attacks within a giant city impact every other monster not in the city next to him/her? It doesn't make much sense, but it's so pretty and simple you don't mind. Humorous and ridiculous scenarios on the item and bonus cards (often showing monsters that aren't one of the base set you can play as) help spur your imagination and visualize epic battles.

You can win by acquiring 20 points first or by eliminating all the other monsters. If you get knocked out of the game by losing all your life points, however, you hope for the remaining players/monsters to wrap it up quickly, which may or may not happen with the tug of war that can happen with certain item cards' hail Mary moves.

As for whether to get the expansions, I'd definitely recommend the (Panda-kai) Powered Up expansion as it makes the selection of monster actually have meaning. The Powered Up expansion provides unique ability cards that each monster can earn by rolling three hearts. Only in this way does each monster have a unique ability set and personality. Otherwise, the depth of your monster selection in the base game has about as much meaning and impact as the rest of the theme-- it's pure window dressing. That being said, Powered Up's monster-specific cards don't do as much as I'd like, as the odds of you acquiring and using more than one or two of them (out of a set of 12) in a given game is slim.

Thankfully, the base game, and the ability to roll and re-roll dice to your liking is fun enough on its own. King of Tokyo is a great gateway game-- light and pretty-- and a nice way to start up or end a night of gaming. Recommended.

Positives
- Easy to pick up and play
- Fantastic graphic design and theme
- Plays fast, encouraging "just one more round"
- For a game centered on dice rolling, it's nice you can always re-roll as many dice as you like at least twice

Negatives
- Theme is only skin-deep
- Monsters aren't unique without Powered Up expansion
- Easy to get knocked out of the game early and be sitting around waiting for it to end

I'm not a big fan of dice games, but this is on of the best I've ever seen. The idea of big monsters fighting each other like in those hysterical trash movies is splendid and the goofy artwork makes it ever more enjoyable.

For its characteristics King of Tokyo isn't only a great gateway game, that can be easily taught and enjoyed by non-gamers, but also a good filler game to take out, when you just want to have some fun without having to concentrate and build a strategy.

*When I heard of the theme I couldn't believe it hadn't reached a mainstream audience before. There's some quirky component choices (redundant tokens, doubles of random cards, fluro dice) aiding the immersion.

*Multiplayer conflict games are a great argument for the redundancy of modern boardgames: they have kingmaking, turtling and opportunism in spades. King of Tokyo avoids most of these problems. You are attacking the same area, so no favouritism. The leader gets to hit everyone else equally: no turtling. It's incredibly innovative in such a simple ruleset.

It is a simple game, easy to learn. The cards give enough modifications to a monster so the game stays fresh. My son loves it and I could hardly get his 10 - rating down to a 9. When we play it we mostly fight monster vs monster and don't go for VPs. Playing with more than 2 people one is advised to keep and eye on these VPs since one might win thru keeping out of the fights.

Easy to learn, fast to play, fun.

It's a pretty boring non-game that might keep kids out of your hair for a couple of hours. Roll dice. Roll more dice. Play a generic game-theory version of Chicken to push your luck (google game of Chicken if you don't know what this is). It's Yahtzee plus chicken. Most of the board isn't even used and could be replaced by a couple coffee stains on your table. The base game offers no difference in the characters either, so they amount to nothing more than a d12 for health and a d20 for victory points. The entire game is basically the custom dice and the cards. As such, it's overproduced and underdelivers. The expansions add a bit more fun but we're not talking buy-worthy.

Kind of a Yahtzee with a funky monsters attacking Tokyo theme pasted over it. I don't inherently have a problem with that, but the mechanics of moving in and attacking Tokyo while taking  a beating from everybody else as you do so are kind of odd. And I didn't feel that the action cards could be utilized nearly as much as they should be to be interesting. Clever idea, fun bits, meh execution.

Pros
- Monsters fighting
- Dice are cool and fun to roll
- Super power cards are fun
- Components are colorful and look like fun
- Accessible to non-gamers due to the Yahtzee dice rolling mechanic 

Cons
- Sometimes you DON'T want to go into Tokyo which makes little sense for a King of the Hill type of game
- Winning with victory points seems underwhelming 

Sold/Traded because:
- The group wasn't too big of a fan of it
- The theme didn't really come through
- Player elimination meant others had to sit out for a while

RATING: 4.5
At best, King of Tokyo is just a bunch of random events that occur before ending in short order. Theoretically there are some choices (which you can attempt to make using the Yahtzee mechanic), but they all balance out the same, so there's no real difference between getting Door A or Door B, and often you're not able to get what you were going for anyways. So, in the end, it's not much different than Uno, but far shorter.

But, if you get 6+ players, anyone not killed in the first 10-15 minutes will get enough power-up cards to become almost invincible, causing the game to stretch out for 2-3 hours, as the 2-3 invincible players try to kill one another, which is less than thrilling if you have been eliminated than the game. (And the one time I was one of the invincible players, I still wasn't terribly thrilled, since it's still just elaborate Uno, for 2-3 hours.)

Overall, I'd suggest playing King's Kilt over King of Tokyo. Guaranteed to last only 15 minutes and some actual choices to be made.

Countless plays since 2012. Likely won't see much table action any time soon with King of NY recently acquired (and preferred by me).

My most played board game ever. At 64 at the time of writing this that is far and away the most plays. It is one of my favorite games and definitely the game that people request to play the most. It's easy to teach and really fun. I typically don't like elimination games but this one works well. It's nice and short and does not overstay it's welcome. Fabulous game that is best, I feel, with four- six players. Five actually being my favorite.

RATING: 6
2-6(4,5)

Obviously streaky, and with a fair bit of randomness, but it's great in corporating a Yahtzee set-making with pushing your luck (in Tokyo). You can't really choose who you attack (though the guy occupying Tokyo is gaining points by the round), but the two win conditions really do sort of balance the play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Light, monster movie fun from Richard Garfield, with a combative Yahtzee mechanic combined with a leveling-up system.  Not a lot of strategic depth here, though there is a large tactical component to the rerolls and power cards.  Player elimination would usually be a strike against it, but it plays so fast you won't be sitting out for long after your monster dies.

King of Tokyo reveals the depth of my weariness with Yahtzee variants.  You all love this game, while my soul groans at being asked to roll six dice up to three times, making sets.  King of Tokyo is mercifully short and quite painless and its theme is amusing.  Not all bad then.

Production quality is decent, but the monster artwork struck me as a bit rubbish.

A hilarious romp where players act as gargantuan beasts, intent on taking over Tokyo (a'la Godzilla).  Simple mechanism where players roll dice and bash the hell out of each other, but it's not all bashing.  You need to balance your health and victory points, gain energy, which allows you to buy power-up cards to affect play.  Fabulous cartoony artwork underpins a light, tactical luck fest that is simply lots and lots of fun.  Quick to learn and play, in around 20-30 mins.  Works best with 5-6 players, not so good with 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
An incredibly accessible game, which accommodates 2-6 players very well.  Nice, quick games means you'll play several times each time you get it out.  We've played it 20+ times in the 3 weeks we've had it.  My kids love it, and there's enough to mull over to keep me interested.  A very good game by a very good designer.

UPDATE (05/10/2014): In my view, this will prove to be another Richard Garfield classic, right up there with Magic: The Gathering and RoboRally.  If you have kids, you can't go wrong here.  We have played this game repeatedly and consistently since I purchased it a few years ago.

By far the best game to play with non gamers.  Also, best way to introduce people to Euro games!  This game will introduce new gamers to the idea of collecting sets, gaining resource cubes, acquiring and using special ability cards, and getting victory points.  Also its just great fun on every level.  Another game that goes everywhere with me.  Only issue I have with the game is the rolling for VPs strategy becomes dominant with 5-6 players, but I fix this by only playing with 4.

Frothy rolling of dice again and again to determine results, then watching other players roll their dice, and seeing those results.  Hoping they will not roll what they need to roll, and hoping you roll what you need to roll.  Not exactly a thoughtful game.  More like a group exercise. Kind of very well appointed game of Yahtzee, which is, after all, a bestseller.

I have many dice games in my collection, especially ones that can be considered as "Yahtzee on steroids" (Roll Through the Ages, Dice Town, etc.).

For me, King of Tokyo is a rare game that perfectly fills its niche as a fun and immersive dice filler.

The game is essentially a reskinned Yahtzee, but that is ok to me, since I liked Yahtzee as a child. The monster theme and power cards are great additions. Plays quickly and the fact that it can support a decent amount of players are both positives in its favor. Very swingy (had one game where a player in Tokyo rolled 6 paws, eliminating 3 players in one turn) and there really isn't a strategy so much as you're just being pure reactionary the whole game. It is definitely one of those games that lends itself well to session stories.

Rolling dice and taking names. That's what it's all about. Will you build up enough energy to power yourself up? Or maybe hang about the outskirts to collect points? Or are you gonna tear your way into Tokyo and demolish everything and everyone? Chances are good you can win using one or all of these methods. Plus you do it all by chucking dice! LOVE IT!Now if it just played better with 2 players. If you just play it with 2 it becomes and back and forth game of "Tokyo is mine! No! Tokyo is mine!"

___________________
\_______GER_______/
Das Spiel ist ja schon einfach gestrickt, aber es macht einfach eine Menge Spaß mit seinem Monster entweder die 20 Ruhmespunkte zu erreichen oder einfach alle anderen Monster in die See vor Tokyo zu versenken.
Eigentlich hat das Spiel allen Mitspielern bisher Spaß gemacht (Familie von 8 bis 85 Jahren; wobei das hohe Alter sogar fast gewonnen hätte wenn nicht eine monströs unfaire  Wiederbelebungskarte einem schon scheintoten Monster am Ende noch den Sieg ermöglich hätte ...).
Nur Spieler die das Spiel etwas zu Ernst nehmen und dem Würfeln im Allgemeinen mit Argwohn begegnen haben weniger Spaß an diesem Spiel. Das Thema hatte jedenfalls bisher noch niemanden vom Mitspielen abgehalten. Und in einer Runde von 3 bis 6 Spielern hatten wir unseren Spaß gehabt. Für einen ganzen Spieleabend reicht es natürlich nicht aber zum Anfang oder Ende eine lustige Sache.

Da mir das Grundspiel schon gut gefallen hat, musste das Pandamonster aus der Erweiterung [thing=127067]Power Up![/thing] dann unbedingt auch noch dazu...
Der Panda hat totales Niedlichkeitspotential und wird sicherlich gerne als Hauptfigur ausgewählt werden.
Die Mutationskarten geben extra taktische Möglichkeiten die das Spiel wieder etwas weiter vom einfachen Kniffel entfernen. Ob man diese Erweiterung unbedingt haben muß, ist eine andere Sache (also unbedingt sicherlich nicht, aber schaden kann es auch nicht).

A very good party game, with simple rules. Its not a game to take too seriously, since its 80% luck.. but it provides many funny moments. Only minus, the player elimination.. someone can be out of the game pretty fast and then , have to wait for 20 minutes for the rest  to finish..

A good gateway game that has more strategy than you'd originally expect from a Yahtzee-style dice game. Very easy to teach and plays pretty fast. Great theme with large, fun visuals.

One downside is that I don't feel like the game scales very well. It plays at best by far with four players, with more players weakening the points strategy because health is always an issue with more players to punch you.

Pretty impressed with this dice-rolling, player-eliminating megafiller.  I like the production in general, and the compact design.  I've played with three and six, and thought the play length was fine both ways.  Happy enough to replay, and I imagine that I'll hardly need to be reminded on the rules, if at all - I always like that, regardless of complexity!

I had been avoiding this game for a long time, as it was referred to as battle yahtzee. I loathe yahtzee. However, this game was a blast. I played with a friends family that were just getting into board games. Of all the light family games I have played, this one is my current favorite. Colorful layout and easy to understand rules are big plusses. Player elimination and high luck are my only gripes, but it is still a solid family game.

A very light/filler game, but one that's quite fun to play.  Easy rules (Yahtzee-like) with several paths toward game end (roll for hits, roll for heals, roll for victory points, roll for energy cubes?) allow for several paths to be taken each and every game.

Quick setup, quick breakdown, (family) fun, simple gameplay with some strategic and tactical decisions, too -- a lot to like in one box.

Just realize it is what it is  -- this ain't no AP-prone Euro here at all...

There's not a lot of meat or depth to this game, but it's just a flat out good time, with mechanics that are simple enough to grasp for a broad range of casual players. Plays even better with the individual power up cards included in the first expansion. The components and dice are excellent, but I think it might be better served with a more elaborate board which could incorporate a few more intuitive rules.

King of Tokyo makes fun use of the Yahtzee dice-rolling mechanism. This game has a lot of back and forth "take that" to it. There is some strategy involved, but it is mostly just a fun, attacking, random type of game. The cards with special powers do add some interesting extra elements to the game. This game is really basic, but it is a ton of fun to play as a silly family game.

I never thought I'd like a Yatzee style, roll your dice and see the effect, type of game, until I played King of Tokyo.

It's still not that strategic, but it's fun nonetheless.

Although this is a kid's game, I am finding myself having immense fun with the dice rolling, monster noises, and gameplay of it all. The only issue that I had in the beginning with the game is that every monster was the same, but I understand this was to achieve balance in the first stages of the game. Other than that, I find this game to be truly fun, and if there was an online version of this game, I would totally be down to play this. Because of the fact that my gaming group is a tad bit older, I purchased the Power Up Expansion hoping to add a bit of strategy and variability to the gameplay.

Maybe it's because I've only played with new players and we were fumbling with the rules, but that shouldn't really be a problem with a dice game, shouldn't it? Or maybe I just got a little too hype up about from the BGG buzz.

RATING: 7
King of Tokyo is one of a number of light-weight dice games to come out in the last couple years.  It's got master designer, Richard Garfield's considerable talent behind it which gives it a leg up against other games competing for the same space in my closet.

KoT is a game of King of the Hill mixed with classic Yahtzee.  Rolling dice will do damage to other players, heal your own wounds, or give you points or energy.

Almost all dice games can suffer if they go on too long and this can certainly happen in King of Tokyo.  Games will usually only last about 30 minutes, but the ones that go longer feel WAY too long.

This is a problem made worse by the fact that King of Tokyo does have player elimination.  In my mind player elimination is always a weakness in a design.  It's a flaw that can be mitigated by short play-time, but I pretty much always dislike it when players get knocked out of a game.

So what I end up with is a somewhat uneven impression of the game.  When it is working -- when you have a buncha monsters slugging it out with lots of cool special powers on the table, and when the game is short (under 30 minutes), it's a very fun and very easy-to-play filler.  

but there are games that drag on for too long and end up being sort of boring.

the one bit of warning I would offer is that if all players are ONLY focusing on killing the other monsters (which is probably most gamers' natural tendency), the game has a much better chance of dragging on for too long.  The "victory by points" is a pretty reliable timer as long as one or two players at the table are keeping that as an option for winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I don't think staying in, or even going to, Tokyo is a good ideia, especially so with a lot of players. Since everyone can attack players in Tokyo you will take a lot of damage if you stay in Tokyo (that's why with big player counts, 2 players go to Tokyo to reduce the nr of players attacking those in Tokyo, but still you'll take lots of damage). Trying to roll 3 of a kind of numbers 1,2 or 3 is an easier way to get points without having to go to Tokyo. The problem is that if you roll Attack in your last roll, and a space in tokyo gets unoccupied, you'll have to go to Tokyo even if you'd rather not go.
CON: dificult to see other players health and victory points.

Something like "Roll through the ages" and "to court the king". The illustrations are great, and the gameplay supports the dice abilities and the push your luck element robustly. Wish the dice were smaller though so one could hold them easily in his hand. Simplicity is on the correct level- a bit less complicated and it would be stupid, a bit more and probably it would lose its fast style. A nice game!

Richard Garfield strikes back, after many years since his best designs (Magic, RoboRally and Netrunner)!

King of Tokyo is a very simple yatzee variant, with mathematic elegance that supports different patterns of "strategy" towards victory. And, more important: it is a GREAT FUN filler!! Being the King of the Hill (or of the city, in this case) and bullying the others is very thematic and introduces some light-hearted choices that make this dice game stand above the others...

Highly recommended, and I guess my daughters will enjoy it when they will grow up!

Quick competitive filler with player elimination, luck because of dice but has some strategy. Lost its luster as some games take way longer than expected.

Sold. Too luck dependent, player elimination and turtling can really drag on the game while people just watched, wanting the game to be over.

Ah!  Beautiful smashy wonderfully universally loved King of Tokyo!  I have played this more than any game hands down.  Most of my game group loves this, and my 80+ year old grandmother loves it.  She was disappointed when I didn't bring it to a family gathering!  It is light enough to be easy to understand, but offers just enough choices to make smacking monsters around so much fun!  And it is brilliant that there are multiple paths to victory in such a simple game because it helps it appeal to a lot of different people, I have found.  It isn't a deep game.  At all.  But it is really really hard to not get into the mood of it and just laugh when you die by the monster before you rolling 5 or 6 claws.  It is hard to be bitter at this game at all.  Just brilliant.

I really enjoy this basic king of the hill game. It's a risk taking game with fighting your friends and trying to be the last one standing (or normally the one who stays in Tokyo the longest). I'd like to get King of New York to add a little complexity and new options, but this game is fun.

wow. This game really is like the exciting version of Yahtzee. There is some strategy in your decision making but clearly there is a lot of luck. I typically look for games that rely little on luck but this one has a nice balance and I really liked it. Looking forward to more plays. Maybe even upgrading to the more strategy driven king of New York

Richard Garfield's version of Yathzee is a fun clash of the monster titans. Nice filler.
Increased the rating to 8, because after more then ten plays it's becomming clear that the simple rule of "all against the king of tokyo" is crucial here: This wonderful design of Richard Garfield prevents the "take that!" attitude and it also prevents kingmaking.

It's ok, but if it runs long, it runs too long.  Can't help but think it would benefit from a timer.  Once everyone gets reasonable support cards, the temptation to rock back and forth by being in and out of Tokyo means the end game can become interminable.  A shame, since the shorter games are great.

7/21/2015 - (I have owned this game for about one year and have played it around 20-30 times.)

I have never loved King of Tokyo until today! Today was my first time playing with the Power Up! expansion and it was VERY fun! King of Tokyo was just a good game, but it has turned into a great game for me because of the Power Up! expansion.

This will be my final written review for King of Tokyo the base game. All future reviews will be written under the Power Up! expansion or future expansions as I will never play King of Tokyo again without the Power Up! expansion. 

Furthermore, my rating for King of Tokyo will reflect the Base game AND the Power Up expansion for now. In the future, This rating will increase if more expansions are released as I always rate a board game based on using my optimal choices of expansions.

It's a dice-fest, but I think King of Tokyo is saved by the powerup cards you can buy. Those add a strategic element, and let you develop a strategy. It's a little expensive for what it is, but it's a great way to start a game night, and supports a large number of players.

UPDATE: Lowering my score slightly with this game because I just plain done think I will come back to it now that I have King of New York. KoNY has officially brought to light the biggest flaws of KoT.

2/17/2014: Hands down one of the best games for any level of gamer. Not only is it a solid game, it also makes for an excellent primer for more complex strategy or RPG based games. Add in the power up expansion and you even have unique powers for each player. If I were to pick a game to prepare gamers for things like Krosmaster Arena or Super Dungeon Explore or Zombicide, this would be it for sure.

UPDATE: This is still a favorite for me.  I have finally had the chance a few times to play with larger groups and it does change the game quite a bit.  I still enjoy a 2-player game but the 4 or more player games are far more intense and interesting.  I'd say 4 is about right, but even 6 players is not too hectic with the right group of people.  As always, games like this are best played with people who can laugh about trash talk and asshole moves.  I love this game and have no intention of ever lowering my score.

Love this game! It is a perfect mix of battle with a great dice mechanic. I've only played it twice and only 2-player. I'm betting it is even better with more people. I must have the expansion to this where the monsters have specialized power up cards.

One of the best light/family games on the market. Easy to explain, fast to play, cool and colorful design, tons of fun. If there is any flaw to this game it would be that the monsters in the basic game are only for looks. They differentiate in no way. Does not matter if you play King or Alienoid, they are just standees. That is beeing fixed with the first expansion but it is a flaw (atleast for me) if you have ony the basic game.

Silly, silly fun! Dice rolling, attacking your opponents, special abilities on cards you can purchase, all this leads to a really fun game. My only gripe with KOT is that there seems to really be only 1 way to win. That being to damage the other players to get rid of all of their health. I have attempted the victory point route numerous times, to no avail. If anyone has a good strategy to win via VP's, please let me know!

RATING: 8
You roll and reroll big, sexy dice to damage other monsters, heal your monster, earn energy to spend on cards that power up your monster, and to score victory points. The board is simple: If you are the King of Tokyo, your monster is on the board. All the monsters that are not the King of Tokyo are off the board.

A big roll can certainly determine the outcome of the game but mostly it's a back and forth battle. The key to the balance is that if you're the King of Tokyo, you get to damage all the monsters outside Tokyo and earn victory points for being King, and if you're not the King of Tokyo, you have the ability to heal. A monster will reign as King as long as it can to score victory points but eventually gets wounded enough that it has to relinquish its throne and heal. 

It's a fast-paced game that's quick to set up and quick to learn, great fun when there's a lot riding on a roll, and not too deep, making for light but exciting fare.

Thank god this game allows you to win through victory points, because the defensive cards turn the slugfest into a slogfest.

A fun, rather simple game that lets you push your luck in a number of directions, so there are strategies to be pursued, you just might not get the cooperation of the dice.  The cards which allow you to change facets of the game keep it fresh and keep you paying attention.

Getting knocked out early can be a drag because sometimes the game isn't quick, but usually it's fine.

I really liked it, but this had the same problem I had with Alien Frontiers:  Eventually you can't keep track of the 37 different player powers you and others have.  (This was with the "Power Up" expansion.)

Other than that, for being what someone called (and I agree) 'an exercise', it was a really fun exercise.  

It had wild point swings, super over-powered cards.  You get 2-3 bad rolls in a row, and you're hurtin'.  I don't want to say it's all luck, but a good roll will get you 1/5th of the way to the end of the game.  For the game length it definitely kept interest and had a fair deal of tactics.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great gateway game. I can't think of another game I have that is easier to teach and play than the King. 

The Power-Up expansion is nice if your gaming group plays this more than 10 times. The character choices become relevant and more thematic; plus - giant panda.

King of Tokyo is a wacky little yahtzee like game where players (monsters) attempt to score points and bash each others' brains out.

RATING: 7
Simple, fast and extremely fun.
Not many choices, but it's highly interactive and the theme is funny :)
Player elimination is not something I like, but this game lasts like 25 minutes, so it's not much of a problem. And oh, doesn't it feel great eliminating someone when they are high on points :arrrh:

My box contains:
-The base game
-Power Up!
-Halloween
-5 sets of dice (Original painted dice + Three sets of engraved dice + Orange Halloween Dice)

Great 3-4 player game. Good with 5. 6 players make the game a bit too slow (but still good) and 2 player games don't seem all that interesting.

So apparently, Richard Garfield was sitting around his mansion* thinking about Yahtzee.  "You know what would make Yahtzee great?" he said to himself.  "Freakin' GODZILLA."  And because he's Richard Garfield, he was right.  Fast-paced dice game of rampaging and monster-brawling, with a mutation/special event mechanism that gives it a lot of replay value.  Offers you enough meaningful decisions to prevent the strong luck-based elements from overwhelming the game.  Good times.

(* -- Successful game designers DO live in mansions, yes?)

This is one of the best fillers I've ever played. The game concepts are so simple that you can learn them in less than 5 minutes. But the fun you'll have playing this game is just unbelievable. The cards add the necessary spice and variety. Replay value is tremendous as I've yet to meet anybody who could stop after playing less than 3 games. Highly recommended to anybody who likes fun. If you don't: just move along, there's nothing to see here.

Who would have thought that you could get a great game about battling monsters with a simple Yahtzee-style dice mechanism. But don't let that scare you, because the only thing Yahtzee like about this game is the fact that you roll 3 times and save dice to accomplish your goals. The 2 goals make for some interesting gameplay because sometimes players become overly aggressive and try destroying their foes, while other times people become very defensive and shoot for points. But the true magic of this game are the mutation cards. It is so cool that you can buy special abilities and slowly adapt your monster into something unique. Each card you buy can slightly alter your strategies for the rest of the game, and I love that. This is a superb game that I'd recommend to anyone.

RATING: 7.75
It's a fun change of pace from the games I usually play. It still has opportunity for strategy, but is more satisfying as a push-your-luck dice chucking big monster brawling king of the hill thematic experience. It's also excellent for introducing new people to board gaming. It's highly accessible, with some depth of choices as to when to hold/leave Tokyo, when to try and heal vs attack, when to focus on hoarding energy, when to buy cards, and when to clear cards. It's humorous, over-the-top, monstrous fun. I prefer KoT with the Power Up! expansion. The evolutions add an interesting element of unique special bonuses. The player elimination in KoT is a bummer. Usually it doesn't happen too early, though, so it doesn't tend to drag on like some games *cough* Bang *cough*.

(I do have to add that I haven't really played KoT since getting King of New York, which is everything I love about KoT plus deeper decisions and more to do.)

A quick, fun and light game of yahtzee-like dice rolling while attacking other monsters.  It's fun to attack, heal, score point, collect energy to improve your monster and balance all of these in order to win the game.  You win by either destroying everyone else or scoring 20 points.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable game, fairly easy to learn and doesn't take long to play a game. It's not very exciting if there are only two players (the closer to 6 the better but at least 3 needed to make it interesting). The pieces and production are very high quality and the artwork is amusing. Perfect if you've got people to play with who don't mind some vindictiveness ;)

Card and Dice game with victory point mechanism. 

As a "fearsome" monsters you'd like to destroy Tokyo or - if necessary... or suitable - your fellow monsters.
Through dice rolls you get victory points, regain health, hurt other monsters or collect energy. 
The latter helps you to "buy" special abilities or more victory points and brings you closer to your goal: To rule over Tokyo!

The mechanism is simple: You are either in Tokyo and if not you might want to go there; be it only to shoo other monsters away from YOUR Tokyo.

One of my familie's favourite game. 
(playtime for 4+ players: 30 to 60 min)

RATING: 9.3
A light mega-monster themed yahtzee-type dice game.  Players choose their monsters and roll dice (3 rolls, keeping dice which they choose) to attack each other, accrue energy (for cards which improve their monster / abilities).  There is player elimination but non-serious theme and quick play time (approx. 30 minutes) makes this a non-issue.  Great for kids and adults.  Need at least three people to play unless you want to insert a "dummy monster player" to play with two (i.e. non-official variant where you add a non-player monster to roll and keep life and attack for monster outside of tokyo on his/her turn).  I have gotten enough use out of this game.

Let's call it what it is -- a more thematic, fun, and light-hearted Yahtzee.  I've enjoyed every game I've ever played.  At the same time, I don't feel a strong desire to play it often.  However, it is great for family gatherings or game nights with very casual players.

RATING: 8
Quick fun at 3-5 players. Chucking those chunky dice feels real good and the odds all feel balanced. The actions are specific enough where when I'm not able to do a move because the dice roll wrong, usually I at least have some other action to complete. Rarely is there a turn where I can do nothing. And that feels good.

This is a classic, evergreen, gateway game. Players roll dice yahtzee style to either gain points, do damage, heal, or gain energy to use on power up cards. If you are in tokyo, you get more points, but can't heal and are the target of other players attacks.

While I personally like the sequel, king of new york, better, this is played more purely because it is simpler and easier to teach.

I love to roll my dice, so King of Tokyo was a game I couldn’t miss trying, yet I’m still undecided about it. Don’t get me wrong, I like it: I just can’t get all that excited about its theme, since I don’t like big ravaging monsters nor Far-Eastern science fiction B-movies. 
Which means everything this game is about.

Anyhow, even though its theme leaves me pretty cold, I think King of Tokyo is fun to play, since it’s light, fast and dice-heavy. (March 2012)

[b]Update[/b] - After further playing King of Tokyo I’ve started to enjoy it despite its unattractive theme: as a matter of fact when everyone tries to hit hard it rocks! Sadly though some players still care for just grinding victory points rather than crushing their opponents, which makes the game a bit dull as it deprives it of its main source of fun.

Anyway, in July 2013 I raised my rating from 6 to 8 as it makes for lots of sparkles.

Érdekes egy játék. Valójában kellemes meglepetés, de mégis úgy érzem semmivel sem több egy szerencsejátéknál azaz egy kockapókernél. Fogalmazhatok úgy, hogy egy kockapóker kibővítése egy tematikával és némi célirányú döntésekkel. Az akciókártyák némi képen adnak valamiféle stratégiát, de némelyik kártya egy vicc. Egy példa: 8-ért vehetek egy kártyát, melyet ha eldobok kilencem lesz. Szóval nem mondanám, hogy egy társasággal nem ülök le vele játszani, de hogy a polcomat nem érdemli meg az biztos. Még remélem kipróbálhatom a kiegészítővel is. A kockák minősége kriminális. Dobhatatlan ormótlan . Értem én, hogy a szörny méretek érzését szerették volna kelteni, de szerintem használhatatlan. Egy dobótálcát mindenképen érdemes használni hozzá.

I like this game a lot. I've just bought it yesterday and played it twice. The game is easy to learn and play time is quick. 
The rules seem easy to learn but the strategy is too complex for my six year old to understand.

Fun, fun, fun light King of the Hill game. Love the crazy amount of cheese included in the game. The art and theme really add to the game. All the card abilities are cool and dice and board are perfect for this game. Can't get enough of this one right now. Everyone spends the whole time laughing, pointing, slapping their thighs, etc. Loads of fun!

2011, 2-6p.

Others say: 30 minute filler, "take that", dicefest, "king of the mountain" game.  You can take the target on/off your back by entering/leaving Tokyo.  Balanced in terms of having several options to go for (points, health, attacks).  Probably better with a few variants (more energy, starting powers, etc.).

Stven says: The game achieves its goals, but they are boring goals.

RATING: 9
This might be my favorite filler. More than any other filler in my collection it seems to match weight and play time with the silly, fun theme. The decisions are not only interesting, they're entertaining. Does the giant robotic bunny blast the monstrous radiated lizard out of Tokyo...or does the giant robotic bunny elect to grow another head?!? I like 7 Wonders and Colossal Arena very much, but there is a certain distance that one has from the way the mechanics interact with the theme; it's also hard for the short playtimes to establish much of an investment. That's why the term "filler" is so often appropriate not as a criticism but as a sober acknowledgment of the limitations of a shorter game. With King of Tokyo, though, you just find yourself rooting for your monster. "Go Giant Robotic Bunny! Use your carrot death ray!" It's the board game equivalent of a mash up of "Rock'em, Sock'em Robots" and Sunday afternoon Japanese monster movie features. It's not too serious and is the perfect game to squeeze in between heavier courses or for the end of an evening.

This game has been a hit with every group I have played it with. The most fun "Take That!" game I have played.

RATING: 9
The best fun you can have with your clothes on, although I suspect it's pretty good fun without them too. To shine, you need to get into the spirit of the game, badmouthing your opponents and bragging about your powers. The mechanics are wedded blissfully to a wonderful theme which is captured perfectly in the magnificent artwork - some of the art on the cards is brilliant. There is a real game underneath all the glitter though, and there are some tough choices, some push-your-luck (how long can you last in Tokyo) and lots of interaction with the other monsters, I mean players. Already one of my all-time favourites. Buy it and love it!

My initial thought was a basic Dice game. In which I got beat like 6 times in a row by my 6 year old daughter who keep Tokyo everytime. I felt maybe first player had the advantage. Well I have change my rating from a 7 to an 8 as there are various ways to win. It's a great game and it's fun and a great kids and adult game. Plenty to think about. Look it's not a worker placement or too thought provoking game. It's fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A fun and light-hearted dice rolling game about giant monsters battling in a city.  Great flavor, a ton of fun and a great game for new games and kids to get into gaming with.  Despite that there is enough to the design that you can strategize, and enough variance from the dice and cards that anyone can win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
2 plays:

Light and quick but compelling. Kids like it, and can play it, but it has enough tricky decisions to sustain attention from more sophisticated gamers. Takes absolutely no setup and really doesn't even require much explanation to new players. Works with as few as two players or as many as six.. I wish the power up cards were more consistently interesting, though; gameplay doesn't seem to get beyond a thin level of depth. Still, very satisfying and with excellently designed components.

Doesn't work well for two. Need at least three players, best with 4+.

Has become less interesting over time. Many games I would rather play. Lacks complexity - in a word, I find it a little "boring." Can't totally put my finger on exactly why.

Nice game to pull out for non-gamers who are familiar with other dice games like Yahtzee - basically a nice gateway.

Don't like the player elimination - not a big deal, just not my thing.

This game is absolutely brilliant.  As simple as this game is, it is still so fun.  Yahtzee on big, hairy, scaly steroids.  Push your luck with dice.  Can not wait to get the expansions although they are very unnecessary.   It plays out so quickly one game will never be enough.  Could be used as a filler, but like I mentioned you may end up playing this for 2 hours.  Great game for all ages.  Light but fun.

RATING: 10
King of Tokyo does what few games have ever done...make a fun game that can be taught in 3-5 minutes yet has enough depth to satisfy the regular gamer. I have literally tried this game with all types of different groups, including sure fire non-gamers and usually disinterested family members, and not one person has walked away with bad things to say about the experience. 

In fact, the experience alone has been enough to get several others to buy the game. If that's not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is. Best game of 2012 in this household, even if it is completely silly monster smashing and dice rolling!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Didn't think I'd like this - but I do! Sure it's a yahtzee type game, but I quite like that genre. Definitely worth checking out if you like Monsters Menance America - similar game flavour in about a quarter of the game time.

** Update, not good with 2, and not much better with 3. and with 6 you could be almost dead before you get a turn! But great with 4 or 5 ...

Totally over-produced, and the board is totally superflous, but it does help with the theme :)

King of Tokyo is a dice-based simple combat game. It is fun for playing with non-gamers, but wouldn't be something I would greatly look forward to. Players take on the role of monsters and try to score points by occupying Tokyo without getting killed. There are also power-ups that can be bought in the game but, in my plays, the game usually ends before these become relevant.

The expectation that this was a good filler was filled, but we didn't have but three players, so I don't expect we had the full impact of the experience. So far I feel this to be a step above Yahtzee, which is an Ok push your luck game. UPDATE: Played with 5 players and think it has more meaning with additional players making it harder to want your monster to stay in Tokyo. Raised a half point for the 4 or more player game.

It's not a surprise that this game was designed by Richard Garfield, because it's freaking awesome! At first glance, it's just a simple, Dakaiju-themed party game. However, after your first game, you'll realize that it does have a little bit of depth to it. That small amount of strategy is actually what sets this apart from all of the other hyper-light party games out there, and it's also why you and your group will keep coming back for more monster smashing action.

VERDICT:

As an ameritrash lover, I have to dig the fact that I'm a gigantic monster, terrorizing Tokyo. I'm also looking forward to playing the expansions.

Can be pretty fun, even for adults, but also can be kind of boring.  Really depends on the group. Best with 4 I think.

Keeping this for school game club. Kids will love this.

** Update: Kids do love this. The art is really appealing and entertaining.  Some cards are hard for kids to understand, but there's so many they can just re-draw. I donated this game to the school.  I will probably buy it again because it is definitely worth owning.

This is fairly fun, but somehow not quite as fun as I'd hoped. Utterly worthwhile to play with the kids, but there's just something missing. I think it's differentiation for the monsters - the expansion with the 'evolutions' probably really helps with this.

King of Tokyo never dissappoints when it hits the table. I love the power up expansion but since this is a game I'm often teaching to new players, I don't get to "power up" as often as I'd like. When I'm with experienced players, I typically choose a more weighty game.

Yahtzee as a non-party-party-game.
You have some big dice, roll and reroll them and see what you get.
Some points? Victory here I come.
Some hearts? These let you heal up.
Some energy? Let's you buy cool stuff.
Or you get some claws and beat your enemies down.

King of Tokyo is a great game to start / end a game night with something light and fun. But that's it.
Ohkay, you have the urge to play a second round...
...but after that you are done with the game very quickly.

It's good as a filler or a small party game.

There's a bit of everything in this one.. dice, tradeoffs between points and health, push your luck, taking risks, multiple paths to victory.  It's actually all quite well done.  I like the monster cutouts too.   Initial rating a 7.

Después de unas partidas algo dudosas creo que el juego ha mejorado (aunque depende del grupo) cuando generas algo de pique. Tirar dados y dar porrazos con una sobreproducción que le da un aspecto muy espectacular en mesa. Lo única pega es que falta algo más de profundidad pero vamos, no es un juego cuyo objetivo sea comerte la cabeza. Supongo que le añadiré la expansión a ver si llena este hueco.

[b]King of Tokyo[/b] is a dice rolling game with similar mechanics to [i]Yatzee[/i], with player interaction, hit points, special powers and one time effects, but is much better than [i]Yatzee[/i].  The theme is great, and the components look good too.

However, KoT is one of those games that come in a way too large of a box.  I guess they want us to think that $50 is a reasonable price for this game.

Raucous fun, but this is not the Holy Grail of dice games that everyone makes it out to be. The theme has a lot going for it, and the special powers are funny and fun to play. In our games going for victory points is just stupid because everyone dies before they can achieve that win condition. Healing proves to be far more useful. Just don't die before everyone else does and you'll be fine!

RATING: 5
I've probably played this 15-20 times, and with every play I like it less and less.

The short pitch is "It's like yahtzee, but you're all monsters trying to kill each other".  That's fine, as far as it goes.  But the game tends to drag on for quite a while, and the turns very rarely involve interesting decisions.  You just roll the dice and see what you get - there isn't enough wiggle room to actually try for different strategies.

Not that much to this game when you get down to it but it has that essential fun factor which lifts it beyond what you might expect.  The rules are very simple, but it's worth highlighting the "you can't heal in Tokyo" rule - which is what makes the game (as it forces you to chose between death and glory and, very cleverly, drives the game on to a conclusion).  And, even though it's an elimination game, it's short enough for that not to be a real problem. Rating up a notch after another couple of plays, which is always a good sign.

My brother owns it. It's a fun game for sure. Relatively quick game with very easy set up. The only thing I would change is that I wish the different monsters had something that made them distinct. I know the trait cards add distinctions, but it would be fun if each monster had a starting ability or something. As it stands, each monster is a clone of the others except in the cardboard cutout and name.

While there is a fun little dice rolling game here, this is really a case of the components making the game.  Sure, you get to make a couple decisions about rolling dice, but the game has sweet cardboard monsters, score trackers, energy cubes, and beautifully illustrated cards (and a LOT of them too!).

Basically, you're trying to score points in King of Tokyo through rolling some numbers on the dice, using your energy on cards that let you do special stuff, or bashing on Tokyo, where you get points for hanging out.  The problem with hanging out in Tokyo is that, even though you score more points, you get bashed by all the other monsters!  You can also lose by taking too much damage, so carefully choosing your shots is important.

Overall, if you're simply into the mechanics of a game, you probably won't be incredibly excited.  However, if you can appreciate a great application of theme and be swayed by cool components, try this one out!

This game is cool. One of the best player elimination games for sure. Quick, fun, easy to learn (although effects of some cards are not well enough explained in the rulebook). Randomness could be pain in the ass sometimes, but game is so fun, that it doesn't bother much. Give it a try, you probably will not be disappointed, even if you don't like negative interaction and player elimination (like I do). 2 player game makes no sense, 3 is ok, 4 & up to 6 is best.

The game is random random random, but as long as everyone plays super aggressively (such that the stars are an oft-forgotten after thought), it's fun.

If everyone plays to passively, trying to build the most powerful monsters possible through energy, or trying to win with stars, then the game can last a really long time and the player elimination is a huge downside (I've had someone get eliminated and fall asleep before the game was finished).

Nice Yahtzee update. The flavor of this game is fun, and it's nice that you actually do have to think somewhat about when to leave Tokyo and when to attack the player in it.

There is one card however I intensely dislike. -5 VP for all other players? That does nothing but draw out the length of the game. Blech.

This is an early rating of 10, however in just a few sessions I have played this game nearly 10 times. And I am amazed at how good this game is. You have to understand what type of game you are going to play if you want to judge it correctly, however just look at the components and you should have a good idea.
If you try and turn this into a number game and strategicaly plan out each move to get the most points, then you are completely misssing the boat. It's a monster mash game, with hidden depth but simple enough to play with the kids and just have fun.

I really like the idea/feel of this game but the execution lacked.  

2 player version is broken.  Whoever gets tokyo first (i.e. first player) will almost always win.  We played 4 games and never got more than 2 cards bought and never won with victory points.  Games are so quick and luck-based that it's hard to have any strategy other than attack nonstop and hope you roll better than your opponent.

The cards are pretty cool and gameplay is fun.  Will try again with some choice house rules to see if that fixes the problems.

I want to check out New York, I've heard it fixes a lot of the issues I have with this one.

King of Tokyo is a fast-paced light dice rolling filler game. There is a fair amount of luck involved because of the dice rolls, but you can re-roll them twice so it isn't a huge issue. 

KoT is one of the big hits on BGG. However, I fail to see the fun. To me, the game is very boring, and no, it's not because I don't play it with the right group; I've played with my family, close friends and other friends, and every time I have felt the game was lacking. It just isn't that much fun to attack the other players' monsters in or outside Tokyo, and it just isn't that much fun to score some VPs here and there. 

The cards you can buy help to keep the game fresh, but it also increases the downtime. 
I also feel like it takes too long to actually finish the game even though it's a filler; 30 minutes is way too long for the amount of decisions you face in this game! Heck, even 20 minutes is too long. I don't find it interesting to roll dice and attack a little and get some energy cubes and some VPs.

All in all, King of Tokyo is way, way overrated imho.

In all honesty this game is not a deep game, and it has lots of luck, and some people might not like it because of the player elimination, but even with all that said I still find it a fun filler to start or end an evening of gaming. I don't mind the player elimination in this game because it's not a long or deep game. It's a geeky Yahtzee game. To me, it's a classic game that I need in my collection because it doesn't require much thought and is fun to play.

RATING: 8
Yeah, dice!

But not "roll and move" dice.  Not "sequence usage" dice.  Not "worker placement" dice.  And not really "battle" dice in the traditional sense.

Instead, a nice usage of dice that allow you flexibility in your choices, with a bit of "damage" to opponents, and other opportunities to become "king of the hill".

I think this game is ok, but way overplayed. I simply couldn't keep it anymore. It's yatzee with a new theme pasted on. Sure it's fun but it is a bit childish when I get it out and I don't feel like it goes over well with most people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The game is very straight-forward and only takes minutes to learn and understand.  I would definitely recommend it for more than 2 players, however, since a 2-player game just becomes an 'attack-fest' to see who can roll the most attack die first.

Really amusing filler game.  Roll 6 dice with two re-rolls and you either get points, attack, or get money depending on what you roll. Either be last man standing or be the fist to get to 20 points, and you are done in under 30 minutes.  Very nice.  --Also, as an honorable mention, the Art in this game awesome.

Giant monster game, at a smaller cost than monpoc and shorter play time than MMA.  Not really the same type of game at all, either, but still more accessible.

[b]Also includes the promo King of Tokyo cards.[/b]

King of Tokyo is the perfect game for when you want something quick that involves chucking gobs of dice. It's admittedly pretty light, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun. Unlike Yahtzee which is totally solitaire, KoT does encourage you to see what the other players are doing so you can apply pressure accordingly. And that "king of the hill" in the middle allows you to get extra VPs at the expense of putting a target on your back.

The sheer diversity of cards is impressive, and the artwork is very humorous. I love the theme, and it adds to the charm. My one knock is that I wish each character had something to differentiate the abilities. The different monsters are just window dressing, but everyone still picks a favorite.

A lot of fun, but even as a light game, had other players get upset from being eliminated. Simple with high luck, but has good strategy elements (Victory Point win, K.O. win, Energy Points to facilitate either quick at the end).  Best strategy to have is to roll with the dice (if victory Points are rolled go with them, if damage is caused go that way, if energy is excessive take that route).  Also avoid being the first into Tokyo.

You really need the right group for this one! Played with a pack of geeks, it can get crazy fun quickly. I played this with the family too though and the whole "monsters" theme lacked appeal, which made clear that the game mechanics behind the blingbling are actually not that engaging. Several family-members said they didn't really get why I liked it that much. A fair critique I think... Also: too expensive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
"Godzilla Yahtzee" in short.  You can try to score points by controlling Tokyo or simply destroy the other monsters but keep your health up or you'll be eliminated.  There are cards you can purchase in the game to give you extra options and scoring opportunities as well.  The monsters look cool but have nothing mechanically unique about them which is neither particularly good nor bad, just bland, I suppose.  I prefer games without player elimination to keep everyone involved until the end, but the game doesn't go that long for it to be a problem.

Simple, fun, and always entertaining. It's Kaiju Yahtzee with some minimal strategy bolted on, but laughter always ensues. There's enough here for gamers and it's simple enough for non-gamers to grasp within minutes. Brilliant.

I requested this for Christmas (above several other games that I had previously been more interested in) after all of the stellar reviews I read/heard about it and the quick play. I'm so glad I did ask for it, because it is a great game.

It has a relatively small footprint too, my boyfriend and I played it over and over in hospital on the small tables that they give you to eat your food. It was a great laugh, and didn't strain the mind when I was feeling quite run down from meds. It is not so portable that I would take it tramping (hiking) but you could take it if you just took the cards and the die but without the monsters it just wouldn't be the same.

We've also played this at BBQs (when there aren't too many people) and although sometimes the game lasted more like 50mins than 30mins it was still hilarious.

It is easy to teach, not too serious and plays quickly so it is easy to get others to play, and can be played with many different groups of people.

Yahtzee plus king of the hill with monsters equals a great game that is accessible to most - if not all - levels of gamers.  Although all dice games have luck involved, the different decisions you must make and options you have - especially with the Power Up! expansion - satisfies one's want of strategy. My group is careful not to play it too much though, as I could see one getting burnt out on it.

King of Tokyo is a game that you can bring out with all crowds. My mom even enjoyed it and she's the type of person who has only played Yahtzee (which is comparable) and Aggravation.

Love this game and I can't believe I found this for $1 at the thrift store!

Every once in a while, this one overstays its welcome. I think this tends to happen when the groupthink tends toward passive (not attacking each other) play. But if you're behind, it makes less sense to go for a points strategy. 

However, its really fun...and the theme integrates well. Its been very well received locally, with a couple vocal exceptions. Its a game I enjoy owning and playing. Looking forward to keeping it in the rotation as a filler.

RATING: 6
(New edition)

This is harmless, dice-rolling fun with a bit of a monster flavour paste job on top of it. It is only sort of a board game, as the board is only used to show whether players are in the Tokyo zone, or in the "not in Tokyo" zone. All of the monsters are identical but for the theme gloss, that said, don't try to take my Space Penguin away from me or there will be consequences.

The game is primarily about trying to roll sets of like dice using a pool of 6, 6-sided dice ala Yahtzee. You want sets of 3 for the VPs to score, whereas the lightning bolts power up your guy, the hearts heal him, and the claws allow you to deal damage to the players who are in the zone opposite of yours.

The victory mechanism is multi-faceted in that you can try to just go after VPs straight up (mostly by rolling number sets or occupying Tokyo by beating on the current monster there enough to make them want to leave) or you can try to get aggressive and knock the other players out instead. This second option seems to primarily be included as a potential way for people to catch up against a leader with a strong early VP lead.

The only real additional gloss on this game is the power cards. These are cute, and you only see a few of them each game so the mix should add some long term variety to the play. The downside, however, is that the cards are fairly pricey and the game is so short that it's hard to get full use out of them in some cases.

Anyway, it's nothing absolutely amazing, but it's charming filler and one that I am glad to have around in my collection. I would have liked a bit of a tweak to the cards, as I do think they don't come into play quite as much as I would like (as they do add variety) but overall it's hard to fault it. Short and fun.

My kids (6 y.o. and 4 y.o.) really enjoy this game. Of course, they require a bit of guidance for the strategy. Still, they get the "attack at all costs" strategy and use it pretty effectively. The game, luckily, allows for other paths to victory, so their success rate is only 50-50 or so.

I'm completely "meh" on the game. I get that it is silly fun, but it doesn't feel terribly fun or strategic. It feels like I'm playing it to satisfy my girls. So that's completely worth it, but I wouldn't pull this game out for my friends.

Amazingly a big flop with my non gamer crowd - they now look at me with scorn and expressions suggesting loser (at least I didn't notice this before playing!). So much for all the hype. Possibly too much luck and yahtzee like for comfort.

It is a game what makes us laugh. Amazing for a short game between big games or beginning a game night with almost zero setup time.

After some time this game dropped a bit in our group. We prefer many other short games over this nowadays.

- one of the best filler games out there

Con:
- for some people: player elimination (no big deal because short playlength)
- often ended in 1v1 duels at the end which are not as entertaining

I don't get why so many people like this game. I think I'd like it more if the monster abilities saw more play, but the game almost always ends before anyone is able to do much with them. I'm also not crazy about players being eliminated and sitting out the remainder of the game.

RATING: 8.5
This game can have some rather explosive and crazy endings.  With all the abilities of the cards stacking people begin to dish out a ton of damage in a hurry or they make a quick and massive grab of points.  One good thing about it is until that flurry happens you're always in the game and it could be you that gets the roll or the card that swings the tide of the match.  It's about 75:25 luck vs skill.  Finally, the energy cards are well thought out and offer a lot of variety which will give this game a lot of longevity.  It's a very good 10-30 min game (number of players and style of play determines length of game).

Simple and entertaining dice rolling game. Appropriate complexity for the length of time you play and the target audience and great push-your-luck implementation.

Battle Yahtzee! 

Another game that almost everyone we've played with ends up loving. It's a little more complicated than some gateway games, but I'd still feel comfortable bringing out KoT for people who enjoy Yahtzee and haven't played much else. I recently taught it to some pre-teen boys. They got most of the rules without too many problems. All 3 of them were dying to play again. 

This is another that we played so many times and lately haven't played much at all. It still fills a space that I don't think any other game quite fills for me.

I play at least once a week with my kids (ages 5 & 7 as of this writing); the older kid does great, while the younger mainly just wants to roll the dice, but both are engaged.  That said, the game doesn't suffer when playing with adults.  It's also a decent drop-in/out party game.

Ez az a játék, amit az 5 éves lányom ugyanúgy szeret, mint a 40 évvel idősebb vendégünk, akivel épp együtt játszunk. Könnyen tanítható, kezdőkkel ideális, mondhatni gateway játék. A megvásárolható kártyák variációi miatt nincs két egyforma játék. Aki kiesik, az kiesett, de jó eséllyel nem ül sokáig tétlen: talán ha egyszer volt egy olyan 5 fős játékunk, ami másfél órán át húzódott, de nem sikerült többször ilyen maratoni játszmát rendezni.

The very first time I played King of Tokyo I fear I made myself look a bit like nerdy Sheldon for not wanting to continue a statistically completely lost position (meaning I'd end up second, not a bad result for sure). Well, my opponents retorted, isn't it cool that you then win through sheer luck??! No, I replied, that's just dumb, as rolling beter is not really an achievement I want to rely on. And so I proclaimed the other player the deserved #1 (she had a wonderful combo lying in front of her), and we went on playing a different game. After that I did not expect to play King of Tokyo anymore, but a friend of mine bought it, and 'made' me play. To my bemusement, and the other players' annoyance, I found I'm quite good at it, finishing first or second nearly every time. So when I'm challenged again, I always mockingly joke that the players [i]must[/i] have a thing for masochism, seeing that they enjoy being beaten up so thoroughly every time. This infuriates them to the point of taking too many risks, and me beating the crap out of them once more. 

Game-technically King of Tokyo is of course just another Yahtzee-clone, spiced up with fictional Big Monster artwork. Poor Tokyo is just backdrop; and to be honest, once the game is done, I'm not sure there'd be much of the city left to crown the victor 'King of Tokyo'. It's 'King of What Is Left of Tokyo', I fear. There isn't much to talk about it, save, perhaps, the player elimination. The game is short enough that it can be stomached, although it is pushing matters in the 6 player-game. Apart from that, relax, and eat radioactive dice attack!

The most successful gateway game in my collection, King of Tokyo has attracted non-gamers to sit down at the table and play time after time. With various strategies to consider, yet an ease of access that few games possess, the game is the perfect blend of inclusiveness, luck, competition and decision-making. It’s light-weight and (at times) luck-driven, which may not be to everyone’s taste, but desperately deserves a place in almost every gamer's collection, especially those trying to bring new friends into the hobby.

This dice rolling game is ingenious in its simplicity - one of my favorite traits in a new game.  All you do on your turn is a typical Yahtzee-style role of several dice 3 times, setting aside those you want to keep.  You can score points with sets, attack other players' monsters, heal yourself, or gain energy.  Those energy points get you handy cards to make your character more powerful.

Throwing in a "king of the hill" mechanism, you weigh the risk vs. reward by staying in Tokyo, knowing you can attack all other players but leaving yourself vulnerable.

It's so fast, so easy to learn, I'm just sorry I hadn't played it sooner.  For fans of light, quick games that are fun for the whole family, this game is a home run.

Yahtzee with Monsters? So much more to offer than Yahtzee though. Great art and theme, dice are just cool. works ok with 2 but shines more with 3 or more. Power up pack is almost essential. if you buy the base game get the power up pack as well. it adds more interesting game play. You have cards to buy and energy to obtain and or course monsters to attack. Great for a younger crowd, I have played with kids as young as 5. They really like the monster theme. With a crowd that isn't willing to gamble by staying in Tokyo it can tend to be a bit of a drag and have a run away leader. The Power up gives it more depth and keeps it more interesting even in these situations.

Only two downsides I saw were: 1. The potential for early player elimination; and 2. The "destruction points" from rolling triple-numbers feel sadly sterile... but I can see how including little cardboard skyscrapers to topple would have blown out their price-point. :)

RATING: 5
Components: Cool art on the power-up cards. Fun dice. The VP and health windows on the player boards should be large enough to see from across the table, and should be less prone to accidental changes. The power-up cards are a bit difficult to read from across the table.

Experience: Very chaotic. Huge swings of bad luck can eliminate a player early on, who must then wait up to 20 minutes before the game ends, which isn't any fun.

It's a blast when played with the right group, one that gets into role-playing their monsters and doesn't take it too seriously. If the group isn't into the theme though, it will fall flat. Gameplay and strategy just isn't very deep or compelling otherwise. I prefer to play it with 4-6 players. Player elimination stinks. If you're knocked out early in the game, it's not fun having to watch everyone else play. King of New York is just a much improved and more interesting version of this game.

I like the idea of this game, art is fun, components are quality, just not enough choices for my liking.  Yes you choose when to stop rolling dice, who to attack, try for damage or healing.  Fun game, will always play, but too random for me to suggest it for play hence the lower rating.

RATING: 4
PLAY ONLY with variants that lower VPs to improve winning by VP (not deaths) and speed play. Also start with 1 chosen power card (out of 5). Slow games suck for dead players.
Remove cards that lower VP (i.e.-High Altitude Bombardment)
Still- player elimination may turn you off completely. Must play more.  AND IT HAS-RATING DROPPED.

Simple yet cool dice game with monsters. Cards add a bit of options. Evolution cards in expansion add even more interesting options.

RATING: 8
Opening the box, I felt like a kid unwrapping the best Christmas present ever.  The artwork was so cool and the concepts were so fun.  The first couple plays were really cool and tickled my childish funny bone.  However, the more games I've played, I actually don't know if it's much improved over Yahtzee.  The game is about 80% luck, and whenever one person starts running away with points, there is no real catching up.  Games sort of end anticlimactically.  I love the powerup abilities, but the games are usually nearly over before they seem to come into play.  I feel like the rules could be altered to come up with an even better game.

Initial rating is a 9. Why did I give such a simple game this high a rating? Because it's so much FUN! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game! It's getting a ton of play time right now. Due to this game's high fun factor, quick playing time, ease of rules explanation, and excellent artwork, this has to be one of the best games in my collection. I can play this with anyone. Everyone I have played it with has absolutely loved it. When we get done playing, everyone is always asking for one more game. I don't see myself ever getting tired of it. I love it and can't wait to see if they produce more goodness for this in the future. The game is perfect by itself, but I highly recommend getting the promo cards from the BGG store. They're not necessary for the game to be great, but I'd still say they're a must-have because of how awesome some of them are.

Update: This is going to a 10. I just love this game!

RATING: 8
Last year, I had the opportunity to play this many times with kids.  Player count fell between 3 of us and 6 of us.  We only played the base game, and later added a custom dice expansion.  Either way, they revived the game overall for me, and continue to keep it strong.

Old Comment:
After playing the base game MANY times, I only pulled this out for reluctant or new gamers.  However, since adding the Power Up expansion, I will play this game any time.  As such, knowing you have access to particular strategies, based upon the combination of evolution cards that you may acquire, adds a strategic element that is completely absent from the base game.  I don't ever want to play just the base game anymore, unless I'm teaching multiple new players.  Rating increased from 7 to 8 with the Power Up expansion added.

Older Comments:
Quick, fun, and appealing to many different tastes.  My wife won her first play against me, and I had 6 plays under my belt already.  Her response when she won:  "Whoa, that was fast.  That was fun!"

'nuf said.

...though it never goes very fast at player max, rather a bit longer than I think it should.  That may have something to do with the fact that I always seem to be teaching someone new how to play it...

This game's high rating is completely baffling.  Re-theme yahtzee, add bonus cards, tweak a few rules, and suddenly you have King of Tokyo.

This game always delivers a great time. Doesn't take too long to play most times. There is plenty to do in game, From attacking, buying cards, gathering energy or trying to hide and heal. I will never turn down a game of this, it is always welcome at my table. I've yet to play with power-ups either. 

Having said that I have yet to play its new form in King of New York. I have heard there is more to do, which may draw out the length a little, or may cause monsters to die quicker. I will reserve judgement. Though I can't see New York replacing Tokyo. Especially if your going to play with a younger crowd, wives, or even newer players. It sounds like Tokyo will remain a lighter option.

Pacific Rim, the game.

Fantastic theme and implementation, but I wish each kaiju had base powers to differentiate them.  Also, players turtling up and healing can drag the game out, so best to play with a crowd who'll get into the fighting spirit.

RATING: 5
Have played this a number of times. It is fun. People will laugh and enjoy it. For the most part. However there are some aspects to it that take away significant points:

It is an elimination game where players can be kicked out of the game fairly early on. No fun. It is a game with victory points, where, well, elimination can work just as well. It is like it was designed to serve two masters and it compromised.

The mechanics are a little too simple to make this game endure for me.

RATING: 7.5
Fun little game for 2-6 players. Every turn you throw 6 dice which can result in hitting your opponents, healing yourself, scoring points or gathering energy cubes, which can be used to purchase cards with special powers. As there can only be one monster occupying Tokyo, and the one actually occupying Tokyo cannot heal himself, there's a lot of jumping into and out of the city. When you're the last monster standing or have gained 20 points you win the game.

I've played a couple of 2, 3 and 4-player games so far, these were a lot of fun and so far have only resulted in eliminations. Will certainly play again.

King of Tokyo is a light beat-em-up that is fun for a group of friends.  The rules are fast & easy, so it's straight to the fun.  The theme is carried through very well to the cards, which have a lot of unique special players abilities.  Good filler, or party game.

Excellent little lightweight dice-rolling game with a healthy dose of push your luck ("if I stay in Tokyo one more round I will win on victory points, but can I survive another round of incoming monster attacks..."). 

The rules are short and easy to learn but the game is a lot of fun and plays very fast. We have yet to get a lot out of the purchasing mechanic but maybe that's because the wrong combination of energy/cards came up for us, it seems like that would be the most difficult path to victory (since you'd still need to then aim for a VP or knockout victory while playing catch-up to the monsters who had been focusing on those tactics already).

All the artwork is fantastic, very cartoony, the components are good quality, the dice are big and chunky (if anything maybe a little too big, which is not a criticism often levelled at dice, but might be a consideration I guess if you're playing with kids etc).

When I played with 6 players my first rating was a 4 but I recently played with 3 players and the game was actually fun. I think the difference was that with so many players I usually ended getting side damage from everyone, by the time it got to my turn I was already dead with no chance of recovery.

Update: Played a few more times and enjoyed it more. The only reason I might get it is to play with more casual friends

From the brilliant gaming mind of Magic: The Gathering creator Richard Garfield, King of Tokyo is a kaiju free-for-all game to see which kaiju monster will become the games namesake. With combat, strategy, and tons of customization with expansions and add-ons this game has tons of replay value. I unfortunately only have the base game but even then the base game is tons of fun to play. If you love the Magic: The Gathering card game I feel you will love King of Tokyo.

+Power Up expansion,+promo cards,+Brockenbar

Have only played it a few times and I'm already in love: Yahtzee-style dice done right. Even my wife, who hates confrontational games - although she's made great strides in her efforts to play them - likes this one as well. 

Update: With more plays under my belt, I can tell this is the sort of game that will work with just about any crowd. Granted, having some familiarity with the cards will reveal preferable strategies over others, so first-timers/non-gamers might not figure out quickly enough what cards should be acquired unless it's pointed out to them. 

The game is at its best with quick play and lots of banter. This should especially be encouraged when playing with 5 or 6 because the game can start to drag if people become indecisive over what to go for in their rolls or how to allocate their dice. This seems to be less of an issue when playing with three or four. Treat it as a light, fun, fast filler and you'll want to play it several times in a row. Playing it thoughtfully with a Min/Max approach will kill the pace and the mood.

Each player chooses a monster in this "king of the hill" style battle royale. Player with most VP at end of game or last one standing becomes king of Tokyo. Only one person can be in Tokyo at a time and collects VP every round for free, but cannot heal, so don't stay too long! Your actions for a turn are decided by rolling six (6-sided) dice yahtzee style. Choose to go for sets of three (1,2,3) for VP, (4) whack your opponent, (5) collect energy to upgrade your monster, or (6) heal (if not in Tokyo!). Fun simple push your luck player interaction.

Great family and gateway game into modern board games. The components are decent though the dice can be a bit chipped. Hardly an issue since it is a fun big dice chucking game. For me the newness has worn off and the depth isn't there to keep me coming back unless there are new gamers to introduce it to.

Fallen rather far for me due to the lack of interesting decisions in the game. Too light to hold my interest beyond being a gateway game.

2015:Only keeping it for my young son for when he is old enough to actually understand the rules. Neither me, nor anyone in my group is interested in this game. 

2018: While opinion of the game hasn't really changed, it is ALOT more fun to play with my son! He loves the monsters, the dice, the powers, everything! So im going to raise my rating from a 3 with adults only, to a 6 with kids!

RATING: 6
I really think my kids will enjoy this game but for me it's just ok because the best part of the game is underutilized. I'm talking about the cards. The game last long enough to maybe get 1 card on average which is a shame. I feel like the game would be better if at least you started with a card or maybe even if each monster had a special ability. Otherwise, the game is just ok if you want to chuck some dice.

RATING: 8.5
Loads of fun in a simple dice rolling game, the amount of strategy is definitely limited by the luck of the dice, but the power up cards available do provide a bit of opportunity to try and form a plan of attack (providing the dice are kind).  Very easy to learn/teach, and with the addition of the Power up expansion, this game has a lot of replay value to offer as well.

Update (6/26/17): I have 3 year old twin girls that always ask to "play" my games (which is usually just me opening the box so they can play with the game pieces).  Well, this game was easy enough to add "house rules" to make a playable version for my kids (we did not use the energy cards, so energy dice rolls were "try again"), and once we got going they loved it!  Definite bonus, and this will probably keep coming to the table due to that fact.

A fun game with a bit more going on than Yahtzee but really is Yahtzee at it's heart. It takes about 15 min/player in the game but can lead to a lot of downtime for the first player eliminated from play. I picked up a copy of King of New York thinking this style of game would be a good next step for my son in the next year or two and something we could play as a family.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

After initially preferring the extra strategy in King of New York, I've since come to appreciate the simplicity of King of Tokyo.  It's an easier game to explain to others, so it will hit the table more often the KoNY.

The game is really short and fun. Even if it is dice dependent it's not as frustrating as other games since you get re-rolls and can save your results.
The game can get quite exciting and everyone has a fun time, since the game is short if someone gets eliminated the downtime is not a lot.
It is a fast paced game and it exceeded my expectation.

I use it mostly as a filler game.

Fun, widely accessible game for pretty much all ages. Here, you take control of a big monster terrorizing the city of Tokyo, using energy to purchase upgrades & weapons to destroy the other monsters. In the end, there can be only one! Borrows the Yahtzee dice-rolling mechanic to attack the other monsters, heal your damage, use energy cubes, and gain victory points. First to 20 points OR last monster standing is the winner. Good times.

The gameplay is kind of light, and the monsters are identical except for the graphics. But it's a fun theme with great components. The way you get to customize your monster throughout the game by giving it new powers is a lot of fun. Although some of the powers synergize SO well that they break the game. And the game doesn't play very well with only 2 people, which is unfortunate because due to player-elimination, it's very likely to become a 2-player game at some point.

I love dice games but they have to present choices.  In KoT there is typically one obvious thing you need on a turn, either claws, or energy, or healing each with the same 1/6 chance.  You either roll them or you don't, that's it.  For me, too much luck and too few choices.  The other half of the die was some numbers that seemed like red herrings, too hard to get the combo and too pointless if you did.  I'd like to try again, but I suspect the only thing this game has going for it is the theme.  UPGRADE: with more players, rolling numbers seemed more relevant.  Maybe because each player was splashing a little damage on Tokyo rather than having to focus on it.  Monitor.

I strongly suspect I would enjoy this game more when my kids are older (oldest is 3).  Overall decent game, just other games we would enjoy more.

11/16/17 Update:  I've changed this game from a 6 to an 8.  As my kids have gotten older and able to process the game better, I've had more opportunities to play it with children.  I will say it's quite a hit.  I can see the value with it better than I did before.  I still don't like that it has a lot of downtime between turns as people roll dice, but there are other things much more enjoyable about it.

The more I play this game, the more I really enjoy it. It's a great game to teach a new group, then play a few consecutive games. Definitely best with at least 3 players, and preferably 4. Everyone is involved, even when it's not their turn, intensely watching the dice. The best mechanic is how the game rotates you against everyone else,  everyone and you versus another single player. It's leader-bashing, but throughout the game, everyone seems to find themselves in the lead.  Even the weak can be targeted though if you force them into Tokyo.

A fun and likeable filler - plays short so the luck aspect of dice is not really an issue and there are some tactical decisions to make. 

It's a little overproduced - the card wheels to record hit points and victory points are a bit unnecessary and actually don't work that well - VP and Health chips would have been better and cheaper. UPDATE: after additional plays I will go further, the card wheel scoring things are completely rubbish. They're easy to turn the wrong way when scoring, the wheels are loose enough that the score can change just by nudging the card, it's difficult to know other people's score and they undoubtedly added to the cost of the game. A separate score track (with plastic or wooden monster meeples) to keep the VP score and health point tokens to record your health, would have been much better.

A deck of cards, some cardboard chips, 7 dice and a largely cosmetic board should have come in under £20. Managed to get the base game and expansion for £30 so that was OK in the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.98
The theme of this game really fits into its game mechanics combining the luck of the dice and the deck of cards. The designer was perfect in every way to bring about the concept of dominating Tokyo by different monsters and the art used can appeal to a kids and adults as well. However, the Kaiju theme does not appeal to some people. If the people you're playing with is into this theme then the experience of playing King of Tokyo will be one that is unique, with excellent replay value that you would enjoy for a very long time.  However my experience playing this game with someone who is not into the Kaiju theme would stop even after just one round. So if you're really into Kaiju or Strange Monsters dominating Tokyo then you're in for a fantastic, out of this world ride playing the King of Tokyo.

The game relies heavily on luck and very little on strategy, which may not be for everyone.

The game mechanics allow for people being killed and eliminated early in the game, this might lead to some frustration. Suggested remedy: There is at least one card that allows to reenter the game; players may chose to treat this card as always active.

For some reason, this game is a lot of fun.  It's basically a big "king of the mountain" game.  But it has some cool things going for it.  First, it's not a pure "take that" game.  Who you attack is constrained by who if you are in Tokyo or not.  Second, you can take the target off you back whenever you want by leaving Tokyo.  Somehow, these simple implementations really work well.  Throw in some cards for theme and special abilities...and you have a fun dicefest that can be qualified as filler.  Will probably buy.

Players are monsters, fighting it out for victory points and damage in and around Tokyo.  Incredibly fun die roller where players take turns to roll 6 dice, and are granted two re-rolls before applying results.  Sets of 1, 2 or 3's will awards victory points, hearts heal your monster, while energy allows you to buy power cards.  The fun result is damage... if you are the King in Toyko, then you damage every other player, but if you are one of the other players you damage the King. Cute, fast and a lot of fun.

In some ways this game is like Roll Through the Ages, but more interactive.  Either way, it's a total blast to play.  The thematic special cards really create some fun and hilarious moments. The fact that it supports up to 6 people and is easy to learn is also a nice feature as that comes in handy in certain situations. The art and components are great as well. The only thing that would have made this game cooler is if the monsters each had 1 unique ability or trait.

This is quickly becoming my new go-to for introducting people to the hobby. The rules are very simple, it plays fast, there are several different tactics one can utilize to win, and luck can make anyone a winner.

If I had to find a fault for it, it would be that in a two player game, it is far too common to win by eliminating the other person and the game is short because of it.

Plain fun at the higher player counts, this has worked with everyone I've ever played it with. Preferable to king of New York. Gorgeous components and perhaps the best and most essential expansion (power up), which adds more depth - though this is not a deep game - with almost zero fiddle.

Dice-chucking, monster smashing fun. To be honest, it's basI call Yahtzee on steroids but it's tons of fun. Easy to teach, lots of replayability. The power up expansions (the one for KoT and KoNY) are a must.

Very easy to play and teach and satisfying to win. Dice-rolling element may turn some off but it's not "just Yahtzee" as some have claimed. There is player elimination but games are so quick you'll be back in before you know it. 

The first expansion (power up!) is recommended to add extra strategy. 

First played and received (as gift) in 2012.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.16
I don't think there really is anything other to say about this game, other than it takes the yahtzee mechanism and perfects it. A perfect blend of chaos, attacking, strategic moves and luck. This is the perfect game. Does it last? Yes! Will I play again? Always, this is a game I can bring anywhere, teach anyone and they always have fun.

RATING: 8
Great family and party game, even my 3-year-old nephew loves it, thanks to the unicorn character that was added as a bonus.
The only problem I got with it is connected with expansion "Power up". I got 2nd edition of the base game with 2 changed monsters comparing to the 1st edition, so either I use expansion from 2012 (which is kinda anti-climatic for my taste, especially as my favourite monster is Penguin) or i'll have to wait till Egmont, polish publisher, releases 2nd edition of expansion, which probably won't happen, as they don't even want to answer that concern.

RATING: 8
Quick and fun dice chucking party game. Revitalizes the Yahtzee mechanism and makes it not-solitaire. Varying upgrade cards keep it fresh and bring some variation. Plus, they are really thematic, nicely drawn and often quite funny. I love how you can look at your monster at the end of the game and laugh at your winged cthullu-esque Kraken monster with its giant brain and parasitic tentacles. A minor flaw is the possible player elimination, which can be mitigated when playing with the right (that means aggressive) group of people, because the games won't last that long.

Good fun - plays a little long with the 7 and 8 year olds, but we do enjoy it.  My kids love acquiring the cards.  We nearly had a victory point win condition during our last play.  I was in Tokyo with 16 VP, and had a card that doubled my victory points for controlling Tokyo.  When I told my kids that I would win unless they knocked me out before my next turn, the dice rolling became intense (
and awesome).  They didn't roll enough attack dice to beat me, but a card popped up with a -5 VP effect on all monsters.  I got KO'd shortly after.

Very enjoyable under the right circumstances. It's a fun theme that creates a great deal of lively (and usually friendly) competition. The one major downside is that if your character is killed early on, you are just stuck on the sidelines for the remainder of the game.

Before playing, I thought this would replace my desire to acquire [thing=17835][/thing].  After playing it twice, it has fallen off my wishlist.  Not that it's a bad game, it just needed some chrome!  The cardboard stand ups detract from what this game could have been.  Seriously needs some pimping.

On the plus side, our 5-player game was finished in under 30 minutes.  I certainly have some reservations about this title, but would play it again.

Really good light dice game which proves that Yahtzee variants can indeed be fun.   The game forces people into lopsided teams, and also forces people into Tokyo where they can't heal and hope they can hold out.   While the game is very simple, there are some thoughtful design elements included.  Really nice production with large dice, cool monster stand-ups, and tons of cards for a lot of variety.   Nicely done, Iello and Richard Garfield.

A maga nemében egy tökéletes kockás, parti játék. Hárman próbáltuk ki, de így is működött és hozta az egymást gyepálós "feeling"-et. Az egyetlen hibájának egyenlőre a nagydarab kockákat tartom. Néha kiejtettünk egyet-egyet a kezünkből, mert nem fért el benne rendesen az összes. Gyermekek még jobban megküzdhetnek ezzel, habár erről nincs tapasztalat. Egyszerű szabályok és játékmenet, kellően gyors, így ha valaki kiesik, nem kell sokat várnia, hogy újra játékba kerüljön. Kétféle módon lehet nyerni, vagy valaki elér 20 győzelmi pontot, vagy egyedül marad állva. Hát nálunk még senki nem ért el 20 győzelmi pontot :). Aki kedveli ezt a témát, óriás szörnyek püfölik egymást (csak jó lehet :)), annak egy kötelező darab. Persze a játék nem csak abból áll, hogy ki tud többet sebezni a másikon. Különböző kártyák segítségével különböző előnyökhöz lehet jutni, ezt kihasználva és ügyesen taktikázva könnyedén lehet nyerni. Nem szabad elfelejteni, hogy két energia kockáért el lehet dobatni a 3 felcsapott lapot... (Én még persze nem nyertem benne, de a feleségem kétszer is :), így ő nagyon kedveli ezt a játékot :)). Csak ajánlani tudom, örülök, hogy magyar nyelven is elérhető már. (2014.12.24.)
Azt nagyon szeretem ebben a játékban, hogy kevés, könnyen megjegyezhető szabályai vannak, így bármikor elővehető és 5 perc alatt kialakulhat egy jó kis ütésváltás :). (2016.12.25.)

Unfortunately, I can't play this game nearly as much as I'd like to. A few key members of my board game group are completely put off by the dice mechanics of King of Tokyo (and apparently Yahtzee,) after being beaten in the game a couple times.

I appreciate the light-hearted fun of King of Tokyo, as you stomp through the city, gain new powers and tear at one another. Power-up expansion was a godsend, giving a lot more flavor to the characters. I'd take this over King of New York any day - the game didn't need the extra level of complication.

This is just plain fun. Plays best at 5 and 6. I like the power up expansion but I just wish you evolved differently like rolling 4 energies or something. Everybody rolls for hearts and then it does start to bog the game down when monsters are evolving left and right. Cultist tiles are great.

This game received a lot of buzz upon released on BGG. I tried to steer away with the cult of new games and also I wasn't impressed with the artwork. Plus, I'm not fond of Asian themed games (although the theme in thin).

Knowing little to nothing about it, I gave it a try and it turned out to be a good game, but probably not so much to my liking. It's a simple game, fast even with 6 players, and quite a laugh we had. It's hilarious to see your opponent got kicked when he's menacing the city of Tokyo.

One small gripe, only after 2 plays, the dice arts/faces starting to chip off. The reprint which is planned to release sometime soon will contain engraved d

It's creatively designed but itself is not very creative.
When monsters are upgraded with super power cards, the fun multiplies.

I don't really like KOT as a 2 player game but with 3 or more players it is pretty fun.  I love the different paths to victory (most of the time our games ends with victory points). My only issue is I wish there were 30 victory points instead of 20.  Depending on how lucky you roll, you can win the game fairly quickly.  The last game I played I won the game by acquiring 7 victory points on my winning turn (rolling 4 3s and getting enough energy to buy 3VPs).  That's pretty lucky and kinda comes outa nowhere.

fun fact: this game was designed by Richard Garfield...creator of Magic the Gathering. 

This game is nothing like Magic the Gathering, but both games are epic in their own right. 

King of Tokyo is one of those games you can't believe is so much damn fun. It can be basic "HULK SMASH" or very cunning with a bit of strat. I would definitely put this game in the category "10 games every household should own"

I might actually rate this a 9 or 10 except I don't get to play it nearly as much as I'd like, so I'm hesitant to raise it up to those lofty heights.

The game is pure monster fighting fun.   You're smacking each other back and forth, in and out of Tokyo, knocking players out of the game, and the brilliant thing is it never feels personal.  There is a lot of enjoyment to be had in pushing your luck with the dice rolls, or seeing how long you can last in Tokyo.  If you make some foolhardy decision and get beaten out of the game, it's still fun to watch.

The theme and mechanics come together so well, even though on paper the combination of yahtzee and kaiju battles seems kind of odd.  King of Tokyo is a work of genius.  It's one of my favorites and I wish I could play it more.

This light weight push-your-luck game is full of Yahtzee style dice rolling fun!  Players roll 6 over-sized die with up to 2 re-rolls and use the faces of the dice to determine their actions.  The goal of the game is to be the first monster to score 20 points (either by occupying Tokyo or scoring points for die rolls) or be the last monster standing by destroying everyone else.  

There are tons of special power cards in the game that provide all sorts of benefits.  The cards are very thematic and include things such as extra head, poison spit, wings, fire breath, etc.

So far, everyone I've introduced this game to has enjoyed it immensely and have immediately requested another game.  The game does play 2 players but in my opinion you need at least 3, and the more the merrier!  

I originally brought this game as a filler game for my group, but we had so much fun we played it 4 times in a row!!!  This is a great family/light weight game simple enough for kids and fun for adults!  Also works well as a gateway game to introduce newcomers to the wonderful world of hobby gaming. Definitely recommended!

The production design kind of overwhelms the very simple gameplay. I like the asymmetrical roles players take on (being inside of Tokyo and fighting against everyone or being on the outside and trying to get in), but the scoring system needs more variety.

What a silly fun game! Easy to teach and provides some laughs. After playing with two, three, and six, it seems to scale really well. More people makes for more chaotic fun. And including Tokyo Bay does not detract from gameplay at all.

RATING: 8
A fun monster themed dice rolling game with great artwork. Player interaction is high and the deck of cards keeps things interesting. While players can be eliminated, the game plays quickly enough for this to not be an issue. Big dice, big monsters, big fun. I've settled on a houserule for the power cards as the game is simply more fun when players receive more of them. King of New York introduces extra monsters, but the gameplay slows down as the board events clutter such a streamlined game.

30-45m, best with 3-5 players. 15+ plays.

RATING: 7
A pretty fun dice game and one of the few "take that" games I don't mind because of the great theme. It's really fun to throw handfuls of those big, chunky dice and fight giant monsters in control of Tokyo. The power cards are really random and swingy but with a game that's relatively short it's not really that big a deal.

It's one of those games that is best played quickly though, so if your group is prone to AP or are very timid at games of a "take that" nature, I'd stay away. Good for thirty minutes, painful for an hour.

RATING: 5
King of Tokyo combines King of the Hill with Yahtzee.  Theme is giant monsters (like King Kong, Godzilla, etc.) attacking Tokyo.  On your turn you roll 6 dice and have 2 re-rolls.  The results are as follows: Attacking, Healing, Energy and VP (1, 2 or 3).  When attacking, you'll either attack the creature on Tokyo or if you're on Tokyo, all other monsters.  If attacked in Tokyo you can give Tokyo up and force the attacking player on.  This can be necessary as you can't heal on Tokyo.  Though, Tokyo provides VP when entering and when you can remain there until the beginning of your turn.  Healing is what it says.  VP requires a set of 3 of the same number to score that many VP.  Each extra result of that type will give a bonus VP.  Finally we have energy.  Energy is used to buy special ability cards which really changes the game.  I think it's the cards that really make this more interesting than other Yahtzee variants.  That and being able to kill the other players.  The winner is the last Monster standing or the first to 20 VP.  

I've recently had some games of this that have dragged and no longer like playing games with player elimination, so it's no longer a good fit for me.

Luke warm on this one. the packaging was too boxy for me, and for a quick smash em up game, it felt a tad boring waiting for the now all too common "Yahtzee wave of 3 dice roll mechanic" to come around the table. Also, waiting to buy cards felt too long and tiresome, having start powers would be a bit more exciting then finally getting one half way through the game to only use it for a few turns.

King of the Hill, err... I mean King of Tokyo is a fun game for a group of 4-6 players. Not much fun with only 2-3 players. We typically use house rules where everyone starts with a good amount of energy. That way,folks can buy cards earlier in the game. Way more fun that way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
King of Tokyo is a yahtzee-esq slugfest, reminicient of the classic Rampage arcade game. The king-of-the-hill attack mechanisms give the game a good feel, and the ability cards help solidify the clashing-monsters theme. The game overly encourages damage dealing, making the victory point condition mostly irrelevant which is a shame as in narrows the game to a singular strategy. But, considering its simplicity and accessible theme, it is one of the better kid-focused games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's been said the player elimination in this game is not problematic because it's so quick but the end game can drag making it a drag for those players knocked out early.  In addition, many of the cards (and there are many) have powers that just aren't that appealing for the cost.  Sometimes less is more.

Okay so this is a dice fest, but it is a fun dice festival with choices for healing, fame, energy, damage, cards, and...whether to be the King of Tokyo. The Evolution cards for the Power Up expansion help to make the different monsters in the basic set really different in more than just looks.  But it is a light and enjoyable game as is.

It's a press-your-luck dice game with some added strategic elements, but the theme makes it a lot of fun. It's a game that you can play with kids and honestly enjoy it, rather than feel like stabbing yourself repeatedly in the eye. It's quick, silly fun that's easy to grasp. I would not hesitate to bring this game out for almost any situation or group of people of at least 3 players. Purchased from FLGS.

Oddly enough, falls flat nearly everytime. This is mostly due to the presence of "non-cult nerds" at game sessions, who have no interest in Godzilla or King Kong. If you have that kind of group, this game is an easy sell. Just get it and have a great time. If your group isn't "core scifi" then go watch the movies with them first. Call it a night of research.

3/23/15: Played again with a different group. Maybe it's just my core group doesn't like it much? Was a hit with the new group, a more family style group with several younger kids.

This game is a great dice game that is probably meant to be more of a filler type game but often ends up being a "main" game for the night.

Really though, who doesn't want to play a game where they are big monsters fighting over Tokyo!?

One of the games that always end up with "just one more round!". I have converted many non-gamers to the hobby through this game, and expect to continue doing so for many years to come.

Even among experienced gamers, very rarely have I seen people turn down a request to play King of Tokyo. Always a good time.

My only thing complain is that the "exit Tokyo without taking damages" card is very over-powered in a 2 player game, so we usually take it out.

[2 plays] This seemed like an OK game at first, but it also seemed like a short, snappy game. Now I think it's just longer than the degree of my interest in it.  I also thought at first it would be a game where player elimination wouldn't be a big deal because the game was so short, but it's really not.  In a con setting or something where you can be eliminated, wander off, and find something else to do, it's OK, but if what you're going to do when eliminated is wait for these people to finish the game so you can do something else with them, it can really drag. This might be better with fewer players for these reasons, and because you have a bit more control over your fate; with lots of players, if you go around the table and everyone bashes you, it's easy not to survive till your next turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Exciting, fast, fun, and quite simple.  The most fun I've had playing a board game since I was a kid.

That lasted about 8 plays.  I'd rather not play it anymore.

Even though KoT only rates a 6, it's still a great gateway game, maybe the best, so it's a shiny, gold 6.

9 out of 10 for kids. Very accessible and fun, but limited strategy and too random despite the push your luck mechanics.  The game is over before you can save for most of the cards, so they are mostly useless.  Great to play with kids because of the fast play and dice rolling, also monsters!

An excellent dice game with a fun theme and great artwork. There's always something good you can do on each turn. The variety of special ability cards keep replay ability high. This game does not work with only 2 players! Generally I do not like games with player elimination but this one is short and the mechanic matches the theme.

I'm usually wary of any game with a heavy amount of dice rolling but this game was a nice change.  Has several unique elements and ways to win.  Theres actually a lot less luck to this than you would think too.  its more about changing your strategy based on what you roll and what others do.  The interaction level is solid, its a good party game with a small learning curve.  works really well with any number of players.  the quality of the game and the art is good too. Only issue is eliminated players are completely eliminated and have to wait around for the game to finish.  Overall I recommend.

Great play for a family game. The Yahtzee feel is mitigated by the ability to reroll and have cards that can directly impact die rolls preventing frustration in the young ones.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) Another next-generation Yahtzee spin-off like [GAMEID=37380], but instead of building up a civilization, you're using the dice to smack around other horrific monsters.

King of Tokyo is easy to grasp and fun to play, You can formulate a strategy around the updgrade cards, but mostly you just roll with it.

First play at a convention several years ago, game had just come out and this game didn't really grab my interest.  Ho hum play, but could be more due to playing with a full table of strangers than anything to do with the actual gameplay.  Upon second play much more recently with my wife and friend, I had a much better experience - game lived up to the hype.  It's a good variant on the yahtzee mechanism.  Only minor nit picky item on components is that I with the health and points dials had bigger numbers and bigger cutouts.  Otherwise the components were great.

Yahtzee of the new generation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yahtzee a little bit beefed up with monsters puts this game pretty solidly at filler level.  I enjoy the references to monster movie tropes on the cards and like playing.  Not sure how I feel about the moving into Tokyo mechanism as our games often devolve into people being forced into Tokyo, not willingly going.  Definitely need to pick up the expansion, though.  Worth mentioning that this game is SUPER accessible, even for people that might think that they dislike board games other than the "classics."  Pretty much everybody can get behind 'Yahtzee with monsters.'  While the expansions can add some extra length to the game not as readily present in just base, I really enjoy that they provide more options for rolls.  Rating is 1 number lower without expansions.

Rating applies to KoT with Power UP expansion. I don't usually play without, most people I know don't. Without evolutions, I'd take a pass. With them, I'd never turn it down. I have read many glowing reviews of expansions in the past only to find they weren't that vital. Get Power up.

This game is not very deep and only has a minimal amount of strategy, but it sure is a lot of fun. Fast, simple, and just a little bit goofy; it's a great filler game and fills that "action movie" niche for when you are not in the mood for the highbrow drama of a Eurogame.

Great example of a quick, fun game that's easy to teach, but has enough depth of strategy to make it interesting to play, again and again.

I enjoy this game, just the right amount of random, just the right amount of choice. The dice rolls make you choose your strategy carefully - building power to get abilities, taking the city and holding it by force, or pressing your luck to farm VP from dice alone. The heal mechanic feels good as well. My one complaint is the "when you die, you're out" issue - it alienates players who die because they are no longer participating and invested in the game.

I need to concoct the ideal two-player variant for this, because it usually gets to the table with my eldest only.
I've had surprisingly little success with this when other kids were around. The cards can confuse non-gamers, and they either ignore them or get bogged down in them. In my own experience, younger children just can't manage to keep things moving along and light-hearted. I've never played with the expansions, but if they start you out with different abilities, that might go a long way to solving some of those issues.
Update: I do have to say, though, that its simplicity and thematic fun just carry it through. It doesn't come out super-often, but it's an evergreen.

I have two games that I will promptly take from the shelf if non-gamer friends visiting me discover my collection and ask to play something. If it is more than a single friend, the game is King of Tokyo. I have presented it to more than a dozen people and it is infallible fun. A genius design (Garfield, what can I say?) which explores the repressed and universal human drive to gang against an individual, specially if it is a leader.

RATING: 6.5
This is a good little game despite the fact this is a dice game involving a lot of luck.  It is short, light, and simple.  It is a "King of the Mountain" type game and when played with the right crowd can generate a lot of surprises and laughs. 

The cards are well done. I often object to this type of card play when added to a game--but I enjoyed these cards. They are different and refreshing. 

The characters are large & sturdy cardboard in broad-based holders. The rest of the components are nice, but few and simple and therefore I have a lot of trouble seeing $44 worth of value.  Seems a little over priced for what it is.  The game sells out quickly so that obviously doesn't deter many.  

I shock myself by thinking I might get this game when it becomes available again.

A gateway, family themed game. Simple and fun with Yahtzee-style dice rolling mechanics. Card powers add a layer of depth. However, the fact that it is often possible, with a bit of luck ofcourse, to win by just scoring points through dice rolls dampens the more enjoyable aspects of fighting for the control of Tokyo.

Pros
-Quick and easy Yahtzee style game (only one type)

-Can play as giant monsters

-Every monster is exactly the same (no special powers - but this is changed in the expansion)
-Thunderbolts and buying power cards seemed weak in my play through

Humorous dice game, not to be taken too seriously, just silly fun. Every game is also pretty different, given the cards that come into play, the rolls and the situations of your opponents. But always the same kind of fun. Perhaps the characters could have a different skill, but you could also just attach a starting card to each of them. If more cards and characters are to come, I'll surely buy them.

The more (players) the merrier.

My Halloween variant: after choosing monsters, each player draws 2 costume cards, selects 1, and gains 5-X energy, where X= the cost of the costume.

This allows you to actually use the expansion's content and gives you a bit of choice for something you choose (a costume) as opposed to something you don't choose (who you are).

This game has to make my list of top 5 good game purchases ever - I bought it as a Christmas gift (among other things) for my 12-year-old son who doesn't usually enjoy most of the games I play with my other older children.  This one was an immediate hit - the perfect blend of exciting art, quick gameplay, the right dose of luck with all the fun of dice-rolling, player interaction and confrontation, and interesting decisions to be made.  He has thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the rest of our children, and it makes a great filler with adults as well.  The card deck allows for each game to play out differently.  This would be my top recommendation for a great family game right now.

RATING: 4
Really wanted to like this game - it's a fan favorite, beautiful production value and colors, the game is easy to teach and light for beginners.  

Gave it a couple chances, but it was just not a good game in my opinion.  Way too easy to die.  The only strategy for each player was to roll for hearts/hits, which made it difficult to roll victory points, and also made it hard to gain and save up energy (lighting bolts). When you finally did have enough energy, the upgrade cards were inconsistently priced - some are cheap and very powerful and change the course of the game, and others are really expensive and do not help much. Most are just pointless and seem to be added as a meek effort for variety.  There was also a lot of downtime for somebody if they got knocked out early.  

We even played with variants (double energy per lightning bolt, two piles for 'keep' and 'discard' cards, two card draft at the beginning of the game, etc.) and the game was still not fun for me or the group. 

Fortunately, was able to return to Amazon for a full refund (thank you Amazon!).  Maybe I will give King of New York a try to compare the differences

Yahtzee style dice rolling. It's fun and accessible. I've played it with gamers and kids alike, because lets face it, everyone likes large monsters beating each other up.

Player elimination and lots of luck, but still the most consistently enjoyable light game. Everyone likes it. And it's always exciting. I rarely bother with the Power Up expansion, simply because there's almost always a newbie at the table. Either way, it plays great. If I'm with hardcore gamers, this sort of game isn't my first choice (which explains why my rating doesn't seem to match the praise I'm giving the game now), but if I'm not in the right crowd for breaking out Great Western Trail or whatever, this is perfect.

Combine Yahtzee-style dice rolling with Japanese B-movies of dubious entertainment value, and the result might look somewhat like King of Tokyo.

I suppose it does what it set out to do: provide some mindless fun and offer lots of opportunity to lunge out and bash everyone else. Heightened emotional reactions through monster embodiment. Or something.

All of that lasts about as long as you need to realise that the influence any single player has on the mayhem going on in Tokyo is practically zero. The dice actions are most uninteresting and you have to look for decision points with a magnifying lense. Even so, it does have a certain entertainment value.

Drôle de parcours face à cet objet ludique. Avec un camarade joueur, on en lisait et on en entendait beaucoup de bien. Mais voilà, le graphisme de la boîte, avec les petites figurines cartonnées et son look aguicheur pour ne pas dire putassier nous laissait de marbre et nous rebutait. Et pourtant, nous étions tous les deux passés pas la case "Magic". Mais on se doutait bien que, malgré un auteur commun, les deux choses n'avaient pas grand chose en commun. Si, le succès.

Mais voilà, un jour de janvier 2013, on se rend pour la première fois à une soirée jeux organisée dans un bar par la boutique au meeple orange qui fait la fierté de notre ville (avec le jeu créé par Stefan Feld). Mais on arrive en retard, du coup toutes les tables sont prises, on boit un coup, je renverse un Irish Coffee sur mon ami, et finalement on apprend que des tables se libèrent dans la salle du bas. On avait le choix entre "Takenoko", que l'ami en question possède déjà et... "King of Tokyo". Du coup, on se dit que c'est l'occasion de l'essayer et on s'assoit à trois autour de cette table.

Un animateur vient rapidement nous expliquer les règles (merci à lui, très dynamique et qui communique sa bonne humeur), simplissimes. On fait une partie, on trouve le tout très fun, on enchaîne sur une deuxième, qu'on apprécie aussi beaucoup. Depuis, on ne l'a pas acheté mais on a eu l'occasion d'en refaire quelques parties et de faire découvrir le jeu à d'autres camarades ludiques, qui eux aussi ont accroché rapidement.

Car ce jeu est ce qui se fait de mieux dans sa catégorie. On s'y amuse, on met des baffes, on se charrie, on pousse des cris un peu étranges, on rigole, on crie après un mauvais jet de dés, on voit des retournements de situation... le tout en trente minutes maximum, dans une très bonne ambiance et avec des mécanismes très bien huilés.

Tout n'est certes pas parfait et le graphisme qui me rebutait au début demeure, mais il colle bien au thème finalement. Le truc, c'est qu'on voit vite arriver les limites de ce genre de jeu, qui est très fun à sortir de temps en temps et assez addictif, mais dont on n'enchaîne pas trente parties non plus. On s'amuse énormément aux premières, un peu moins aux suivantes. Le mécanisme de stop ou encore est tout simple mais demeure efficace et permet d'élaborer différentes "stratégies", même si le résultat de celles-ci reposent beaucoup sur celui des dés qui peuvent la ruiner. Mais au fond, dans un jeu de ce format, ce n'est pas si grave, et l'élimination progressive des joueurs n'intervient pas dès le début de la partie. De plus, comme la partie est courte, ils ne sont pas éliminés trop longtemps.

Différencier les espaces et les coups portés par la présence ou non sur Tokyo est également très astucieux et permet un minimum de gestion de sa partie. Ajoutez à cela le mécanisme de collecte d'énergie pour prendre des cartes qui changent un peu la donne sans trop déséquilibrer le jeu (enfin, ça dépend, mais sur plusieurs parties, ça se lisse) et la capacité d'enquiquiner les adversaires en les défaussant toutes ajoute encore une petite subtilité à un jeu qui ne l'est pas vraiment.

En bref, et malgré un parti pris graphique qui ne me conquiert pas totalement (mais qui, encore une fois, colle assez au thème) et quelques limites (rien de vraiment novateur, un nombre de joueurs qui est là plus pour attirer l'acheteur car à deux c'est nettement moins intéressant et à six c'est un peu trop le bordel) , je suis très satisfait d'avoir découvert ce jeu qui, je pense, devrait un jour ou l'autre rejoindre ma ludothèque. Car malgré toutes les faiblesses qu'on peut lui trouver, on s'amuse en général beaucoup en y jouant, et c'est peut-être le principal.

Yahtzee-ish game that's not nearly as good as Roll Through the Ages.  Odd "king of the mountain" game where one key to winning is to spend the first half of the game NOT being king of the mountain.  Thematic disconnect there - where theme is the main thing going for the game.

It is exactly what you expect it to be. A relatively simple push your luck, screw your opponents game with a Yahtzee based dice mechanic. The art is gorgeous, and even though the theme is not super relevant to the mechanics, the amount of care they put putting the theme over it shows and makes it cool. 

Also, there is a lot of really interesting decisions to be made through out the game, even though it plays with the speed of a filler.

King of Tokyo has a very cool theme and I love doing monster voices when I play. The gameplay is simple but fun and if it worked as a filler i'd rate it very highly. The problem is that it can last 45 min to an hour and I just want more meat on my one hour games.

Played 4 times in a row the first time we tried it. That's the only time I ever remember doing that with a game. Simply a blast to play. Takes a simple dice rolling mechanic and adds in a ton of variety with cards to beef up your monsster or mess with the other monsters.

Would rate even higher, but this game is very dependent on the group. When I get the guys together, it's stunning.  Pure joy.  But during my normal mixed group, it's just a dice game.  Crazy how that works.

A good longish filler or lite evening game. Simple nice bits, good theme, simple mechanic, randomish tactical game. Does have player elimination, but short enough to make it not a problem but rather a payout to play better next time - solid 7 game. (June 2013).

I like the fact that this game is fun, easy to teach, great for family and fast to play. The components are colourful and the dice feel great in your hand. I enjoy any kind of push-your-luck based game and I think this game masters it. It has multiple levels of depth, whether you invest in cards or not, which makes it great for both adults looking for a bit more strategy and replayability and kids who have fun rolling the dice and hitting the other monsters.
I don't like the player elimination side - but it is not a showstopper because games are quite short anyway.
I am not a fan of the triple 1, 2 or 3 to give you victory points as it gives an alternative to getting to move in Tokyo, which is not thematic and not as fun. Also, being in Tokyo does not reward much (2 points a full turn) for the risk you are taking, which leads many players just hoping not to get invited to move in Tokyo - which once again is not thematic.
Finally, the set of actions and decisions is quite limited which somewhat hinders replayability for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game by any stretch, but highly luck-based due to the nature of the dice. The push-your-luck aspect combined with hit points and damage tends to make me want to play safe rather than push things too far, but that doesn't make the game any less enjoyable, rather makes me feel like I'm not playing the game as optimally as I could. Good game to play with my kids, as it plays fast and it's easy for me to throw and let them win.

Not horrible, but really nothing extraordinary either.  I don't mind playing a game or two once in a while with my daughter, but when playing larger games I can't shake the feeling that the game is missing-lacking something.  It seems like it wants to be more than a random dice battler, which it isn't.  I expected much more from the cards, and was somewhat let down by my expectations there.  The game can be decent quick fun, however. 

NOTE: Components are also cheap, in the first edition.  I had to request replacement character sheets, standies, and dice.  There was already damage before the box was even opened.  This seems to be a common complaint.  If you have kids, these things will NOT hold up.  If you travel with the games, be sure to use plastic baggies or something to help protect the cards (sleeved won't fit in the insert without cutting the insert or removing it altogether).  Every time I've traveled with this game, cards have been set loose through the box and damaged.  They have to be rubber-banded or paper band at the least.  I ditched the crap insert and put everything into ziplock baggies.

I like dice, but only to a limit.  This is about as random a game as I'll enjoy, but enjoy it I did.  Sure, a purely pasted-on theme, but highly enjoyable and moves quickly.  We played two games with 5 players, and I can see that this needs at least 4 to play well.  I wish the cards played a more prominent role.  Swings in points happen almost too quickly, but I guess that's what happens when you play a random dice game!

Great fun! My kids probably enjoy this game the most because of its accessibility and characters. It's a bit too random for me, though. The Yahtzee-like elements don't create too much room for strategy, which makes the game lean a lot more on chance. Still, it's a great little game that can be quickly taught and understand by anyone.

This is a good family game, can be played pretty quickly, and works for the 6 year old and 9 year old while not boring the adults.  We've only just begun to get underway with this one, but it's promising.

Edit: After a few more plays, I have reduced my score by 2 points to a 5. This is a really boring game with no real decisions.  Cute components and a fun theme, yes. But boring play and player elimination, no.   It may be a short fun filler game, but with all the other options out there, am I really going to pull this one out?

This basically takes a similar gameplay element from Martian Dice/Zombie Dice/Yahtzee and adds a few more thematic elements. (Power cards, energy cubes to buy cards, and a risk-reward situation when it comes to jumping to the Tokyo spot.)

this is a fun party/family game, essentially a yahtzee variant with a monster theme, but a lot more fun than that sounds. We all had a good time, and we played with 5 heavy duty gamers.

RATING: 8
One of the best games to play with younger players and still feel competitive as an adult.  It's all about the luck of the dice, and it's surprising how quickly young players develop a strategy for gameplay.  The power up cards make each game a little different so after countless plays it's still yet to get stale.  This one's probably been played more than any other game in the house.

The expansions, so far, haven't really been fully utilized.  It's nice to have more characters to play but, overall, the expansions are not all that necessary.

Great game! I love the art and the quality of the board/pieces. I have two complaints though: First, it's listed as a 2-6 player game, but I'd say a minimum of 3 is required or else it's no fun. Second, I'd like to have more ways of earning energy to spend on the cards. The card effects are hilarious and are my favorite part of the game - so getting to use them more would be awesome. I believe there's an expansion out, and I plan on getting it soon.

For a game that is nothing more than a dice-fest at its heart, it's actually not bad.  It does everything right that a dice-fest game should do right.  It's short, and you can re-roll the dice similar to Yahtzee.

In a nutshell, this game is like Yahtzee only with theme, and cards, and energy cubes, and monsters, and a Tokyo board.

King of Tokyo is a lightweight game that is really fun for my lucky husband (who just loves dice, and whom dice love in return) and has enough strategy to hold my attention. While this game might be a lot better with more players, it is fine for two. The rules were fairly easy for us to grasp after a single read-through. The components are nicely designed and produced, but the dice symbols are not etched into the faces in the version I have. They are already showing some wear after only one game. Edit: I purchased replacement dice with etched faces. Problem fixed.

RATING: 4
My son wanted this because of the art, and the Kaiju theme.

I found this to be less than 'OK.'
Again, yet another game that I just don't get the hype around. It's really bland and boring, and the only thing cool or fun about it was the art. The standees and board seem pointless, but not quite as pointless as all the cards. I'm not sure there's a real game here - it looks like a box full of bling and very little substance, and when you play it, you realize that it is.

This is OK for kids and barely passable at that. Everything about it just felt to me to be lacking.

My kids found it weird you do nothing with the standees, which look really cool, and give the game a really cool theme and feel....but then they don't really have anything to do with the actual game.

This is an over-produced dice filler that should cost less than half of what it does.

It's really weird too, because I love dice-chuckers. But this one was just plain bad, and boring.

Some further comments since the kids wanted to try it out again:

What's the point of the cards? - while they add some interesting and unique stuff to the game, I never found the need to waste dice saving up energy to buy abilities when it's much more prudent to kick the stuffing out of your opponents.

It's over too fast to even get into the depth of what the cards are supposed to provide. And 20 VP to win? It would take forever, and not in a single game we've played has anyone gone above 10 VP before everyone else is killed.

So much of this game seems really pointless. Outside of the dice and life/points counter, everything else feels tacked on and superfluous.

Also, player elimination has to be THE WORST rule to incorporate into a family game - yeah.....it's real fun for one kid to get knocked out first, and sit there and watch the rest of the game unfold. They usually just go and play on their own or watch TV. 

So, as far as bringing the family together over a game? This is one stinking pile of crap.

As you can probably tell, I hate this piece of shit and have zero desire to play this ever again.

BUT! My kid loves this damn thing to death. So, I`m forced to play, just so I can get him into other stuff as his tastes mature. And let me say there needs to be more Kaiju themed games.

Very easy and simple to learn, fast to play and everyone loves! Dice intensive, but leaves you with the ability to choose your dice. Recommend for all! Though I heard its even better with the expansion. (it is! Power up!)

It's been downgraded on my list because it's replay ability is dieing out for me. Just not enough to this game and not short enough to be a filler
 
My replayability has risen back up for this game! Its hard not to come back to it eventually. Just do not play with the shrink ray card, needlessly draws it out. 

Back up to ten! Such an easy game to bring out to people knew to the gaming world

RATING: N/A
This is a fun game which often frustrates me. Ultimately, a lot of it comes down to luck. I find it plays totally differently 2-player compared to more players. Much quicker and more brutal with 2 players. With 4 or more people, I find you have more freedom to embrace different styles of play (some people might build cards, some may aim to deal more damage) and players may have different agendas depending on which cards they hold. 

I have played the Power Up! expansion with the lunchtime game group and think it really adds to the game. I would purchase it if I played KoT more outside of work.

Light dice game. No strategy, just yatzee-style dice rolling and card buying (based on random dice rolling based income).

Excellent game, Richard Garfield's best since the days of Magic, RoboRally, and Netrunner. There is real beauty in the way that the simple rules allow multiple approaches and generate interesting patterns of play. Players can win either by earning 20,000 Twitter followers, or by knocking out all of the other monsters. The balance between these goals is perfect. King of Tokyo almost always ends in a photo finish. Upon seeing the mathematical elegance of this game, it is rumored that Reiner Knizia has abandoned his similar prototype about ancient Mesopotamian flower gardens.

If you're going for the win via Twitter followers, it is highly recommended that you announce your Tweets and/or Facebook updates. Also, when choosing monsters you will definitely want to get your hands on "The King," since he has already named himself King of Tokyo and your victory is assured. The only other viable possibility is to make a Chuck Norris standup, and smuggle him into game night.

I plan to make cutouts of my nephews to use as additional rampagers.

The game is just a lot of fun and it's great because it can easily be introduced to novices in about 5 minutes. The dice rolling is very random and I wish there was more strategy to the game, but in one roll while I was in Tokyo, I was able to eliminate all three members of my family who all had 5 or more health when they never thought they were in jeopardy. That was a super fun moment. The theme is great for kids and adults alike and the short time frame makes for a perfect option when time is limited.

Disposable fun. Was a bit more mechanical in play than I anticipated. The key decision seems to be knowing when to cut and run, which fights the theme of being a giant monster. Would make for a fine drinking game if you took a shot whenever you became the King of Tokyo. I'd play again. Handsome production values.

RATING: 6.5
Good monster fighting game.  The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 20 victory point or to be the only one alive.

On your turn, you have to roll the 6 dice up to 3 times (you can keep dice between roll).  The dice have the following faces :
1 : gives you 1 victory point if you have 3 (+1 VP for each other 1).
2 : gives you 2 VP if you have 3 (+1 VP for each other 2).
3 : gives you 3 VP if you have 3 (+1 VP for each other 3).
Energy : each of those gives you 1 energy cube (can be use to purchase card that gives you special power).
Heart symbol : each of those gives you 1 health point back.
Monster hand : each of those cause 1 point of damage to the monster(s) you're attacking.

Your monster can be in Tokyo or outside Tokyo.  When in Tokyo, the monster can't use heart symbol to heal.  There's only place for one monster in Tokyo (except for 5-6 player game).  Attack are made to the monster(s) that are not at the same place as you are (if you're in Tokyo, you attack all the monster that aren't in Tokyo and vice versa).
Each time the monster in Tokyo is attacked, he chooses to stay or leave.  If he leaves, the monster that attack him goes in Tokyo.
Each time a monster enters Tokyo he gain 1 VP.
Each time a monster is in Tokyo when his turn begin, he gain 2 VP.

The game end when a player reach 20 VP or when there's only one monster alive.

Even for a (mostly) eurogamer this game is fun. Yes, most dice driven fight games are unsatisfying but this one is really ok as you try to balance out attacks and getting back health points. Works with several amount of players. I consider it as a quick  filler. Don't expect control, what you get is hilarious fun where you can turn off your brain while having beer & pretzels. Still the best dice roller filler until now.

Somehow, this game found itself heavily recommended in the Board Games Google+ community. I was happy to eventually come across an opportunity to play the game at open gaming one night. I get what people see in the game. Brightly colored components, large dice and simple gameplay. I normally don't care too much for dice rolling mechanics because I feel like choices are being taken away from me, but in this game the decisions are based around your keeping or re-rolling dice. The tension in the game is somewhat based around your choices to NOT keep what might be good for you.

At the same time, though, sometimes it just comes down to the dice being stupid and ruining your game. Either way it makes for a fun, light game.

My biggest gripe with King of Tokyo was that it didn't feel very rewarding standing in Tokyo and that the balance of certain Energy cards was all over the place.

On the plus side it was short, easy to learn and we had fun. But my friend has since sold the game and I don't feel like we're missing out.

A great little push-your-luck game; lightweight, but with a fair bit of strategy (you choose whether to go for aggressive, defensive, points-seeking, or upgrade paths, and how much you mix these approaches). The upgrades allow quite a bit of variety, and mean games turn out very different from each other.

Love this quick dice throwing game which is appropriate for all ages.  Has a great king-of-the-hill mechanic which forces players to be timely on wanting to score points or bash their opponents.

It's shallow and luck-based - and yet so fun.  It's fast and dynamic and our group is almost always up for a quick game before getting down to something serious.  It's a roll/keep dice mechanic where you're trying to balance competing priorities of survival, earning points, and upgrading abilities.

Very fun little dice game filler.  Especially if you are a monster movie fan.  Random and light.  I can see this working well with kids.  The game is usually over quick enough before you get frustrated for not rolling what you want on the dice.  Scratches the same itch as Quarriors for me and is more fun.  Highly recommend for fans of monster movies.  Recommend for light game fans and those with boy children.  Don't recommend for grognards and people who hate random games that can sometimes feel like they are playing themselves.

First few times I played this I did not care for it (neither did my core game group). However, it has hit the table a few times as a filler and it has really grown on me.  Great game for new and existing gamers, it's dice rolling mechanic is fun, simple, and still offers strategy. My only complaint is that sometimes the cards flipped up aren't really worth it and can really take the "energy strategy" a real dud. We have started removing certain cards from the deck to offer a higher reward for focusing on "bolts".

Read many reviews about this game especially from the Dice Tower and Geek and Sundry with Will Wheaton before purchasing.  It is exactly how the Dice Tower describes.  Fast moving, lots of action and lots of laughter.  The volume level at the table increases every time we play!  The power-up cards really intensifies the play.  I noticed that each of us stopped focusing on victory points and just went straight to the 'attacks' to knock opponents out of the game.  Fun, fun, fun.

Garfield is a legend, and there is a good reason for this.
Tokyo is clearly one of the most popular games out there, acessible and fun for the whole family. It may not hold more experienced gamers for long, as is too much like Yahtzee, but it is good enough.
Sometimes can overstay it welcome a little and has a problem of player elimination, but it is a good game to introduce people to the hobby. Probably best at 4-5.

simple rules, brilliant art work, and a Cyberbunny! Good filler/starter game for the evening, short game play time,small learning curve, and a good laugh.

It falls short in that the monsters have no unique abilities, and there is very little game strategy.

I know I'm not in its target audience, but I don't understand why this game is so popular. Maybe it's a combination of fanboyism for the designer, the kaiju theme and mob mentality.

Rolling dice tends to be at least a bit fun in other games, but here it is completely unexciting. In your turn, you just roll the dice three times, keeping whichever dice you want between rolls. Oh!, you may also spend energy to buy special cards that range from useless to ridiculously powerful. To add insult to injury, this boring luck fest also includes player elimination.

It may be fine to play once in a blue moon as a group activity, but it is barely a game. I concede that at least it is relatively harmless and not annoying like "Sentinels of the Multiverse" - just to mention another absurdly overrated piece of trash that I've played recently.

I'm not sure I see the hype.  This is a decent game, but really it's just Yahtzee on steroids.  Pros are that it plays quickly and the cards can add a little variety (but not much).  Nice if you just feel like mindlessly rolling dice for a break between longer games.

A favorite here at home. Everyone loves the theme and art. The gameplay is light but fun. Dice rolling, card abilities. A great Gateway games. i've converted some friends to boardgaming with this game alone. Keep coming back in the rotation on a regular basis. highly recommanded.

Interesting dice roller...I'm pretty sure I missed a play in my stats as I remember playing this on two different occassions, once with the expansion. Not sure I love it, but is a decent filler or wind down game.

RATING: 9
Fun little game. The art is fantastic, the board is minuscule and most of the components look delicious. A great game to get people who don't play boardgames to stop calling you weird for collecting piles of cardboard (of course, it works best whith people willing to go "RROOOOOOAAARRRR" when they take Tokyo). However, it is just a game about rolling dice and hoping for the best, so you can only find so much fun there.
It's actually perfect for what it is... King of Tokyo has a place in my collection for a while.
EDIT: Can't give this any less than a 9. I've just played it so much

Very clever game. What I like the most is how simple yet balanced strategy versus luck this game is. Clearly there are some mechanics borrowed from Yatzy or something similar and in my opinion that was genius. The ability to stay in the city or out of it and try to balance the benefits of it through out the game makes it very interesting. Oh, and also, pretending you are GOJIRAAAA. That is awesome.

This is a pretty fun light game with a little bit of strategy, not a whole lot, but some.  The game goes fast which is nice, but I do not care for having multiple routes to victory.  I understand why there are two, but winning by points seems like the game was a waste and always leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

As you go up in players up to 4, it makes it easier to win by points, since the guys in the middle rarely make it around a whole turn to attack out, which I don't like.  The rest is fun though and fairly fast.

RATING: 7.5
This game is simple, quick and pretty fun.  I play with kids, and I imagine that if you play with a lively group of adults it could be over-the-top fun.  As it is, we're enjoying it more and more as we get more familiar with the different power-up cards and the best way to exploit them.  It's also very nice to look at in a playful way.  One knock against it is that all the monsters are the same -- it seems like the monsters could have balanced, special powers that make choosing your avatar more meaningful than just prefering the look of your cardboard counter.  But as it is, the game mechanic is still unique and a lot of fun and involves some risk management and meaningful decision making, and KOT is one of those games where you really never know who is going to win or be eliminated until it actually happens.  You can have a guy about to win on VP get suddenly eliminated from the game by a hot attack role from an opponent.  That always keeps a game interesting to the end.  I don't like games (Monopoly, Conquest of Nerath, etc) where you can get into a hole and know you are never climbing out, but you have to keep slogging on waiting to lose.  One drawback, however, is that a player (or more) can get eliminated early and have nothing to do while the game goes on.

Also, setup is very fast and the games are short, and it's important to have a few games like that in the house for the days when you don't have hours to spend.

Counter-productive. Encourages turtling and laborious building up. Aggressive players seem to die early. More points are gained by rolling 1s, 2s and 3s than by actually battling for Tokyo. Also there are too many spoiler powers that allow people to take cards off others, make others lose points and block damage. These slow the game down when it should really be fast and furious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
King of Tokyo is a Yahtzee-style dice game that is very simple to teach to new players within the span of a few minutes. It's great as both a short filler and a gateway boardgame for new players.

The artwork is imaginative and playful. Moreover, the gameplay mechanics are immediately intuitive and seem to lend to the monster theme of the game. While not the most strategic game, I enjoy it for what it is: an immersive and light game.

Yahtzhee variant with great theme and nice bits.  I didn't feel like I was really making very many choices, but for a filler dice chucker take that sort of game its a lot of fun.  There are other games out there with better strategy in the same time frame.  The big choice is when to go to Tokyo and when to leave Tokyo.  

Best thing about the game is I think it is simple enough to play with family members or non-gamers.

King of Tokyo is a light, beer-and-pretzels style game with a quick playing time and a healthy dose of luck. It also scales wonderfully from 2-6 players, though I think it's just plain more fun with more monsters - ah, I mean, players.

The premise of the game is basically the same as [thing=17835][/thing]. That is to say, it's not JUST Godzilla or King Kong, it's ALL THE MONSTERS and they are going to kill each other, not just the planet. The cardboard stand-ups of the monsters are high-quality and have great cartoony illustrations. It has a bunch of custom dice and some special power cards which are really what make the game shine.

Just as in Yahtzee or [thing=37380]Roll Through the Ages[/thing], you take a fistful of dice and get three rolls, keeping whatever you want from the previous roll and re-rolling the rest. The goal is to either kill all the other monsters or get 20 points. The dice have various combinations that get you points, healing, attacks on other monsters or energy. Energy is the currency of the game and is used to buy special cards.

As you would expect from Richard Garfield, these cards all break the game in various ways, changing the rules just for your monster so he has a leg up on the other critters. There are tons of these cards; it will probably take 4-5 games (depending on the number of players) to see them all, even if you set aside the ones you already used. 

If I had to describe this game in one word it would be "addicting". I can't think of another game that creates more of a feeling of "just one more game" than this one.

We love playing King of Tokyo with our son (8 years old as of this review).  The game plays quickly and is simple to understand.

The game can swing a bit based on dice roles (for example; my son's first game he rolled 3+ 3s every turn and won outright with little challenge).

There are a lot of great special power cards, but without some house rules to get players more energy early the cards don't come into play until it is too late for them to be of much use.  We start games with 4 to 6 energy (instead of 2) and reduce the energy cost to wipe the face up cards down to 1 (from 2).

Really enjoy this game, and it is very easy to teach to a group.  If a group has never played either this or King of New York (KoNY), I would choose this to play first since it is a little more straight forward, and then might pull out KoNY if everyone enjoyed it.  Has a good middle ground between the light party gamers and the more serious board gamers that most everyone seems to enjoy.

Who doesn't like a good monster smash-up?
This is totally not my style of game, but I found it to be fun, thematic, and short enough to be interesting to kepp watching even after you've been KO'd. The cards should add enough powers and interest that you won't feel like you're playing the same battle over and over. Very much a dice-rolling slugfest. For some reason reminds me just a bit of Nexus Ops, but with simpler rules, and a more fun theme.

I want to like this game.  However, the 2-player version sucks with just a complete deathmatch, and the 4-player version feels like you don't get to accumulate cards and make much use of them.  

We tried a modification to play to 30 and not be kicked out after death, however, the game dragged way too long for the luck involved.  After a standard 4-player game, I guess the base rules are the way to go, but it feels a bit underwhelming.  By all means, I should like this more than Risk & Roll, but I'm not sure that I do.  Time will tell.

triple 1s indicates you've eaten pedestrians.
triple 2s indicates you've smashed vehicles.
triple 3s indicates you've destroyed buildings.

This seems to make them enjoy gathering points more.

But  I'm glad I tried it, for what it is it's actually very well done. There were more decisions involved than I was expecting and there is some process and tactics to those decisions. The cards were nicely designed too

Solid dice roller with a great theme of monsters smashing face. It's the perfect beer and pretzels game. Power Up expansion is a must and gives the game a lot more flavor and intrigue as well as balances it out a bit

Best with 4-5 and good with 3-6

““Nuclear waste turned him from a harmless grub into a 350 foot tall monster that attacked Tokyo.” - President Hathaway

GAMEPLAY
Players take on the role of giant monsters set on rampaging through Tokyo and bashing each other. Each turn the players roll 6 dice Yahtzee style with 2 re-rolls to build energy, attack other players, score victory points, and heal. The objective of the games is to build up 20 victory points or destroy all of the other monsters. Buying power cards with stored energy brings in victory points, augments your dice rolls, or interferes with other players. Stomping into Tokyo builds your victory points but it makes you the center of attention. The game board consists of only the single space (two for 5 to 6 player games) which creates the dramatic tension of the game mechanic. One of the great decisions mid-game after there are fewer players is whether to hold the middle. Games move quickly form turn to turn and none of my games has taken longer than 30 minutes to finish making it possible to play several times or as a filler while waiting for other people to show.

COMPONENTS
The art style is fun and evocative. Monster stands are of thick card and all the images have strong colors. I would have like to see miniatures for the monsters but that isn’t really the point of the game. The box insert is just right for the existing components in the box but there is already one expansion so I don’t think it will fit.

THEME
Giant monsters attack Tokyo. Simple, easy to understand and fun. Monsters are easy to recognize and mimic many trademarked monsters from movies through the decades. The power cards are all over the map from destroying building for victory points to getting an extra head for more dice rolling.

WHO IS IT FOR?
KoT is easy to bring out with a broad range of players. Young kids can enjoy this game. There is some reading involved but if the adults are keeping the game moving kids as young as 6 should have fun. The game is for 2 to 6 players and can get pretty wild with a full group. Because the game is short (20 to 30 minutes) and the rules are basic, it can be played with anyone passingly interested in sitting down. Monster noises encouraged.

RATING: 8
Okay, it's just Kaiju [i]Yahtzee[/i] with some game-nudging cards—but I'm a sucker for a glossy theme and this one is well-lacquered.  If you have trouble managing probability, hate player elimination or can't make serviceable giant monster battle sounds then stay away; otherwise know that it plays quickly and is a real hoot if everyone can get into the theme:

[microbadge=22861]  Full-throttle haymaker

[microbadge=22861][microbadge=22861]  Spartan-kicked through a city block

[microbadge=22861][microbadge=22861][microbadge=22861]  Clubbed with an aircraft carrier and raked with scintillating eye-beams

Note:  Somehow there are actually people alive who have never seen a Kaiju movie—not even [i]King Kong[/i].  When you say, "You know, like Godzilla," they stare blankly and say, "God-what?"

This seems like a light filler to me, the tactics are not that deep.  It lasts a little too long for that in my opinion, but it can be good fun.  One to play once or twice at the start or end of the night.  One petty complaint is that the constant sound of dice rolling gets inside my head and starts to drive me crazy.  I soft table covering makes this a lot quieter.

This game is fun, but for me I only enjoy it with the Power Up expansion. With the expansion I rate it around a 7.5 What irks me to no end is they released a new version of the game, and didn't bother to just include the Power Up expansion from the get-go, just to sell it later with the newer artwork

I would teach new players the expansion from the get go, since it makes each monster unique, and doesn't add crazy complexity. Base game is merely ok, and fun for the most part, but having played the game so much, it has definitely lost its luster.

An entertaining player-versus-player Yahtzee-like game.

If played with 2-3 people, the game is ridiculously short--no one is going to get to 20 VP; everyone except the King (whoever that is) is going to die. Game is over in 15 minutes.

I think I prefer it with more people if I actually want to play this--game lasts longer, gives you an actual choice on if you want to pursue collecting VP or try to wipe everyone else out. That being said, dice rolling isn't my general cup of tea so the idea of the game lasting longer does give me mixed feelings.

I liked this more than I expected.  It's VERY light, just a little dice game with cool components (and the cards to spice things up a bit).  But its purity and its push-your-luck nature make it very good at being what it is.  Now, what it is isn't the sort of thing that I reach for very often, but it could make a really nice filler.

As a fan of giant monster themed items and someone that likes Yahtzee, this was a logical choice to add to my collection. It contains a lot of flavor in the visual design and card effects, leading to a goofy fun time. Also has well-made game mechanics, making for a bit of strategy to the overall randomness of the dice rolls. It does have its issues, but their tends to be a counterargument for most. For example, being knocked out early in the game to watch everyone else play for a half an hour isn't much fun, but it also makes every action a tense and dramatic situation when every dice roll could be your last. In the end, though, its a game where you move around cardboard figures pretending to fight each other while destroying a major city, and that's fine by me.

By Richard Garfield. 3p, 4p, 5p or 6p. A dice game with fighting and player elimination. Similar to BANG! The Dice Game, but much worse. Gaining victory points is unexciting. Winning via victory points is unexciting. Too much in-game text. Minimize in-game reading by removing KEEP cards from the game and buying cards face down? Very difficult to see other players' victory points and life points. Use a scoreboard (/filepage/91464) and life tokens (like BANG! The Dice Game)? Energy in Tokyo variant: /thread/829859.

If you love monsters/kaiju, then King of Tokyo is a must have! The push-your-luck element is the core play mechanic, but the addition of equipment and action cards adds a fair amount of strategy as well. Fun with just two players or with a group, you can't go wrong here. King of Tokyo is a modern gaming staple, a status that's well-deserved.

Pick a monster, start with 10 health and get 20 points to win. On your turn roll 6 dice (1,2,3,health,$,attack). You get 3 chances to lock in the dice. 3 of any one number gets you that many skill points, each additional gets you one more skill point. (5 3's get you 5 points). Health heals you only outside of Tokoko. Attack attacks monsters opposite where your monster is (in or out of Tokoyo). Health drops below 0 and you're out. You get 1 point for attacking into Tokoyo and 2 pts making it a round in Tokoyo without coming out. The $ get let you buy cards with special ability.

RATING: 10
A perfect game. Can be taught to anyone, but can still be enjoyed by heavy gamers. It has conflict, pushing your luck in Tokyo, great cards, and dice with decisions! You can aim for points, for attacking, for energy (aka money for cards), or healing! Fantastic game. Doesn't quite work with 2 players, and the only criticism I have is that it doesn't matter what monster you pick, they are all the same (except the expansion fixed this!)

Wow! My boys are crazy for this game. I like it a lot too. If you have little boys at home, get this game. Who cares if it's not Caylus? It's just family fun.

My wife didn't like the idea of rampaging and smashing other monsters at first, but now she usually stomps all of us.

Great party game, where the yahtzee-style rolling of dice takes on the monster theme. Surprisingly enjoyed by the ladies, maybe because of the cuteness factor. Might not be everyone's cup of tea because of the randomness of the die.

I understand the attraction, but it's just not for me.  Too few decisions to be made on your turn.

And the player elimination is real.  Of course, it does add a nice touch of tension.

The dice are super nice and chunky.  There are a lot of cards for variety.  There are a couple win conditions.

You first think king-of-the-hill.  But really, it's more tug-of-war, and I dislike tug-of-war.

Nice yatzee style game, had to sell it because I moved and it didn't make the cut. I played KoNY and while I think it is a better game, it was way too long for what it is (to be fair, I played only once at a game store and I had to wait a long time for my turn to come back).

This is an amazing, fun, well-thought out game that everybody in my playing group enjoys. It is oozing with flavor, has a great Yahtzee mechanism that anybody can learn in five minutes but, yet, everybody loves it and doesn't tire of it. I also love that you can easily expand up to six players.

While on the casual side, this is one of my ten favorite games to bring out and play, and it works with any group.

Wonderfully thematic and colourful, this game really takes the Yahtzee mechanic to a new level.  Big dice, terrifying monsters and great card art all make this a great game for kids and families - well, if only it wasn't for the player elimination.

Normally I wouldn't be so bothered about players being kicked out, but this isn't a skill-based game and there simply shouldn't be any player elimination at all, particularly when considering the game is clearly aimed at youngsters and families primarily.

Recommended, but consider changing the rules to allow "dead" players to continue playing.

Basically Yahtzee with Kaiju-esque monsters fighting to reign over Tokyo - absolutely brilliant. The artwork and quirky design of components genuinely contribute to how FUN it feels to play this game. Buying cards to upgrade your own personal Kaiju to match your playstyle also feels very personal and rewarding. It's also incredibly accessible - No one I've introduced this to HASN'T understood or enjoyed it. It's a great party pleaser! While dice-rolling adds an interesting random element to the game, players still feel like they have more than enough control over the outcome of the game and they have the chance to make plenty decisions that can either make or break them. King of Tokyo offers simple, unsaturated fun!

RATING: 9
This is NOT King of Tokyo. It's a placeholder for the unlisted Kickstarter King of the Skippers from Tales of the Jungle Crews Podcast. It's a great game mechanic with similar play style to Asshole (or President) - the college drinking card game with thumbs and seats and stuff. I have the engraved wooden box edition with promo artwork cards and the promo postcards. Beautifully executed game!

I read the rulebook for this game before it came out and my first reaction was disappointment that someone (even if that someone is Richard Garfield) took a great theme like kaiju monsters and put a Yahtzee mechanic on it. But then I played it, and it really works! -- in large part because, unlike most Yahtzee variants, it has player interaction. This just blows away so many of the dice-rolling games I've played over the years. So quick and fun that I'm always up for a game. Fantastic art and components put it over the top.

My first real "dice chucker".  This (along with Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride) forms the core of my gateway games when I'm bringing new people into the fold.  Rules are simple but hands-on experience is the best way to grasp the central mechanic of occupying Tokyo.  I have yet to play with a group that doesn't ultimately yell and role play to some degree.  LOL.  Adding a dice tower seems to up the enjoyment, so I always bring one with me.

After 1 play.

There is still a chance that I'll have a desire to own it, but - realistically - it's a slim one.

For now I treat the game as a (very) light filler, providing some fun, just enough for me not to refuse the play when someone offers it with his own copy...
Novelty factor might play a role too, because I can imagine the game wear out after a few plays [to be verified].

Seems way overrated here on bgg.

Played twice and just a fun game, and done very well overall. Some cards and combos seem way too strong, but then in a 30 minute luck filled game played for fun I’m not sure if it bothers me, not too much I guess.  Not sure I would want to play with more than 4, might become too long for what it is, 3 or 4 seems good though. 

----------

WTF?  Garfield does a boardgame with a Yatzee mechanic and/but it turns out good?  LOL

King of the hill type game with some push your luck and special powers thrown in and decisions are actually somewhat interesting, sounds like it might be fun for a party game filler.  Edit - BUT the elimination can be off-putting for some that have to sit out and watch for 10/15 minutes. Should be a 7 or 7.5 for me still looks fun enough to play with non-gamers from the video I watched

Best I have done is 2nd in a 6 player game. Lost because I did not get the effect an acid drop card has on me every time I was attacked.

Treated as a light dice based filler, it is just about acceptable. As a game, how it compares so well to other games (even those using dice!) is beyond my comprehension. I guess some are easily pleased....... :)

I really wanted to like this one but we all agree that it is kind of boring and that there feels like there is no progression, just decay. The powers you get don't ever really feel worth it and winning feels like it is all about resisting the urge to do things that would actually be fun. The dice feel good in the hand though and I admire the design's cleanness. I also really like the art.

Bokkensprong 18/05/12 (met Jordy, Marleen en Dandy). Vlot actiespel met monsters en dobbelstenen (1, 2, 3, hartje, klauw of bliksem). Om het snelst 20 punten halen, maar opletten dat je blijft leven! 1,2,3 levert punten op, hartje geeft eigen levens bij, klauw doet levens weg bij tegenspelers die op andere locatie zijn dan jijzelf (i.e. in of uit Tokyo), bliksem is "geld" om speciale kaarten te kopen. Origineel; een dobbelspel dat ik leuk vind!

I REALLY like this game. For me, this is just the right amount of chaos and "take that" in a game and it has a TON of theme. I find myself standing around the table to see what people are rolling instead of sitting... good tension :)

Note though that I LOVE rolling dice and probability management. If you don't like randomness or chaos, look elsewhere.

A light version of Monsters Menace America. Quicker. Seems to have a flaw. It's generally better to avoid going into Tokyo and eschew fighting as much as possible.

I'm not a fan of games where players can be eliminated from the game... like Monopoly... and this is what this game was... came down to two players... lots of "take that" evolution and regular purchased cards, add to that the luck of the dice.  Other than theme, for some reason it also didn't feel very original.

Super easy game to get into with something new with each play. I find the victor actually has a different win condition. My favorite was when I was sitting with 18 victory points just waiting for my turn to hit again so that I could gain my last two, only to have the person before me roll an absurd amount of attack dice, killing me in the process.

This game is a fun romp between players and begs to be played multiple times in a session, as players get eliminated quickly and only a few special powers will be revealed and used. The game's over a bit too quickly for my tastes, but I really love the king-of-the-hill mechanics. Component quality is great, and it's good fun. I'm not sure it quite deserves all the hype it receives, though.

A disappointing slug-fest with two players, becomes chaotic and punishing with six. That said, very very quick and easy to learn which makes it a hit with kids and drunken adults alike.

The dice appear to be made of granite however, and every roll will deafen all players.

It wasn't perfect with two players, but it was good and fast enough to make us play five times in a row. Then we tried with six, and it was a blast.

A fairly random dice rolling game taht manages to be a lot of fun.  Players beat up on each other as they try to control Tokyo.  I think the second victory condition (points) is generally a second option to be taken when players are able to avoid being destroyed until they build up enough other abilities to stay alive, and it esentially places a time limit on the game, which is good.  Overall, a lot of fun in a simple game.

My only beef with this game, though it's a moderately big one, is visual—the life/victory dials are virtually invisible to the other players, which makes the game feel a lot less interactive than, in mechanical terms, it is. Nonetheless, if I were to buy a $30-$40 game for some totally random person and all I knew about them was that they kinda liked boardgames, this is probably the one I'd get.

Take on the role of a kaiju and beat up other kaiju and attempt to become the king of tokyo. Really fun, easy to explain and the power up expansion really gives each character its own flavor and differentiates them from the rest.

Plays very quickly but can get boring kind of fast. Without the power up expansion it becomes very bland as your choice of standee doesn't change much or make you feel any different from the rest.

Has the advantage over Yahtzee in terms of player interaction, but Yahtzee has the advantage in other categories: long-term planning, no player elimination, and it doesn't feature a theme I consider repugnant.

That this game gets all the love it gets in 2013, considering it's a very mediocre design that allows for player elimination and has very finicky 5-6 player rules, is beyond me.

Good familiar dice game. It is pretty easy to teach and learn. As everyone talked about this game I was expecting a great game, however I´m a little disappointed. Still I recognize it is a very good filler, but not my kind of game and I´m glad I sold my copy.

Its main strength is that is plays so fast, that you don’t care about the luck involved in it. Also due to its speed, the player elimination is not an issue. 

I´m pretty sure I will play it again as the game is fun from time to time.

After a couple of additional games, I have changed my mind, it has a lot of uncontrollable luck and it is very boring for me. The games takes araound 45m, way too long. If I don’t play KoT again it would be for the best. I will do my best to stay away from the game, however many in my game group really like it.

I like this game. Simple and straightforward, just monsters bashing the hell out of each other for control over Tokyo, Godzilla-style. I love the big dice you roll each turn to damage others, gain some life or some cash to buy special powers. Graphically speaking, I find the monsters a bit gross... but it's part of the cartoonesque un-seriousness of King of Tokyo! 2-player games are boring, and I think 6 is too much... I would say it's best from 3 to 5 players.

Estoy un poco decepcionado con este juego, esperaba que fuera más divertido.

El juego está sobreproducido (pero no incluye figuras) y te hace pensar que vas a jugar a un juego de la leche, pero no es así.

Los monstruos son similares, no tienen poderes especiales. No importa si juegas con el que se parece a King Kong ó con el que se parece a Godzilla, todos hacen lo mismo... esto es una gilipollez y está totalmente enfocado a lo comercial, porque sí han sido incluidos en la expansión.

Además, los jugadores pueden ser eliminados y el juego todavía sigue, creando situaciones tontas de 1 contra 1.

I´m a little bit disappointed with this game. I was expecting more fun.

Game is a little bit overproduced (but includes no figures) and that makes you feel that you going to play to an awesome game but it´s not.

Monsters are similar, no special powers. Doesn´t matter if you play with the King Kong-like character or the Godzilla-like one, they all do the same... that´s very stupid and completely commercial-focused, because they included it in an expansion.

In addition players can be eliminated and the game still goes on, creating not very fun situations 1 vs 1.

Ok game for playing 4-5 players.[/color]

A light, dice-rolling bit of silliness. Still fresh after a dozen plays. As always with Iello games, the components are top-notch. Just enough 'take-that' to satisfy a reasonable appetite for such play. Building up your monster's powers with cards is fun and crushing your competitors with them even more so. Highly recommended.

This game is great fun.  I believe it is noticeably better with 4 or 5 than with 2 or 3.  My experience is with lower number of players, the cards are little used.  In other words the game ends before many cards are bought or used.  With 4 or more, the cards seem to come into play a lot more, and they really change the flavor of the game.

I played this game one night with three kids and a bowl full of pretzels and no one wanted the game to ever end.  Again, I'm such a sucker for pretty games and this one is a beaut with lavish art work.  Seriously, this game is so purty, you just can't wait for another card to in the deck to be flipped.  Everyone laughed out loud while playing this game and customizing their monsters and destroying poor ol' Tokyo.  Simply a blast.

I know my rating on this game is lower than the norm and that if it had been released in the days when we played Yahtzee after dinner many evenings, King of Tokyo would have been AWESOME. But, alas, it didn't and so my rating is based on how interested I am in playing the game today. It just misses the mark for me because it has the feel of a filler with the length of something bigger when you play with enough players for it to be interesting.

RATING: 7.8
Here you each play a Japanese sci-fi monster battling it out with a handful of dice. Perfect filler, fast, fun, exciting, but good replayability with all those energy cards.
Also I think this wins the crown for smallest board ever (not just size but function - there is only one spot on the board in a 4 player game!).

GREAT little dice filler.  Tactics, strategy, press your luck...it's all here.  Plays great with 2-4, still a little confused on 5-6p rules (Tokyo Bay).  Some cards are not explained well in the rules, too, which can lead to arguments.  A very small quibble, though, on an excellent game!

Roll dice with two more rerolls possible. Dice can allow attacks, healing, or storing energy. Energy can be used to get cards that give you special abilities. Accumulate points by staying in Tokyo while others attack. Be the lone survivor to win. It is fun as a light warm-up game.

At first I was unsure of the game. It looks awesome, and it seemed kind of short. However, as time passed, and strategies came into play, the games were longer, and the cards made it more exciting. So as time passed it got better. 

Now I'm getting the first expansion, which I hope makes it even more interesting.

Finally a modern dice-chucking game that's actually fun. The artwork and components are a big plus. Some important balance is achieved by the fact that building a big lead is just begging the other players to kill you off. 

I recommend a variant to make the game faster and more interesting - deal each player a random 3-cost "Keep" card to start the game.

I had no intentions of playing King of Tokyo as this kind of silly random luckfest is not up my alley but a guy from the Iello booth at Spiel 2011 asked me to enter a game of it as they were looking for one more player. As expected, it's not my kind of game but for 20 minutes and considering the gorgeous art, it's ok. I had fun killing myself and reaching the victory condition of 20 VP at the same time by playing jetfighters. At that time, we all weren't sure if this made me the winner or first loser. In the mean time, I know that I lost the game but it didn't matter as it was the most fun part of the game.

This game is fun on so many levels! It was a breeze to teach to my cousins, and they speak English as a second language. Anyone can understand the monster theme, and the ability cards are so perfectly written that it's hilarious! It's a great value with amazing replayability.

I had to get the expansions after how amazing the core game is.

Update: I like what the expansions did to the game, but I find myself getting bored during my plays. I am beginning to gravitate toward more strategic games, and this one lacks the hidden information to keep it fresh. Still fun to play with the right crowd, but not what I remember

Not a bad game, but tends to be a bit predictable. 
The game is a glorified version of Yahtzee. You roll 6 dice multiple times, re-rolling only the ones you don't like. You can heal, gain victory points, or attack other monsters. You win the game by killing all of the other monsters, or by reaching 20 victory points. The game can be fun, but it needs people who can immerse themselves in the b-grade monster film theme, and not take things too seriously. Would recommend if you want to spend 30 mins playing a light-hearted game, but wouldn't recommend if you are looking for a strategy based game.

RATING: 6
Loved by many.  But really, it's just an attack version of yahtzee.  Roll your dice (up to three times) and either hit, heal, or gain energy to buy extra powers.  There is some strategy (do I stay in the city or get out, which dice should I re-roll) but it is not terribly intense or profound.  Willing to play but will almost never ask for it myself.

RATING: 4
While King of Tokyo is certainly a popular game, most likely due to it's theme, it's not a very good game.  There is very little incentive to actually put your monster into Tokyo.  You have a target on your chest while everyone else sits back and licks their wounds.  The game often turns into a roll off for who gets what the need first to win.  On top of that, this game is not as good as its sequel: King of New York.

King of New York has more for the player to do.  You have greater incentive to be in Manhattan than Tokyo.  There is more fighting, and you can't sit back and bide your time. Cards are more important in KoT than KoNY.  Since there is less to do in KoT, buying and using cards has a bigger role; you have more time to buy and use them.

This game is a little simpler, so a lot of people argue that it's better to start new players on KoT and graduate them to KoNY, but that's crap.  KoNY isn't too difficult for new players to understand.  Just skip straight to the better and more interesting game.  The only reason to own KoT is if you need to collect different monster tokens.

I love the dice rolling and the power card, and especially the theme. However, it seems that what the game incentivizes is the three-of-a-number point scoring, and that is far from the most fun.

What a simple but fun game!  I have only played with 6 but I don't think I would suggest it with < 4 players. Everyone had a good time; gameplay was quite even between people trying to hurt each other and help themselves.  Player elimination can stink but fortunately the game is quick so there shouldn't be excessive downtime for the players who are knocked out early.  The cards provide really fun and diverse special abilities and will keep the game fresh for a while.  I can understand the popularity of this and am glad I bought it.

Be a monster, roll dice, beat up other monsters and become the King of Tokyo. This game took the basic Yahtzee-mechanic, added a theme, interaction and cards and combined them into a modern classic. Even better with the Power Up! Expansion.

RATING: 6
Using a Yahtzee-like dice mechanism players roll for points, attacks (which lower the life gauges of other players), healing (which raises your own life gauge), and energy (with which you buy efficiency boosts and one-shot effects). Symmetry is broken by one player being "in Tokyo", which yields additional points at the cost of increased vulnerability. Play goes on until one player reaches a score threshold or all players but one have been eliminated. The game can nominally be played with two, but should be played with three or more to take advantage of multiplayer dynamics like opportunity costs and asymmetric valuation. While it's true that rolling well is good strategy, the game is lively and not too long.

OK, so I see the potential in it, I see why it could be a great game, but meanwhile we only had a chance to play it with 2 players, and it is just not so much fun. We love the design, the cartoon like feeling, we love that it is a light and quick game, but we need to have at least one more player... 

Update
With 3 players it was FUN! We maneged to play it with our eldest son (6yo - so we had to help him a lot, but we finally understand why it is a great game). He still constantly wants to play with it :)

RATING: 6
Excellent game IF you also play with the Power Up expansion. Otherwise just a 6.

KoNY is said to finally get its own Power Up expansion so it'll finally be a superior version (right now KoT + PU = KoNY).

KoT is a great, simple dice rolling game. Sadly enough there are some problems with it that have kinda soured it for me. Stuff like more players = strength of the very dull VP/stars strategy rises. The fun bit of the base game, the ability cards, being way too expensive. Going for a battle build being totally useless by the time you get a decent loadout. And so on.

Still, great little filler. I don't want it in my own collection but I like it well enough :)

This is a modern classic, I think this will be a game that will be played for generations.  Fast, fun push your luck dice game.  Anyone who can play yahtzee can learn this game, but you don't get to destroy cities or battle giant monsters in yahtzee.  Great gateway game, great kids game, great filler game.

After a lot of plays it is not that interesting anymore. If played once in a session it is indeed an excellent filler game.

The evolution cards from the expansion make the game more interesting but i am not sure if they are balanced (Alienoid seems a bit weak). Best way to play with evolution cards is to mix them all together and do card drafting.

Only played this one twice so far, but it fell flat both times.  Still trying to see why this has so many positive reviews.  Willing to give it some more tries, but just did not feel like there were any interesting decisions to be made... keep or reroll, stay in Tokyo or "abdicate" as I like to say.  I know it's a filler and a family game, but doesn't seem like there's much here.

This is a fun concept that is executed poorly. I hope the cards and gaining energy were more balanced. Some cards are horrible while cards that cost even 1 more energy are overpowered.

One of my groups likes this quite a bit but with high player counts the player elimination is not great. In 6 player games I have sometimes seen about 30min waits if you are the first eliminated.

I totally adore this little game.  It finds play at almost every get-together.  Such a fun and fast game... it is almost a party game.  It is my go-to filler game and is good with almost any group.

Great little game. Short and fun for all the family when played in the right spirit. 

My wife really enjoys this. Six plays in the two days since I taught her the game. Tonight we sat in the garden, a ccol glass of cider each, playing it. Pretty good way to finish off a weekend. Any game that has my wife wanting to play that much is worth it's buy price twice over.

Also own Cthulu and King Kong expansion characters.

RATING: 7
An amazing game with a very easy to teach and learn rule set.  Artwork / production quality is good, but my game came with some very irritating blotches in quality.  I did however get replacement parts free of charge so I'm going to grade the game as if these were non-issues.  The game itself plays out really fast, and with lots of dice rolls.  Very good gateway game for people to get into gaming who generally would shy away from heavy rule sets and lots of thinking.  I'd say it's kid friendly enough, and plays well no matter how many players there are.  Only downside is, if you are a bit more of a heavy gamer, the game is a lot farther down the lighter side of gaming than I personally would like.  I'm more a medium weight player myself.

Due to the ease of setup and retention factor of this game, it would still probably be one of my most played games in general groups.  So it will always have a place on my shelf.  I just wished it had a bit more bite considering the hype surrounding it.  The game's only flaw is that there is nothing but good things about it, just not enough of it.

Based on one four-player game.  A fitting description might be "Yahtzee on steroids".  It really comes down to rolling six dice and saving the best individual dice over three successive rolls.  Then with the results you gain a combination of health, energy (money), hits on another monster(s) and/or victory points.  The game also includes card that you can purchase which provide varous powers or points (health/life).  A very light game that anyone can play.  It was fun and I'd certainly play it again.  Not sure if I need to own it though.

Card mechanics are as solidly designed as you'd expect from Garfield, but the edge cases of randomness (a player can deal six damage to you with a lucky roll, but almost certainly won't, but might) add a little too much push-your-luck uncertainty to the end of an otherwise tactical combo-building game.

Simple dice rolling game that is a good gateway game. Basically a themed game of Yahtzee. You can pick different monsters but they are all the same, which is boring. The expansion fixes this and I wouldn't play this game without it. Would recommend to people looking to get into the hobby.

Great quick game that completely replaced yahtzee in our house. Same dice rolling mechanic with a lot more flavor bits in with it. Many plays already. Only down side in a big group is player elimination. I think a house rule will be implemented to wipe points, energy and cards and start next round with something like 5 health will be implemented.

Cute theme.  My first game was with 6 people.  Ran about an hour, which was okay, but I'm glad it didn't go any longer.  Fun chaotic warlike.  Worth a few more plays!

Acquired in 2012. Fun game! It's quick, has high replay value, and the theme fits very well with the game mechanics. With the right crowd, it is a hoot and has that one-more-game feeling! Played 72 games to date (although sadly none in 2016.) The Power Up expansion is indispensable!

Great small 30-45 min game.  Good for a low-key group of people.  Game is based on dice rolling so luck is a large part of the game.  That being said it is still very fun to play. Nothing terribly confusing about it and it can be taught in 10 minutes with a few "fake rolls/turns".  Not a whole lot for strategy, this can be used as a gateway. Normally will use this game to break the ice into other games on game night with newer gamers, it is good for indicating if the newer gamers are capable of stepping into a deeper game or if you need to stay at this level of strategy.

Alright, it's Kaiju Yahtzee, but so what? It's fun. Definitely not meaty enough for a main course, but as a family filler it does a decent enough job. There are some strategic choices to be made here, and they definitely have an impact on the outcome of the game. I would say that the expansion, Power Up, is a necessary addition to the game. It differentiates the monsters, which is what the base game lacks.

Bijatyka wśród potworów przy pomocy kości ze wsparciem w postaci kart. Dla dzieci i grających z nimi dorosłych. Mocno losowa jednak karty umożliwiają lekkie modyfikowanie losowości. Widoczne pewne podobieństwa do SW Przeznaczenia - PwT wstępem do grania w SWP ;)
Aktualizacja 11.09.2017 Plus dla Egmontu - zapytałem czy mają jeszcze karty promocyjne (10szt) które kiedyś dodawali do przedsprzedaży i okazało się że gratis wyślą mi je jeżeli potwierdzę zakup dodatku (który miałem właśnie kupić i napisałem by wysłali jedną paczką jak by mieli te karty). Wysłali oddzielnymi przesyłkami ale promoski gratis. Naprawdę miło. Taki np Portal wysłał mi promki których niepotrzebowałem (oraz te które już u nich kupiłem) w podziękowaniu za 14h wyrwanych z życiorysu (choć nie żałuję bo było fanie). A nie, faktycznie, to IT kazał się odezwać mailem bo przyszedłem z instrukcją statków do podpisu dla synka - czyli te 14h +paliwo+wejściówka(miała być gratis) było za czerwoną koszulkę :) A to przepraszam. Chociaż koszulka fajna.

RATING: 8
The gameplay is kind of light, and the monsters are identical except for the graphics. But it's a fun theme with great components. The way you get to customize your monster throughout the game by giving it new powers is a lot of fun. Although some of the powers synergize SO well that they break the game. And the game doesn't play very well with only 2 people, which is unfortunate because due to player-elimination, it's very likely to become a 2-player game at some point.

I'd consider myself a pretty gateway gamer, but I don't enjoy this game. It's often compared to Yahtzee which I find quite boring but at least when you roll you are going for different outcomes every time and your options narrow down as play continues making the game more dynamic. Here's it's just roll for whatever you really want every time. The amount of luck and lack of skill in this game is what really gets to me. Some interesting things start to happen when cards come into play, but just when the game seems like it might be getting interesting it always comes to an abrupt end. Many players forego acquiring cards altogether only adding more monotany to the game. Then there's the downtime and player elimination which can lead to a back and forth tug-of-war just to end the game. Nobody in my gaming group have seem all that enthused by the game either. I might recommend this game for children and families. I do generally dislike dice games and games of chance, but I actually own and enjoy Bang! The Dice Game which I feel scratches the same itch, only better.

Fun Dice game, but VP is a pointless Strat, this game is all about getting out of Tokyo and trying to survive.

Perhaps if you were granted more VP for going in and staying a full round in Tokyo it would work better. I have played 3 times and yet to have anyone get closer than 8 points from Victory before someone died instead to end the game.

Roll dice, roll dice some more.  This game features elimination, which is not a good thing, especially since the final 2 can stretch on for a while.

The theme is the saving grace, it is rather enjoyable.  You do get a bit of a monsterly feel, especially when hurting people.

This game is surprisingly fun. After years of not picking it up, I finally did. It's interesting to see how things play out. You have a luck factor, but also a strategy factor. Roll dice, but keep what you think will benefit you. The game also moves very quickly and even when you get eliminated, the end game lasts no more than 5 minutes. It's funny to watch two players duke it out for king of tokyo, leaving tokyo when they can.

This is a local favorite. I carry this with me at all times, because inevitably someone asks to play it. It accommodates a large group of players, and is relatively light on the thinking, you roll dice, keep what you want, roll again, keep more, roll one last time. What you do and how you play is completely up to you, it's open ended strategy, first to 20 victory points wins, BUT, you can kill all your opponents, and voila, you win. A nice card market buying element keeps the games fresh, as your experience can change based on what you buy. Art is top notch.

The game looks great, is super thematic, easy to teach and fun. It's your usual Yahtzee-like, but this time with a giant monster theme. And the mix works! It's a very light-hearted, take-that kind of game. The downside is that there aren't all that many decisions to be taken, so it's mostly a matter of how much you can press your luck. I prefer [thing=143741][/thing], which scratches the same itch, but doesn't play itself as much as King of Tokyo does.

Still, good if you're in the right mood, and probably great to introduce non-gamers to the hobby.

great fun, family style dice game. The mechanics are similar to Yahtzee except you are monsters fight to control Tokyo. Each player has a chance to attack other players in or out of tokyo, buy power up cards, heal or take VPs. The game play is that of king of the hill. The longer you maintain tokyo, the more points you'll get. 

While the game is fun for light or moderate gamers, I had a few issues with the game. Some of the cards are game-changingly ambiguous. meaning if someone reads a card one way, it could totally change the game and the outcome. The explanation of cards in the game is rather lacking. Also, the monsters are all the same. There is no reason to pick one over the other. I think one of the expansions changes this, but it should have been in the base game IMO.

Definitely recommend though if you are looking for a fun, light family dice game.

This game I have tried and tried to love.  I feel like I've house ruled it to death trying to fix completely broken mechanics.  It really should b 4+ players, if it's 3 or less it becomes just a race to V.P.'s and the cards ( best part of the game in my opinion ) become a waste of time.  If you do play with 2-3 my suggestion is best 2 out of 3 and energy+cards carry over every game.

Big dice, cool theme, great artwork for the win.  The game is simple, you want to get the victory point goal first.  You are enticed to get to that goal faster by trying to stand on Tokyo, but the trade off is everyone gets to beat up your character while you are there.   I think this is a very clever game and It won't take long to teach it to anyone, while at the same time it has enough variety that multiple strategies can be taken to achieve your goal.

Too many decisions are made for you in this game. If you're low on health, roll for health etc. Not terrible but not exciting either. 

Edit:
I started ignoring points and rolling only for attacks and health. Then, I would bail the second I was hit in Tokyo. I made this switch and won the next 3 games I played, and decided I didn't want to play anymore. Points are useless if people attack like they should. The problem with this is I had zero decisions. We're talking less decisions than Yahtzee, because in Yahtzee you have to decide what you're rolling for. In KOT you just see how many hits and health you roll.

I'd typically rate it a 7 for its low amount of strategy and high luck, but due to the how much fun we always have playing it and the regularity it gets to the table, it has earned an honorary 8.

The second best Yahtzee variant I've played right after Alien Frontiers. Lucky of course, but hey, it's a filler. Loads of fun take that -combos to unleash. As a filler the player elimination part is a bit problematic, the endgame between the last few players can drag for too long. 

Edit: downgraded after I got introduced to Bang: The Dice Game

Fell completely flat for all of us playing. Player elimination is probably the biggest problem I had with the game. I also felt most of my decisions in the game weren't that interesting and luck of the dice rolls seemed to control the game more than anything else.

I feel King of Tokyo is a great game, but I wouldn't play it all night long :p I really  enjoyed it, played it a couple times with I think halloween outfits? And I feel those are a bit too random though. But the artwork is beautiful, the game plays fast and fun, too bad about the player elimination ^^

Player elimination can be a bit of a drag, especially since it seems to happen to new players as they try to stay too long in Tokyo, but is usually mitigated by the fact that game itself plays out pretty quickly. Like any dice game, luck plays a factor, but it's still a great warm-up game.

The most-played game in my house. Its quick playing time means we can play 3-4 matches in an afternoon. This is the dice game that has meaningful choices, plus wonderful art and great mechanic. We play with my house rule of drafting cards like 7 Wonders (which is the only house rule I use for my games, increased game value tremendously) and ban some over-powered cards to keep balance and make the draft fresh every time.

At the start of each turn, you roll six dice. The dice show the following six symbols: 1, 2 or 3 Points of Destruction, Energy, Healing and Whack. Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win destruction points, hoard energy, restore health, or whack other players into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory.The fiercest player will be crowned King of Tokyo... and will end up facing all the other monsters alone!Top this off with special cards purchased with energy that have a permanent or temporary effect, such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor, nova death ray, and more.... and it's one of the most explosive games of the year!In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 destruction points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended.

RATING: 4
Played once, 5p.  I do not understand a bit of love this game gets.  This is one step up from random dice rolling.  The theme is paper thin; I never once felt it was about monsters duking it out in Tokyo.  It was simply about rolling dice to get a decent result.  My decisions were which dice to keep/re-roll, whether or not to leave Tokyo (I never had that choice to make), and if I should buy a new power (this was almost always an obvious choice).  This is really a themed version of Can't Stop with an additional random element - the special powers.  Very weak.

This is basically a dice fest filler.  Fun, wacky, with special powers that can be purchased with acquired energy cubes.  First to 20 wins.  Lots of chaos, limited planning, luck of the roll but like yahtzee, you can roll your dice up to three times.  Plays up to 6 as well.  Easiest set of instructions you'll see outside of perhaps Blokus?  I'd play this to open or close an evening any time.

A great filler game filled with surprises and fun. The cards are what really make this game tick, and I think giving players 2 cards to start would even up the ante with this one. The components are top notch.

[u]Comments Update:[/u]
While i initially saw the genius of the pure awesomeness that is KoT, I didn't understand how long lasting that awesomeness could be. I spent most of the GenCon 2013 playing this game just to get a stupid Space Penguin, and even though I didn't win a single game of the 20+ games that I palyed during the con, I enjoyed every single second of it. That says something awfully loud about this game.

I hate most dice rolling games that are not RPGs. But, this one is pretty fun. The concept and customization of your monster makes it a decent dice rolling game. If I had kids, I bet that I would have to play this all the time after they understand the mechanics of yahtzee.

I think this is the single most popular game in my game group. If we want to play something, but don't know what to play, this is one of our go to games. This game is fun and really short. All the rules can be explained in the matter of minutes and there is practically no set up time. There is no one way to win and relies luck with a minimal amount of thinking so there is no guaranteed strategy to win, giving it a fair amount of replay value. I would recommend it especially for people with short attention spans or are just too tired to focus on a game for too long.

Fun light game in a Beer and Pretzels atmosphere.  The Yahtzee dice mechanic is simple, attacking other players is fun, and there's enough strategy in deciding to attack, heal, earn energy, or go for points.  Once everyone knows the game it seems to drag.  the correct strategy involves healing as much as possible which just lengthens the game.  Especially with Power Up.  Need to try King of New York, which supposedly has quicker player elimination.

What a blast!  Very easy to learn and while two can play this game, it works better with the more people you have. The seemingly infinite amount of ability cards can tilt the game over the course of a turn or two, which is great.  Yes, someone who is getting their doors blown off can make a full recovery (with the right dice rolls and proper cards) to make a comeback.  It happened to me...sadly I wasn't the one making the comeback.  I was the one kicking tail then eventually got wrecked and lost.

I'm kind of on my own when it comes to King of Tokyo in my group.

It just doesn't get any love. It may be that my group is directly split between theme and euro players.

The thematic guys want something a bit more exciting, and the Euro guys want something considerably less lucky.

It's a shame because I really enjoy the simple brilliance of KoT. Then again, I like Bang! Dice game as well so I guess these short dice games work for me specifically.

This game has it's ups and downs. Sometimes we get games where everyone has fun and it's all a back and forth, but other games it's a complete one sided devastation by one or two players and the rest are just stomped over and not having fun. I don't suggest playing this with younger kids who have issues with losing or taking things personally. It can be a good tool to teach those qualities but if they are too young this can just end in tears.

This game is ok. It's fun, but too much downtime in between players (I play with 6 people) and too much luck for my taste. I enjoy luck but this is almost entirely based on it.

I've been intrigued by King of Tokyo as a nice, colorful filler game and finally got a chance to play it.  We've typically not been huge fans of dice games, but this one seemed to work better as it was short and sweet.  Yes, it can be random, but it is fun to try and play king of the mountain.  What makes the game is not the dice---it's the cards, which give each player a more unique identity with special abilities.  The unique abilities gives the game a lot more replayability and fun, so I'm eager to give the expansion a try as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really fun lightweight (family) game.  There's a fair amount of luck because the game's mostly based on the dice rolls, which the yahtzee rules (re-roll up to twice) helps mitigate SOMEwhat.  The real reason that's ok is that a game only takes 20-30 minutes, so you just play again.  

The theme is really goofy, monsters beating each other up and eating a city.  My wife didn't think she would like it (ugh, monsters? I'm not a little boy), but actually she DID after she played it, and we played 2 more times.

The meat of the game is in all the cards you can buy.  Good fun stuff.  My one complaint is that, since there's only 3 of them, you can really get a bad lot, and it costs 2 energy to recycle them :-(

I love the components.  The semi-translucent green energy cubes, the really meaty dice, the ultra simple gameboard (which also summarizes the 3 effects of being in tokyo).  The cardboard stand-up things for your monsters--ok, not as awesome as miniatures--but it makes the game cheaper and I actually like that move for this particular game, even though normally I wouldn't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Tastes of the boardgame tribe change as fast as a victory point wheel turns.  When I started getting involved in this hobby dice and early elimination were practically forbidden.  Now they seem to be de rigueur.  However, I am always slow to keep up and they are not yet to my tastes (give me another year when everyone has moved on).

However, the artwork, quality of dice and flavour of the cards are excellent.  Plus though it is only a narrow choice of decisions they are real and get the brain warmed up.

Fun but lacking substance.

Very great gameplay with pretty poor components (curved bent cards straight from the box, unrefined painting of dices, character score plate trackers are very loose, some characters cardboard standees are bent on the edge) and an unclear rule book.

30x plays (7)

The game get deeper beyond the surface, its eveb more entertaining. However the components could not keep up and further question the quality and material involved.

A die chipped a bit on the edge. 
The cards need sleeves to shuffle better. 

Pretty boring when played with 2p but it's better with variants from BGG forum.

This is another one where the theme just gets me. I really want to make a custom character that I can use for the Hulk. That would be sweet. I won one of the hourly Origins tournaments a few years back, so I have the Space Penguin promo character, which is cool. Also, giant dice are pretty awesome.

UPDATE: I REALLY have to be in the right mood for this. Every game feels the same.

It's a dice chucker that can be played in 20 minutes even at full player count. There's a very MINOR tactic of attacking to take over "the hill" and when to duck out. Otherwise it's just dice.

It's appeal as a gateway game or filler game is evident, and it's aesthetic charm is undeniable.  However, all of that is the hallmark of a game that doesn't have much game.  Be aware of what your needs are when you get this game.  Is it a monster smash-up game?  Not so much.  Is it the very definition of beer-and-pretzels?  Very much so.

RATING: 8
The game is basically dice rolling and hoping but that is fun in a filler. The cards you can buy to change up and individualize your particular monster have a nice variety of powers and my card combo brain churns away looking for synergy.

That said, the game is pretty random. Getting eliminated is not a big deal - even if you get KO'd early, I have seen folks mentioning the simple variant of re-entering the game with a fresh monster. And in any case, it usually short enough that the elimination is not a problem.

Part of me yearns for a bit more control of what happens on a turn. Perhaps a way to give a more steady income of energy points (the game currency) so the cards can get into play? It would also be cool to distinguish the monsters from the outset rather than as they buy powers - is it as simple as giving everyone some cash to spend at the beginning? Or setting a power card for each monster (something thematic)?

Anyway, I bought this for a game that my 8 year old would love and that part has paid off handsomely.

We first played it with just the two of us (me and wife) - it was ok.  We had to modify the rules so that you only get one point each turn you start in Tokyo.  Then we played it with more people, and it was way better.  Lots of fun.  One game I was eliminated super early (was the first person into Tokyo, but then stayed in too long), so I was stuck watching the game from the sideline, but it was still a lot of fun.  Weird.

You are a monster trying to destroy all other monsters in the game. You do this by rolling dice and attacking other monsters, healing or gaining energy which allows you to buy special cards that provide unique powers.  If you score a certain number of points or defeat all other monsters, you win.  

Very light, very fun family weight game.  It is a dice game and you get multiple rolls but good rolls can win the game for you and poor rolls will lose it.  Even with this, the game is short (about 30-45 min) and great fun.  Card play adds a unique dynamic to the game.

RATING: 9
Wow, this is a great dice game.  Theme and mechanics are a great match.  Love the king of the hill dynamic of moving in and out of Tokyo.  Also, this game does not have the problem of many conflict-oriented games where 'take-this' and 'take-that' is chosen by individual players for semi-random or metagaming reasons, because damage is dealt based solely on whether you are in or out of Tokyo.  There is player-elimination, but games are generally pretty short, so not so big of a deal.

The components are by no means overproduced--ignore comments to that effect.  If the monster figures were life-size and stomped around during their turns and when Cyber Bunny causes Complete Destruction two turns in a row for the win (*cue triumphant sounding metal music* \m/), the whole building in which the game was being played and all other players were destroyed, then *that* would be overproduced components.  Anything less is merely adequate.

I play it because my daughters (8 & 11) loves it, but in honesty, I think it's takes too long, for a game that random. Most of the time, it takes about 1 hour, and that is about x2 as long as it deserves.

I would only play it in an adult group if we were all seriously hammered.

Really like the theme and the production on this game and works as a great filler if you keep it to 4 players. It plays with a competitive spirit, lots of interaction and the key choices are how far to push your luck and which tech cards to acquire. It does on occasion drag on a bit, and that risk increases above 4 players, especially bearing in mind this is a player-elimination game.

RATING: 7
Some of the cards in this game seem unbalanced at first, but on further reflection I think it's a case that when the powerful cards come out, players need to work as a group to punish the players that take them; a conservative game will let the luckiest player win, whereas an aggressive game lets skill play a deciding role (though of course, the aggression needs to be managed).

I seem to be born to lose at this, after being one of the first two eliminated in my first four games. Nevertheless, this is fun.

One caveat is that the 5-6 player option feels tacked on, and is not sufficiently well explained in the rulebook. I'd suggest playing with exactly 4 players only.

Main problem is the "last man standing" mechanic that in my opinion is a flawed mechanic since many players become spectators, then bored, then drift away, defeating the social aspect and interaction that I seek when I play board games.  The high score is because the game is a lot of fun, quick, easy to teach, and I would not turn it down in spite of the flawed mechanic and the fact that I am not usually a fan of dice rolling (again a testament to the strength of the game).  A classic and also a great gateway game.

What a disaster this game is. I thought that we were freed from the Monopoly "play until you are the only one left over", but some people insist on playing bad games.

Dice rolling, and trying to stab down your opponents in an idiotic simple way. Maybe too many people recognize the game they play in daily life in this hyped game that i will refuse to play from now on. 

Good for people that don't know where to get rid of their aggression towards each other, but not good for me. No thank you.

Richard Garfield delivers yet again.  This light dice game of fighting kaiju is anything but shallow.  Luck is a huge factor, almost as big as the dice and monsters themselves, but there is a constant weighing of odds and serious strategic decisions that make this short game a blast.

RATING: 7
Harmless fun, with the emphasis on fun, so I certainly won’t complain. A marriage between King of the Hill and Yahtzee, the big and bold production really makes the theme go to 11. On the other hand, the price point resulting from this is a bit of a hurdle to making an impulse purchase, but I’ll definitely and gladly play another one’s copy again.

Traded away in 2014, but reacquired in 2016 because the box caught my son's eye every time we went past it in Target.  Should be a hit.

(Comments from 2013) I don't consider this an essential game for my collection and I don't think anybody I've introduced it to has been completely enamored.  It's a decent, light filler, but I have a ton of those already.  Power up expansion is absolutely required to make this more interesting.

Always a top pick at family game night, KoT is a staple in both our house and my game group. Great as either a filler or a tournament game, it's immensely entertaining. The oversized dice are a great touch and the monster standees make it easy to get into the game. The "keep 1 and roll the rest" mechanic ensures that players gain something on every turn and the energy, points and attacks ensure everyone can take their own path to victory.

So fun.  So easy to make up house rules on the fly.  Also it's just been a great way to hook in non-gamers.  Seems like everyone likes pretending to be a monster for at least a little while.

Don't play too many games too close together.  It can get a bit dull for a gamer after too many plays.

This is a themed version of yahtzee, nothing more that makes it interesting or worth the 30 minutes to play.

I have no idea why this game gets such good reviews.

UPDATE: I have heard that this game was submitted as an entire design and then the publisher split it up into a bunch of pieces so that they could make more money. To the extent that even the designer doesn't know what the pieces are, I will give it another shot once they release all the pieces of this game. Until then it remains crappy themed yahtzee.

Very Chaotic.  You'll have to enjoy chanting your desired roll as you shake the dice, trash talking with your opponents, and reading the clever titles of the cards.  If you don't, there's not really much of a "game" here.  Love the art, the theme, etc.  All very cute.  But those rolls will ultimately determine the winner, and many of the cards are "swingy" or just basically "rewind" the game and make it longer.  You'll have to be ok with that.  Don't get me wrong - many people are ok with that, and with the right group I don't mind a fun, colorful, nicely-themed dice fest if it's not too long.  Just be aware that this is what King of Tokyo is.

RATING: 4
Great components - lame gameplay. Too unbalanced. There is a huge discrepancy between life points and required victory points, thus killing each other is the only feasible option (House rule #1: when taking control of Tokyo you gain 2 VP, when starting your turn in Tokyo you gain 3 VP). The cards are, also, very costly. No more than 4-6 cards are ever played in each game (House rule #2: you get 2 energy cubes instead of one with each energy result). All of the above could be forgiven, if the theme existed. Unfortunately, there is no feeling of rampage in Tokyo.

In essence it's a children's game. Indeed, my son loves it, my daughter likes it, so... it's rather ok I guess.

----------------------------
UPDATE: I now always use house rule #2 and my overall impression has significantly improved. If this was an official rule, I would rate it a 6!

Hmm. This game has great review but after playing the game twice, my gaming group did not find it as good as we had expected. Maybe because our expectation were too high, or maybe because it needs the right gaming group to play. Nevertheless, I can see how this game could appeal to people who love luck based games with slight strategy and lots of social interaction. Should work well as a family game.

What a fun game.  Simple to learn.  Easy to play.  And while some people suggest that it's Yahtzee with a theme, I think it's much more than that.

Highly recommended.  A ton of fun!

RATING: 9
King of Tokyo is such a beautifully done Kaiju themed, dice driven battle, and variable power card drafting game that creates a new experience with every play.  The re-playability of this game is quite high with the end of every game (especially with new players) having at least one person saying, "lets play again".  What makes it so re-playable is its shortness with play time 30 minutes or less and its deck of variable powers that can be bought leading to different strategies.  The simplicity of the main game mechanic with Yahtzee style of re-rolling die to either do battle, power up, regain health, or gain victory points is so elegantly done that its luck factor feeling is reduced to nothingness.  It is good for all ages, for experienced gamers, and people you'd like to have enjoy gaming at its best for the first time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The base game is... not really fun.

It's more boring-er than Yahtzee, and Yahtzee's pretty boring. Pro-tip game designers: if you're going to have players play different characters (especially cool ones, like big, scary monsters), have them all have different powers. Now, I've heard the first expansion does exactly this, but seriously? Variable player powers should definitely have been part of the original game. Leaving it out, just so it could be an expansion is pretty weak-sauce if you ask me.

While I do not see why people rave about this game, it still is pretty fun and quick to play. I feel that games have evolved pretty far from a themed yatsy which this game essentially is, but there still is some allure in rolling dice and hoping for the best.

RATING: 8
Fun game that is easy to play and teach, but people are often scared to go into Tokyo.  There is also no variety to the monsters other than their design.  The Power Up expansion is a necessity because heart rolls are no longer useless when your monster is in Tokyo and it adds variety to all the monsters.

This game also has elimination so if someone dies early they may have to wait a while for the to end to play another round or a different game.

This game has become to be a fixture in our group.  It's great filler as a warm-up, cool-down, or kill time while waiting for the other group to finish.  

It is totally overproduced and true to the theme, which really works.  The game itself is simple, but it has enough choices and push your luck to not be trivial.  Moreover, the cards let you generate combos which are hilarious to watch.  They can get overpowered, but the games are short enough that it isn't an issue.

Probably still my favorite boardgame of all time, if not counting Magic. And also the game that opened my mind to dice. I've always been opposed to dice, as they are usually used only for rolling for "good or bad stuff", instead of possibilities as with cards. But Kings of Tokyo, with it's light strategy, gives you possibilities with the dice. You can still roll badly, but you have to be really unlucky and it will rarely set you back much. It's just a really good gateway game that's easy to understand, super silly, has a good amount of luck, but still not so much that the game feels too random (like Fluxx or Munchkin). The player elimination part is also a good introduction to, what we in my groups call, "Gentleman Play" - not being a dick towards someone just because you can. I cannot praise this game enough and I will probably never get tired of it.

Hard not to like this little gem. Sure, it won't win awards for strategy requirements. Nor will it win props for its deep play.

Quite a hoot - a game you can play 3-4 times in a row without growing tired of it.

RATING: 4
I love the theme and artwork, but I feel the balance / mechanisms of this game are off in quite a few ways:
1) 2-player game completely does not work (bgg ratings reflect this with >80% not recommended, so I won't elaborate).
2) Victory points in center are not proportional to # opponents / allies. So I feel far too little bonus for 4-player game, and far too much for a 2-player game. This changes as players are eliminated, but doesn't make it balanced.
3) Game can be won without ever fighting! This makes me sad since I've seen it happen several times, and it contradicts the entire theme.
4) Power cards feel pretty imbalanced (e.g. sometimes costs most of 2 rounds to get a decent card, other times 2 cheap cards combine to give an easy win).
5) Decisions rarely substantial/difficult. Most of the time my initial roll narrows my reasonable strategic choices pretty drastically (at most one or two possibilities). So I don't feel I'm playing the game nearly as much as the dice are. To be fair, the cards add a bit to this (if multiple are useful). Choosing when to exit Tokyo is usually not a hard choice though.

FWIW I have high-ish win rate (~50% for 4-5 player games) against more serious gamers than myself, so I doubt I'm missing something. Maybe just need to treat the game as a light social activity and not look for depth here.

Updated - After playing it a couple times with my kids, I have to bump it up a point.  The special ability cards are what make this a fun game to play. The overproduction of it is what makes my kids want to play it in the first place. So I can't say thats really a bad thing.  I still don't see it as being a great game, but it is pretty good and fun to play.

Uhhhmmmm, trying to understand the BGG ranking on this one is a bit of a head scratcher.  It's a cute enough game that is fun, but rank it in the 300s?  I think there are lots of games ranked higher than it that are much better quality games.  For me it scratches the same itch as Mmmmm... Brains!, and  actually is a bit less elegant. That game is ranked at around 6400 I think.... I really don't understand how they are so different in ranking. Perhaps being a decent Godzilla theme game makes people rank it better?  Perhaps because it is so much better than Rocketville? I don't know...  I actually ding it a point in my rating because it is so overproduced. I just don't think you are getting a whole lot of game for the $35-40 retail price tag. If the production value wasn't so high I seriously doubt people would play it more than a couple times and forget about it.

It is a $10 dice game in a $40 box.

Great gateway game. the theme is awesome, who doesn't want to be a monster taking over the world? Love the dice chucking in this game, as well as the cross table smack talk. This game is a riot to play. It's a must have. And yes i like it better than New York. It's simpler and true to its core lighter weight nature.

5 / 5 - Outstanding.

This is a good, fun filler game that manages to be impressively thematic with a minimum of rules. Needs a decent number to work properly - 4-5 is ideal I guess. Seems at first like it might be a slow game but as casualties pile up runs faster and even more exciting.

Never fails to delight; easy to teach, fast to play and fun. Excellent filler game which has been a hit every time. Can drag with higher player numbers and barely works with 2.

Just a fun as hell filler game. It was my other favorite play of DaveCon 2012(Cosmic Encounter), but I already own this so I knew it was going to be fun. Not everybody might like it, but odds are most will and certainly somebody will like it a lot. A virtual can't miss game.

More people = more fun. Some say 5-6 players can get a little chaotic but it's about managing the press your luck aspect of the game. I prefer 6 players, but I can understand if people like 4 players as a sweet spot.
 
House ruled Energize. Monsters are just token placeholders, which is getting fixed in the expansion. Promo cards are worth getting.

Updated score from 8 to 9 just for the fun factor. Also, 2-0 against others.

Ratings potential: 8-9. I just don't see it changing. If the expansion was included from the start, this would be bumped by .5 to 1 points. The expansion is so small it adds little but still nice to have if one if willing to add it.

RATING: 9
King of Tokyo is a fun-filled dice rolling romp!  In it players take on the persona of a giant monster, a la Godzilla, and fight each other to dominate Tokyo.  On your turn you roll dice Yahtzee style, whereby you have three rolls to get the symbols you want. You can roll numbers which give you victory points, electric bolts which get you energy, claws which are attacks that you can use against other monsters, or hearts which heal you.  You can use your energy gained through rolls to purchase cards that will give your monster various special abilities.  You win by being the first person to get 20 victory points, or by killing off all your opponents.

The game is beautifully made.  The player markers are cardboard stands with fun cartoony renditions of monsters. The dice are chunky with the custom images engraved into them.  There's even a cool push-your-luck aspect to the game, as the longer a player stays in Tokyo the more victory points you earn.  However, you can't heal your wounds in Tokyo, so the longer you stay the more chance of getting killed.  Everything about the game is great!  Buy a copy now!

So much fun to play with the right crowd. The children loves it.

RATING: 2
Perhaps the most overrated game ever made. 

It's not anything about what kind of game this is - I like short games; I like dice games, and I love the idea of dueling giant monsters.

What I don't like is a game with little strategy, and what strategy there is being completely unthematic. Half the dice are friggin' rolling for victory points for chrissake. Unthematic random VP crap can be bad in a Euro, but in a game like this, it's pretty unforgiveable.

Also, in games I've seen, the winner tends to be the person who spends as little time in Tokyo as possible - those who overstay their welcome get killed, and those who play cowardly and roll for VPs tend to win. And those who go for cool special abilities find that the game usually ends before they can do much with them.

In other hands, it's a luck-filled, non-strategic game that rewards the dullest and most unthematic strategy. 

This game is barely passable as a kid's game - for adults, it's a miserable failure. If you want some mindless violent fun play Cash and Guns instead. Just because a game is designed by Richard Garfield and features giant monsters doesn't mean it's any good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Awesome Yahtzee adaptation. Easy to teach, simple mechanics allow for fun bantering. Getting points directly from dice is bit boring even though there's push-your-luck element involved and player elimination can be a problem (especially if you play with 4+) but other than that it's a nice game. Power Up! is decent expansion.

2-Player Comment:
* I think King of Tokyo is fun even with two, but the more the merrier. Unofficial 2p variant: Only 1 point per round in Tokyo. Lose 1 health per round in Tokyo. Otherwise follow normal rules.

Expansions:

Full Review: http://manualgamer.com/king-of-tokyo-review/

Tokyo smashing goodness!  In King of Tokyo, players get to be giant monsters rampaging through Tokyo, causing as much chaos and mayhem as possible.  It is fast, fun and fantastic for families and casual gamers.

Essentially, it is Yahtzee with giant monsters and super powers.

Fun and light, with different strategies depending on what others are doing, and the cards that are available.  Shall I rush Tokyo and smash down my opponents?  Shall I sit in the background and go for point victory?  Shall I power up my character with various abilities?

King of Tokyo is incredibly easy to learn and teach.  The amount of luck involved means that brand new players have plenty of opportunity to win against seasoned veterans.

Sometimes the interaction between particular power-up cards isn’t clear.  Fortunately this is a rare occurrence, and if players can’t agree then there is a fist full of monster dice to help settle any argument.

Players who have difficulty with being eliminated may need some assistance and coaxing to play (adults or children).  However given the short play time and the amount of luck involved in this game, players shouldn’t take elimination too personally.

While this game does play with 2 players, doing so loses much of the interaction that comes with 3 plus players.

RATING: 7
This game is absolutely a blast, but only with 3 or more people! Yes, the game can be played with only two, but I don't recommend it. Gets boring quickly with less than 3. Otherwise, it is a lot of fun! Fast paced and easy to learn. Fun for all ages!

Good: 
Entertaining selection of characters, power ups, and powers. 

Easy to teach and pretty quick to play, yet has interesting gameplay. Which makes it the perfect candidate for a large variety of gamer and non-gamer types. 

Theme is successfully portrayed in art and gameplay. 

Bad: 
Once you have seen all of the characters in action, powers, and power ups the game loses some of its shine and becomes a bit repetitive. 

The Power Up! expansion is a must if you enjoy this game as it actually gives each character themed powers and increases the diversity of the hearts on the dice.

I love the yahtzee thing going on, I love the theme and the components of the game. I don't really like the 2 player: it's hard to get one out of Tokyo soon enough. Damage doesn't do much unless you throw yahtzee with claws at once...

Edit: played it with 3 (my parents): my mother won and immediately liked the game (simple and fun!). 3 players is better than 2. I think it will be optimal with 4 or more.

Edit2: again played with my parents. They simultaneously asked for another game because the first game was so short... A really good sign! ;)

Edit3: adjusted my rating. My father said he didn't like this game as much as he said before. It feels too simple for him, he likes some challenge (even though he's prone to AP) and to be able to have the feeling of control over certain game-events.

RATING: 8
So fun!  Simple game with limited strategic/tactical options and heavily dice-dependent, but the interaction between players is strong and makes for a great atmosphere.  Players attack each other directly so there's strong conflict but always in a fun manner that gets people laughing, cheering, and sometimes even shouting.

The special ability cards are the source of variability from play to play.  Some cards when bought can really change the strategy for all other players, so each game is unique.  It's a pity that so few cards come into play in any given session because some of them can really swing the balance of a game.

Component quality is excellent and the artwork is just terrific.  The look of the game alone will get a lot of people interested in it.  It's definitely not a dry Euro game in either aesthetics or mechanics.  Fun for all ages.

After a few more plays the rating dropped to 6.5.  As soon as a player got eliminated we didn't want to sit around for the end of the game, so some wandered off the play other games.
I think this game is good for a certain group, unfortunately it somehow didn't click for me.

I was really wanting to play this and I was a bit disappointed. I like dice games and this has some nice cards that power up your monster, it just didn't feel like monsters battling it out. From the reviews, I thought this would be a silly filler for adults, but it fell flat with a group of adults. However, for those that have kids, I could see this being a favorite. The card powers would entertain kids and the components are fun. I just thought it was overproduced zombie dice :(

Edit: Got a chance to play with my M.S. Game Club. The kids loved it and we had a lot of fun!

The core system is a pretty standard press your luck sort of game, with a minor twist. The results of the dice usually have a pretty clear best solution if you have decided which strategy to employ.

I’d been looking for a lighter, silly themed game for a while, and this does a good job.  Basic mechanics are great, and the “king-of-the-hill” style gameplay works wonders for keeping everyone engaged in a game of “direct conflict” while avoiding much of the issues that plague other take-that style games.  That said, I think the game could have used more development and balancing.  We’ve resorted to using a number of house rules to mainly increase the energy supplies enabling more turn-over and use of the power cards, which is the real interesting part of the gameplay.  It is yet another take on the Yahtzee die rolling mechanic, but it’s wrapped into quite an interactive and tense game.

This is a great gateway game; it's easy to teach and seems to be widely appealing due to a great theme and eye-catching art. While it can play a wide range of players, I would say there is a sweet spot with 4 (with more it can drag on due to players auto-fleeing when in Tokyo). 

Expansions:
* The "Power Up!" expansion is a must-have, as it adds a nice catch-up mechanic through the evolution cards (with the added thematic bonus).
* The "Halloween" expansion adds some cool new monsters with the interesting "Gift" Evolutions, but can probably wait to be purchased until you really need another fix for your board game buying addiction.

Delightfully simple and well thought out.  I really like this game.   However, I do wish there were more 'differences' between the kaiju.  The cardboard cut-outs are really just for theme and serve no actual purpose in the game.  For all intents and purposes, players could use the sample pictures that come with a new wallet and it would not effect the game play.  Perhaps that will change with the expansions.

11/15/11 Played a five-player game. I knew I would hate it before the box was opened. And my opinion didn't change. I have *zero* interest in silly games with monsters. I'd rather watch paint dry. The only reason I didn't rate it a "1" was I only had to endure seven minutes of it, as I engineered my own elimination on my second turn. My main regret was I couldn't do that on my first turn. Oh, and what's the deal with a deck of 52 or so cards? In our game I think no more than 4 were turned over. I hope to never see this dreck again.

Fast filler (no game lasted longer than 30 (edit: 35) minutes yet). Everyone I played with did really dig it and wanted at least one further play. Luck plays a lesser role than evident at first glance, though some cards may be seen as too strong in certain game situations. People telling that the game never sees monsters trying to win by victory points may either prefer pure combat or simply ignore some possibilities of the game - to put it politely.

A favorite of everyone that I've gotten to play it! A Kaiju (giant monster) themed game, with simple, yet fun game mechanics. Personally, I prefer the first edition art over the second, as well as the monsters themselves. Overall, this game is a very fun game that most will enjoy!

As with any dice game, there's definitely a randomness to KoT.  However, I think it works well with the fast and chaotic theme.  This isn't a strong strategy game, per se, although there certainly is some decision making.  I tend to really enjoy it because of the fun theme and great art, fairly fast play, and the fact that it plays up to 6 players.  If you like games like Martian Dice or Zombie Dice, I look at this as a much better multi-player implementation of something like that.  You're still just rolling dice and hoping, but there's enough strategy mixed in to keep it engaging.  I do have a hard time with the player-elimination aspect, but it's usually a short enough game that this isn't a notable problem.  Unfortunately, most of the gamers I've played with don't seem to enjoy it as much as me, but as a family game or just something to bring out with a group of casual friends, it seems to go over very well.

A light-hearted fun game, shines when played by the "rule of cool" instead of doing your outmost to coldly play the odds. Sure - you can just die (and thus be eliminated) by what is a fluke of the dice, but I find I don't care.

Ultimately, I don't get much satisfaction out of playing, I think I'm irked about the numbers, they feel a bit cheap, if the dice had 6 difference faces, or just duplicates of some, and all of them had some sort of ability - then I'd be more happy. As it is, rolling for numbers reminds me too much of Yahtzee. More energy also to get wacky with the cards a bit more maybe? Bah, anyway, I like the concept, and I could easily be more enthused with it if it only had a biiiiit more meat to it. Maybe New York? Though I fear it adds complexity to all the wrong areas.

A perfectly fine game, it's just that I'd always pick something else I guess

Game in a Nutshell: Roll dice to gain 20 VP or be the last monster standing.

Played as: 4,5,6 player

Pros: Great theme, excellent art, and big chunky components. Easy to explain and enjoy to its fullest on the first play. Tons of power-ups such that you could play several plays without seeing them all let alone actually buying or using them. Playable with a broad range of ages.

Cons: Perhaps it's the quick playtime or maybe the overall luckiness, but I never seem to care about how I'm doing such that there's more than a little excitement or tension. Really, that's a pretty significant ding given there's not a ton or cognitive interest or crunchy decisions to be made. Player elimination, however short lived, never feels really great.

Other: This game was on the top of my wishlist for over a year and one I really wanted to like. It's a fine, fun game but it sort of disappointed in that there seems to be more moans than cheers during play. It's something Magical Athlete (another stupid, for-fun dice game), for its lack of variety, had: an attachment to your progress that filled each roll with loads of adrenaline. I was expecting more of that in King of Tokyo.

Best Use: Good for starting or ending a game night.

After ~40 plays. Quintessential beer and pretzels game for us. It works on almost everyone. Whenever we have nongamers over (most of our friends are nongamers), we play this and it always, always does the trick. I'm also weirdly good at it. I've won a lot more than I should. Strange given how chancy it is. 

[update] My winning ways with KoT continues. I entered a tournament with more than 100 players at the World Boardgaming Championships 2017 and won the whole thing. I shouldn't be winning as much as I am, but there you have it

This one has fallen of the map a bit recently. It was my go-to pull off the shelf for months after owning it. One of the reasons could be that I find the game too structured. What I mean is that it follows a very distinct pattern based on the number of players. For example, in a two player game, cards are generally ignored and occupying Tokyo is the fastest way to win. With three players, a late push into Tokyo after rolling some VPs will probably get you the win. I don’t think cards are viable until playing with five or more players. Also, an underlying mechanism that develops is that players tend to mirror each other. If a player rolls VPs the next player will inevitably try the same. Then the third player feels like they’re falling behind and they feel compelled to follow suit. Same can be said if players start stockpiling energy. I’ll admit not all games follow this formula but no matter the group, the “sheep” mentality prevails. Is this bad? No. For me it slightly detracts from the game. The only other negative about the gameplay is that I find 20 VPs to be too short. With the addition of five or ten more points I think it would make a world of difference. It would give time for players to upgrade their monsters with purchased cards while not feeling they’d fall behind players that were focused on rolling VPs versus energy. One fix to the issues could be to use the evolution cards. I’ve been hesitant to pull them out because I imagine them making the game shorter. Hopefully I’m wrong but I’ve yet to try them.

On a separate note, I REALLY like Broken Token’s organizer for this game. Using the organizer I am able to fit so much into the base game’s box. In addition to all the components in the base game, I’ve added the 1st Power Up expansion, the Halloween expansion, and all the components from the 2nd Ed. Base game except for the board. I didn’t see a need to have a second in the box. That’s a total of 16 Monsters (additional monster being a promo – Kookie) with their associated boards and stands, 2 sets of power tokens, 2 decks of double sleeved power cards and costume cards, sleeved evolution cards, 3 sets of dice, a bunch of energy cubes, game board and rules.
 
The component quality is excellent. One exception is the painted dice. Seeing as how I have backups, I’m not too concerned. The Monsters, cards, artwork and other components are great and outshine the faulty dice.

Very impressed with this one. Incredibly simple, I can't imagine it would ever take more than five minutes to explain this, and you could probably explain the game in sixty seconds.

HOW CAN THIS BE DISLIKED BY ANYONE.

This is a lot of fun for a short game. There are enough strategic options to make it interesting, and the high amount of player conflict makes the game very engaging. They've very successfully hit the theme here, and I don't imagine my rating changing for a long time. Nov 2013 Updated (from 8): It's still fun, but I'm a bit overdone on it. The game is pretty light, and people want to play it as something other than filler.

Excellent filler game.  Games last 15-30 minutes.  The decisions are interesting, the interaction is high, and the art is really fun.

Dec 2013: Bumping down from 8.5 to 7.5. Sadly, the winning strategy seems to be "stay out of Tokyo and don't die." Very rarely in my experience does a game end by someone reaching 20 stars.  So the multiple paths to victory aren't as balanced as I had hoped, and therefore many of the bonuses on cards just aren't worth going after.  Still, it's fun, quick, and the art is great.

It's a mediocre dice roller with a great theme that feels like a missed opportunity. It's about giant Godzilla monsters for crying out loud! Yet the game is more about rolling dice than smashing stuff. There is no God.

Another great game from Richard Garfield. Probably best with 4, but I wouldn't hestitate to play it with 3 or 6. 

It's really fast and because of that the lucky nature doesn't bother me at all (unlike other more time demanding games). And while luck plays a large roll in how well you do, the fact that you get those 2 rerolls plus the power cards you might get to purchase, plus the possible "negotiation" (more like pleading, usually XD) adds to you actually having some saying on your destiny...

It's cheap (or cheapish), has great quality overall and it's easy to teach, accesible for beginers and enjoyable for experienced gamers.

I don't care for dice games much, but this is a decent one for the family.  The main problem I have with it is that it has has this wonderful deck of cards with powers and abilities and it almost never matters.  By the time you get enough energy to buy one bodies are already hitting the ground due to the guy who rolled five smashes.

Pretty fun game, but the idea of the characters seems kind of pointless as they don't really influence the game play at all. It's pretty straightforward and with little strategy, but still fun among friends.

RATING: 7.5
Fun, thematic, and amusing.  I'm not entirely sure that I like it with more than four players though.  The fact that people get bounced out and then can't do anything is kind of a mixed bag.  Fortunately, games are pretty quick.

It's a very good light filler. The artwork is great and the theme is awesome. The game is easy enough to teach to anyone. I'd probably rate it higher if I had kids to play with because for me that's the type of game it is.

I played yahtzee all the time as a kid, so I really like Kong of Tokyo. I like the push-your-luck element of trying to stay as long in Tokyo as possible. Mostly not a winning strategy, but very fun for me. One of the best fillers in my opinion.

Oh, the lovely sound of dice-rolling...makes my head spin and wanting to puke. King of Tokyo is without strategy, thinking or planning. It is dice-rolling all the way through to the city sewers. Your game is totally dependent on what your dice gives you and not even the varied cards and wellcrafted art saves this from being an absolutely boring feast of dice-eating boredom. 

Oh, did I mention that if you die you are out? Good luck waiting 20-30 minutes while waiting for your friends to end the game. But then again, you can enjoy the pleasurable pain of the sound of dice-rolling for half-an hour uninterrupted.

So if this is just Godzilla Yahtzee, why do I rate it so much higher than Elder Sign? Well, for one, it's fun- a good deal more so than its Cthulhu cousin. It plays so fast that it usually sees 2-3 rounds each time, it looks great (cartoony monsters and chunky dice), and is far more family friendly than Elder. Unfortunately, it still feels a bit too slight for most of my groups. If they liked it better, I bet this would be an 7.5 or so for me.

One of the best intro games for the truly game-illiterate. A lot of fun, a bucket of theme without-technically-breaking-copyright laws, and easily taught and played quickly enough to get more than one game in.

Not something I pick up by choice, but never a burden to teach and play.

RATING: 7
The art is nice, and the theme is pretty strong. Players can be eliminated early on, which leads me to give it a lower rating.

As with any game that involves dice, there is an element of chance and luck. This aspect affects the strategic part of the game, but it also makes for a much more exciting game as well.

Recommended!

RATING: 8
Solid, fun game that I enjoy playing with my family.  My kids 6 & 9 years old, enjoy it and can play along with my wife and I.  They even win sometimes.  Although a more mature strategy almost always wins, since there is dice rolling involved, sometimes the kids can luck into some success thanks to all that variance.

I've had good success with this one playing with more casual gaming types, so I'd say it's generally a pretty good crowd pleaser.  A little one dimensional for my tastes, but still a very fun game.

A blast to play with a big group. The dice rolling mechanic leaves a lot to chance but creates a nice element of suspense on every turn. The goofy theme and artwork really makes the game feel more fun and relaxed. Game length is relatively short and allows for multiple games to be played in one session. All-in-all it is a great game.

RATING: 8
King of Tokyo is super fun, pretty light, but actually a little more strategic than it seems. The game is addictive in a way most board games aren't. As soon as one game ends, people want to play another game. I think this is because the cards and dice together add enough randomness that there's the feeling that you always COULD have won if things had just gone your way a little more.

I lump this into "reactionary strategy," which are games like poker, in which you have to be smart given a randomized set of ever-changing circumstances, as opposed to planning strategy, which are games like chess (or Agricola, etc) in which you have to smartly manipulate a complex system to give you an ideal outcome.

Because it's random, I feel like King of Tokyo gets crap from people for not being strategic, but there is real strategy in playing the dice you roll, not trying to brute force your way to one result.

Fantastic game.

Very fun dice rolling game that plays quickly.  Think of Yahtzee with kaiju combat and minor character progression.  A very nice game to get people into more complex gaming as dice rolling is fun, it's colorful and does not outstay it's welcome.  More experienced gamers might find the randomness bothersome and character elimination is a little odd in modern gaming, but the game is fun and fast so these issues are minimized.

First game was not that interesting really. However it seems to get better with more plays as you start to see the value of the cards. The first game we didn't make the most of the cards but the second game we used them a lot more and enjoyed it more too. This game brings out some awful character acting from all my family who decide to be their characters. Though I'd prefer to play Meka Dragon my daughter finds it amusing to have me play as Cyber Bunny.

Great game, great party game, great gateway game. No one, and I mean no one, I have ever played this hasn't felt the love for this game. I had zero interest in this because it seemed to basic, a reversion-ed Yahtzee. It isn't, it's great, even if you think its not your thing, get it for when boring relatives come into town. The one bad thing? After the first play you will figure out how great this game is and know you will want to keep it for a while. That means sleeving the cards. Game box has a great insert, love the insert, really wish more games came with a good insert. But the insert wont work if you sleeve the cards. At some point international law should intervene and if you make a game, with a really good insert, that doesn't hold sleeved cards, you should be shot.

Pretty great filler. It is simple to explain, turns are quick and it plays in about 30 minutes or so. It's a game where I get to chuck handfuls of dice and be a monster, beating up the other monsters. Which is to say that it's pretty far from my usual fare. Nice change of pace.

Looks amazing! The tiny little board is cute, the art is pretty awesome, and a bunch of huge dice in your hand feels lovely. Yahtzee fighting rules are super streamlined so there's no AP. Turns are quick but involved. Lots of power up cards add a little more theme, richness, and variety to the game. The only negative point is player elimination, but the game is quick enough for it not to be too annoying.

Original score was a '7'.  Played a variant where you take two energy cubes every time you roll the dice, and it definitely improved the enjoyment of the game.  When you only get one energy cube it just felt that it was not worth keeping the energy cube die rolls.  This variant upped the game's score to an '8'.    

Would trade this game away as I already have enough filler games, but realize one day my kids will want to play a game.  Then I will remember that I traded this away, and now I am stuck with Monopoly or Candy Land.

Great, simple filler game of screwage!  Each player is a monster attacking Tokyo - because that is what monsters do - and if you are in Tokyo, you are dealing damage to everyone outside.  However, if you are outside he city everyone is attacking the (up to two) monsters inside the city.  Lots of trash talk, great for kids, and a lot of fun!

Yeah, dude, I'm just not into player elimination.

Qwirkle Cubes does the whole "make the best of a bunch of chucked dice" more elegantly, in less time, and without player elimination...and I'm not even really that into that game.

Another recent dice game that should not be taken too seriously! An enjoyable dice game that plays rather quickly. Everyone who got introduced to this game by us, was enthusiastic. OK, there is not a lot of strategy involved and you need some luck with the dice but with a lot of guts you can get far in this game! Push your luck too much and you're almost instantly killed in Tokyo and can be thrown out of the game. But since it plays in under 30 minutes, you can take revenge in another draw and that's what makes this game a new classic. My oldest son likes to play this adult game already and even wins most of the times!

King of Tokyo ist eines dieser Spiele, die kann man am immer mal wieder auf den Tisch bringen und es macht jedes Mal Spaß. Egal ob absolute Brettspielneulinge, oder Profis.
Die Regeln sind super einfach und der Einstieg kinderleicht, denn im Prinzip steckt in King of Tokyo eine aufgebohrte "Kniffel"-Mechanik. Mit den Würfeln kann man entweder Angreifen, sich Heilen, Energie sammel um Karten zu kaufen, oder Siegpunkte erlangen. Dabei wollen alle Spieler die Herrschaft über Tokyo. Hatte ich erwähnt, dass die Spieler riesige Monster sind? Saucool oder?!

RATING: 7
It's little more then Yhatzee with extras when the theme's stripped off, but its the theme that catches my eye rather then just scanning past and thinking "meh, dice game". Its easy to learn and not taxing on white cells to play, making it an excellent family/gateway game into more interesting themes.

It IS a dice game and therefore its just a big luck fest from start to finish, but the option to pick upgrade cards and juggling gaining life, VPs and taking life from opponents gives enough game play to keep me entertained for 25 minutes.

Watch out though as this game is prone to all the usual competitive negatives including player elimination, king making and runaway leader, and it is possible in a 5-6 player game for both occupants of Tokyo to kill every player outside in 2 sets of rolls...

This aside it can be really good fun if you don't take it too seriously. Exceedingly popular with more casual gamers.

Hilarious fact: We actually received a noise complaint from our neighbours in January 2014. Why? Because we were playing King of Tokyo at 12.30am and I assume we were enjoying it too much. Is it possible to get an ASBO for board gaming?

Components were cool and I liked the theme. However, the overall gameplay feels too luck based and player elimination added on top of that is just too much for me. In our games the player who kept just rolling for points won the most of the time which questiones the point of going to Tokyo.

This game really delivers as advertised.  It plays well with all levels of players.  While certainly light, there is a significant amount of player interaction.  A fair percentage of games we've played have come down to a critical attribute of a card or stand up die roll.  I'm very glad to have this in my collection.

Video Review: https://youtu.be/lostKL-JOXA

I love this game. I am slightly biased as it was my gateway game to the board game hobby, but still. The appeal for me was in the huge battling monsters and the yahtzee style dice rolls, then I saw the green energy cubes and it was game over. Simply an excellent game.

This is a light filler dice game at its best. The theme of mega monsters going at it is cool, the dice mechanics are more subtle than they first appear and the player interaction is strong whilst the downtime is minimal.

RATING: 7
Fun, light-hearted and easy on the rules and game mechanics. However, do yourself a favor and put a focus on buying Power cards. These are what gives the game some flavor. The rules don't force you to focus on getting energy and buying powers. New players won't see the incentive in doing so. It is possible to finish the entire game without buying a power. And that was the most boring game I have ever played. Buy Powers. As many as you can. Even if that means delaying the end of the game unnecessarily. Have everyone else also invest into powers. Do that and the game is fun.

RATING: 9
This is currently the mostly played game in my family, and my 7 years old twins are crazy for it. 

It is a dice game that hits the sweet spot with its Yahtzee style rolls, multiple paths to victory element, king of the hill battle mechanics, all within a gorgeous and highly attractive Godzila monster invades Tokyo theme. 

Cards add a lot of flavor and game mechanics, and since only a small subset is used for each match, the game maintains its novelty and freshness for a long time. 

Richard Garfield has done it again and this game deserves the success it got in the last couple of years. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a fun game, but I still don't get all that fuzz, it's not THAT good. Usually it's over too quickly & you get too few energy cubes per game to buy cards and make it something else than pure dice rolling. With 2-3 players it is somewhat boring and with 5-6 players you can get killed instantly. Still, the sweet spot seems to be with 4-5 players.  

Maybe you could tweek the rules or maybe the expansion would remove some of the problems, but is it really worth the money? 25 euros for a filler expansion? I bought the base game from sales so i got it at -30% price, which seems more like the ACTUAL value.

Oh, what a kitschy subtle game. The first time I didn't like it. The second time it was ok. The third time I began enjoying it. By now I am hooked. 

This is an excellent example of the "hey let's get together and have a good time" game. This is one of those games that lets you actually have a good time with people, not just with the game itself. 

That's because the game itself is average. But the components, the theme, the special powers, and the overall "aura" it possesses make for a true gem. 

Some of my friends do not like it, and I really think that this is a pity. I always want to play this, because I always want to simply have fun with my friends.

2-6 players, although I probably wouldn't play with 2.  30 minutes, maybe 40 with a larger group.  A fun and hilarious game about monsters destroying Tokyo and beating each other up. This game rates an 8 with my own deck of cards that make it King of Winnipeg. Otherwise, I'd maybe rate KoT a 7. The fact that the cards are junky limits what strategies are viable and make the game more luck dependent.

A game you play once and never stop playing, simple mechanics and very fun to play, King Of Tokyo combines the luck of the dice with a small strategic angle in order for you to win.
An excellent game for beginners in the boardgame world, King Of Tokyo is very easy to understand and start playing, even if you have never tried something of the genre before you will get the hang in no time, with the twist of the cards and the energy cubes for you to buy more powers, it's always fun to play and it's a quick game so you don't take to long completing one playthrough which makes it a blast to play.

I have a blast with King of Tokyo every single time I play it.  The artwork in the game is awesome, it plays quickly, and I've never once felt bored.  Great game.  The only knock against it is that it has player elimination, although the game usually doesn't last much longer once monsters start dying off.

I highly recommend playing with the variant found here:

I also own the Power Up and Halloween expansions.

EDIT: Definitely fired from my collection by King of New York.  I like that KoNY gives the players more to do if they aren't in the main point-getting parts of the city (Tokyo/Manhattan).  I'll of course keep KoT, so I can keep playing as Cyber Bunny!

After playing this game with various player counts, I have to say....meh...I have rated it a 6 only because everyone else in the world seems to love it so much and I still think I am missing something. The luck so outweighs any strategy that I do not find it enjoyable. You can mitigate your risk all you want, but in one lucky role get put out of the game. Just not fun!

18/6/15 - Played and lost 3 games, but had a great time with a friend. Perhaps there is something to this game?

---------------------

Ultimately this game did not engage me like it does others. I never really had 'fun' playing it. There is definitely and good way to play and a bad way to play, so it is not all luck based, but it just felt so samey every game. I found I really had to engineer a lot of the wow factor with smack talk and that only goes well in certain crowds.

I love this monster- yahtzee game! It is a perfect mix of luck and strategy. It has dice, cards, "money", health, and victory points.

This game has a great theme that has instant appeal to a large demographic. It capitalizes on that theme by having colorful, evocative artwork and these fun [i][b]super-sized monster standees[/b][/i].

Players are monsters attempting to be the King of Tokyo, either by accumulating 20 VP first or be the last one standing. Players roll dice on their turn to either earn VP, attack, heal or get energy. Energy is used to purchase cards, which may give you more bonuses. The damage you do depends whether you are in Tokyo or outside of Tokyo. Inside, you damage all monsters outside, and when you are outside, you can only damage those monsters inside. 

This game was designed by Richard Garfield, and it is a fun little filler. I'm looking forward to more plays.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
By all rights a dice game with lots of luck using player elimination shouldn't be fun. This one is great. Player elimination is used in just the right way. The dice rolling has enough strategy in it that the luck adds excitement not meaninglessness, the components are fun, appropraite and likable. People have complain that a given game doesn't use very many of the cards available... how is this bad? This means any given game your unlikely to repeat the same cards over and over and there's always plenty of variety. The expansion is strong though it doesn't add much--the expansion should be a better value--but this is often the case with small expansions. This game is one of the few board games that actually plays well as a "party" game of 6 people without resorting to not having a board. For family, for adults having parties, for gatherings, I can't recommend this game highly enough for how strong it is. People have complained that certain strategies just trump others; this is not the case. If you think you can just "roll for numbers" this is easily countered once someone realizes what you're doing. Likewise, just going for kills doesn't always make sense either. There is no "cheat" or "perfect" strategy for this game and you have to adapt. If a strategy seemed perfect its only because your opponents failed to adapt to it. Luck is a factor but don't let dice make you think this has more luck than many euro games that incorporate luck but dont even have dice. Overall, great game. I rate this according to the criteria BGG provides.

This game continues to just be a fairly shallow but incredibly awesome and fun crowd pleaser. An essential game for my collection.

Like this more than I expected to. Good fun, quick.

**House Rule**

1st) Drafting 
We added a drafting phase at the beginning of the game (much like 7 Wonders). Draw 5 cards, keep 1, give the remaining cards to the player on your left. From the 4 cards you received by the player on your right, keep 1. And so on. 

The selected cards are not activated but you can buy them later in the game if you can afford them.

*Also own Powerup expansion, though it slows the game down too much to bother with* 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
A very fun adaptation to the Yahtzee dice rolling mechanic. 

It makes it very approachable to new players who have never played a "board game" before.

It does have a good bit of confrontation and players can get knocked out early, making them sit idly by as they watch others having fun. That is my biggest negative to this game, and it is a considerable downside because it happens often, although the games are short so it isn't a huge deal.

As a "king of the hill" style game, it's a matter of course that it works better with multiple players.  Perhaps there should be some kind of "duel" variant for when there are only two players.  Great artwork and straightforward theme, although the dice rolling mechanic strikes me as slightly inelegant.

Rating based on 1 play during CanCon 2015 (Canberra Australia)

I can see how appealing this game can be, especially to a general audience. Has a nice mix of luck, actions and simple play mechanics. However it is mostly just a an exercise in push your luck. Continual rolling of dice and not getting what you are after can get repetitive and boring. This is not the game for me but can see more potential with the right group of people aiming to have some social fun. Would recommend to non-gamers and younger age groups (greater appeal to younger ages although can be enjoyed by all ages).

Played this a couple of times over the past summer at a meetup and liked it enough to buy it...my friends at school didn't like it as much.

I liked this game's Yahtzee like mechanic and its theme of monsters and effects.

I dislike Wings, Jets, and the sometimes freak rolls which swung the game wildly. I also realized that I hate the player elimination (thought I was okay with this, but 10 minutes is too long for a player to be out, and player elimination is only okay if there's other games going on/people need to leave/do stuff). I think Player Elimination is okay in extremely short sub-10-minutes games but not even okay for 15 minutes in my opinion.

That said, its still a lot of fun with the right crowd who takes it for what it is: a dice chucking party-esque game. There was a neat variant on the forums too of giving every player a starting random item and extra energy to compensate the ones who got bad items. I think that's probably worth a try too.

Overall nice idea for a game, but player elimination and heavy party nature hurts it a bit.

This is a great game to finish a night of board gaming. I am not a fan of player elimination but this game is goofy and quick enough that I don't mind it and fits perfectly for the end of a night. I particularly enjoy the light and goofy theme. The rules are easy to explain. This game is best played with a loud group who enjoys taunting and trash talking.

I would recommend this game to anybody who enjoys light party games and does not mind player elimination. Avoid this game if you do not like conflict.

Simply put: a great game!

The artwork is evocative and fun. The dice are easy to read. The cards are effective, colourful and simple to understand. And the player interaction is very high.

Don't let the theme or style of this game keep you away, like it did me. Once we cracked it open and gave it a few plays we all loved it.

Two negatives in my book however:
1. The dice are way larger than they need to be. Younger kids may have trouble picking up and rolling.
2. The components are not super robust. You'll need to be a little careful with the monster boards.

It's a fun game to play with my kids, but I guess it doesn't grab me quite as much as others.  I like that you really don't pick the person to attack, so it doesn't end up being a "gang up on one player" kind of game.  The dice are nice and the cards are fun.  For me, it just feels like there is something missing - maybe more choices or strategy?  If you're in the mood to just roll some dice, it's a solid game.

Very easy to learn and a LOT of fun.  I think it's the best "ease of learning to fun ratio" game I've played.  

If you have 5 or 6 players it comes down to killing not Victory points.  I like the smaller player options where you are more likely to win by Victory points and have more time to buy cards.  I like to play, but not all the time.

Too light for me.  It's a shame, because I thought it would be far more fun than it is, since it's mostly rolling dice and not necessarily pairing that with the acquisition of cool cards.  Hell, most games ended without the help of any cards.

Now, I'm thinking of getting the gamier King of New York, but my girlfriend did like this one as it is. 

Update:  With TheDacker's Double Dose of Energy Variant it played more fun with 4 players as more cards got to come out.

Great theme, excellent blend of dice rolling, card bidding, tactics, and ability scaling. Luck and strategy are very even, but there are clearly not a whole lot of diverse paths to victory. The most disconnected element in the game is rolling for victory points.

RATING: 6.4
Nice stupid party game, but the elimination system can make the game a painfully boring experience for a player who has just been wiped out early. The power cards are extremely unbalanced with regards to the number of players and should be manually adjusted. For instance, the "Wings" are OP for a 2-player game and next to useless with 6 players.

Kaiju Yahtzee. King of Tokyo somehow manages to still be fun despite the fact that each turn feels like 3 pulls on a giant-monster themed slot machine. The artwork, theme, components, and player interactivity are enough to elevate what is essentially a mindlessly simple game.

I was so very excited for this game, and when it came I must have played it 8 times in a row with my girlfriend who loved it. I really enjoy this as a two player game. It's quick and fun with enough depth that you don't grow weary of it. The cards can make some truly awesome combinations and just up the strategy enough to make me WANT to play my next turn.

Still, it's not all sunshine for me. I have really had trouble playing with more than two players. The game just feels so slow compared to the blistering pace you can set with two people. It's more chaotic and unpredictable which is a good thing for this game, but at the moment, 4 players adds too much time for me to get excited for a game. 3 people was a decent mix but still not the same feeling I got with just 2.

This is a great game.  Simple, easy, but very fun and if the right cards come out, can have some really creative strategy.  

I also find that the game can feel very different based on the type of players.  Aggressive players will go for claws while conservative players might focus on maintaining their health.  Different styles gives the game a very different feel.

It's also my go-to game for non-gamers or people who typically prefer mass market family games.

King of Tokyo is a nice mix of mechanics and a strong theme based on Kojiro films better known as Godzilla.  It's extremely easy to learn and has a common side effect of: new players seem to win more often than not.

I own this game and out of countless play throughs I have only won once, but always come back for more.  My little brothers (ages 14 and 16) as well as my mother play this game with no issue and they absolutely love it.

GAMEPLAY: The game revolves around 6 dice, a simple playmat called Tokyo, and the player's avatar/player-cards.  The 6 dice have 6 unique sides (1, 2, 3, energy, fight, and heal).  The Tokyo playmat shows whose in Tokyo.  And the Avatar is the fun aesthetic representing who is who, the play-card tracks Victory Points and your avatar's Health.  The game is divided into each player taking turns, one after the other.

When it's your turn you roll the 6 dice, choose to keep any or none and reroll.  This process is repeated till there has been a total of 3 rolls or all dice are kept.  If you get to the third roll then you must keep all dice.

Energy is spent on buying cards revealed and each card has some sort of benefit to yourself and often hinders other players.

King of Tokyo is fun, and the kids love it, but for me it's on the edge of being too complicated for a dice game. I do kind of dig the king-of-the-hill feeling the damage mechanism employs. It only works well with larger numbers though, and then you end up with greater downtime. Downtime in dice games kinda sucks. The game would probably be better if you just got one roll and that was it. On the other hand, it is lavishly over-produced for what it is!

A great, light, easy and fun filler that I really like to play in "bigger" groups. 2 people is fine, but not optimal (we made a house rule for 2 players that works quiet nicely without changing much: entering Tokyo does not give a point and being there on your turn does only give 1 but not two. This nicely balances that Tokyo is not that dangerous)
As it's easy to explain also to new people, it's just one of the most fun fillers for us. So for what it should be, it's really a great one.

Toys. Fantastic bits, cool new dice... it's a simple game, but looks so good I almost bought a copy. The players control giant monsters that battle to live in Tokyo. Roll dice, score hits on one another, heal, gain special powers, and/or score points. King of Tokyo takes about five minutes per player, and would be perfect for teenagers. It was very good for our group of tired thirty- and forty-somethings.

Players roll their dice, then can elect to re-roll some or all of them twice. After three rolls they must accept what they have. This removes the all-or-nothing aspect of many similar games, and adds a little strategy (i.e. do I try to collect points this turn, or attack the other players? Silly question: kill, kill, kill!). You win by reaching 20 points, or being the last one standing.

The theme is great- wiping-out Aneirin's hitpoints is more interesting than stealing a high value worm from her. KoT is more fun than Can't Stop, but really only a step removed. Zombie Dice and Martian Dice are not as cool, but they take up less space.

Just a fun dicethrowing game. Easy concept, gorgeous pieces and tons of fun. Has worked great for 3-6 players for me, but given the chance the more the merrier. More chance for some Tokyo smack-down.

RATING: 7.4
A fun game, (usually) quick game. An entire game built around a king-of-the-hill mechanic that's simple enough to teach quickly. It plays fast, assuming the people you're playing with don't waste too much time thinking about a game that shouldn't really require a ton of strategy.

Meh.  Is really just a filler.  Not much to it.  Plays quick with almost no set up or break down time.  (Which is great for a filler).

King Of Tokyo est un jeu familial +. J'aurai tendance même à dire familial tout court, ça reste un peu entre 2.
Il est très largement accessible de par ses règles simples et claires. Le fun est de la partie.
Malgré son format, je trouve que c'est un bon filler dans le sens où il est toujours bien de se faire une partie plus fun où on va se taper dessus, se venger, après un jeu plus sérieux.
Le jeu est vraiment différent à partir de 5 joueurs où on utilise la 2ième partie du plateau. C'est beaucoup plus fun dans cette configuration.
King Of Tokyo est un nouveau classique incontournable accessible à tous.

Played with 4 players - a little boy taught us 3 girls. it wasn't that fun because we are terrible at dice games. Also, we didn't really fight to try to hurt each other. I would like to try it again with other players but for now, it's not one of the type of games I like to play.

RATING: 10
This game probably hits the table more often than any game I own. A quick, rough, and surprisingly elegant dice throwdown. The rules are very simple, (think Yahtzee, but with Godzilla) but manages to never feel facile. The ability to buy powers adds a layer of depth and personality that many dice-fest games just can't equal. There is certainly a random element to the game, but it always feels like a controlled random, if that makes any sense at all. This one is a personal favorite, and very popular amongst board gamers and non-gamer alike.

[b]King of Tokyo[/b] was sold via auction 6/15/15

[i]Quick update:

After a few years of owning this and many plays it has left our collection. We've grown to like other dice fillers more (games like Qwixx and Qwinto).

- Great, thematic art and some of the most amazing dice we have.
- This game is just fun, you can't help but smile and laugh when you play this. 
- Great gateway game that we have had great success introducing other families to. 
- Might be the easiest game to teach that I own... Roll claws!
- The cards add some fun twists to the game and are worth collecting energy for. That said, I only roll for claws and very rarely leave Tokyo.[/i]

[i]Favorite KoT moment: winning the [thing=144606][/thing] at a Tabletop Day event at the Adams Memorial Library for my daughter. She was so excited and this will be a cool keepsake reminding her of our day spent gaming together![/i]

It has taken many many games for me to cool on King of Tokyo. I still enjoy it, although I won't aggressively push it to the table anymore (mostly because I've played it so much).

The base mechanics are simple but fun. Rolling huge dice is fun. But the magic is all in the cards, which add a lot of variety and spice to every game.

Played 2 games with 6 year old today. Came across a few issues regarding whether a monster can leave Tokyo of his own free will. He was adamant in healing himself even though he had a substantial amount of life left and so I let him do so even though I didn't need to attack him. He still doesn't understand the concept of the monster outside of Tokyo having to focus on damaging the one inside to minimize the decision to stay on for free victory points. I still see the beauty in the game though in the dual ways to win depending on the roll of the die, where your monster is relative to the other and the cards displayed. 

Freaking fun! Player elimination not a major issue here due to the speed at which it plays. And the cards add so much variation to the game too!

Excellent game for 2 to 6 players. It has great replay ability. For example, we have played a few 6 player games and only went through about 10 cards of the deck...there are way more cards that are as of yet untapped. This game is almost a party game in the sense that new gamers can sit down and take it all in as they play. And the game length keeps them involved but ends soon enough for them not to get too board. 

Excellent theme, components and rulebook. One of the best mechanics of the game is when everyone not in Tokyo can hit the monster in Tokyo, and of course, the Monster(s) in Tokyo hit everyone outside of Tokyo. This really keeps the game active and moving. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I give this a nice solid 7, but that's extrapolating a bit from a single 2-player game with my wife.

I got to Tokyo first and was easily able to ride my way to 20 points.  Nobody had the time to buy a card or do any real damage.

This wouldn't have happened with more players out to get me.

Lots of fun with a beautiful theme which helps bring what's really nothing but a dice game to life. A turn is simply rolling 6 dice with 2 re-rolls. Dice can give you VP's (if you get a set of 1's, 2's or 3's), can inflict damage on players not in your location (you're either in Tokyo trying to earn points if you can hang in there until the start of your next turn, or your outside Tokyo whaling on those in Tokyo trying to earn points), heal thyself, or earn cubey things, enough of which will allow you a genetic modification which will enhance your status or capabilities (there's cards in the display). So, go for what you want, re-roll away, whale away, heal thyself, buy good stuff, earn VPs. Die last or get to 20VPs first. Turns are fast. It's a fun decision whether to keep or re-roll damage if it's going in on Tokyo as it's a double-edged sword - they're allowed to move out if they get damage and that forces you in ... at least until you cop it next and you'll be faced with the decision on should you stay or should go ('cause if you go there will be trouble, but if you stay it will be double). So the game is one of trying to stay alive, be on the righteous side of where the damage is going as much as possible and accumulate those VPs as you go. Easy to learn, easy to play, easy to laugh, great components. Good result.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A quick, solid game that's easy to learn and provides some variety.  You assume the role of a giant monster and start smashing (rolling dice).  The dice pretty much determine what you do so you won't like the game if you're not into random dice effects.  The different power-ups provide enough variety so things don't get repetitive.  If I were going to get kids into the gaming hobby, I would start with this game.

RATING: 8.5
Ultra fun game, not to be taken too seriously, works better with a little banter and monster talk. I really love the fact you can go the victory points or last man standing to be crowned King of Tokyo. The cards are cool, I love the variety and the artwork. Just really a neat all round game that plays fast, furious & fun!

KING FUN!! This is the KING of all of the yahtzee-reroll-mechanic dice games out there. Lots of luck in this cool fun dice game about giant monsters playing KING of the Hill in Tokyo.  Try to find the strategy and tactics to win, only to be smacked down by a giant cyber bunny. Kids love this. Best with 3 or more players, though some fun 2 player variants are very good. I'm really liKING this, when initially I expected to think it would be a mediocre game just for kids.

Family Game. Church group game. Beer-and-Pretzels Game. Casual Game.

Fast enough for my ten-year-old, so kid approved!  He enjoyed making a claw-heart-lightning-1-2-3 combo for 9 VP and then going on to win by a nose!  Sadly, too much die rolling to get to the table again....  Math traded.

RATING: 4
"Way too long for what it is (my shortest games have been 35 minutes), especially with player elimination. It's not as easy to learn as some people think (thanks to the sometimes-tricky cards). I don't like attack-y games anyway, but at 15 minutes this might get a 5 or 6 rating from me."

What I liked:
- Cool dice and energy cubes.
- Despite the randomness, there are some decisions to make, both tactical and strategic.

What I didn't like:
- At 35-60 minutes, it is TOO LONG! 15-20 minutes would be much better.
- Player elimination. I have seen multiple players get eliminated 15 minutes in to a 60 minute game.
- The whole game is about attacking each other.
- Being forced into Tokyo when you didn't want to go.
- Complicated special abilities prevent it from being a great gateway game.

More than half the times I have played or watched, the game has dragged out to 45-60 minutes. That's just way too long, especially with player elimination. 

I think the weight is about 2.0, not the 1.5 currently voted by BGG members.

Very fun little game. Fast and ferocious dice-fun! A great filler with good components! Hope to play this many more times. I dislike it with 6 players. Drags on too much. 4 players is best.

This game needs the first expansion.

I might actually for the first time ever go for a house-rule to have players draft some start-up powers just to make it a but more fun...

Thoughts for initial drafting. Players obtain 5 cards each and draft up to a total value of 10 energy. Players may chose Keepers as well as instant cards that are played before game starts. This might give some players a heads start in VP and powers, etc. must try

Love it. Straitforward even for non gamers. Fun dice rolling action, enough decision making, stylish (the small board of the game is an excellent idea).

Its great power is its simplicity and fast gameplay.

Be warned though. In my opinion King of Tokyo is useless as a 2 player game. It doesn’t let you breath. In a situation of 2 players I use two  monsters for each player and forbid monsters of the same player to switch places in and out of Tokyo. 

I think I prefer playing with 4 players.

(Wife's Point of View: She hates strategy and complicated games. That said, she always likes King of Tokyo. Unfortunatelly as a 2 players game it's awful)

My first play was with only three players and I would not recommend it at that number of players. My second was with four players and recently played at six and it is much more interesting as trying to remain in Tokyo is much tougher, since the player in Tokyo (a source of points) gets attacked a lot between turns and the player in Tokyo rotates more. At three I found that although fun at first (more funny then fun) it got old fast. At four or more and with players who are not too fixed on strategy, it is fun and fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
What a boring game. Players take on the roll of monsters and use dice to attack other monsters, heal, and buy cards that have a wide variety of effects. The problem is that that the game is terrible with 2 players but then with 4 or more the game can easily drag way longer than it should and downtime between turns becomes intolerable for a game of this weight. On top of all this, many of the cards are too weird and convoluted for their own good. Gamers can figure them out, but if you are playing with family or casual folk, you are going to get a lot of blank stares when you read the cards to them. So if you have to stop and attempt to explain every other card multiple times until everyone gets it, the game will drag even more.  If you want a game where everyone can act silly and attack each other, get Cash n Guns instead as it is a far superior game.

This is a monster brawl game in which you try to be the first player with a given number of points (and not die in the process).  You can either be in Tokyo, where you gain points every turn, dish out major damage to everyone simultaneously, but can't heal, or you're not in Tokyo, where you can only hurt the Tokyo monster and don't gain points, but can heal.  The core of the game is a Yahtzee mechanic--you reroll dice a bunch of times until you get what you want.  You can accumulate money to buy upgrade cards, but the game is so short that you don't really get too much into that.  Other than the pictures, the monsters are all the same.  The game is an okay filler.

One of the dumbest games I have ever played;  There is no strategy nor fun to be had.  Just because the designer is Mr MAGIC, doesn't mean his stuff doesn't stink.  The good ratings are real example of fan-boys at their worst.

RATING: 6
Initial rating of 8 after a couple of plays. Two players not so fun unless you each take two monsters. Game is pretty quick, almost so quick that it doesn't seem to make a ton of difference sometimes which cars you buy.

2014: Sold with the card promo, and Brokenbar promo - for a good amount of $, even after heavy play and with no insert!

Okay - well. Played this quite a bit. Had to force it every time. No one asked for it again, nor likely would have.

I kind of liked this game, but I think the theme just didn't resonate with any of the folks I played with. None of the kids were into "Godzilla" at ALL, and the few adults I played with thought the game was just "meh", a dice-chucker, with little strategy.

RATING: 6
Bardzo prosta gra, która polega na próbie utrzymania swojego potwora przy życiu przy jednoczesnej próbie uśmiercenia przeciwnika *wygrana przez eliminacje graczy) lub okazania się najbardziej potwronym z potworów (wygrana poprzez punkty).
Zasady są śmiesznie prosta, rozgrywka szybka. Jest dużo negatywnej interakcji, która poprzez humorystyczny wydźwięk gry nie jest taka negatywna. 
Gra cierpi na mechanice, która ma bezpośredni wpływ na to przy jakiej ilości graczy jest fajnie:
2 - bardzo słabo, praktycznie mechanika przebywania w Tokyo jest bez znaczenia
3,4 fajnie
5 - fajnie, pojawiają się w Tokyo 2 potwory, a po eliminacji pierwszych graczy, gra nie trwa na tyle długo żeby zabici się wynudzili
6 - dla pierwszych wyeliminowanych graczy jest to mordęga, bo tylko patrzą przez 20 minut i nic nie robią, słabe.

RATING: 9
Players control monsters ravaging the city of Tokyo. The monsters outside the city will attack the one inside. The guy inside will attack everyone outside, but can't heal unless it uses a special power. 

All of this is done through dice rolling a la yahtzee, with two re-rolls allowed. The dice have special symbols: a hand allows a monster to deal damage, a heart allows it to gain one health point (if the monster's outside the city), a lightning is worth one energy token (used to buy cards) and the numbers score points. If a monster's killed the player is out of the game. The first guy to reach 20 points, or the last monster standing is the winner. 

So, why is this great? 

Because it's so damn clever! The inside/outside Tokyo dynamic works very well, the cards add just the right amount of rule twisting and the the dice the indispensable randomness. There are two opposing paths to victory - points or last man standing - which demand very different approaches and, let's not be afraid of the words, strategies. 

And it's fun!

Fun simple dice rolling and risk taking with additional card mechanics.

Can be bad if there is early player elimination and a long game.

Every time I play I feel like there needs to be more energy handed out as the cards seem to be interesting but barely ever get used by more than 1 or 2 people and you barely ever move through more than the first few cards of the deck... Would love to play a game where you got something along the lines of 3 energy cubes per energy role and see what happened, limit of one card purchase per turn.

RATING: 4
Didn't much like this one. The artwork and bits are fantastic. The yahtzee mechanic is what it is.

The main problems is player elimination. Our group, instead of ganging up on the leader, predominantly sought to eliminate the weak as fast as possible. So some people are knocked out very early and go play something else.

The game didn't quite capture the King of the Mountain feel it is going for, nor the Godzilla defends Tokyo heavyweight title bought a la Rocky vs Klubba Lang/Apollo Creed/Ivan Drago feel it is trying to capture.

They can maybe figure it out with a later implementation, but this one is a swing and a miss.

It's just "King of the Hill" using special dice and some special action cards to try to roll your way to occupying the "Tokyo" spot on the very small gameboard.  If you like dice-fests where you try to wipe out your opponents this is a game for you.  It has some imaginative aspects: you roll 6 dice once and 0-6 dice two more times after that on your turn trying to get the best combination.  The dice have numbers and symbols on them: the numbers get you victory points (20 wins the game) and the symbols allow you to attack your opponents or add energy and health (recovery from battle wounds).  Last one standing or first to get 20 Victory Points is the winner.  There are also 3 face-up cards from a deck of several dozen that provide special powers, points and favors.  There is a small gameboard that is not used for anything except to show which player controls Tokyo at the moment.  Lucky rolls make a difference but the decisions you make about which dice to keep or re-roll play a big part in the game's outcome.  

A good game -- if you like dice-fests -- which I don't.   If you get tired of this dice-fest apparently there are expansion games that will offer additional variety to the play.

I played this one a lot before logging plays, so it must have about 15.

It is a fun dice chucking game, easy to teach, easy to get into. It is a great gateway game for young people and it goes by quick.

I played it a lot so I sometimes kind of skip it, but sometimes you just want to throw some dice and feel like you're destroying cities.

Totally recommend the power-up expansion

(4 plays) Without the expansions, a little too complicated to be called a party game.  With the expansions, way too complicated to be called a party game.  Unless your party is with geeks that don't mind an hour of strategic waffling and managing special ability cards.

Pros:
* Easy to learn.
* Great theme - who does not like large monsters?
* Re-roll mechanic works great for this game.
* Quality components - player cards with dials are elegant.
* Well balanced - makes all gamers equal.

Cons:
* Some power cards are fairly useless.
* Strategy is limited but still there.

Garfield does yahtzee, and he does it well. Excellent filler! Most light filler games involve playing cards, but there's just something special about grabbing a handful of dice, rolling, and seeing what comes up. There's a hint of tactics and choices, but the dice determine pretty much everything. And surprisingly, that's ok. The theme makes it potentially less suitable for playing with my family, but it also makes it so much fun that I can see this getting a ton of play as a closer on game nights.

Fun, interesting, easy to learn/teach, great dice game that I describe as "yatzee with monsters".  I enjoy when casual gamers judge me for breaking this game out because it looks silly, then they quickly get into it and we have a great time. We always play at least 4 games in a session. Minimal setup/teardown, great mechanics and huge replayability.

Most of the games in the Yahtzee family fail. Yes they are variants but so many are so dull (the Settlers dice game is a perfect example). The two best, to date are Roll Through the Ages and King of Tokyo. Where King of Tokyo surpasses RTtA is in the fun factor. Both play quickly but RTtA is too 'serious' while KoT takes the mechanics and adds fun. Is it a great game...no. However it is short, easy to teach and fun. King of Tokyo reminds me of the final battle in Monsters Menace (Ravage) America. However, it skips the foreplay and goes right to the.... What else do you want?

Had heard a lot about this and it seemed popular at the local group. First time I have got to play it and its ok, it feels more luck dominated than I normally like but I did enjoy it, but unsure about repeated playings. - The Jury is still out!

Brainless, but good fun if played in the right spirit and not overanalysed. Expansions worthwhile, though Power-Up more so. Would recommend either a second copy or Halloween for a second set of dice. (And, two groups of four playing off for winners/losers into a final/wooden spoon match.)

I don’t think it’s a very well designed game, but it is quite fun. At heart, it’s just another Yahtzee-style dice-roller, but the dice combinations aren’t very interesting and the decisions seem mostly obvious. A lot of the fun comes from the Alien Frontiers-style special power cards. Needs to be played fast and furious - it’s not a strategy game and ponderous play would be particularly annoying if you got eliminated early.

UPDATE: not sure what I was talking about here. It's expertly designed for the type of experience it wants to create.

9.5 - It's a simple game that is a ton of fun, I would like something a little deeper for a 10 but it's definitely making the regular rotation.

there's a little competitiveness that comes with the game, when one person is close to 20 victory points other monsters seem to gang up on them which is the only reason I give it a Light-Medium instead of a Light.

On paper this ought to be a really fun game; it's quick, simple, has oodles of player interaction and at least two paths to victory. However there are a couple of serious flaws. The first is the dependence on player elimination, which might not seem to matter given the quick playing time. But the second is variable playing time: Certain cards (like the one that gives -5 VP to everyone) can really slow the game down - so you could be sitting out for 45 minutes or more in rare cases.

An incredibly simple dice rolling game where you try and either kill your opponents or rack up 20 VP. Very light, very simple, and I'd say a decent game if it cost $10, but its usual price is far too high. Have heard the first expansion really improves the game by making each monster unique, but an expansion shouldn't fix a game, it should expand it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very good filler! Simple but functional mechanics and fun theme. Yes, it's a dice game and the luck factor is high, but players may direct their (simple) strategy. Playing time is short and more than one game are easily playable during a play session.
It's a pity the monsters result all identical; I would have appreciated a personal, unique ability for each of them.
Components are good.. except for the dice: why they're not carved...? They are the game-core after all...
Energy cubes are great! Rubbery miniatures would have been better than paper stands - but that's just a finesse.

Really fun for what it is. The market meta is not that strong with way too many possible cards. That being said, putting one player on the sightlines for everyone else is a fun idea. The rerolling means that the RNG is less likely to screw you over. Dice games will lack depth but this is a great way to incorporate dice in a way that actually requires some strategy.

Maybe you have some non-gamer friends. Maybe they have no interest in playing games whatsoever. Maybe you haven't been able to play games with them because you know they'd think board games are lame.

King of Tokyo is the game you want to show them. You tell them it's a game about smashing each other, you explain the rules in two minutes, and you start playing.

And it will be awesome, 100% guaranteed.

I've never played a game that delivers what it promises as consistently as King of Tokyo. Yeah, it's filler. But it's filler that lets you pursue different strategies, has a lot of direct player interaction, and has enough variety to play several games in a single night and never be bored.

There's a lot to like about this game, but the best thing is that it's simple enough to be played (and enjoyed!) by almost anyone while still complex enough to provide all but the most complexity-craving experts with interesting decisions. The second best thing (or best, depending on your viewpoint) is that it's short (30 mins max). This makes the player elimination less of a problem.

[EDIT: I played this with a different group and it was not short. They took foreeeeeeeeever. It made te game way less fun...you really need to keep the game moving for this one to work]

King of Tokyo is a great game that can appeal to a very wide range of players. I absolutely recommend trying this no matter what type of player you are, and that's not something I can say for very many games.

Enjoyable because it was quick.  Might be annoying if it took longer.  Cards didn't have much of an effect on the game and was actually hard to purchase many (if any) of before someone else focusing on getting victory points would win.

After several more plays, found that card purchasing could be a viable option to develop a tactic around.

Very pleasant game of meaningful dice rolling. Well designed and produced, doesn't play too long. Player round is very quick, as it's just couple of rolls, resolve and then pass to the next player. Obviously it's also very random, so if you don't like dice, it's not for you.

To me, it's Quarriors simplified. I love Quarriors, but I feel that you have more decisions there to make and it can get quite deep, despite dice roll. Here, it's simple, easy and if you can't get Quarriors to table, or just want a quick entry level game for kids, this one is definitely a hit. But it cannot match the stream of Quarriors dice rattling in a bag :)

A fun theme and competitive gameplay for almost any age.  My only complaint about the game is that it doesn't last long enough to really utilize enough of the special cards.

Also, it is a lot more fun with the more people involved.  2 player games can get lop-sided quickly with little chance of any comeback.

RATING: 7.5
Reduced rating from 8.5 to 7.5 because the base rules really lead to an uninspired game play where whoever rolls 3's wins. I'd raise it to 8.5 or perhaps 9 if I could figure out the right combination of house-rules to improve the game.

(original comment) Just a lot of dice-rolling fun.  The theme goes a LONG way with me, and the short time making the inevitable vagaracies of luck more bearable.

Only problem with the rules to me was the lack of victory points for staying in Tokyo 1 whole turn. 2 measly VPs for surviving that many attacks (in larger player games) is not nearly enough motivation to suffer so much risk.

After thinking about it, I want to try the number of VP's = # of players still in the game
For example, if there's 2 players, it's 2 VPs.
4 players, 4 VP's for starting the turn in Tokyo.
And for 6 players, it's 6 VP.
Yes, this sounds overpowering. However, I strongly feel the game should be decided by whoever conquers Tokyo the most/longest, AND even 6 VP's is not that much compared to "3" rolls and cards, AND you have to take your lumps and stay in Tokyo all the way to your next turn. It should give motivation to the players to beat the crap out of the ballsy monster in the city. In a 6-player game, a monster would have to stay in Tokyo till their 5th straight turn to win!

Other possible house rules:
Nobody is going to use 3 1's to score one measly VP unless they are the last dice to come up. 
All 1's should be Energy. Energy is the entire currency which is required to make the game more than just a dice-throwing luck-fest. There needs to be more energy available to the players, and eliminating the 1 and making it an Energy seems an easy way to do that.

Oh - house rule #3 : 
All players start with 3 Energy. Gets the action and choices happening faster.

Other potential house rules:
a) Use 5 face-up cards instead of 3 (or maybe 1 per player?)
b) Wings may be overpowered - remove the card from the game
c) At beginning of game, draw 5 cards and keep up to 7 Energy's worth of cards  OR  Everyone starts with 1 Keep card and gets Energy equal to the difference between their card and the highest player's card.
d) Cards may be bought before you roll dice.
e) A rolled Energy is worth 2 Energy cubes, not 1.
(not actively considering the following) f) Every opponent's turn you are in Tokyo, you get 1 Energy.
g) When in Tokyo, after resolving dice, you get 1 free wipe of the cards, if desired.

Area control and fighting game that serves as a great gateway to boardgaming. The theme is silly and flippant, while still true to a competitive type game.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game. Usually, Richard Garfield's non-ccg games aren't very successful with me, but this dice filler with its fun kaiju theme, and well produced bits won me over. The pacing of the game seems like it could be a little better, in terms of acquiring variable powers via the cards and having those powers effect the game, but on the plus side this plays pretty quickly, which is a must for a game ultimately this light. I've had a lot of success introducing non-hobby gamers to this game. 

However. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that sometimes the game can drag if players aren't having any luck eliminating each other and some of the more "take that" cards, which set players back, get bought and played. But more often than not, the game plays quickly and is good for a few laughs. This has become one of my go to games to break out to play with people who aren't dedicated hobby game enthusiasts.

The theme is fun but player elimination is always a weak design choice and this is no different. Also, the cards are not balanced/priced well and this lasts too long.

Fun game, easy to teach, and kids can play.  My 5 year old was able to learn and play this game.  Mechanics are very simple.  The game play essentially involves rolling 6 dice, choosing which ones you want to keep, and rolling again.  You may then once again choose which dice to keep, and make one last roll for the dice you don't want to keep.  The strategy is in deciding which dice to keep, and deciding how long you want to stay in Tokyo.  Otherwise, the game is very luck based.

The only thing I don't like about this game is that if you get killed early, you may have to wait around a while before the game ends.  Thankfully, the game time isn't too long, so it's not that big of a problem.  Additionally, 5-6 player games aren't as fun as 3-4 player games, in my opinion, because of the longer down time before your next turn.

In summary, it's a nice simple game, that is good for families.

School game.

The base game is ok, but the expansion offers a definite improvement on the playing experience. King of Tokyo is just a more fun version of Yahtzee and I always liked that game as a kid. A shame about the player elimination - I think any game that includes that element is likely to lose a point from me.

Another game that the kids love, but that I can break it out at the gaming group and it will be well received.  Chucking dice and trash talking are a great feature to this.  It is a good 'filler game', since it will only last for 30-45 minutes.  I do worry about the replayability of the game, but so far so good.

I still can't believe how fun this game is. Maybe it's the cartoonish monsters or the cool dice or even the ability to pull a buddy into Tokyo to feel the wrath of everyone else, but King of Tokyo seems to be a winner with gamers and casuals alike. The goal is simple: either destroy all other monsters or get 20 victory points. Getting to either goal is not hard to understand, but for some reason people's strategies crash in flames in every game in which I've played. It's not the randomness of the dice rolls that does it (you get two re-rolls after the first roll), but it's one inflexibility to accept what one rolls that often rings the death knell of the hapless player.

KAIJUUUUU! A cute little 'King of the hill' strategy title with great art. It is fairly easy to pick up (we have a 6 year old that LOVES to play it) and play. There are plenty of powerups to buy/combine/steal that makes the experience a little different each time. Will you get the most stars while your opponents duke it out? Or utterly obliterate your opponents and claim your place as king of Tokyo?

A loud, fun romp that can be played several times in an evening. This makes  up for the time you'll spend outside the ring after being eliminated. The "gatcha" factor can be high, but if everyone is in the right spirit, getting thrown off the mountain by an 8-year-old is almost as fun as being King Monster of Tokyo!  Recommended as a solid gateway for non-gamers with short attentions spans. Just get a copy and have some fun.

King of Tokyo gets better every time I play it. One of the few games I own where it gets better the more players involved. The art style is fantastic, especially on the upgrade cards, which all have some really innovative and fun abilities.

There's a lot of luck involved but everyone seems to enjoy tossing these hefty dice around. I don't think I've ever won a game of King of Tokyo, but who cares? It plays fast and always entertains.

Rolling dice is fun, especially when they are big chunky ones! I was initially put off by the whole monster theme and the idea of the special action cards, but once I played it, I was instantly hooked. The cards are such a fun element of this game that provides lots of replay ability. Speaking of that, when I play a game of this it is almost always followed up by one or two more games of this. This is one of a very select few games that is equally enjoyable with kids and adults. Even non-gamers that I got to play this have enjoyed it!

RATING: 8.5
pros :

1)Quick playtime makes it easy to get several games in.
2)Artwork is very pleasing to the eye and fits the theme well.
3)King of the hill mechanic also blends well with theme.
4)I like the "purchasing" of powers with the cards.
5)High fun factor especially if players "get into" their roles.

Cons:
1)Quick playtime maybe a bit too quick?  I would like a little more time to get powers to differentiate the creatures more.  Perhaps a variant to start with a power?  
2)can get eliminated quickly if dice decide to hose you, but at least you won't have to wait too long for another go.

Looking forward to getting the power up expansion.

Great game.  Quick, engaging, fun.   Surprisingly satisfying to add characteristics to your monster via the cards.

It uses the Yahtzee mechanism.  Roll the dice 3 times (keeping what you like each time).  the dice allow you to attack other monsters, heal yourself, score victory points, or store up energy so you can buy special powers (cards) later.

Key question:  How long can I stay in Tokyo without getting killed??

Those who say the game is like Yatzee are ignoring the king of the hill elements of the game.  

This is a clever design which gets a lot of fun out of a very small rule set.  However if people are determined to roll for hearts (until they are at maximum health) the game play is duller and slower.  But this sort of turtling is punished (an aggressive monster in the center will demolish them).  The game is more fun when people take risks, roar, and make sound effects, cackle etc.

Surprisingly, this game does not have the feel of 'gang up on the leader'.  If you are in the center everyone gangs up on you, but you CHOSE to be there and can leave promptly if you want to.  (This paragraph is a bit over simplified.)  Still, it has a more fun dynamic than most games where everyone hoses the leader because in this game the leader decides their self to step into the line of fire.

The game might play out, but for now, (2 plays), I am eager to try it again.

My favourite dice rolling game with an engaging theme, nice comic art work and really chunky dice! Still there are some decisions: play defensively or offensively; try to reach 20 points this turn, but be vulnarable if you fail... 

Some plays might get a bit stale if you really have bad luck or get eliminated quickly. But since the play time is not that long, you can easily do another game. In total, still my most favourite game to play after a long and brain-burny Euro game (but usually with Power Up! expansion). Without  the Power Up! expansion I would only rate it an 8 (even maybe 7.5). The expansion adds very little, but this can still make quite a difference in such light game.

Not much to it but good fun nonetheless.  The imperatives change quite dramatically from 2 to 3 to 4 players (haven't played with more than 4 yet), The fewer the players the more likely people are to pursue victory by being last man standing.  Whereas with 4 players no one  wants to stick around in Tokyo for long, preferring instead to accumulate VP.  My 5 year old loves it - he has the rules sorted and remembers what each of the cards do once we read them to him.

This is a simple dice game.Monsters in Tokyo attack monsters outside and vice-versa. The monsters in Tokyo score victory points but cannot regain life points. Players can win by scoring twenty victory points or by killing all the other monsters.
Its random, silly, and realtively quick, which makes it an okay filler game but only an okay one.

26-12-2013 Had this a year now and still is great fun.
02-02-2013 this is a 9 for me.  With the expansion it just adds that little bit more to do when in Tokyo.
As a filler:
 - its easy to teach,taking less than 5 mins.
 - fun to play, who doesn't want to be an evil bunny.
 - doesn't outstay its welcome, even if there is player      elimination, players can cheer on for their favourite monster.

RATING: 7
Dice-based monster combat, with different ways to win (do you try to kill everyone else, or stay out of trouble while acquiring victory points?), and a pretty large deck of purchasable cards with special powers, meaning no two games will ever be quite the same. This is great fun if one is in the mood and doesn't feel like anything too heavy. And the expansion makes it even better by introducing extra abilities which are unique to each monster. Indeed, I would now say that the expansion is essential to the game, in the sense that I never want to play without it.

Great game for up to 6 players. The more players the better! Luck is really crucial in this game and there is only one copy of each card except two. So you better buy it when you have the chance. There is some strategy involved in dice choices and whether or not you decide to occupy Tokyo.

RATING: 2
For ages 8 and up, and I suggest that you bring an 8 year old so that at least one of you enjoys it.

OK, it's a "fun" game.  It's not meant to be serious or deep.  You can ham it up, stomp on opponents' cards, make your own fun.

But the mechanism is deeply flawed - it's just far too random.  You can't pick a strategy, you can only go with whatever dice you rolled, sometimes to your detriment.

Holding or ceding Toyko is too gross a decision, and often doesn't make that much of a difference anyway. You don't have any choice about moving in, and you need to take at least one bout of clawing before you can bail out, which can be fatal.

The cards are a real mess, and there are too many of them to be able to base any sort of strategy around them.  There are a couple that can be useful if you're lucky enough to roll a bunch of energy very early on when they're showing, but again that's a pure luck gambit.

Two or three player games are just a claw-fest, four or more players turns into a race for points while desperately trying to avoid becoming the temporary occupier of Tokyo, a curious conceit considering the theme of the game.

In brief:

To complicated to play drunk, too pointless to play sober.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The general consensus is that King of Tokyo is not a very good 2 player game. I disagree. Sure it may be more fun with more than two, but 2 is very fun. The only rule change I suggest is that players still receive 2 coins when they start their turn in Tokyo, but do not receive the 1 coin for entering Tokyo. Love the chunky dice. Great game.

It wasn't as bad as I thought. There is a tactical element, unlike most other dice games which are mostly random, and the 'push your luck' element sort of works. Ultimately though any gameplay based on rolling a bunch of D6 is never going to impress me, and this one is no exception.

It's interesting I can fight randomness in this game quite well (maybe that lovely huge cubes are fond of me :D). It should be quick game, though last time I've blocked my opponents just because of combo of two cards (don't remember their names), that gave me the ability to gaing energy tokens quickier and to spend them and negate any damage - so I was just staying in the Tokyo blocking everything with just three lives and have won only because of that. But there were only three of us left, if I've tried this strategy with more people, I wouldn't have chance to last a round.

6.9.13 There is a lot to like in this game. Starting with its price. The game is easy to teach and look pretty good all setup; nothing stellar, but does it well. Lots to do each turn like scoring points, doing damage, healing, or getting energy. While your goal is to score 20 points or kill all the other monsters, the cards and dice make sure each game is fresh and unique. 
A big hit with my game group and I give it an 8.

4.1.14 Introducing this to players at my work. Again it went over well. A great lunch time game that gives you that direct conflict rush without too much conflict. The theme keeps it light so it works perfect for that.

RATING: 8
It's very fun especially if you get into the role of monsters smacking each other for control of Tokyo. Rules are straightforward and simple, making it very easy to learn.

It heavily involves dice rolling, so it's pretty luck-based; however, since it runs quick, it doesn't make it irritating if you are getting bad rolls or if your opponent is getting particularly good rolls - just wait out until the game finishes.

There is still some strategy (when to leave Tokyo, should I try to get 20 points or just smack everyone around, etc), though it is not as deep as other games.

The biggest point of contention, aside from the luck factor, is the presence of player elimination. While the game usually runs quick, eliminated players still have to wait quite a while to play again either because of getting eliminated too early or if the rest of the players are using "turtle" strategies. Nonetheless, eliminated players can still have fun while watching. 

Another possible gripe is there are some games wherein you can't really do much given an early multi-claw roll from your opponents, leaving you the rest of the game trying to roll for hearts. There are also dead turns, where you are having bad rolls wherein you can't do anything for that turn. The game is quite short, though, so these things aren't as bad as they seem.

It's a great game to play when one doesn't want to burn their brain cells and have fun. I would play this given the chance.

A build'em (victory points) bash'em (hit points) type of game.  Keep it light and the game is much more enjoyable.  Stop to think to hard and the game can slow to a crawl.  As player's start with nothing - there is bit of a decision - start to be aggressive early before defenses can be built up, or build up energy (and then cards) before attempting to be more confrontational.  Of course, rolling a hand forces one into Tokyo when it is empty, so not much one can do other than respond to the dice you do get.  Don't over think this one...take it lightly as a filler.

Good, not great, pick up and play game.  It's not much fun with 2 players at all, but it does get more interesting with 3-4 people playing.

Very good dice game for the whole family. Lots of fun.

But, anyway, I enjoy this game a lot.

Each player takes the role of a giant monster who starts with ten points of health and zero victory points. Either be the first monster to reach 20 points or eliminate every other opponent to win the game. The gameplay is simple as players roll six dice up to three times (like yahtzee) and apply the effects to the appropriate monsters. Fun? Heck, yeah! Lots of tabletalk and social interaction for all the players involved. This game should be a part of everyone's collection.

I didn't want to give this game as high a rating at first, because I'm not as much into luck-based games, but all my kids love it, which makes me love it more. There's a bit of strategy in so much as there's strategy in Yahtzee, because the dice are rolled and re-rolled in a similar manner. It's really clever, and the pieces are very colorful and creatively designed. There's a large element of luck with dice rolling and card drawing, which means the young kids have a more even chance of beating the older kids and grown-ups. It also has the advantage of being a short game, so you can play it a few times in a row if you want. For example, Kid: "Let's go again!", Parent: "I'd love to, but it's almost midnight."

The game plays quickly and the duration is good—usually playing more than one game in a sitting. If a player gets eliminated, they don't have to wait long for the next game. Downtime is pretty short, giving just enough time to think about what you would like to do next turn. Non-active players get attacked during another person's turn, giving them something to do during the downtime. 

The downside to short games is that there's not enough time to use many of the power-up cards, however I wouldn't want the game to last much longer than it does.

Two Player Value = Fair. Good game, just better with more players.


King of Tokyo is a simple dice game turned into a free-for-all brawl. It is silly and light. Nothing fancy or complicated.

In King of Tokyo players fight to victory. There are two methods of victory, the first to 20 points or eliminating all other players. Easy.

The whole game revolves around the dice roll. On your turn you get 3 rolls to build the best "hand" of dice. Then you use those dice to effect the game. You can attacks other players, heal yourself, score points or buy powerful cards to help you are hurt others. Players can also score points by controlling Tokyo.

The design is simple and efficient. The game is very basic, but it is meant to be. That is what makes it fun. It is supposed to be silly and light party game.

Everything else is fine, but not incredible. Rules. Artwork. Components. Theme. 

This game is very good with younger and new gamers.


Pros - 
- Easy to teach and learn
- Good party game


Cons - 
- Very simple game play could turn some away

The first expansion for King of Tokyo is [thing=127067][/thing].

This is a small and simple expansion, but it offers a good game play boost.

This expansion provides a small deck of cards for each character that gives the characters new powerful abilities.  Players can buy these power cards with dice.

I like the added game play mechanic and it really helps round out the game.

Because of this it will raise the overall rating of the game slightly.

I was a bit fan of The Creature that Ate Sheboygan, so when I saw this, I was intrigued. What really caught my eye was the Kraken. To paraphrase The Big Bang Theory, playing the Kraken must be fun, because you get to say, "Release the Kraken". :D

On very short list of Ameritrash games that amuse me. A little.
2017 update: boost this rating at least 1 point for a three-player game. I realize now that I've been involved in mostly higher player counts. But it turns out that watching others play Yahtzee is not really great fun, but doing so yourself is alright. So three-player speeds right along, with every bit as interesting a decision space. Much better for me personally.

Dice pool game. Roll dice to get either a set (3 of a kind) or have other effects. Doesn't add much to your library if you already have a dice-rolling game (eg. Elder Sign). Cards need clarification (eg. Is "a turn" the same thing as "every player's turn" or "your turn") and a misread card can overpower the game.

I could comment on the almost flawless design that embraces fun and interaction over all else. I could praise the terrific production, with it's excellent illustrations and components.

But instead I can only say that King of Tokyo is perhaps the best light game I've ever played. It's so effortless, so intuitive, and so direct that I have trouble thinking of any short game that has ever accomplished those things better. This is more than a filler: this is the best game from 2011.

Yahtzee b/w punching! Turns go quickly and tend to involve everyone, as no one player is in the middle very long. The ability cards offer a myriad of enhancements to your monster, and all of them are exciting to try out (there are some wicked combos hidden in there, too). The game can vary wildly in its trajectory and ending, but it's so brief that this variation only makes you want to play again and try another tactic.

I personally don't love this game. It's over before you get the most out of your powers, it's kinda swingy, and player elimination sucks.

But you have to know its audience. This is a gateway game -- perhaps the BEST gateway game -- for people who are used to rolling dice. I've never had a bad game of it and that gives me a great deal of second-hand enjoyment. Just don't expect more out of it than it can offer.

RAAAAH! I always look at this on my shelf and say "what is that kids game doing there? I really should get rid of it, or put it in the kids' collection, so I can get a better game in there."

But then I play it...and right back on my collection shelf it goes. I've never not had fun here. Kudos, Garfield.

I'll say it again, just so you all know: THE STARS ARE HOW MANY BUILDINGS YOU"VE EATEN. I don't know why people get so confused, try to make it less thematic by calling it fame, or twitter followers or whatever. Even the rules get confused on this point! Foolishness. It's obvious, and makes the game better once you realize this. Try it.

Have no interest in playing King of New York. Why would I want to take a good 30 min whiz-bang silly fun game and make it longer and game-ier? If I want a more complex game I'll play wiz-war or Tammany Hall or something. This is perfect for what it is. I don't even use the evolution cards, though I have them. Appreciate the game for what it is, I say.

This is a king of the hill game. It has to be played aggressively to be fun. With people who like to sneak to victory playing a passive strategy, the game is boring.

Had a horrible first play of this in a 5 player game. The first player jumped into Tokyo to attack everyone, never left it, and the rest of us got murdered by him and the person who jumped into the bay area space within only a few turns.

King of Tokyo is a light fun and humorous game where you take control of a monster and give it special abilities to destroy more of Tokyo or destroy your fellow monsters quicker. It's relatively devoid of strategy and is very luck based due to dice-rolling. It's fairly short and the game changes with more players (with 5-6 there is an extra spot in the city to rampage). Worth playing with young kids or with older people looking for some filler fun.

Oh yeah, for a Yahtzee type game it's okay. Some decisions to be made and the usual dice angst. They've mixed card abilities into the mix, which is a nice idea, but unlike To Court the King there's not much of a power buildup. Player elimination isn't a problem because the game is quick, but with big groups I'd rather play Coup or The Resistance. Still looking for a really interesting dice roller - Ra the Dice Game and Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck seem to be winning at this point.

RATING: 8
King of Tokyo is unbelievable fun. It's a spin on the Yacht roll-reroll-reroll-stop mechanism with power cards and (mostly) passive-aggressive player interaction. I think the passive-aggressive interaction is what makes this game. There's no politicking, "Why did you hit me?!", "Because you were in Tokyo, duh. Why were you in Tokyo??". Most often your attacks are directed at everyone else, or the player in Tokyo. Offering little decision about what to do with your attack power (only cards you buy allow decisions) keeps this game on track, it's a real lean game design that travels full speed as soon as someone takes Tokyo and never allows players the chance to even slow it down. Excellent, rock-solid design, I can't get enough of this.

Over rated game or maybe just doesn't fit the group as no one likes it.

Chunky dice are nice but you cannot easily see the scores/health of others so half the time you need to ask them (annoying), throw out random damage or try to remember everything which isn't what i want from a throwaway game. Power cards don't get bought enough which is a shame for the main interest. I could use many varients on it but that would change most of the game.

FUN... is one word I use to describe this to other people especially muggles who is a Virgin for board gaming. And if it's fun. It's a nice gateway game that never fails it's purpose. The one it lacks probably the value of replayabilty. Once you master it you probably want something more challenging. Sure there's some expansion to tackle this issue but let's just talk about the base game. There's not much strategy you can do here. You may not play this repeatedly with your adult friends, but with your children this might be a house favorite. I personally will play this game only if I want a fun easy game on my game night and of course to lure other muggles to join my board gaming passion. It's like honey to Pooh bear. Sugar to ants. And blood to mosquitos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First and foremost to remember is this is filler, and probably better if you're drunk. Each player represents a monster getting victory points for destroying Tokyo while fending off other monsters who want to get into Tokyo to do the same. It's a dice rolling game: roll, hold any back, and reroll up to two more times. Roll energy to take energy cubes, which you can use to buy cards. These cards give you extra powers, or just annoy the hell out of everyone. Roll hearts to heal, but note that you can't heal while you're in Tokyo. Roll a set of three matching numbers to get victory points. Or roll a claw to attack the monster in Tokyo (or ALL other monsters if you're already in Tokyo). If you damage a monster in Tokyo they have the option to leave, and the attacker must then enter Tokyo. You get points for entering Tokyo, and points for staying in Tokyo a whole round. Win by reaching a number of victory points or by killing all the other monsters. Great fun in the right crowd, but strictly filler.

King of Tokyo is an okay party style dice game. I wish the dice were a little smaller, so that they were easier to roll. Fairly random, and player elimination can be frustrating if someone is knocked out of the game early, and they have nothing to do.

RATING: 7.5
(This rating is based on playing the 1st edition with the Power Up! expansion)

I initially bought this game as a gateway game that I expected to be fun enough... but not something I would play regularly or with experienced gamers.  Turns out that after 40+ plays I'm still really enjoying it(although it does need the expansion).  Some people find it to be a total luck fest but I think there is definitely enough important decisions to keep it interesting.  And it is also so quick to bring out/play/pack up which a big reason it gets pulled out more than I was expecting.

All Yahtzee-family games have been dry and boring. Not so with King of Tokyo, where the card upgrades provide an excellent shot in the arm. It also combats the "all faces of the die are good in their own way" syndrome by layering VPs and health on the game as trade-offs. The two objectives conflict through the decision on whether to man up in Tokyo, resulting in great dynamism in deciding what to go for with the dice.

This is the best '3-attempt' dice game by far, and it has brought the fun back to the retread genre.

It doesn't scale very well, however. All Yahtzee descendants play best with 2 or 3 intrinsically due to downtime, but with KoT, the lowered viability of being King in Tokyo with more players further deteriorates the game at higher player counts. It's reached the stage where nobody dares to go into Tokyo. Think about it: with 6 players, that's at least 5 turns of people whacking you, and at least 10 other-player turns before you get a chance to heal, if you want the 2 VP. I want to try the "Gain 1 energy at the start of each player turn while you're in Tokyo" variant if we play with 5 or 6.

[hr]
Nah, I think the player scaling is fine, just different. Live and adapt. It just raises the stakes for going into Tokyo, which all players then account for. Raised design from 4 to 5.

5+3

bought summer, 2012

A solid filler game for gamers of all ages.  Truly a game that could fit in any collection.  The only "issue," as I see it, is the game mechanic reward of sitting in Tokyo.  Is there not enough incentive to stay in Tokyo?  Easily tweaked with house-rules, depending on how you feel about the issue.  Great fun, plays quick, would not turn a game down.

Update (November 2012):  having now played this with a couple different groups, I have to say that it really shines with older kids (8-13).  That's the group I want to play it with.  For adults (incl. non-gamers) it's still good filler, but I don't find it nearly as entertaining.  Downgrading to a 7 (from 8), since it's still a fun design - just not the knock-out I thought it might be.

A beat down royal rumble game that constantly humbles the hard core gamers in our group. With this much random dice rolling it is usually the case that our daughter wins with her all claw roll versus my carefully planned victory point strategy. I don't usually like random dice games but this one, with it's head to head fighting and special roll cards with the power up expansion is a family favorite. So much so that we built a dice box especially for this game.

I really wanted to like this game. I like the theme and so many other people love it. And it's by Richard Garfield! But no matter how many times we forced ourselves to play it, my wife and I just could not get into this game. There are other dice rolling games I like (like Elder Sign), so it's not that. Maybe it's because there's just not enough there with this game. It's just dice rolling and not whole lot else. I feel there are better light/intro games or dice rolling games depending on what you are looking for. This game isn't the worst; it's just fine.

King of Tokyo -- 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wow. Logic fails a bit in deducing why this game is as good as it is. 
1. It's attacking, but this attacking while simple has a balance to it and never turns into random bashing: you're either attacking monsters in Tokyo, or you're in Tokyo and risk getting beaten - but you can attack everybody outside. 
2. Another balance is between 2 goals - gathering VPs and attacking everyone else. I mostly ignore all the points and just make stupid sounds and try to kill everyone. 
3. THEME. With so little overhead (esentially the game is a bit of risk taking with a bit of yahtzee and special powers thrown in for chaos and amusing effects) the theme takes over and makes everyone behave stupidly. And all the time it balances on the border between party games and family type fillers. 

Masterpiece - both in terms of design and in  graphic direction.

Filler de dados muy divertido, en el que los jugadores son monstruos tipo Godzilla y tendrán que aguantar el máximo tiempo posible en Tokio para ganar puntos... pero los demás jugadores intentarán eliminar al jugador que esté en Tokio y arrebatarle el sitio.
El juego es tipo Yatzee, pero mucho más divertido, pues a parte de los mamporros, hay multitud de cartas que le dán habilidades especiales a los monstruos.
En un principio, me pareció un juego muy caro para lo que trae, pero es lo merece, pues es uno de los juegos más divertidos y sencillos a los que he jugado en mucho tiempo. Muy recomendado para jugar 6 jugadores.

Do not look here for a deep game, it's a dicefest. But a very good one. It reminds me of Yahtzee style games I played as a child. But it adds a strong flavor.

King of Tokyo is essentially a board game-ized King of the Hill. It's straightforward, simple to pick up, and a lot of fun.

It works great with people that aren't hardcore gamers, too!

KOT was the first game we bought when we started getting back into the hobby a few years ago (2013). It came highly recommended as a gateway game. As our tastes developed, however, the game lost much of its appeal. The only time it made it to the table was when I was volunteering during game night at a local library (younger kids enjoyed it); needless to say, we never played it any more, and we've come to the conclusion that we don't care much for games that focus exclusively on attacking the other player(s) (and especially at 2p, where every decision becomes entirely rote).

I don't regret owning it, per se. It's simply time to move on.

RATING: 7
Crazy dice game where each player takes on a stereotypical kaiju seeking either 20VP or to annihilate all others. There's little strategy to the game, although from my experience a defensive strategy at the start is preferable. The tactics, however, run deeper than it initially seems as attacking Tokyo can be a double-edged sword. Even after 5 games, I've miraculously never been able to end up in the final showdown. Plays best with 4, and my one 5 player game took an hour to complete. But everyone had fun, so they didn't notice the time anyway.

#65 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Another classic gateway game. I should try introducing this one to my family at some point. The roll three times to try and get the best result is easy to pick up thanks to classic Yahtzee. Players try to be the first to collect a certain amount of points, which can be gained through die rolls and through occupying Tokyo. Staying in Tokyo is scary though as it makes you vulnerable to attacks from other players. If your health reaches zero, you're eliminated. I recommend playing with the Power Up expansion as it gives each monster their own unique deck of card abilities you can trigger throughout the game. We have the Halloween expansion as well, but I haven't played with it yet.

RATING: 8.5
Fun, well-made Yahtzee variant with a monsters theme.

Players are monsters trying to be 'King of Tokyo' by scoring 20VPs or knocking all other monsters out. 6 dice are rolled with two re-rolls allowed. Players score VPs for rolling at least 3 of a kind of 1, 2 or 3 VPs. Other possible rolls include gaining life, energy cubes (used to buy effects cards) or attack.

In a neat twist, there's a Tokyo board where a monster (or two if you're playing it 5 or 6 players) can occupy. You can't heal in Tokyo but gain 1VP for entry and another 2VP each time you start on Tokyo.

The graphic design is very good and the game plays fast enough and scales well. Well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Whenever I play we alter the rules just slightly; instead of taking one energy, take two when you roll the energy dice. We found that without this rule it got a little boring. By changing just this one thing the whole game dynamic is changed by people  buying cards frequently.

Fell for the hype and got this at premium price.

I'm sure some uber geeks will be wetting themselves over this, but so far I've found it a bit pfft!!

I like a good dice roller, but the power up cards are not great... either not worth it or too powerful.

In the end we just tried rolling for numbers and avoided going to Tokyo so not to take a pummeling.

UPDATE: After a 4 player game. Everyone quite liked the idea, but again had issues with the cards, as hardly any were used before the game came to a sudden end. Thus still a bit of an anti-climax... 

2nd UPDATE: Just played a 6P with my mates 3 boys (Ages 8, 9 and 10), and they really enjoyed it. Thus this is where I feel the game belongs... more older child/teen group. Also game lasted nearly an hour (again mainly due to passive play), but at least a load of cards got used and did add to the enjoyment.

Despite this, for me, rating staying the same

Games seemed to quickly devolve into players merely rolling to attack each other.  As a result, any real strategy went out the window and it came down to who could get the luckiest dice rolls.  This made the scoring and the power-up cards feel superfluous.

Dicefest with cool monsters - nuff said
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I can't find any great flaws with this game. It's short, funny, and can bring out the real monster in people (makes monster noises). It can be taught to almost anyone and can be fun for people new to board games as well as more advanced players. 

All of the monsters have the same stats, which I like, but the expansion does add unique abilities making each monster stand out.

Get this game.

+ King of Tokyo: Power Up!

Fun, fast filler. When we have someone new to board games we invariably end up playing this, and then everyone wants to play this again.

I play with the draft variant from the BGG forums:

* All players draw five upgrade cards, then we draft those five cards. Take one, pass the rest, etc, usual draft. The cheapest card starts in play, and you can buy the other cards that you drafted (and no others) with energy as usual
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great game and one to introduce new gamers too. I have played this game well over 30 times and it is with out doubt the most played game I have. 

Games take between 15-45 mins and can end in either the winner claiming all the victory points first or killing off all the other opponents.

Micsoda kivitelezés! Óriási szörnyek, hatalmas kockák, gyönyörű kártyák. Rögtön megvett a játék. Sima kockapóker megbolondítva vehető kártyákkal és tokyói tombolással. Szörnyeink egymást ütik, közben győzelmi pontokat szereznek. Tokyóban lenni előny, ha túl tudsz élni egy kőrt, de nagyon veszélyes. Ilyen körítés kell egy egyszerű mechanizmushoz és máris kellemes játék lesz belőle. Főleg gyerekeknek ajánlott, de felnőttekkel is mókás. Nagyon erős hatos.

Very simple filler dice game, with a solid theme and great implementation. I wish that more powers got into player hands as it is fun to 'roid out your monster and use fun abilities.  Tempted to say one more card in the draw pile and all cards cost one fewer cube.  Even still these cards elevate this from the same old roll dice three times game and turn it into a raucous filler.

Still though, it is great fun.

I haven't given this game a fair shake yet, only one two player game with my 8 y.o. However, this seems like it could be a fun time with about four or so where it matters more if you are in or out of Tokyo. Looking forward to some more plays.EDIT: Played two five player and one four player game. Obviously, it's much better. Decisions felt more meaningful and the decision to stay in Tokyo is much greater (unless you have the Jets card - that's and awesome rule-breaker but it wasn't enough to win the game when it came out). EDIT: I comboed the card Get one of Everything for 9 Points and the card Change any Result to a 1 and scored 18 points on two turns to win the game. Awesomely messed up combo.

I have to say that I was expecting this to be a pretty random dice-fest and while there is certainly a great deal of randomness to it, it is also a heck of a lot of fun. The artwork and short playing time definitely work to it's advantage. You are faced with surprisingly difficult decisions about what dice to try and reroll each turn and whether or not to push your luck and stay in Tokyo. I really enjoy this and hope to play it a bunch between longer games on most game nights in the near future.

A true winner of a push-your-luck style game.  The art is fantastic, the mechanics are simple, and the cards thrown in really make it what it is.

It is fun to play at times, at others I would pass it up.

This is a good lightish game that is a little longer than a filler without being a full blown brain burning game.

You roll dice, you probably don't win or loose, you pass the dice. They roll, they probably don't win or loose. When it comes back you, you roll the dice ... repeat until death. The monsters look nice enough. The main board is ... pointless. The player boards are not good, the numbers need to be much bigger, sure you can read your own board OK, but if you could see the numbers on other players boards, that would be very helpful.

I got this for my friend as a Christmas/birthday gift and we played it at the end of our game night.  Learning the rules and playing a game with 3 took all of 30 minutes tops (and that's with all 3 learning the rules and playing for the first time).  Cutting out the need to read and learn the rules and you can easily get a game played in 20 minutes or less.

Yes, this does mean the game is simple but that doesn't make it mindless.  The rules are short, simple, and easy to learn but there's a good amount of game play and tactical thinking involved.  One of the players even said "this game is pretty simple...yet convoluted in a way" which describes it perfectly.  It's basically played like Yahtzee, you roll 6 dice (that you can re-roll any number of twice) to collect sets of symbols or numbers that attack the other players, heal yourself, collect energy to buy special ability cards, or get victory points.  The real meat of the game is in the tug-of-war and risk/reward battle for Tokyo and the special ability cards.

It's a pretty good game to play to fill 20-30 minutes and there are some decent decisions to be made in which special ability cards to purchase and when to leave Tokyo but there's not much more to it than that besides a themed version of Yahtzee.

One of the big buzzers at our game store, I find it only decently entertaining, some silly fun but it has a few icks that stop it from being the blast of fun everyone claims it is.
The monsters are great, the dice part is very Yahtzee like but that is ok. This game is luck based, the strategic decision of which dice to keep is mostly made by the game for you after all (when you need life points, you have to go for hearts etc.) 
What I disliked is that when you roll an attack on the third roll, you attack whoever is in Tokyo no matter if that is a good choice for you. Death in games is always a bit annoying since you only watch the rest of the game and who likes that. In co-ops the death might contribute to the group, here it only ends the game for you, a bit sad.
A good game to end the night on, I would play it if asked but not seek it out.

You roll dice, pick what symbols you want to keep depending on the situation, and then re-roll the rest to hopefully get what you want. There is some strategy involved but also quite a bit of luck. It's like Yahtzee but less abstract and with a little more excitement. The rules are super simple and easy to explain to anyone. Ridiculously easy to open the box and be playing within 5 minutes, even with inexperienced players. Great fun for everyone including families and non-gamers. 10/10 for simplicity and replayability. 8/10 for simplicity (if you like things a little more complex) and luck factor. Always fun, though. Buy it.

RATING: 8.1
Really fun game that my group and myself enjoy very much. We play it almost every time we meet for game night at least once or twice. 

I changed the rule of rolling for points that you need to have 4 of the same number to get the victory points. This was suggested here at BGG as a variation. If you roll let´s say four "3" you get 3 victory points. If you roll five "3", you get 3+1=4 victory points.

This houserule works well for us, since it encourages people to roll for damage/healing/energy more than just for points. Which is a type of KoT play that we all enjoy the most. More fighting, more buying powercards and everyone wants to get to Tokyo to get victory points or deal damage to the other monsters.

This kaiju fighting game allows you to play as a giant cyborg cat fighting an enormous penguin with freeze ray guns.  Is there more information I can give to sell this?  Yes, actually - it's well designed along with its kickass, over-the-top theme.  Richard Garfield of Magic: The Gathering and Android: Netrunner fame does a brilliant job here of keeping players constantly shifting between a lust for power and a healthy fear of being ganged up on by their bloodthirsty opponents.  Don't stay in Tokyo too long, kids!

OK, just played this again during New Year's Eve with the in-laws and this game was a HUGE hit. Really good game to play for people who are not gamers but want to play something other than Codenames. Has enough strategy (or the perception of strategy) while still being thematically fun and accessible rules-wise. 

I still think the Power Up! expansion detracts from the magic of the base game. Even more swingy and potentially frustrating for an already swingy and crazy game.

Fairly decent dice game. I only played once, with two players and it seems the game might profit from another player or two. Having said that, it's a pretty standard Yahtzee-spin off with added chrome in the action cards. Would like to play again, but don't see any reason yet to prefer this to Pickomino or Roll through the Ages.

Very good dice rolling game.  It should appeal to both gamers and nongamers.  Manages the difficult task of marrying the theme with the mechanics very very well.  I cottoned onto this game early and I'm glad to see that it has raised in the rankings.  It is really very good.  It is a sort of superb family game, that is both readily accessible, appeals to all ages and yet is very good.

The only people who it would not appeal to are people who think board games should not be fun.

A wonderfully over-produced, crazily chaotic, dice-rolling game with unnecessarily yet gratifyingly huge, splashy components.  It's fun.  It's not amazing, and you could probably give me any game with awesome dice and I'd likely enjoy just rolling dem bones, but it moves along at a good clip and provides decent entertainment value for what it is.  What it really needs, though, is a differentiation of the monster characters that is reportedly provided with the expansion.  The theme and artwork don't hold a lot of appeal for me, personally, but it works for a light bash-up like King of Tokyo.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

RATING: 6
Cute Yahtzee-ish filler where each player controls a monster ravaging Tokyo: dice either gain you points, collect energy (to purchase and activate cards with game-breaking engine abilities) or do damage. If you do damage and you're in Tokyo, you hurt everyone; otherwise, you hurt whoever [i]is[/i] in Tokyo, and if they choose to retreat you take over.

Great art contributes to a filler that's great for what it is, but the lack of balance and strong luck level are only forgivable at filler length; play-time is uneven and the game can wear out its welcome if players take too long to die. In my experience, if you ever start to pray for death during a game, it's not a good sign.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's amazing how much fun it is considering a typical game lasts only 15-20 min. It may seem silly reading the rules, but the power cards add the right amount of planning without making it fiddly. Really looking forward to the expansion (Hey IELLO, cardboard monsters are cool and all, but we want DOLLS!).

RATING: 7.9
Of the games I own, there is no game that is more popular. It is easy to learn, and almost anyone I play with loves the game. While I do enjoy this game, a lot of people who learn to play this game ONLY want to play this game. If they get tired of playing it they are usually not open to learning new board games. As a result, while the game does a great job capturing the attention of non-gamers, I don't recommend this game to be their first. I find that the friends I introduce other gateway-to-board-games type games (e.g. Takenoko, Love Letter) first will not be as clingy with King of Tokyo. I find this to be interesting. Perhaps this is telling of some of the friends I have and how addicting this game can get. If I'm hosting a game night and they are demanding KoT every time, I will simply tell them to buy their own copy and host their own game night. If anyone invites me to their place and plays KoT I will more than happily play and enjoy. But if I want to avoid losing my sanity playing KoT every night of my life, I will keep it out of my rotation when I host.

After a few plays in larger group, a few in two players I may say what I think: This is stupid, random game. All is based on luck. Nonetheless, quite playable, but only to the limits of being tired with limited control over the game. You may take a few strategies here: Roll for victory points (a bit too strong ability), roll for energy and buy more special cards (good thing but too many cards with crappy skills dissolve the deck to a point of being almost useless) or roll for damage – but most of the wounds could be healed within a turn so what’s the point? If cards would be more important a maybe a pip cheaper, playing for cards and building some strategies on them may be more useful. If victory points would be a bit harder to obtain, more would play for cards etc. The game feels balanced but not necessarily in a perfect direction.

Two players game sucks, game is unplayable. +.5 to the ranking for excellent graphic design and good box with almost perfect inlay. +.5 to the ranking because I can still play it some more, but I think after 5-6 more plays I will trade it away.

This is a great, simple game that doesn't fret about bells or whistles. Amassing points and smashing opponents has been a good time for anyone I've introduced to this game. The mechanical time limit of 20 points keeps it between 30-45 minutes for manageable time, and the 6-player cap is great for keeping play restriction low.

Fun little dice game. The only problem I have with it, is that the special ability cards seem to cost a lot and most people will see only 1 in the entire game. Wish going for them was more of a viable option, or that there was more available. I'm sure it is an easy house rule, but playing as-is it seems a bit weird. Also, some of the cards (Wings) are so powerful that if anyone manages to get them they can easily run away with the game. Besides that though, it is definitely a fun quick dice game that is a good way to start or end a gaming session.

Santa cucaracha! Vaya juego, y mira que lo coges y miras la caja, y la remiras, y dudas si es un juego para niños o no, no te convence. El dependiente de la tienda te dice qeu es alucinate y sigues sin verlo claro, no... mejor no...

y luego vas y juegas, como obligado, como por no hacer el feo a ese colega que no para de hablar de el. En ese momento te conviertes tu en ese colega pesao alucinado de este juego.

El Kingof, es el juego de largo que más amigos se han comprado. eh! y no llega ni a 30€!

Holly cockroach! what a game! You first take a look at it, and then you relook at it. You doubt. Is it a kids game? The shopkeeper insist "it´s a blast!". But not, you don´see it that way.

Then, you go and play it. Not because you like the game but for not being a bad guest at your friend´s. He insist even more than the shopkeeper. At this precise moment you became your friend, now you´re the one that can´t stop talkin´ about "King of"

By far, "King of" is the game that most of my friends have purchased. hey! and it´s even a cheap game!

Simple dice game that does a lot of smart moves. You're never a target unless you agree to be, there's a lot of luck but also a lot of mitigation, and there's an extra deck of special ability cards to drive up the variability.

RATING: 7
Good silly fun. Its light and fast playing, and I like the wide variety of power cards. The combat and point gathering is well done, though scoring is very dependent on lucky rolls.
Downsides: Player elimination, though at least you shouldn't be out too long here. Components aren't great; some of our dials are peeling apart slightly, and the dice, not being etched, aren't going to last.

House rule: In a 5+ player game, a player going into Tokyo Harbor does NOT damage the player already in Tokyo.

Great "Gateway" game. I introduce this to people who don't play games. 5 minute instructional time. Haven't met a single person that dislikes the game. 20-30 minute session play and usually people want to play more than one game! "Essential Game" when starting a collection. Not too much depth.

A quick and fun light game (that's made better by the expansions)... if it is played as a QUICK and fun light game. I've experienced a handful of games where players took a relatively long time deciding on their dice rolls and that sort of play style makes the game incredibly boring. A good game for non-gamers, young gamers, and families alike, but your mileage may vary outside of that.

Fun light game that can fall flat if everybody just focus on getting points. The game is much better if your try to kill each other, and much quicker. 

The huge amounts of cards mean every game will be different. 

Not a lot of decisions to be made, but it's more a push your luck game. Do you stay in Tokyo a bit longer or do you flee? Do you go for energy and cards, or health? Or maybe you want to take control of Tokyo? 

Some card combos can be really over-powered but the game is short enough that it doesn't bother me.

The two expansions (power-up! and Halloween) are great additions to the game so don't hesitate.

There's not a lot to the game, but what is there is done well (essentially, the artwork). 

With more than 4 players it is too long by far and defensive strategies drag the game out even longer.

Having recently played Roll Through The Ages, I can honestly say that is a much better game with a similar mechanic (and the goods in that are more well rounded and allows more tactics) than the energy in KoT.

A Yahtzee game needlessly complicated with arbitrary combat mechanics, but excellent art and theming.

King of Tokyo is perhaps my favorite game of all time.  It is a dice rolling, press your luck game that still has some elements of strategy and decision making to make the game more interesting.  It lasts for a perfect length, perhaps 30mins-90mins so it is not so short it feels unrewarding and not so long that you want it to end.

There is really nothing I would change about the game, while it is a bit on the simpler side, the heavy die rolling and light gameplay makes for a lot of laughs and good times. I have never found someone who disliked the game and never has someone gotten mad or competitive, the game just breeds fun and perhaps for that reason it raises what would be an 8 or 9 game to an easy 10.

I would also recommend checking out the expansion, while the game doesn't need it, it can make the game a little more complex and interesting.

RAWR!  SMASH!  
I was apprehensive at first.  Great looking bits, excellent theme... but it can't be as bad as Monsters Menace America right?  Pleasant surprise, what looked like a random dice fest akin to Yahtzee turned out to be a delightfully playable and amusing little risk taking game.  Theres a little more than just random luck here as it is more highly choice driven than pure die rolls.  Its fast, dirty and proving to be a terrific light filler game.  Highly expandable in the future, I'd like to see a little less player elimination from it down the road, but its fast and amusing enough that sitting out isn't so bad.

Great theme. A certain segment of the population likes this. Dh has a great time with the boys. Personally, any game that could throw you out of the game in the first few turns doesn't strike me as that fun. Very random and can also drag on and on trying to get someone to win.

I really wanted to like this game but I honestly can't see why people love it so much. It can knock some people out early and then drag on with only a couple of players left. Theme feels really pasted on. It has fiddly mechanics and it's easy to forget a variety of upkeep activities. I thought perhaps the kids would like it but even the 9yo and 13yo dislike it and would prefer to play anything else but this.

Quick filler. Basically just dice rolling, but it's over soon enough, art is funny and kids like it. There are small decisions to make like what dice to keep, which card to buy and most importantly; stay in Tokyo or not to stay. What I'm saying, it's not totally pointless as many dice fests. :)

This is a huge success in my family.  My 10 and 11 year old daughters love it and we usually play 2-3 games in a sitting.

Average about 20-30 minutes.

The only reason I don't give this game a 10 is that the cards do not seem to find their way into the game very much so the energy cubes kind of play as a consolation prize to a poor turn at the dice.

Anyone who focuses purely on the Yatzee mechanic of the game seems to win every time.

Fun! It's great with almost any group I've played with.  Very easy rules.  The ONLY negative is player elimination; but that's also part of the fun and, since it's usually me, it allows me to grab the bag of chips and snack for a good 10 minutes.

A dice game with a goofy theme that I didn't think I'd like -- but I do, quite a bit! Don't look for heavy strategy, but there is strategy. You have to know when to push your luck, and when to back off; when to attack, and when to get the heck out of Tokyo. The cards add special powers, but also extra strategy. The game is best played quickly, loudly, and with a group ready to get into the cartoony theme. Although there is player-elimination, the short play-time keeps things moving.

RATING: 8
This game is silly fun, with an enjoyable theme and lots of big dice to roll. It's a bit of a throwback in that it's fairly luck dependent and has player elimination. The high luck factor doesn't bother me because the game is short and goofy. The player elimination bothers me, though. It was interesting to play a game with player elimination after several years of playing games without it. I think it was a mechanism better off left in the past. Still, a pretty fun game.

Not the most strategic game, but it's definitely a lot of fun.  It plays fast and works well with 3 to 6 players.  Everyone I've played it with has wanted to play again.  The power cards are pretty unbalanced, but I don't have a problem with that for this sort of game.  I don't have a desire to buy the game, but it's perfect for playing occasionally at your FLGS.

Update: I'm getting bored with this, especially with more than 4 because of the downtime.  Still good in the right situations, but I will probably never suggest playing it.

I liked this one quite a bit. Even though it's just monster Yahtzee, it retains quite a bit of atmosphere. I like that there's a constant choice between grabbing points and slowing others down with a healthy dose of damage. The decision of whether to stick it out in Tokyo for a full round to pick up points also can be tough. My only quibble with the game is the vanilla monsters, which are identical other than the stand-up silhouette. The energy cards eventually give some monsters different abilities, but starting each one off with some small power to make them unique from the get-go would have added nicely to the flavor. But overall, this is good take-that fun.

Lots of ups and downs in the game as players gain energy, lose their health, etc. Totally get the feel of this King of the Hill game as it's sometimes in your best interest to not be on the hill.

Despite all the bluster, King of Tokyo doesn't offer any meaningful decisions.  The art is comical and the cards are a great idea.

It's all luck. It's all fun. Love that every card in the game is unique. Love how they managed to get that Godzilla-trash-feeling into the game. Love how I lost every single game so far and still had a great (short)time. Loved that even when being eliminated I got to see an epic monster showdown (a final showdown so great it made the Godzilla/Mothra, King Ghidora-showdowns pale in comparison)that was as good as actually playing the game.

Finals result: Loved!

I picked this up at the same time as Quarriors (as a point of reference).  They have some similarities, but mostly they are both super fillers.

Right now, I have to say I love King of Tokyo.  With the cards and the push your luck element, it just feels right.  It doesn't try to do too much, and what it does, it does so well.  

UPDATE:

This is one of the best games of 2011, and one of the best fillers I have ever played.  It is super quick, a breeze to teach, and has tremendous hooks.  The cards are what tend to make the game click, as they offer all manner of whacked-out powers, ways to bend almost break the game.  For under $30, it is an absolute steal.  The dice are printed, card stock is so-so, and the stand-ups are kind of forgettable.  But you play this game because it is fun, not because you are proud of the way it looks.  It is shallow, true, but man is it fun.

I mean... it's a kids game. That's really the defining feature. It has a card deck, kaiju is a really fun concept, it has a lot of adult fans... there were reasons I thought it would be more... it's a kids game. It's actively too simple to be enjoyable as an adult. Think Chutes and Ladders or Candy Land... It may be a little deeper, but not enough. Don't bother if you don't have kids... even if you do... see if they can handle something that'll stimulate you more... Imhotep or Evolution or something.

A dice-driven combat game for 2-5 players. Game is simple to learn and plays extremely fast. Theme consists of various monsters duking it out for control of Tokyo. Most games seem to last only 15-30 minutes. Definitely falls into the filler game category, as there isn't a terrible amount of strategic depth to the game. I don't typically enjoy games which are quite this reliant on luck (dice-driven), so I'm not always in the mood to play. I find the game can be fun when used as a warm-up game, a break from games of other types, or when used as a gateway game to introduce others into the hobby of board gaming.

Can be a lot of fun, but has some issues. Depending on the cards that people get and the amount of healing that each player does, this game can drag for far too long.

People also tend to understate the player elimination in this game. Unlike something like Love Letter where a round is so quick that player elimination isn't a problem, in KoT you can get eliminated early and have to wait 30-45 minutes for a game to finish. That's never fun.

It's like a game that focuses on the very end of Monsters Menace America, which is awesome.  But, we just rolled claws like CRAZY until everyone died.  Played twice though!

I liked the basic idea, but it felt like the main RAWWWWWWWWWWWWWR moments were dulled by the idea that you should NEVER stay in Tokyo if you can help it.  Seemed counter-intuitive and unsatisfying!  Once one player dies, the chain reaction of death is quick and brutal.  I need to be more drunk to play this

Good, quick, dice chucker with an endearing theme. I'll probably keep it around to fill that gap in my collection. Its biggest value is that it can be played by young and old. 

I use a variant I created called [thread=821635][/thread]. It doubles the number of energy cubes you get from an energy roll, essentially getting more cards into play much quicker. This makes the game much more interesting and different every time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I find this game very addictive (about 15 plays so far).

I love dice, I love the theme, I love the light confrontation.  Why isn't this a 9?

It isn't a 9 because of the player elimination.  You can play for 10 minutes then sit out for 20 minutes watching others play. The consequences of risky play are not just losing a game (no problem), but sitting around watching others play for too long (problem).  

A dice rolling game should not discourage high risk play so much.

I have also come to the realization that if this had a theme that was even a bit less fun or art and components that were even a bit less engaging this game would not get nearly the play for me that it does.  This stuff matters a lot more with light games.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 2

This game hit the table when my parents came into town (they are 64) and when I went to hang out with my gaming buddies (they are late 20s). Each group we played with had a lot of fun and there were even some really interesting strategies at the end of each game. Great family game, but not so much that it can't hit a gamer-table.

RATING: 9
This has quickly become my favorite filler game, by a lot. King of Tokyo is simple, fast and very engaging. It has a bit of depth but not so much that analytical players will slow things down trying to do fuzzy math. The campy theme makes the game accessible to a broad demographic and welcome at most gatherings (even in groups that typically only enjoy "party" games). My daughter also loves this game (current age 6), making it a family favorite.

Another one of those games that I would qualify as simple and good to get people into playing games. The nice thing about playing this game is that once you've played it a couple of times you realize that you can come-up with a number of different strategies for it and different ways to play it. It's a nice fast game as well which makes it good as a warm-up game before you jump into something more serious.

The 1st time I played it was with 5 people. Whoever got into Tokyo just hammered everyone and killed the other 3 people on the 2nd or 3rd turn. ...in both games.

How fun was that?

Instead of collecting energy or VP, you can just slam on each other while all but 2 people just watch angrily.

However, I played 2-player and 3-player and had a great time playing the game. I'm guessing the 4-player game would also be great.

Ameri"trash" at its best!

Well this is a fun and refreshing game! Great components, great and super silly story/narrative, great replayability, excellent flow of play and several decisions along the way. In addition, it plays extremelly fast! I never thought I'd have so much fun ravanging Tokyo with a pink cyber-bunny!

Of course the game has lots of luck and chaos in it, but never to the point that it becomes annoying.

All in all, king of Tokyo is an excellent AT filler with a ridiculusly extravagant fantasy theme. Unfortunatelly, this is a category that I really dislike.

RATING: 2
In the late '00s, there was a wave of criticism of the then current crop of Eurogames as being JASE (just another soulless euro).  There was definitely some truth to this, as many euro designs were heading down the path of jumbling together a bunch of cube pushing mechanisms that worked well but lacked theme or immersion or the ephemeral "fun."

Well, the pendulum has now swung completely in the opposite direction with King of Tokyo.  Monsters!  Yay!  It has theme!  But ... it is basically Yahtzee with 95% or more of the decisions removed.  So what has been created here is not the themeless game, but the gameless theme.  Once you get over the fact that it has monsters battling in Tokyo (which surprisingly few seem to be able to look past) you find ... nothing.  There is no real game here.  I'm completely baffled that it gets so much love.  No real decisions at all, the always intriguing prospect of getting eliminated so you can watch two others roll dice at each other for 15 minutes, and did I mention no decisions?  If you're really in the mood for something this pointless and mindless, why not just turn off your brain entirely and watch some reality tv?  Just to keep your games played log numbers up?

But ... it has monster!  Yay!  So I'll bump it up from a 1 rating to a 2.

A very simple yet exciting and fun game. Extremely easy to teach and play. There are some tactics, I guess you could say, but mainly it's just a game about tension and fun. This one is an absolute masterpiece in the eyes of young boys, but it definitely works with almost everyone. Note though, that it's not really fun with only two players, even with the pretty decent variants out there. Some of the cards are abit unclear in their wording as to how exactly they function, but that is very limited.

RATING: 10
Love this game, really easy to explain and then you're straight into it.  The cards are cool, the dice are cool and it plays really quick, shame there are no miniatures for the monsters but the cardboard cut outs have good artwork.  I do really love the art style for everything in this game, really attracted me to it.  It's just really fun yet really simple to pick up.  

I'm really impressed by how much fun it is, it a really good fun game.

King of Tokyo é um jogo rápido e divertido, uma excelente opção para iniciar pessoas no mundo dos boards e cardgames. Não há grande dependência de idioma (pouco texto nas cartas utilizadas). O jogador traça sua estratégia através da rolagem de dados e escolha dos resultados obtidos. Uma característica ruim do KoT é a eliminação de jogadores, fazendo com que a pessoa que foi eliminada tenha que aguardar o início de outra partida para poder jogar novamente.

RATING: 7
A really fun game! Roll the dice, do some damage, or try for points. Could this be the time to heal or to bash? Keep the two 1 or the one 3 and go for it? King of Tokyo isn't the a heavy-decision game. It's dice fun with big cardboard monster clomping each other to be the most famous (or the last standing) monster.

Not everyone that played, liked it. KoT has its quirks (luck being a thing not everyone if fond of), and won't be a winner all-around. Still, it works in several situations and with people that like to chuck dice.

Yahtzee style mechanic with the dice is great fun. Can lead to crazy push-your-luck moments like going for the 6 hits roll... And getting it (dammit Brian).

A good romp through Tokyo. Although there are a ton of cards in the game that provide extra powers, they feel expensive (because it requires the green cubes, which themselves require a specific die roll) and therefore don't get played much. Most games are won by attacks and surviving in Tokyo.

Power up expansion is a must - Love the Evolutions

With 3-5 people it is wonderful and one of those games everyone should own - More ppl is more fun

Perfect filler and just plain fun - every time my friends and I meet, someone wants to pull it out and play a game

Played with Halloween Expansion and was great - wish the monsters not in that expansion got the pass around evolutions, though - seems it almost makes the Halloween monsters too powerful - will see after more plays (even with them, a 'normal' monster still won)

We play A LOT - group loves it but it is beginning to get a bit ho hum for me - rating down a bit though still fun

---------------------

After more plays I feel the Halloween expansion is a bit flat - the costumes are kinda wonky, etc....adds a bit too much to the game and tries to be more then what it is (kind of like the 7-Wonders Leaders Expansion)  Will most likely leave this out on future plays

great fun, with a wide range of age group appeal.  It's a good game with some beer n chips, and you get to chuck around dice!

Dice are kinda too big for me personally ( but my daughter loves the chunkiness, and I guess they are bright and visibile for everyone at a party table)

Artwork is bright and appealing, although hit n miss.  Some of the characters are great, the board fire and explosions are a bit janky :S  All the card artwork is probably the best.

This game has some fun randomness and there are enough tactics to try to keep you interested throughout a game.

Good game to own for a wide range of occasions - from grown up game nights where no-one wants to play anything super heavy, and for kids and family fun!

I can remove the foamcore and send everything in their original packaging separately, but would rather send as is listed.

Love my dice; love this game.  GREAT fun with the right group.  Slightly less great with a "not right" group.  So, a winner.  

I now want more power cards.  Also:  starting monster powers - different monsters really should be different to play.  Extra also:  player elimination can be harsh if it happens too early.  Yes its a quick game, but it would be nice to have a house rule to let players come back in with a new monster/less hearts/no points.  will have to research this one - there must be a variant here somewhere.

Also:  my dice SUCK.  chipping quite bad.  REALLY disappointed that the second edition rumoured to have engraved dice and i won't get them...

King of Tokyo features an over the top flavor, smash 'em up game play, and light strategy.  The dice are oversize, and the standee monsters actually fit the game better than any well molded resin figures could.  This is the perfect game for some drunk gaming.  Here is a classic example of a game design shooting low and hitting the target well, making it a nice one to own to round out your collection.

RATING: 7.5
Good:
-A ton of interaction
-Family game
-Strategy helps a lot but good rolls trump strategy
-Interesting decisions throughout
-Power cards make the game more interesting

Bad:
-Power cards confuse non-gamers
-Some power cards are open to interpretation
-Some power cards seem too powerful (Wings & Jets)

Overall:
I'd recommend this game for any gaming group but think it's a stretch to call this a gateway game.  It will go well with just about anyone open to board games.

A fun party game. This is a perfect example where theme makes the game. There's some strategy but at the end of the day you're just rolling a lot of dice. Still can be a blast, though.

RATING: 8
Fun filler with sci-fi monsters, special dice and power cards. With attractive artwork and an appealing theme. However, I do need to be in the mood for a game with such randomness (lots and lots of dice rolling). And when played with more than 4 players, it is possible that it outstays its welcome in terms of playing time. Also, there is always a good chance that some players will be eliminated halfway through the game, so make sure that it is played with people who do not mind that too much. All in all, I think that there is too much hype surrounding this game. It is fun with a fantastic theme, but I would rather play Diamant/Incan Gold if I am in the mood for a pretty random risk taking game with a large group. Mainly because it has less downtime. Still, King Of Tokyo is very fun with the right group (like for example my teenage son :-)).
UPDATE: The more I play this game, the more I like it! I see now how you can guesstimate your chance of survival by assessing the intentions and the playstyle of the next players in line, making sure to leave (or enter!) Tokyo in time. Simple game, good fun.

RATING: 7
A dice game at heart, players roll for victory points to win the game or eliminate enough opponents to become king of the hill. I did not find any earth-shattering novelty for this game and honestly, just a simple design that works. The game plays relatively quick and will likely work well with younger players. Since this is a dice game, loads of luck everywhere throughout the game. There really is not a whole lot of decision making.

This game also plays poorly with two.

022213: Plays a lot better with five. Much better. After several more plays with 5 players, this game's ranking rises a point. I look forward to playing with different groups since it is very light, fast and actually, the game play is quite tight. Sure, there is player elimination, but the variety from the card power makes it fun.

This is a fun and light game.  My 6 year old and I love playing it, although it seems at times in a 2 player game, you don't get through as many cards as you'd like to make it more exciting.  As such, we have halved (and rounded up) the cost of cards to impact that.

5 player games seem the most fun!  I say light though as it is very much Yahtzee-esque and adults may not be in for the longhaul of playing this regularly.  That said, it's a great filler game.

Initially rated this an 8, but with repeated plays I'm beginning to see the validity in criticisms by those who dislike it.  Currently grading it a 7 and it might gown to a 6 with future plays.  Gameplay can be very uneven and highly depends on what cards come out for purchase as well as just plain luck.  Rating might go up after playing expansion, but we'll see.

A fun, light, dice-fest filler game. Unless you're getting this for kids however, immediately buy the 'Power Up!' expansion which gives each of the monsters their own abilities. 
Wonderful components - I even like the chunky cardboard standees. Large, colourful, pre-paint figures would be wonderful, but I can certainly see why they wouldn't want to add them to the base game. Perhaps an awesome set of vinyl pop-culture figures? Now THAT would be sweet!

This game requires special mental state so to say, some silliness floating over the group of players, kinda very loose atmosphere, otherwise it's... meh. But it won't generate it by itself. 

You tend to laugh out of nothing with your group? This game is for you? Otherwise at least try it out before buying.

This is probably super hypocritical, seeing that I rate other random games like Isla Dorada an 8.5, but I get the sense that there's a bit too little to control here (like Bang!, your fate is way too determined by others' random luck).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
The first player to reach 20 victory points is the winner, or you can kill everyone else. Everyone has 10 life points at the start.
The gameplay is very simple, you just roll dice in a "Yatzi" mechanism and try to do damage to your opponents and avoid damage yourself. You can also roll victory points or flash symbols with which you can buy cards with instant effects or assets to "improve" your rolls. Or you can roll hearts to heal you.
The first player to reach 20 victory points is the winner, or you can kill everyone else.
The first player to roll an attack symbol goes to tokyo (you always get victory points when you're in tokyo and additional points if you're still in there when it is your turn again.)
The guy in tokyo now attacks every other player whereas every other player attacks the guy in tokyo. And the big problem of tokyo is that you cannot heal yourself there. Always when you take damage in tokyo, you can decide whether to stay or leave. If you leave, the player damaging you that round goes to tokyo and you are attacking him then etc.
The "gambling" aspect when you're in Tokyo becomes more intriguing when you are playing with more than 4 players.
It plays very quickly so there's a good thing to this but overall it's not my favourite game since it becomes quite boring after a while.

There's something satisfying about the way this game progresses, from basic monsters with no special skills who clash together a few times with limited results, then bulk up to be specialized and deadly fighting machines. It feels like it's a Japanese monster movie in progress. It has a great blend of chance and strategy, and downtime between turns is still interesting once you get past the first play or two.

Fun monster themed dice game.  Somewhat similar to Yahtzee, but the cards and the king of the hill aspect add a lot more interaction.  The theme is fun and the components are nice (though I would have preferred engraved dice rather than stickers).  Secret Santa gift from 2011.

Edit: got the engraved dice.  Also, we have started playing with a variant where in a two player game you don't gain a vp for entering Tokyo and you only get 1 for starting your turn there.  These two simple changes make the two player game much much better!

Fun game, especially for kids, where everyone is a monster, and you play "King of the Hill" by seeing who can stay in Tokyo the longest. If you are in Tokyo you make the most points, but you take the most damage, as everyone else is attacking you. Clever game with a great theme, and very fun. 

Note: the new King of New York has recently been released and the reviews say that it's better than King of Tokyo unless you also buy the two expansion card sets for King of Tokyo. If you're going to get all the expansions get this one; King of New York is a much better deal for just the stand-alone game, though.

I really like King of Tokyo. I would say that my rating might be a bit inflated and would likely go down if I started playing it more.

KoT is a very basic game that uses a mechanic that most people are already familiar with. This the the Yahtzee choose your dice and roll up to 3 times. Except KoT adds in Monsters that are trying to control the city of Tokyo and crush other monsters. There are a lot of good things about KoT like you don't specifically attack any other monster (thus p*ssing them off) while in tokyo and instead attack them all. There are a couple different ways to victory for people who like to play different ways. The strength in this game is how light and fun it is. I think both of the expansions bog this game down, make it last too long and I would not recommend either one.

KoT is great fun. If you think about it as a light game that can start off the night, you can't go wrong.

There's really not a whole lot to this game, but looks can be deceiving, there's a definite genius to the universal appeal of King of Tokyo.

I play this nearly every week.  If I ever have new gamers, it's the first game I grab, everyone enjoys themselves, everyone praises the game the whole time and begs to play more.

Just light, simple, interactive fun.

UPDATE: After over 20 plays, the game has fallen off quite a bit.  It still can be a great game at the right time with the right group, but not a ton of game there.

I just don't get this game. Whenever I go into Tokyo I get slammed by attacks to make me retreat, and then my opponent will go in and be fine for 2 full rounds. Then I'll roll one attack on my last roll and they'll let me into Tokyo (I can't refuse) so the next player can finish me off. Then I get to wait anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes (that's how variable the play time is) - yay player elimination.

Not that much here, but somewhat forgivable as a short game.  Better as a game for ~4 players, which is disappointing as the theme makes it seem like it wants 6+.  Much of the strategy here is about trying to identify the groupthink and exploit it.  Decisions are almost entirely tactical.  Use of the Yahtzee mechanic of saving dice between rolls is well-utilized, if not particularly innovative.  All in all, this is a forgettable game with a great theme.  If this wasn't a cool and underutilized theme, nobody would be looking twice at this.

After a couple games I was a bit disappointed. It seemed like going to Tokyo made no sense at all since everyone would just beat you. But that was because everyone was rolling for attacks dice, we thought everything else was useless because 20 points seemed so far... But if everyone is aggressive then it's better to just roll for points and avoid attacking at all! But as more people start to roll for points then you're better of in Tokyo because nobody attacks you anyway!

I like how you need to adapt your strategy to the state of the game. There is much more depth than one might think.

It is the usual Yathzee variant, with some special powers to add spice and occasionally targeted attacks to create interaction.
Light and random; a decent mindless filler (maybe a bit too long for what it is ...and early player elimination is a possibility).

Very quick to learn and fast to play Yahtzee-like family game. I think this would be ideal with 3+ players, so there's more strategy with attacks and yielding. With 2, there's not much of that.

Richard Garfield, a Magic és a CCG nagy öregjének újabb alkotása egy erősen tematizált kockapóker - amiben hatalmas szörnyként romboljuk le Tokyo-t és a többi játékos nem különben vérszomjas szörnyeit. Két játékossal nem az igazi, viszont hattal is igen pörgős, így ideális party játék.

RATING: 5
Rated after four games. The game has a simple idea and mechanics. I kind of liked it, but it didn't really hit me. Quite light and random, a Yahtzee variant. The game is easy to learn, so it is good for new gamers.

Works quite well with four players, but even then there's lots of downtime. With more players even more. Includes player elimination and lots of luck, not much of choices to make.

Updated after fifth play, dropped the rating to 4. We had four players and I just felt bored.

5th play felt better than what I expected, there were 5 players now. There was lots of hitting, so it was not that boring. And it only lasted 20 minutes, when the winner killed others during the same turn. Updated the rating from 4 to 5.

If you like dice games and you like player interaction this is what you are looking for. Simple to learn and always fun to play (even if you get eliminated).

Don't let any rules ambiguities from card interactions or the dice deter you, if you want fun, this game delivers!
--------------------------------------------------------
Having tried King of New York I still prefer King of Tokyo for its simplicity and tension. With the Power Up Expansion you can have an additional layer of choices and depth, but it also encourages healing which can sometimes spiral the game beyond its prime length.

Still enjoyable after many many plays!

This cemented the fact that I don't like player elimination in my board games (hadn't really thought of it until playing KoT for the first time).  I like the other elements of the game however this part just bothers me after a friend was eliminated almost right away.  I replaced with Run, Fight or Die which allows for dice rolling and matching, without anyone sitting out.

I was expecting this game to be a light dice-fest with a funny theme, and I wasn't disappointed; it's basically another board game based on the Yahtzee rules.  I was actually surprised to find that the game has a pretty decent system, to boot.  I like the balance between hitting the gruesomes who aren't in Tokyo, and the gruesome in Tokyo hitting the other gruesomes.  I'm not wild about the player elimination aspect of the game, but it played pretty quickly, and I found myself rooting for mayhem after I was wiped out early in the game.  I'd definitely play it again.

The first "designer" board game (not named Catan) that I owned.  Still a lot of fun if I want something light that can accommodate a lot of players (6).

RATING: 6
It never feels particularly exciting. 

The cards seem like a lumpy afterthought- either irrelevant or so OP that the game is a race for a single purchase, won by luck. 

Lots of bash the leader, but then if everybody _doesn't_ bash the leader, they run away quite quickly.

Has also not been a huge hit with less-nerdy friends and family, which seems like the one job this game had.

I don't hate playing it, but it only really comes out when everyone is far too tired to play a proper game. And even then, I'd rather be playing Skulls or Crossing or something like that.

King of Tokyo is just about the perfect game to cap off a game night. It's fast, easy to teach and has just enough player interaction to allow for some smack talk without leaving too many hard feelings when it's over. The scoring mechanism is a little odd, scoring points for matching numbers seems out of place in a game about giant rampaging monsters. The precedent set by the cards makes me think those numbers represent your monster smashing through valuable real estate, but the rules and components do nothing to verify that idea. I'm sure simplicity and ease of use were the motivating factors behind using those numbers, so I don't really consider them to be a flaw...It's just something that stands out as very non-thematic when I teach it.

I liked this game a lot more than I expected to; I don't generally like dice games, but this was pretty fun. The biggest problem I had was that, like many dice games, it doesn't always know when to end; if I could guarantee the game wouldn't go any longer than about 20 minutes, I'd probably be happier with it as a filler, but it could go on quite a while, and maybe more importantly quite a while after 4 people have been eliminated from the game.

My youngest (5) is lost in this game except that he has a monster and he can choose to be king.  My daughter (8) likes the decision making and has quickly caught on.  They both like spiffing up and modding their monsters.  It's a dice game, but manages a good balance between what you get and what you want.  And of course there is the existential question of to be King of Tokyo, or not to be King of Tokyo.  It's fun to be king, but can you take the heat?

I'd had my eye on this game since the first pictures on BGG because of the fantastically cute art.  Having now played it, it looks even better in person.  Among my very favorite game art ever.

The game itself is a lot silly fun.  Lots of cool special abilities that allow you to customize your monster and provide a ton of variability.

The King-of-the-Hill mechanic works great--being King gets you victory points, but also puts a big red X on you and takes away your ability to heal.  The possibility of accidentally winding up King is unique and leads to some pretty funny situations.

The central Yahtzee-style rolling mechanic works just fine, like it does elsewhere.  It feels a bit more random here than in some other games (like Roll Through the Ages or Pickomino) since you are often hoping for just one specific side to come up, and when it doesn't you often can't do anything with a bunch of your dice.  That's ok though, because it's hard to take the game too seriously.  Sometimes you get the crap beat out of you and sometimes you beat the crap out of everyone else, but either way you're hooting and hollering and having a good time.

Yahtzee meets King of the Hill with a splash of MtG.  Well somewhere in the middle there's this game by RG.  It's good dice rolling fun and all about knowing when to step off the mound and lick your wounds or whether to push your luck and roll the dice for a more strategic result you may be trying to achieve.  It's light fun and plays up to 6 without overstaying its welcome.

My girlfriend and her family love to play basic games like Jenga, Taboo, and Dominos. Having played with them, I wanted to bring something different to the table. Based of reviews, I knew I wanted this game the moment I saw it, but convincing my girlfriend and her family was my main goal. When they first saw the box, they all laughed and joked around saying that this looked like a little kids game. They soon found out that they could have tons of fun playing this "kids" game. My girlfriend's father(who is supposedly good at games and was telling everyone he was going to win prior to playing) lost in the first 5 minutes which was hilarious. At the end of the day, everyone loved it and we played it multiple times for over 6 hours. This is a wonderful game to start building my board game collection.

It's rolling dice, which is meh. The only real strategy is when to go into Tokyo, but it does help that being in Tokyo is helping you in a vast number of ways. 

Cautious players will kill this game though. A quick game definitely is a good game.

A really fun version of Yahtzee.  There aren't many games that you don't care whether you win or lose - this is one of them.  The satisfaction of getting a new power, or knocking someone out of Tokyo - those are victories!

9 by itself. 10 with Power Up expansion. One of the easiet games to teach others, but also a game that is always requested. Extremely light weight, but addictive and fun. It's not my favorite game, but its easily my most played game, because it's great filler for hardcore players and a great gateway for new players. I've played it at weddings with the elderly and at my FLGS between games as an amuse bouche

RATING: 8.13
the best Yahtzee style game ever. The first game I played everyone died (we were too greedy staying in and attacking) after which my brother just said I don't even think its possible to win the game with victory points, because we weren't even close. The very next game was over in 5 minutes with a victory point victory. More balanced than it seems because games can go wildly one direction one game and the complete opposite the next.

As I was growing up, Yahtzee was probably the most common family game we played. Mom would play. Dad would play. Even my little brother, while he was too young to read, could play Yahtzee and have a good time. As a result of all that tossing of dice in a plastic cup, the core mechanism of the game imprinted on my brain. There's some sort of primal joy that I get from the "roll, keep, roll" action of the game.

Also deeply imprinted on my brain throughout my more impressionable years is a youth of Sunday afternoons watching television matinees of Godzilla films. Guys in rubber suits battling other guys in rubber suits and cities being reduced to rubble.

King of Tokyo successfully mashes up those two core memories for me. You're throwing dice in a Yahtzee-fashion but instead of just adding up points, your dice are your monster, fighting or powering-up or trying to lick his wounds. And the added king-of-the-hill element makes for a great push-your-luck experience.

You monster can sprout poison quills, or spit acid, or have stretchy limbs and it all makes for silly-good fun. And just as my little brother played Yahtzee with us, I was able to introduce this game to my own kids who immediately latched onto it. And that was a pretty proud moment for me.

Richard Garfield's latest is certainly fun. Quite the dicefest but you can't deny the game has charm. This is a great filler.

Uses the yahtzee mechanic for dice rolling which is fine, I think what irks me about this game is the fact that it's so hard to purchase the cards sometimes. Yet the cards are the coolest thing in the game to me, so when they're just sitting there staring at everyone and no one can afford any it just becomes really annoying.

This is a pretty simple game to learn and understand and lots of fun.  It's 100% dice but you get 3 re-rolls each turn so you don't really feel like you got screwed on one bad roll.  Great fun.

UPDATE-Not a big fan with 2-3 people.  I've had the most fun with 5-6.

I've come to realize that I don't like the game once people start getting eliminated.  Then it becomes 3-4 people watching 2-3 people play and we are all just trying to end the game so everyone can play again.

Of all the dice-rolling monster-in-Tokyo games where you get to rampage and fight your fellow players in an epic battle, this one is definitely the best.  Exquisite and sublime gameplay.

RATING: 7
I looked forward to getting this game after seeing it on TableTop. I knew my son would love it because of the theme and the dice-rolling mechanic. But something about it just didn't push all our buttons. It's fun, but it's not THAT fun. This is possibly because we've played 2-player mostly, and only once 4-player. The 2-player games devolved into someone camping in Tokyo, scoring 2 points each turn, and hoping the other guy wouldn't roll too many claws. If they didn't, you'd just tough it out and win. The power-up cards are a good addition, but they didn't seem as good as they could be.

Overall, like I said - it's fun, and it's a solid purchase. But it's not one we're going to play the majority of the time.

Kids and newcomers love this game and ask for it every time. For me, I always have fun, but never find myself ever really looking forward to playing it. It's heavily reliant on dice rolls, though you can mitigate that luck with your decisions. As long as you understand that, and don't take it too seriously, you'll have fun.

Yahtzee meets Godzilla. Best game for those evenings where you need to roll dice and take names. If people want more complex they can buy the power cards with energy, but you can still will by just smacking others around or just rolling numbers. Just remember you cannot heal with dice in Toyko (just like in real life).

This game is super fun and fast. If there was any qualm I have, it's that just as I start to get my cards in tow, the game ends. I would like to see the cards used more. The game as a 2-player game, although very slightly amusing, greatly lacks the spark and frenzy that come with more players. Certainly a 3+ player game without question.

This is definitely a game I feel would be advantageous to own because it is accessible to so many ages, larger groups and it can be fit into nearly any time-frame at all.

This game is what Yahtzee should be if Yahtzee were a good game and had any theme.  Roll 6 dice and have up to 2 rerolls. Can try to attack other players to take control of Tokyo (which gives points every turn), gain energy (money) to buy cards with special abilities, heal your wounds, or gain points.

Game plays incredibly fast and there is actually some strategy for what dice you choose to reroll each turn. I usually hate games that revolve around luck of rolling dice, but this was not bad at all. I could see this getting very boring after a while, though, since at the end of the day, you're still just rolling dice.

RATING: 7.8
The best gateway game I have tried, due to it being fast paced and pretty simple and with a fun theme.  Not much thinking though so more for those who (sometimes) like a game that is light on the brain cells.

This is a lightweight dice game with maximum player interaction.  The object is simple:  be the first to score 20 victory points, or be the last player standing.  Last monster standing, actually.  Each player assumes the role of a monster invading Tokyo.  The game is easy enough to teach to even non-gamers in a few minutes, and yet there are various strategies that must be employed in order to win.  The game is fast and fun.  The artwork on the cards is very well done and adds to the enjoyment.  The theme is totally integrated into the gameplay.  It's a light filler for gaming groups, but also appropriate to bring out with non-gaming groups.

I was unexpectedly impressed with the "damage many others" mechanic: Those monsters inside Tokyo damage those on the outside, and vice versa.  And if you want to flame out and take 2-3 other inhumanoids with you - knowing that you won't last another round - you can.  That's a thing of beauty.

This would be an instant purchase at $15-20.  But it's a "nevermind" at whatever exorbitant price they're charging.

The Ameritrash Yahtzee. Short enough that the player elimination isn't a big deal. Downtime is reduced by having monsters in Tokyo deal damage to everyone outside, keeping all players interested in others' dice rolls. The special powers give life to the game, but there really needs to be more (something!) to differentiate between monsters. I understand the expansion is addressing this. Quite good.

A fun yahtzee type game. Rules can be taught in couple minutes and the theme generally goes over great with everyone.

My big gripes with this one are the player elimination (at higher player counts this can really hurt) and the fact that if you've got any luck with the dice, you can just roll for VP and generally pull off a win.

All the same, with new players who don't know this fact yet, the game is great! Just not one I'd bring to a table of highly experienced (and competitive) gamers.

King of Tokyo is a great relaxing game. Both the theme & mechanics are great. However I find they're rather dissonant. Rolling dice doesn't feel particularly monstrous to me.

Not overly complicated so it's easy to teach.  Everyone that's played it with me has had fun and wanted to play again.  In my experience, more players = more fun. I wish they made regular D6's with the same weight as these dice -- they're fantastic! Unfortunately. player elimination is basically the point of the game and depending on how long someone has to sit out, that can sometimes ruin the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
At its heart, this really is just a simple dice game. There is some strategy, but not much. It does, however, pair the theme nicely with the mechanics, which are themselves fairly original. It also gets bonus points for production value, though I find it a bit of a shame that they went so overboard with it simply because it was designed by Richard Garfield.

Anyway, it's fun, which is what counts.

RATING: 6.5
Fun game. It doesn't really get to me like with some other people (it's basically just a Yahtzee variation with cards and hitting each other).

Main thing that makes it more interesting is the cards, that give a bit of variation to the game. And it's definitely a game that gets more fun with 5+ players. With 3, and even 4, it can be a bit boring.

Like the artwork.

I really enjoy push-your-luck dice games and you couldn't have a better theme on top of such a mechanism, King of Tokyo is a match made in heaven!

The game looks fantastic. The humor of the cards and characters is well done and very evocative and funny. This is a great game, especially if you have a sense of humor and don't mind player elimination.

After 10 plays with everything for 3-6 players, I must increase my rating to "10", this is an excellent game and one I'm likely never to tire of, especially with promised expansion due out before long. This has already become a favorite opener, closer and filler in my gaming group, and we even love an entire evening playing nothing but this game.

[b]GodZILLA-FILLER![/b]


[i]Kong[/i] of the Hill Yahtzee style dice-fest.

[b]When the red moon sets, and the sun rises in the West, two monsters will appear to save the people.[/b] 

1. Huge great chunky dice. Surprisingly meaty in my clunky great paws.
2. Short and sweet rulebook. You only [i]really[/i] need a one-sheet. Trouble is, in this dazzling interweb age, there are so many morons playing games, and asking dumb questions about those games, that game publishers have to try and provide 100-page idiot-proof rules (Mission: Impossible). The rulebook here is clear and colourful. Back in the day, this would have been a photocopied black and white printed wafer-thin sheet, accompanied by a ridiculous questionnaire that needed posting to Atlanta or some-place, and a wargames catalogue of delights.
3. Fantastic giga-monster theme. Everybody loves huge killy monsters. And splashing in muddy puddles.
4. Fast playing. Yeah, it's a filler. McD's cheeseburger-like filler. Sometimes I like me one of those, and I could eat two on the trot.
5. Excellent evocative art on the action cards - are all well named and fit the Toho company B-movie stylee, ensuring dramatic reading during gameplay: [i]He's grown another head! She's had a son! Crikes - look at all the grabby tentacles you now have! It's a absorbing all the energy. He's eating a skyscraper! Christ, it's growing even bigger! Shit - he's breathing radioactive fire at me![/i] type of thing.
6. Box and contents feel classy, not cheapo.
7. Simple and straightforward mechanisms.
8. Gateway game, certainly. Might even see if my GF will try it - I know my daughter will be a potential target for KoT when she's a teeny bit older.
9. There's room for light strategic play in here. Do I play passively or aggressively or build up my super powers? Obviously you switch it any way you like, dice depending.
10. Interesting decisions. Each turn you'll agonise over whether to concentrate on healing, fighting, energy conservation, or go on a victory point drive. Plus there's the choice of special powers to buy or save up for. Another thing (decision) is whether to stay as King of Tokyo, fighting back with your mega-paws the pretenders to your urban throne (while you hoover up valuable victory points), or yield like a surrender monkey, letting a helmeted 300' high spider-legged alien into Tokyo city.
11. Fun - in a laugh-out-loud manner occasionally. Especially if idiots like me make silly monster screeches during play, or your friends make declarations like "Now I have a massive new brain!"
12. Can cope with up to six players - ensuring, with 5-6 friends, that you will have two 'hills' to fight over: Tokyo city and Tokyo bay.
13. Fast to learn. Takes minutes, and everyone knows how to throw dice - so it feels intuitive and smooth.


[b]O' Godzilla! Destroy the people of Japan, who once tried to conquer the Azumi Tribe! You will be the instrument of our revenge! O' Godzilla![/b]

1. Yeah - you could be slaughtered before getting to do much, in a 4+ player game, but the game's short, and trashy, enough that an [i]elegant[/i] solution to that 'wasn't thought up'/'or needed' - delete as your confirmation bias allows.
2. Luck of the dice can be cruel. You get at least 2 re-rolls, but it's still luck. Managed luck, to a degree, however. BUT, you're not just rolling bones here, folks, you also have to manage your energy (represented by cubes) and your special monster powers (represented by cards). So there's that.
3. Shame it's not an actual Godzilla-themed game, but that's not a biggie for me - there's enough daft monsters to keep most people happy, with all the major monster 'stereotypes' covered; you know, big lizard, mecha lizard, giant monkey, huge fighty robot of destruction, etc.
4. Because it's a King of the Hill game, you are beating up on the leader each turn; but, as the leader, you beat back heavier on those lesser monsters who wanna muscle in on your Tokyo throne.
5. Not convinced on the greatness of the 2-player game. If you need an exciting and fun pastime before cracking out Dune for your group, I'd heartily recommend KoT.
6. Similar to Yahtzee and some other games. Knizia's [i]Scarab Lords[/i] has a 'wait a turn before grabbing any points' system too. I liked it there, and I like it here, but I will not eat green eggs and ham, Sam I am!

 
TRIVIA: Did you know that Godzilla even has his own star on the Hollywood walk of fame? Well, he does.

This is fun if you like yatzee style die rolling games.  The power up cards seem neat... but it seems they are usually underutilized in favor of collecting points or clawing each other out of the game.  It seems to overstay its welcome with many players, but with only a few players it can be a pretty quick filler.

I love the fact that the game play is not complex whatsoever, but instead allows players to strategize for an intense battle-it-out mechanic.  Very enjoyable!

Good, fast dice game.  It's all luck, but the "attack your opponents" mechanic gives incentive to go for something other than just rolling points (a downside to dice games like Zombie Dice, for instance).  
One thing this game really requires is the mutations expansion (a way to further augment your monsters powers - differentiating yours from everyone else's) .  It's a shame it isn't a default component, cause, really, once you've played with it, you won't ever play a game without.

RATING: 8
Basically it's a modern(?) version of Yahtzee. That being said this is the most entertaining Yahtzee me and my group has ever played. I may be dumbing things down when I said modern version of Yahtzee but the element of rerolling dices based on the situation and your ability to push your luck is similar to Yahtzee. But this is not Yahtzee. As much as there is deep in Yahtzee, so is King of Tokyo in itself. The mechanics of buying power ups and being able to invade Tokyo for power ups definitely makes the game a game of it's own. There is a lot of replay value for this game. Though there are some caveats as player elimination is possible and also a viable strategy to win. Aside from that this game is a must have.

This is the only board game from my collection that my 5 years old can meaningfully play. But even without him I've been enjoying this game quite a bit with friends. Sure, it's a filler game, sure, there a quite a lot of luck involved, but there is also a strategy and very clever game design. It feels very lean and well-thought. It's probably the best filler-game I've ever played.

Favorite dice rolling game. You get some light strategic choices going and often the game crecendos during the last two turns as someone is at 18/20 stars and two health while another has 7/20 starts and 8 health. Yes, player elimination can bother some, but in most games it's never been a big issue. My #1 gripe is that too frequently not enough cards get bought so the games can feel the same with minor variation rather than you developing a totally unique monster every time.

I am rating this game at 8 stars, My partner rates this game as a 9 star. This is by far one of her favorite games. She happens to be non-gamer/casual gamer. This was one of the first boardgames she enjoyed and would ask if I wanted to play it.

I just changed my rating from 7 to 8.  I played King of Tokyo for the first time with 4 players last night and it was brilliant.  My gaming group collectively has so many games that we usually play a game once then try something new.  The group wanted to replay this game.  Proving just how good it is.

Finaly we found a very nice quick 'roll the dice' game for playing ones or twice after a longer game.
Every game is difference with the cards.
In the turn of the other monsters you still have the adriline because you don't want to die. Very good game!

Fun and fast, perfect for in-between games. Can get boring and repetitive if overplayed, which tends to happen due to the easy accessibility and length of the game.

Birthday present from the wife! Game components are awesome and well made. 2nd Edition. Played with the ol' lady and it was OK. Need to play again to make the final decision.

Yahtzee nostalgia factor. Fun & light. 

UPDATE: played with three players (from playing only with two) and increased my rating a bit.

Yahtzee-style game, with 100% less category scoring and 100% more city destruction. Some rules vagaries only slightly tarnish a quick and fun romp with some genuinely interesting choices.

Simple, yet intertaining, great pick for a party - we've even rented cafes and restaurants to play this game.
They say it is better played with expansion or two.

One of my 7yo daughter's faves. Super fun, perfect game length. Our first 2 player game together went down to the wire with an exciting lucky roll for a come from behind victory. Go-to family game!

Mindless fun with dice and cool themed cards :)

RATING: 10
Oozes fun and is very easy to teach and enjoy. The cards are great fun and give each player (that is, monster) his/her own personality. It plays well with a wide range of players. 

Now to nitpick a little: the insert isn't particularly functional. Once I added the promo cards and expansions, which I recommend everyone do, I tossed said insert. The quality of the components (the dice in particular) should have been higher. Be aware I own a first edition. I believe the components were better in subsequent printings.

Fast and vicious fun fight among giants. Power up expansion recommended as it ads unique powers to otherwise generic monsters.

It's a lot of fun, but, having no one else in my gaming group(s) who are particularly interested in it, I can't justify spending $40 on it.  That's too expensive for a game like this, despite the fun I've had while playing it.

Great game however the sweet spot is 4 players. I'm not a fan of player elimination however if you keep the player total to 3-4 its not too bad.

Enjoyable on the first play, not sure how much depth there is there. Doesn't work brilliantly with 6 players.

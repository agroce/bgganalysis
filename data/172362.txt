RANK: 4300

RATING: 5
1st play: Love Letter meets Smash Up in card form.  Good player range but with 2 there are a lot of face down cards that can make it tricky to know when to deploy which cards where.  The art and production are top notch, as expected from Iello and the games are very fast.  I always appreciate a 'big reveal' at the end, and this uses that mechanic to good effect.

2nd play: Played with 3 and it's decent for a light filler.  Lots of hidden information and variety of battlefields make for thoughtful decisions based on partial info.  Not groundbreaking but plays quickly and has great production.

In the vein of my 2016 Game of the Year, City of Spies: Estoril 1942.

Semi-secret agents/fighters placed in different locations to win (area control) its VPs. The 10 locations themselves have some special rules/abilities/restrictions.

Every placement is potentially meaningful, so there is constant tension with every move.

VERY UNDERRATED HERE ON BGG.

Based on 1 game, the Supply Camp may be too strong.

Vous êtes un grand seigneur du Japon féodal. Vous prenez la tête de votre armée de cartes pour aller poutrer vos voisins parce que vous ne les aimez pas. C'est comme ça. Samouraï, général, assassin, paysans, jouez habilement pour gagner les territoires. Un jeu de pose de carte et de bluff, superbement illustré. Une de mes bonnes surprises du salon. Et si vous enlevez le thermoformage de la boîte, vous verrez une jolie dédicace de l'illustrateur pour la triche.

Area control card game with great art work.  There is a lot of iconography and may take a game or two to not have to think about what they all mean, but once you have it all makes sense.  The secret cards and all the special powers make for some good, tough decisions and add strategy.

Initial Rating Jan 29/17 - Nice art; a simple single round via with open and closed knowledge pieces/cards. For a filler it's not bad.

RATING: 8
Simple game design with enough parameters and moving parts/variables to keep it interesting from game to game. Playing with 3 or 4 players highly recommended, though 2 is also fun. Plays similarly to Stratego in the meta-game, but with additional rules and a faster pace.

Got this game during my overseas training back in 7/2015. The official English rules is only available now.
Gameplay is easy to understand and with almost no downtime, and is very good as a starter for game-night. It just lacks the charm of those hallmark games and we all don't find the urge to play again.

Great little game that's a lighter component version of Not Alone, set in feudal japan. 2-4 players have identical decks of 13 cards that they play to battlefields between themselves and each their left and right neighbors. Most cars are done so face down, and they all add (or don't add) power to your side to win that battlefield - win the most fields to win.
A head thinker with guesswork and hidden movement. Quinns likes in, and I'd easily put this in a game bag.

Man - I don't get how this is rated so low (6.5?? #6,000??) I've played through this at least a dozen times and it just doesn't get old. 

My best pro-tips: play the assasin last, use the Ashigaru as bait for the samurai, and only try to win 3 of the battlefields (but don't reveal to your oponent which you've given to him for free).

Technique for teaching this to new players: Play a regular game but without any of the cardboard battlefields. Just duel it out in the open so that the other guy can "learn the cards/units" without having to learn the terrain as well. Makes it far easier to grasp.

[COLOR=#FF0000]My thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]This has a similar vibe to Battle Line, but is much less interesting. It's a typical Iello production, which means nice components but artwork I'm not usually a fan of. The game seems more complex from reading the rules than it actually is. The biggest fault I have with the game is that you start the game with all your cards in your hand, which eliminates hand management which is one of my favorite aspects of these types of games. Strategies are very straightforward, cards powers are uninspired, basically I got totally taken in by one person's review. I wouldn't even recommend this game to families, Battle Line is easier to teach, offers much more strategic depth and is a great family game.[/i]

Really good artwork for a good game with known cards. Kind of like Knizia's "Battle Line" but with more interesting powers. Light and fast.

This is another take on the Battle line back, I think. I really should try that one so I know what I am talking about. In any case this game players have a hand of cards they are playing to try and win majorities in the center. It is not strictly 2p but can play up to 4p. I only played 2p but I think it will get extremely interesting with 3-4p. I would definitely like to try it again with more. Could be a cool little game. This kind of bluffing game I enjoy.

This is a cool game, a bit like Battle Line but playable with up to 3 (or 4 with teams), though there is a similar variant layout in Battle Line. This, however, stresses bluffing and unique powers over logic and deduction. Each flag here (select several at random) is worth (4-6?) VP and has a unique effect when resolved. The cards, drawn from identical personal decks, are played either face up or down as specified on each card. They have a variety of powers (kill a card on the other side, peek at a card, etc.), only some of which are resolved when the card is played. After all cards have been played, the flags are resolved one by one. For each, you reveal and resolve the hidden cards. Then, tally the total remaining strength; the higher side wins the flag (ties = no one wins). Whoever has the highest sum wins.

Fun game, although I think I prefer the simplicity and logic plays of Battle Line.

All players have same army. Play cards to battlefields to win each one by having more strength there.  Cards and battlefields can alter the strength of other cards. Aside form a 2p game, you only share 2 locations with each your neighbors so are fighting 2-2-2. Amazing art and just meaty enough to satisfy without bogging game play.

This felt very uninspired to me. It's all been done before, starting with Knizia's classic Battle LIne. The only differences here are that the territories for which the players fight have effects of their own, and some cards are played face-down in secret. But those two "twists" aren't exactly new, either. Not being innovative isn't necessarily a sin, but Kenjin's game play just isn't all that exciting, either. This one really comes down to outguessing your opponent ... it that gets your juices flowing, then Kenjin might be for you. it's hitting my trade pile.

A lot like BattleLine but with more special powers and the added interesting element of "hidden" cards. GORGEOUS artwork. Reasonably quick to learn and play, but a surprising depth of strategy. Cool three and four player variants (lining up the "grounds" in a Y so there are two that each player cannot "fight" for). Enjoyed overall - more engaging than Battleline but similar.

Even after five plays, my gaming partner and I are still having to consult the rule book for symbol help quite often. I like this game a lot, but I shouldn't be having this much trouble with symbols in an otherwise simple game. Don't get me wrong, though; it's a fun game.

GAME: Fist of Dragonstones
RANK: 2402

RATING: 5
Rating based on one 6 player game.
It outstayed its welcome and we stopped the game and played something else.
Maybe 6 players just makes it too long and less skilful. Lower number would make for more of fast, better game.
I really liked the simultaneous bidding and some of the cards were great, but I probably wouldn't want yo play again.

Falls into same category with Colossal Arena. Trying to read your opponent's mind is great fun.

The experience is too dependent on the company you play with. At best Fist of Dragonstones is great fun but it can be a painful experience, too. It all depends on how well you know your opponents and how fond they are of intrigue.

RATING: 6
Hidden bidding. Bluff, psychology and tactics. UPGRADE: I thought that everybody will like it but that is not the case. Most newbie find it boring and dislike trick-tracking auctions. And yes, the playing time can be even an hour, which is far too long (the mechanism is rather repetitive). Well, I still like it.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
There's more poker-like-bluffing in this than there is bidding.  I found it fun and sometimes hilarious - all that fiddling behind the screen and rattling coins to make people wonder whether you were really going to bid or not.

It's a good filler for half and hour and for that reason, too, I think I may play this quite a lot over the years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Occasionally a nice diversion with the kids, but gets tedious and runs very long for the gameplay involved.

I'm not sure how much game is really here, and yet, it's smiles all around as we try to bluff each other....

This game is a breeze to explain to newbies and there are often requests to play again. However if you do not like blind bidding this would be a nightmare as that is the only form of auction in the game, luckily I do.. so I enjoy this game.
With anything over four players this does become quite annoying and chaotic, but that's typical of any Faidutti... king of chaos

RATING: 6
played a long time ago, and recently revisited.  the first time around it seemed like 3 vps was far too few, since somebody could be in striking distance as soon as they had 1.  we played to 4 vps this time, and we felt the game wore out its welcome.  it's a very functional and complete game, and i don't think the bidding variant posted at http://www.faidutti.com/index.php?Module=mesjeux&id=332&fichier=151 is a necessary step.  blind bidding works for it.  so rules as written, well done.  the look and idea is still better than actual play for me.  very good production.  i think the only change i'd consider is doing a traditional around-until-passing auction for silver tiebreaker bids, starting with the player that has the fewest vps, or in the case of another tie the fewest stones.  just to slightly reduce the constant outguessing factor.

Hurm.  Played this last night [2013].  How is it revisiting after 10 years?

It's too long.

There's a game here (admittedly one with plenty of blind bidding).  The tweak which hasn't been reimplemented is the idea of everyone pays, coupled with auto replenishing money.

But really.  when each round is 10 blind bids, the game length needs to be short.  after we'd played six rounds, we were done. but we weren't even halfway.

RATING: 3
The cards are no where near balanced for only three bidders, making a three player game hardly feel like a "game" at all.  The game pretty much requires a maximum number of players.

The actual stones varied in size by their colors enough that it was possible to know what you were getting even with a blind draw.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Beautiful artwork, nice bits and terrific game execution - so why a measly 4? This is a fun game but there is very little payoff for the victor and the game can be very frustrating for everybody else. Getting to 3 points can technically be done in a single turn (assuming no one is paying attention). Because it's so easy to get to three victory points, there's a continual need to screw the leader(s) until there are too many leaders to keep track of. When you get into a situation like this, the games ends in a very unsatisfying way. The game just feels like a crapshoot (or a somewhat less lethal game of russian roulette). Certainly not average in terms of gameplay and components, but below average in terms of fun factor for me.

We don't get to this much because it's usually just my wife and I playing. And when we have a larger group, we'll usually go for a game with a board. But we enjoy this one. If you don't like blind bidding, then it's not a game for you. I happen to like it, even though I'm bad at it. One nice thing is that you don't need many points to win, so the game plays pretty quickly. If it was longer, I don't think it would be as enjoyable.

Blind bidding game. I really enjoy it as there are some solid strategies with all of the different poweres on the cards. However, 1 member of my game group HATES any kind of auction games, so this hasn't gotten played as much as I would like.

Seems like it would be a fun blind bidding game.  Great Days of Wonder presentation, as always.  Need to play more of it though, although it's unlikely to get played more until we add the 'varying auctions' variant.

A second copy was been bought because the bits are nice and usable for other purposes than the original plan (wooden coins, very good screens, glass stones) and hopefully one day this game will see play....

I don't have anything against blind-bidding. And this is not a terrible game, but it did feel kind of soulless even with the nice theme that the bits exude (reminds me of the better filler: Ruse and Bruise).  Dragged more than it should have.  It seemed repetitive and also seemed to lack any real options (get stones, get special guy that trades stones for points, win...).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Although I like the bidding system and the interaction of the roles, there are some definite downsides to this game.  The predictability of the betting can get annoying, especially when a player is out of gold and can't bid each turn.  Also the witch role seems to slow the game down more than is necessary, because players are constantly bewitching a role to stop others from scoring points.  So it feels a little too much like an uphill battle to reach 3 points.  Still the system works and I feel there might be a fun game in there, I just haven't found it yet.

The pieces, art, and cardstock are all top-notch in production value.  This is certainly one beautiful looking game, especially for the price.  But when I lose an auction, or even win an auction, I don't feel any tension or enthusiasm, and the game just kind of mucks along until the conclusion in a somewhat dull affair.  The cards just aren't interesting enough to make the blind bidding process exciting.  Some fun special cards but mostly dull dull dull.  This is probably getting higher than it deserves due to the quality components.

RATING: 2
I've only played it once (four players), and a lot of people seem to like it, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

To me, though, the whole game seems engineered to ensure a bad experience the first time(s) you play.  Lots of card text that have to be read each time, special abilities that counteract other special abilities... and you lose your bid even if you lose the auction?  So I can lose all my money and have nothing to show for it?  That mechanism should be banned from games.  I'm serious.

It seems many other people who dislike this game hate blind bidding in general.  Not me, I don't mind blind-bidding in some other games.  I think it's the combination of blind-bidding with loser-loses-his-bid-too that made this such an intensely frustrating experience for me.

Maybe after several games this game becomes enjoyable, but I won't be finding out.

I gave it a try, but this was the game that made me wary of bidding games, even if they have a nice theme and pretty pieces. I also find the game play very repetitive - perhaps that's actually why I don't like it much, rather than the bidding aspect. No plays since I started logging them - if we traded games (we don't), this would be my first candidate.

Blind bidding game.
Easy to learn and quick to play.
Can be bit repetitive, but that is easily handled by adding more cards into the deck that is auctioned.
You also need to increase the number of bidding stones you get.

This one can go waaaay too long. I played a 6 player game where everyone stopped the leader, then the 2nd leader, and so on until things bogged down to nearly a kingmaker scenario.  I'd had good experiences prior to that, but the game certainly needed another timing mechanism to end it that one time.

I like this game, quite a bit, but I can't seem to get it to the table. It's like many other games with blind bidding (holding a fist full of money), but it's nice in that you have a limited amount of coins to bet with each game. It's somewhat light and you can't play with people who get frustrated. My youngest son, when he plays, just throws the whole game out of whack (which I sometimes enjoy), like a rogue player that you have difficulty anticipating.

The game itself plays sufficiently quickly that its flaws are not dwelled on.

I would pull this out from time to time as a filler, but its not at the front of the line.

Its a bidding game where each player starts with 8 fairy gold, 2 regular gold and five silver. You try to win characters by bidding in a close fisted auction. The character provides some actions. The first to 3 points wins. You gets points by turning in Sets of Stones. You get stones by buying characters that give you stones. However the bidding has a very interesting twist. All players lose there stones in a auction not just the winner. After a set number of characters are auctioned you get your fairy gold back but not any regular gold you bid. There are some other finer points and plenty of characters which can set up some interesting play/bidding options.

Played once. An interesting game, but I felt slightly out of control the whole time -- the two other players had both played before. There's a good chance that I'd like it more if I played a few more times. Definitely a game with potential. Reminded me of Citadels - Faidutti left his fingerprints on this one.

RATING: 7
Another Faidutti chaotic ride (which is a good thing, in my book).  Play consists of a large number of blind bidding auctions to use the different powers of a variety of characters (you can see the influence of Citadels here).  The constant closed-hand bids can become a little tiresome; this would be an easier game on the computer, where you could just click.  But the tension of the game is enjoyable.  The players need to be familiar with the characters and vigilant of what their opponents may be able to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very decent blind bidding game in an enchanted setting. Don't expect this to be another Citadels: it isn't. Not by a long shot. The game material itself is wonderful: the artwork on the cards is phenomenal, and you get lots of bits to play with. It is great fun to do as a filler, but since there are only two new cards every bidding round, it tends to become quite repetitive after a while. This game should be played sparingly, with great lapses of time in between lest people get bored too easily. Also, if a single person has already scored two points, it is nearly impossible to keep him from winning unless there are some interesting cards in the auction deck. It does add nice tension, though. The rating is based on the feeling you have during the game, and not for its overall lasting and let's-do-another-game-shall-we appeal, for you really wouldn't want to see the notes the game would get [i]then[/i]. Sad but true.

[b]Update[/b] When I wrote the above there already were a few seeds of doubt about this game; when I played again hours before the time of writing, I noticed that these seeds had grown into full-sized trees. The main problems with this game are a) the small amount of coins you can bid with; b) the repetitiveness of the cards; and c) the typical Faiduttian chaos which causes the game flow to go all over the place. There are cards in there which are exceedingly nasty for too many people and [i]have[/i] to be blocked by the Witch, rendering their presence in the deck superfluous at the least. The overall result is that the blind bidding doesn't really work as well as it could be; and it is that friction that causes the 'meh' responses I always get. Downgraded the rating by 1 point; the phenomenal artwork for the moment halts further decline.

[b]Update 2[/b] Sold off. I had no intention to play this game again.

A fun game, but has a bit of an endgame problem, in that everyone can stop the leader from winning - but once a 2nd player catches up, the players who are losing simply aren&#039;t able to stop either of 2 players from winning (at least, not for long).  Then it often seems more like luck that determines the winner.

Components: Nice, subdued artwork on quality cards. The wooden coins and glass stones are functional.

Experience: I enjoy the limited card pool being bid upon each round, and the limited, replenishing funds. The introduction of two random cards each round spices it up. However, achieving three points can be a frustratingly slow process, and I am always at the mercy of others' capricious bidding.

This game features a blind bidding mechanic, which can really throw you for a loop, since you lose your money whether you win the bid or not.  Makes you think twice before putting that bid in.  Lots of tense moments... this has be a huge hit each time I've played it.

RATING: 7
I have played this only a few times. The experience so far has been quite positive. The game is very well made and quite fun as a light bidding game.

Because you lose the gold you bid (even if your bid is unsuccessful), there is a temptation to bid quite high on at least one or two cards to ensure you get something. If you are not careful this can leave you without any gold by the end of a turn - which other players can usually deduce from the number of your used gold.

Sessions are usually more interesting than I expect, but tend to be stressful due to sudden death bidding (win or lose depending on your ability to stop others' acquisitions).  Wife doesn't like blind bidding.

Really perfect blind bidding game.  Worth playing for the moment someone bids 10 to secure their next to last point and then sees all other hands turn up empty.  But 50 consecutive blind bids?  Plus however many tie breakers in there.  Gah.  And the amount of work it takes to get the last point makes people gang up and favors the second place person.

Didn't really care for this one.  A blind-bidding game with some take-that mechanisms.  I can see why some people like it.  But it incorporated some of my least favorite mechanics in an unthematic kind of way.  That said, it's not broken or anything and I could be talked into playing it again.  It's been awhile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players bid in an endless series of "in the fist" auctions for the right to use the actions provided by a deck of fantasy characters.  The actions essentially gain you gems, or let you convert those gems into points.  Three points and you win.  As with most Faidutti games, it's a chaotic ride and strategy seems almost irrelevant.  However, this one is a fun ride and it doesn't overstay it's welcome.  Stunning looking game.

Bidding and powers, love it!  Days of Wonder keeps cranking out great production values for their titles.  And the whole fist element is a physically appealing way to deal with bids.

Overall, I like this game, but it suffers from the same problems as Fantasy Business: 1) It goes on too long for what it is - one mechanic repeated over and over.  If it was about two-thirds the length, it would be very satisfying (have only played with 6 so far).  2) It's almost impossible for a player who falls behind to catch up.  If you have 1 point, and there are two players with 2 points, it's almost a certainty one of them will get 3 points before you have an chance to get your second point.  That's when the bidding really starts to get tedious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I enjoy this game, however I do have a few gripes.  With only 3 victory points needed, the game feels over before it's getting started.  The natural solution would be to house rule a higher number of victory point needed to win.  The only problem with this is that all of that bidding can grow tiring, and this is from someone who loves the blind bidding aspect of Warrior Knights and AGoT.

While I am not a big fan of games with bidding mechanics, this one does it well enough.  Some good decision making is involved, and the components are well put together. I wish that the money blinds were bigger for my big hands and for screening how much I have left to bid with, (they are easily knocked over), but otherwise it is okay. What I like is that it plays pretty quick, and does not come in a huge box.

I love auction games, and I am a big fan of Faidutti's contributions to the online gaming community but I did not like this game. It felt like Citadels with a slower, clumsier card drafting mechanism. It's too easy to accidentally cheat in this game by hearing the clicking of gold in an opponents hand. Also, like Citadels, the mid-end game slows instead of cascades. If I wanted to play another light role-selection game, it would have to be Citadels.

Out of Print auction, card game for 3-6 players.

For a good, 6-player card game of about the same length, I like this better than Citadels, and also Colossal Arena which only plays up to 5.

I don't like player screens but these at least, are sturdy, small, and don't tend to fall over.

Rules are few and easy to remember.  The cards all have text and knowing the cards is important (hard to win against opponents who know the cards), but the cards are not complex, and a simple reference sheet printed out here on BGG, should help first time player.

Blind bidding with lots to look out for.  The order in which the characters come up for auction really adds spice to the flow of the game.

Yet another bang-up job by Days of Wonder on the bits of this game. The stones are pretty, the coins are wooden (though the yellow "fairy gold" and beige "common gold" coins are hard to distinguish under some lighting conditions) and the cards are pretty. Too bad the game itself sucks. All blind bidding, all the time is not my idea of an engaging distraction, especially when that's all there is to the game. FoD feels like a retarded version of Modern Art. And where did the 3VP target come from? Despite the pretty presentation, the theme is... not applicable. There isn't even any pretense in telling you what you're playing for. Easily one of the worst applications of theme for a fully-produced Euro by a major company and designer. Anyway, people who love chaotic, shallow games might actually like this typical Faidutti creation. Otherwise, you may pass with no regrets.

Blind bidding with strangers == random results.   Very little strategy as cards come out in random order.   Tactics consist of trying to figure out how much others will bid.  Overbid, and your out of funds early.  Underbid, and you lose your money for nothing.  Get unlucky on a couple bids, and you will be out of the game waiting for the merciful end.   This is not worth the time to play.

Excellent game unless you hate bidding. This one uses a blind bidding mechanic that seemed to get just a bit old about mid-way through a six-player game, but then, as several people neared the 3 VP winner's total, the fun picked back up. With three players the game was over in less than 30 minutes - and a lot of fun. Certainly has elements akin to Citadels - but quite different. A lot of fun to play. Recommended.

Not a bad game, but in the three player game I tried, it certainly did not thrill me.  Better than I expected though...

Blind bidding is not for everyone, especially a game where the auction is the main mechanic, such as in this game.

An interesting game of closed fist bidding. Easy to learn and fairly quick to play.

I happened to play both this and Citadels for the first time in the same session and although by no means identical I did see some similarities in them but found Citadels to be the more appealing game.

This game is lovely, I can see why people hate blind bidding, but I personally think it works just fine.  I love the social interactions, such as second guessing, that the game creates.  It's also short, which is never bad.  Must be played at least four of the right people.

Veeeerrrrryyy underrated in my book. Not everyone's cup of tea, but the bluffing is absolutely amazing. If this game had a different theme, I'd bump it to a 10. This was my Grail game and my wife made it happen for me. I'm working on a re theme and expansion ideas.

RATING: 8
My favorite bidding game.  It takes the brain-hurting part of "A Game of Thrones" and distills it.  The game gets better as you learn your opponents' tendencies.  Plus there are lots and lots of great fan (and creator) made free expansion cards, just print and sleeve!

Blind bidding by itself as a game is kind of stupid.  I'm not a big fan of bidding games in the first place, but this one is pretty one-dimensional and lackluster.  Other than the fantastic production quality - the theme, mechanics, and gameplay are dull and somewhat nonsensical.

Finally played this game after having it for about 2 years.  Better late than never!  4P game with hubby and 6 and 11 year old daughters.  With kids that young, they don't fully get the bidding and that you don't want to drop a lot of coins too fast, but actually 6 year old could have won, but didn't bid appropriately when she had plenty of coins and 7 stones.  They do like getting the witch though. Hubby, not a big gamer, won the game and they would all willingly play again, so I will keep it, especially now that it is OOP.

Very smart design involving blind bidding.
It's not easy to get these 3VPs needed to win the game :)

I used to love this game (9.5(?) rating), but it has fallen out of favour with me.
Once I was enchanted by the clever design and possibilities to outwit your opponents, but right now I'm getting bored by the repetitiveness of the constant closed-fist biddings.
Yeah, there are moments of tension and emotions, but they are clouded by the general tediousness of the game.

RATING: 5
A game with some strategy, but the beginning can be highly luck driven.  To have a good game, players need to be aware of the powers of the different characters.  As a result, there is a learning curve to the game that can only be overcome by experience.  New players will frequently use too much money early in the turns, leaving the more experienced players with cheap actions later.  This has soured the expereinece when I ahve played.

Played with an 8 year old who spent most money in the early part of the turn and had none last for the last few cards.  It was still an interesting game to play with family and everyone seemed to like it pretty well.  It ended before the repetitive bidding dragged us down.   I suspect with 5 or 6 players it may take longer than it's fun but I'd be willing to find out.

OK, I broke down. I just think it sounds like fun. I like Citadels quite a bit and hearing that this was going to be a sequel to it...well, I'm curious; I just hope it's not too close to it.

RATING: 7
Played once.  Everyone seemed to enjoy.  Possible low replayability (which is improved by Special Characters).  We almost ended up in a stalemate type position where two people had to bid all their gold each turn stopping a particular character being won by the other - meanwhile the other players prospered.  Mystified by the games name, but suppose the more correct name of 'Fist of Fairy Gold' was not viewed as a good marketing idea!  3 points seems very short to begin with, but can actually lead to reasonable length game.

Blind bidding is my bane. I'm pretty sure that I will always be lousy at this. I've seen some complaints that it is too long and repetitive, but I think it is what it is: a well-designed game. 3 points to win seems right; 2 points would make the game too quick.

The theme and artwork are very uninteresting and borderline annoying for me, but the game is quite fun.  One must enjoy blind bidding, but there is a sufficient amount of information out there to prompt a lot of double/triple-think.  It can be hilarious to see what people bid/don't bid, and the bidding system (pay all your bid, no matter who wins) is brutal.  My one quibble with the game is that players need to keep moving, as a game like this should be relatively quick - no more than an hour.

Ugh, more blind bidding chaos. I just do not find it fun to try and outguess five other players on something each values differently. To make matters worse, I was worried that the first game wouldn't end before I got carpal tunnel syndrome. Since I was in last place I put all of my gold out on a miracle card that immediately won me the game - some people might like this kind of surprise but not me. I hope that those who enjoy it have fun but I'll be playing just about anything else (or nothing at all).

With its blind-bidding mechanism mixed with special power cards, Fist of Dragonstones is supposed to be the spiritual successor of Citadels. I can't say the filiation is obvious to me. The game is okay, the best part is its faery/common gold mechanism but it definitly shouldn't be played with too many players or there will be too much downtime due to indecisivness.

Very fun auction game. The components are top-notch (what else would you expect from DoW) and the random element is minimal - I've got the feeling that it just makes every single game more unique instead of deciding who wins and who loses. I think this game will see a lot of plays in my group - especially since it's quite fast. The more players take part, the more you have to predict what they will be doing and the better you have to be. =)

Won December 2014 at LoB Pub Quiz. This is a great take on the role selection game. Because you blind bid the auctions are very quick and each game is over pretty quickly.

Outstanding game. Another great game by Faidutti.  
Bumped down to an 8 from 9 on July 17th. Great game, but not just a nine.

6.24.09 Looking abck at early commecnts I wonder what I was thinking. 

What is the difference between and 8 and a 9?

I like this game for 3-5 players. Probably have 2-4 un-logged plays of this game. I've never had a bad time with this game. Usually the opposite - always fun and interesting. 

The variable cards for bid really mix the game up. It is also interesting to see how different groups value the witch.

I love a fantasy theme. I love a game with wonderful production values and bits. This is decent game that works well; and it plays fast. Playing fast is a good thing, because all it is is blind bidding. Which can get to the -- ad nauseum -- point after more than one go. Still, it will stay in our collection because of the parts we love, and to take out, impress our friends and maybe entertain them now and again for 15-20 minutes.

My favorite Vizzini type outguessing game, but unlike in Citadels here you win the roles by blind bidding which adds an extra layer of bluffing to the psychological screwage. Works pretty well with 2 to 6 players, kids from 6 usually like it.

I really like the simplicity of the game play and the difficult choices, bluffing and sneakiness.  Need to re-rate after more plays.  I like it a lot, but each time I've played it the conditions have been less than ideal - many outside interruptions, players not feeling good, etc.

I'll be the voice of doom this time--I'll take Citadels over this every time.  I like blind bidding games, and I love "special power" games.  What I don't particularly like or dislike is this fusion of them.  The one element I appreciate the most is the variable 2-character set per turn, which keeps each turn from being identical.  The one thing I appreciated the least was the failure to include a third black piece--I don't care how rare the situation may be that requires one, include it with the damn game!

As far as blind-bidding games go, this one is actually decent. Gorgeous card art and lots of opportunities for messing with other players' minds. Mechanics are a little too balanced; don't play with more than 4, otherwise this game can last forever (2/3+ hours).

RATING: 7.75
The ulimate blind-bidding game.  Players bid on roles (a la Citadels) which allow them to: screw other players, gain fairy gold (for bidding), gain silver coins (for tie breakers), gain dragonstones or turn in dragonstones for victory points.  3 victory points and you win.  Victory points are public knowledge and players will start gunning for you if they think you're about to win.  With the right crowd a fun mix of tactics, deception and a bit of luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Brightly-coloured and -produced game, but I don't think the gameplay is very interesting.  The bidding seems too predictable (once everyone understands the cards that stay in play, it's pretty simple to see what the best route for other players will be), but once the game is about to be won the pressure mounts.  The highest-ranked player will either get many options to win (making it well-nigh impossible to deny), or there will not be enough ways to win (making it no longer enjoyable for that player).

RATING: 6
Revised my rating downward to "6" from "7" after revisiting this after a long stretch where it sat on the shelf. For some reason, blind bidding games don't bother me, but they bug nearly everyone in my family and in my local circle of gamers. Thus I'm unloading this.

My biggest gripe is that it's difficult to "bid zero" without everyone knowing it, unless all keep their coins in hand under the table all the time (which gets annoying, too). The game concept itself is stellar, I just wish there was an easier way to run the bidding (e.g., the "combat wheel" from Dune, although that would have tripled the game's price).  Maybe use numbered cards 0-12 from some other game?

My kids enjoyed this one and the theme helped in that department.  I occasionally enjoy the tension a blind bidding game produces and this game does provide that tension.  My only question is why wasn't this game called "Fist of Fairy and Common Gold" since you never put the dragonstones in your fist.  Update: 11/17/08 played this at work during lunch and everyone hated it.  Seems to be missing a key ingredient - fun.

Une heure à se dire à chaque minute "ah, avoir su, j'aurais fait ça"; "j'aurais dû..."; "zut, je n'aurais pas dû"; "oh tiens, j'ai eu de la chance sur ce coup-ci".

De plus, l'iconographie n'aide en rien à se rappeler les pouvoirs des différentes cartes.

Le début de partie est trop lent, le milieu de partie trop monotone, et la fin de partie n'arrive pas assez rapidement! 

Ok, ça "fonctionne"; mais n'est clairement pas dans mes goûts.

RATING: 5
A Bruno Faidutti game. Each person has 10 gold to bid with for 8 characters in a round. Highest bid wins, everyone else loses the offered gold for that round. As expected from a Faidutti game, emphasis is on doublethink, canceling one&#039;s actions with a character, and so forth. Game becomes skewed if someone gets to 2 VPs before anyone else (game ends at 3 VPs), and that happened all the time, since a recurring character allows one to sell gems for 2 VPs. This forced people into playing defence and ruining the game, when one has to bid all gold for a character just to deny the leader (and leader could second guess everyone by not bidding). Not real exciting for me when played as a strategic game, but I guess as a light game where you just observe the mechanics, it&#039;s okay.

RATING: 4
First time I played a 4-player game of this and I liked the bidding mechanics. There are two separate piles of bidding chips for regular bidding and tie-breaking bidding. Clever. I didn&#039;t like special card aspect that much. Now I played with 3 and it wasn&#039;t as good as I thought. Quite repeatitive after all.

A better game than Citadels, provided you don't mind the repetition of the closed-fist bidding.  Players who keep going for the "screw you" characters (Witch and Thief) can't win, but might make the game rather unpleasant for everyone before they figure that out.  Gorgeous artwork from one of the chief illustrators of the Agone role-playing game.

This is a good light auction game.  Its interesting that everyone is involved in every round.  The victory conditions of 3 points seems low until you start playing.  I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  This game is by the same designer as Citadels and there is some familiarity between the two games.  Fist of Dragonstones is the lighter and quicker of the two games.  But if I could only play one I would play Citadels.

I like this game more each time I play it. The 2 random characters each round insures that no 2 games will play the same. I had originally thought 3 points for a victory would make for extrememly short games but that wasn't the case and it was balanced well.

Typically &quot;Faidutti-chaos&quot;, but fun nonetheless.  The critical flaws, in my opinion, are the repetitive gameplay and the susceptibility to bash-the-leader.  Games I&#039;ve played usually end with three or more players one point away from winning, with the winner being the one the others chose not to gun for.  Very pretty game, though, as is typical with Days of Wonder.

Two major problems with this game. First it is an auction game in which the loser pays their bid, too. This just seems to make people overpay for something just to make sure they get ONE thing before the round ends. And this in turn leads to the second major problem. With it happening so often that players only really win one item per round, the game can drag on way too long. I hope I never see the "loser of the bid has to pay, too" mechanic again. It is a horrible idea and this game really sucks.

Fist full of Stones or a fist full of Dollars. I'll take some diamonds please. One of Faidutti's character selection games. Today I will review this game as if I was a prince! As a noble bachelor, I take on many roles such as diplomat, philanthropist and part protector of the land. My mission is to be king and to prove myself I will collect precious stones. A character from the city appears, like the witch or fairy all with their own abilities. I must secretly bid money, when all I want to do is show all my riches. Sometimes I win stones, which I must also collect and then trade for points, which seems a bit silly as I love diamonds. 3 points is my goal and also to find a fitting princess. Playing this game and bidding my money only to be out bided time after time is so boring though. I'd rather listen to my minstrel play a tune, or go to a 3 hour opera than to play this game. Conversing that thought, besting the peasantry by relieving more money is fun, I would just rather best them in a different way.

Didn't make the cut as I am too busy courting princesses.

It was very interesting and it was hard and challenging. I loved that I was the one who always won the witch token.

First playing wasn't what I'd hoped it'd be. Too little information to make any real judgments, so the blind bidding is as fulfilling as playing Raj. Especially true if some of the players essentially bid erratically, introducing a chaos factor in a game that should be about, at best, shrewdly calculating the 'worth' of each auction to each player. Six player game took way too long for what it was. Not my kind of game as it felt like 90 minutes of frustration. Will play again if the 'group' needs me but otherwise not.

I am quite surprised at the number of low ratings for this game. This is easily one of Bruno faidutti's best.

After reading the rulebook I was very turned off by the idea of blind bidding, but once I finally got the game to the table it all went much smoother than expected. Knowing which cards are left in the deck leads to just the right amount of strategy for gamers who know how to play the odds. The game plays REALLY fast and can be over in less than two full rounds. I taught and played my first game in about 20 minutes. Has a similar feel to a lot of other games, but I think there's room for this filler in my collection.

BLIND BIDDING 
Only played this one a couple of times, I'm a bit lukewarm on this one.  My 10yo daughter that is not very gaming inclined really seems to enjoy this one though.  On the plus side it is a reasonably fun, short duration, family game that plays five.

Very Faidutti-ish, with simultaneous sealed auction bids on randomly revealed cards: lots of chaos and luck.  Not a serious game, but I had fun playing it and liked it more than the vaguely similar Citadels, which seemed more prone to screwing a player with bad luck than this game.

We get it in Polish Math Trade #4 (2010-03)

RATING: 6
Good game.  Another good Faidutti game in a small box.  I love good games that come in small boxes.  The game plays very clean and quick with character ability auctioning.  It feels a little like Citadels, ie. using card abilities, only with characters instead of buildings having abilities.

--Aug2005-- I was surprised how little this appealed the last time I played.  The game went on & on & on all to little amusement or delight.  I guess, though, that that's the tendency of the (blind) bidding mechanic:  if there's too much groupthink, the game slows to a glacial pace.  I think the remaining puzzle is why I still find Caribbean amusing!
--Jan2015-- As I age, I'm even less forgiving of the blind-bidding pattern (particularly when, as here, tied bids have no resolution.)

Some have compared this to Citadels for the role selection, but at its heart, this is a bidding game. The rules aren't difficult, but there is a void in my memory so that I can never remember them. The production values are high, and it's a good game for a group, though it can run long.

RATING: 5
Players are princes in a quest for dragonstones.  Nevertheless, they have became bourgeois and don't want to take the risk for achieving such gems; so they just subcontract magic characters to do the dirty work for them with a blind bid method.  Long live to magic outsourcing!!!  Characters provide different abilities, but the main ones are those which allow to get money, dragonstones, or to change dragonstones for victory points.  The first to get three points wins.  The game is OK, but the mechanic becomes repetitive real quick.

RATING: 7
Very accessible game for newcomers.  It's all about blind bidding, but the myriad card powers allow a lot of room for offensive and defensive strategies.  A lot of fun, and quick moving.  I was just re-hashing the last game we played with one of the participants.  He thought it only took 15 minutes to play(the time went by so fast), when in fact it was more like 45 minutes.

Very fun bidding game. The character cards and different kinds of coins keep things clipping along nicely. Good bits and artwork. The only thing I can say that is somewhat negative is that the actions are very repetitive as all you ever do is bid nonstop and the constant thrusting of your fist into the middle of the table gets monotonous after a while.

Finally played this last night.  Interesting game.  The different character powers make for interesting and very Bruno-esque interactions.  The closed fist auction mechanic does get a little old, but that happend just shortly before one player got their third point to win the game, so it's pretty on target for a good game length and doesn't overstay it's welcome.  Days of Wonder's trademark production quality, makes this a good little game to own, especially if you can find it on the cheap.  I probably won't be rushing back to play this over and over again, but I'd suggest it on occasion, and I'd certainly be willing to play if someone else suggested it.

Nice components. Love the stones. Game is INDEED a redevelopment of Citadels with less of a direct hurting of opponents. Player start with limited resources and bid for 'characters' that provide gemstones, money or points in exchange for gemstones. Good tense moments. The special characters are interesting enough. We played a variant where we remove 1 base character before auction round. Solid offering but a little too much like Citadels.

Undoubtedly, the WORST game name in history (beating out Bollox).  Anyone want to get in some fisting?  Because of the name, the font "error" (We call it Fist of the Dragonst Ones), and the fact that it seems a repetitious blind bidding game this didn't hit the table for about a year.  A real shame. This one is a beaut.  It is what I consider the third in Bruno's Character driven trilogy (Citadels, Castle) and is as good.  Many tough coices make this engaging, but the spirit is light enough that it becomes quite social.  Great group think game.  

UPDATE: Despite the fact that this game, for the most part, is totally stupid, it is still quite a bit of fun.

An excellent filler game.  I like that you get to auction for essentially the same set of cards and that you can somewhat keep track of what other people have available.  The random cards that you get each round mix things up just enough, and I really like how pretty the bits are.

UPDATE: I usually played this with three, where it goes fast enough to become a filler.  With six, it's still a quality game, although it takes longer to play.

RATING: 5
Perfect example of a game that's just not for me (or my current group).  It's not bad, and the character powers that you bid for are reasonably entertaining, but for a blind bidding game where there is not strong directional growth along multiple paths it far outlives its interest.  If the game were 15 minutes it would be different, but then the game as is, wouldn't be as interesting with the power-interplay.  Or if the game followed multiple paths to victory over a larger curve, the game would be different as well (it would be O Zoo La Mio!).  There are more interesting ways to spend 45 minutes, so this one will go on the trade pile for someone who will enjoy those powers enough to last the entire game's length.

RATING: 2.5
This Faidutti-Schacht marriage is just not working for me.
Randomness and chaos from the card, repetitive blind bidding, 3 kinds of money to manage and minimal set collecting are all mechanics that aren't mixed well together in this game.

I guess the fun comes from double guessing your opponent and bluffing but to me there was too many variables (money, cards, interest, witch, thief) to track to evaluate each bid which only made the game tedious and no fun.

[DoW 'Fist of Dragonstones' 2002 edition] {Fantasy; blind-bidding, utility cards; optimal 4-6p} A typical Faidutti's game. Fun and chaotic with strong interaction. It's a pure blind-bidding game but is short enough before players got bored. Besides, it's the best blind bidding game I have played till now.

The bits are pretty: the wooden chips, glass stones, etc. DoW never fails us in bits quality.

Strategy? I don't think there are serious strategies here but there are many tactical options. Use your money wisely is very important. The tie-breaking part is especially intriguing - it can be a way to achieve your goal or it can be a waste of your money.

[Update] I dropped the rating because it has been occasionally dragged too long when every player played too defensively and the game can't progress at all.

It's (usually) quick and the rules are simple. The game can be a bit frustrating and repetitive at times and ultimately the luck factor is quite high (not necesseraly a bad thing, just makes it lighter). Gamelength can vary alot from 15 mins to up to 2 hours... I prefer steadier gamelengths.

Played again on 9/4/14 after many years of not playing and found that it seemed to really drag. We gave up mid way through which is something we virtually never do.. Funny how things move on over time especially bearing in mind how much fun I used to get from this back in the day. Maybe my tastes have just evolved or maybe I am now used to more modern games. Whatever the reason I was left feeling disappointed and sad that this much loved game didn't live up to my memories of the good old days! Down rated from 7 to 4.9. (10/4/14)

A nice filler, but in reality is simply auction after auction after auction.  And some people aren't really interested in such a thing.  Even one person that decides that it isn't worth playing is going to make the game uninteresting, so make sure everyone knows what they're getting into before you introduce this game.

Revised January 2010 to a 5.  This isn't a bad game, but it's been surpassed by so many things that it's been years since it's seen play.  I think it has a flaw in that given you're auctioning many characters each round, it's possible someone ends up being one of the only people with money remaining and can buy many in a row, cheaply.  The correct response to this is "Well, people need to be aware of it."  But when it happens that isn't the way players act, instead, they consider it a flaw in the game.  It's more 50/50, but it's kept it off the table.

Fun game.  The auctions feel a little repetetive so I don't like playing this over and over.Good family auction game.  The feel of Citadels, but a little easier for the kids.

Update:  I have increased my rating from 6.5 to 7.  This game is easily a fun 7 when it is played QUICKLY.   

The auctions really are repetitive, but when players really have insight to what each card can do for you and can act on that with speed this game works really nicely.

The problem is that to get to that point you need to play a few times, and  those few times can feel unrewarding.  I liken this experience to another blind bidding game, O Zoo Lo Mio. These are both games that have the right depth-to-time ratio only when everyone is experienced.  

Update:  My last play was so dull I am tempted to lower the rating, but I have to remember that I did have a good deal of fun with it before.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4

Nothing but auctions over and over again, of the same stuff that change the game state only slightly, with incredibly low scores (3 points wins). The only way you will win is if the other players collectively are negligent and fail to block you from winning an auction you need. That's pretty dull! Couldn't finish my solo test game for this reason.

It is like Citadels in that there is a clever role selection mechanic, fastened to a frustratingly shallow system.

...Also the idea of having a separate game currency whose only purpose is to resolve tied bids (via another auction) is about the clunkiest thing I've ever heard of.

i think i am a sucker for blind bidding. of course, "blind" is a misnomer. the whole fun is predicting the actions of others based on (your perception of) their optimal play.

Interesting combination of chaos (a la Faudutti) and auction (Schacht). At its best, Dragonstones is an excellent psychological game - Poker for fantasy geeks. At its worst it's still good, but can be too random or be over too quickly. The distinction is somewhat dependent on player skill... it's important that enough of the table understands the defensive game for the game to be at its best.

As someone pointed out, these should be called "bribes" not "bids" since everyone pays, not just the winner.

I wish the insertion of two custom characters each turn, in addition to the lineup of The Usual Suspects, is a mechanic Citadels would use, too.

This is a faster, more interactive version of Citadels, basically. The tension at the end of the game can really build... I'll always choose this over Citadels (unless we only have 2, of course).

Underrated game.

Although not the most exciting of games, it can get very cuthroat. It's worth playing just to see the beautiful artistry and variety of the playing cards.

Blind-bidding can either be lots of fun with the right group or bone dry with the wrong group. In general, I find the card powers and the things you bid for to be rather bland and uninspired. I prefer Bruno's citadels a whole lot more. That game has more tension and also some skill. FODS is extremely luck driven. Sure, you can try to read someone's intention but in general, you still have to rely on gut instinct.  On the fence with this game but likely won't be hitting the table that often. Citadels still is Bruno's best game.

RATING: 5.5
Not all that I hoped it would be. With right combination of house rules and players it can work. However, Dragonstones consistently drags for me, even when I am enjoying it. 
Luck is an overpowering factor which diminishes the need for any long term strategy. Another pet peeve with this game is the lack of any set convention to the closed fist bidding. Our group usually does all sorts of silly showboating to make this part fun. Still the bidding feels pretty awkward. 
Production values from the fledgling Days of Wonder were strong and have been ever since.

I enjoy standard bidding games (ie Medici), but wasn't sure if I'd like the blind aspect as much.  Turns out I do like it!  My group likes Citadels and now highly enjoys Fist of Dragonstones.

RATING: 4
Components are fantastic, no problem there.  The bidding system is okay, but it rewards an all-or-nothing approach, where you bid high on one or two cards, because they are what you want or need.  Sometimes the game is too short, and it ends just as it seems to get going.  Sometimes the game is too long, and devolves into bash the leader.  I have yet to have this game hit a middle-ground sweet spot.  I'd rather play either a different filler or a different bidding game.

Bruno's design and blind bidding. It gets repetitive after one round and the fantasy theme is not appealing to me. Strangely, I find Dragon's Gold to be Bruno's more enjoyable game.

Bruno Faidutti & Michael Schacht; Card bidding game. Players try to outwit their opponents by using gold and magic coins to buy control of an ever-changing cast of enchanted character cards. Those characters' powers collect valuable Dragonstones; lend their magical powers; help foil other players, and convert Dragonstones into victory.

I really like blind-bidding, and I predictably liked Fist of Dragonstones.

Games can drag-on a little, and is better with lots of table-talk.

RATING: 5
This is an interesting design, with some interesting things happening, but it seems to miss the mark in the actual play of the game.  The complaints about the game being one mechanism over and over is correct, and it's hard to feel engaged with that experience.  Given the choice, I would rather play Citadels or Mission: Red Planet, games that also have variable role selections, but have more interesting things going on around it.

1 play: 4 players

This is a good filler, can be really quick, can be a bit long. It still is good, an auction game, with some cuteness in it, but not so much that you can't stand it.

RATING: 6
Nice game, not one I want to play all the time, but very solid for its niche.  Sure, it's chaotic and can be exceedingly frustrating if you're just barely overbid *all the time*, but I think the overall structure is quite interesting.  It's also quick, which suits its weight nicely.

RATING: 5
Not a huge fan of blind-bidding games, but this one is fun.  I wouldn't play it all the time, but I can see getting it out once in a while.  What makes this amazingly unforgiving is that you lose what you bid if you dont win.  That is a feature that bugs me a bit.

One of those games that sounded really fun when I opened the box and read the rules.  The first round of bidding was interesting.  Then it got monotonous and boring.  If the card supply varied more, it might be more interesting.  I feel about this one a lot like I feel about Citadels, but this one ranks slightly better.

My wife loves this game and for this reason I love it also. It's an incredibly simple auction / bluffing mechanic, but it offers real depth. It's best with at least 4 players.

This game hits the table a lot because my wife has veto authority over Cosmic Encounter, but I'm not disapointed. People complain about the severity of the betting mechanic (losing bids also lose money) and the gang-up-on-the-leader phenomenon, but these are the source of the game's charm. Every bid is intense, yet the unpredictability of other players (and to a lesser extent, the theme) prevent this game from feeling unpleasantly cut-throat.

Great components. My copy is very old but still holds up well. This was the only 'designer' board game we had growing up, and I loved it then. I hope this turns into my wife's gateway game.

There's no mechanic I hate more than blind bidding where your bid is spent win or lose. And this game is designed entirely around that mechanic. The ONLY thing I like about this game is that it usually ends so quickly we can move on to something I don't consider a waste of my time.

RATING: 5
Seems like a good enough game.  My biggest concern is play time as our group was only scoring one point per turn.  A couple of players had plenty of gems that they could have converted if they bid more on the ones that allowed them to easily get VP.  I have a feeling it would play a big quicker the second time now that we know better what the standard cards are and how everything works together.

A couple of things really set this game apart from other bidding games that I've played.  1) what you bid is spent regardless of weather you win or not and 2) there are many bidding rounds before your resources are renewed (although this happens to a lesser degree in other games, such as Modern Art')

It's interesting, and I like it.

Others didn't like this one as much as I, and our first play was severely marred by Harmon and his lady friend, so it was traded for PG: Factory Manager in a math trade.

Another solid Faidutti game that feels like a Citadels themed bidding game.  The fairy gold mechanic is very cool IMO, and the whole game is just a lot of fun.  Everyone I play with seems to agree that playing to 4 VPs is a must though.  Terribly underrated.

This game wears out its welcome about half way through. 4 rounds of bidding for 10 characters equals 40 times you have to put your fist out, 20 of which at least will be empty. And the last game I played lasted 8 rounds at least.

I want to play this some more, but it's pretty enjoyable for what it is.  If you don't like blind bidding games, then by all means, stay away.  People who are observant will do better than those who think that all of this is random; after all, you can see exactly how much fairy gold each player has spent so far during the turn.  I'm going to give it a fair chance. Ratings update (11/19/04): After a few more plays, this game's rating has plummeted for me.  It's too long, too much of the same thing.  And more often than not, one player will "luck into" the win, rather than having a strategy to get there.  I can do without this.

Nice "Bruno" game where you try to outwit your opponents to gain points for yourself and hinder the others. Auction type where you use a set amount of money each round, secretly bidding for cards that will give you stone, or turn stones into points of mess up your opponents. Always enjoyable.

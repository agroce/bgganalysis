This was one of the first games that I "searched" to buy.  I had played several war games over the years, but none of them I wanted to own for myself... until this one.

Like a computer game played via two booklets.  Nice filler, highly portable and fun to boot.  Not as good as Wings of War, but pretty playable even today.

This is an innovative design: the flip book/battle book perfected!  It plays quickly and is highly portable.  Stay away from the advanced rules that work on adding a third dimension.  They are too fiddly.  Enjoy this simple game for what it is.

RATING: 8
Well it's time to don the flying gogles and jump into the Sopwith Camel. Excellent booklet game that does a good job of evoking a WW1 dogfight. I wonder though if it stands up in the video age. Someone is bound to come up with a hand held electornic version sooner or later.

I was absolutely addicted to Ace of Aces (World War One series) in the latter half of the eighties. Played it everywhere with my old buddy Danny MacDonald, including on the bus and over the phone! Very realistic, but eventually, the system becomes predictable. I'm just thankful it took me so long to figure that out! POOKA-POOKA-POOKA!

RATING: 9
For its time it was truly a game invention, the same way D&D was a game invention. It did not have the depth of gameplay of D&D but, for its time, the game was the first non-computer computer game. You could play it over the phone; anywhere where you could communicate with your opponent. But it really is a two-player game. I am glad to know Al Leonardi and while we formed Nova, it was a great run. But after that Coleco called which was too much to hope for.

RATING: 6
The charm of this game stems from the fact that it is not a pc game.  Turning it into one would just make it another flight sim.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A classic. If you stick to the basic rules, you can play several games in an hour. Back in high school we would play campaigns over lunch. All (or most?) books in the series are mutually compatible so there is a great deal of replay-ability. Now overshadowed by flight sims on tablets, the Ace of Aces series remains a must have to go in your bug out bag for when the power grid collapses.

The first of the Ace of Aces games. There were a couple of printing errors in this set and the gunfire graphics were unclear on some pages.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
With this edition, they fixed the printing errors and gunfire graphics of the first Gameshop edition, making this the choice for Ace of Aces collectors who want to play the earliest fully playable version of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Arguably the best edition of the Ace of Aces games. The printing errors of the earlier versions are fixed and the game comes in a nice slipcase for the first time. This edition is also refreshingly free from the legalese trade marks after the title that was plastered over the later editions. Not a big deal by any means, but nice to see.

This one would be my favourite game ever if it got a modern update with nice graphics.  I played this with my brother for years and with hundreds of plays, perhaps even over 1000, this game is top of my 'most played games' list.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The second slipcase edition made no gameplay improvements, but added the "all important" legalese trade marks to the game box.

A very enjoyable 2 player with a very unique system. The books really give a feel of dogfighting. I enjoy just playing with the beginner rules but will introduce the increased strategy of the intermediate and advanced rules to my 10 year old very soon and see what he thinks. Good stuff!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really innovative system, appears to be magic until you figure out its just a 5 by 5 grid.  Still, understanding that does not detract from the enjoyment as you can then actually apply tactics and second-guessing.  Great game for just about anyplace.  Try 2 on 1 sometime, a great challenge for the 1 but quite fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Some good times with this little game back in the day.  As others have mentioned, if you're spatially challenged it can be a bit tricky to visualize exactly what's going on.  It's not the same as looking down on a hex map and seeing where you are in relation to other planes.

A great little game to travel with - can be played almost anywhere. Certainly gives you the feel of a dog-fight as you try to predict your opponent's manoeuvre. Nothing quite like turning to a page to see your guns blazing at the opponent's plane.

The one that started it all...a clever system porting a hex-grid game into a picture-book system.  The first set also was a harbinger of sorts of some of the sloppy research that would "haunt" the series (at least in its WWI incarnation).  McCudden is listed as a Pup pilot (even though he never flew it at the front, having flown it in home defense squadrons), Fonck is listed as a Nieuport 17 pilot (while in reality, he mainly flew Spads) and Billie Barker is described as someone who "often flew while wounded" and given the ability to shake off the effects of wounds when in reality, he was shot up on his last sortie over the Western Front and passed out several times during the epic battle that earned him the Victoria Cross.

The hand-drawn illustrations give the game a nice "feel"...but the rearward looking illustrations are wrong...the German book is drawn as if the player were sitting in a Sopwith Camel (you can tell by the squared off elevator) and the Allied book is drawn as if the player were sitting in a Fokker Dr. I (you can tell by the triangular elevator).  Errors in rearward looking views seem to haunt this series.

I wanted to like this game because of the theme and the 2-player interaction.  However, the small print combined with constant page-flipping was too tedious, and I never felt like I was caught up in the theme of the game.  More like one of those choose-your-own adventure books, but with two people trying to sync up a pair of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A revolutionary approach to design, with a 'visual combat matrix' providing a solid and unobtrusive combat system supported by a graphic presentation of the aerial dogfight theme which made it a pleasure to play.  I was much impressed at the time and, even though it's a while now since I've played, there are lessons still here for other designs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
On the one hand, I don't want to see the game short as it is one of the best air combat games, board, card, or book. On the other hand, the "air combat" genre is a tricky one that really hasn't been done well. The deterministic nature of the game, and the fact that it's very simplistic with so much left out, kills it for me. As a kid, though, it was a fantastic travel game for those long bus rides, as it's got to rank as one of the best highly-portable games.

This is our original filler game, and the first gamers' game I taught my kids.  Never looked into the more detailed rules, because the basic game is just excellent by itself.  A fantastic game system really, perfect for long trips in the car and similar situations.  I have the Nova edition.

This was a gift from a good friend of mine when we were in high school, back in the ‘80s. At the time it was part of the revolutionary Fighting Fantasy style of book-games, and I really enjoyed it. Nowadays it seems to be the sort of thing that video games have replaced. Still, great fun.

This WWI air combat game is very unique. You each get a book for your plane. The books are filled with drawings of your view out of your plane as you are looking at your opponent. On the bottom of each page is a list of maneuvers that the plane is capable of. You each secretly pick the maneuver that you want your plane to execute then compare pages listed and see where you end up. Planes fly at one of three speeds and this limits the maneuverability of your plane. If you can get behind your opponent they have to tell you weather they are going to execute a left, right or straight maneuver. If you can get your gun pointed at the other plane, the closer the better, then you score hits. I can not help but feel that the end result is realism far beyond the classic turn based wargame with tons of rules. This could be the only game in existence that plays very well and is fun over the phone.

Clever WWI dogfight game.  Each player owns a book of illustrations of a pilot&#039;s view from the cockpit, spotting an enemy fighter.  Players fly their plane and their choice of direction dictates what page of the book players go off to.  It could result in one fighter getting a shot opportunity at their enemy.

The Ace of Aces series is a unique product of its time. A few years earlier and printing the books might have been too expensive for the same quality and a few years later Microsoft Flight Simulator made the series look like an anachronism. 

Each game in the series consists of two books in a slipcase along with a pamphlet of rules and charts. Each book has hundreds of first-person pictures of the opponent's plane as viewed from the cockpit of your own plane. At the bottom of each page is a row of icons for your available maneuvers with page numbers beneath them. After each player selects a maneuver, they exchange numbers. Each player turns to the page number given to them by their opponent and then looks for their maneuver at the bottom of the page. If both players did this correctly they will end up turning to the same page. (A nice self-correcting algorithm.) 

The game includes introductory rules as well as levels of additional chrome that can be added to increase the weight.

Feb09: That's pretty darn cool for a game that's as old as I am.  It plays quickly and somewhat realistically!  It's a wargame that I can really get into.

It has very little downtime.  The components are just books.  The rules are easy.  The decisions come fast.  And it's fun to shoot down the enemy!

It's a winner.  Too bad it won't be published again...

A provisional rating, until I get a few more games under my belt.  I love the idea of this game, and the Flying Buffalo version is certainly nice (with the exception of a few hiccups), but the quality of the line drawings make it unnecessarily difficult to interpret the plane orientation.

This is great dogfighting fun that fits in your pocket.  (Well, if it's like one of those side pockets on cargo pants anyways.)  I can't believe I never tried this game until 2006!  I imagine one could grow tired of playing if you started to know the page results, but that would take a lot of play.   The basic rules and basic set seem to be the best.  I don't think adding rules is beneficial here.

I can't imagine anyone not liking this game at least a LITTLE bit.  Pulling off a good string of moves is VERY satisfying.

I've had this game for YEARS and I still dig it out for a bit of Snoopy and the Red Barron from time to time...

One of the most unique and brilliant games I've ever played, and I played it everywhere - in high school (writing page numbers on scrap paper & passing said paper halfway across the room during English class,if I recall correctly) in the Navy, over the phone, at college, with cousins at family reunions, with non-wargaming friends, and perfect strangers.  A wonderful way to introduce people to wargames.  Basic game learnable in about 2 minutes, but the advanced game wasn't nearly as much fun and lost much playability.  Follow-up games like Powerhouse of Flying Machines not as good, and the graphics look a little pathetic as I look back, but the original was a hell of a lot of fun.  Worthless solitaire. Sold years ago, to my everlasting regret.

Oh my gosh, this is so weird and fun. I know, this is something that computers could "fix" to make it easier, but you wouldn't believe how entertaining the system is once you get the hang of it (which doesn't take long).

When I got this game (in High School) I took it to class every day to play with a buddy.  He had the Powerhouse series and we had a great time mixing and matching the books.  The Handy Rotary and Powerhouse sets are simply fantastic, but are definitely best when both players have some clue as to what they are doing. Each of the books provide everything you need to play.  The rules are included as well as background information on the planes and pilots of the era.
The game itself is very simple, but can be spiced up a bit by the addition of altitudes, damage locations, and various other 'advanced' rules that come in a separate little booklet.

RATING: 10
One of the most original ideas to have ever graced the gaming world - two planes fight off each other guided by two players who see the position of the rival in the pages of a book. Choosing a concrete manoeuvre means both players flipping to a new page. The players (readers?) don't need a lot of time to get the basic game started... and many of them won't even bother learning the advanced game. It is really that engaging.

This first volume is almost unanimously considered the best of the series, with two relatively slow WWI planes that encourage flashier moves than the more powerful, later machines.

A game to play while relaxing in a comfy armchair! This is a wonderful old game that has now been reprinted. It was a long time in waiting for the reprint and at times I feared it would never happen, but it was well worth the wait.

The game consists of two leather bound volumes. One for the Ally and one for the Axis player. As you sit back and relax. You choose your move from the bottom of a page as does your opponent. Each orders the other to turn to another page to discover the outcome of your choice maneuver. You see a brief picture of what happens and must make a new maneuver. If you choose wisely you will hit your target plane a certain number of points. A stunning game that's clever and tactical.

Played a bit with a friend while idly watching sports, trying to outguess each players moves and doing mental gymnastic visualisations to get it right. It's a game that I'd like to like, because the book idea is very cool, with each person being given their view out the cockpit that resulted from the last combination of manoeuvres. But in practice, it's just a guessing game - how far will they turn and what speed, and therefore what should I do to get on their tail and/or have a shot, or should I try to escape. And then it's just calling out numbers to each other to get to the right pages, without a clear sense of actually going through the manoeuvres to get to where you are now. Unless you really work at visualising it I guess, but it's not intuitive.

Fun, simple game. Not necessarily a tactical challenge, but entertaining nonetheless. The picture based format is very cool and really brings the fight to life. On the other hand, I'm not convinced that random selection of moves won't produce the same results as tactical decision making...

Always an amazing system that does so much with so little. This charm means that it is at its best with just the basic rules.

The illustration and maneuver mechanics provide a very good sense of 'being there'. The 'tell your opponent the page number' part is a little clunky (especially to explain the first time), but is a good checksum that keeps errors down.

(And I'm still amazed that I've never heard of a single page number typo....)

WWI AVIATION CLASSIC 
I read about this game circa 1980 in Omni Magazine (back in the day Omni had an annual article about best games of the year).  The WWI air combat theme and innovative play made this a must buy.  I am sure that I played this game 200+ times back in the first half of the 80's and loved every minute of it.  I went on to purchase all the other Ace of Aces offerings as they came out.  If you are looking to lay hands on a copy I would seek out the Handy Rotary Series - it is the most fun, with Powerhouse a reasonably close second.  A couple of years back I taught my kids (then 7 and 10) how to play (basic game)in 15 minutes whereupon they promptly beat me.  It was real popular for about a week and then they lost interest.  I think the kids like shinier bits these days.

Own, but never played. Acquisition ala eBay. Two players dogfight using separate picture books. Cool concept, and the rules seem to allow for enough manuevering to make combat interesting. I look forward to playing with an opponent.

Quick and unique game that you can play pretty much anywhere. Has some flaws with it, but it is still a fun time killer.

Only really willing to play when I'm at a place where a board game isn't a choice (like at the movie theater), because it is still more fun than Eye Spy or Rock, Paper, Scissors or some random word game.

Innovative and a great game in its day. Lots of hours spent playing countless games. Unfortunately, the availability of good flight sims for computers has largely made the game a bit obsolete (maybe good as a travel game)

Each player has a book.  Each page shows a view from their airplane with a list of maneuvers along the bottom.  Pick a maneuver and tell your opponent what page they go to and they do the same.  The epitome of the first person shooter before the world ever heard the word 'Wofenstein 3-D'

Played this quite often with my best friend back in college... I'd always try and maneuver and jink about and he'd always win by always trying to just turn into me and shoot me :)  Taught me a lot about dogfighting that has helped a lot in my later computer game days, and indeed, life in general (i.e. don't get fancy, just try to kill them ;) )

I loved Ace of Aces back in high school, and I learned it on this edition. It has the elegance of an abstract, but it's well integrated with the WWI air combat theme. Limitation: in the Handy Rotary edition, the basic game is pretty much a solvable problem, and if you play "correctly" it is impossible to lose, and two players both playing correctly will always draw (or the game will last forever). This problem may be unique to the Handy Rotary series due to the particular maneuvers available.

Straight up: This is a cool concept.  Aside from it being a cool system, it's also impressive from a design standpoint.  I can't imagine how much effort it took to make this work, and I can't deny that it's a cool game to play.  It seems like it's prone to mistakes (we wound up on different pages, even after double-checking that we had followed the right numbers), and didn't even finish a complete game, but I liked what I saw.  It's definitely unique, if nothing else, and I liked that it would be possible to play this over a distance, so long as each player had his own book to play the game.

You can technically play with an almost unlimited amount of players in this game, as long as everyone has their own book and you are adept enough to keep the book pages correct.

For the past two WBCs I've entered the Ace of Aces tournament and don't get enough flights in to qualify. I always think I'll just fit them in. Got to make it more of a priority. I really like Ace of Aces a lot. I was 5-0 this year and shot down all of my opponents. But that's a far cry from the 15 necessary flights to qualify.

I enjoy this game a lot, and I also like the mechanics of it.  I'm not sure if it was the first game to use this system of determining where both planes (or characters) are after both simultaneously choose an action, but it was completely new to me when I first got the game in 1980.

My big complaint is that I can't find people who are interested in playing it with me.  I think the concept is simple, but the few people I've tried to teach usually glaze over when I try to explain it to them.

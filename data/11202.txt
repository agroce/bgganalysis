I would not not rate The First World War highly as published, but it clearly has potential to be a very good simple multiplayer and solo wargame, if slight rules modifications are made to their best advantage. We just need to find out what these are.

I just love it! Probably the Ted Raicer hidden masterpice!(And neither he must have awareness!)  A very simple wargame and ... A GREAT SIMULATION OF WW1 at strategic level!!
Expressions as: "Attaque à Outrance", "Shackled to a corpse", "The Ring of Steel", "War of Attrition", "Fronts", "Collapse of Empires" are wonderful and enjoyable embodied this title.
Great with two players and a Blast with four! And very solo friendly (without the dummies units).
I Would have given a higher note (10) was not the enigmatic rulebook and the gaps with the Brest-Litovsk Treaty.
As a POG player I rate this title as a much better simuation of WW1.
And I must be of the few that  agree with the horrific surrender rolls (Hey! this is WW1! and (S)hit happens!)
Plays Fast and without downtime. FANTASTIC!
A underappreciated masterpiece.
One session: 1 to 2:30 hours

Essentially a light and abstract WW1-themed game with good quality components. Grognards attracted by the Ted Racier design and who aren't looking for an introduction to eurogames are likely to be disappointed. Still I'd be willing to give it another try.

RATING: 3
Great components both board and token. 

After the first play, I just felt frustration as the game gives you no feel of the actual campaign. The left-right flow of the frontline tokens may mimic the battles but I just did not appreciate that too well. 

The end game was abrupt with no conclusion on the battlefield. 

The will be gamers that appreciate such wargames but I for one can't. 

One of 3 games I threw out the window.

The game works, but is really an abstract game with a WWI theme pasted upon it. The decoy armies also vanish too fast to have fog of war last more than one round of each year, and this leaves You with just one good way to play: roll that damned four and forget the rest.

Many of the negative comments don't "grok" the game, I feel. This game is all about bluff and using your dummy armies as fake reserves. You always want the +1 drm in combat for having more armies than your opponent, but how long can you keep turning over a new piece that's a real army?  Your opponent has to guess -- or take the offensive and force you to reveal your dummies on that front. Yes, the dice play a role, but this is a short game so I think that's ok.

If you are looking for a slightly shorter game covering WWI - this is a nice abstraction of the entire war in several theatres.  Game play is quick with a nice flavor.  The game can end early if a player makes a really bad move, especially if that player is Germany.  The first turn for the Germans is a bit odd, but subsequent turns are stronger.  Not as much feel of stalled lines as in Paths of Glory, but that might have more to do with the player strategies and not the actual game play.  As a 4 player game, it may be stretching.  Shows alot of promise as a 2 player modern wargame.

As is, this first is the worst WWI strategic level game I have played.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Updated. Played the game five times now. In reading the rules I was sceptical. Game seemed dry, but in playing it the first time, all the rules came together. 
Characteristics: short playing time (no more than 2 hours), a LOT of player interaction, hidden units, dice are used but strategic game play is possible, long term planning (resources)is needed, easy mechanics, no dice fest.
In short a perfect blending between a simple wargame and  Eurogame. I would even describe the game as a wargame since it IS linked to an historical flow and feeling. Components are first class.
Ted Raicer was known to put WWI back on the wargame scene, now he showed that he's more than a wargame designer. While the game doesn't have the same potential as that other golden Phalanx game (Age of Napoleon), it DOES show that a marriage between wargames and Eurogames is a new trend with great potential.
Finally, it scales good between 2 - 4 players.
I hope the game does get some coverage as it certainly deserves it.
In Essen it was kind of hidden on the shelves of 999 Games which was a sad thing.
It will certainly not have a lot of FAQ as the rules are written clearly and far better than Age of Napoleon (I only have the German rules though). English version should be out in december.
One negative remark: dummy counters are difficult to handle and turning those counters each turn IS a core. But game is unique in that it plays WW1 in just under 2 hours.

After one play... I admit, I approached this game with some trepidation: I feared yet another needlessly complex and picky treatment of an epic war in Europe. But what a great, compact, thematic, and thoroughly satisfying recreation of war along the three great, European fronts this is! The elegant and refreshing combat system recreates the war of attrition that plagued WW1 in Europe while also allowing for a bit of bluff and manuever-- all with with a 2.5 hour play time! Easily replaces SPI's "First World War" as amy favorite Great War title. A wonderful example of a true Euro-wargame!

The Great War stripped to its core. The system abstracts a lot but in the end here we have a both very playable (!) and plausible simulation of WWI.

The commentary on this one had led me to believe that it would probably suck, but that was not the case, and I modestly enjoyed my one play. That said, it wasn't great either, and I most likely won't play it again given the better stuff available.

The First World War is basically a game of bluff. You try to concentrate you armies at areas of enemy weakness and convince him not to attack in areas you are weak with lots of dummies. That's kinda cool, but that's really all there is - once you've made your comittments, it's very luck-heavy with high-stakes single die rolls and pretty obvious moves, and a game that will go 3 hours if it goes the distance. It's not without a fun factor - pushing around the armies and watching them advance or retreat is kinda neat - but if I want to play a simple game of bluff and deception, I'll play Quebec 1759 or War of 1812 instead, both of which are much more complete packages. Or Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation. None are WWI-themed, but The First World War isn't exactly dripping theme.

This is a game that suffers mainly in comparison. It isn't terrible, but there is a lot of better stuff to spend a couple hours on. As is often the case, I think it needed another idea. The stuff that's in there is okay, there just isn't enough. Being rules-light doesn't mean you need to be idea-light also.

I should also mention that I found the map amazingly unattractive. Phalanx is known for their high production values, and in many cases I'd agree (Revolution was amazing if played in good light, A House Divided and The Prince were both very nice, and most of the rest were at least above average in this category). But The First World War is unattractive in spots and overall is graphically ineffective, at best. Recent Phalanx games seem to have lost their edge in terms of physical attractiveness, without picking up any ground in terms of actual usability (which has always been a sore spot).

One last thing, while it's true that Paths of Glory is a great game and The First World War is not, the two are in totally different categories and gamewise, there just aren't any points of comparison.

The horrible surrender rule puts quite a dent into an otherwise playable design. 
Other than that, this is a fine 2- or 4-player game. Don't even bother playing with three, however - the blue Central Powers player has a near zero chance of winning. Why they didn't instead do CP vs Russia vs Western Powers is a mystery to us.

Want and expect to dig the game.... 1 painful learning session--I guess I didn't read the rules carefully enough, because it doesn't seem confusing to me now.  Who would have thought a beautiful WW1 game was possible? Well done. I don't like the counters though. I have been trying to make my own set (http://boardgamegeek.com/image/918307/coffeebike?size=original ).  My learning problems aside, I think I can see tough decisions and fast play here, if play smooths out. This has potential to be a good game for me. I like the scale, simplicity, fog of war, strategic quandaries, potential for multiplayer, quick game length.

Due to the dice conflict, I don't think of it as a eurogame, but an streamlined wargame in the tradition of Victory in the Pacific and War at Sea (which also dice over area control).

Note to self, surrender points on the track are cumulative, but surrender points on a front are not cumulative: only 1 max per front. Maybe there should be surrender markers for each nations' front to keep track. White cube on front?

Hexagonal bases cannot be captured. They represent national will as much as anything else. A successful attack (or just a potential attack if undefended?) on them inflicts a max one surrender point.

After 4 plays I think that the game delivers what it promises, don't buy it hoping for a new PoG. It's a simple but not semplicistic GAME with some IWW flavour thrown in.
It's (of course) luck oriented, but the good player will always prevail on the bad one. It plays in a 1 and half hour. My complains are for the long set up and for the rules about surrender.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unfortunately, this game is going to take a critical beatdown because it's a)not PoG and b)there is a dice element involved.  It's sad, because this is a good, accessible and quick-playing wargame that won't scare off new players or board gamers.  It's a game of bluffing and managing forces to attack or defend on different fronts without exposing vulnerabilities.  Luck is a big element (just like it is in almost all wargames) but as usual, judicious and smart play will mitigate bad rolling.  There's some really smart ideas here and the decisions and strategies are much more compelling than the last 10 or 15 Knizia/Kramer games to be cranked out onto the market.

Played twice, although the game ended on surrender rolls in Turn 1 both times - so will need further playing to confirm impressions.  Found it a good game, very brittle situation.  I don't know that it bears tremendous resemblance to the First World War as it is very abstract.  For all that, worth playing again as it is very quick and tense.

Later.. more games down and now I'm hooked.  It is doable in two hours if all players know the game.  Highly replayable, highly recommended.

Plays well with 4 players. The starting east-west balance for deployment of troops is critical for the Germans aka "Do I need to rush my troops back to defend Tannenberg?"

First play was actually much more fun than I expected based on reading the rules.  Sure, it's very dicey, but it plays smoothly and you do get to make enough dice-influencing decisions to make things interesting.  Also, the one-action-at-a-time sequence of play means there is almost no downtime, even in a 4-player game.

Our group consisted of two adults who play wargames and Euros, one adult who plays Euros and used to play some wargames way back when, and one 12-year-old Euro player who's just getting interested in wargames (hooray!), and we all enjoyed it.

It may run a little long for the average Euro gamer considering the amount of die-rolling involved -- around 2-2.5 hours once you know what you're doing, although it can also end very quickly if someone has an unlucky surrender roll.  (I like the variant people mentioned where you don't surrender until you fail *two* surrender rolls.)  On the plus side, the components (especially the map) are beautiful and functional.

While it's not terribly deep, I can definitely see this game hitting the table now and again.

RATING: 8
I've played Paths of Glory and War in Europe. I've played Ra and Caylus. I like The First World War by Ted Raicer!!

There's more depth to this little gem than just rolling dice and whining! The first game where we got into 1916 shows the tough decisions and suspense in this fun little system.

My only critique is that the surrender rolls are too easy to achieve. Our house rule is to force a surrender only after TWO failed surrender rolls. This allows most games to go well past 1916... I also like the variant where surrender rolls cancel out.

A really great game for an evening when you don't have the 12 hours to play Paths of Glory.

Recommended.

RATING: 5
A very light game that depicts the Eastern, Western and Balkan Front's of World War 1.  Units are armies, and armies exist in one of 11 "fronts".  The game lasts six turns (one turn per year, two turns in 1914), broken up into four rounds for each power in the game.  Each round a power can attack, move, redeploy or pass.  Attacks in a front advance the "line" up and down a linear track, and if you can push your opponent off the track (e.g. move past Calais in front 1) you inflict a surrender point on your opposition.  At the end of each turn, powers with surrender points roll a dice and may lose the game.  Very light on the rules, and very fast to play.  Captures nicely the feel of trying to win the war, but not lose it at the same time (you gain surrender points if you strip a front of armies).  Will not be for everyone, but I like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quick and light strategic journey.  Great components and fast game play.  This game does a good job of creating a system that allows you to play the entire war in one evening (sometimes more than once if a quick surrender is acheived).  The ending can be kind of anti-climactic, but otherwise a solid game.

I wasn't too impressed with the game. Although it manages nicely to simplify the otherwise sprawling conflict to a simple set of rules, it feels very random, as too much is dependent on simple dice rolls. The Austrian player has an especially hard time with his pitifully weak armies- in the first round it is virtually impossible for him to avoid a capitulation point, if he then rolls a "1" the game is already over in the first round!

A macro strategic game which might just become a template for a series of games treating other campaigns.  The object here is to replay a conflict in a couple of hours.  In that sense it is far more abstract than the more involved Paths of Glory, but it is still an interesting challenge to see of tight a rope you can walk.  Much is in bluffing astutely and picking your fights where you can do the most damage.  Fast-paced and intriguing in the sense that any given strategy depends on how much the opponent lets on.  Will get this and play it again for sure.

Interesting concept but way too random. The surrender roll decides the entire game and the rules give it so that you've got no incentive to protect fronts that already have a surrender roll generated on them this turn. So if things are going badly on a front it's better to remove all troops from it than to keep trying to hold it.

The combat counters and dummy units play way to small a part too. In the end there's simply not much of a game here. Don't think I'll play this again.

A decent wargame on a strategic campaign level.  A few drawbacks keep me from loving this game, such as you can only attack once or redeploy once on a turn.  So in the game we played about 3 or 4 of the 16 battle lines we in constant use (attack, redeploy attack, etc..) and the others were totally ignored.  Not because I didn't want to attack there but because you couldn't.  Also the number of troops available compared to the number of fronts is not very accurate.  Once you put one troop in each front you rarely have more than 2 or 3 left to use, thus severly limiting your strategic choices.

It has some interesting choices but the Central Powers need to be a little lucky to fare through the war and achieve a victory.

The representation of fronts is perhaps borderline interesting, but the historical railroading undermines most of the bluffing the design wants to encourage.

Based on one solo, one 2 player and one 4 player game.

Taken on its own merits (rather than as a quick-playing substitute for Paths of Glory which a number of people seem to do), this is a fun, tense, and quick-playing wargame.

The dice and chit draws add a lot of luck it has to be said, but there's a lot more strategy here than a quick play might suggest. You need do decide where to concentrate and attack when you have the initiative, and when/where to reinforce or let go when you don't.

The German player has the biggest decisions to make. Should he focus on the East or West front? Should he support the Austria-Hungarians by lending a unit or two for the benefit of the team, or hog all his units for his own ends, knowing that if the AH crumble, the game will be lost? Should he offer the Treaty of Brest Litovsk to allow the reallocation of his armies to other fronts, or continue to hit on the Russians in an attempt to force them to surrender?

All players have to decide whether to passively spread their units hoping to avoid surrender rolls, or concentrate with a view to a concerted push in one area.

I like it!

Great theme, fairly simple play, well-balanced. All in all, a winner. But something nags at me... It seems that the first turn surrender is more than just a theoretical possibility. Even under the stingiest and best-designed of defense, a string of bad die rolls can end the game quickly. When this unlikely event happens, you leave the table disappointed in what just happened. I want to get in a few more plays to convince myself one way or the other if there is something more here than meets my eye.

I like this game.  A "Euro-wargame" covering WWI in Europe.  The game system is simple but the game is not.  Ted Racier has designed an accessible treatment of "The Great War."
The only "fly in the ointment" is the Surrender rule which just doesn't sit well with me (or many other players).  The Surrender rule can make the game seem futile (hmmm, a comment on the war perhaps?) and a number of alternate Surrender rules have been proposed...  Despite the Surrender rule, this is still a fun and interesting game on World War One.  Recommended.

Game mechanic is very easy and it's very easy to... loose! You have to be very prudent and not to try to make onslaught on one front, beacuse this is the first and not the second wrold war... unlsess you use the surrednder variant posted here at BGG.
Anyway the fact to play on three different maps is very nice and fun. I'm now trying to find more game of Ted Raicer, designer of this game, still on 1Â° world war... I got more interested in this period...

Lightweight game more "Euro" than "war".  I like it for it's simplicity, bluff element and quick play time.  The is a tenseness at times as you weaken one area in order to try to attack or defend in another area.  Trying to mask your intentions yet accomplish your goals gives the game some measure of depth.  Fine for what it is.

Very fun game.  Needs a couple of house rule tweaks, but went over very well with my group.  However, after repeated play, the very high luck factor started to bother some of us.  Agree with the suggested tweak of treating "S" results as a roll of "1" to suppress some of the swings.  Also use the following variant for the surrender rule: Surrender points are cumulative, but there are no surrender die rolls.  If you reach four surrender points, your nation surrenders.  However, in any year in which you receive no new surrender points, your surrender level decreases by one.  This seems to work very well.

11/02/05 Received. The publisher/box says it takes 1.5 hours to play. Well, that's an average. It might take as little as 30 minutes or as long as 2.4 hours, depending on in which of the six turns someone surrenders. The map is an extremely murky dark brown. But then its largely irrelevant; only the front separators and the cities are of any import to actually playing the game. The one inch counters and combat chits are beautiful (standard for Phalanx). The seven pages of rules are all there, but I didn't think they were arranged as well as they could have been. The player aid card was merely OK. 

The dummy armies lend a nice touch of fog of war. Yet there should have been some difference in their front/back artwork. For you can tell if you look closely whether they're face up or face down due to the bevel of the counter sides. So if your opponent accidentally places them face up it nulifies the fog of war. 

The rules for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk are a can of worms, generating endless questions that, as of late 2009, have never been adequately answered. My view - just leave the treaty out of the game and save yourself a headache. Frankly I can't see a Russian player accepting it in a face-to-face match. I mean, who wants to basically sit there and do nothing for maybe an hour. With your fate totally in the other player's hands. 

The surrender rules drive some crazy. I'm fine with them. I think those that dislike them want to force the game to go on for many "years" just because the real war did. They forget in 1914 almost all experts expected a short war. And it could very easily have turned out that way. 

As of 08/30/15 I've played seven games, all four-player affairs, except one three-player game.

RATING: 8
Suffers from being a war-themed game with Euro-mechanics. Yet, this game of opportunistic bluffing combined with long-term strategy offers plenty of agonizing decisions in not so much playing time. A truly underrated gem, if somewhat hindered by the fact that four factions need to re-setup every year of the game, which generally takes a bit too long. However, creativity prevails in this game, contrary to the "processive" feel that many eurogames invoke - and that makes it stand out from the lot.
People complain about the seemingly luck-laden surrender rule, but there are plenty of variants to mitigate for that should one feel to change it. Otherwise, one could also approach the game in such a manner that leaving a front unattended is simply not an option, taking strategic precautions to prevent such a situation from occurring, and this is entirely possible to do.
This is pretty much strictly 2p, as the 4 different playing parties are not equally matched (although the 2 opposite factions are). This makes it much more interesting to play one of the bigger (Western Allied or Germans) parties than one of the smaller. People tend to be put off by this and (unrightfully) dismiss the game for it - do give it a try with just 2.
It should be noted that newbies often don't really know where to place their armies/dummies, which prolongs the game excessively. This is an annoying feature that is difficult to solve, since the "historical" setup is not that great, and subsequent placings will still take their time.
If you are able to get over this in addition to the absolutely horrendously written rulebook, you'll find a true gem underneath some of the blabber stated above - I'm glad I did.

RATING: 5
not as tense as Paths of Glory. Linear Front paths are OK, but the game lacked manoeuvre.
Allied strategy is to concentrate on either the German (likely in the initial turns) or the German Allies (after Italy enters the war and knock them out. German is very vulnerable in both replacement centres and bases to roll for surrender.

Combat system seems a little clunky and pro-Allied mass

I think this game does a wonderful job at briefly making the whole WWI playable from a grand strategic point of view. It's really a unique design and system, which still manages to catch the atmosphere of the conflict and reflects lots of the decisions each power faced. I don't really understand the low ratings here on BGG!

 I'm a fan of the First World War. This game is really ideal as a gift for the novice wargamers. By no means has this game got accuracy. But never the less this game is very much entertaining, with nice graphics, unit counters, fine looking map & a superb packaging. This game is ideal when you have less time to think too much & you wish to simply have a quick rundown of a historic event. Still worth keeping in my gaming collection & playing it maybe several times a year.

Love the components.  Like the game for what it sets out to do.  I have some minor quibbles about the unit ratings (BEF keeps coming back; the MEF and Army of the Orient both 1 point too high IMHO).  I'm not a fan of instant surrender mechanics based upon a die roll - ditto for Napoleonic Wars and Wellington.  Find a better mechanic (maybe an extra VP instead of a surrender flag) and I'd add two point to my rating.  Still, WWI in two hours ain't bad.

A very enjoyable and quick game. Interesting choices to be made. Components are top notch: counters are 1", thick and look nice. There's a neat little FOW element.

Very disappointing. Simple abstract game of bluff - and a rather boring one. Why this game is spiffed up with a WW1 theme is simply beyond me. Almost gave it a 1, but I admit it's not broken. The Emperor is just wearing nothing at all.

When playing this for the first time I couldn't believe it, I thought I surely must have missed some important mechanic or rule, but after playing it with gaming friends of my trust and confidence this was the first game I commited to the trash bin shortly after aquisition, because I couldn't think someone up to give this away as a present without ending up on the embarrassed end.

Interesting for a lite war game.  It's nice to see a game on WW1, and this one is O.K.  but it seemed like there were some flaws if your looking for a challenging play every time.  The surender rules are interesting , but I feel like they should only come into effect after rnd 3.  Also, I found the special chits to be distracting and not very useful.  Historical set-up needs some rules, as it is not hard for Russia to take Berlin, and the optional rule of Germany not fighting on the eastern front till turn 3 might make a more strategic game.

I don’t often give games a rating on the first go, but since I’m quit convinced I won’t play this again I will have to do just that. The game is trying to be a whole lot of things, but it doesn’t succeed in any of the areas. I can live with the sudden death element that’s tucked into the game. In fact I love that. But that is not the focal point of the game. The game is about bluffing, and that is where it fails. Why on earth would you want to care about just how many counters someone stacks against you in a sector? It’s not like the 3 three armies you are ]bringing in to the fight will [u]all[/u] contribute more weight to the 1-0 combo your opponent just brought up… Oh wait… I’m sorry, you get a +1 on the die role… and what is that thing there besides the counters… oh that could be a +2 or a 0 bluff counter (the round ones)… interesting…so now I’m scared and want to call of the attack, because I think you are not bluffing… What’s that you say… I can’t pull out my forces? Oh… oh, okay… so why exactly should I care what the marker could be then? This is just one example from the many I have collected over the course of this one play. In what could have been a nice game, Phalanx just overplayed its hand once more.

Edit: removed the rating, though still dislike the game

[5 plays]  This will likely always play with a high level of luck dependence. However, it is fun and well paced. I liken the level of emotional investment I place in this game to Battle Cry or Memoir '44 style games. A player can influence their fate only to a light extent, and then the rest is up to the dice. 

It is a beautiful game, although the compartmentalized map is off-putting when first experiencing the game. I enjoy the theme, the bluffing, and the ability to play out a simplified version of WWI in less than 2 hours.

Interesting game, though too abstract for a wargame. I picked it up for 17 Euros and it's definitly worth that. Winning the game is both dependent on luck in dice rolls and skill to bluff your opponent.

I once played it with 3 other players  and the game was very lighthearted (i.e. we were having lots of fun); it think this is good, and nothing against the game, but I think WWI is a little inappropriate for such a light game. Note that WWI is only used as a "theme", don't try to recreate history with this game.

Finally giving this away. I had fun plays with it, I had tense plays with it, it would certainly be worth keeping, but I don't think I'll play it again in the near future.

From the same genius of Ted Raicer a very well done and very funny game about World War I. Incredible funny if played at 4 players. Allied players (CP and AP).....are not very allied and this is one of the best thing of the game. You can play a couple of games in a evening session. For those who thinks AHungharians not competitive...I have won couple of times with them.
Fun fun !!

After five plays I still like it and it has proven being a great game to introduce occasional gamers to 'wargames'. And yes, sometimes all of a sudden one surrenders, but with some strategy you can avoid getting the surrender flags. If you're out of possibilities to avoid the surrender flags, you're probably on the way to a certain loss anyway... All in all an odd euro-wargame hybrid, and more strategic than it seems after first play. Some luck and bluffing keeps this game on the lighter side of wargaming. Phalanx delivered superior quality of components, as they always do.

Sorry, but no. The map and counters are beautiful, great designer, but not much of a game. I found the tracks to be a good idea, but the gameplay was to mimimalistic for me. The options were too few, and the gameplay too repetitive. The surrender point system is harsh (apparently not the designer's idea), and should have been replaced by some other way of preventing sides from abandoning a theatre.I feel that a game that was just a little bit more complicated could have made for a much more interesting game. At the same time, I do bring it out from time to time just because it is this simple to get into.

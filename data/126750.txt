RATING: 3
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I really don't get what the point here is. Sky Tango might be portable, fast and nice-looking but it also doesn't offer any choice whatsoever. You can just draw a bunch of cards and line them up following numbers, hoping to get what you want... and in my case what I want is for this game to finish FAST.

Really shallow, flimsy and forgettable game. Moving on!

Nice game. Played a few times before my great addiction started. We need to give it another try, I suppose.
I think, I like making sets and making nasty things to other players from time to time :)

I've got a soft spot for aesthetically beautiful, simple card games like this one...what can I say? You are lining and collecting rows of 5 or more Sun or Moon cards in a numerical order, but can break the rows with Eclipse cards to score them, and I like that a card placed with an animal on it lets you continue your turn. Also comes with a team 4-player variant. Simple art is beautiful, the narrow cards look great, and while some might complain that there isn't much here, that's part of its charm, that elegance.

Sky Tango is a beautiful looking little card game that is a bit similar to Balloon Cup in a way. You have both sun cards and moon cards which are shuffled together and dealt 5 to each player, then on your turn you either place a card or clear a card row away. You are trying to get your cards in increasing number order from left to right, and can also place cards that are not helpful to you in front of your opponent. You may only clear a row away once there are 5 consecutive cards. If you play a card with a bird or butterfly you must place an additional card. Eclipse cards can be used to cover your opponents cards or your own to give yourself more leeway. Your hand of cards is only refreshed once your hand is empty at the beginning of your next turn.

I loved everything about the cards from the colour choices, to the striking silhouette effect, to the slim line unusual shape. It comes in a standard Z-MAN card box though, which is WAY too large for it. The premise was interesting and the game played fine with 2, but it seemed to be quite card dependent and I think maybe the 4 player partnership game might be more interesting and give you a lot more options. As your hand is only refreshed when empty, if the other player has a lot of animal cards and can play their hand out faster then you can then you have no real chance to catch up. You also never wanted to leave your cards out beyond 5 cards as it was sure to be messed with by your opponent. A peaceful card placement and light press-your-luck filler, but Kanagawa scratches that itch much better for us and has a little more decision space.

An interesting nature theme, neat card shapes, and attractive art set the stage for this light card game.  I found the 4 player team variant to be worthwhile as well.  It's not the strongest game in Z-man's deluxe card game lineup, but it is quite overlooked and is worth adding to your collection.  You may be surprised at what's here.

RATING: 8
This is a beautiful card game that can get deceptively vicious. It seems at first that each player will just be doing their own thing, but no, you will definitely be messing with each other. I also like how the simple and straightforward rules put the players in tough situations. Playing another card after playing one with an animal on it seems like always a good thing but nope, it can really bite you. And the endgame is especially tricky and full of tough choices. This is just a stellar game. It plays up to four, but it seems to me that it's perfect with only two.

More fun than I expected.  I had this for a while and just didn't get it to the table.  It is small so I threw it in my bag for games over vacation and it was really played a lot.  Strategic enough to be interesting and fun while simple enough to get new people interested and playing with ease.  (and it is beautiful in a 70's way too)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Since the game was so inexpensive I ended up getting a copy, but after a second play realized that I didn't enjoy the mechanics of the game. I really enjoy trying out new card games, but they need to stand out to find a place in our collection. The game had some interesting scoring mechanics (needing to get at least 5 cards in a row before scoring), but the amount of randomness in the game really detracted from the experience. I'd play it again and the artwork is amazing, but we have too many excellent card games in our collection to keep one that is just okay.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]The art is awesome, I am really glad it they didn't change it for the US release. This is a great, quick playing card game that plays fast and has some take that since you can interrupt the other players melds they are building. 

What separates this game from other card games is how the scoring works. Basically you need to have at least 5 cards in a row on the table before you can score; however you can only draw new cards when you empty your hand of all 5 cards. This creates some awesome tension for a game with such a simple rule set.[/i]

Neat artwork but the game just doesn't seem to be tight. Played a 3P game and after shuffling the deck once, only one player had managed to clear one set of cards. Others just kept going through total eclipse.

Sky Tango is a pretty enjoyable game, but it's a bit too mean and swingy for us. I'm also not a fan of how many points can get lost at the end simply due to the luck of the draw or negative interaction from your opponent. It usually leaves me with an unsatisfied feeling so I decided to let it go.

A cute-looking solitaire type of game where players take turns to play a card in front of themselves or other players. The aim is to create sequences of cards to score and remove from play. Being unable to place a card is painful, but useful in the late game as cards left in front of you count negative. Being able to stymie another player creates plenty of “take that” opportunities. Lovely art, nice price, small box and cards sized to annoy sleevers; a winning combination.

Slightly disappointed by unresolved rules ambiguities.

Not only a very pretty game, but a surprisingly good play.  So far we've only played with two and have enjoyed that.  It's an easy going game on the surface, but that doesn't mean it can't have its confrontational side.  Nicely done.

The 4 player rules felt a little like an afterthought; as though the designer discovered it didn't work with more than three, but needed to sell it as a 4 player game. As such, I don't think it is at its best with 4. I'd like to try it again with 3.

It's an OK game. When you have a full hand, you have some interesting choices, but when you're down to one or two cards, there is usually just one choice of where to play it, so it doesn't really feel like a game at that point.

The game with two is decent but end game rules really but a damper on the overall quality of the game play. If the rules are clarified, I might reconsider my ratings.  As it stands, it is unclear whether one can perform a total eclipse when end game is triggered with no cards in the card deck and no cards in hand? This is a crucial difference as getting zero negative points can wildly swing the game. By itself, the game is generally harmless and not particular taxing. It is likely to garner a 6 on my scale if not for end game scenarios. The art is nice but not necessarily stunning. 
I do think this game is is one of the weakest in the Z-man series of small card games thus far without any rule clarification.

RATING: 6
I almost traded this game away without playing it because it sounded TOO simple to even give it a shot.  That would have been a silly mistake.  Sky Tango sure is silly, you can explain the rules within a minute, but there's a deceptive amount to think about.  You have a had of 5 cards that you HAVE to be able to play or you'll lose all progress in front of you.  The order you play your cards is very important, but is also contingent on what your opponent is playing.  The Eclipse cards double as Take-that cards, or for strategic re-arranging of your string of cards.  

The take that isn't too bad since it's pretty expected and it's something you have to always be planning against, if you have a spread of 5 cards in a broad range, you have to try and not leave yourself open for long, or gauge your opponents hand.  Lot of fun stuff like that for a super light, 20 minute game.

Sky Tango is an ok game.  It's saving grace for me is that it does interest new gamers into the hobby because it is relatively simple to grasp the gameplay.  What I don't like about it is that you are so limited to what your hand gives you.  I realize this is important but you can be screwed by random chance.  Also, the strategic choices aren't there...you pretty much always can tell what the best move is.  I don't dislike the game, but I don't like it.  For the MSRP, it is not worth the price for the quality you get components wise.

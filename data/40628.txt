Upgraded to (9) after a few more plays. One of my fav 2 player games, brilliant. Still prefer Cinque Terre but they do scratch a diff itch and there is the time factor.

I found it very dull, and I was expecting a strategy game when in fact it is almost 100% tactical.  You can't plan ahead because your available moves are dictated by what everyone else does.  It is really just pick up random fruits then see which cities you can deliver to.  Yuck.

Light set collection game with an interesting if not original rondel mechanic.

The goal of the game is to amass fruits (generally different types) and then "sell" these fruits to local villages in order to obtain victory points.  Obviously theme is irrelevant, but gameplay is simple and fairly decent.  You have three choices on your turn: 1) move a worker on the windmill (rondel) and collect the corresponding fruit, and this is where most of the interaction/planning occurs, as you can only move the number of spaces clockwise based on the number of workers on your current space (similar to "That's Life!"), and you collect a number of fruits equal to the number of workers on the space you land on, 2)play a donkey tile or deliver fruits to the villages, and you are limited to delivering a max. of 6 fruits.  You need to match your types of fruits to the types required by the villages and score points accordingly, and 3)play a bonus tile (each player has the same ones, there are 4 different ones), which give a one-time special ability.

Once a set number of villages have satisfied their "fruit quota" or in other words all fruit tiles have been awarded, the game ends.  Scoring occurs when a village fruit tile is acquired, when a set of numerical fruit tiles is obtained, and when a village runs out of fruit demand (tile awarded based on fruit majorities).  Any bonus tiles not played are worth a minimal amount of points, so make sure to remember to play them!  One interesting twist/dirty trick is that whenever there is not enough of fruits/donkeys in the supply, EVERYONE has to put ALL of their matching stuff back into the supply, and the player who initiated this then collects their goods.  

All in all, a simple, light, decent game with some mild strategy, and a very wife friendly game.  Seems to scale decently as well (2-4), although I have only played 2 and 3 player.  

Own the [boardgame=70463]El Razul[/boardgame] mini-expansion.

This wasn't my cup of tea theme-wise, but I did like the game and the game play. Watch out for anyone AP prone, as examining the board and the windmill make them susceptible to some delay, but it's certainly not that bad.

The art is nice and pleasant -- I'd call it serene. I tend towards being a player who becomes immersed in theme very easily (much to my liking), so I found this rather relaxing to be honest. I almost felt the wind in the hair that I used to have many years ago. 

:)

Update: This is possibly one of my favorite two player games. I'm working on getting a solo variant for this together at some point soon. It's really a great way to spend time in a relaxing setting. That part certainly hasn't changed.

Update: Solo variant done.

Good gateway game, which essentially boils down to set-collecting to score victory points. This would be very generic if it wasn't for the rather interesting (although by no means unique) rondel. Players move their player pieces around a circular track to claim resources, and lots of strategy derives from this aspect of the game. The theme never really comes through, despite the extravagant components and it feels like a fairly simple exercise, but it's not without decisions. This game sits comfortably alongside Carcassonne, Vikings, Takenoko etc. as a quality light-strategy game.

RATING: 6
1 play / 2 players

LIKE: The subtle interactions and race conditions make the game interesting. Planning out the rondel and competing for the next finca tile that will score keeps pressure on the players. I enjoyed the action tiles to break the rules.

DISLIKE: Some randomness in how the tiles come out. When a "1" delivery tile appears, it is easy to jump and grab it by another player.

OVERALL: I think it may be more interstin gwith more players, but bordering on chaotic.

Ordered from Italy. Made it here ok! Bella!

Good fun in 45 minutes, as advertised. The heart of the game is working the rondel -- the deliveries seem almost secondary, although I'm sure things will catch fire when the two gears fully mesh. Screwage in 2p seemed almost accidental. Possible gateway -- with only three actions to choose from on your turn, it hardly couldn't be.

A game of... fruit.  And donkeys... that deliver fruit.  Does that sound a little weird to you?  Good, it should.

The worker movement mechanism is very interesting.  It can lead to patterns and provides a good bit of player interaction.  Other players and their movement directly affect your options and choices.  (This is a good thing.)  The rules for a limited supply provide further player interaction.  That is to say, none of your choices are made in a void.  You will, or should, always be cognizant of the other players and their actions.

The obtaining and usage of the donkeys is a small, nice limitation.  The special actions are excellent as a further cost/benefit consideration.  Use them to increase your ill-gotten gains, but lose points in the process.

I like this game but it's short and not all that deep.  You can try to pursue something akin to a strategy, but it all comes down to what the other players do.  So many of your choices are dependent on them that the game feels murky and non-linear in almost any respect.  This is good and bad, I just happen to think it dilutes any larger or overarching goal.

I will gladly play this one, but I don't feel any strong urge to play it repeatedly or to pick up a copy of my own.

Finca is a nice, elegant little game.

It's pretty abstract and somewhat chaotic. But it's charming! I've had a lot of success in introducing many different types of gamers and non-gamers to Finca.

I think that Finca exceeds the sum of its parts in the fun department. It's a feel good-game, but not something you want to bite into if you're looking for deeper strategy.

Familiar con una mecánica de selección de recursos muy chula: una rueda, que simula un molino, donde tendrás que poner a tus trabajadores. Éstos podrás moverlos tantos espacios como meeples haya en el aspa donde te encuentres y cogerás tantos recursos como meeples haya en el aspa donde termines tu movimiento. Escala muy bien aunque a dos jugadores es todo bastante más controlable que a 4.

2-4(2)

A pretty nice tactical game with very nice components. It's very tactical in that, often enough there will be a move that will net you some fruit. Beyond that, though, you have to be aware of the different fruits you are collecting and preventing killer moves for your opponents. It is interesting how the "wild" tiles are pretty key in getting the 1-6 set bonuses, but generally useless in getting the finca tiles. All this is sort of just what it is, but there is some interaction in forcing players to dump their fruit (often a lot) and, more significantly, their donkey tokens, potentially screwing players out of planned deliveries.

This has been compared to Jaipur, and indeed it is. Small differences in how resources come out and deliveries are fulfilled. I think I like Jaipur a bit better for what it is.

Finca is a touch light, and the map completely extraneous, for a board game like this. Still, not a bad play.

I really wanted to like... no, love this game. It's got all the gateway appeal I adore to bring new people to the hobby, and the "fruiteeples" are just awesome.

Sadly, in the end, this is just another set collection game, with not much new going on. Sure, the windmill mechanics are, if not innovative, at least somehow fresh. But that alone doesn't make a game, and it seems the designer wanted to do so.

On the other hand, a game as simple as this should not have so many choices available, in my opinion. Each turn you must decide from a wide array of 10+ actions, most of which result in more or less the same benefit (comparatively).

I do enjoy the windmill actions, but the rest of the game is only "meh" for me.

I originally bought this game because I fell in love with the colorful wooden fruit and because it plays great with 2 players (it's often just my hubby and me). Then I found out how much fun the windmill mechanic and loading my donkey cart was and now it's one of my favorite games. 

We usually play with 2 players but have occasionally played with 3. It requires a little more planning with 3 but it's still just as much fun to play.

RATING: 7.5
One of the lightest heavy games you'll ever play.

What I really like about it, is you can think as much or as little as you like on this game.  So it's really accessible to the guy who wants to play a heavy game, and also the friends who just want to have a good time.  It's rare to find a game that allows that.  It explains easy, it plays easy.

There have been some comparisons to ticket to ride.  I don't disagree totally here.  You collect items, and you complete deliveries.  However, you can't really block someone else from completing a delivery, and the methods for bending opportunity are obvious to everyone playing from the word "go".

While I'm not finding it to be a game I'm thinking about and obsessing over a ton, it's a very accessible game that i can see coming to the table a bunch, which is worth a good +1 to whatever rating I would give it.  

Update:  downgraded to a 7.5 (6.5 +1 for accessibility) after I've just plain played this game too much (seriously, about 10-15 times...straight.  That is, no mix-ins of other euros and wargames)   Although, the main reason I've played this so much, is that it's our euro of choice when it comes to introducing non-linear games with more than 2 players to friends and family.  Easy to grasp, and deceptively shallow.  It's truly a work-of-art game in that respect.

9-16-11 update:  I'm kind of, overall, just bored.   That said, it might have a lot to do with my new gaming partner, a 4-month-old.  I don't really get to enjoy subtlety quite like I used to.  That, and the 4-player can be pretty darn chaotic to deal with.

Fairly light tactical set collection game. A real abstract at it's heart but fun nonetheless. The token collection mechanic with the weel is original and works really wel. The variable setup ensures enough replayability to ensure a lot of fun plays. Good family game.

After repeated plays it has lost a lot of its appeal for me. Not really sure where the problem lies but most games seem a bit samey. That and the fact that luck plays a larger role than I would like have lowered my enjoyement of the game.

The rules are dead simple to learn and the game races by really fast. But it feels like there's a good amount of strategy to satisfy gamers too. I am surprised how little analysis-paralysis there is even though board situations can change dramatically from one turn to the next. There have been moments while playing Finca where I look around the table and see everyone staring intently at the board planning out their next moves and I realize...we're hooked! Now it's worth mentioning that the game has teeth and can be quite nasty.  You can grab tiles you know another player wants, and you can totally hose people by clearing out one type of fruit.  But even with the nastiness it's still a lot of fun.  My only complaint is the difficulty of differentiating some of the different fruits. People sometimes have a hard time remembering which one is a fig, an olive, or an almond. The color-coding helps a lot, but it might take a couple games before new people have nailed down which fruit is which. A pretty minor complaint about a very good game.

RATING: 6.75
This game combines a rondel movement system with collection and delivery of goods to fulfill contracts and then a simple majorites type of game for bonuses. All of the parts fit well together. There is some randomness in the setup; so it is virtually impossible for two games to play out the same way. It is easy to explain and scales well from  2-4 players. All in all a very well done game that plays easily in under 45 minutes.

What a magnificent family game.  It's very, very simple and my 6 and 8 year olds are enjoying "the fruit game" quite a bit.  The colorful fruit grabs their attention and they are thinking hard through their turns.  We played a half game that ended early for bedtime, but whet their appetite.  The next night we played a full game and they were into it.  Next time, they'll play with the player tiles and we won't (we didn't use them in our first game).

Simple format.  You can do one of three things during your turn, but it gets much more complex from there.  I think it's great that everything is random, so the game changes every time.  This game wasn't even on my radar, but a friend bought it and I'm glad he did.

The rules are easy to explain and understand, with 2 players you can win by thinking but with 3 or 4 it's totally growing to chaos due to other players moves can change everything before your turn comes again. Gamers often will hate Finca but as a family game is an enjoyable pretty game.

RATING: 6.5
An unusual (and abstract) economic game that includes set collection, area majority and a rondel.  Feels okay or good but not great.  The game is an enjoyable race (of set collecting) even though a lot can change between turns and the movement on the rondel feels forced.  The rules are simple and straight-forward, and there is a good amount of turn angst, especially when certain fruits are running low and might trigger a recall.

** UPDATE: I'm starting to sour a bit on this game (especially with 4 players).  The winner seems to be decided more by luck & randomness than skillful play.  Players must work together to ensure that no single player gets too many of the fruit majority bonuses and runs away with the game.  This game has the simplicity of a gateway game, but I'm afraid that there will often be runaway leaders in games with newbies or inattentive players.  Furthermore, the amount of luck in the delivery tiles makes the game less interesting for experienced players. **

TRADE DESIRE: low.

RATING: 7
Dead simple concepts with some potential for though behind it means that Finca is good for family/non gamers, but gamers can get in to it as well. You basically collect fruit by moving one of your 4 pieces round a "windmill" rondel arrangement or you deliver fruit to areas on the board in quantities that match what is shown on each areas face up tile. There's some bonus tiles and some set collection and the evil option of forcing everyone to return all their fruit of one type if there's not enough in the supply to accomodate your demand, but that is basically that, get fruit or deliver fruit.

RATING: 9
It is simple to play with wonderful bits and a very fun rondel mechanic.  Everyone that I teach to play this game really enjoy it.  There are times when the guy to the right of you can really make or break your turn on the rondel, but everyone typically has those same situations occur so it balances out. This is a perfect gateway game to set-collecting Eurogames.

A very fun and interactive boardgame, good for parties/fun. What makes it fun is also what makes it hard to enjoy. The fun is that every move of yours is very much dictated by everyone else's turns. The problem is, this makes it very hard to try to plan anything in advance. I don't mind this for a game or so, but I wouldn't want to play this often because the lack of any long-term strategizing.

RATING: 3
Very pretty to look at, and thankfully short ...

Not a game I liked at all - too tactical (there's very little planning you can do, just optimise your turn, and most of what you can do is heavily influenced by what others can do, mostly incidentally).

I won, but didn't really care. Immediately forgettable, very dry (it's just an abstract - the mechanics don't really match the theme, why are you walking around the blades of a windmill, and why does what you collect depend on what others are there and how far you can then move ... are they getting together to throw you?? All makes very little sense).

So, too dry, too chaotic, not enough strategy for my tastes, can see why others love it ... I don't. At all ... after my second play I'm even more negative than before, nothing here that makes me want to try it a third time.

I continue to like this game more and more.  It's definitely a modern euro where players are moving around a track to collect fruit to complete orders to get points.  There are several different ways to get points, including completing runs, completing "most of" goals and focusing on getting high value "orders".  There's also a variable end-game that lets players push the game if they want.  

This was the first euro I taught my kids and it's still one of my daughter's favorites.  It plays great with 2 (and 3 -- I've only played with 4 once or twice) and with 2, it only takes 30 - 40 minutes.  Perfect!

Los jugadores se convierten en campesinos de Mallorca. El objetivo es repartir frutas y diversos productos por distintos distritos de la isla. Tiene un sistema de movimiento y obtención de recursos bastante novedoso y curioso. Yo al menos no conozco otro juego que se le parezca en ese aspecto. Cada jugador controla tres peones (número variable según el número de jugadores, pero a cuatro eran tres peones). Pues bien, estos peones se van a mover en circulo sobre las aspas de un molino, en sentido de las agujas del reloj. Cada peón moverá hacia adelante tantas posiciones como el número de peones (incluido el mismo) que había en la casilla de la que parte y cuando llegue a la aspa destino (cada aspa tiene dibujado un tipo de producto) obtendrá tantas unidades de producto como peones haya en dicho aspa (incluido el mismo). Es realmente original, aunque bastante dificil de controlar y casi imposible de planificar a medio plazo, porque desde que juegas una vez, hasta el turno de movimiento siguiente, la disposiciones de peones sobre el molino puede haber cambiado por completo.

Además, en el movimiento sobre las aspas de molino, al atravesar dos marcas dispuestas al efecto, el jugador puede obtener burros. Los burros permiten transportar las mercancías obtenidas a los distintos distritos. En cada distrito hay una pila de losetas de las cuales, la superior está dispuesta boca arriba y muestra una combinación de productos. El jugador que lleve esos productos a ese territorio gana esa loseta que pasa a su poder y se descubre una nueva loseta. Cuando todas se acaban, hay una loseta especial de finca, que muestra un tipo de producto. Esa loseta irá a parar al jugador que tenga en las losetas que ha obtenido, mayoría de unidades de ese tipo de producto.

Me pareció un juego entretenido y bastante sencillo de explicar y jugar. Las pegas que le veo es que resulta un poco caótico, por el tema del movimiento de peones. Además, a cuatro jugadores, es muy probable que alguien consiga la loseta a la que tu le habías echado el ojo antes de que te vuelva a tocar.. lo que hace que sea muy dificil plantificar los turnos siguientes.

RATING: 6
Beautiful game, but too chaotic for my tastes -- definitely a game of tactics rather than strategy.  The quasi-rondel uses a mechanism similar to that in Downfall of Pompeii (you move the number of spaces equal to the pawns on your starting space), and deliveries remove the demand from the board, so it's difficult to plan even for your next turn.

RATING: 8
A nice set collection game, with little luck. The movement of the meeples on the windmill is a really interesting.

There are basically two ways to score better than your opponents: Collecting more fruits (and donkey carts) than anyone else by clever meeple movement, so that you can deliver more often while spending less turns collecting. And second, getting the various bonus tiles (the ones for having the most fruits of certain kinds when emptying a stack and the ones for having one of each tile numbered 1-6.) This makes an interesting race, where you have to balance collecting many fruits with collecting the right kind of fruits before your opponent does.

Wonderful little Euro, desperately in need of a reprint. The game is light and fast, but decisions are tricky, and the game never overstays its welcome. 

I love the variation of the rondel, which not only restricts your available actions, but also changes your priorities depending on the position of both your and your opponents' pieces: you not only need to take advantage of new opportunities as they present themselves on the rondel, but you also need to be careful not to set up your opponents on their turn. The result is a brilliant little game, simultaneously light and simple yet tough, tense, and intensely competitive.

Simple rules but lots of time spent analyzing the board, opponents' pieces, figuring out timing, etc. to optimize your score.  I just don't like that kind of game that much anymore.  For me, a game either needs to be simple enough that everyone can optimize their turn in less than a minute or complex enough that people can't optimize their turn in a reasonable amount of time so they don't bother trying and just "go for it".  Finca is in the zone I don't like: simple enough that everyone is capable of optimizing their turn, but complex enough that determining the optimized move takes several minutes per turn, and your ability to plan ahead is limited, so the game drags.  Probably best as a two-player game to limit the downtime and board changes between turns.

Finca is pretty decent as a family type game, but isn't really anything mind-blowing.  It basically uses a rondel-type system where you collect goods, and then you cash in those goods when they match the goods depicted on various delivery tiles.  Overall, the game is extremely tactical.  It's similar to Alhambra in that you don't want to play it with more than 3 players really since board position becomes a real crap shoot with more.

I thought/hoped I would enjoy this game more than I do, but I guess the hype about it was too big when it was out of print; now that it is reprinted and I got a copy, I don't think it's as awesome as many people claim. Sure, it's a good lightweight game, but I guess I think it's just too light and if I am going to play a light game I would much prefer Stone Age or something similar which isn't that much harder to learn. The rondel mechanic is obviously nice and it's cool when you can force other people to lose their fruit! I guess that my expectations were too high, but it's still a game that I will play with new/younger players!

First play as a 2-player. Pleased. Components are a blast. Production and tight design really captured my imagination. I had resisted rondels because they are black holes for theme, but this was fine because it's light and breezy. Looking forward to more plays. 

*** 

11/2017 - After years on the bench, we broke it out tonight over the Thanksgiving Break. Even though it was late at night, we played again right after the first game. I forgot how much I love this! Quick turns, many approaches to each turn. We didn't talk much because we were so focused on gameplay, but it was enjoyed by everyone at the table. Really think this clean Euro-design belongs in almost every collection. Would break this out with almost any group.

Great simple game! There's not too much involved in the game and it has a good theme to fit family game nights as well as gamers.

Rated "6" after one play. My first game featuring a rondel, and I'm not sure what to think. The game is gorgeous. I love the fruitmeeples, and the artwork is great. I'm just not sure what I'm doing in the game. Why are my guys moving around this wheel? And what does that have to do with delivering crops? 

The game feels a little abstract, and it actually is a little too nuanced to be a straight family game with more obvious paths to victory. I wanted to like this more than I eventually did.

It was heavier than I thought, and I found myself paralysed when presented with a range of poor choices. I love the resource collection mechanic, but was pretty dissapointed with the points scoring mecahnisms. Perhaps I'm getting fussy in my old age, but it seemed like someone had a good idea and then strapped on a bunch of stuff around it and called it a game. A little disspointed, but my game design brain loved the rondel / meeple mechanic for collecting fruit.

A simple - yet highly-enjoyable - introduction to farming-based Euro games. The use of randomised windmill blades, and location of competing farmers, to determine produce earned each turn is a stroke of genius. Not at all fiddly, which makes it an ideal entry point into gaming.

Short and knifefighty.
45 mins of abstract movement game and set collection game, fused together really nicely.

The board is lovely but it does tend to camouflage the tiles. It's hard to read the state of the game with a quick glance.

Tis a great game, and I think I'll like it a lot, but it will never make me laugh.

I mostly play two-player games.  At first, it was a simple set-collection game with some interesting decisions on the rondel.

Then we read the variants section and removed fruit so that there was only 8 of each in the general pool.  What had been a light breezy affair became a cutthroat competition for scarce resource and, in effect, made the decisions on the rondel much more sweat-inducing.  Now one must really decide if they want to play offense or defense to protect their supply, kill the opponents fruit bonanza, or set themselves up to deliver that load.  It becomes much more difficult to score that 6 fruit tile with these kinds of shenanigans afoot.

Finca is a nice little filler game. It is easy to learn and fast to play. The randomness increases strongly with the number of players but due to the simple mechanism Finca is not a game that demands much thinking. For me this is the typical type of game that I like to play intuitively without much planning ahead. The game components are very colourful and come in the usual high quality that you expect from Hans im Glück games. Especially the wooden fruits are a real eye catcher. Of course, the theme is completely arbitrary as the mechanism has absolutely nothing to do with producing or delivering. So after all this is not a game I am likely to play but I would recommend it to everyone looking for a light and short game that will also be great (and more strategic) to play with 2 players. (This is for the German Hans im Glück (2009) edition.)

RATING: 8
Excellent family game with great components!  Worked very well with my 8 y.o. and my 5 y.o. was also able to play along with a bit of help.  I love the windmill mechanism, the open information, and the ability to try to plan ahead to set yourself up to collect the bonus tiles makes for some great game endings.  My only minor quibble would be with the board -- slightly larger would have been nice, and the fruit tiles can be a bit hard to distinguish against the same colored background.  All in all a hit for the family, though!

RATING: 6
I'm not sure if collecting fruit isn't perhaps the most boring theme I could think of for a game, but the theme does seem to fit the play. This borrow the mechanic from Emerald which I liked, which is everyone has multiple meeples, and when you move, you can choose any meeple, and move a number of spaces equal to the total number of meeples on space of the meeple you choose to move. Except that it's no race here. You're just zooming around a rhondel. And the rhondel is randomized every game for added spice. The number of meeples not only determines how far you move, but the total number of meeples on the spot you arrive at determines how many pieces of fruit you collect of the type on that space. To keep things from becoming too predictable on the rhondel, you can not move a meeple on your turn, and instead "deliver" some of your fruit to collect scoring tokens.

This game sort of reminds me of Taluva. A game that isn't super amazing, but is better than it has a right to be, for a game that is largely about simply looking at trying to get a decent move for yourself, without setting up the next guy for a big haul. There's enough here to make the game interesting, despite the fruity theme.

Reminds me of Wasabi in a strange way.  At it's core, it's a very simple game, but there's a lot of information to keep track of.  Kind of too much, for me at least.  I find this type of thinking to be a strain.

On a side note, I really like the one-use tokens, which let you break a rule.  Torres has a similar mechanic, and in theory I hate the added complexity, but in practice it feels great to get to indulge the "if only I could..." feelings that are so common in board games.

I didn't know where the Mallorcan Islands were until my wife sat down and I started explaining the game.  "I've been here!" Marta exclaimed as I mentioned where it takes place, and she read the names of the cities.  Finca means country farm in Spanish, and all the foods that you are dealing with are foods that are popular in Spain.

We had a good time playing, I like the component handling and gathering that goes on.

The reason I rank this game so high is twofold. First 
Mallorca is our vacation paradise of choice and every time I play I get this warm fuzzy feeling of reliving
our many vacations there. Next I`m a sucker for components. And I had never seen this many fruiteeples
in any game. They can be used in my on going creativity drive for carcassonne for example. Unique use of rondell
and various scoring make this a laid back experience I love revisiting.

RATING: 8
The premise of Finca is simple - acquire fruits through farming and then deliver those goods to the villages that need it, each of which have particular requests.

But the unique aspect comes from how the fruit is gained - a system using the central windmill.  You move a farmer based on where he started, and pick up fruit based on where he lands.  This creates a number of possibilities which shift with every player's turn.

The scoring is also pretty tight - it can easily be won or lost based on a single bonus tile.  So you must plan every move very carefully, and be certain the game doesn't end too soon.

The components here are beautiful and the rules are simple.  This is an ideal family game with a short playtime that works well for 2, 3 or 4 players.

Elegant and fairly quick, with a nice movement/harvesting system and pleasantly interwoven collection incentives. (Eg: you're ahead in figs, but to push the figs bonus tile towards scoring, you need grapes and olives.) Played 3p; could imagine 4p might be less satisfying due to more chaos, more fruit returning, more bonus tiles scoring, and more downtime.

RATING: 7
Components: Great chunky wooden bits. Clear iconography (except that the wild-fruit symbol looks like lemons).

Experience: The rondel is odd, but interesting. With two players, I mostly just interact with my own pawns, but also looking for scoring opportunities with my opponent.

The majorities are tense. By chance the fruit that is easy to get at a particular moment might also be in demand, and it might be in demand in a location looking to reward a majority in that very same fruit. But at other times, to win a tile I want is to score a majority bonus that my opponent will win.

Very capricious. Tense, but not sure I like it. The carts-as-currency feels a bit fiddly, and tacked on just to deter players from hoarding fruit, and/or from playing the waiting game if noone wants what is currently available in the regions.

RATING: 6
Move one of your pawns on the randomly created rondel to collect different types of fruit and/or a donkey token.  Pawns move the number of spaces equal to the number of pawns in the space they started from, and pick up the number of fruit equal to the number of pawns in the space where they end their move.  The pawn being moved counts for the total for both of those.  You deliver fruit to various regions based on face up order tiles if you have a donkey.  Flip a new tile in that region if any are left. When a number of regions are closed (varies by player number) the game ends and you score the value of the tiles you have delivered (number of fruit per tile) plus any bonus chips you managed to collect.  I like the random rondel setup and the way movement works there.  I don't think the order/delivery piece of the game is as interesting as the movement on the rondel.

Multilayer set collection games. To me, it looks like a clever rework of Dorn's Emerald: same movement rules, same multilayer set collection mechanism (though Finca adds an additional layer and more conflicting objectives).

Wonderful presentation and material, but the board could have been larger.

RATING: 6
Average filler-type game where you are moving some markers around a rondel to pick up different resources.  You get resources equal to the number of markers on that space of the rondel.  These resources are used in various quantities to buy VPs. Nothing great here.  The rondel provides the most strategy in terms of planning to land on spaces already populated.  But really the strategy is low because your choices are heavily dictated by what other players do.  Also the game tends to "lump up" where some resource types are obtained easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players grow and deliver fruit on the islands of Mallorca.   Standard produce and deliver game, where players either advance a pawn on a rondel (different each game) to gather fruit, or cash in a donkey chip to go deliver to where it's in demand.  Looks trivial at first glance, but there is a decent game lurking in there.  Looks wonderful, although a full size board and larger counters would have been nice, as you have to squint to see olives and almonds.  Seen it all before, but the presentation sets it off.

Runaway leader problem became evident early in the first play.  I really don't like the 5 pt bonus tiles, as they can only reward people that have already been successful in the game to that point.  Also, the "everyone loses all of a thing if someone tries to get one and can't" mechanic loses all strategic validity, primarily because there's literally no good reason NOT to take an item that will empty everyone else's supplies.  In short: the game is seriously overrated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a fairly simple game, that consists of manipulating a rondel to attempt to collect the different types of produce in order to complete deliveries. This is an enjoyable game but doesn't break any new ground (aside from the cool wooden fruit).  It worked quite well for a quiet 2 player game when neither of us were feeling confrontational, and it was interesting enough that we both wanted a second game immediately afterward to try to improve on our scores.  Further plays with more players have also been enjoyable, this would potentially make a good gateway game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Idea:
Gather resources and then buy cards with them.

Mechanism:
Move your units on the wheel. Movement is decided on how many units are on the square you leave from and amount of resources are decided on how many units are on the square you arrive. Try to get most resources that match card tokens on board to buy them for points. Some extra points if you score combinations.

to whom:
Easy to teach, technically no randomness. Okay game but 
I dont get why this was chosen as game of the year. Maybe still too 'light' for my taste and feels like too little replay value.

Light family game of collecting fruit and then delivering it (i.e. fulfilling orders, completing tickets, etc).   The chunky wood fruits are kinda cool.  However, the bonus tiles have very small fruit icons on them, which is kind of weird given how large the other components are.  The game is ultra simple, and nothing that you haven't seen before, but it's fast and pretty competitive.  The biggest problem I see is that it after a few plays, you'll have hit the ceiling with it.  Still, at this point, I'd like to play it a few more times.

Igazi jó kis családi játék, akár még kezdő játékosokkal is simán játszható, mivel egyszerű, könnyen érthető szabályai vannak és a játék menet is elég gyors. A lapátokon való lépkedés mechanizmusa jól fűszerezi a játékot, s lehet benne taktikázni is, mikor fejeződjön be a játék (ha a 6. ház is lekerül), megnézni ki kapja a Finca lapkát meg, ha az utolsó gyümölcslapkát is megszerezzük a kupacból, ha elfogyott a szamár lapka, akkor direkt szerezni egyet, hogy mindenkinek vissza kelljen adni egyet, stb. (2014.12.31.)
Érdemes ügyelni a Finca lapkákra, mert nálunk általában az nyer, aki a 6-os értékű gyümölcs lapkák közül megszerzi a sok gyümölcsös változatokat és ezek segítségével a Finca lapkákat is könnyebben gyűjti be. (2015.01.01.)

I can adjust my playing style to the group I'm playing with, and no matter which way they play it, I will enjoy it. For me it brings out the best in social gaming experience albeit no party game.
I see this as a likeable gateway game that will appeal to many. Reactions among strategic gamers has been poor, though.

RATING: 7.5
Nice mash of the Worker Placement and Pick-up & Deliver mechanics by using the rondel. Have to be able to have an overall strategy based on the initial layout of the board, yet adjust it on the fly as the resources change. Need to keep an eye on what your opponents are collecting -- making sure that what your doing doesn't benefit them too much.

A nice little game but I felt that where you are positioned in the game turn order makes a big difference. The player who won our game had one more turns than everyone else. It uses a rondel which your characters move around to collect fruit.

Really enjoyed my first two plays. My third and last play was months later, after playing a ton of other games in between. My later impression was that it was kind of a dull game. The phrase "not a lot of interesting choices to be made" comes to mind.

RATING: 7
Players move meeples around a rondel collecting fruit. There's a nice bit of strategy in blocking great moves from your opponent and taking advantage of the same moves when they become available. Players trade fruit gathered from this mechanic in sets, eventually comparing VPs collected from their trades. Plays quickly and looks beautiful, a nice easy euro.

45-60m, best with 3-4 players. 5+ plays.

This is a good gateway game with some decent strategy.  The highlight of the game is the rondel and how it works.  All players have their people on a randomly generated rondel.  When you move a person it moves equal to the number of people on that part of the rondel.  After you move, you gain resources of the rondel space you're currently occupying equal to the number of people that are on this rondel space.  The rondel has a line that divides the rondel in 2 halves and anytime you cross the line, you gain a disk which allows you to deliver fruit and gain scoring tiles.  There's more positive things that could be said, but there is one negative I would mention:  When considering the tile distribution you'll usually want to pick up 1's, 2's and 3's asap because they will allow you to get the 1-6 scoring tiles easier.  Sometimes this will be a matter of luck but overall I don't think it detracts from the game too much.

Beautifully produced game, but suffers a little from an unnecessarily cramped board.  Game easy to learn and teach, but lacks interesting strategy decisions; play is largely tactical in nature.  Overall reaction in my game group was that there are so many games that are more engaging, Finca will never hit the table.  Bland, generic Euro fare.

I'm going to use a word I haven't used in a long time to describe Finca.  Finca is [b]rad.[/b]  Seriously, I just love this game.  Finca can be a very tension-filled and contentious affair with two, and still be light-hearted and fun enough that my 6 year old can get in on the action with a group of four.

No, no, no, it's not an engine builder.  You are a fruit delivering tactician.  And it just works.   The board, the colors, the rondel, the wooden fruit bits.. the fincas...

And let's get real, Finca is also just super fun to say...

This is a great light euro. The components are top notch. The board is beautiful, the cardboard is good quality as are the wooden meeples and fruit pieces. The main game mechanic, moving around the rondel to collect fruit, is so simple but there's plenty of strategy and tactics. Granted, using this mechanic to gather fruit makes this game almost an abstract. But the chosen theme is so charming I don't mind. The amount of luck feels just right.

Finca is a game that's really less than the sum of its parts. The rondel is an interesting idea for taking resources, but it ends up being far too random to plan any strategy. Where you can go and how many fruits you collect entirely depend on what your opponents do, making it difficult to target a specific goal and achieve it. Also, the bonus Finca tile collected after a region is empty would make more sense if it were given to the person who has the most fruit resources of that particular type, not the most delivered. As written, I think the bonus tile leads to a runaway leader problem. 

Finca's pretty, and it's easy to learn. But it's too random and annoying to have much fun playing.

This was a surprise hit that frankly blew us out of the water. It was a last minute thought that I threw in with an order from Italy and it was one of the best decisions I'd made for 2015. I love the rondel mechanism here as well as in our first rondel game Seeland, and this feels different enough to Seeland to own both. Plays quickly with 2 players in about 30 mins, the components are gorgeous and of great quality, and can be as relaxing or as cutthroat as you want it to be. We always play with the designer suggested rules of "fruit shortage" tailored to number of players. It's always a luxury to play on Yucata.de without this restriction! Simple and elegant rules with rich and rewarding gameplay.

Spiel des Jahres Nominee 2009 & other awards.  Best with 2, good with 3, otherwise becomes too chaotic/random; quite a bit of luck, farming theme like Agricola but much lighter; racing/pickup-and-deliver theme (imagine Cartagena but on a rondel, and with deliveries). Elegant & easy to learn, lovely components, potential as a gateway game. 

Don't miss [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/410403/finca-tile]this rule[/url] about the ? Finca tile, which is unclear in the rulebook.  

When playing with 2 or 3, consider the variant that reduces the amount of fruit ([url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/420337/less-fruits-with-less-players]here[/url] and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/405674/2-variants-for-the-2-player-game]here[/url]) to ensure continued fruit supply tension in games with less players. We remove 3 fruit of each type in 3 player games, and 6 fruit of each type in 2 player games.

The system is great for producing tension: you're not sure how much your pieces will be able to move until it's your turn and you're racing the other players to collect fruit and fulfill orders with set collection bonuses thrown in. I got caught short having collected too many fruits and spent too little, and therein lies the challenge of the game. Pretty simple, but it engaged me fully while playing.

Finca is certainly a clever and accessible game with some substance.  What bothers me about it though is that it seems often to be a chaotic ride where 1) the scoring depends on which random delivery tiles get turned up, and this may or may not jive with the fruit you have or are able to collect; and 2) there seems to be a run-away leader problem as the leader collects more and more of the bonus tiles.  It appears important to stay away from the "wild" scoring tiles at the beginning as you need these to be able to compete for these bonus tiles.

Fun game.  Simple to teach and play, yet interesting strategies develop several times during play.  How the player dynamics change as any single resource is about to run out make for fun play too.

Components are first rate.  I think it would have been better to actually dull-out the colors on the board itself, making it easier to see what's really going on.  A duller board, like Primordial Soup, really makes the colorful wooden pieces stand out.

Based on one play at Unity Games (2010), I enjoyed this game. I'd call it a combination of set collecting worker placement, although neither description is dead on accurate. It's the kind of game I don't love, and don't tend to "want" to play, but when I do, I enjoy them. This one had a little bit of a brain burn aspect to it, and a nice combination of planning and randomness. I'd play it again for sure.

A solid light-weight Euro with some nice looking bits and an interesting windmill mechanic.  It pushes some of the same buttons for me as Thurn and Taxis, and I think that's the crowd it's going for.  Overall, I'm glad I get to play this every once in a while.

Lots of replayability, beautiful design, great interaction due to the rondel. For delivery games, this and Santiago de Cuba are unsurpassed (unless you are a train nut)! Fab as a 2-player or a 4.

Lots of decision making, a small amount of luck, opportunities to block opponents, or even help them out, beautiful components, friendly, non intrusive theme. LOVE LOVE LOVE

Jópofa családi játék, ami tökéletes gateway játéknak. Van gondolkodnivaló benne, de azért nem egy brainburner, inkább könnyed szórakozás. Általában elegendő az éppen aktuális 4-5 lehetőségedet végignézni, és kiválasztani a legjobbat. Persze azért lehet benne előre is gondolkodni pár lépésnyit. Bizonyára szépek az alkatrészek is (képek alapján), de én csak online játszottam.

Jópár kétszemélyes online játék után arra jutottam, hogy ez kettesben egész gondolkodós, kicsi szerencsefaktorú játék. Persze ahogy többen játszunk, úgy válik egyre "családibbá".

RATING: 7
Rating based on 2P. The mancala mechanism becomes so chaotic with more players that you are more adrift on the tide than controlling your own fate. Regardless of number of players, this doesn't go above '7' for me because of the randomness of the stacked tiles -- in almost every game there is a moment in which it is obvious that a tile reveal went strongly in favor of one player over another.

====

Finca is a beautiful game not only in its presentation but also in its mechanics. The game is quite straight-forward in its play -- collect fruits and ship them for points. However, the action is driven by a rondel where the jockeying for position makes the game a joy to play. Careless and thoughtless rondel play is a sure path to defeat in Finca and new players never appreciate its subtlety -- but long time players know.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Pretty light, but very pretty and easy to explain.  A good family game and a pleasant way to waste 30-45 minutes.

I was really hoping I was going to enjoy this one more.  It had all the properties of a lighter game that I would enjoy and I was intrigued by the rondel and the set collection. Just seemed like a very pleasant game.  While playing it, I actually did [i]enjoy[/i] it, and doing various light calculations to figure out when was the best time to trade in sets for points was interesting enough.  But once the game was over, I didn't really feel any warm feelings for the game.  It sort of left a dry, mechanical taste in my mouth, with a little too much randomness in the tile distribution and a little too much repetition in the way turns are played.  Plus, after my 2-player game of it, I don't think I would ever want to play this with more players. A big part of the game is knowing when to go for the bonus points for clearing an area.  And the only real way to tell is to look at everyone's collections and count up everyone's individual fruit types (depending on the bonus tile requirements). It's that sort of pain-in-the-ass counting that I hate in filler games.  Maybe if a better set collection game was built around the rondel I would have liked this game more.  Indeed, the rondel is the most enjoyable part and I appreciated the timing aspect that came to collecting tiles.  It just didn't pan out for me by the end.

Well worth the purchase this one was. It comes with some beautiful components. I must say that I was amazed at all you get for the price of the game. This game was ALOT of fun, easy to learn/teach and quick to play. The windmill has a nice mechanic to it, as to how you move your farmers.

This is a great game for family & friends and would make a good intro to board gaming. I don't know how the heavy hardcore gamers out there would feel about this game, but it might be a nice break to play and have fun for them as well.
I myself had a blast with this game and am thankful that I came across it here on BGG. You can't go wrong for the price and it has alot of cool features going on. There's more to it then meets the eye, if you think about it strategically.

I would be willing to give Finca one more shot, but only with two players. With four, it was an utterly random and unengaging game. The chunky fruits are nice. One of my buddies is a fan of the game, but personally I see it as something better left for families with kids in the age 7 to 12 range.

Finca is a nice balance of pleasantness and strategy. It's an engaging experience if approached lightly. If I'm in a competitive mood, this won't cut it. But for playing with the kids, or a casual game with my wife, or a simple time-filler with my game group, it fits the bill very well.

Wife approved. We both really liked the game. You do have to plan your moves. Very good/fun family pickup and deliver game with a neat pickup mechanic. Many opportunities to score points with deliveries, bonus tiles for getting "sets" of delivery tiles and from the Finca tiles. I also like the anti-hoarding mechanism that can come back to bite a person who stockpiles too much. Good observation of what orders other players can fill is important to a winning strategy. Overall a quick, light enjoyable game with a fair amount of depth.

Such a simple game that plays beautifully. Not too strategic, just lots of fun. Production is top notch and similar to Stone Age. The game works wonderfully for two and plays really quickly. Infact setting up the game takes nearly as long as playing it, but that's good fun too with such lovely playing pieces. My partner loves this one too, so all in all well chuffed.

Although I've only played this once face to face, I have played a few more times on yucata.de

It has some nice mechanisms, such as the rondel used for fruit harvesting, and the bonus finca tokens that go to the player who has delivered the most of that fruit at the time... but overall I just find the game quite dull... it's also quite difficult to get the fruit you want from working the rondel, although the special ability tokens can help with that.

An average Euro game, with nothing to really sell it to me.

Nice, light game of set collection with a simple but suprisingly good working mechanism which prevents players from hoarding too many goods: if a player needs to take a good but none is left in the supply then *all* players must return their goods.  This makes greedy play quite risky and adds a lot of fun to the game.  Recommended!

 I picked it up because of the SdJ.  With that in mind, it appears to be what it is.  A light family game that can easily be taught and played under an hour.  I played with two of my children and we had fun with it.  There seemed be some choices to make and some race to get things from time to time.  I enjoyed the experience over all with my kids and would like to play it with them some more.  I may pull it out with gamers when I need a 30-45 game (of course with us that means 90 mins ;))  I think they will enjoy it, but I don't think it would be something that would get into a rotation.

Played it again after many years and I think it's still a nice game, even though a light one.

I wouldn't play it again with 4 players, maybe with 3, but to me this is a 2 player game. The more players you add, the more chaos and less tactical/strategical it gets.

Otherwise a nice family game.

This is a nice, simple little game that unfortunately takes just a tad too long to play (variants to try in the future: only 3 tiles per community / fewer communities). The components are excellent - especially the wooden fruit pieces - but the box is ridiculously big; the board should have been a quad-fold and the box half size. Another issue is that although the rules are straightforward, the rondel mechanism incurs a substantial risk of AP. Gameplay also suffers from the typical issues with rondel games, i.e. markedly different game experience depending on the number of players. I leave out the community bonus tiles when playing this game with kids. Despite me not being over-enthusiastic about it, it has been *very* well received by family and fellow gamers.

Finca sits up near the pinnacle of my favorite games. It’s a feel-good game for me, a game that never leaves me without a smile on my face. Collecting fruits can do that to a man.

Finca is mean, downright spiteful, and it’s excruciatingly timed. [thing=102680]Trajan[/thing]’s rondel has nothing on this game: If you need to get somewhere, you’re going to have to depend on everyone else to help you get there. And everyone can see perfectly well what shipments are called for on the board, as well as what fruit you and everyone else have ready to ship. Finca isn’t about secret objectives or concealed cards or die rolls: It’s about a race you all run relative to each other, for the same goal, in clear view of each other.

Pick up and deliver type game. Components are very pretty and game is easy to teach.

You move your meeples around a pinwheel to pick up fruit. The amount of meeples on the space you pick up from is exactly how many spaces you must move forward and the amount of meeples on the space you stop on is how much of that fruit you get. Love the puzzle aspect.

A simple set-collecting game with a fruity theme. You opportunistically traverse a rondel to collect fruit and donkeys, then deliver when demand tiles match what you've collected. This is the type of Euro that I'm fast losing patience with, it's light, fun, but totally routine.

RATING: 8
I'm really happy I got to play this--the hype was pretty exciting and I like this sort of game quite a bit. My impressions:

A++ components.  Absolutely beautiful board and I LOVE the wooden fruit.  I don't think great components always make a game more fun to play, but this time they did.

As for the gameplay, it's just as everyone is saying--it's a really simple to learn, but you have real decisions with real ramifications--and multiple ones, so there are several factors you have to take into consideration.  You'll do much better if you decide at the beginning which tiles you want to go for and keep the bonuses in mind. I didn't do this very well on my first play, but I'd love to try again. Windmill is nifty.  

I'm a fan.  My vote for SdJ. I'd almost certainly buy this if only you could play it with five. EDIT: Owned! Ehehehe.  (4 plays)

Really smart little Euro-style game.   The game has a good amount of "thinky" parts that work well.

While it's a good game for gamers, the easy-to-explain rules and attractive components probably make it an even better fit for a family game session.

My sense is that this is a game that I will rate higher than the norm, because it really checks a lot of boxes that I look for: easy to explain, thinky, plays quick, cosmetically attractive and a family-friendly theme.

Pretty much all-around "meh". It did nothing wrong, but didn't really do anything right.

Each game played almost exactly the same. The same decisions came again and again. Yea there is some skill in making the right choices, but they just aren't that riveting.

Heck, for being a game about fruit we couldn't even tell what they were supposed to be.

However, it did play fast and was a very clean design. You might like it for fluffy family filler.

A simple set collection game with a innovative idea of commodity speculation. The game is interesting, but the game repeats the same action again and again. It weakens the game replayability. For me, Finca did not attract me at all. Finca gave me the impression of a mediocre set collection game. The game is ok but did not grasp me at all. I would rather play better set collection games instead of Finca. Thus, I had sold the game away.

Has a kinda mancala-like wheel that drives your set collection.  Collecting and selling fruit, and delivering better sets than your opponents.

RATING: 6
Kind of a souless implementation of a "rondel" game.  Because of the verflicht like movement, it does not reward strategic planning in the same way the rondel games usually do.  Instead this one is much more tactical.  Additionally, for a SdJ game, this can be played very brutally.  

On the whole, it seemed a bit tired to me.  The situational luck factor seemed high, particularly for a game with potential for interplayer agression to begin with.  You could find yourself out of this game with little fault of your own.

Particularly disturbing is the possibility that several 1 tiles could come up early and be nabbed by one person.  Important bonuses rely upon these tiles and a player might find themselves out of the running.  I wanted to like it, but give it a meh.

RATING: 5
Disclaimer: only played with 4 players. However, I simply don't care for this configuration. Very difficult to plan anything beyond one turn. In addition, for a pick-up-and-deliver game, I don't like the fact that one could potentially pick up a lot of different fruits at once. If a number of the "1" tiles come up, a single person can buy them all, significantly hampering the chances of anybody else getting one of the bonus tiles.

A decent filler but too long for a filler though you can easily make the game longer or shorter.  Actually the game does manage to keep you interested as you need to keep an eye on several things, it is mostly family fare and good for what it is, a basic set collection game.  Not sure I like the Donkey rule at all, maybe giving the fruit back but with more than 2 players the donkey rule seems too harsh.  Item numbers should have been scaled to number of players too, like less fruit available in 2 player. Worked fine with two, 3 should be okay, 4 would be a little rough, especially with rules as written.

Rating after four two-player games with my wife.  Finca seems to be an ideal style of game for non-hardcore gamers.  The rules are simple, but there is strategy and tactics in the "rondel" mechanism and also in the approach you take with gathering fruits.  I was surprised by how quickly the game went - there are only 4 Fincas to be placed in the two-player game.  So you have to keep on top of which piles are shrinking and where you stand.  There is even a touch of screwage in that there is only four donkeys and care must be taken when you lower the pile to 0 - if your opponent is close to the divider line you are toast.

The bits are beautiful.  I think this will become a favorite for my wife and I.

I was surprised to enjoy this game a bit as I thought it would be too light for me.  I didn't find the VP conversions particularly interesting but the production mechanic presented some pleasant problems to solve.  It reminded me of the mancala mechanic in Trajan but in a quicker package.  There are merits to that.

There is more depth and strategy to this game the more I play it!!!
Just a fun game.  Easy to learn and some fun mechanisms.  We can play this with all levels of gamers in our family, and it appeals to every one of them.  Love the great board and bits!  I am still pouting that I got rid of my beautiful box insert to organize.

RATING: 7
In Finca, players move pawns around a circular rondel in order to collect fruit that can then be traded in for matching scoring tiles. Each region of the board has 4 tiles and once a region is cleared of tiles there is a majority comparison for who has collected the most fruits-on-tiles of fruit the region is associated with. Once 4 regions are empty of tiles points are added up.

It's a very simple game about moving your pawns around the rondel in the most efficient and advantageous way possible. A Pawn moves as many spaces as the pawns on the originating tile and collect as many fruits as pawns on the finishing tile. The game is really about figuring out what pawns to move to get what is in demand and set up big future turns. There are lots of randomizing elements to make one game different from the next, but you are still doing the same thing every game, even if the specific priorities differ. It's a solid game at two players and becomes a bit less controlled at higher player counts.

RATING: 5
A very weak effort. Honestly the only reason I wasn't irritated while we were playing is that I like fruit a lot. I wish I'd had some to eat. This is one of those games that you could just as easily learn with solid colors and shapes in place of a theme. There are points for collecting sets, bonus points for collecting the most of a certain fruit, some influence over when bonus tiles are given out, extra points for collecting one set of every size, and some tactics to how many fruit you can collect at any given time and when / how often you can turn in your sets. It's just.... insubstantial. Honestly I'd be more willing to play again with no theme at all to distract me.

After a few plays it's exactly what I was expecting, which is a good light game that we can play as we choose.  Easy breezy or a bit more cutthroat if we like, but never super aggressive.  It's as airy as the windmill.

Having a bit more fun with Finca each time we play it.

It's easy for me to see why this was nominated for the SDJ. It's pleasantly simple, and the rondelle is interesting enough to keep things entertaining. It offers the chance to  play a little bit of 'screw your neighbour' without being so cutthroat as to engender feelings of anger or betrayal. The sense of one-upmanship when your opponent(s) allows you to harvest a bunch of fruit is gratifying, as is nabbing that finca out from someone else.

While I can't imagine Finca being the kind of game that memories are built on, it certainly does a number of things well enough to provide an evening's entertainment.

Downgraded to 6/10. Not worse than some other games I rate higher but this one suffered from playing it too often. 
---
Again lighter fare from HIG. Finca plays in the vein of Thurn & Taxis or Oregon. No single element is new but it is a nice combination of the Mac Gerdts rondel mechanism with movement from Emerald, majority set collection from multiple games and the agricultural theme from Agricola. In the end a single majority decided our game. Is this because we all didn't apply superior strategy or is it because there just isn't that much strategy on top of the obvious? For the time being, I prefer the two other mentioned games as they fill the same niche but will be happy to play this again.

This should really be a fun game with all of the wooden fruit playing pieces.

I never really understood the "pandering to the SdJ committee" comments until I sat down and read the rules.  I can now appreciate that response, though that doesn't take away from the fact that it really does what it sets out to quite well.

The theme, though not really anything new, is kind of different, and the wooden fruit meeples go a long way in improving the atmosphere of what is essentially a very dry game.  The rules are very concise and easy to teach and learn.

The decisions are usually pretty interesting - rondel positioning, which piles to try and deplete both to maximize points as well as shore up bonuses.  All this and a quick playtime, seems like a winner to me.

This game is ultimately a TtR variant with fruit-colors instead of train-colors. Every turn you can choose between taking colors or completing a railway line. The minor difference is the rondel which provides players to ability to choose what color they want (to a certain extent) + an Emerald-style movement system.

Right now, it is fun perhaps because it is fresh.  But will I want to play the game after 20 games?

+ Simple rules

- Nothing really new here
- Could be prone to AP which would destroy the game

A positive surprise even with knowledge of its SdJ-nomination, which actually is in itself quite a surprise. The game is definitely built around an uninspiring theme and the actual play only really happens in the windmill. But, I really like this windmill and the decisions it forces you to do. I am also quite fond of the regulating mechanism for fruits and carts although it works against the theme. Also of note are the nice bits and good looks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The rondel mechanism is such that with more than 2, it is impossible to plan anything, which means no strategy, and longer turns, as you can't plan before it comes to you. The push your luck aspect of resource management (where you can lose everything if the bank runs out) could be interesting, but paired with the carts being necessary to make a delivery (carts which, themselves, can be lost), it means that sometimes you don't have what it takes to make a worthwhile delivery and end up losing everything.

I suppose this would be interesting with two. With more than that, it is pure chaos. Even with two, I doubt it would be more interesting than other Euros of similar length, like Havana, Splendor, or Santiago de Cuba.

I have only played this game in 4-players mode.

In 4-players mode (and probably 3-players mode), luck dominates the chance to win. You can only prevent being the last, but you cannot control the winning paths as other players interfere the "resource circle" too much. I think 2-players mode is much better, but I haven't try that.

Very good/fun family pickup and deliver game with a neat pickup mechanic similar to Emerald. Many opportunities to score points with deliveries, bonus tiles for getting "sets" of delivery tiles and from the Finca tiles. I also like the anti-hoarding mechanism that can come back to bite a person who stockpiles too much. Good observation of what orders other players can fill is important to a winning strategy. Overall a quick, light enjoyable game with a fair amount of depth.

Felt like slightly heavier filler material that comes packaged as a full out board game.  Mixes a bit of rondel action with however many guys are on your space = how many of that resource you receive.  Instead of moving your guy on the rondel and gaining resources, you can choose to use an acquired cart to deliver up to 6 goods to complete available orders.  Different majorities exist that are scored when provinces are cleared.  Quick playing, easy instructions, easily learned, a little bit of thought.

The components are great---the wooden fruit tokens in particular are bright and colorful (very glad that they didn't just go with wooden cubes).  The gameplay is fairly straightforward with a few simple rules, but we quickly started seeing that there was more strategy and depth than meets the eye---it's one of those games that you can kind of tune out and play pleasantly or you can dig deep and really get into it.  The windmill/rondel mechanism used to harvest the fruit is simple, but we started getting much more aggressive and cutthroat in planning our moves and denying each other's plans.  Our delivery plans became a lot more strategic as well and we now always keep an eye on likely deliveries by the other player to either snipe or sabotage them.

The only thing I'm a little disappointed with is that the beautiful map really doesn't serve any gameplay function---it would have been interesting to have a geographic factor in the game as well.

Note, we only use 10 of each fruit when playing with two players. We found that this really increased the tension in fruit collection and forced you to pay attention to your opponent a lot more to prevent losing all of your fruit. Similar to [thing=6249][/thing], I suspect that the game is most strategic with two players, since you have better control over the gameplay, but we're excited to try it with more.

This is a wonderful game for 2-4 in 45 minutes. It combines a "rondel light" with the movement of Downfall of Pompeii and payouts of Cartagena.

Played twice in it's first outing, it offers a bit more strategy than you'd expect. 

It's a fun romp that should last for quite a while; though we'll see which is why it's got a provisional 7.

Update: While there are a few elements of chaos here, there's certainly enough strategy for the long term. 6 Plays and counting :) Upped rating to an 8.

A very colorful game where you try to get as much produce as possible and the means to get it to the various markets. Sometimes its worth it to harvest fewer fruits just so you can make some deliveries and grab some points. Go for those bonuses too.

We mostly play this as a two player game. There's a bit more direct screwage in this (taking a numbered tile that you know your opponent needs) than most 2p Euros, but it's a great game. Hans Im Gluck always seem to put out great quality games, and this is not different, with six differently shaped wooden fruit pieces, and thick card with great artwork.

RATING: 7
Nice gameplay, the movement wheel to determine how far to go depending on tokens on the initial cell is a bit confusing, but the amount of goods received being the amount of tokens on the landing tile make more sense. Enjoyable and plsys very well with 2.

RATING: 8.6
What a great mancala type game.  Tactical and responsive, with a certain amount of chaos and luck.  Clear and simple rules that let you focus on the game itself, my favorite kind.  Easy to teach.  Highly interactive, with a certain amount of screwage -- almost every action you take will affect the other players.  The components are excellent with good iconography.  Aesthetically the game seems to follow what I call the "vacation in hell with pretty flowers" approach.  Just like Vanuatu, these are games where there is a significant amount of screwage disguised as a vacation to the tropics, without a worry in sight.  For players that like to compute all possible permutations and think multiple steps ahead, the game can lead to AP.  If you play it to simply enjoy the ride, it is a great ride.  After playing with 4 players, I must note that the 2 player and 4 player games are very different in feel.  The 4 player adds more chaos and at the same time I was surprised to see how much the players were quiet and thinking during their turn.  Definitely feels like a heavier and more serious game than the colorful look would lead you to believe.  I have introduced this game to all types of players, gamers and non-gamers, and it's always well received, one of my favorite "gateway" games.

Very simple collect and exchange game, that looks great and plays very fast. Won several prices, and I can understand why. Light family game that is ideal to introduce non gamers to gaming. 

This game is always a close race that is decided, near the end of the game, on details and (some) luck. But optimizing your turns is absolutely essential, as is picking the right fruit order tiles at the right moment.

12-10-11-3p game just as fun!

11-27-11-I was on the fence forever on whether to buy this, worried that it would be too childlike, (how I feel about The Amazing Labyrinth) but played it for the first time tonight (2p) and was very pleased!  Very simple to learn, probably took about 20 min to play.  This is a huge plus w/my impatient guys.  Despite the simplicity of the rules and gameplay, there are some tough decisions to make over which fruit to collect and how to keep your opponent(s) in check.  I think it actually reminds me a bit of Thurn & Taxis but it won't be as quiet as that one.  I predict this is going to be a favorite. Rating after 1 play =9.

From the size of the box, this looked like it was going to be more involved -- it's actually a simple game with a nice amount of depth.

The wheel of fruit can make for some pretty dead turns, but usually it's an engaging mechanism, and the way the fruit stacks work keeps things interesting.

Finca was enjoyable all the way through, and I'd love to play it again. It's light, fast-paced, and easy to get right away, and it uses luck rather well in different ways.

RATING: 7
A surprinsingly simple, yet effective little game.  While it look like a simple ressource collecting game at first glance, but there is a lot planning to do if you want to perform well. 
I teached the game to non gamers and they all enjoyed it, wich is a very good aspect.  Everyone loves to collect the little wooden fruits!
To me, this game seem a little underrated.  You really should try it for yourself and try it with less experienced players, as it seems like a very good intro to boardgaming.  I take it out for a quick play when I have friends or family over that are not boardgamers.

Finca is light, quick and fun!

Surprisingly interested little euro game.  Definitely interactive in that you can steal deliveries and mess with each others' moves on the windmill/rondel.  After a few plays I would put this at a 7 for me.  I prefer longer games, more theme too.  But, for the cost and the play time the game is worth the price of admission.  Lots of interesting fruit bits too.

RATING: 7
Solid game. This one gets some help due to it having some of the nicest wooden components I have seen in any euro thus far (fruit pieces). It's nicely balanced and streamlined, but it also requires a decent amount of planning ahead. Finca is a good game (clocking in at less than 1 hour and easy to explain) to introduce to non-gamers.

Update: After playing this game almost a year later, I have to slightly lower my rating. It's still a "fun" game, more cute than compelling. Though, it's probably not my kind of game. That is, it doesn't scratch any particular gaming itch for me. It's not heavy, not ultra-light, not a filler, not particularly tense, and not compact. It's just a cutesy board game with cool bits and a pleasant theme. There's not much going on here. Still, it's a good game for families, or perhaps the girlfriend. 

Update 7/12/15: 

I haven't played this one in about a year. It's even quicker than I remember (about 40 minutes for a 2 player game). You can certainly break the "framework" by just hoarding fruit pieces. It tries to prevent this with a rule that if there are not enough of a certain fruit, all fruit pieces of that type must be returned to the supply. I might try scaling the number of fruit pieces next time, maybe taking out 8-10 for a 2 player game. In a larger game, this shouldn't be a problem, even with 3 players, I assume.

3 / 5 - Good.

I quite enjoyed this game - it strikes a nice balance between shoving in quite a lot of decision making but still being pleasantly approachable. The theme is very silly and just painted on, but does allow for some quality "ass" jokes. Variable setup should see a reasonable amount of re playability at least. Would make a good family game.

Wonderfully easy to teach with enough decisions to make it interesting to play. The game is surprisingly tense with two players. Lots of ways to make points and while you can mess with your opponents a bit, it isn't really devastating. The board is beautiful, colorful, and the components top quality. Such a nice change of pace from many other Euro's "beige, beige, beige!" color scheme. I like the windmill rondel. While it is a bit abstract, it adds a nice strategy to the game (especially with two player). Great game!

Fantastic two-player game, among the best of those I have played.  This is actually a fairly deep game even though it plays light and fast.  The timing and order of moves is incredibly important.  You want to chain moves to block your opponent and set yourself up to claim bonuses in the completed regions.  Timely usage of the one-time perks can really throw off your opponent.  That being said, the nice thing is that you don't have to pay attention to any of that and you can still have fun and feel like you are accomplishing something.  That is why in our household it is non-gamer wife and gamer husband approved.

Have now played a third game with three players and it is almost as good as with two players.

**********

Okay, this game plays amazingly with three players.  I can't think of anything not to like.  I could play every day and not grow tired of it.

Re-playability is through the roof with the random setup of goods tiles, bonus tiles, and wheel sections.  I love that you need to have an initial strategy but must be flexible if someone crosses your path by taking one of "your" tiles.

In my mind, I picture a giant tree diagram with various paths, of which many lead to victory.  Some are more optimal than others, but many can work.  Sure, you have the most optimal path in mind, but you need to be cognizant of others.  Perhaps those paths are not quite as efficient but will be easier to navigate depending on your positions on the wheel and your opponents' fruit holdings/positions/plans.

**********

Make sure you play with the variant that removes 3 of each fruit with 3 players and 6 of each with 2 players!  The potential scarcity creates more decision points throughout the game.

09/25/12 Played a four-player game. I found Finca to be a mediocre intro level game. Its not bad, merely "eh". I could be talked in to playing it again. But I won't be clamoring for it. The owner swore it plays much better with two as you can do more planning (less chaos). Alas that is irrelevant to me, as I doubt I'll ever be in a two-player game of it.  The owner thought the artwork was fantastic. I had the opposite view. There was so much green on the board it was hard to see the fruits. And if you're color blind, forget about it! I also feel the bonus tiles are there only to help the rich get richer. I saw a *huge* number of comments on the game here on BGG with the words chaotic, random, frustrating, and analysis paralysis in them. I agree.

Um, it's nice at least, I mean hey, wooden fruits and stuff. 
Then it stops being interesting, especially if you play with inexperienced players. Hard enough to form any long term strategies because of the hidden tiles, but when you can't anticipate your opponents' plans because there aren't any, it boils down to grab what you can and hope for the best. I can live with it, but it falls between two chairs, as with hardcore gamers it's too casual, with casual gamers it's too random. It could be an excellent game if you find the right opponents, I like it even, but certainly not my first choice in any category.

Game in a Nutshell: Send your workers around a circle (roundel) collecting fruit then trade the fruit in for points.

Played as: 2 player on Yucata.de

Pros: With a roundel, there's a lot of tough decisions and tactics packed into a simple mechanic. Finca doesn't take long to explain and start playing. I can't imagine boiling down this particular type of game any more then they've done here. So as an entry point, I think this could find a broad audience. 

Cons: I wouldn't want to play this with someone prone to analysis paralysis. In some ways, the game is almost too simple, in that it's a one trick pony that offers almost no variety as the game progresses. In other words, I found it to get sort of stale before finishing one play.

Other: This was my first roundel game. I think it's an interesting mechanic that I'd like to explore in other games where there's more built around it.

Best Use: I would peg this as a bridging game between kids and adults.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After 106 plays. Rating is for 2 players only; it's waaaaay better with 2 than with 3 or 4. 

For me, a classic - one of my favorite games of all time. 

Simple rules, great components, not fiddly, not burdened with a billion bits. 

With 2 players, it's an abstracty look-ahead game with mostly open information and unexpectedly strong geometrical considerations. Consequently it doesn't feel like a Euro, which is why I like it (this is also one of the complaints among people who don't like it - they wanted a Euro and they got something else). 

There are a surprising number of factors to consider in deciding what to do on each turn, and they interact in subtle ways which never fail to delight, and which always keep me on my toes. 

Figuring out when and how to use the 4 special actions is especially interesting; there are hidden uses for them that make the decision even more difficult with experience. 

With more than 2 players, it's hard to plan and then it's not as great. With 3, it's still pretty good. With 4: meh. 

Components are beautiful but theme is meaningless. Many commenters seem to think there's not much to it, but I suspect that this stems from a) not having tried it with 2; and b) the BGG tendency to mistake simple rules for simple play. It isn't simple. Ask yourself: if I were a professional Finca player, whose income depended on winning, how would I approach the game?

weaknesses:

1. fairly long setup time.

2. Depending on the initial tile layout, there seems to be a first mover advantage (specifically when the the player who can make the first purchase can purchase low tiles, for example a 1-2-3 tile combo). If this really is a problem it should be fairly easy to correct.

I always love a well made game with nice wooden components. All the goods that you produce are coloured and shaped, and the art is always pretty to look at.

This is a fairly light but very enjoyable game. The rondel production mechanic is interesting, but using it to plan ahead gets more difficult with more players. However, the choices presented to you are interesting, and you are able to plan based on what bonuses are available and where, and on what goods can currently be delivered.

Finca is a tremendous lighter Euro.  The components are spectacular; everyone adores the multitude of wooden "fruiples".

The gameplay is simple, and is quick to explain.  However, the gameplay is surprisingly deep.  Players assume it's about collecting the most fruit and buying tiles, but it quickly becomes clear that less fruit in the right places can score much higher.  I rate it high because the mechanical simplicity to depth ratio is superb, combined with a fairly short play time.  It also scales well with all player numbers, though I do recommend a limiting fruit variant to add strategy.

After approx. 10 plays, my wife and I (part time Eurogamers in our mid 30s with young kids) still enjoy playing this game.

It is a "family weight" Euro, but it has enough tactical decisions to stay interesting for several plays.  We prefer to play the game 2 or 3 player - but playing with 4 is still fun.

The presentation of the game is also fantastic - the wooden fruit shapes have a nice tactile feel, and definitely add to the play experience.

Bottom Line - this is a great game!!

Basically players each have three farmers on a wheel depicting various goods.  On your turn you can move a farmer around the wheel the number of spaces equal to the spot you start on.  You collect the good you land on in the amount equal to the number of farmers on the space.  If there isn't enough of a particular good to fill what you're owed then everybody, including you, first return all of that good back to the supply before you collect.  

On your turn you can also, rather than move, fulfill orders on the board.  You get points per order and for various other set-collection majorities related to the orders.  You also have the ability to break some of the movement or order fullfillment rules with special one-time use tiles you begin the game with (they're worth points at the end of the game if you don't use them).  I like the game, it's somewhat clever but is probably is too prone to AP for my taste.

interesting mechanics combined with what appears to be a very dry stapled on theme.   do like the rondel mechanic in a very fast playing game.  i really did enjoy my first couple of plays.  agree with the comments that the 4 player game is not a good game, but i enjoyed my 2 player games.

i'll start it out with a rating just shy of 8, but i expect it might drift a bit lower.

*****************

underrated gateway game.  fruit meeples are very well done and the game introduces some advance copies (see also: Vegas Showdown for another example).  i think these function better than Ticket to Ride / Settlers because they do a better job at introducing more concepts for future games.

RATING: 7.5
Rating could go up. At first I thought, [gameid=36616], what with the "rondel" and the need for brain-melting look-ahead. "Brain-melting" isn't necessarily a bad thing, but a game needs more than just look-ahead. After a couple plays though, I'm seeing more similarities to [gameid=26235]. I like Pick and Pack [b]a lot[/b]. Maybe not as much as milomilo likes Finca, but the action tiles do a great job of mellowing out the brain-melty. Controlling the timing of the endgame is crucial in both games, which makes the deployment of the action tiles tense. Also, both games have fruit, and I like fruit.

Didn't like this as a 4 player game.  If your meeples are not along with the wave, you're going to get murdered.  Further, too much time between turns screws up any planning you do other than mass collect resources.  In all it felt out of control and random much of the time.

This is the kind of game my wife loves and it's great with two.  The rondel resource collection is very cool as is the delivery system.  It plays out very quickly and smoothly.  The only thing that is slightly unwieldy is the planning/counting for majority bonuses.  Still, it rates highly due to its simplicity and fast play.

RATING: 9
Really good family-weight game that can become cutthroat at times when fruits run out - it has a bit of a race aspect and moving your farmers around the windmill is a clever game design. To sum up: a good and solid medium-light game that plays fast as hell but the decisions are interesting enough to keep avid boardgamers happy. Too bad it's out of print now as I think it would still appeal a lot of people.

Gyönyörű kivitelezés, sok színes fa gyümölcs, változatos játék és magas újrajátszhatóság a mindig más kezdő felállásnak köszönhetően. A gyümölcs illetve finca lapkák véletlenszerűsége visz változatosságot a játékba és teszi "családivá" (értsd: bárki nyerhet). Persze kell azért jó logikázás is a győzelemhez (rondellán való lépkedésnél elsősorban). Az időzítés kulcsfontosságú, ami a megfelelő pillanatban történő szállítást és a segéd lapkák legoptimálisabb felhasználását jelenti. Ez hoz minimális feszültséget is a játékba, ami jó!
Szomorú, hogy maximum 4-en játszható.

RATING: N/A

Finca gets pegged as being a "standard Euro" because "all you're doing" is collecting stuff to meet set collection goals to earn points [a la one million other light-weight Euro designs with contract cards and set collection and so on].

But, that misses the fact that the heart of the game is the lovely and difficult rondel mechanism. Played as a "standard Euro" with no thought put into the rondel movement, the game is pretty much, as claimed, arbitrary and useless.

Played with a modicum of concern for the movement on the rondel and the timing of cashing in collected sets [as well as choice of which cards to claim, instead of just picking one and working diligently to collect it], the game is quite nice.

Best with 2, probably, and the amount of fruit in the game needs adjusted down [I'd play with 9 for 2 players, 12 for 3 players] like the much house-ruled size of the tile-set in Taluva, but it is a very cute and clever game with lots of Euro goodness.

Tentative score only. Finca's scoring and mechanics feel a lot like Thurn & Taxis but without the interminable frustration of waiting for the deck to serve up the right card to complete a route. 

Finca is also the best game for generating double entendres about donkeys! 

I think Finca would make a great gateway game.

RATING: 8
This is another great light/mid euro. It essentially relies on set collection (fruits) which can be traded in to acquire scoring tiles. Bonus tiles can be acquired when regions are exhausted and are given using a majority scoring mechanic - all very Euro-y. 

A bonus scoring mechanic exists similar to Thurn & Taxis, whereby points are earned for having 1 of each scoring tile (1-6).

What makes Finca interesting is in the collection of Fruit, which is done via workers on a rondel. How they move and how much they collect though is dependent on how many workers they share the space with. So it is this area where the key decisions are made.

For me this is another must own light/mid euro although I give Vikings the slight edge if I had to pick 1 of the 2.

Great, light game we can bring out with almost every crowd.  Lack of (much) randomness means the heavier-game gamers enjoy scratching out every last victory point.

I think it's good 2-4 and that the 4 she played with was just not suited to the game.  Time will decide.

I loved the rondel mechanic in this game, but that is all there was it seemed.  After you use the rondel to acquire all the fruits you need you use them to pick up tiles that will score you points in the end.

There are a few special powers you can use during the game as well, but in general, move your pieces around the rondel to acquire fruit, and use them to gain tiles worth points.

I like the rondel mechanism in this, although the board is completely superfluous.  Lovely components, the wooden fruit is awesome.

I really like the movement mechanism. (It works very good and I liked it before in Emerald - but Finca works while Emerald does not.)
Unfortunately, Finca cannot be controlled without very deep thinking. Finca should play in less than an hour. I guess, some playing groups will easily double this time. So I am not going to play this with deep thinkers that want to control the game. And that's the reason why Finca is not a great game to me.

First impression (4 players) : Finca is a pretty basic euro game. There are some interesting tactical choices to be made during the game even though you can get far by just maximizing your actions to the max (always buy 6 pts and try to gain as many fruits as possible). Nice to play every now and then but nothing really special. There is added chaos with more players but it still might be most interesting with 4 players.

Oh my. Pure screwage in a £30 box...

Initially a Thurn & Taxis-lite, Finca's frankly ridiculous and irrelevant mechanic grows into an absolute beast of a game. Best, without a doubt, with just two (far too unmanageable with four), there's enough here to please both the analytical scientist and the tactical backstabber. Vicious, vicious stuff is the net result: and there's no wonder it was nominated for the SdJ. On a passing note, it's sort of pleasing to see a simple cardinal points scale rather than the endless messing around with triangular numbers.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Thankfully I grabbed a copy on the marketplace before prices began to skyrocket. This game continues to see consistent play, especially as a 2p game with my wife. We both love this game, it plays fast and when we play it is a very relaxed gaming experience. To this day I still can not recommend it highly enough. As far as my kids, my son really doesn't like it much anymore since we have so many other games to choose from now.

My older daughter on the other hand still enjoys playing, although she to usually will pick another game to play.
Hopefully this game will see a reprint, it is a great gateway/family/2 player game![/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent gateway/family game, simple rules and easy to teach.
- Plays well at all player counts, especially with 2.
- Very strategic in the 2p game because you can plan ahead when it comes to your movement on the rondel.
- High replay value due to the random order tile, bonus tile and rondel set up.
- Beautiful board, and amazing fruit meeples.
- This is one of the most relaxing games to play that I have in my collection.
- The perfect chill with a :tankard: board game.

First play and I was thinking it was neat and clever and I'd happily play again. Second play and I'd felt the game was explored. The wheel to pick up fruit provides some interest. The decision to pick up more or deliver what you have provides interest as well. But I felt the luck of the revealed tiles bore too large a factor, and the luck of getting to end the game provided too big a leapfrogging score. Pleasant, easy to teach, nice components, good family game no doubt. But you build an expectation of due reward because of all the interesting decisions, but then that expectation isn't delivered on. Still, very playable in the light end of the spectrum.

10/29/11 - Finca was a decent game with moments that make you pause to think about pressing your luck and grabbing some more fruit or to abandon grabbing the fruit and go for the victory points on the board. I would like to try it again now that I have a feel for the game. I'll give it a 6 for now.

RATING: 7
A bit different than the typical rondel mechanism in that you are not simply deciding which space you want to land on and hence which action you want to take.  You are also trying to leave a bad position for your opponents(s) as well as improving your efficiency by leaching of their position on the rondel.  Play can get quite a bit meaner than the bright friendly colors and graphics might have you believe.  Using fruit to screw your enemies is actually fun.  Who knew?

My only gripe is that the scoring system is a tad bland (turn in x pieces of fruit, get x points).

RATING: 8
I'm a sucker for cute bits, and I just love the little fruit-shaped pieces.  I always want to call the little green olives limes, though.  The game is simple, really.  You just move your farmers around to earn fruits and then turn in sets of fruits to get victory points.  Once in a while there's a sort of contest for most fruit of a certain type, which earns some bonus points.

This game was surprisingly fun for something so light.  Players are trying to gather certain combinations of fruits and deliver them using donkeys.  To obtain the fruits and donkeys, players move their farmer pieces around a circular fruit track.  In addition to trying to get the right fruits by landing on the right spaces, players can get lots of fruit by landing on spaces with other farmers, and players can go faster along the track (helping them get donkeys) by starting in spaces with other farmers.  The integration of these options, combined with a number of rule-breaker tiles, give the game a good deal of tactical decision-making.  Both the board and the components are visually striking, as well, which is definitely a plus.

A nice, short family game with really pretty bits.  By no means is this one a brain burner, but there isn't much luck to annoy the serious gamer either.  I really enjoyed playing this & can see it coming out rather often for my wife & I.  It plays 2 very well & can be explained in a couple of minutes.  I can definitely see why it was (deservingly) nominated for the Spiel des Jahres.

Before reading Matt Throwers nod to FINCA on F:AT, I had no real interest in this one. 

But I got it for Christmas since I thought it could be a good game for the whole family. And it was.

Great bits, exactly right length for what it is and somewhat challanging gameplay despite the light rules.

About the same complexity as TTR, ZOOLORETTO and CARCASSONNE.

Decent easy-to-learn gateway game.  Make decisions about which fruit to grow by moving your farmer pieces around a small fruit display, then match the types of fruit with demand tiles located on the 10 regions of Finca (the Mediterranean island of Majorca) to deliver your fruit to those regions to score the points on the demand tiles.  Quick and lively game play.

I finally get to play this at my local meetup since it's kind of a grails game now because of its OOP status. I could pay premium to own this game but I am glad I try it before I bought it. It is a solid game, but the mancala is the only mechanic in this game that might be worth the while. I can see this game as a training-wheel bicycle for Trajan. I can gladly know that I don't need to own this game.

This is a good introduction into the rondel mechanic. However, I have a difficult time finding where it fits. It's too light for my regular gaming group, yet the rondel gives non-gamers fits (actually made my mom cry, but she was tired at the time). The components are beautiful and the game length is nice - there is potential, but time will tell if it finds its place.

RATING: 4
First play with 2 and now realise that the title is a play on words as this is more of a mental workout than implied in the rules read (or maybe it was too late in the evening for such a brainburner). 

As play progressed I could see that the design is a recipe for analysis paralysis as you assess the fractured holdings of your opponent(s) to compare yours to determine which majority bonus to go for. Trouble is the bonus tile is awarded when all the "orders" in the region it is in have been fulfilled. So you may or may not want to the region emptying quickly. Coupled with sequencing the majorities in your favour, you have to solve the puzzle of the rondel which allows you to collect the fruit needed for the orders. Movement is like that in Emerald so another source of AP.

As all information is out in the open, the only source of uncertain tension is if your opponent(s) have mentally seen your tactics and strategy to get ahead and beat you to the punch. But even though the scoring values are fixed, your scoring status becomes more fractured so any excitement in the race will only come from the mental arithmetic. HiG should have included the compulsory scoring track to reduce the mental workout and at least generate some racing excitement for this "Thinka" of a design.

I think there is probably too much randomness in this game for it to ever be a big hit with me but I really enjoy the windmill mechanic. Each decision you make when moving around the windmill has long-lasting consequences and you make many many such decisions throughout the game. This keeps me engaged from start to finish. The way the point tiles come up can really screw you or benefit your opponent though, depending on your positioning on the windmill. I've yet to find a way to overcome this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really quick playing and strategic pickup and deliver game. The core mechanic is quite abstract. You stand workers on the tines of this windmill, and move a worker X spaces where X is the number of workers on that tine, and then pick up X of the fruit he lands on where X is the number of workers on the tine he now stands on. Then, you deliver in specific amounts to the towns, and there are points for the delivery tile, and later more points for the leader in the overall delivery of each fruit type.

I'll put the conclusion first: I've really taken to this game, and so has my wife. I believe that all of my plays have been with her, save one. So it's a couple's game for us. 

I have only ever played it two-player and cannot comment on how it is at 3 or 4 players other than to speculate that I wouldn't like it nearly as much. Mainly because the central action gimmick is a rondel that sees you moving farmers in order to collect different types (and quantities) of fruit. The more players there are, the more the rondel changes between your turns. At 2p this is perfectly acceptable and you can plan around it. I cannot imagine saying the same thing with a higher player count. 

At heart the game is a very simple set collection game, and that's intuitive. I don't think it's a world-beating, best-in-class Euro by any means, but it's solid and breezy and is fun. We love food, cooking, and gardening in my household and so those are the themes that appeal the most. Your mileage, as always, may vary. 

Houserule the number of fruits at 2p. The rules do not say to do this, but with a full complement of fruit meeples at 2p, there's a lot less tension. I wouldn't go higher than 14 of each type, and the closer you get to ten the more vicious the "return all the fruits of one type when your opponent goes to take one that's not available" rule becomes.

Too abstract for my taste, but is occasionally quick enough (when players are not forced to discard resources or carriages). Also has huge swings in points; getting or not getting a single tile might easily give 10 points for someone while taking away 10 from someone else, essentially costing 2-3 positions in a four-player game.

Fun game, great components, small board. Theme is cute, I like the modularity of the setup.

The game has quite a different feel when you play two players versus four. With two, you can look at the position of the workers on the windmill and plan things out a bit: "If I move this one here, then he moves there, then I can do this..."

In a larger group, it's much more tactical, there's just too much going on and you just have to do the best with what you're given. It is still fun to play with more players, but the game feels different and more chaotic.

The map is just a place to put the fruit tiles for the deliveries. There's no spatial element. The various regions have no relationship to each other. This makes the game feel like a thinly veiled abstract, but the cute wooden fruits and colorful feel overall do add to the ambience of the game.

I like it. I think there's enough randomness in the setup that each play feels different from the last, and it's easy to teach, quick to play, and interesting decisions to make on when to use action tiles, which worker to move to which position on the windmill, and figuring out what combination of deliveries will work to your best advantage.

2012-10-07 - R: 7

Played our first 2p game this morning. I told my wife to expect something similar to Jaipur, but because everything is open (including how many fruits everyone has), the actual play feels very different and there are more opportunities to analyze things. This slows the game down a bit (compared to Jaipur).

Pretty, fun, easy. Starting with a 7 and we'll see where it goes. I've heard there's a lot of strategy you pick up on after repeated plays. I expect this one to eventually fill a similar niche to Traders of Carthage.

2012-11-06

Played two more times and on the last play the strategies came out in really fun ways. My wife and I were in a rental condo while our floors were being redone. We brought this game with us and maybe it was just that camping feeling you get when you're living out of a suitcase but we had a great, romantic game. It was still vicious - as are most of our games - but also fun, tense and full of interesting decisions. My favorite game mechanic is the way they handle running out of resources. If you are owed a fruit or donkey and the inventory is empty, everyone in the game (including you) must return that item to the pool and then you get back the number owed to you. In our last game, I crossed the "donkey line" onto a fruit I didn't actually need because there were no donkeys left. This forced my wife to give up all of her donkey tokens so she couldn't make the delivery she was planning.

Great game. Leaving it at a 7 for now, but I suspect it could end up an 8.

Wonderful game with just the right amount of tactical choice. Moves feel meaningful; and big sales feel like earned accomplishments. Simple to teach with elegant mechanics. I usually dislike games with "bonus" tokens, but I found myself enjoying the challenge of trying to acquire them. Plus who doesn't like winning a game because you sold your figs more smartly than your opponent? Special action tokens didn't feel pasted on as some suggested. Felt in balance as a good way to catchup if you got into a hole. Note: not super keen on the special action tokens being worth two points at the end of the game; but in no way "breaks" the beauty of the game.

This game is enjoyable but it is rather simple.  I do think there is still a ton of strategy to be had and believe it is a game that would work with a lot of different people.  I think some bigtime gamers could still enjoy this one, but probably wouldn't ask for it every time.

Finca is simple and delightfully frustrating.  The neat use of a rondel, where each piece must move the number of spaces as the other pieces on that space, is unique, and even though it is a simple mechanic, it can sometimes be frustrating.  

Finca seems like it would scale well from two to four players because the number of workers each player moves on the rondel varies based on the number of players. I would be very interested in playing Finca with three people because it seems like the desirable chaos of the rondel and the ability to strategize based on the available information would be optimized with three players.

The copy I played with had been pimped with three inch tall plastic donkey toys to replace the donkey tokens.  It made the game a lot more fun.

Nice solid game with lots of components but simple mechanics. The heart of the game is the windwheel where you move your workers to collect one of six types of fruits. The other option is to deliver them to farms satisfying their demand in order to score points, the key being where you deliver and the timing of the delivery. There is really not much else and the game works very well with only these simple elements.

Interesting rondel-based movement where the number of farmers on your start space determine the spaces to move, and the number on your end space determine the number of resources acquired. Resource acquisition and tile collection. Either too complex or too chaotic to form a strategy -- the board changes too drastically from one turn to the next. Need to try it with the Spiel Box expansion.

This is a very elegant, and very competitive Euro game. Think of one of those race games where your pieces move a number of spaces equal to the number of pieces on their space - well there is a rondel that works like that and it generates resouces (different crops and carts). Use the carts to trade the fruit in for delivery tokens - ensure you put together the right sets of delivery tokens to get bonuses. This is a simple and elegant Euro and I don't remember being impressed this much on a first play for a while. I was genuinely surprised it was only a nominee in the Spiel de Jahre but then I realised it was 2009, the year of both Pandemic and Dominion.
So, its still a Euro, and where it does suffer is that it is very thinky, does little to mitigate points for players not doing as well, and has a lot of options for damaging another players position. If you want a tight, elegant, competitive, Euro with heavy tactical play this is a great choice (I'm not sure its as good as Tigris & Euphrates but the rules are definitely easier). It may suffer in a group of relatively mixed players.

This was an enjoyable game.  One of the first hobby board games that we played together a lot.  The rondel resource gathering was very interesting, but bred a lot of contention.  This was especially a problem when one of us would take the last of a given resource, which would make the other person discard all of their resources back the bank.  What an annoying rule!  The resource set collection was fun, but we eventually grew tired of this game and traded it away for Robinson Crusoe.

RATING: 8.35
Finca is an enjoyable game where players first move their workers around a wheel in order to pick up lemons, figs, grapes and other fruits before delivering these fruits to the different regions of Mallorca. Sound boring? Wrong! Gameplay hinges on figuring out how to move around the wheel more effectively than your opponents. Get the little wooden fruits and deliver them
quickly to earn the most points! This is a game that works with new players as well as veteran board gamers, both young players and old. Easy to learn but definitely tricky to win. A must have for your game collection.

Nagyon érdekes a szélmalmos (rondellás) mechanizmus, teljesen egyedi. A játék veleje, hogy mindenki hat mindenkire :) Ez egyfelől nagyon jó, másfelől teljesen kiszámíthatatlanná teszi az egészet. Pont ezért nem érdemes túlgondolni a lépéseinket, mert kb. végtelen számú kimenetel lehet (még 2 fő esetén is). Mégis jó, kis kompakt játék a Finca. Bátran ajánlható gateway-ként. Hátrányának rónám még fel, hogy a lapkák túlságosan összeolvadnak a tábla színeivel. Kissé sántít még a téma "ráerőltetése" a játékra (semmi köze a játék mechanikához). Persze ezen könnyen túl tehetjük magunkat, hiszen ízig-vérig családi játékról beszélünk.

At first play I thought it was really great and fresh. 
After more plays I'm not sure about that first assessment. Game play is very very simple and choices are few. Adding players does help make movement on the rondel more interesting but still very simple. 
It is a beautiful game with great bits, but at this level of thought I'm probably going to choose Ticket to Ride.

Excellent light-medium Euro with some of the best wooden pieces ever. The central mechanism which is a rondel works great and the fact that it allows for player interaction, is awesome! Very simple gameplay rules but I can see that with experience this game could become quite deep, as you start playing both offensively & defensively. The pick up and deliver is simple, the set collection is interesting, and the special actions are fun. The expansion is awesome since it adds a few nice twists into the Mix and a few more layers of depth to the game. Imo, this is one of those rare games that strikes a fine balance btw Gateway and gamer's game, so it can be played anybody. Finca is a fine addition to any Library.

A good light, quick game to play with infrequent gamers or new gamers. Low player interaction on the surface (not so I say), with plenty of blocking and denying opportunities. A decent challenge for starting or finishing an evening gaming. It's deeper than I first thought - lots to think about. Not sure how much replayability is there though. I certainly like the simplicity of the rondel. Much more control with three players and also makes a decent two player game, albeit a bit dry with two. I really like this game with three players, but unfortunately my enthusiasm was not shared by those around me.

The rondel-ish movement is pretty cool, but it's super chaotic with 4.

It's a bunch of just-okay mechanisms put together in a not-very-interesting package. Nothing I dislike, but nothing to make me want to play again. 

I think it would start to feel the same very quickly--and the new-each-game rondel gives only the appearance of change, as each game might be different, but it won't feel that way. 

"Hey, remember the last time we played this, when the orange and lemon were right next to each other? That was crazy. And this time the grape is next to the lemon! Man, that really changes my strategy!"

Had the opportunity to play this the first time with two players and enjoyed it very much.  Played it again with four players and feel it is a better game with more.  Either way, would play it again whenever I had the chance.

With a few more plays under my belt, I am liking this game even more.  It scales well from two to four players, although there is a bit different feel between them.  The rondelle and delivery mechanisms work well and there is some strategy going on as well.  Do I go for the higher point deliveries, or try for the run of 1-6.  If I complete this delivery, it will actually give my opponent 5 VPs.  Having played both this and Hamburgum, there are some similarities there.

Above all else, a very well produced and enjoyable visually pleasing game.

RATING: 7.5
A game about producing fruits and vegetables and delivering them to Spanish provinces using mules. The game has two parts, the "rondel" and the map. Each turn you can either make produce on the rondel or deliver produce on the map.

The rondel has multiple spaces each with a different product on it. Players put three of their meeples onto the rondel. On your turn, you pick one of your meeps and move it clockwise. You move it a number of spaces equal to the total number of meeples on your starting space (including the meeple you are moving). Where it lands, you gain one or more of the product indicated on that space. The number of product you receive is, similarly, equal to the number of meeples on that space (including your newly moved piece). You take the products into your player area.

There are two mule "lines" around the rondel. Crossing one lets you take a mule tiles.

The map has stacks of delivery requirement tiles in each province. Only the top tile on each stack is face up. These tiles show a set of requirements, such as two figs and one lemon. The tiles also have a VP amount listed. To deliver food, you must expend a mule tile, and you must have products in your player area matching the delivery requirements. You can deliver to multiple provinces as long as the total produce delivered is six or fewer. To complete the delivery, put the delivered produce back in their respective pools, and take the tiles you fulfilled. Turn over the top of the newly showing tile stack(s).

The game ends after a certain number of provinces have had their stacks depleted. Winner is the one with the most VP. There are some tiles with odd delivery requirements (one of each type of produce), and there's a bonus for have at least six tiles covering the spectrum 1-6 VP.

The game also includes four rule-breaker tiles that can be played once for game. One of these, notably, allows you to deliver 10 products in a single turn instead of 6. The others are mostly for manipulating your meeple positions on the rondel.

It's a good game. The rondel is a fine mechanic,  although it's arbitrary and dry.

2009: Excellent little sequencing game that is let down by the randomness of the hidden scoring tiles,  Unfortunately, any alternative system would destroy the lightness of the game and turn it into a hellish game of AP.  As it is, it's an obvious SdJ contender as a lovely family game.

Interesting, innovative game using a revamped Rondel wheel, where you have to watch what other people are doing to ensure they don't steal the sets you're aiming for from you, and also time when points are scored. The key is predicting where people want to move, and setting yourself to benefit the most from them. No spatial consideration at all on the board; just tussling on the Rondel.

But damn, this is Exhibit A of pasted-on theme in Eurogames. The mechanisms are completely unrelated to the theme and would have worked seamlessly with a sleek abstract style. The game is really just a circle, a grid (or some other demarcation of spaces) and colors, and all that thematic fluff detracts from the abstract elegance, and that is something that really annoys me. Still, a little credit for at least pasting on a theme that isn't common.

Very neat and a nice surprise - not to mention it plays great with two!

No idea what did I just play. Uhm. I did the best I could, I didn't plan much (not that you can), I just tried to do the best thing while looking maybe 2-3 turns in the future. I the end I've juggled myself first place, but have no idea why. 

The good part of the game is that it's pretty streamlined and straighforward. Worse part is that I had no feeling I was playing with other players and had no idea where do I stand in comparison with them (3 player game). It's funny as other players do influence you and you influence them and yet I felt like I was playing my own game and had no idea how well I am at it. 

Basically it's just set collection turned into points and the then the points tiles also form sets that get turned into points (huh?). Looks neat and evocative with no tension, no narrative and drenched with tactical play. 

Rating down to 1.0 because: uninspired. Yeah it's a crime.

Played 1 3P game. Finca is a lightweight and streamlined Euro. There are some interesting tactical decisions to be made in moving farmers along the windmill, although it can be possible to overthink moves along there. Unfortunately, the game is let down by the uninspired and repetitive process of converting fruits to points. The board's artwork, while attractive, makes it difficult to scan for the demand quickly. Finca undoubtedly has its fans, but the yawn-inducing gameplay is a disappointment for me and the group I played with.

RATING: 5
This dull pick up and deliver Euro is the quintessential example of a 'german' gaming system where a mechanic drives things more than theme.

Players move their meeple on a round rondel in order to pick up fruit. They then deliver this to acquire VP token. Toss in the usual 'special ability' tokens (lazy game mechanic in my opinion). There's some vague uninspired fluff about a 'fruit-picker in Mallorca' theme.

There's hardly any player interaction, barely any agonising decisions to make and it's all rather procedural.

Everybody should own this game. It's great for friends and family, gamers and non-gamers. The game itself is bright and colorful and eyes always light up when they see the 134 wooden bits.  The rondel mechanism is easy to explain, so game play is really straight forward to new players and moves along quickly.  This game would have been "Game of the Year 2009" and would be sold today in Target stores if it had a different name and better box cover!  

This is one of the best "gateway games" and I have used it introduce so many people to the hobby.  That says a lot because I have not had the same luck with games like Carcassonne, Settlers of Catan, or Ticket to Ride.

It is a nice idea to implement Mac Gerdts' rondel into some new types of games.  Here it is the driving force in a little set collection game.  Now they've put some new twists on the system, they've set the rondel up on shuffle and instituted ownership of three different markers that move around the circle, and constrain movement and acquisitions by using a Mancala style group determined system.  Fresh ideas. 

Sadly, the game itself is nothing more than a basic set collection game where all the options that you are presented with are determined randomly (goal chits) and all the ways for you to achieve them are determined by what you are left with on your turn.  It is very difficult to plan your moves, as most every achievable action is determined entirely on whatever other players have left you with.  

It isn't even clever enough that players would intentionally leave you in certain ways.  Despite the extreme resulting interaction of other players' actions, most of the best options for a player are vaguely clear (land on this space to get the most fruit or land on that space to get the fruit that is really needed), but keeping track of your own progress is rather silly from turn to turn (as goals keep getting fulfilled before you can score them resulting in an extremely tactical game) so trying to position yourself to bone other players is almost absurd. There is so little control, that you just have to take the best options that you are presented, and your decision tree is often that of quantity vs quality or efficiency vs expedience other players might as well be and artificial intelligence piping their sequence in from Mars.   

I want to like it, and think it might be fine for other people, but it does nothing for me.

The rondel is more interesting than it looks. My rating is based on the "for what it is" scale, but it could go down if the replay value ends up being poor. This deservedly lost the SdJ.

This is just a basic, fun game to play. Not a lot of burning brain cells, but by the same token, capable of employing a few of them to work out a discernible path to victory. One's turn offers a limited number of possibilities. You can only move a single farmer. Determining which of your set to move (three to five, depending on the number of players) will be based on what each farmer can accomplish and whether or not that accomplishment will assist you in attaining a variety of short or long-term goals. The establishment of these short and long term goals is, in turn, based on the availability of certain resources (fruits, in the parlance of the game) at any given point in time.
It's a process of "What's out there to grab? What do I need to grab it? And if I'm not in a position to grab it right away, how do I get into that position rapidly?" I suspect that it will reveal some initially hidden layers of strategic complexity as plays of it increase, but appears unlikely to ever promote analysis-paralysis.
Don't check your brain at the door, but tell it to sit down and relax for a while,until you need it.

I enjoy the rondel mechanic in getting fruits and the strategy required to fulfill the obligations.  It can get a bit chaotic to plan what you're going to pick up, but I guess that's some of the fun.  A quality game for sure, but not amazing.

UPDATE: I will add that this a wonderful game for lighter gamers, as it has relatively simple mechanics and great bits.  Given that there is some nice strategy here, I don't think you can go wrong in getting this unless you only have deep gamers in your group.

Set collecting game with a rondel and anti-hoarding rules that probably ought to be stricter. I like the rondel, but I found it difficult to plan anything but the most basic strategy with four players. BGG says it's better with fewer, but there's lots of competition in the 2p slot. Quality components aside, I don't see myself wanting to play Finca 2p over similar alternatives, though it's a pretty good design.

Not great, but not bad, either -- I can see why it might be a SdJ nominee (although I wasn't surprised that it didn't win). I kinda like the rondel mechanism, although most of the time it feels like you have very little control. And I really like the fruit-shaped bits!

Surprisingly my favorite new game in a while. I love the juicy, colorful fruits, the windmill and the whole fruit collection mechanic, and the delicious decisions with each turn.  It might have my favorite all-time components with the thick fruit pieces.  Can play with younge gamers and casuals too.  One of the rare games that works great with two, three, or four.

This games has very beautiful components, to notch really that add to the look and feel of a very pretty game.

I think I was expecting more from the game because of the fact that it was a SdJ nominee.  At its heart it is a set collection game where your workers travel on a rondel, determining the resources that you obtain during your turn.

It is a light game that can be quick, although due to the way movement and reasource collection is done, keep tabson your AP prone players.

It's a pure euro game. I like the "rondel" mechanism. It's clever and must be used properly. It has a bit of luck involved when getting the fruit tiles because they flip randomly and players could happen to have the fruit needed to deliver. Anyway, it plays fast and it's one of those games where players can make the game to end soon if they think they're going to win.

Played with three players. It gets much better because the interaction on the windmill makes much more sense. It could end very quickly though.

Decent Euro game about fruit harvesting and delivering to villages (fincas), better with 3 or 4 players I believe than with only 2 but playable with 2. I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would after reading the rules since the theme is so-so but the mechanics are kind of fun (though not mind blowing). Sadly, it can come with a "richer-get-richer" mechanic, at some point in the game being ahead in points will most likely get you more Fincas and therefor win the game, a going through the motions happens. That is not happening in all games but a possible scenario, otherwise I still like to play it.

RATING: 8.5
It looks like a simple, nice, fruit-delivering game.  It isn't.  Well, it is about fruit delivery, but it's neither simple nor nice.

On your turn, you can only do one of two things: get fruit or deliver fruit.  Yet there are half a dozen interrelated scoring mechanisms to contend with, plus the constant possibility of other players screwing you over.  (There's considerable screwage in this game.)  Moving on the rondel without carefully considering other players' moves is a deadly idea.  We'll see how it ages with more plays, but I'm very high on Finca at the moment.

To quote BGG user spiraldaddy, "If you want a light cheerful pleasure holiday of a game with an underlying strategic viciousness, look no further."

The epitome of eurogames: short, simple rules, abstract theme, pretty components and fairly decent game play. This isn't going to blow you away, but is entertaining in its own right. Certainly enough for 5-10 plays.
I found it somewhat related to Thurn und Taxis. You're basically collecting stuff, and at the right moment, you're turning this into victory points. Timing is crucial here, and it's easy to be caught by surprise when the game suddenly ends.
Would want to play again, but I think it's a bit too average for the Spiel des Jahres.

A great tactical game for 2p, growing less predictable with more players.  Bright graphics and fruit-eeples.  Need to play with reduced fruit numbers (18/15/12 for 4/3/2 players) to add some tension. The El Razul expansion is worthwhile. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is quite good, particularly for the 30-40 minute time slot.  The strategies are actually quite good, and hidden upon casual inspection.  basically it comes down to attempting to deny your opponents fruits from the rondel while collecting your own, and at the same time denying your opponents points for deliveries while collecting your own.  Both of the systems can (and should) be played to actively deny points as it makes for a much more competitive game.  The beauty part is the rule that when players tie for the most, those points are tossed from the game.  So, through play you can force scoring in areas where your opponents are tied.

Personally I think this one is best with 3, as it gives the most strategic play of point denial and acquisition.  With only two players you lose the benefit of active point denial.

You'd have to be a real AP sufferer to have a problem with this one; it plays quick and smooth, yes even when counting fruits and looking for point denial.  But we do play where, if asked you tell how many of a particular fruit you have--we play viciously but fair.

A decent enough game.  Light with a focus on timing.  Decisions are fairly straight-forward.  Probably a good family game, but I have a lot of those already so this one will not be joining my collection.  Still, I'd play it if asked, but I'm in no hurry to own it.

************EDIT********************

Forget what I said above!  This game is great.  Very simple rules, quick gameplay, and great use of a rondel.  Sure, the decisions may not be the toughest, but they are there.  The blind tile flip adds a bit of press-your-luck to the game as well.

This is a perfect family game that should have won the SdJ.

************EDIT********************

I've upped this from an 8 to a 9.  For such a simple game, there's a lot to consider.  What a perfect example of a medium-light Euro.  How did this game not win the SdJ?

************EDIT********************

One more edit.  I'm not going to adjust the rating, but I really don't recommend this with 4.  Its incredibly chaotic and you can't plan for anything.  I'll play it with 4, but I don't really enjoy it.  It's just too crazy.  That's probably why it didn't win the SdJ.

Usual comment with most Euro games: it doesn't really matter what the theme was, the game is all about some mechanic. Fruit is just something easy to remember (within reason, most of the players were not familiar with dates, seeing as they are pretty much non-existent in small town Canada). Since the game is just a mechanic, it just doesn't really hold my interest.

RATING: 7.1
The Euroy-Euroest of the games I've played, perhaps.

A rondel with 3 of your workers on it. You move as many places as there are people on the spot you start on and you receive as many bits of fruit as there are people on the spot on which you land.

There are a few interesting mechanisms thrown in that make the game interesting, whilst also keeping it relatively lightweight (it's a solid medium/medium-light Euro).

It has the danger to drag down into massive AP-ness when played with the wrong people, but played in the right spirit, it's a fun predecessor to Hawaii.

I actually very much enjoyed this, it's light and fluffy and would make an excellent gateway with a light pick up and deliver mechanic if you are in the market for that sort of thing.

Update: Azóta 32 partit játszottam ezzel a játékal a yucata.de-n. (A toplistán egyszer sikerült felküzdenem magam a 12. helyre a kb. 1700 Finca játékos között.)

A játék megítélése is megfordult azóta bennem. Mostmár átlátom a stratégiákat és a taktikai jelleg mögött igenis vannak stratégiai lehetőségek. Bár ehhez kellett néhány partit játszanom.

Még mindig nem ez a legkedvesebb játékom, de mostmár az a véleményem, hogy jó kis játék.

-------------
A játékélmény tekintetében nekem az Oregonhoz hasonlít: amikor soron vagy, nagyon korlátozott lehetőségek közül választhatsz. Így a játék a bottom-up gondolkodási módot támogatja, de én top-down módon szeretek gondolkozni.
(top-down = kitűzöm a célt, és kitalálom, hogy hogyan érhetem el,
bottom-up = a rendelkezésre álló dolgokból építkezek, és remélem, hogy ezáltal nagyobb dolgok elérésére is nyílik majd lehetőségem.) 

Csak szüretelsz folyton, aztán időnként kiszállítod a gyümölcsöket. Amikor szüretelsz, mindig csak egy féle gyümölcsöt tudsz szüretelni, és csak 3 lehetőség közül választhatsz. Ha egy adott gyümölcsre van szükséged a 6 féle gyümölcsből, akkor nem igazán tudod úgy intézni a dolgokat, hogy annak a szüretelését választhasd.

(Ez a következő játékmechanizmus miatt van: a tábla sarkában egy körben van 12 mező. Minden mezőre egy gyümölcs van rajzolva. A 6 gyümölcsből 2-2 mező van véletlenszerűen elrendezve. Mindenkinek van 3 bábúja (4 játékosnál) és azokkal ezeken a mezőkön lépdel óramutató járásának megfelelően. Az általad kiválasztott bábúd annyit léphet, ahány bábú (ellenfélé is) található a kiinduló mezőn. És annyit léphet, ahány bábú lett azon a mezőn, ahová érkezett. Na, most gondold el, hogy meg akarsz szerezni mondjuk egy citromot, de a bábúid csak meghatározott helyekre léphetnek, és hogy melyikre, az nagyban függ attól, hogy a többiek melyik bábújukat mozgatják két köröd között. Ezért szeritnem gyakorlatilag lehetetlen előre tervezni, ha meg akarsz szerezni egy gyümölcsöt.)

Viszont az igaz, hogy nem kell sok dolgot meggondolnod, amikor rajtad a sor. Ha nem zavar, hogy nem látod előre, hogy a beszerzett gyümölcsöd mire lesz jó, és arra hagyatkozol, hogy majd csak lesz olyan megrendelés, amelyiket tudod vele teljesíteni, akkor el lehet vele szöttyögni. 

Pozitív tehát, hogy a korlátozott lehetőségek miatt pörgős a játék. De a legpozitívabb, a játék kivitelezése: A gyümölcsöket megtestesítő fa jelzők a gyümölcs formájára vannak vágva: narancs, citrom, füge, szölő(fürt), olivabogyó, mandula. A játék tematikája is jól illeszkedik: szüretelünk, és a falvakból érkező megrendeléseket teljesítjük.

First time i read about it, i thought "Geez, another Collect Resources & Spend Them Game" and in actual fact, it is. But the Fruit Collection mechanic is pretty fun and the gameplay (for 2p anyway) is pretty quick. So I find Finca a light, resource-management game. As easy and accessible as TTR, but with a Collect/Spend theme.

In some ways, Fruit Collection reminds me of Card Draws in Cartagena - you move one of your Farmers to a space. He collects X Fruit from that space where X = number of Farmers in that space. So there's plenty of manuevering to get lots of Fruit in a single Action, and denying opponents to collect lots of Fruit on their action.

However, the bulk of the game is pretty pedestrian and overall I was pretty underwhelmed by Finca. I'd play again, but I won't be going out of my way to do so. This strkes me as one of those middle-of-the-road games that is quickly consigned to the back of the closet.

Disappointed with this game.  This is one of the few times I was led astray by Rahdo.  Components are top notch and its a good game to play with my daughter, but I don't foresee ever wanting to play with anyone but her.  Not enough depth.  Very tactical, which isn't a bad thing, just not my taste.

Finca features beautiful artwork, yummy wooden pieces, and a movement Rondel with a dash of Escape from Pompeii.  This is a tactical game with a fair bit of luck, but it feels just right for a light evening.  There are about a million bits, so setup and takedown are the only downside for such a breezy experience.

RATING: 7
Set collection with a rondel mechanic. The board is not really necessary except for the rondel. Good components, the "fruiteeples" will not get the same fame as the famous Agricola animeeples, but they look good. Very light game. Played with two players which worked very well. With more players, it will probably be more chaotic and less planning will be possible. 

Edit: Played with four and it was _not_ too chaotic.

RATING: 7
Very good game. Plays great with two and scales very well. On your turn you only have two options - pick up fruit or deliver fruit - so it's very easy to learn. But there are multiple ways to score points when delivering fruit, so there's enough depth to make it fun for experienced gamers.

Update: I think I was wrong about this game scaling very well. It seems too chaotic with more than two players, and someone can easily get locked out of the tiles they need, especially in order to make complete sets.

Very good game for two players, but this just didn't make the cut when compared to some of my other light euros.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 2[/b]
With more players you're not able to plan ahead and the game feels entirely random. The zero-sum aspect of the two-player game is a lot more interesting.

Fantastic gateway game. The rules are simple. You can explain it in less than 10 minutes and you're off and running. The gameplay is fast. There's hardly any downtime between turns. It's got good puzzling elements, along with a perfect dose of interaction between players. This is a gateway/family game of a game.

Highly recommended.

This is how my father would have said the word "fink". 

A well designed game,  Finca deserves accolades in most every aspect of it's presentation.  The components are top notch - if not over the top - and the mechanics are unique,  in what is essentially,  a pick up and deliver game.

The introduction of a rondel - my first exposure to it - was a fresh inclusion,  that provided this title with an instant dose of character.  Add to that the gaudy wooden fruit pieces and it is quite apparent that every ounce of effort was applied in crafting this production.

With no cards or dice in sight and short of an imaginary wind - one might be left to wonder just how do the meeples move around.  Enter the windmill,  bringing with it a unique twist and quite possibly,  supplying us with that previously mentioned imaginary wind.

This mechanic was totally alien to me - and while at first I was enamored with it,  I did find it could cause a slight case of analysis paralysis,  when trying to calculate all of your possible moves and the cascading effects they might trigger.

Finca is truly in a class of it's own.  That doesn't make it the greatest game in the world,  but it is one that I think everybody should experience.

1 play with 3 players.  I enjoyed this game more than I have any buisiness enjoying it and the sum is more than its parts.  I like the decisions this game faces me with, but I think 8 is the ceiling and its all down hill as I have questions about its replayability.  I could be wrong, and will play soon to find out.  
 
The mini game with the windmill trying to get big scores while stopping big pay days of your opponent is fun system.  Reading has shown this is from a different game which I should investigate, but its new to me here and fun.  The timing and playing of players of the stock market of the fruit tiles and the attempts of trying to synergize. 

More tactical and less strategical to grab me, but as long as its not on the table too often I enjoy it when we play.

RATING: 6
Finca was a 2009 Spiel des Jahres nominee that tried to rework a Mac Gerdts-style rondel into a more family friendly game. The result is a fairly mundane affair of collecting wooden bits of various colors and converting them into chits worth victory points. I managed to win but didn’t feel as if I’d actually done anything to deserve the victory, which always leaves a strangely sour taste. Your turns are very simple with you either moving a figure around the rondel the number of spaces as there are units on the space you’re on and collecting an amount of fruit tokens equal to the number of units on the new space where you land, or exchanging previously collected fruit tokens for victory point chits. Clever moves were at least possible with a few one-time use special ability tokens, but all in all the game was fairly ho hum.

The gameboard of Finca shows the mediterranean island of Mallorca. Players try to crop and deliver the fruits of Mallorca (such as oranges, lemons, almonds, grapes etc.) by means of moving workers on a traditional windmill.

A pretty darn good game. Reading the rules, the mechanics look simple and rather straightforward, almost boring and dry. But the farmer wind blade movement mechanism is actually quite exhilarating and intuitive. Providing some drama and some tense moments.

Definitely worth playing with family.

A really good game with two players as well. The game scales really well. Will bump it up by 0.5

041611: with four players, the game is still great. The tension is quite apparent but there is less opportunity to make a skillful play and you cannot afford to hoard. I like this game as a light and fluffy piece, which comes out occasionally to whet my appetite for a heavier game.

We don't play a lot of pure Euros here, but this is a good one for two players. Overall, it's a tactical game where you manage rapidly shifting priorities, but - at least at 2p - there's some opportunity for strategy as well. The playing time is perfect at 30-45 minutes, setup isn't onerous, and the bits, components, and visuals are nice. It's a solid, thoughtful game without requiring [i]too[/i] much time or energy - a good weekday night game. I haven't played with more than 2p yet, but I fear it would get too chaotic and lose some charm in larger groups. 2p seems perfect for Finca, though I hope to try it with more at some point.

I can certainly see how more dedicated Euro fans would rate this one higher. Solid game.

Very good light/medium-weigth game. This game is a hit with 2-4 players, successfully introduced to family members and non-gamer friends. I like the colorful fruit bits, the interesting mini-game at the rondel, and the set collection when delivering fruit. It is nice to have some games that I can play with about everyone, while still enjoying the game myself as well. Only thing I don't like is how game-end is triggered (no final turns for other players), which has less impact with fewer players, which also is the reason this game is best with 2.

An unexpected surprise. Thought I was going to hate this and it was pretty good.  As others have noted, a pleasant game - something you can play with a spouse or non-gamers.

Finca is one of the most beautifully produced games in my collection. The board is gorgeous, and the fruit meeples (freeples?) are so delightful that just looking at the oranges improves your vitamin C. 
Unfortunately however it's also one of those games where the board can change so dramatically between turns that it's almost impossible to form any kind of meaningful long-term strategy. I've only played Finca with 4, but I'm beginning to suspect that it might only really shine as a two-player game.

Holy boring repetitive crap, Batman!  Finca is pretty much exactly like a million other games, only this one has different art and a different title like all the rest of these cookie-cutter boring pieces that seem to still sell despite my fervent wish for them to die.  In this one... well, you're on Majorca, which is obvious because... because... because there's fruit.  That you have to deliver to a market.  But there's very specific way to harvest this fruit, which is wandering around on windmill blades with your farmers.  And when there's a lot of farmers on one windmill blade, they want to go really far.  And when there's a lot of farmers on the blade they're moving to, that means they have a great harvest.  And when the farmers pass 90 and 270 degrees on a windmill blade, a donkey and cart fall out of the sky and patiently wait to deliver the fruit to market.

If it's somehow not obvious to you already, this is another game that has absolutely no connection to any kind of theme, much less the theme which is put on there.  Some joker thought of an interesting mechanic, used the random page finder on Wikipedia to find a theme, and then convinced a publisher to put nice art and components with this soulless mishmash.  And now it's Uncle Set Collector's Game of the Month for people to play and forget about by the time Essen rolls around again.

One two-player game, both newbies. The game has an idea, it looks good and so on. Our tactics were little bit straight forward and focused on short-term goals. I believe that the game has more to offer after a game or two and probably feels much different (and better) with three or four players. Looking forward to play more.

Updated after second play, now with four. The game felt better with four, even though I managed to play quite poorly. Decent game with good looking components, still looking forward to play a little bit more. Third game was similar to second, four players and I played poorly. :)

Updated after the fourth, rating from 7 to 6. Seems quite random, at least with four - it is not possible to have very long term tactics, I think. But it is quick.

Updated after the fifth play, quite soon after the fourth. Now there were three players, the game felt better - was it because of the number of players or fresh memory of some tactic, I don't know. Might get 7 again, if played more often.

Add couple of plays, the game is nice but nothing special.

One duel, not best with two players. More players next time or some other game. Looks nice though.

RATING: 7
So what did I thinka Finca?  I rather liked it.  It is a light game, plays quick and seemed to work nicely with 3 players.  The main mechanism is a "windmill" rondel that your wooden dude goes around picking up fruit equaling the number of dudes on the windmill blade.  You have two opportunities to pass a line a get a donkey token so you can deliver the goods to get VP chips that cost various combinations of fruit.  I would definitely consider picking this one up at some point.

Trajan is one my favorite games and part of its appeal is the way it takes the most ancient of games, Mancala, and turns it into a fascinating efficiency puzzle. Finca is another game to explore this mechanism. Players deploy their pieces on a resource windmill and on their turn, they pick up one of their pieces and move it a number of spaces equal to the amount of pieces originally on the tile. When they land, they take resources equal to the amount of pieces on the target space. Every turn sets up the next and to do well, you have to plan three or four turns in advance.

Scoring is also very interesting, with players being rewarded for collecting specific combinations of resources. Of course, there are bonus points for specialization in specific resources that may or may not be scored by the player that triggers the scoring. It's quite the puzzle figuring out when and where to score, since often emptying a territory of contracts can score points for your opponent.

This is one of those five minutes to teach and a lifetime to master games, so for that I give it a huge thumbs up. (Not to mention the bits are amazing.)

First and foremost, the components in this game are amazing. I adore all the colorful little wooden fruits. It's also refreshing that players actually receive more rewards for landing on the same space as another player, in contrast to worker placement games where players block each other.

I find Finca just one of those games I can enjoy nearly anytime with anyone. It's so easy to teach that I would recommend it first as a 'gateway game' to initiate one into the  beauty and pleasure of board-gaming. There is a level of 'planning ahead' that must be employed to really get the most of Finca, and that is tempered with the 'revealing of a new fruit tile' after each delivery to give the game just enough 'surprise' to possibly alter one's plans without squelching them altogether. The collection of fruit one accumulates could nearly always be useful. Finca is a keeper in my home.

May be Liz's favorite game.  I love the rondel and the control you have over ending the game.

I like the windmill (rondel) mechanic. You move a pawn as many spaces as the number of pawns on the space. Movement system similar to that first used in Bantu in 1955.

Just ordered this game with my Christmas money, and cannot wait to have a physical copy to play! This game has everything I want - medium strategy, replayability, 2-player friendly, easy to learn, and even a nice pretty board to complete the package. I have a feeling that with some more plays, the rating on this may go a bit higher.

Very interesting Eurogame, with a great mechanic for moving your farmers around and obtaining the fruit you need. Excellent - should have been Spiel des Jahre.

Great game!  My wife and I have played it many times and keep coming back to it.  Very fast play, but still rewarding.  There is definitely more strategy when playing with two, as four players can get a little chaotic.  Still fun with all player counts, and I would highly recommend this to both non-gamers and gamers alike.  Great game!

This is the first pick up and delivery game I have played so I don't have anything in that genre to compare it against.  I also haven't played [gameid=3452] which apparently uses a similar movement mechanism.  Movement around the windmill is essentially the crux of the game.  It is simple and strategic.  By watching what fruits are available for delivery along with what fruits your opponents are picking up, you can slightly interfere with their plans through manipulation of the farmers.  Long term planning is critical in order exhaust the finca request tiles to win the bonus tokens.  The action tiles need judgement on when to use them.  Since they are worth 2 VP's each at the end of the game, their use must accumulate more than 2 VP's or prevent more than 2 VP's from entering your opponent's hand. 

There has been some discussion regardng the "anti-hoarding" rule - if there isn't enough in the supply everyone returns everything.  Then the one collecting picks up theirs.  I think some sort of anti-hoarding rule must be in place.  I reduced the number of fruits by 4 per missing person to 10 of each kind total.  With two players, 18 fruits is a lot of one type.  Split evenly, nine is a hoard in and of itself.  Ten fruits of each might be a little tight for two, maybe twelve, but eighteen seems like too many.  I guess it depends on how much of a potential for major screwage you like in your game.
 
In the end, this is a quick game that is fun to play.  I just need to find a faster way to set-up to make it less time consuming!

6.5 after 1 play

Main game mechanic of the rondel movement is fun and increases player interaction, but it also limits the game's scalability. Any number of players above two increases the chaotic feel of the game, with four players probably the worst. While the artwork is nice, the choice of colours can make checking of majority for various fruits a little difficult, especially with more players. This again affects the scalability. There is a substantial uncontrollable luck factor when it comes to making deliveries, as the next order tile revealed may be exactly what the next (or next few) players need. Game component quality is ok. Heavy suspicion that the game is really a 2-player game.

I'm beginning to appreciate "light but deep" games more and more... and this seems to have a nice bit of thinking/planning despite a relatively short rule set.  Setup looks a little heavy but the short playing time shouldn't make that a problem.  I finally bit the bullet and bought one in an auction that wasn't too expensive and am looking forward to playing it with the kids (they are really excited about all the cool fruits!)

Lovely production.  I like how Finca can be played quickly but still present you with tough choices (such as whether to deliver now or hold; whether to take a chance on gathering the same fruit as someone else in hopes of being able to fulfill the order first).  I guess a game can still be enjoyable even if it does not employ any new tricks of its own.

A fun game about picking fruit that has more strategic options than you first imagine. 'Making it up as you go along' was what the first game felt like, but after a couple of plays we were able to figure out how to work towards long term goals whilst coping with the almost constantly changing board.

Tetszett, kellemes hangulatú kis játék. Rajta a listán, feleségem szerintem örülne neki. Könnyű, relatíve gyorsan lemegy, pároknak ideális, de gondolom többen is jól játszható.

Megvettem, a számítások szerint tetszik a feleségemnek is. Ketten ráadásul elég taktikus is.

Négyen veszít a taktikusságából, de ilyenkor át kell váltani családi üzemmódba agyban és nem lesz gond. :)

The windmill mechanic is the only thing that's unique but it also happens to be very random (with 4 players). You cannot control it. And you just can't prepare a strategy before it's your turn which leads to analysis paralysis. 

The fruit delivery tiles are randomly put on each other in stacks so you can't see what is coming. This gets even worse when you try to go for bonus markers where you need a set of 1 to 6. You don't know where the next number will be if the particular tile hasn't flipped. 

Bonus tiles only give a player that is already doing well an advantage. 

The game is colourfull but the gameplay is bland. I just had no fun while playing this one. It's always the same thing you repeat doing.

Mostly tactical but I have a gut feeling that some Strategic thinking helps. Let others compete from fruits you decide to ignore, select a couple of +5 bonuses which you decide to try to get. You cannot play solitaire but should think other players moves at least one round forward in order not to expose yourself to donkey/fruit theft.

jeu très simple mais vraiment efficace dans lequel le joueur doit récolter des fruits et les distribuer dans l'île de Majorque; le thème et le matériel sont intéressants, même si la planche de jeu aurait pu être plus grosse; j'adore le système utilisé pour faire avancer les personnages sur les pales du moulin; partie courte et interaction indirecte entre les joueurs

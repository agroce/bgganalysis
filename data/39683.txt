GAME: At the Gates of Loyang
RANK: 236
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Let's face it, Rosenberg's 'trilogy' of games puts Knizia's to shame. This is the 'dryest' and more matheematical of the 3 but it's still a great design. I probably prefer it the least of the 3 but it's hard to mark it any differently to the other two
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Lighter than the other harvest trilogy games, but after a couple plays I realized it has more to it than I originally realized.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really enjoy playing this game. It is very colorful, I love the veggie meeples, and there is enough helper cards to incite player interaction and prevent it from just being multiplayer solitaire.

That being said, the down time is pretty incredible, especially in a 3p game (avoid this at all costs). If Loyang was a 60 minute game I would probably bump the rating to an 8, but for the two of us it is a 2 hour game at minimum, and almost double that for a 3p game. By comparison, we can quickly run through a 2p Agricola game in under an hour. I'm not interested in an Arkham-length Uwe Rosenberg brain burner. At that length, I would rather play another game from our collection like Mage Knight. Hopefully the game length improves with more game plays.

UPDATED 10-10-14: Played it again recently. I like it a lot but only as a 2 players game for now. I'd like to give it a try with 4 players using the 2-at-a-time rule so it plays like a 2 players game.

RATING: 5
On the fence with this one.  While I understand that it is a deep financial/economic game, it seems like the luck of the card draw (especially early on) is what ultimately determines the winner.  I will keep trying at it, but so far I have been underwhelmed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Economic game of short term gain vs. long term investment, with a farming theme.

The goal of the game is to score the most points by the end of nine set rounds, of which each round consists of 4 phases.  In phase one, you plough a new field and simultaneously harvest your already growing vegetables.  Phase two is a fairly unique card-drafting system, where you start with 4 cards each, and on your turn you can either discard a card into the common pool (with the possibility of later obtaining that card) or decide to keep ONE card in your hand and ONE card from the common pool.  So if you start with a crap hand or a great hand, well you're only getting (probably) one of those cards, although with some planning and luck, you could get one more of them from the common pool.  Phase 3 is the action phase, which is done solitaire style- you have several different actions to choose from, which can be done in any order.  Actions include: buying a two-pack of cards, which gives you more action flexibility, selling vegetables for money to your shop (a weak but sometimes necessary action), buying vegetables from your shop (expensive and therefore weak but sometimes necessary action), selling vegetables to either regular and/or casual customers (a strong money-making move, but not without some tradeoffs and timing issues), sowing vegetables you currently possess for future investments, using helper cards (which really are generally pretty helpful), and using market trading cards.  Phase 4 consists of buying points (using money), and it involves an interesting mechanism where the points are initially very cost-effective (when you of course don't have money to spare), but get alot more expensive as the game progresses.  

Well Uwe does it again, sort of.  I think this is the weakest of his big three, which is to say it's a really good game, rather than a great game.  My wife really likes this game as she does all of the other big three, so this game is getting alot of play time, and with more plays, strategy is becoming a bit more clear, although the card-draw randomness can be pretty significant.  Gameplay feels light, and I'd say this is the lighter than Agricola and Le Havre, although it's still a "gamer's game".  It's really a 2-player game that was converted into a 2-4 (1-4) player game; 2 players is great, 4 is ok, and 3-player, while still pretty good, has some real downtime (more than a 4-player oddy enough).  Components are good, very professionally produced for a new company especially, but suprisingly few components for the cost (I know economies of scale, and the whole bit, but still...).  This is really begging for a mass release, as it's a very accessible and interesting game- Z-Man to the rescue for the masses.

Initial rating. Will refine with subsequent plays.

UPDATE: This is a brain-burner, for certain. Personally, I frequently find action combinations that solve a problem I have in the game, but only after carefully thinking things through. Whenever I get "stuck" I keep thinking that there's a possibility to reason it out and get "unstuck." This kind of observation leads me to believe that analysis paralysis could develop... hence I would suggest a timer (loosely applied, in this case) for the action phase to speed things along.

This is not to say this isn't a FANTASTIC GAME... it really is. It's just that there seems to be creative ways to solve problems in which you find yourself -- something I really like about this.

At the Gates of Loyang is different enough from Agricola, but similar enough as well. While this IS a fantastic game, I don't believe that it compares to the heavier Agricola/Le Havre pair of games. It's easy to see how THIS game inspired Agricola (not the other way around, judging from release dates). Not a bad title by any means. I simply PREFER Agricola and Le Havre to this, that's all.

I think it's a shame this game is overshadowed by its "Harvest" brothers, Le Havre and Agricola. I would love to see an expansion! The game is great as a solitaire experience, and worth owning for that alone. As a deep two-player experience, it is one of my first choices. I wouldn't play with three or four unless really pushed into it.

It's another sprawling affair - this time with cards that take up alot of space. The rules system is interesting, but a touch unrefined. The card distribution rules are especially odd and overly done for such a simple effect. Also, it's excruciating to get money early on which dampens fun - until you understand the way of trade with vegetables and merchants . Later, money is rolling - which also dampens fun. The best moments are the middle game when you start to turn the corner from difficulty to smooth sailing. So all in all, a mixed bag for me. Additional plays are continuing to confirm and in fact lower my impression. Might end up on the trade pile.

Ok game. The only complaint is about the helper cards, which have a too tiny font. Now you can't easily see what cards the other players have and hence the only means of player interaction suffer from bad component design.

UPDATE 7/2010:
Absolutely best with 2 players. Interaction works much better. However, it's kinda sad that after 2 hours of playing, you've scored only 16-19 points at maximum. Somewhere around hundred could be more appropriate.


2013/01
It's just plain boring to finish with so few points after a couple of hours playing. You can't afford to lose even a single point or you're screwed. Make that mistake in the beginning and you know you have no way to fight your way back into the game.

Purchased for the two-player playability, the multi-player-solitaire-ability (I don't always want to be butting heads with J), the Uwe pedigree, and because it was $20. At first blush, seems "just okay"; we haven't played it enough to be able to use the cards against one another.

After further plays, I actually quite like this as a quick Rosenberg solo game. 

It certainly isn't as meaty or interesting to me as his other titles, but the play feels quite a bit different from his other titles, too (notwithstanding the harvest theme) such that I find I play this more than I might if it were simply a "lighter" version of [I]Caverna[/I] or [I]Le Havre[/I], for example.   

I'm interested to play it more frequently with more players to try the card-drafting mechanic, which in many ways is really the most interesting part of the game from the surface.

Poster child for multi-player solitaire optimization puzzle games?

Get this to turn in for that to turn in for victory points.

About the only tension I felt was during the card draft and even then, as long as the players were after something different, there is no tension.

I also did not like the turn order but that is because I am a slow player.
 
I may as well have been playing this alone. Maybe it's better that way.

RATING: 4
+ Cool looking pieces; I love Uwe!
- I really didn't get this game; No matter how efficient you are, games usually come down to a tie or difference by 1 point; Very anti-climactic.


Why it's previously-owned:
I love Agricola and thought this would be engaging in much of the same way.  The biggest problem is that basically no matter what you do, it's pretty much impossible to break away from your opponents by any more than 1 point.  Additionally, there was way too much fiddliness in this game for what you get out of it.
I gave this game away to a friend who seemed to enjoy it more than I did.  I much prefer Macao as a game that has a lot of fiddliness, but fiddliness that's worth it!

While it may sound harsh, in my opinion the biggest asset of the game is the huge amount of pumpkins and corn sheafs to be utilized in Agricola. ;)

Overall, I did play it a couple of times but it just doesn't offer the complexity like the other games of Uwe Rosenberg.

A very good and clever game, simple and efficient. The theme is fine, produce and sell vegetables on the market for your custumers, with a bit of luck, but a lot of choices you can do to avoid the luck dependency. A lot of good strategies, too, you can be agressive on loans to make a better use of your vegetables later, or you can be very economic and avoid loosing points for loans in the end of the game.

RATING: 5
Take Jambo, make the cards vastly less interesting, bring in the Antiquity mechanism, and make it repetitive.  Make it repetitive.  Make it repetitive.

The last bit isn't quite true -- the beginning is tense (you have no money and no stuff, and need to get it quick) and the middle is not bad (you have stuff and can make plans and money effectively), but there the arc ends:  there is no real "endgame" (other than a point of little return on field planting), just an extended middle.  That goes on a little too long.  Your business gets "good" but not "great."  Compare to Jambo, where the replacement of a fixed timer with the 60 gold Rubicon creates strong endgame tension and analysis of how to prepare a strong finishing hand, and whether you are well placed to end the game.

I think some optimization can be done and the luck isn't complete, but it isn't very exciting.  It's not terrible, just not that great.

Very nice and very similar of course to Agricola. Being a solitaire friendly game, it suffers from a lack of interaction among players. Yet, the mechanics, the graphic art, the colors of the game deliver a very nice experience. Personally, I don't know why, I have problems in literally reading the rules of Rosenberg's game. I find them always not very clear and not very helpful to easily enter the game. Yet, Rosenberg's games are excellent and once you grasp them they are always easy to manage and fun to play.

1-4(2)

Really, it's mostly an efficiency exercise in figuring out how to accumulate markets and customers and helpers and fulfill them in a maximal way, sort of like the Traveling Salesman Problem.

It plays this way, too. It's VERY solitary ... the helpers are only occasionally (and weakly) interactive, and the drafting has elements of this, but it's also weak. There's also a whole lot of bit-pushing, and a lot of it is just obligatory (as in, not requiring thought, just "doing what needs to be done"). There's also a whole lot of mental bookkeeping: remembering if you've bought a two-pack, if you've delivered to a regular (or not), if you've paid for your "free" point already, etc. All of which I think make what could be an interesting puzzle into something of a chore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A bit of a brain burner with some fidgety rules, but a very solid game once you get the mechanics down.

A fun puzzle-style game, large parts are multi-player solitaire. After five plays, I like it; in the same series as Agricola, doesn't look like it will have the same massive replayability.

The scoring track is treacherous: record scores with pen and paper as you go!

Only played 2p, and I have to say I think that's ideal, it's a long enough game; I might try 3p, but I don't particularly fancy the complexities of 4p partners.

Finally broke the game out after owning it for 5 years.  You can see how this inspired some of the key mechanics in Agricola.  Very muted player interaction, and it has a bit of a catch up mechanism to ensure that most games between good players will end up very close.  Not sure what a good score would be but nearly all of my games end up with a high score of 18 and an occasional 19.

I enjoy this game quite a bit as a 2 player game.  We've played it probably 6 or 7 times.  My chief complaint would be the way scoring works.

Given the game's length, I'd like to see my decisions have a bit more impact on the end result.

Rating based on two plays.

I didn't get much excitement out of this one.  It was a fair amount of work to plan out all my fields and which crops were going to be delivered to which customer.  But my opponent pretty much matched me action for action and we ended up pretty much tied.

There's not a lot of player interaction, and unless you are willing to gamble that you'll draw the right card at the right time it seemed hard to outplay your opponent.  So it lead to a dull stalemate.

(After various 2p games)
Nothing to do with his previous harvest games, a total different game.
Good game, a bit more luck dependant that the previous games (not a lot though).
Prone to some AP when dealing with the cards, as some people like to look to each possible combination.

Almost no interaction (some cards allow you to mess a bit with the other players).

The final production game will look gorgeous with so many vegimeeples :)

Will look for the solitaire game.

Definitely has flavors of Agricola, but feels much more tactical in figuring out how your going to optimize each turn.  You don't necessarily have a long term plan, you're just reacting to the cards.  Seemed long with 4 players, but that was the first play for two of us.  Rating may go up one with additional plays

A wonderful mid-weight euro that is accessible, puzzly, and still manages to feel refreshing/unique years after its initial release. The game has great tension, interesting decisions, and an outstanding production quality. And while there is significant randomness, it is somewhat controlled (drafting), appropriate for the weight/length of the game, and seems to add more to the depth of the game than reduce any players' decisions. 

Unfortunately, the helpers in the game end up being a double-edge sword. They add depth and makes the game more interactive. But they also create a situation where players must wait for another player to complete his/her turn. And often, players won't play their helper(s), which is why the other player(s) waited. Thus, the downplay is noticeable and somewhat more annoying as it is often in vain/unnecessary/etc.

Buen juego. Bien pensado, buenos componentes, mecanicas elegantes...pero no es de los míos. Para mí tiene el fallo de que en tu turno esperas a que tu rival juegue... a mí se me hace larga la espera; Incluso en mi turno me doy cuenta que tardo, y eso me molesta.

Pero, a mi mujer le gusta bastante lo que es un puntazo para mí. El arte gráfico y la calidad son una gozada. El precio alto pero hay veces que merece la pena hacer un esfuero y esta es una de ellas... Juego recomendable.

I've not played Splotter's Antiquity, so I'm not sure which bit of ATGOL it inspired.  However the clever aspect of this game is the card selection.  When to take and the consideration that you are leaving your remaining cards to be selected by your opponents.  There are a lot of decisions to be made and the choice of cards wide enough to cause AP for those prone to it.

The wooden bits and colour choice is very nice.  Interesting to see no tray - a few cents saved there.  Nice graphics all round.  Happy to play again.

Nekem kicsit csalódás az Agricola után. Szép ez is, játszom vele szívesen, de valahogy más kategória így elsőre. 

A játékélménytől függetlenül pedig: nagyon kevés az anyag a dobozban, főleg az árához képest. Mondhatni: túl drága:)

Van egy kiskapu a játékban (talán hibának is nevezhetnénk), amivel plusz 2 Cash-t szerezhetünk az elején (Kölcsönt veszünk fel, és lépünk egyet előre 3 pénzért). Ezt akár oda is adhatnák előre.
---
Na másodjára már sokkal jobb volt!
---
Újra előkerült: nem rossz játék ez, sokkal egyedibb, mint pl. az Agricola, DE nagyon monoton, feleslegesen sok a 9 kör. Ahogy egyik játékostársam mondta: nincs íve. Ugyanez az élmény lenne 5 körben is, csak akkor nem lenne az az érzésem, hogy "de hosszú volt...".
---
Nem rossz, nem rossz, de az Agricolában vagy Le Havre-ban sokkal több újrajátszási lehetőséget érzek. Persze amíg évente egyszer kerül elő, addig mindegy:)
Egyébként Oregonnal egy napon játszottuk, és az Oregon dobozába belefért a Loyang is, így nem kellett két dobozt vinnem... Azért az Agricolát nem nagyon lehetne belepréselni csak úgy mellékesen egy másik dobozba:) Hiába a sok zöldség, valahogy az az érzésem, hogy nincs benne anyag. Ennek ellenére horror áron volt.

Love, love, love this game! This is the best solo experience I have had with a game (along with Imperial Settlers). Addictive. Better even than Friday. 

My best solo now is Lvl 18 + 11 coins, with one more Lvl 18 in solo. Much harder to score really highly in this due (I think) to the need to pay for cards. 

Also now played quite a bit of two/three player on Yucata where it is easily my favourite game! Love the puzzle aspect. On Yucata, I have only scored below Lvl 19 once (and only just) and I have scored Lvl 20 twice.

Sorry to spoil the party, folks.  Two totally disconnected people staring down at mats, puzzling over dry spreadsheets about vegetables...is not a game.  Like an unhappy temp agency assignment, except you don't get paid.  This is a very discouraging trend so-called games are taking these days, and it's just not my idea of fun.

The third game in Rosenberg's "Harvest Trilogy" is quite different from its predecessors: there's no worker placement mechanic. After the first plays, the flavor of an extesively playtested product emerges (though the reading of the rules is a challenging task to accomplish): the gameplay is smooth, a little more tactical than strategical, and enticing... Maybe it's a little too long for what it is, but not a bad game.

9 rounds of doing exactly the same thing. while it was fun the first 5, by the end it got very repetitive. usually in games of this sort as time goes on you start doing 'grander' things, (like more interesting actions in agricola/more interesting buildings in le havre), so the games feels like getting prepared for the final rounds, here it was rinse&repeat for twice as long as I was really interested.

Loyang feels much more like a cardgame than Agricola or Le Havre.  It definitely lacks the long term planning and sheer variety that the other two games in the Harvest Trilogy offer.  Basically, Loyang is sort of a step in the wrong direction.  Why should I spend a lot of time playing Loyang when the later offerings are far superior?  I guess the answer is that Loyang is worth a couple of plays.  I do enjoy the harvesting and planting.  Trying to figure out how to satisfy your regular customers is an interesting puzzle.  The two pack also adds some excitement and fun, but it also increases the luck of the card draw. 

The main downside to Loyang is that it really feels like multi-player solitaire.  The Helpers add a touch of interaction, but they also provide a screwage factor that is hard to control.  To be honest, Loyang would probably be better with less interaction.  It certainly would cut down on the downtime.  Anyway, I'd like to entirely replace the interactive helpers with new helpers that don't screw people.   

Update: It turns out that Loyang is best as a solo game.

A moddle-weight game that relies heavily on crafting a strategy a couple of turns ahead.  It is reasonably forgiving of mistakes, so it is hard to pull away or fall behind too much.  In the last game I played, one player got one step ahead on the third round and ended the game one step ahead.

The components are excellent. I think it captures the theme well. It involves engine building with the way you sow your fields and then deliver to your customers. A very solid game. Offering solo play is always a bonus as well. After many game plays, it could feel repetitive as there isn't that much variety in what you can do. Not sure yet. Also, there appears to be a runaway leader problem. Not that there are huge gaps in scores but once someone gets ahead, it is really hard to overtake them. I may update once I get several plays under my belt.

First Play: Once the cycle of a turn is understood, you can get immersed very quickly into the strategies of this game. From that perspective, AtGoL has a much faster learning and appreciation curve than Le Havre. 

There is room for bluffing, brinksmanship, and some screwage, so this is not a plough your own furrow type of game. Keep your head down at your peril.

I was very impressed by this and look forward to more plays in the near future.

Second Play: Still a great game but enjoyment deminished by one player who added an hour to play through AP. Must use a timer in future to avoid this.

This game doesn't remind me of Agricola or Le Havre. It is it's own game and by any other designer, I don't think people would link it to the former as a trilogy. 

That said, I really love this game. It is the shortest of the three (in the trilogy) but have the same depth. You can plan some, but at it's heart, it is a hand management game with small hands to deal with. You must play this one a few times to really appreciate it. 

You don't get much in the box for the money, but the game play is worthy of it's cost. I would not recommend this game for non-gamers.

El tema está bien implementado y en mi opinión, transmite las sensaciones de comprar, vender, producir, comercializar, etc que pretende el juego. Se nota los intentos por minimizar el azar de las cartas, algo que personalmente agradezco, aunque la manera de hacerlo sea alambicada y un poco enrevesada, que es lo que desnaturaliza un poco el juego.

Still as a two player game there was enough interaction and strategic and tactical decisions to be made. No real brain burner but a lot of different options to maximize. Game can be a bit fidly with all the veggimeeples moving around but it certainly is manageble. Replay value seems good with all the possible card combinations so I'm looking forward to trying it again, with two!

Initial experience:

There are some clever mechanisms here that are enjoyable to work with.  But there is so much randomness that it doesn't really matter in the end.  Tight games are going to come down to who got the perfect card in their hand for their situation, and the player on their left throwing away a fantastic card for them.  If they can do that with a good turn-order, they're up for the round.

The common pool/turn order sounds like it would work on the surface, but once your inside you see how it doesn't work as smoothly as one would hope.  Either all players should play to their last card, or to their second card if there's something particularly juicy for their position.  Trouble is, even in a 4-player game, the players all need different things, so it's rarely a conflict when someone takes the card that is best suited to them.  In addition, players are throwing away their most worthless cards early on in the phase.  So the whole turn-order mechanism makes no sense.

The scores are so tight here, it's somewhat reminiscent of Power Grid.  Except in Power Grid, money being the tie-breaker is usually what wins the game - money is King, and based on the design, it makes sense.  Here, money is a by-product/end-of-the-refinement-process, and it feels a bit off to have the game be 19.5 -19.7-19.10, 5 coins made the difference between first and third.  This is the primary effect of the scoring mechanism, which doesn't so much stop runaway leaders, as guarantee that all players are going to be extremely close to one another in points.

The sowing/harvesting is great, an idea that has been around for a while in Rosenberg's games.  I had a great "credit crunch" game in which I owed regular customers more than I could handle, and needed to keep producing more and more, but when I grabbed two-fers, I got *more* regular customers, so I owed *more* goods.

That said, the randomness of those two-fers is *ridiculous* and simply breaks the game of anything interesting it may otherwise exist in this game.

So, while the sowing, harvesting, grocers, and customer mechanics are all good, they are all tied together by far too much randomness to be worth any while.  The good news is that the randomness is mostly resolved before your main action turn, so you can mostly plan around it.  But sometimes, randomness is a major player in the game - and I don't like playing with that player.

Better than Le Havre, not as good as Agricola.

11/24/09:

After two 4-player games, I'm done with it.  I might play it solo if I ever get the chance, but I will be actively avoiding instances of the game in the future.  When a game is forced to play this tightly (by scores), the randomness determines far too much.

I'd rather play Le Havre, I think.  While it's an uninteresting game, at least randomness doesn't play such a key aspect.

One play with 3 players and it was a lot of fun, but I think it had more to do with the players and the environment than the game.  It's an interesting game of combination play and a bit of turn order jockeying to maximize your return.  However, like other games from this designer it just doesn't flow for me.  It also seemed to me that the two packs were too important since your just getting two random cards, usually for one coin.

Love the vegetable peddling theme and the quirky mechanics, which don't really remind me of any other game. Once I'm familiar with the cards, I suspect this may drop to a 7, but for now, it's hot on my radar.

As suspected, it dropped to a 7. The randomness and fiddliness of the cards, which seem balanced at first, gets just irksome enough to drop this from a 10.

I never play eurogames gladly, as they are all about their precious rulesystems and don’t even care for theme, story, randomness, freedom and real interactions among the players: in other words, they’re too cold and highbrow for my tastes.

The typical example of such annoying games is Agricola, a deeply unthematic multiplayer solitaire so fiddly, dry and complex that I usually lose any interest in playing it (let alone winning) way before the first turn ends: so I wasn’t thrilled at all when I’ve been first invited to play At the Gates of Loyang, which comes from the same author as Agricola’s and openly tries to capitalize on the Arcadian vein opened by its more renowned and successful forerunner.

Yet surprisingly I found in Loyang one of those very few euros I can moderately stand, as long as I have to play them only once in a very long while: like its likes indeed, Loyang is opposed to fun and mirth but at least unlike those it offers a somewhat more thematic experience and looks a bit less abstract than most of the euros (and Agricola ahead of them all).

Of course I’m never a hopeful challenger when playing Loyang, but that’s another story. [i](January 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - The mere fact I haven’t been playing Loyang since my original comment (almost four years ago) - and haven’t seen any of my euro-friendliest buddies play either for that - means this is a game I can as well do without: so during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from 7 to 6, which will hold until I’ll have the chance to re-evaluate it. Not too soon, it looks like.

Only a couple plays, some solo, so far (and its great solo, btw) but I anticipate this being a big time keeper for me. As some have said, the action phase is pretty straightforward, and its the card phase that is the heart of creating your strategy. The scoring system is a clever way to make early money better than later, while removing money from the system, to keep it tight. For those iwth an issue with the scoring system, just think of leftover money, not as tie-breaker, but worth 1 point a piece, while steps on the path are worth 100 points.

Two games.  Jury's still out.  On one hand I like it more than Agricola because you get the satisfaction of fulfilling orders, instead of the constant grind-without-reward feeling in Agricola.  So the game is more "fun".  And it's easier to plan ahead in Loyang; while I normally like strategic games less than tactical games, I prefer even less those strategic games in which players can easily mess you up!

However the game is much more dependent on card draws.  In Agricola, if I get bad cards, I could just ignore them and still have a chance, because they're optional goodies that cost to play.  You can't make money in this game without cards, and getting the right cards at the right time can mean much more success over your opponents.  My wife was shocked to see how far ahead I was in our second game -- the regular customers just fell my way.

I like it, but games like this (and Agricola) will always be situational choices, never my favourites.  For this game, the "situation" is that it's very good with two players, and has the making-or-buying-then-selling-and-earning-money theme that my wife enjoys a lot.

I will say that the game is almost completely solitaire-ish, which my wife and I prefer anyway.  I'm tempted to completely take out the cards that affect each other -- while that would make it 100% solitaire-ish, the benefit is that we could then take our turns at the same time and probably shave off 1/3 of the playtime.

All right, I got to play this after moving it on to a new home.  It's not one I need to have (as someone in my group has it) but it was a good play.  We played with three and it is different enough from the other farm games by Rosenberg, I feel.  It took a bit to get into the swing but I did enjoy.

Loyang might make you neglect all the other games in your collection. The week after I got it, I played it every morning and night. That rarely happens, since I typically bring home 5 new games a week (it's research/product training for work, of course!).
I think of this as a gateway version of Agricola. Much of what makes that game so compelling is found here: Limited rounds, limited resources, limited cash, and an unlimited amount of things that you want to do. The key mechanical difference is that Loyang let's you take as many actions as you want per turn, as long as you can pay for them.
Luck of the draw is definitely stronger in Loyang. I've seen players make huge comebacks in the last few rounds due to receiving good hands while their opponents received nothing useful.
Watching my farm grow from a tiny pumpkin patch with a pathetic into a sprawling 8 field, money pumping monster
is one of the most satisfying experiences I've yet to have in this hobby.
An experienced player can teach this to a casual gamer in 5 minutes or less, another huge plus. 
Also a very good couples strategy game.

RATING: 5
So I have played Loyang about 5 times and I think I am done with it.  It's not a bad game by any means, but it's best played with no more than two and everything here is familiar to a veteran gamer, even the theme of growing vegetables.

The solo game works fine, but I am always skeptical of solo boardgames anyway, go play a video game or something.

For a two player game, the only real interaction is probably in the card drafting phase.  Here the game tricks you into thinking really hard about what to discard to the common pool, when in most cases your choices here have minimal effect.  The rest of the game is just optimizing your little farms, delivering vegetables and deciding what to plant.  You can play simultaneously for the most part.

It's all very enthralling while you play, but at the end you look up and see your score marker one space ahead.  You are the alpha farmer and all other pretenders must bow down to you.  Except that you just spent an hour pushing a little pumpkin token around while ignoring the person across from you.  How cool is that?

I keep this game for solo plays only. It's really good as a solo game and every game is different. A real brain burner trying to squeeze out as many points as possible out of every action. The quality of the game more than make up for the lack of components (which are good in and of themselves by the way). Might try this multiplayer someday but the multiplayer rules are kind of confusing.

RATING: 6
Underwhelmed.  Too much luck of the cards.  Whoever is lucky enough to get an early regular customer to fit with his "home" farm is in the best shape (he will have a faster money engine and less penalty for casual customers).  Another, luck of the cards issue is for the 2-pack action... which often turns out to be a waste of 1-2 coins.  The game is very restrictive and structured, but there's a ton of luck, and it's easy for opponents to mess with you... so in the end I just felt kind of annoyed with the game.

UPDATE 2011: there are so many little decisions that AP sets in, and I get lost in the minutia of optimizing a single turn.  The luck of the cards is somewhat mitigated by strategically choosing which cards to discard into the "pool".  That said, there's still too much chaos from luck and hurt-your-neighbor cards.

Another Rosenberg farming game, which I have to say makes Agricola look positively interactive, so if you don't like the solo elements of Agricola, you won't like this either. There's more room for AP here as well, so the game does take a long time. 

I'm not saying it's not engaging or interesting, cos it is, our 4 player game was close as we were seperated by 1 point so cash was a 3 way tie breaker. However, I think that there's better games, more exciting in the same time length,  or shorter for the same interest or whatever.

I'd pick Farmers of the Moor ahead of this if I were an Agricola player looking to buy something else by the same designer.

Solo record 17+17.

An interesting game with more depth than I figured it would have.  This game is a huge departure from Agricola and Le Havre, but I think that's a good thing.  Thematically it's lame, you're growing and selling vegetables but the game itself is pretty fun. 

I'm finding the solo game to be very random at times.  If you get a lot of not particularly useful cards in the purchase area, it can be quite difficult to know what to grow and hard to get your engine running.  I dislike not knowing what to grow and what I'm going to need later and not being able to formulate an effective short term plan that bridges to a long term plan.  I don't have this issue with Le Havre or Agricola, so I'm not sure why this is bothering me so much in this game (despite it happening the last two games in a row).

My interest in this has dropped off quite a bit.  I need to get some two player games of this going, but I find that there are quite a few other games I'd rather play with my usual two player opponents.

Played a couple of games 2-player.  We both thought it was ok, but not deep enough, especially given that we can play a game of Agricola in the same amount of time.  There is part of a good game here, pity it did not take it the rest of the way.  I'll likely pull this out and play it from time to time, but it's not going to be a regular title.

I want to try this out with a few other people and see if I can capture the love for it.  If not, I guess it will hit the trade pile.

I ended up selling this after a few attempts to get it to the table.  I didn't even end up wanting to play it solo, so I sold it to make space for other games.

OMG, if you thought LeHavre was bad, don't go anywhere near this. Agricola MKII it isn't ...

Feels like Jambo with all the fun sucked out ... take a nice quick intense 2 player game and add on a bunch of extra mechanics and rules, resulting in a game I'll be happy never to play again.

Apart from the dull but mind melting multiplayer solo type efficiency puzzle there is NOTHING you do in other player's turns, but you can't really plan in the downtime as there is enough interaction to screw up your plans. Intended to trade for that leek, sorry, someone else has used their trader and taken it - back to the drawing board of planning your turn again, ARGHH.

With fast game play I could play this sort of game - never going to be a favourite though, too mechanical, too 'solo' - but the downtime kills this one dead for me. I'll stick with Agricola.

I can see where this was an early step along Uwe's path to Agricola and Le Havre.  There's some good ideas in here that the other two games do better.  Also the way the game handles casual customers drive me nuts.

*5/4/11* - In an effort to get more of the games sitting on our shelf played, my wife and I have been going through our collection looking for suitable 2p games.  The latest game on the table has been At the Gates of Loyang.

After a few 2p sessions I have to say AtGoL really shines with two.  Once the participants are comfortable with the rules the level of interaction goes up dramatically.  Instead of being so tightly focused on your own farm, you now pay attention to what your competition is doing.  That broadened awareness becomes a much bigger factor in what cards you take/play and actions you choose.

When we first purchased the game I rated AtGoL as the weakest of Uwe's "Harvest Trilogy" titles.  I think that had to do more with the wonky gameplay that 4p offers or the excessive downtime of 3p and 4p sessions.  With 2p the game displays its strength and offers a good combination of challenge/interactivity with the right length of playtime.

Have now played almost a dozen solo games, a 3-player and a 4-player.  So far, none of the games have seemed to have too much downtime, even though the 3- and 4- were teaching new players.  It's less heavy than Agricola and probably won't have as much replayability but I think it will play faster and have more replayability than Le Havre.  A lighter Agricola with limited interaction/screw-you that seems to always end very tight.

I really like the bits and art and production quality of this game... but the game itself is a tad lacking. Unlike Le Havre or Agricola, which have a distinct feeling of progression as the boards open up to more possibilities, Loyang is pretty much doing rhe same thing over and over and over again. THis isn't always the worst thing, but the length of the game makes it an issue for me.

Cada jugador es un comerciante que tiene que conseguir dinero para escalar en el track de puntos de victoria. Ese track llega hasta 20. En cada turno, puedes pagar 1 para escalar un puesto y después pagas según lo que te diga el track.
Cada turno tiene tres fases. Cosechar, repartir cartas y realizar acciones. En la cosecha consigues vegetales, con las cartas puedes conseguir ayudantes (personajes que te dan ciertas ventajas), clientes habituales, clientes eventuales o mercados. El juego consiste en ir meneando tus mercancías de la forma más óptima para conseguir dinero.
Es un juego de gestión de recursos en el sentido literal de la palabra. Bastante rompecocos. Se echa de menos un poco más de interacción con los otros jugadores. La unica pega que le veo es que es muy dificil contrarrestar una ventaja inicial (opino con sólo una partida jugada).
Recomendable sólo para jugones.

Another fun game by Uwe Rosenberg! This one is far lighter and less complex than Agricola and Le Havre, but there is still the same tense feeling as you wonder whether or not your plan is going to work or leave you penniless and in last place. The way turns are handled in a 4 player game takes some getting used to, and in the card distribution phase sometimes it's hard to remember who 3rd and 4th player were. If anyone in your group is prone to AP the length of the game will increase exponentially, otherwise it moves fairly quickly and is simple to pick up and go! The little vegimeeples are awesome too!

Another great Rosenberg game, although not at the heights of Agricola or Le Havre. As the game is different enough from those two I would have preferred almost a further break from the mold: the salesman aspect could have leant itself to having more direct player interactions, for example. Still a good mix of brain-burning and just plain fun board gaming; Rosenberg is likely my favorite designer.

A contract-filling game with a unique, original and innovative action drafting system. After a couple of plays, the randomness of the cards can be quite game-breaking. Will need further plays to reassess.

One of the main criticisms will definitely be "multi-player" solitaire, which this is. 95% of the time, the 4 players can play simultaneously. There will be lots of down time as you wait for AP players to optimize their moves.

I did not expect to like this game since I really don't care for Agricola and I disllike Le Havre but somehow AtGoL feels a bit different.

I only played online on Yucata, where I like it, but I have doubts whether I would actually enjoy to play the cardboard version. There is very little interaction, and a lot to think about, so I guess there would be a lot of downtime. 

It's basically multiplayer solitaire, an optimization puzzle, with the notable exception of the action cards. This can lead to an unpleasant situation, where all the work spent on optimizing your trades can be ruined by a timely played action card of an opponent. In other words: I prefer games that only have indirect interaction, or games that are all the way confrontational. This one is in a weird spot in between.

The game is also very unforgiving. If you screw up a turn, you'll probably be behind for the rest of the game.

After three plays I've decided to give it a rating.  

A solid game, yet it seems to suffer from a lack of replayability.  It seems to me that there is very little variability from game to game due to the way the scoring track is laid out and the way that the small number of cards allows.  Maybe I'm just spoiled because of the variability of Agricola, but this game just doesn't capture my interest.

Game seems very loose to me and the decisions aren't that interesting. The 2 pack rule seemed pasted on - the turn order mechanic with a turn partner seems strange. The drafting phase did not work for. Everything seems very disjointed and I did not feel like I was farming at all, like in Agricola. WAY TOO LONG FOR WHAT IT IS.

Another wonderful farming game. Who'd have thought? Though the timing of harvests and future planning of turns can be very challenging, this feels much lighter and simpler than Agricola or Ora et Labora. I think it's partly because there is a push-your-luck/risk element absent from Rosenberg's other games: you might plant a vegetable knowing that you'll have an excess of it in a couple of turns, in the hopes that another customer will come along who wants it. The result is a game that is a little more unpredictable, and thus a little less strategic, than, say, Agricola. This might be frustrating to some people, but I think it's a nice change.

Not as good as Agricola, but still really good. Each player is building up an economic engine by trading vegetables. The card distribution phase is quite interactive; the action phase is not (though the Con Man can still strike fear in your heart). Still, there's a wonderful race element as you try to keep track of how much your opponent has and keep up.

Faults? Yes. A little long (does it have to be 9 rounds?); a little fiddly; brain-burning and tough to reason through. And the number of tiny little rules you have to memorize! Yikes. But the game flows pretty smoothly after a few rounds, and I will definitely try this again.

UPDATE: 8 -> 9. This game is awesome. I find it more calculable than Agricola, but just as stressful.

My initial play didn't strike me much, but it's grown on me. An important caveat though: my 8 rating is strictly for the 2-player game. I really think it degrades with each additional player: 3 players takes too long, and 4 takes too long *and* is too chaotic.

An interesting note on this game is that unlike the highly tactical Agricola or Le Havre, Gates of Loyang is as much risk management as it is planning or evaluation. On any given turn you don't have a ton of information, so you need to manage your fields and your cardflow in a way to keep your balance current revenues again keeping your options open, and know when to turn down a contract you can do because it'll constrain you too much for the future. It's clever, and the chance in the game is fun. But, it does mean that with 3 or 4 players, the added length is a real problem.

Pretty much everything here was done better in Agricola. The idea of planting crops and harvesting them is still a good one, but the mechanisms around it aren't as entertaining or interactive.

Hrmm, I'm just not sure how I feel about this one, but I'm leaning toward the thought that I probably won't play this one a whole lot.  Half way through the game, I was really enjoying things.  However, as things progressed the game just seemed to go on and on and on with no sense of progression towards anything.  Every turn just felt like more of the same, and the game just plain overstayed its welcome.

The scoring system used here also seems strangely applied, and makes it a heck of a time for anyone to ever come up with a come from behind victory.  Seems like the leader is just going to stay there save a couple of really lucky card drafts for the trailing players and some terrible ones for the leader.

Also, while it has no bearing on my rating, I feel like this game is a complete rip-off for what you get.  I was sorely disappointed when I opened the $70 box to discover a cavern full of air, with a deck of cards and some vegimeeples thrown in.  Compare this to a Fantasy Flight giant box games like Descent which comes with junkloads of bits for under $70, and it just doesn't make sense.  After seeing what comes with the game, I would have expected Loyang to be published as an Alea mid-sized box with a $40ish price tag.  Buyer beware.

Updated 7/17/10.

This is now my wife's second-favorite game.  That may be a little misleading actually.  I'm not sure she enjoys it as much as some other games, but she keeps requesting, it in part because she rarely wins.  We've only ever played 2-player, and given that the length of the game outpaces its interest to me, I doubt that we'd attempt a 4-player game more than once.  

Overall, At the Gates of Loyang is clearly the lightest and probably the weakest of Uwe Rosenberg’s Harvest Trilogy.  For the uninitiated, Loyang is a card-based board game about farming in ancient China. The core of the game is strategically planting crops for future harvests and collecting cards that allow you to exchange crops or sell crops for cash. As you can tell from that description, Loyang at times seems to share a closer bond with one of Rosenberg’s earlier games, Bohnanza, than it does with either Agricola or LeHavre. 

That said, Rosenberg has done an impressive job imbedding a risk/reward gamble in numerous facets of the game. For example, each crop has a value that is directly correlated to its scarcity, and the game employs an innovative victory point system that encourages players to purchase VP heavily each round at the risk of not having enough money to optimize future turns. The result is that numerous decisions each turn feel meaningful, which is rare in a card-based game with such a significant luck factor. 

The game is far from perfect, however. First, the resource-conversion bit is already AP-inducing enough that the second layer of short- and long-term balancing may just be too much for some people. (I can think of a few people already who I would never introduce this game to). Second, unlike my other favorite “get things to get things to build things or buy things” resource management games, Loyang provides only the slightest window for players to impact the decisions of those around them. In fact, the game that Loyang most reminds me of – Homesteaders – practically feels like a wargame in comparison, what with its confrontational “auction” mechanic and limited building types. If ever there was such a thing in our hobby as multi-player Solitaire, At the Gates of Loyang is it (Dominion is a close second and a apropos comparison). 

The result is a good game that’s lighthearted (if not light), and fun, but that feels like it occupies well-trod ground. I liked it enough to purchase it, and it serves us well as a whimsical optimization game for weeknights (specifically Fridays) with my wife (the bits are very attractive, which, alone, entices my wife to pull it off the shelf more often than it deserves).

Overall, it's a solid game that I can appreciate, but which I'll never be gaga over.  This type of simplistic resource optimization mechanic is not my cup of tea, but it comes in a pleasant and attractive package that makes for a fine 90-minute exercise.

Very good Euro that is at its best with 2 in my opinion. The game has lovely veggie meeples and the trademark artwork of Rosenberg games. The different customers and helpers give the game a lot of replaybility, which I always love, and it has a really interesting scoring track mechanism. Requires a little bit of planning to make sure you have your resources for regular customers but otherwise it is a good choice for an introduction to Rosenberg's farming games.

The final game in Uwe Rosenberg's "Harvest Trilogy", At the Gates of Loyang captures the essence of commerce very well and the various player actions are intuitive and easy to grasp.  This works well as a two-player game (and many feel it only works with two players).  However, there is a lot of accounting and number-crunching involved, so it can feel a bit dry at times.  My least favourite of the "Harvest Trilogy" at the moment, but still a very good game.

A good game from the creator of my favorite game, Agricola. Loyang isn't as good as that one or Le Havre, but it's nonetheless a good game which I enjoy. 

There is much more luck involved compared to his two major games; you can sow some pumpkins, but when the customer you draw wants turnips, you need to rethink what to do. There is a lot of card drawing, and especially the two-pack action is pretty random in my opinion as you might buy it for 2-3 gold and get nothing you want. Still, it's a decent game about serving your customers and earn the most money which you use to buy victory points.

The game can drag a little too much with 3 players as it's mostly a multiplayer solitaire game with little interaction, and you kind of need to wait for the first player to make his actions as he can have an impact on what you can do if he decides to use a helper. So I like it best with 2, but won't turn down a game with 3.

My recommended number of players: 2, 3

RATING: 6
The essence of this game is quite good. But it is multiplayer solitaire "in extremo". Besides, the victory point mechanism is bad - more often than not, you are just one coin short for a second step on one turn, thus losing the game. And in the end, those single coins seem to decide the whole game, since the game is that well balanced that you get the feeling it doesn't really matter what you do en detail - in the end, all players are usually just one step on the point track from another.

Much better after more plays. I've been playing this a lot online as a 2 player game and I really like it. The card combinations are really where this game shines, along with the great decisions to be made. It takes some plays to get familiar with the flow of play because there is a good amount of planning in this game. There is also a really cool drafting mechanic. I can see this seeing lots of play.

This is a good game for 2 players, but I can't imagine playing with more.  There would be too much info to consider in the parts where you do interact, and too much downtime when you don't.  It's a nice, solid design for 2.  The comments about it being an optimization puzzle are fairly accurate.  When you're turn comes around, you figure out how to optimize and then just go through the steps.  I'll probably play it for a little while and then trade it.

UPDATE:  Not fun enough.  Traded.

The pieces are very nice and the game is extremely tight. It is quite fun setting up your veggie to customer engine but the game can get to be on the longer side if playing with slower players.

Rated 5 after one play. So, what did I like? I dug the theme, which really reinfores the mechanics. Planting, harvesting, and selling veggies all makes sense. 

What didn't I like? Holy smokes is this a solitaire game... probably one of the most isolating games I've played. And, as each person's private farm ramps up, turns become very slow. if these things are not a drawback for a gamer, there's plenty to like here. But for me, I'm really learning that a steady flow and a rhythm to a good turn order impact my enjoyment of a game. This game and I just don't click. 

Maybe additional plays would convince me otherwise, but that will require some modest arm twisting.

RATING: 4
Very disappointed in this one as I thought I would enjoy the puzzle of the solo game, but it just felt way too constrained to me to be fun. Lots of work to get a little money every step of the way and the ever increasing round length just made it that much harder for me to think through the best way each turn. This game is also incredibly fiddly with all the different veggiemeeples being moved around between various cards. It just felt like work to me as opposed to a fun experience and having played Glass Road that game definitely feels like a better evolution that includes more interaction and much less fiddliness with the resource wheels. I'd always want to play Glass Road instead of this.

Aunque en la caja ponga que se puede jugar a cuatro en realidad se juega por parejas de dos y se hace mucho mas pesada la espera entre turno y turno con cuatro jugadores pues la interacción es bastante baja. Al principio no me llamaba nada el tema ahora me encanta tanto la caja como todos sus componentes además con la traducción y maquetación de las reglas y las cartas de los helpers en español el juego es ya totalmente independiente del idioma. En fin es un juego con mecánicas similares al Agrícola y a Le Havre pero que se juega en 60 minutos, es un brain-burning que cada turno te hará exprimir tu cerebro para optimizar tu cosecha y la mejor forma de venderla. Altamente recomendable incluso para jugarlo en solitario.

The best of Rosenberg's Harvest games, in my opinion. If only for the fantastic integration of a single player mode by default. My one thing that could have seen improvement: the reuse of wheat meeples from the Agricola crops - could have easily been replaced with something more associated with the theme (such as water chestnuts). But other than that, a truly excellent resource management game.

Cube pusher to the max.  Or should I say vegetable pusher.  I enjoy, but I'm concerned about down time between players.  Seems a step backward from the quick actions of Agricola and LeHavre.  I can see why two players is the magic number, less down time.  Lightest of the Rosenberg three.  I'm thinking this game is a perfect two player game, but I'm not sure if it is worth investing the time with four....

From my comments on this list http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/48198/item/1093145?commentid=1304081#comment1304081


If you think of Agricola, Le Havre, and AtGoL as a (vegetable) series, then I would say this is a continuation more of the Le Havre route, but it's a bit more straightforward and less option laden.

However I do find it hard to get really enthused about pushing different coloured vegetables around. Sure for Agricola this was OK because the individual character attributes (occupations and minor improvements) you get so define where you're heading, and make everything more thematic. AtGoL does have helper cards which are kind of it's equivalent - but these are more one shot wonders and don't continue through the whole game making it resonate in the same way.

It does feel a slow, mathy, push things around, be an accountant kind of game and for me has so far given the impression that once more it's just not going to be fun long term. Unlike with Le Havre though it hasn't completely put me off on the first game play, but I'm not especially enthused so far.

Now with a four player game as well.

I wouldn't want to go near this game if anyone with AP was in the group.
It just isn't exciting. There's nothing that enthuses anywhere in this game. The gameplay works fine (although I have nagging suspicions that who gets the best cards, eg early fields in the auction and especially the two-packs is particularly significant), There isn't really a great deal of interaction, and the helpers that do interact feel forced to make there be interaction. The gameplay itself isn't particularly fun (manipulate vegetables to fulfil orders). The weird partnership action with 4 players is needed to ensure the game doesn't bog down but is really awkward and limits the interaction helpers even more.

A very engaging game.  It begins rough as cash dries up quickly but setting yourself up for the end game with multiple harvests is where this becomes rewarding.  It seems this will surpass Agricola, especially in the 2-player version, with just a couple more plays.

I definitely prefer the drafting and recycling of cards over Agricola.

I don't really like the way the scoring works in this one. It ends up feeling like there is little catch-up and little change in the leaders. Bottom line, I kind of loathe playing this one. I've tried it 2p, 3p, 4p. Frankly, I've played it more than most games I dislike this much.

I think if the designer didn't have a couple notable successes this one wouldn't even have warranted much exposure. But this one fails to live up to the expectations his earlier hits have created. You can't win them all.

RATING: 4
In one regard, Loyang is the game that I wanted Agricola to be: you are farming, the harvest is central. This game, apparently, predates Agricola though, and draws more inspiration from Antiquity. As has been standard for Rosenberg in recent years, it's a rather complex little beast to explain, though it's actually very simple in play, in my opinion, too simple.

The real quick and dirty is that players have vegetable gardens that have between 3-9 spaces on them. They buy or trade for seeds that they plant and they harvest one item from each field at the start of each round. They then go through a phase where cards are dealt out from a deck of customers, traders, helpers. Beginning with a hand of 4, cards are discarded into the centre of the table, one by one. Once a player sees something that they want in the pile, they pick up that card, choose one other card from their hand, and throw the rest into the pile for the other people to choose from. After this, they go into their main turn where they can trade vegetables at market stalls and fill the needs of customers who can be regular or casual. Casuals pay more, but are one shots. Regulars offer consistent income that is easy to regularize with carefully planted fields but will commit drive-bys on your shop if you don't supply them every year, costing you $2 in repair bills. All of the money that is generated is used to buy VPs, where the first VP for the round always costs 1, and the extra ones always cost whatever the number is that you're landing on.

I like efficiency puzzles like this, and can take some joy in picking up huge piles of wooden pumpkin bits, but the thing that concerns me is that there is very little interaction between the players aside from a few of the helper cards, and that you see the entire deck of cards multiple times in each game. It's great fun to be picking up great piles of pumpkins, turnips, and ghostface killah (don't ask) and to turn them into the customers for cash, but it's not particularly variable and there's not a lot you can do to interact with the other players aside from the card-play phase. The problem there is that the very things that you would want to keep from them, namely customers that demand vegetables they can grow, are the very things that you can't afford to take because having unusable customers is not only a time sink but directly damaging to your score because of the penalties for not filling regular's orders, and for having too many casual customers queued up.

I also feel that the game is simply too long for what it offers. The narrative arc of rags to riches is there, and it's fulfilling to be pulling in big harvests at the end of the game and swapping veggies like a mad fool, but that back half really is, at a baseline, a lot like the front half, you're doing the same thing, just more of it, and not like Le Havre where there is a lot of chaining involved, it really is just "these two veggies go to this regular" in the front part of the game and "these two veggies go to this regular, those 2 to that regular, and those 3 to the casual" in the back half.

Revisiting this with 4 at the table basically reiterated the above points for me. The game was a bit lower on the downtime scale, which was good, but it wasn't as fresh either, so it seemed to be a rough wash for me. I never feel particularly creative when playing this game, as most of the decisions seem to be dictated by the cards that are dealt or made available to you. Making sure that you have enough veggies available throughout the game seems to be goal #1, and then getting the right customers to go with that are key #2. There is very little interaction in the game, which I don't care for, and the 2/4 player games have even less than the 3 in the use of helper cards, which doesn't improve it. I know the cardplay is supposed to offer interaction, but I don't feel like I'm having to make tough decisions in that phase all that often. What you're going to drop is usually obvious, as is what you're willing to pick cards up for. If you have a helper card that depends on poaching from someone else then you're going to want to wait for them to drop (provided you're in a spot in the order where you can force that) but for the most part there aren't any significant new decisions added to this phase for me regardless of the count.

I rated this a tentative 7 after the first play and it has settled, initially to a 6 and now to an honest 4. I expect a lot more out of games that are in this 1.5-2 hour window. If this game was about half as long I would definitely rate it higher, but as it is, it is way too limited for the amount of time that it takes up, and I don't see this ever clocking in at under 1hr20 except with 2 perhaps, and with 2 there are so many better options. Feels very repetitive to me.

Aside: don't ask me why, but for some reason we were on the gangster rap theme when playing this game. The white vegetable was ghostface killah, the two-pack was the Tupac, and the regular customers were committing drive-bys in retribution for not being served. This likely added .5 to my rating.

Tegnap egy 3fős partit játszottunk. Érdekes játék, az a fajta amivel szívesen játszanék még. Mindez annak ellenére, hogy utolsó lettem és hogy nagy benne a szerencsefaktor. Ráadásul csak 9 kör van, a közös fázis után az egyéni fázisok nagyon hosszúra nyúlnak. A játékosok ritkán szólnak bele egymás dolgába (kiv. amikor két-két lapot választunk), de olyankor nagyon keményen, ami óriásit változtathat az addigi stratégián, ez zavaró.

Kevés lehetőségből minél többet kell kihozni, ráadásul nehezen indul be az áru- és pénztermő gépezet.

Once you make it through the somewhat opaque instructions for the distribution phase, this turns out to be a great little game- and one that seems to intrinsically favor nailbiter outcomes.  In my first game, I managed to barely edge out my sister despite a massive profit-taking run on her part in the last turn netting over 20 cash.  A bit solitaire-ish, but many of the helper cards add a touch of relatively nonaggressive interaction.  Moved pretty quickly as a 2p, too, though there is a bit of the old sit 'n watch from time to time.

Loyang was briefly on my Spiel-list when the game came out in 2009, but the hideous pricetag of €40 for a bag of veggiemeeples, two packs of cards, and some very minor cardboard work held me off almost instantly. In 2010 I could already see some suppliers dropping the price to a more acceptable €25. I eventually got an excellent (and hardly used) copy for €15 some time later. That price is probably too low again, but not by much.

It is a favourite of my partner, who really digs and loves the veggies, and so over time I clocked up a nice amount of games with our copy. I confess myself surprised at how the game has grown on me—it is an unashamed growth engine which I tend not to like much—and how insidious its mechanisms really are. The game at first appears to be nothing special really, and in fact quite often Uwe Rosenberg fans express serious disdain for Loyang when comparing it to Agricola and Le Havre, the two other titles of the so-called Harvest Trilogy. Loyang is admittedly the least involved of that trio, so if you are looking for that 'epic arc' or 'multitude of choices' you won't find them here, true. But that's not to say Loyang is without merits... and there is quite a simple test to find out if people know these: ask them [i]What is your highest score you've obtained to date?[/i]

It may sound anodyne to reduce a game to comparing high scores, but that misses the point. You see, Loyang is a growth engine [i]without brakes[/i]. There is no mechanism in the game which slows a player down in a periodic fashion. Like happens in, say, Agricola or Le Havre. Loyang encourages you to push things as hard and as far as they will go. It is not uncommon for beginning players to end up with a score of 15 or 16 VP plus some money left over, and wondering what the hubbub is about. But then you try for 17 VP, 18, all the way out to what at that point becomes a mind-boggling 21 VP. When playing for those stakes the slightest disturbance, the slightest error, the slightest miscalculation will wipe off many cash from your ledger and reduce your VP total. Suddenly what appear to be innocent and boring helper cards become laser-guided VP-seeking missiles of chaos and doom. That stupid gamey two-pack becomes a gamble which may or may not pay off magnificently. You will find ways to abuse even the simplest of helpers. Loans, so attractive at first, become more and more expensive the higher your VP total climbs, so the game expects you to do better more than averagely once you decide to accept the offer of 'free' cash. The whole struggle on a knife's edge only appears once you [i]really[/i] push the game. And the first inkling that the game has been pushed, is the highest score obtained to date. 

I will readily admit that the game has its moods and quirks: it can be argued that in such a difficult environment randomness really ought not to have a place. Yet it does, in various ways. So you cannot expect to reach your high score in every game. At the same time it should come as a comfort that you will not ever strike it so lucky that you can expect to boost your scores with an entire VP or so. The cards appear to deliver debilitating pinpricks rather than massive punches to the face. But given enough pinpricks, you'll still suffer. Also, despite what it says on the box this is a 2 player game exclusively. You can play with more people as the material is there in the box, but I fail to see the point. You need surgical precision to take out opponent's cards, and can do without the complication of a 3rd and 4th player.

All in all, an unjustly shunned game by Uwe Rosenberg. It may be simple in concept, but the devil is truly in the details with this one. I'm glad that it eventually made it back to print in 2016, despite remaining hellishly expensive as when it first came out.

My top score is 18+4, by the way. Not as good as can be (as I said I'm not good with growth engines) but still sufficiently respectable to speak with a modicum of experience on what makes this game 'tick'. And to wonder how the [i]hell[/i] people have managed to break the 20 VP barrier.

RATING: 7
John says that if I love Antiquity I will love Loyang... but I don't.  There just isn't enough variety here to make this a long term winner.  Pick some cards, hope the combos work and plant some crops.  Then rinse and repeat.

The player interaction is flimsy at best.  You should pay attention to what others are doing, but only to keep optimizing your own position.  The fact that you can actually effect other players negatively is actually a downer in this game as it comes almost unexpectedly as there are very few cases where that is the best move. So when it does happen it seems a bit malicious.

But either way there is some challenge here.  Try to figure out the best way to feed people.  How to change goods into other goods.  How much to pay for points.  Yeah it feels done, but it is a decent remix.

But if you can, play someone else's copy.

This is a decent game for 2 players, though it has some dangerous potential for analysis paralysis. Feels kind of like Agricola combined with Power Grid at times.

RATING: 8.75
What Rosenberg has created here is a game that builds on his familiar theme of agriculture, but is much simpler to learn.  Players plant vegetables, harvest them, and then sell them in order to get more.  Regular customers are demanding, while casual customers give only a one-time payoff.  Various helper cards make things easier, and market stalls allow you to swap vegetables to get what you need.

For such a simple game, the mental gymnastics required are substantial.  This is a great cerebral game for anyone that likes a good puzzle, as you try to figure out how to get the most out of your meager fields.  Is it worth it to buy a leek to plant it? Or are you better off trading for cabbage?

Loyang is one of those games that just clicks with me and it's hard to describe why I'm so fond of it.  It just WORKS.  I've fallen very hard for it.

RATING: 4
on first play, an unimpressive combination of random card play, followed by brain burning number crunching during the actions phase.

the fact it took well over 3 hours for a 4 player game may well be a major factor in this low rating, and I could probably just about be persuaded to give this another go as a 3 player game with the right group.

-Thinking through the puzzle of how to maximize each turn.
-Building a money-making system is very satisfying.
-The length of the game is perfect.

Don't Like:

-Downtime.  Watching somebody else run their side of the game isn't thrilling when you're dying to put your own strategies into action.
-Some unexciting cards come up too often.
-The card draft feels really lopsided sometimes.
-The rulebook left me with several questions, and it's not easy to find a specific rule when you want to verify it.

I think I'd really love Loyang [i]if[/i] everyone could take their individual turns at the same time (which would speed the game up considerably). Unfortunately, too many of the helpers change (or are reliant on) other players' board positions for that to be straightforward. Perhaps if there were a "use helpers with lanterns" phase before / after / before-and-after the turns?

RATING: 8.7
4th game in Uwes 'trilogy'. I consider this to be Uwe's sleeper. The wife and I have played it so many times that this is the first game that I 1) have had to get card protectors for and 2) have considered buying a new game-JUST for a 'card replacement'. Simple yet really fun. A good amount of strategizing and also a good bit of luck-will my next field be a 3,4,5, or 6? The larger the field the fewer crop types you can plant there AND the lower the worth of the crops. The 'helpers' add lots of flavor and the initial play to the 'court' (or is that the 'El Grande' terminology?) is fraught with stress....because you have to take ONE from the court and ONE from your hand-but in order to have a good one in the court-you have to lay it there....meaning that in the intervening turn, opponents are likely to take it....wait too long and you may get stuck with good ones in your hand that you cannot use. EXTREMELY interesting/novel scoring mechanism too-you buy points. The first one is always just $1, but for each higher point you have to pay THAT point value (so for example if you are on 15, going to 16 is just $1 but going to 17 is $1 + $17)....as with the bulk (all?) of Uwes games-you can take a loan. Loans in this game are unlimited, can be taken at any time, used for anything-and sometimes its even smart to do so! But they can NEVER be repaid!! You just lost 1 point at the end of the game for each loan (HINT: Take a look at the # of loans your opponent has).....

Components: Awesome wooden vegetables. Unique artwork for each character card. Clear rules.

Experience: Tight resource-/money-management game. Tense choices between returning customers and casual customers. The action deck can be capricious (it's a big advantage to secure the only market in the first round). The odd scoring mechanism helps keep the cashflow tight.

The only of Uwe's "Harvest Trilogy" that I would call "okay," rather than "good" (Agricola) or "great" (Le Havre).  Astute geeks will notice that I have Loyang rated higher than Agricola, because while I think Agricola is a better design, Loyang is just more enjoyable in my experience.  It does what it sets out to do, I think, and that's enough for me.  Won't hit my table all the time, but when it does, a good time is had.

Not overly complex. Is pretty fun. If you like the agricultural aspect of Agricola. Then you'll really dig Loyang. You're buying a selling vegetables and also selecting cards that will allow you to fulfill objectives along the way. I'd like to play this game much more than I do, but other games get selected over this one. I need to push it more.

Very much more of a puzzle game than Agricola or Le Havre. Another fine effort by Rosenberg. However, I don't find it quite as fun as those games, primarily because the downtime of one person doing all their actions at once (by mid-to-late game you're taking 6+ actions a turn) slows down. In a three-player game, you wind up sitting there and watching two others do this and it drags a bit.

[12/2/13 update] downgraded to 6 because the game's mechanisms don't particularly excite me, and once you get behind it feels impossible to catch back up

Super Addictive Solitaire Game!

In the same general family as Le Havre, but with different chaos conditions. You still have to plan ahead and can get screwed by other players' choices, but the thing that I like most is that every move to increase your options comes with a cost. Also, you can generally do what you want to do in this game, assuming you plan correctly, but no "I lose a critical cycle because someone else is on the building I have to use" element from Le Havre. Downtime with three players can be a bit of an issue if they haven't planned in advance.

Games are supposed to be enjoyable.  This game is not.  This game would be panned by board game critics (oh wait, there aren't any . . .) if it weren't for the name "UWE" on the box.  Specifically:

(1) It's the epitome of multi-player solitaire.  Yea there are some helpers that interact with other players, but they mostly suck and don't get used often.  In other words, you never really plan with them in mind.
(2) It's too long. I don't think this game has ever taken less than 2 hours, even with 2 players.  
(3) Each turn involves a lot of mental math, and thus AP. And guess what? Players usually can't do actions simultaneously, meaning that you're going to wait while your opponent (or you) tries to squeeze out 1 more cent on their turn.
(4) Games are always close, which means squeezing that last cent out of your vegetables might actually be important, thereby justifying the AP. It also means that fortunate draws can cause a win amongst experienced players.  

So it's a long, AP-inducing, multiplayer solitaire game. And mind-numbingly boring. If you want to Rosenberg it up, play Agricola instead. Or Ora et Labora. Heck I'd even recommend Le Havre over this.  

Bottom line: It's too similar to much better games to be worth your time.

If only real vegetable farming were this easy! Seems quite a bit more strategic with the Regular Customers.  Downside is the AP-ness of trying to be super-efficient (and becoming familiar with the various cards).  I actually enjoy this game quite a bit and would like to play it more often.  These Rosenberg games have wonderful components and artwork to compliment the great gameplay. Unlike Agricola and Le Havre, there is no mandatory feeding of workers/family. Just plant and harvest vegetables to sell to customers and use the proceeds to buy VPs. Add in some market stalls so you can more easily manipulate what vegetables you have and some Helper cards to change some of the rules and that's pretty much the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Picked this game up for a steal, without knowing anything about it. I was resistant to buy it for that reason, but am glad I was talked into it.

This game has great depth and complexity and will require careful and considered foresight. 

It's a game of economics: select customers to serve; buy vegetables; invest the vegetables in plowed fields; harvest vegetables; seek to fulfill customer orders.

It sounds simple, but really it is not. Veggies that return the most money only have a low yield from cropping. Not all veggies can be grown in all fields. Some customers want very difficult to fulfill orders. 

This game scales flawlessly, and works well as a solo game.

It gets a high rating because of its depth compared to its good length of play (circa 1hr or less with 2p) and its replayability.

I'm glad I took a chance on Loyang and I'm pleasantly surprised at how much I like it.  True, player interaction is low but the card draft is interesting and you can poach key ingredients and customers.  Nice mental exercise.  UPGRADE. Third play and the game really opened up.  Player interaction was high and the pressure to keep the pace was intense.  UPGRADE.  Just plain great.  The interaction with your opponent is subtle but so important.

After playing this a few times as a two player game over at Yucata.de, I have to admit that Loyang really grew on me. It's a nice puzzle-style game with room for some clever play and the more I played it, the more interactive it did get. Two thumbs up for a nice trading and card drafting game.

A very nice game that perhaps runs a bit long.  I like the delicious decision of planting for long term gains versus fulfilling orders for earlier money.  The level of screwage is perhaps a little high for my tastes (especially the con man card), and there are so many plays that could be made because of infinite number of actions that could theoretically be taken that it lends itself to AP.  Still, fairly fun and would happily play again.

By the end of the game, I've definitely had enough of cycling wooden vegetable tokens and need some time to rebuild an interest in playing.

RATING: 7
Gets an extra point for the drafting mechanics which I really enjoy.  But I see this maxing out at 8.  I like the card interactions and look forward to more plays.  The negative that I see is the scoring system.  It seems too tight.  Everyone is doing different things to make money and score points, but ultimately the winner will likely be tied with other players at game's end.  This isn't necessarily bad, but it can feel strange for some reason.

Dropping it down a point (8-->7).  I still like it, but there are some issues that I'm seeing. The main issue is that the end gets overly fiddly in terms of optimizing the use of your vegetables, 2-packs, and other cards. It's very difficult to track what the other players are doing.  Plus with a myriad of "take-backs" and "redo's" to optimize, it drags the game out a bit too much.  As a result I lose interest in following what another player does on his turn.  Thus it can lull you into the solitaire mindset, until that one moment when someone hoses you with a card.

Pre-ordered October 13, 2009. 

The third in Uwe Rosenberg’s Harvest Trilogy, At the Gates of Loyang has few similarities with the other games in the trilogy beyond having a harvest phase and the presence of excellent looking veggiemeeples. It is less interactive than either Agricola or Le Have; the decisions one makes in Loyang rarely have an impact on the other players, except during narrow slices of the game. It is also lighter than either of those games without being especially shorter. 

When boiled down to its essentials, Loyang is a slightly interactive efficiency puzzle. Because of this, the game loses very little when played solo. In fact, that might be my favorite form of the game, though the two player version of the game is fast enough and interesting enough to be worth playing. 

I have since traded this one away, but will probably reacquire it at some point due to my girlfriends enjoyment of the game. Boy, was she mad when I traded it.

An excellent farming simulation. The theme is great and I really enjoyed building my engine. This game can be very AP prone you have to watch out with whom you are playing with. Best as two or three player game.

Players are vegetable growers, planting and sowing crops, then trying to sell them for cash coins.  Coins are spent on prestige, which is how you win the game.  Fairly simple game, rules-wise, where players harvest a good from their planted fields, pick up a few cards via a slightly strange distribution mechanism, then take actions to process their vegetables.  At the end of each turn, cash is used to buy advances on the prestige track.  Fun game, let down by a rather poor set of rules along the lines of Agricola and Le Havre, but once you crack the code you're fine.  The game seems designed for very close finishes, usually decided by tie breakers.  Probably best as a solo or two player game.  Very expensive for essentially a box of air, a deck of cards and some wooden pieces.

I want to like this game, but have a big issue with the workers:  their effects are just too varied in power/impact to be fair.

Also, when you opponent gets 2 public fields in the first turn, they are going to win.  

In either case, I felt very screwed over by luck.

We initially played that you can replant your fields, and I think that made for a better game.  I'm willing to give this one a couple more plays, but definitely without the worker cards.

RATING: 6.75
The most (only?) elegant game in the "Harvest Trilogy". I think the designer was trying too hard to make it deeper than it is. The game outcome seems to be more heavily weighted towards early decisions - a flaw also shown in Le Havre, and to a lesser extent, Agricola. Uwe needs to simplify and make the accessible, middle-weight masterpiece the gaming world knows he is capable of.

Designer is the same guy (Uwe Rosenberg) who designed Agricola and Le Havre, but this one doesn't measure up to either of those.  It's not a bad game; just a bit dull.  The last 3-4 fields you draw come up so late in the game that you hardly get any use out of them.

The card-drafting mechanic is very cool, though.  You either have to make your pick and drop out of the draft or else you add a card to the draft pool in an attempt to tempt your opponent...

Hm. Tetszett elsőre, bár igen álmosan játszottam, így nem teljesen mérvadó. Jól tervezhető, vetés-aratás-kereskedés. Ugyanakkor szoros meccses, a végeredmény gyakorlatilag 1-1- pontokon múlt. Nyelvfüggő. Újra játszás esetén lehet, h érne többet is, elsőre ennyi.
update: volt újra játszás. nem ér többet, sőt még a 8-as is veszélyben. Azért sok szerencse maradt benne, és ugyanaz a bajom, mint a Kubával is, ha valamilyen irány felé indulsz el, simán lehet, h az utolsó 3 körben már a helyzeteden nem tudsz változtatni -ez volt az első játéknál is, de azt a fáradtságnak tudtam be.- Az újabb játéknál 3 körrel a vége előtt boritékolható volt a végeredmény, és az is lett.

[-]I have owned this forever, but it seems everyone is past playing it.  I need to get this one under my belt and I refuse to solo it.[/-]

After a bajillion years of having this on my shelf, I finally got this played, twice in the same day.

First off, there is something absolutely fun about building the best economic machine you can, so even losing isn't that bad.  With the draw of the cards, though, there's no guarantee that what you're building will work every game, which makes it a great euro for me.  No optimal path means lots of variety.

However, never play this game 4 players.  While the 'partner' rules are there to speed gameplay along, this game is absolutely best with 2 players.  We played with 3 as well and it takes away the partner thing, but having that extra player just made the game drag on a bit.  With a 2 player game, we managed to blast through the rounds and the scoring was extremely close.

As a final note, cash is EVERYTHING.

RATING: 7.5
It's like the Occupation and Sowing/Harvesting parts of Agricola expanded into their own game.  It reminds me a lot of 51st State, in that the goal for much of the game is to find ways to spend the resources you already have rather than to find the resources you need to spend.  I like the resource management part of the game, but the card drafting at the beginning is often quite frustrating, especially because a large portion of the deck is "Helper" cards that are only situationally useful.  Like 51st State, it's very necessary to draw as many cards as possible.  Also, the way turns are structured makes the game feel somewhat slow, as each player spends a good 10 minutes deliberating their turn during the drafting phase, and then takes a long turn of resource swapping and spending.

Loyang is an interesting game and I could see why it works best with 2.  I like how cards are added to a pool for people to pick from.  I also like how cards that are used get cycled back into the deck.  The whole individual player market and resource management of this market and your fields is also pretty cool.  I got the slight feeling of a more-complex/involved version of Jambo.  Especially when you consider the interactive helpers.  While I enjoyed my first game of this (due to novelty and interesting mechanisms) I worry that the tight scoring would bother me over a number of plays.  I'd like to explore it more and have it as my two-player medium-length game of choice (over Burgundy due to having played Burgundy so many times), but not enough to actually purchase it.  The card size is also really weird for this game and hard to sleeve. At the moment, I like this more than Agricola and Le Havre, but not as much as Caverna or O&L.

Revolves around a dull scoring mechanic... unless you are a terrible player, everyone has 1 gold to buy the 1 victory point a turn over the 9 turns, so the whole game boils down to who can buy the 2nd or 3rd point each turn... in the end it is a lot of work to win/lose a game by a point or two.

At the Gates of Loyang is the purest refinement of Rosenberg's familiar reap-and-sow mechanic. The key aspect of the game is establishing an oiled supply chain to support your growing customer base. Properly planting these fields, and securing appropriate customers provides the game's challenge, but he most interesting facets of Loyang lie outside of this core mechanic. The recurring action card draft, though unique, deserved more focus. Additionally, the balancing of regular and casual customers introduces an element of prioritization, but from a point generating perspective often results in a zero-sum benefit.  Loyang has a decent narrative arc, but varies little from game to game. Players first build up their infrastructure, maintain steady production, and finally cash everything out for points. While reap-and-sow is an enjoyable mechanic, Loyang is a bit too long, and could have benefited from a condensed set of rounds.

RATING: 3
It's easy to see this is the game that Agricola would have been if Caylus didn't come along. It's no surprise this game was supposedly designed before Agricola but released after words - it's just not nearly as good as Agricola for a lot of reasons. First, the interaction is fiddly and uninspiring. Loyang's cards lack the balance of cards Agricola - there's just some that do things that are rather unbalanced with no downside or prerequisites. Above all, Loyang is a lot longer with a lower payout. Simply put, this game was obsolete the day it was released.  I'm suspicious that if the Agricola phenomenon never happened, this game would have never have been released.

I initially rated this game quite cautiously because I was told it could get quite same-y. After 35+ plays (including solo and 2 player) I have not found that to be the case. Granted I don't play many games solo but...best solo mechanism EVER! I don't really see this game ever leaving my collection, and cannot see any way in which it could be improved. Rating raised to 10.

This is the first Uwe Rosenberg I've played/owned. Best thing ever - vegimeeples! Other than that, the game plays really smoothly as both a solo and 2 player effort. Love the way the cards are laid out in the solo game. Tried an open market like that in the 2 player game a few times but it induced an unbelieveable amount of AP in my opponent :) Scores are slightly less than in the normal game because of having to pay for items in the market, but I like the element it adds of having to make sure you don't hand your opponent too many easy opportunities. My best score so far is 18.18 and I hope to continue improving. There is that element of luck - sometimes all you have is helpers, sometimes you have a handful of regular customers and not enough veggies - but I love the puzzle of figuring out what to do in those circumstances with the resources at your disposal.

Personally, I really enjoy this game. I was surprised to see a relatively low rating for this game compared to some of Uwe's other notable titles, but this game is great. It's essentially multiplayer solitaire that can get a little cutthroat only if a player really goes out of his or her way to do so by stealing or using another player's cards but most of the time they will have access to everything they need. It's fascinating how Uwe was able to balance a game so incredibly well that an average game will be 16-17 points, an extremely well played game will be 18 points, a borderline perfect game will be 19 points, and 20 points seems nearly impossible. It's a very relaxing puzzle that requires brilliance. Very nice to play after a long day. Highly replayable.

This game is becoming something of a solitaire mainstay for me. A game takes about 70-80 minutes, including set up and take down, so is perfect for an afternoon or early evening quick game. Part of the attraction is the degree to which it requires, for me at least, maximum concentration.

The underappreciated game of the harvest trilogy.  Loyang holds its own with the other games in this trilogy.  A very pleasant game without the pain and hardwork of Agricola and Le Havre--yet I would still not call it light.  Game play is the most open and unrestricted of the harvest trilogy games, as the pressure to feed is not there, nor is the tension between long term goals and short term survival present.  You simply harvest and then maximize your profit. Fun theme too.

Rating history: 7,6

7- APR 2010: Very Euro (especially for Uwe considering his recent designs) but a lot of unique mechanisms and arrangement in the player space. Still, point salad, right?

6- JUN 2014: Since I've been on quite the Uwe Rosenberg kick lately, I wanted to give this one another go - but my feelings from last session (see above comment) from four year ago are simply redoubled. Very euro, very point salad, but - worse - very parallel play. And the mechanical stunts you can pull kill the theme for me completely (emptying out a small market by swapping 1:1:1:1 makes no sense, nor does bringing in occupations then releasing them with no use OR penalty!) The prettiness of the visuals and the farming theme are seductive, and make me want to give this a 7, but if I'm being honest about GAME enjoyment, this is a 6. (Which begs an interesting question - if the visuals are so appealing that it sort of draws you to the game - should you give it the extra point?? )

Take Jambo and Agricola (both very good games), then take the worst, artificial parts of goods swapping in Jambo, and the worst, rushed pressure farming of Agricola, and you get my feelings for Loyang.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Personally, I like this game better than Agricola.  This game has fewer text cards to keep track of at one time. 

I like the loan mechanic--you can't pay them back, they simply count against you at the end of the game.  The card choosing mechanic is different, and perhaps the most confusing part of the game, although hardly difficult.

the game moves quickly & because it is a set number of turns, easy to know how long the game will last.

I am sorry it took so long to get this to the table.  How a box looks often determines how quickly we get to it--and I am not drawn to the box "looks" or colors of Loyang.  The components are really nice.

The one drawback is that if you get behind early on in the game, it is very difficult to catch up.  If someone gets a few points ahead early in the game it is likely they can stay there unless they make a mistake.

Like in the movie Top Gun, this is the game where 'your mouth writes checks your body can't cash'.  Why did I take on that extra regular customer?! Again?!

 Great game, not as sprawling and variable as Agricola but easier to get played.  Wooden bits are great.  I think it's expensive, but I've had a blast playing it two player with my daughter.  Our two player games take about 30 min.  I keep seeing people on the Geek complain about the length which I don't understand.  Each turn we ask if anyone is using an interactive helper card, and if not we all complete our actions at once.  Very snappy!

I consider this a great, thinky two player euro.  For more players I would rather play Agricola or something. The whole card phase seems awkward with more than two.

This is a game with a hearth full of math; certainly much more abstract that its cute theme would suggest.

[u]Overview[/u]
The players are farmers who produce and sell vegetables. During every of the nine turns, each of the fields the players have planted produces one vegetable which can be sold, planted, exchanged for other vegetables or be left in the storehouse. The players can play helpers (cards giving special bonuses), merchant stalls (where it's possible to exchange vegetables), regular customers (who need the same two vegetables for four turns) and occasional customers (who want a set of three specific vegetables); when played, these are added to the players' board. Every turn it's also possible to purchase a two-pack (two random cards), take loans (which are not paid back, but simply decrease the loanee's score) and spend money to increase prosperity (prosperity - loans = victory points).

It is important to rapidly expand production, aiming for at least 7 new vegetables per turn, to satisfy two regular and one occasional customers. This maximizes the revenue from the occasional customers and is worth at least a couple of prosperity levels each turn. Players shouldn't forget to keep planting new fields to maintain their influx of vegetables; not paying attention often causes a severe decline in production during the second half of the game. Flexibility and differentiation usually pay off: you'll often have to manage without the cards you really need and producing every vegetable (or at least most of them) means having to rely less on market stalls. Seeing as many cards as possible improves the chances of finding what one needs, so keeping down the price of two-packs and buying them every turn can be very beneficial. Loans seem worth it only if they let you expand your production.

There seem to be too many cards, at least for two players; this makes it rather unlikely, during the card "drafting" phase at the beginning of each turn, to find what you need. The two player version would probably be more strategic and enjoyable with a smaller deck and a little more structure, for example with a couple smaller decks to add to the rest of the cards after 3 and 6 turns, giving the game three distinct phases (focus on expansion, extra regular clients and additional occasional clients). The interactive cards are a good addition, as they gently remind the players to check what their opponent is doing and to ponder over ways to screw them.

Played this twice now, and enjoyed it both times.  i like the mechanics and pieces, and really need another game of this at some point.

due to a maths trade going south i had to send my copy to the third party.  would be interested in getting this back again in exchange for Dominion and potentially more.

The whole game: Figure how many customers you can deliver, figure exactly how you're going to fulfill the deliveries, figure if you can afford to fulfill more deliveries, and so on and so forth. It's not hard stuff, but do that for two hours and tell me you're not bored.

granted, the rating is based only on one game. Nevertheless: for me this is - next to Assyria - the highlight of Essen 2009

after several games: can it be that this game always needs the tie breaker rule as you almost always have the same amount of victory points?!?!? (if yes , i will surely downgrade as replayability will be limited)

O jogo é o irmão mais novo do Agricola e Le Havre. Bom legal de jogar e tende a ser bem mais leve que os irmãos apesar de durar o mesmo tempo, de 150 a 180 minutos. No jogo nós temos que arár o solo, plantar, trocar e vender vegetais para clientes regulares e casuais nos portões de Loyang. Muito bom.

Loyang is quite different from what I expected it to be after the first two titles of the harvest trilogy. Players grow vegetables to sell them to customers and make the most money.

Even though there is some thematic overlap with Agricola it plays very differently. In fact, it is very much multiplayer solitaire. There are, however, a few interactive elements, and because of those players cannot all play simultaneously, leading to serious downtime.

The game is almost entirely tactical since you cannot plan further ahead than a turn or maybe two. At the core, it's a game for optimizers, and that makes some of the interactive cards all the more puzzling: In a game where players sometimes spend 10 minutes per turn slogging to the optimal vegetable delivery chain because a single coin more or less can matter quite a bit, cards that can then simply steal stuff from an opponent seem very much out of place. The injection of interactivity in general is commendable, but this? Seriously?

I like the general idea, and it's quite possible that one should look at it as more of a two-player game, really, but with more it's a bit overly long and drags more than it should.

RATING: 8
Loyang is a pleasant and relatively simple execution of Rosenberg's Harvest mechanic and it works well in the context of this game. Things always feel tight, and one must work hard to edge out over their opponent, which adds a lot of tension.  There is enough to worry about with fulfilling regular customer orders and the like, but there is also enough easy-going stuff so that the game feels less stressful than Agricola, for example.  The workers adds a lot of variety to the game. Too bad this game never figured a real solid 3- or 4-player ruleset, but I think this is still my favourite 2-player Rosenberg, even thinking of later 2-player versions of Agric and Le Havre.

This is such a strange game! The different types of cards are so vastly different, and you get a pretty much random selection of them, yet you're pretty much always trying to wrangle what you're given into a similar sort of plan. I think I'm getting better, probably by buying more 2-packs, but I'm really not sure of that. It's worth playing solitaire as well.

Such a beautiful game, so many cool mechanisms, an so tedious!
There is no flow!!
Comparing multiple alternatives that leads to earning zero or maybe one coin more if 'computed' for five or ten minutes, is (especially when someone else is doing it) not my cup of tea!
I could imagine playing it with people who play it more 'on volley' so to speak. But honestly, this game does not invite to a more free flowing gaming style.

What a surprise this has turned out to be.  Only 2 solo games so far, but it is much, much, much better than expected.  The components are great and the game looks like Agricola, but I think I enjoy this one more.  There is some luck involved with the cards, but so what?  There is still plenty of room for strategy; look carefully, and you will see that a bad first move might cripple you, but careful adjustments later on can save your skin.

This game keeps getting better.  It seems like you need to generate an early engine churning out as many vegetables as you can each round, but that doesn't guarantee success.  If you don't get the right customers, and are missing that one crucial market stall or helper, money can get awfully tight very quickly.  I've had a game I thought was lost turn around with some fortuitous customers, while I've had other games humming along smoothly, only to be derailed by lack of good customers.  

I wonder if this game is improved at all with other players, or if solo is the way to go.

Played with 4 players - and it was fantastic.  Yes, it does have that Princes of Florence solitaire feeling, but there is some interaction during the card phase, and really, the game is so good that it never felt boring.  This is a must-have.

After a 2-player game, I love it even more.  I got killed by a first-time player, but that made it an even better experience.  This game might be the perfect combination of brain-burning puzzle with just the right amount of randomness (cards and fields).

It's up to the full 10 rating now.  We just played a 2-player game in a little over an hour.  With a few more plays, this could easily get down to 45 or 50 minutes.  I managed to hit 17 points with 9 cash left over, but ran out of steam at the end.  There is so much variability in how the game plays depending on the cards, your chosen strategy, and even a bit of what your opponents do.  Buying extra points early is the key, as they get prohibitively expensive later in the game.

Based on one play.

Mechanics are very well done, and it's fun to put together your successful business.

But, comparing it to Agricola (a favorite), we noted:

- A lot of AP, and a very long play time (close to 3 hours).
- Less interaction between players.
- Much more luck-based with the card draws.

Still a fun game, but not one I'd buy or play often.

Purchased this game with the intention of playing it solo, and it does make a great solo game, but I'm finding it's an outstanding 2 player game. It plays like 2 player solitaire, as we take out the competitive cards and play simultaneously, so we can usually pull off 2 games in one hour. I like the puzzle aspect of the game, and the bits are really fun, and I like that there are a couple different strategies that work well.

RATING: 7
Another good game from a good designer, when you are on a roll with vegetables, why change?  This game is tighter and smaller in scope than Agricola, but is still a bit of fun.  It plays quicker & simpler than the fore-mentioned game.  Solo play is actually better than Agricola, with less setup involved and better balance, unfortunately the lack of theme for the solo player is a major short-coming that isn't a problem with multi-player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game is pretty much on the weight level of Agricola and a bit lighter than Le Havre. From a game like that I would expect SOME randomness. Loyang makes one step further - the cards DETERMINE if you can win or not. That's something that fits a family game and for that it's way too heavy. So the game can't decide whether its target is the hardcore gamers group or the family reunion.

I enjoyed playing Loyang and maybe will do it again but it's not a game I would recommend to anyone to start his/hers gaming adventure with. There's something undefined that stops me from liking it.

Plays well; not going to get as many plays as Agricola or Le Havre, but still a reasonable game with its own tricks to master.

I played on Yucata.de and then had to buy a copy.  The wooden bits are awesome.

I only expect to play this 2P, *maybe* the occasional 3P.  There is a lot of thinking to do during your turn, which amounts to a lot of downtime for the opponents.  With 2P, this is reasonable.  The decisions are terrific.  A MUCH better farming game than Agricola!

Third game in the harvest series, and the most different to the others one, At the gates is an excellent two players game that scales also with three and four. May be is not as impressive as other Rosemberg designs but it is by its one a fantastic game, more realxed but aslo quite hard to handle that rewards wise playing. Cards and drafting mechanics are really neat and the bits are lovely. In general, this a very good game just one step below the top euro designs and a game I like to play from time to time since it has both good quality and originality. A bit pricey normally (around 40 euros), but since I got it in a dutch store for just 20 euros, it was a steal.

RATING: 7.5

Update:  I played this game, on back to back days with my wife.  It's fun and enjoyable.  She likes games where it doesn't feel like we are fighting and "competing", and this game definitely doesn't feel like that.  You are largely taking care of your own business, and it's hard to screw someone else over in a big way.  There are minor interactions, and you can definitely try to do that, but by and large, it's a game that feels like you are tending your own vegetable patch.

I'm not super interested in playing the game with 4 players, as I think it would just get long.  We played our second game in an hour, which is what this game feels like it should be with two people.  If playing with 4, I think you would need to play the actions phases simultaneously or something, in order to speed up the game a bit, otherwise, you are looking at a 2 hour deal for a game without the weight and depth that sort of timeframe warrants.

One thing though - for a similar price, both MSRP and actual from amazon/miniature market, it's much less components than are found in Agricola.  I think I would just expect more pieces for a game in that price range, or to for it to have a lower price tag.  While I bought it for 20, and am fine withe price, it just felt a little light for a $60 MSRP.

RATING: 8
At the Gates of Loyang is what I call a mini-puzzle game.  Each turn presents you with a tactical mini-puzzle that you must solve.  This category would include games such as Antiquity, Factory Fun, Mr. Jack, RoboRally, Babel, Goldland, Expedition, Uruk, Key Harvest, Java, and Jambo.  You must efficiently chain several small actions in order to shuffle around vegetables and fields and money and cards.  Money is extremely tight, and that's what makes the game work.  There is a constant tension between earning immediate cash and investing for future turns.  The reason for the tension is that you buy victory points at the end of each turn, and points purchased early in the game are much cheaper than points purchased late.

I like the game best by far with two players.  Why bother keeping track of three other players when almost everything you do doesn't involve them at all?  The four-player game is a little weird in that you pair off into two parallel two-player universes each turn, but does also allow a broader selection of cards to pass through the game - which is nice if you're looking for something in particular.  I avoid playing with three because there is simply too much downtime.

There is very little interaction among the players in Loyang,  Whether this is a bug or a feature depends on your tolerance/enjoyment of very solitaire-ish games.  For example, it's significantly less interactive than Le Havre, Agricola, Race for the Galaxy, and Dungeon Lords, and a bit less interactive than most games of Dominion.  I would rate it equal to Factory Fun or Galaxy Trucker in level of player interaction.

To me, Loyang does not feel similar to Agricola or Le Havre.  Instead, it wouldn't be too crazy to think of Loyang as Antiquity: The Card Game.  There's a very clear lineage from Antiquity which the designer makes explicit in his notes.  It's most obvious in the harvest mechanism, but it goes beyond that to include the entire feel and style of the game.

[Update] At the Gates of Loyang has gotten a LOT of play as a solitaire game. In part, this is because I seem to like the game more than my gaming neighbors. But mostly, it's because this is such an outstanding solitaire game. The weakest part of the multiplayer game is the card drafting phase. In the solitaire game, this is replaced by a matrix-like card display where you can see and manipulate coming attractions. The card matrix allows you to plan ahead better, and makes the puzzle-solving aspect of the game trickier and more interesting.

I currently would rate the game:
9 for 1 player
8 for 2 players
5 for 3 players (takes WAY too long)
6 for 4 players

I don’t see the latest three games by Uwe Rosenberg as a trilogy as they are all quite different. The most striking similarity between them is that they are all fiddly. That is however not something I am concerned with. Neither am I concerned that the game is a little solitaire.

The game feels quite tactical because you have little information on what is going to come up in future rounds, so what you do is try to squeeze out maximum points each round. The money is tight and getting points get more expensive later in the game.

I give heads up that the game is one of the few games that really play well solo, which is good because I don’t think it will get much love from my regular gaming group. It has a well-executed theme and lovely art and components.

Solitaire: solid economic game. Lots of options, and enough randomization to keep it interesting and replayable. Probably the best solo game of the trilogy (better than Agricola and Le Havre).

RATING: 5
If you only consider the idea, the mechanic, the graphic design and how the game works "technically", Loyang is definitely a 8 or 9 since it is designed flawlessly.  However, even the most perfect design can be boring, tiring or simply annoying.

This game can only be described as "Multiplayer solitaire with considerable downtime".  This is no longer fun, it's work, it's work which you do alone, and it's painful work if you have a player in your group who plays slowly. I don't see why I should sit down for 2-3 hours with some friends, not talking at all and twisting my brain on how to optimize my food production and sales.  One of our players said yesterday: "Next time I'd suggest that everybody plays at home alone.  And when you're done you phone your buddies and tell them your final score."

Uwe Rosenberg is surely one of the most intelligent game designers of our time, but his games have recently become more and more autistic.  Bohnanza is a brilliant masterpiece of interaction.  Agrcicola is also excellent but already has a considerable solo aspect which even increased with Le Havre. But with Gates of Loyang he has created a board game which reduces the entire idea of gaming to absurdity.  

COME ON!  GAMING IS A SOCIAL ACTIVITY!

Edit: Raised rating fom 2 to 5 because I have to admit that Loyang is a pretty good solo puzzle.  I got a copy for 10 Euro at the Spiel 2012 in Essen and I'm actually enjoying it.  However, I still do not consider this a game in the sense of something you want tomplay together with your friends.

I must say I have been very pleased with Loyang.  There are constant decisions to be made, and most of them are tough.  There seem to be a multitude of options and strategies to pursue, and none of them seem to be foolproof or formidable.  For the most part, players can execute their plans and strategies without an abundance of interference from their opponents.  There are some helpers that do allow some tampering with an opponent's markets or cards, and while these are usually troublesome, they aren't devastating.  Further, as mentioned earlier, cards which affect an opponent only affect one's "partner".  While some have complained that this gives the game a Solitaire feel, I disagree.  There is enough interaction not only by the use of these cards, but also in the card selection process.  I feel there is just enough to keep matters interesting, but not intrusive.

The most significant problem I have with the game is its length.  Each game I've played has lasted three hours or more.  I've mentioned many times previously that I don't mind longer games, but Loyang seems to drag a bit in the middle rounds.  The game would seem to maintain more if its excitement if it could be played in two hours or so.  Some groups might be able to accomplish this, but we have not come close to that mark.  However, the somewhat excessive duration has not been enough to force me to abandon the game.  Every game I have played has been tense and exciting, with one even being decided via a tie-breaker (most cash).  There is a growing sense of anxiety as the game progresses as you try to pull your plan together and squeeze out a few more coins to advance just one more space on the prosperity track. Loyang continues to intrigue, which keeps me going back in time for yet another rich experience at the gates of this ancient city.

I want to like this game more than I do but its design shows its age a bit. The card drafting mechanic is laborious in a 3 or 4-player game and the interactive helper cards seem an attempt to bring life into what is, essentially, a multiplayer solitaire game and are just frustrating when the game depends so heavily on planning. It's probably a great single or 2-player game but it's not for me and far too long as a 3 or 4-player game.

Not enough tough choices in the game.  The game practically plays itself.  Beautiful game and designed well enough, but just not enough game here.  Takes too long to boot.  Worst of the Uwe's "Harvest" games by quite a margin.
Best as 2 player because of downtime issues with more players.
Coming from a HUGE Agricola fan, and, to a lesser extent, Le Havre admirer, this was a huge disappointment.

RATING: 5
On my first play of this game, I found the number of decisions to be made a little overwhelming.  Do I want to keep this card or that one?  If I discard it, what can someone else do with it if they take it?  What do the special cards do?  Will I be able to attack someone with this card, and does it matter whether I go last/2nd-last and get to choose a victim?

Planting lots of fields that match the demands of your regular customers seems to be the name of the game.  But after 4 successful rounds, your regulars are fulfilled, and you have to change your economy to grow something else, so that can be a challenge.  And the challenge is different depending on how many rounds are left at the point that a supply field or a demand card is depleted.

I should play this again to get a better feel for how to win, but I'd rather play many other games instead (including several other games by Uwe Rosenberg).  And frankly, the luck factor of the card draw is too high -- if you get a great helper (or set of helpers), or draw the right demand card at the right time, you end up with extra resources that can help you disproportionately to other players, which is just not fair.  At least in Agricola and Le Havre, the randomness is limited to the beginning draw, not renewed throughout.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A brain burner with a lot of down time.  Essentially a game of resource swapping... Way too long for what it is (over 2.5 hours + 30 minutes of rules explanations).

Card selection mechanic is interesting but does not alleviate the randomness issue.  Essentially you need to wait and hope that someone will lay down the card you are looking for.  If you have two good cards in hand, you have to take a chance and lay one down and hope no one selects it so you may select it on your next pass...  A weird approach for a card draft mechanic.

Once a player falls behind, there is next to no chance of getting back into the game, as the interaction is somewhat limited (and convoluted with 4-players and the aweful "partner" rule, where you may only interact, negatively, with the "partner" selected).

Score: 19-19-17-15
For the player at "15", he/she needed 16+17 (30) coins to join 3rd place, and another +18+19 (70) to tie with first...  When you are generating a little over 20 per turn, you are somehow 3 turns behind the leaders, and are not generating enough cash to have a chance to catch up.  Loans could work, but the cost renders it useless as the price is a FULL point PER 5 coins at the END of the game, per card.  OUCH.

In a 4-player game, the "Con Man" card is next to impossible to target, as a quadruple planet alignment needs to occur first.  This card works better in a 3-player game, where there is no "partner" limitation.

Don't expect to play this again, and canceled my order.

RATING: 6
This is a great game for 2 - while it i mostly 2 player solitaire, it works very well for a game in which players are racing against one another to build up their economy via buying and selling vegetables. This fits the bill when my partner and I want to play a longer game (like Jambo) without (potential) aggression (like Jambo).

These days Uwe has been releasing a lot of designs that just don't appeal to me. Many have had spatial elements or been totally overwrought. The harvest trilogy is my pick for Uwe's best games, and Loyang is definitely the best of the bunch for solo play. While my favorite of the series is Le Havre, I think each game has an excellent complexity/payoff ratio. They get the gears turning without needing constant rulebook references, they move at a good pace, and they reward repeated plays.

Loyang is particularly good for solo play because it is not just an engine builder where you are snowballing, but it's an optimization game where you need to take risks early on to get a good score by the end of the game. Order fulfillment, production management, and a bit of card play all come together to make this a wonderful meaty euro 

Best with 1-2

Rating is primarily based on solitair play. Loyang is a perfect solitair game which I currently prefer to Agricola and Le Havre due to the much shorter set-up time. However, I also really enjoy the multiplayer game (having only played with 4 so far). I do not have a problem with the low degree of interaction and did find myself constantly checking the other player's customers and stalls for methods of screwing them. 

Loyang is lighter than both Agricola and Le Havre - less thematical than the first and much less work than the latter.

Vegetables; Plant them, sow them, sell them, trade them, do anything with them, but just don't *eat* them! The scoring mechanism keeps things feeling close and tense. While the action phase may seem to be the most important part of the game, it is the card (and distribution) phase that is the meat in an otherwise vegetarian game (pardon the pun). Quite fun and enjoyable.

A pretty simple game in comparison to Uwe Rosenberg's last two releases. Sow fields, harvest the vegetables, then try to fulfil the orders of customers who visit your stall. A sizeable luck element in what cards you're dealt, especially in the 'two pack' card purchase mechanism. I'm not sure 9 rounds were really necessary, as an optimisation game it's vulnerable to overthink, so it can stretch to 2 hours+ which is bordering on overstayed welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a charming game that presents players with lots of things they can do to generate more stuff and a lot of control over their turn.  I like that a lot, and the components are absolutely irresistible.  However, I must admit that the game has some flaws.  The interaction is very low--I'm tempted to just play it in solitaire mode instead--and the downtime is high, but most disappointingly, it's entirely possible for players to win and lose before the end of the game. So the end in particular is kind of a letdown, but the beginning and middle are great.  

For what it's worth, later plays were more even among players.  Oddly, there is much less downtime for four players than for three. (3 plays)

Played on Yucata only. 

After getting hang of the rules, this is pretty neat little game. It is very much solitaire. I think it's perfectly fine game to play on Yucata, because there it is a lot work to play games where you need to closely follow what others do. You need to click open some subwindows and remember what was there etc. IRL you generally can see the whole game state at a glance.

Other than that theres not really much to say. You try to optimize your money making engine so that you get points.

RATING: 7.25
Es un juego medio-pesado de gestión económica con algo (o bastante, según opiniones) de azar en las cartas. En tres palabras "puzzle de optimización". Ocupa un lugar inferior a sus dos hermanos mayores (Agricola y Le Havre) en la trilogía de las cosechas, pero no por ello es mal juego, ya que a fecha de hoy estamos hablando que no supera a los juegos que ocupan el nº2 y el nº 6 del ránking de bgg. Es el más táctico y el más ligero de los tres, ya que estás limitado a 4 cartas distintas por turno que te impiden hacer cálculos a largo plazo. Buena idea la  del "draft de cartas", que dificulta tener siempre tu jugada favorita. También es interesante la mecánica de los clientes (una especie de comensales de un restaurante a quienes debes servir los vegemeeples pues su paciencia es limitada y si les hartas, te penalizarán) PROS: "Vegemmeples", más corto que sus hermanos mayores. Funciona mejor que los otros dos en solitario y a dos jugadores. CONTRAS:  Excesivamente matemático para lo que ofrece, lo que favorece el A/P. Elevado "downtime" a más de 2 jugadores. Parece que jugar a 4 jugadores es forzar demasiado el sistema. ¿Dura 9 turnos y te putearán en dos de ellos y no podrás hacer nada? No hay traducción oficial al español: todo en inglés.

After a few times through, I'm a bit conflicted on this one.  On the one hand, I do enjoy the game system - though it's definitely more towards the puzzle end of the spectrum, it's a very enjoyable puzzle that has a bit of that ol' Agricola time crunch (though to a much lesser extent).  On the other hand, the extreme lack of player interaction brings down the game to a surprising degree.  After one game my wife remarked, "why not just play the solo version?" and I don't really have a good answer for that (though the endgame did see a little bit of cross-player screwage on both our parts).  I really wish Mr. Rosenberg had found a way to integrate a little more player interaction into the design.

[2016-11] Игра Уве Розенберга "про урожай".

из обзора:
Пропитание как расплата за развитие наступает в конце каждого раунда в «Агриколе» и «Гавре». Над игроками висит дамоклов меч расплаты за недостаточное усердие в этом вопросе. Это заставляет разделять свою тактику на два фронта: добудь пропитание и постарайся сделать это максимально эффективно, чтобы побольше действий осталось на непосредственное развитие фермы (постройку зданий/кораблей). По этому фактору игровой процесс «Лояна» выделяется более простой формулой цели игрока: больше денег и никаких дополнительных стремлений. Возможно, именно поэтому в среде искушенных и опытных игроков эта игра не достигла высших строчек рейтинга: слишком проста.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A charming economic game with relatively relaxed competition. The pleasant tactility of sowing and harvesting the wooden crops in your fields is appealing. 

(I do wish the crops had been tailored to the setting rather than re-used from Agricola; it's easy enough to call the wheat "rice," but it's harder to ignore the pumpkins--a New World plant somehow in Han Dynasty China. Minor gripe, I know.)

It has a lot more luck than you might expect from what seems like a classic Euro, and as such many of the decisions feel reactionary rather than planned out (though I could just be inexperienced with it). That limited ability to form strategies ahead of time means it's not the sort of game you'll think about when you're not playing it, but still it seems like something I'd rarely turn down if it were suggested.

RATING: 7.5
No doubt,  a good game.  Rosenberg does not disappoint.

Each round you try to solve 'the puzzle' (earn the most of money) and it's challenging, but what's really interesting is the interaction with other players (using their resources, blocking them, messing up with their plans).  Interestingly some people don't see this interaction... Odd.

The game is definitely on tactical (rather than strategic) side and that (among other things) make it very different from Agricola/Le Havre.  Hence it's hard to say about 'Rosenberg's trilogy', despite some people make this notion...

WARNING: 4-player game is basically unplayable - too long (despite playing in pairs) and too complex.  By the latter I mean that you are unable to study _exactly_ what's going in other players' tableaux.  And you cannot plan/predict interactions (->Card Phase as well as using helpers), because of way too many variables.  And very precise planning is absolutely crucial in this game...

RATING: 6
Might be the weakest of the three sure but look at the games you are comparing this too, very strong games so keep that in perspective.

Essentially a contract filling engine game with a similar theme to its brothers that is once again strongly integrated.  There is a new mechanic here where everyone starts their turn with four cards but will only keep one. The first player plays one of the cards into a "common pool", next player can take a card from the pool and keep one of his own but then adds the rest of his hand to the pool and "bows out" OR just add one to the pool and kind of pass.  This continues until each player ends up with two cards, one from the pool and one from his hand, holding out to the end gives you a small? advantage to go first so just a tad push your luck maybe. This works fairly good overall and feels fresh. 

Long term planning is not really possible here like in Gric or Le Havre (anyone that thinks Agricola does not have long term planning doesn’t fully grasp the game or just chooses to ignore it, its there in spades [order of cards from get-go and order of farm built adjusting all on the fly]) but there is a little.  Here you just want to plant as much veggies as possible in order to give you more options and in order to sell as much as possible for more money to buy more points.  You don’t know really WHAT to plant though sometimes as future customers come up randomly BUT there seems to be a lot of everything so I don’t think you’ll get too screwed, you just cant make too specific of plans, still a meaty game though. So the game is largely tactical and might offer a bit less and due to this should maybe be a bit shorter to keep its appeal, it would be nice to keep it to 90 minutes or 2 hours max with 4 players, 2 hours should be possible. 

More luck here than the other games unless you dont draft in Gric which I think would be silly, you just have to draft unless you really LOVE luck. Here which customers you get and how many you get are somewhat random, when the game comes down to 6 dollars for a win, this wont be too satisfying and this burnt someone just like that in one game near the end. There are also extra fields that come out which can help you BIG and then there is the "market bitch" as I dubbed her. I needed the veggies from my market stall for a contract and the market bitch lets another player steal my whole market stall...ouch! Players can also rip off some of your veggies from your garden and a single from your market stall, in fact most of the interaction in the game, which is almost non-existent, is from slight screwage cards (and the common pool draft). There might be enough to go around to balance out and our games were close, it looks like a pretty tight game where 4 players could all end with the same VP count and it comes to a money tie-break so I’m not sure how much of a factor this is yet. Apparently Uwe makes a suggestion to start with one regular customer and I think this might be a good idea (although this was for a "family version"? to make it easier but at least it will get you started and you'll know what to plant at the beginning for the first one)

Unless you just decide to all play simultaneous (after resolving the interaction/screwage cards) you are looking at some downtime here which causes it to drag. I think it might be a good idea to resolve the cards that matter and then everyone just go through their own actions, this would cut down some time otherwise you have nothing to plan for while you wait as well. Even still it might be one round or two rounds too long, similar to Le Havre for me. It might be best as 2 player just due to game length (although you could just play Jambo maybe....LOL) however tweaking the 3 or 4 player to be shorter is not something I'm afraid of... ;) My rating would be a little higher if game was shorter. 

Oh yes and the game is mostly cards and empty box, I would sure hope the English release will have a reduced price compared to the others in the trilogy everything considered. Rating will end between 7 and 8 for me most likely. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think this is in my opinion Uwe's weakest design. The things you're doing is somewhat interesting, where you juggle the produce between the different farm patches to fulfill customer's demands. There are some helper cards that help make your job easier. But in the 2 games I've played almost everyone scores the same number of points every round. And its usually won by the player who chose to switch from keeping money to buying VP earliest that won the game. I might be wrong but it certainly felt that way to me.

Also, I'm not certain I like the road to prosperity scoring mechanism.

Preliminary rating based on five solo games and two 3-player games.  I am enjoying the solo game, and it gives me a feeling for the general flow of the game and the thought process around action sequence chains. In my games I have made many a mistake, not in the rules but in play tactics, and only ended up with 13, 14, 15, 15 & 16 (ack... loans).  Lots of room to grow there :).  I can definately see how first games can be time consuming, but my pacing picked up as I went along.  Even in solo play I have been able to play some satisfying moves.  Can't wait to try a two-or multi-player game.

Current solo best: 16 + 1 cash

After playing my first two multi-player games my rating rises.  Everyone has enjoyed the game and despite the BGG fear our three-player games didn't seem to drag too badly.

Still deferring judgment, but the game seems hugely dependent on a few cards which are wicked strong (mainly regular customers and extra fields).

Edit: it's more balanced, after a few plays, but early fields are still unreal strong, and there's just not enough interesting decisions. On top of that, the game is really just too long with virtually no variance or real sense of progress.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2013)

I’m a huge Rosenberg fan. I still haven’t played a design from him I haven’t enjoyed. At the Gates of Loyang is not a bad game BUT it is perhaps one of the worst Rosenberg games I have tried, that’s not to say it is a bad game. Also I have to confess that I have only played it online so I need to play it face to face to see if that changes my mind about the game. When I do, I will come back and re comment.

For now I can say the theme seems very boring to me (Agricola´s and Le Havre´s theme is also boring but they are GREAT games) and, at first blush, it isn’t as deep as I’m accustomed from his games (but it retains its characteristically high playtime which is a minus here). Most of my games have been very close so I have felt the ending is a bit anticlimactic.

Bottom line, I need to play it again.

I finally played the game face to face. It is a gorgeous game with all the vegetable bits. Also I have never played it with four players so the distribution phase was a mystery to me :D, now I understand.

It continues to be an OK game for me. This time I was able to buy a lot of VPs (unlike my online games), but still the game was very close so the anticlimactic feel I had before continues to appear. The issue here is that scoring more than 2 VPs in later stages can be very hard to accomplish.

In this game you feel you are playing by yourself (multiplayer solitaire), very low player interaction. I know there are some “attack” cards but the feeling persisted even after playing them. That would be ok if the game´s playtime wasn’t as long as it is. I’m also worried about the luck of the draw. I’m not sure if the luck is controllable or not. Sure, you can be creative when getting your vegetables (and it is fun to do this), but if other players have an easier time (less effort and resources) getting theirs, I feel they will win the game more often.

Bottom line, a good looking game, but it isn’t at the same level of Le Havre and Agricola (much lighter, increased luck) with similar play times. I need to try At the Gates of Loyang with 2 players face to face to see if it improves. I will keep in it in my game collection for now, but it has a high chance its rating will decrease.

RATING: 7
I'm not sure what game I'd compare this to; certainly not the other members of the harvest trilogy.  I see how the vegetable planting is inspired by Antiquity but I'm not sure I see any other similarities other than the limited player interaction.  There are a lot of tradeoffs - steady income from regular customers vs. one-time bonuses from casual customers, early points (not the sucker bet they are in many resource management games) vs. infrastructure building.  Unsurprisingly for a Rosenberg title, the game feels very tight - not unlike Agricola where it seems like the most fun turn would be round 15, Loyang feels like it would be more fun with a few more options on each turn.

I appreciate that, for a resource management game, Loyang tries to break up the snowball by providing mild incentives to sink money into points early.

I think I'm playing this game exclusively 2-player unless all players are experienced.  The first game, a 4p learning affair, took over 3 hours which isn't acceptable.  Loyang wants to be finished in 90 minutes or less.

Did not like this at first...tried learning the game with 3 players and it felt long and painful.  Now it really flows and a 2-player game really shines.

Described as "Agricola mk 2", (but probably more like "Agicola beta" if you want to be historically correct).  I disagree.  There is an Agricola-like feel to the slow build of the game to a set ending point, but other than that the similarity ends.  Except that it's a brain burner to try and find the solution to your problems, and a ton of really detailed fun.

Found a very cheap copies at local stores for 30$. I hear this one plays really good by yourself, so I see no reason not to pick this one up down the road.

+ Picked up, and finished my first solo game. This is a great 'solo' game that I can enjoy. This game feels like it was mainly designed to be played solo. Played very smooth, and variability between each game is amazing. I am not sure whether I would play this game with somebody else; I would play Agricola, or Le Havre with others. But when I am by myself, I would prefer this over other two. But other two still plays great solo, but in those games, solo games felt like an afterthought.

+ Another plus was that this game came with grain, and veggie tokens (+ kinda reed-ish looking... white tokens) that I can use in Agricola :).

This is the game that I wish Agricola could of been. Here you sell your vegatbles, since I don't eat any, what a deal. Great playing pieces. Nine rounds of brain thinking activity. Plant vegatbles, use helpers and feed regular customers and walk up casual customers. You are not alone, helpers come to assist you. The game drafting in the competive mode is a little dauting to casual gamers. The solo version is incredible. There is very little action with your opponents, so the competive game is almost like playing solitary. This is a game that I will play solo quite often. A smooth game. Helpers wording could of been explained better on the cards but thats what BGG is for. Easily one of the best solo games in the world. Enjoy.

Opinions get skewed by comparison to Agricola and Havre; but judged in itself (as a medium-weight-puzzle-game) has a charm all its own.  Bits of St Petersburg, SJ, Antiquity, Agricola, Jambo, Bohnanza. Rated strictly as solo.  The solitaire rules eliminate most of the commonly cited defects (AP, too long, no interaction).  The "plant and harvest" mechanism is very sweet. The design overall is tight, with lots of self-regulating checks and balances. Rule book well written. Overpriced and boxed--both should be cut in half. The 2-3 player game introduces a card draft but it doesn't mix with the cerebral analysis/calculation the rest of game entails. So I think I'll stick to solo.  The 4p version seems artificial and weird. I wonder if it was designed solo then adapted? (See my [thread=587230]review[/thread].)

I admit I have only played this game solo as yet. This is a great puzzle game. You play against your all time best game and once you learn the game you begin to see all the rich options in front of you. The challenge is choosing the best one. So many possibilities and all from a fairly simple set of rules... I enjoy this game a lot and I might just say it is my favorite solo game. A differ puzzle every time. I can't wait to try this two player or more. There is an option to remove all the cards with all red lantern on them, these cards are cards that give you direct interaction with other players. If you are looking for that great but I take them out when when I play and the game is plays unaffected.  In a two player game I wouldn't add them.

One play makes me want to play more - a good sign that this is another excellent game by Herr Rosenberg. It is really different from his other big box games.

Nice game that's a bit difficult to get into at first. The game is about playing cards to make money by taking best advantage of upcoming harvests of vegetables. You are trying to time the two aspects of the game to work together. More card-driven and chaotic than the other harvest trilogy games, this still quite fun trying to fit the pieces together. Play degrades with higher player counts because of a lack of interaction and increasing down-time between turns. However, with two players this shines. A good, strategic 2-player game that is not an abstract or a war game is hard to find. With Loyang, you've found it!

RATING: 8
Se parece al Agricola pero en mi opinión es bastante diferente.

Loyang es un juego en solitario, no tiene demasiada interacción entre jugadores. Durante la primera fase de cada ronda tus acciones pueden afectar a otro jugador al coger una carta del centro de la mesa, y durante la fase de acción puedes usar los tableros del resto de jugadores utilizando a tus ayudantes... y eso es todo. No hay pelea por colocarse en la mejor acción.

Por otro lado, en tu turno eres libre de hacer lo que quieras. Debes combinar tus acciones para poder optimizar tus recursos. Eso es una cosa que está bien ya que puedes desarrollar fácilmente tu estrategia pero hace muy difícil que los otros jugadores te puedan parar.

Como he dicho antes, bastante diferente del Agricola, pero es un buen rompecabezas.

It looks like Agricola but in my opinion it is quite different.

Loyang is a solo game, there is not so much interaction with the other players. During the first phase of a round your actions can affect another player by choosing a card from the pool, and during the action phase you can use the boards of the rest of the players by using your helpers... and that's all. No struggle for choosing the best action.

On the other hand, during your turn you are free to do whatever you want to do. You have to combine your actions in order to optimize your resources. That's good because you can easily develop your strategy but that's make quite difficult other player to stop you.

As I previously said, quite different game from Agricola, but a really nice puzzle to solve.

Purchased Essen 2009. After playing one solo game and one two-player game, my tentative rating is a 6. First impressions (and don't take it for anything else, more plays might change my opinion :)) is that the two-player game didn't feel too different from the solo game, other than the fact that you had to wait for your turn (and a different mechanism for choosing cards of course). In other words, it didn't feel that interactive and felt more like multiplayer solitaire - probably good if you like that kind of thing, but I prefer a bit more interaction.

Update: Didn't feel any great urge to play this again, so when the opportunity presented itself I decided to sell it off.

Only played it solo so far, and have already found its a much better solo game than Agricola and Le Havre. It does not seem to have quite got the same reception as either of those games. My feeling is that I will probably end up playing this the most of the three.

It is definately a much lighter game than the other two, and I think that is good. I don't mind complex games but I have to be in the right mood to play them. With lighter games I'm likely to feel like playing them more often.

You certainly don't get as much in the box as you do with the other two either. I remember the first time I picked up an Agricola box, it felt like there was a real farm inside.

Still you pay for the game not the componenets and I think this is going to be a good one.

Played a two player game now and enjoyed it a lot. Still a bit puzzled by people who say it takes to long. We finished it in under an hour. Stop thinking to much people, just enjoy playing as game.

A game of extreme constraint in which you squeeze tiny advances from the system and spend the whole game in a tight pack with your opponents until one of you wins by a third of a point. Or, if you ignore the game's ridiculous (and nearly pointless) conversion of money to points, one of you wins by a handful of coins. [sarcasm]Let me tell you how excited this gets me.[/sarcasm]

The discussion of At the Gates on the forums has been quite insightful, so if you've read up on it you won't be surprised to hear that it's a meatier take on Jambo with Agricola's harvest mechanic. You manage a group of fields and a stable of customers in order to maintain something resembling an income. You use the income to purchase points, which gradually get more expensive every turn. On your turn you juggle a bunch of little calculations hoping to hit a burst of synergy from the cards, which, by the way, suck for you most of the time. The card drafting phase is all about finding the cards that don't completely suck at that particular moment. Let me tell you how... oh, wait.

Quite a complex game, won't purchase but will play.

Don't EVER play this with anyone who suffers from AP!

This is essentially Jambo with a drafting mechanism for cards combined with a harvest supply mechanism for goods.

Not sure if I need a more complex version of Jambo.

I suffered some AP (First time ever for me) with this game 2 player (took 1:45), i can imagine that 4 players will be a nightmare. I can see that Uwe has tried to design around by 2 partners doing their actions together, but even so it seems inelegant.

Trying to work out the optimum trades and deliveries bearing in mind the Trader card etc. is asking for trouble.

Overall a decent gamers game, but one that requires more plays than i'll probably give it to unravel its full potential. Feels even more 'solitaire' than Agricola.

**Update** Offered a game last night.... and refused felt that there were just better games to play so updated my rating accordingly. Played nexus Ops instead and had more fun in less time.

**Update** Masses of copies on sale at my FLOGS says it all.

Oh, Uwe. Don't know how I missed this one but I'm so glad I finally got my hands on a copy. Great medium-weight farming sim and fits nicely between something like Agricola or Caverna and the much simpler All Creatures Big and Small. I kinda DO wish there was just a little more complexity compared to its little brother but I'm still very happy to own it. Now Uwe just needs to revive a 8 year old game with a new expansion. Yeah...that'll happen. Also, leekles.

The challenge is to find the best solutions to the logistical puzzles Loyang throws at you. Each player faces another challenge each turn which he tackles mostly on its own. There are a few cards that interfere with other players' moves but I can understand why many people prefer this with only two or even as a solitaire exercise as almost all of the challenge is kept but downtime is reduced. As all recent Rosenberg games, setup and stowing away of the tons of material alone takes longer than some games play. Enjoyable but I'm not compelled to own it as I already don't have enough opportunities to explore Agricola or Le Havre and I'm not sure if it offers enough for the needed 2-3 hours.

RATING: 6
A cute little game of farming vegetables and selling them at a profit. The core of the game is setting up an economic engine to expand your vegetable production to serve an ever increasing number of customers, while simultaneously siphoning off money into buying victory points (which you want to do early and do often due to some built in incentives). The economic system itself is very simple.

The main spice to the system comes from getting two cards a round into your tableau (e.g. different kinds of customers, special action cards). This is done with a simple drafting system. This is perhaps my biggest issue with the game. The cards are of very variable values, and since everyone always gets to keep one card of the 4 they buy, the random card draws each turn have a pretty big effect. It's very annoying to see others gaining extra fields while you're stuck with mediocre helpers, or those certain permanent customers you desperately need never coming from the very large draw deck that gets constantly shuffled.

All in all, I enjoyed Loyang, and expect to play it a lot more. It's no Agricola, but then few things are.

Used to be my wife and mine's favorite two player game. Calculation acrobatics and juggling skills required! Relatively light rule set and few card variations(for Uwe) nevertheless make for an always tough (never got to 19 yet!) and engaging evening's play session.

RATING: 8
It's hard to not make comparisons to Rosenberg's previous big box games, but after 8 plays, I feel like there's probably less to explore, but the big plus is that my wife really enjoys the game and asks to play it - she likes it more than the other two.

The theme and the wooden vegetable pieces are two of the best thing the game has going for it.  With experienced players (and especially with 2) the playing time is a lot more attractive than Le Havre, but I would still only want to play this with 2 or 3 (like Le Havre).

Some of the prevalent complaints don't bother me.  I can see how people don't like the scoring track.  It is easy to knock down your scoring marker, but you usually remember where you are.  It's true that most games will come down to the money tiebreaker, but you just have to see each coin as a victory point to get over that hump.  There is definitely a lot of luck in the card draw, but especially with 2 players I think there are a lot of cards to choose from and it is very unlikely that the available cards would hamper your game.

I like how you can trade and sell vegetables and how you have more as the game flows. Nice the game does not have the tension to feed your family, as it is there in Agricola.

It's hard to beat this game on cuteness, but the game itself is also very nice! It's high on puzzling, this game of trying to maximize your yields and your customers, like a light version of dungeon petz. I also adore the scoring system that makes it equally hard to lag behind as to get ahead. You have to put in a big effort to get even one square ahead! Combine this with the cuteness and you have a winner.

Nice wooden bits, but I hate the way I feel when I play this game. Five minutes into it, I can't wait for the end. It has something to do with being forced to commit myself to fulfilling a long-term goal when I have only the merest short-term control over my ability to do so. And there are all those negative points hanging over the failure to complete the goal. Games should feel lighthearted even when their mechanics may be heavy. This one is lighter than some games I love, but it feels miserable. If you like the market aspect but not the stress, I would recommend [thing=12002][/thing].

Was disappointed with this one after the first play.  Willing to give it another chance but just can't imagine picking this over dozens of games I enjoy more.

If it could be played in 45 minutes, rating would go up.

RATING: 7
Played that with a group of 4 at Spiel '09 on Friday afternoon. I like the game itself and the process of seeding, harvesting and card drafting & playing.

But I have one problem with Loyang at first. You can't plan ahead or a strategy and just have to make good tactical decisions during card drafting & action phase. So the downtime applies mainly to the dropped cards. I like downtime when I can make strategic decisions until it's my turn agin. But the downtime from Loyang was only tactical. 

Additionally I asked myself why the game takes 9 rounds and not 7 or 8. Might be interesting to ask beta testers, if they know the reason. I had the feeling that one could house-rule a round or two away.

I hope things speed up when all players are more experienced. Right now I'd prefer to play Agricola. But Loyang will be played again. I like it. Not more, not less.

Update:
The game seems to grow exceptionally after a second play. Therefore I bought it and eager to gain more experience :)

Update:
The solo version is awesome. I upped my rating by 0.5. Not ready to get a final conclusion for the 2-4 player version, but I'm more posivite compared to my Essen experience and will likely go up to 9 in a couple of weeks.

Update2:
It was not played a lot during the last year unfortunately. I would only consider to play it 1- or 2-player.

Ejha, hát ez meglepett... Nagyon más, mint a többi gazdálkodós Rosenberg és végre egy olyan, aminek nem 30 perc az előkészítése. Háááát, egy kicsit necces az interakció benne, mert azért az elég kemény, amikor az ellenfél a mi kuncsaftunkat, pultunkat használja. Szóval a konfrontáció is nagyon más, mint az Agricolákban, Cavernában. Ugyanakkor emiatt 2 fővel a legideálisabb, 3-asban, 4-esben probléma lehet ez a egymás cuccainak használata.

---------------------------

As someone who doesn't usually like economic games, I really like this one. Possibly because there are no auctions. So much so, I built a web version of the solo game. I wish Chloe liked it enough to pick it up, I'll wait till I can buy a second hand copy off someone I think.

A good cerebral exercise with fantastic components and perhaps a little too high playtime. Really feels complete, the only possible expansion I can see is adding another vegetable type, or perhaps weed infested fields. Hmmm, I might try that as a variant.

One of Uwe Rosenberg's "Harvest Trilogy" games. To date, I haven't played a Uwe Rosenberg game that I disliked. This economical thinker has you place out varying cards with different abilities in each of 4 types. On your turn you can pick up a card from the offer and one from your hand to go out of the round. This to me has a similar feel to Zooloretto with less consequences for waiting too long, though you can be rewarded properly for pushing your luck. Otherwise, on your turn you are sowing vegetables/buying others/selling even more still and fulfilling customer demands and orders and using helpers to help you better accomplish this. After all of this happens you can spend your money to buy happiness (Victory Points). The game is intuitive and the working parts all mesh well together. The theme is decent. You can see your sown fields and your available vegetables to use. The components are brilliant. The box comes stocked with vegimeeples that add even more flash to the game! I would like to pick this one up to finish up my collection of The Harvest Trilogy.

Interesting trading game. Typical story: get goods, sell to customers and buy victory points. Yet, the familiar mechanisms are nicely blended together and offer an engaging intellectual experience.

I can appreciate the clever overall design of the game, but unfortunately At The Gates of Loyang is way too long and repetitive to be any fun. The game doesn't have any sort of dramatic arc, every turn is pretty much the same except sometimes there is more of the same and sometimes less of the same.

Also: Any game where players can play at the same time since nobodys actions affect any other players is a automatically a miss for me, since I enjoy games which offer plenty of player interaction.

While this is likely my least favorite of the three latest offerings from Uwe, this one still has some interesting things going on within the game and it is beautifully produced!  Much of the game play is solo, however, with very little opportunity to really effect other people in their planting, harvesting, and selling of different veggies.  The game does intertwine some interesting aspects to the game with casual vs regular customers, special helpers that allow you to bend some of the rules and create a limited amount of player interaction, and markets at which you can trade one or two goods for some other good.  I think what I enjoy most about the game is that it is almost a puzzle which you are trying to solve - and it is very much about how to optimize what you make and how/when to convert your money into VPs.  

This game works very well as a solo game - largely due to the puzzle aspect.  I'm not sure how long this works until it gets repetitive - but it is a great way to experiment and try different strategies.

After further reflection, this game is likely best as a solo game and solid as a two player game. Don't bother with any other number.

after playing this at boite a jeux, i had to make it mine. it was particularly difficult getting our hands on a copy since it is in between printing runs, but it was so worth making the effort to add this to our collection. it has similar farming theme to agricola, but loyang goes a step further by focusing mainly in the market selling and satisfying your customer's orders. we really love it and especially like pulling this game out when we want something light enough to play on a weeknight but with enough depth and interesting decisions.

Less impressed with this Uwe Rosenberg game compared to his others. Each person is given their own "sandbox" in which to play and most of the game's enjoyment lies therein managing their market.

We find the game charmingly addictive.  The theme and components go a long way, but to be fair I think we enjoy cube pushers where you actually [i]do something[/i] with the cubes (we really disliked the arbitrary and abstract cube-pushing in [thing=24480][/thing] for that reason).  The planting, harvesting, and trading are just enough actions and theme for us.  The game has more interactivity than I think most people give it credit for---after just several games, we started watching each other during the card distribution phase.  And that doesn't count a well-timed Trader or Marketwoman that can devastate your opponent.  It's definitely a tactical optimization game, but after starting to learn the cards more, we're starting to be able to develop some longer term strategy.  On the surface, there is less tension than Agricola since there's no constant pressure of feeding your family.  But to play well, you have to create your own tension---you have to balance your tempo between the number of hungry customers and building up your farming engine, and going too far in one direction or another can leave you behind.  It's actually a deceptively tight game and a mistake in the beginning can cost you later on.

On the surface, it's somewhat like a deeper [thing=12002][/thing].  We do miss Jambo's richer, more diverse card set and I wish there were more cards here.  However, one of the things that Jambo lacks is that sense of building something.  [thing=39683][/thing] has that feeling of starting from nothing and building up a successful vegetable market.  By the time of the mid game, your engine should be set up and pouring out vegetables.  The end game does feel a little long, but it's just added pressure to keep adding fuel to your engine to keep it running.

It's hard to dislike a game that involves farming radishes. Typically, I play this game solo.  And it is a very satisfying solo game.  I've also played with two and three players and enjoy it equally.  The card drafting in the multiplayer is confusing at first, but goes quickly once you get the hang of it. Like all good Uwe Rosenberg games, the mechanics are straight forward and the complexity comes from the cards. The large deck of cards allows a different set-up for each game. I can't foresee myself ever tiring of seeking my vegetables in Loyang.

Felt too mechanical and random at the same time. An exercise in optimization without much fun added. The scoring mechanism is great because it adds so much pressure, but maybe so much for what it's supposed to be a somewhat light game. Also, no end-of-game scoring really puts off my wife because it may feel impossible to catch up other player.

Brilliant 2 player game. Wife and I love it, good for a slightly meaty game. The interaction of the cards and the deck reset make each round a fresh challenge. I always feel like I need more time, but hey, what did you expect from Uwe?

RATING: 9
I can certainly see the core of Agricola and Le Havre here. It's got a hint of interaction in the helper cards as well as in the turn order mechanism. 

What you mainly have is Antiquity distilled down to it's essence. While it might be perceived to be too long for what it is, I actually quite like it's similarity to the latter, while appreciating it's differences, which are more like the designer's other work.

There's quite a bit to learn, but it remains simpler and shorter than the rest of the trilogy.

It's the first design, but I'm glad it was released last, and further I'm happy that there promises more to come from this blossoming designer.

Part of Uwe Rosenberg's Harvest Trilogy.  "Agricola-Lite":  has a bit more randomness, requires a little more tactical decision making, and relies less on long-term planning.  While I prefer Agricola for its depth, "Loyang" offers a pleasant economic-type agricultural gaming experience.  The card phase draft-like mechanic is interesting, but can also really hurt some players if the cards they need just never come out.  The card phase also feels a little like "press your luck", as it is better to wait as long as possible in order to get the card you need, but at the expense of receiving a poorer spot in turn order.  TTFN

RATING: 9
Rating only for solo play, which is very well implemented with the use of a grid of cards and a small area of "dummy player" customers and stalls.

After a few plays I really enjoy this one - a clever game with a puzzly feel and (seemingly) the right amount of challenge. Very simple rules, but nevertheless a very "brainy" game. It's a bit light on theme, but colorful graphics and wooden veggies give it just enough flavor to not feel overly dry.

EDIT: As I play more, I like it even more. Amazing game.

A much better game than its rating on the geek indicates.  The best part of this game is the card mechanic of playing to the courtyard and getting to play a card from the courtyard and your hand.  It has the same harvest mechanic as Agricola but is very "puzzley".  I would put Agricola and Le Havre ahead of this but only slightly.  This is a great 2 and 3 player game.

Even though there is not a lot of interaction, we do find that we are aware of what the other is doing and careful not to feed them a card they need - and careful not to get caught by one of the few interactive cards that there are.

Usually all players end at 17, 18 or 19 points, which can seem like its too close and samy-same every game. But remember that leftover coins count too, so your score is actually 18+X coins, like a decimal. And scoring 18+17 is a hell of a lot better than scoring 18+0.

The rules describe leftover coins as a tiebreaker, but its much more satisfying to disregard that, and read them into your score like above.

Apart from that, I like it a lot - I am after all a big fan of plowing fields in Agricola.
Also worth mentioning is the special "designers explanation of the rules" included - its a great way for experienced gamers to get into the game.

RATING: 8
Rating based on solo play only - I recently revisited Loyang, and was reminded how much I love the puzzle element and how you are forced to balance getting your vegetable engine going as efficiently as possible, and yet it means nothing if you don't put some of that hard earned efficiency towards your 'Path of Prosperity'. And that path is where the game comes to life for me, especially for solo play. You are trying to beat your previous score, but it means more than that. Points earned represent your business savvy and ultimate prestige and success within this bustling trading hub. It's hard work the vegetable business and it is reflected in not rewarding players with a squillion meaningless 'points' at the end of the game. 

That said, it's also refreshing to play a Rosenberg game that doesn't allow you to end the game with a negative score (I can handle it with the simple Patchwork, but it's hard to stomach with the punishing Agricola). I've never played it multiplayer but my instinct is that it shines solo; downtime could be an issue with others, and it's nice to avoid having to go through the, what seems, slightly unintuitive Distribution Phase, in place of a satisfying Grid alternative.

One and only blemish - I can see that the dummy player is functional but a little static and doesn't really replace a real person. There is an element of 'messing your opponents' plans up' in multiplayer that is missing in solo by stealing veg from their / your markets. 

The artwork is colourful and lovely to look at, and of course the wooden veggy-meeples are awesome! 

To broadly compare it to the other two early Rosenberg 'Harvest' games I would say Le Havre feels somewhat on-rails with the end game degenerating into a rush for the Shipping Line, Agricola feels punitive in the extreme (and a little like dumping a pile of hundreds-and-thousands all over your very bland bowl of pasta) and neither provide a solo experience that rivals Loyang.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a solid game, but it's far from Uwe Rosenberg's best. I find the game to be very tactical, with an emphasis on making good decisions from turn to turn, rather than working on an overall strategy. The game is a bit fiddly with many (albeit attractive) pieces. Perhaps the biggest downside to this game is turn length. In other games from this designer (Agricola, Le Havre) the player makes a single decision/action, and then the next player has a turn; in Loyang, each turn can potentially involve a dozen actions, which can induce analysis paralysis in even the most unthinking players. All that having been said, I do enjoy this game, and would gladly play it, though to someone not already familiar with Rosenberg's games, I'd recommend Le Havre or Agricola first.

Juego para 2, con un gran diseño gráfico  y piezas en madera. El juego se basa en tomar cartas e ir llenando los requerimientos de los compradores. Para ello se tiene que ir tomando decisiones acertadas a la hora de abastecerse, ya que los recursos al pasar las rondas se van agotando y los requerimientos de los mercaderes se van acumulando. Tiene algo  estrategia un poco de suerte y una pizca estress. Con un final reñido. Solo al final después de contarse los puntos se puede establecer un vencedor. (Para mi este juego me trae a la mente, Agrícola.)

My first (and probably only) foray into the depths of vegetable trading was a four-player game, and it was surprisingly unfun. My general impression is that the original stuff works nicely, but is wrapped into an overly complex whole. I like how the dependable income from your regular customers is leavened by the need to fulfill their demands, and I love how the one-time shoppers are balanced by comparing their number to the regulars. I also like the trading phase and the opportunities it offers: smuggling a card that's more valuable for you than for others onto the market can be as satisfying as seeding the table with a valuable card to entice your opponents to exit early on.

However, the gameplay apart from the market phase is purely tactical, and mostly solitaire to boot. There is no satisfying narrative arc; you do the same optimisation puzzle every round, with a peak of vegetable income towards the late middle of the game. While this is probably a more honest depiction of the farming life than the steep progress in Agricola, one usually plays games as a respite from the daily drudgery, not as a repeat performance.

Furthermore, both multi-player options seem inherently flawed: I can't imagine the tedium of waiting for two other players in the three-player game, and the four-player game makes the inexcusably sloppy mistake of only giving three options for starting vegetables, arbitrarily putting two players in a worse spot for the market phase right from the start.

In summary, my rating of 6 might still be too charitable - I'll definitely never ever play this again with three or four, and I've got far too many wonderful other games for two players to make a Loyang duel a likely option.

Another terrific game from one of the best board game designers of all time.  The game just flows while the different mechanics seamlessly blend together. He proves once again that any theme (farming in ancient China) can be made into a game.

Like many of Uwe's games, this has a built in solo mode, and it is one of the most well regarded solos around for a reason. It has its own rules and presents a unique challenge for each game. A must for any solo gamer's library.

This is my favourite solo game without a doubt. Viticulture with some Tusany elements is coming up a close second. 

I have never played a non solo game of this and am trying to work on a friend slowly so they give it a try ... hopefully they are not reading this!

Solo it is just a great peaceful puzzle that slowly develops in front of you. It is only after a couple of rounds that you start kicking yourself for planting the wrong vegetables in the wrong field a few seasons ago ... I mean how many other games can give you that feeling! Ok I will rephrase that. How many other non Uwe Rosenburg games can give you that feeling!

I managed 17 with 3 coins left over, which I thought was ok. I can't remember ever making it to 18 in the solo game, but there again I think the scores tend to be a bit lower as you have to pay for your cards in the card distribution phase (you don't have to pay in the multi-player game) and you need money to buy your way up the scoring track.

I think this is an overlooked gem of a game, try it and let me know if you see things differently.

At the Gates of Loyang is easy to play, but can be difficult to manage. First of all it is difficult in the first rounds of the game to build up your economy. The risk is that you take to much regular costumers or buy to many fields and then you run into debts and have to take a loan. The second difficulty is that due to the fact that your fields get exhausted after a while it is important to keep up buying field and sowing, otherwise your economy cools down and your income is shrinking.
This altogether makes it for me a good, but also a bit of a stressful game.

Awesome 2p euro. One of the best components I've seen and nice artwork. It's the most accessible Uwe farming game. It doesn't have as much 'story' as Agricola, but enough - it's not yet another point salad - and the components look great. The cards get old pretty quick, but they add enough randomness to avoid mathing it out, and it's still very replayable as you can always try to improve your score. I've played this 10 times but my scores are still pretty bad. We do our turns simultaneously unless there's a specific card, then we deal with that in player order and continue. This way 2p games take about 45 minutes.

Based on solo play:

Nice puzzle/optimisation game. There seems to be some luck of the draw. But the combination of buying a 2-pack, moving on the prosperity track and when what to take from the card display is very challenging and seems to mitigate the luck.

Taking more than 1 loan is discouraged in the rules: I agree.

Aligning the theme of the market stall to turned based combo play is a subtle but brilliant move.  In Agric the game supports the mentality of "grow, expand, move ahead" with its dependance on actions as the primary resource.  Loyang on the other hand presents "opportunity" as its primary resource and by doing so shifts the mentality to "capitalize" where players are constantly looking for ways to leverage opportunity, either for direct gain or to set up increased opportunity in future turns.  Just like Agric, the game builds to a fever as the players are urged to take on more and more, again here in the form of opportunity, making those final turns tense, draining, but ultimately rewarding and beautiful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyed it.  It was lighter than Agricola and Le Havre, but still with interesting decisions to be made.  Some randomness and luck with the card draw, but this isn't overwhelming.  You can mitigate the luck by deciding when to take cards, which cards to play, etc.  

I think I like this game exclusively as a 2-player game. 

My games have been very close.  

Much more casual, relaxing experience than Le Havre or Agricola, but still interesting.

I like this game; it's certainly not my favorite, but I do enjoy playing it. I bought it mainly as a solo game, but I've enjoyed playing it with 2 players as well. However, 3 players had WAY too much downtime, and 4 players had a little too much to be fun for me. But 2 players felt just about right. There isn't much player-interaction, but I really like the puzzle-solving aspect of the game, which is what makes it such a great solo game. I initially passed on buying this game, but I'm glad I ended up giving it a chance.

I did enjoy playing Loyang, but the obvious comparison to Agric/Havre is always looming. Those are two of my favorites, so I had high expectations for Loyang. I thought that it was definitely fun to gather veggies and figure out how I was going to supply my customers. And I liked the few cards that allowed you to have some kind of interaction with your partners market. Overall though I don't think it can live up to the 2 big dogs in the trilogy. I would definitely play again if asked, but this might not be one I will buy.

I was introduced to this tonight by a gaming buddy, and I was expecting something along the lines of Jambo when he pulled it out. But as the rules were explained, it got more and more complex, and then it dawned on me that we weren't playing a simple family game. Only later was it mentioned that the designer was Uwe Rosenberg. Doh! Now it all made sense... The game has gorgeous bits and pieces that really add to the theme. The decisions each round were quite difficult. And there was subtle tension whenever you got a customer in your play area that needed feeding. The game was fun to play, but I can see it going very long with more than 2. Since the game isn't really that interactive, it probably doesn't need more anyway.

Thanks, Secret Soloist!

02-Jul-2015:  In Loyang, you are growing, selling, buying, and trading produce (vegetables).  The solo game is all about the balance between efficiency and long term planning.  There is a tableau of cards from which the player may purchase customers, helpers, and/or new fields.  This is the heart of the solo game as the market will change each round bringing in new opportunities for the player to succeed in his plans.

The game is ultimately a high score affair, which turns many solo gamers off.  However, in Loyang, every VP is a struggle, an achievement.  At the end of your turn, you may pay one coin to move ahead one space on the VP track.  If you want to continue moving on the track that same turn, you must pay for that space in the same number of coins as VPs.  It's ingenious.  And brutal.  And frustrating.  And so satisfying when you can reach those higher 17 and 18 point levels.

The components are lovely in this one as well.  All of the vegetables are brightly colored, appropriately shaped wood pieces.  The cards are decent quality with nice artwork.  The overall presentation is very nice.  I did have trouble grasping the game from reading the rulebook, but after watching a video or two, I was good to go.  I don't think the rulebook is bad, it just doesn't convey what's happening on the table as clearly as I think it should.

Either way, an excellent addition to my solo game collection.  It's one I want to bring out more often in the near future.  Great stuff.

At the Gates of Loyang has many unique ideas. I really like how the scoring works but fear that it may be very difficult to catch up if you're behind. It's already a heavy tactical game with only a bit of interaction so in some cases players will just be trying to beat their own scores, like in a golf match. 

I've only played this against opponents online and it's very mathy. I fear that in person all of the calculations would just bore the heck out of players awaiting there turn. Decisions are challenging as every dollar counts. It's not a loosey goosey at all. Extra money is particularly difficult to come by since one needs more each round in order to move up the VP track.

Emphasis on vegetable growth and "trading" (i.e. resource conversion) in this game, one of Uwe's harvest trilogy.  Not nearly as economic as Le Havre or as tight as Agricola, but there's enjoyment to be had.  The various power cards can drastically change the nature of the game (a la random improvements/roles in the 'gric), but that's part of the game.  Lots of interwoven mechanics to make Euro gamers happy, and the artwork integration is right up to snuff with the other ones!

Two hours with two player. Long game with weird rules, but on paper interesting mechanics. For a relative long 2 player game it lacks interesting strategic choices. The card draw can screw you badly which bothers me in a game this long. Almost no interaction, but some cards can really mess the other player up. The game is too long and in my opinion the designer tried to fix this broken game with a bunch of weird fiddely rules. After two plays I traded it away. Great components though...

After a solo play, I found the rules a bit confusing. Particularly because it says "play" a card but means place a card in your play area (not necessarily activate/use the card) which is confusing for the helpers in particular.

I can see the potential and look forward to trying the game with my wife, whenever there's time...

Did try it, we both enjoyed it. I think this will remain a 2-player game though.

My wife's favorite game of the harvest trilogy. It's my least favorite, but that's not a bad thing as I adore Le Havre and Agricola. It feels lighter and less pressured than those games due to the lack of an upkeep (harvest food requirements.) Excellent game.

I'm finding that I have a very strong game in the middle rounds, but inevitably run out of steam late, while my wife finishes strong. 

I feel like Loyang may finally be played out for me after 24 plays. There's not enough variation from game to game.

Loyang is related to but much different than Le Havre and Agricola. It is not as tense or agonizing. Indeed, it is actually relaxing to play as you puzzle through the various combinations and equivalencies of the trading options. The card play keeps the game moving seamlessly. You always have something to think about and there is no down time. The colorful components are pleasing and beckoning.

I have only played this 2 player and I find it thoughtful and calculating without being brain-busting or thick. Yet it requires careful thought and planning, and some subtle strategy as you maximize your options. 

Wonderful game and great for 2.

Loyang is interesting, but quite unforgiving.  I like it best with 4 because there's more happening in the courtyard.  Also, the team-play rules mean that a 4-player game will finish about as quickly as a 2 player game.  The macro-turns are an interesting change-of-pace today where most other euros are designed with micro-turns.

RATING: 6.75
The vegemeeples are fantastic!  Additionally, the variety of cards improve replayability.  

What I don't enjoy is that the game often feels 'puzzley' to me.  That is, given the information available during any particular turn, one can usually optimize their moves if they spend enough time thinking about it.  This can make the game prone to AP.  I feel like I just want to build an optimization model to do it for me.

I still enjoy the game.  It's just that puzzley factor removes some of the 'wow' for me.

What can I say? ... It's another Uwe Rosenberg masterpiece. I love his games! This game is fun and it grows more exciting the later one goes in the rounds. The sowing and harvesting is fun, the game plays well solo, and the components are gorgeous. As good as this game is, its complexity will push it out of reach for some people.

My favorite Uwe Rosenburg design to date. The game starts off a little tense as you try to get your engine off the ground, but it becomes more and more of a relaxing, procedural experience as the game goes along. The game has such a nice ebb and flow to it. It's almost relaxing and a little brain-burning at the same time, which is a notable achievement of this game. Some of the wording on the cards is a little awkward, and the game doesn't reward much in the way of variation, but I really enjoy my plays of this game. Even if it does have that quirky Rosenburg feel to it, where the game feels a little scatter-brained on what your focus should be.

RATING: 6
I' not sure that At the gates of Loyang is a solid design. Is more of the same. The game is slow, with plenty of luck in the cards, a lot of downtime, and most of all is almost a solo game. Is boring. 
I think that it has not much replayability. I had the feeling that the cards system was introduced only to give the players some interaction, and the 4 players play system was a last time change to reduce the downtime.
This is the less emphatic game of the triology.
At the beginning I didn't have a good felling about the game, and last night its proved that I was right. I didn't dislike the game, but is way to long for what that it offers. I don't mind to play it again, but I won't recommended it.

Would like to play this much more. Very different to Agricola - the harvesting mechanism is similar but that is all.

Fun game to play, but I'm also partial to any game by Rosenberg. I personally like games with more to do, but this game is still well crafted and solid. It has a unique aspect and takes a lot of thought.  I enjoy the strategic aspect of this game. The set-up is simple enough. I have not played solo, but have heard great things about it. The length of the game is a turn-off considering what goes on in the game.

EDIT 2015-05-31: Note de 7.2 (mai 2013) revue à la baisse. Aucune envie d'y jouer. Trop procédural, trop influencé par le hasard des cartes accessibles et obtenues via les "two-pack". Le jeu semble nous jouer, et je ressens plus de stress et de maux de tête que de plaisir en y jouant.


**

À deux joueurs, un certain élément "chance" dans l'obtention de cartes clés peut altérer la suite du jeu. 

Sur une note plus positive, j'apprécie particulièrement la mécanique de draft (Card phase) qui se répète neuf fois durant la partie (tout le contraire d'Agricola!). Nous sommes constamment confrontés à des dilemmes, et il faut savoir planifier et bien lire le jeu pour y connaître du succès. 

Techniquement, la phase d'actions laisse aux joueurs une très grande liberté, mais, bien souvent, l'environnement austère dans lequel oeuvrent les joueurs condamne ces derniers à exécuter ce qui peut et doit être exécuté.

Un jeu où il faut donc maximiser la rentabilité de chaque décision. Très calculatoire, peut-être trop à mon goût.

À mon goût, je préfère ce jeu à Agricola, mais je sais qu'il sera un jour dans ma liste de jeux à échanger.

Note: Le matériel est agréable à manipuler, mais peut faire perdre beaucoup de temps. Aidez vos adversaires pour économiser du temps, et laissez-les vous aider à votre tour!

RATING: 7
Thoughts after a 3 player game and 3 solo plays: Enjoyable, but nowhere as good as Agricola or Le Havre. The helpers add just enough interaction to keep it from being completely multiplayer solitaire and I do like these kind of efficiency puzzles. But having slow or AP prone players makes this almost unbearable and what is the deal with the scoring system?

RATING: 7
This game completes the 'harvest trilogy', but was designed before Agricola. In ancient China, in the card phase, one has to choose which card to keep and which one to make available to opponents. Then during the action phase, you plant vegetables, then sells them to customers, buy a 2 pack of cards, play helpers, buy vegetables, etc. You are trying to make the most money so you can advance on the path of prosperity. The first step always cost you $1, but the next steps cost the value.

This game works well with 2 players and clocks in at two hours or so. Unfortunately, with more players, it takes a very long time and bogs down. I would only play this with 2 players, and it is a good fun game, with tactics and trying to improvise. What prevents this from being a top tier game is some of the helpers can interfere with your opponents, and you have to wait for your opponent during their action phase. Having said that, I do enjoy this game, and the implementation on yucata.de is fun.

One of Rosenbergs best games that I have played. I really like this game, but I like agricola more ;D. Nothing matter, this growing and selling game is a very good strategie game. AtgoL bear comparison with other econimcal stratgie games in the top 20 of BGG, where are many games of this cathegory. To play this game is a good alternative to other games but it be high in price.


Update: Finaly its not so good as I've think first. rating down.

RATING: 6
Clearly a close relative of Agricola, keeping the emphasis on resource management while downplaying the satisfying card combos and largely doing away with the tense worker placement.  Not bad, but the shorter duration is quite frankly the only reason to play this instead of Agricola.

Painfully slow the first time; much better the second time, but still a bit fiddly, and hard to work out any kind of strategy; good solitaire game the third time.

On fourth play, it all started to fall into place - I managed to get up to 17 points, and began to see how you might get all the way to 20... On fifth play, again I got to 17; now I really want to try to get to 20.

After some initial rules problems, the game came together nicely and had lots of things I liked about it. More plays will be needed to see where the final rating falls. **UPDATE** Played with 2 and enjoyed it. The problem I have with the game is that the final score is almost guaranteed to be incredibly close. I'm talkin about within a point, unless one player is really terrible. The journey is interesting and enjoyable, but the destination may be lacking here.

Oh, how we love this game.  Learned it as a 4-player game.  Haven't tried it two-player yet.  Got it for 25 bucks at the FLGS and this makes it easily the best bang for the buck (outside of thrift store scores) in our collection.

A bit more random than most Rosenberg games, but whatever.  This game integrates the theme better than almost any other game we've played.

Edit:  first solo play tonight.  Fantastic!

The best thing about At The Gates Of Loyang is the variety of all the colorful wooden vegetable tokens. The game itself is complicated and turns feel too restrictive. It took only one solo play to for me to know that my friends wouldn't like the game.

Thank you Mr. Rosenberg, but I'll stick with your Bohnanza for a growing and selling crops game. It is far simpler than AtGoL and its trading is better player-to-player interaction.

RATING: 8
Played this game once with 4 and once solo.  I really enjoy it but have found it very hard to get back to the table.  It is interesting to me that this did not rise up to the top of the ranking as Agricola and Le Havre have.  It is a bit easier to grasp than the previous two, and it does seem to me that this would have been the game to come out AFTER Bohnanza.

The game is all about planting the right amount of crops so that you create an engine that is constantly satisfying different customers.  The trick is to plant at the right time with the right customers so that you never waste any crops and are always raking in the coin.

RATING: 6.5
Not quite sure what to make of this unusual puzzle game. On the plus side, it feels complete. Lots to do on each turn, and the game builds turn by turn, opening up more options, increasing income, increasing freedom of action. On the negative side, planning-luck in the early game can swing the game. Like, if you have an extra radish, and on a whim you decide to sow it, and then the next turn you happen to draw a customer who requires radishes -- it's planning, but planning for something that is a blind luck draw. Same with luck of the draw in general, as you could potentially be shut out of the lucrative regular customer market for several turns. Finally, I found it incredibly difficult to grasp the game from the rulebook, even though it was written and organized in the same style as Agricola, Le Havre, and Ora, all of which are more complex games yet have more easily grasped rules. Perhaps this game is less intuitively organic than those (i.e., it's rulesy)

I have mostly played this solitaire.

This is an enjoyable economic puzzle.  The brain burn seems a little more pure somehow than that of Le Havre and Agricola.  It is probably the simplicity - grow vegetables, trade 'em, and, more importantly, sell 'em!  This is a very nice short (hour or less) solo puzzle.  I have played this with another person once.  The interaction is subtle, much less than the other two.

This type of game causes me angst in the rating system.  It is a really smooth, well put together game.  So it should be highly rated.  However, using the BGG scale, it is not a game I would suggest playing.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I do not want to play it all the time
-> Of all the solitaire-like games, this one really does feel that way; If I have an opportunity to play someone, I will pick a more interactive game

Why I still give it an 8:
+ It is an excellently designed game
+ It is perfect for solitaire play
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Brilliant game, especially for 2 players. 

I don't agree with those who say it's a solitaire game. There's a bit of interaction, enough to spoil rival player's turns from time to time. I played some 2 player games in yucata with plenty of interaction that decided the outcome. 

The issue is: usually you can annoy one rival at the cost of a minor loss to you. In a 2 players game, the loss of your rival is your win, but in a 3-4 players game, the other players are "free riders that benefit from your confrontations; thus, the game is more prone to become a "solitaire".

Likes:
-> Plenty of choices/paths
-> Above average strategy
-> the drafting mechanism (very clever!) reduces the randomness of the cards
-> Perfect mix of interaction for me (not possible to gangbang the leader, can annoy rivals at a minor cost for you)
-> The richer doesn't get richer
-> Great components
-> Good replayability

My negative point: prone to AP.

A pretty little vegetable optimization exercise. Probably too long with more than two players. The card drafting system is truly brilliant.

The few interactive cards should probably have been left out completely since they contribute mainly to downtime only, and even with these cards included, the game still is mostly just solitaire bookkeeping.

Similar weight to Agricola, but more tactical. Certainly lighter and shorter than Le Havre. At the Gates of Loyang is decent game in it own right, but lacks the charm of Agricola and the strategic planning of Le Havre. Ora et Labora is also better than this.

RATING: 8
After his two hitherto biggest smashes (Bohnanza and Agricola) both dealt with veg, Uwe Rosenberg resorted again to farming for Vor den Toren von Loyang. 

Only slightly different in topic to both aforementioned games (this time it's production and sales of veggies) and more or less between them in terms of difficulty, Vor den Toren vor Loyang offers a near-solitaire gaming experience with a considerable modicum of luck (the game relies heavily on drawing cards... many of which can't be saved for later). Notwithstanding, players have lots of room to plan which veg they're going to stick to in order to build a quick and efficient production line, and also what sorts of clients (regular or occasional) they want to sell their veg to.

Even though the packaging might suggest Vor den Toren von Loyang continues the streak of heavy Rosenberg games started with Agricola, it's ultimately a different beast: a lighter, quicker, more agile kind of game that doesn't make as much impact but can be played a couple of times in a row.

Heard it called "Agricola Light" but disagree - I feel like Agricola is more intuitive. The harvesting/planting part is always satisfying to me though, as is the meeting customers' needs. I think it's the helper cards (typical text-loaded action cards) and the strange feel of the market buying/selling that puts me off a bit. I found it a bit frustrating teaching it to a new player. Could have been a better game!

[b]At the Gates of Loyang[/b] was received in a trade (4/30/14)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]I still love this game, even if it hasn't been easy to get it to the table. This seems to be the most overlooked of Uwe's big farm games and I'm not sure why. I find that it really captures the theme of running a market stall all the way from planting crops, to managing inventory and keeping customers happy. I love figuring out the logistics puzzle I am presented wit each time I play. Yo uare always presented with different challenges because you never know what customers are going to want, and it is not always easy/cheap to row the crops you need.

I want to briefly touch on the scoring track in the game which only goes to 20. While that may seem like a very constrained scoring track the tie breaker is money, which are basically additional points. Not only that, the amount of planning it takes to get your score from 16 to 17 to 18 is unbelievable. This is not an easy game, improving your score by 1 point after multiple plays felt like quite an accomplishment. I'm continually hovering at 17 with one 18 point game under my belt. I can't imagine scoring 19 or 20.

This also happens to be the first game I recently played solo. I really enjoyed it, although it is a lot to keep track of without having another player who is helping you. I plan on trying it again solo and my son will play with me again, I just wish I could find an opponent who enjoys the game as much as I do.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great theme, with beautiful production from the artwork to all the wooden vegimeeples.
- Another Uwe game that plays awesome with 2 and doesn't involve feeding anyone.
- The card drafting system is really tense because you are discarding cards to a common pool that both players can choose from. However; the twist is that you must choose a card from the common pool and your hand.
- There is something therapeutic about planting fields of vegetables and then harvesting them. It is a tense game, but somehow I stay very relaxed while playing.
- Great variety of card types (long term customers, one time customers, market stands and helpers) and character abilties on the helper cards.
- Figuring out how to optimally fulfill orders to customers while also making sure you are going to continue to harvest the vegetables you need is a great, brain burning puzzle you have to figure out each turn.

I really am impressed with this game, I can't believe a game with a 20 point score track seems to have lots of replay ability. I was initially nervous that the game could be solved, but it is impossible because you never know which cards you will get, and which order your fields come out in.

A great strategic game of running your own vegetable market! It really feels like you are running your own little business. The components are awesome and the wooden veggies are absolutely great! I really appreciate not having to pre-order this game, or buy 10 expansions of wooden bits to make this game complete also...he-hem...Agricola...

As far as some of the helper cards...the Shopper and the Official are incredibly powerful. In a 2-player game if the Official is taken early in the game, the game might be overbalanced. Also, if a player acquires both the Shopper and the Official...I don't even want to know!

I remember reading that some other gamers had said that this game was better for them than Agricola. I think I might agree with them! In Agricola I always feel like if I make a mistake in a round and pick the wrong things in the wrong order...I lose!

Got it on the tabel as a 2 player game. I've played a number of solo games, but the addition of another player adds considerably to the game.
Enjoyed it & hope to get it on the table again soon.

Second 2 player game. This time we both had a basic understanding of the rules & things flowed well.
There is an element of solitaire to the game, as is often put forward, but I think that it makes for a relaxed gaming experience. I found that once I could  confirmed that my opponent wasn't going to use a helper against me, it was just a case of trying to make the most of what I had. I can't see myself playing it all the time, but it is fun & I wouldn't say no to another game.

My favorite Uwe game on first try.  I think after a second play I will at least swap the ratings with Le Havre, but the sky (Agricola) is the limit.  I like the drafting of cards and the quick disposal of most of them.  It is the most fun I have had harvesting.

Edit: I really enjoy playing this game.  Had to give it a slight bump.

Edit: Brought it back down a notch.  After getting over the pretty bits and satisfying game play, feeling more and more like solitaire.

I'm a fan of low interaction games where you have decent control over your own destiny, but I'm wondering if this hugely tactical beast has too little interaction even for me. Each turn you're trying to maximise your money to advance multiple steps along the VP track. Your opportunities to make money each round will be dictated by the 2 cards you'll keep (via the novel discard / draft mechanism), plus turning the vegetables you've laid in previous turns into money this turn the best way you can, done via Jambo style demand cards. There are a bunch of "helper" cards which allow you to use other players things, but I was surprised how little that affected the play (although I'm sure some cards will cruel an opponent at times). The score track was a good feature - pay $1 for the first VP you acquire each turn, and also $x for each additional space you'd like, where x is the number of VPs you'll get to as a result of each move. It provides some interesting dilemmas in the early to mid-game where you're weighing up investing the money into your money-producing engine for later VPs vs acquiring cheap VPs now that may win you the game. The engine building / VP generating challenge was interesting in and of itself, with lots of ways to combine your actions (resulting in serious downtime at times however), and probably worth a higher rating, but I mark it down in the end due to the lack of tension induced by its solo nature, the impression it leaves that each game will play out exactly the same as the first and that your success will be dependent on whether cards come along that match your production at the times you need them.

RATING: 8
The solo game isn't as rewarding as Agricola, perhaps because the show differs from how the multi game plays, but it's still good for learning the game and getting a feel of how the cards interact.

In multiplayer this game shines and a 2P game is quite different to a 4P - in the latter you really have to watch who you choose as your partner.

Both our 4P games have run long but never felt long, I can see this game being played a lot

I played it (the prototype) at "Hominidos" (a kind of GeekCon in Catalonian-Spain organized by Homoludicus). It was more diferrent to agricola than Lehavre. Is a Good economic game. I only played four rounds but i enjoy the few time that i have with the game (it was the time to go home). I rated at the moment a 7 because i don't like the fact that someone can steal you things during the game (it can push you to bankrupt), but probably after more plays (my girlfriend has telling me that she will buy it at essen) it can be a 8 (the same rating that Lehavre (the best for me) and Agricola.

Ah! Also i have advise: don't catch too much regular buyers or they will catch all your money! (a player during the game had a lot of problems with this)

This game gets a bump up in rating for its excellent solo mode. The random card market in the solo game is a great puzzle to play with. The 2p game is also solid and Kristy and I enjoy playing it from time to time. It doesn't compete with our love for his bigger resource conversion games though.

I was afraid that this game would be too simple. I was pleased to find plenty of tough decisions. That being said, the game seemed to drag a bit while waiting for other players to carry out their actions. There wasn't enough player interaction to keep everyone engaged during the action phase. Players spend their down time planning ahead. Occasionally, someone will do something that affects the other players, only to find it slows things down because they now have to rethink their plans.

I like the game, but it may require player experience to flow quicker.

Vegetable trading instead of cubes trading! Not much new in the Land of the Rising Sun (somehow as this plays in ancient China). Still the mechanics are very clever and make for a compelling game!

RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: As with Uwe's other games, there is a lot of bits and movement of resources, but other then that, it is very different. You play two cards a turn and choose another player (in a four player game) that you can interact with. You try and produce as much as possible to fill orders and then deliver them to get money. The money is used to buy points at the end of each round. Of the cards you play one comes from your hand and one from the previously discarded cards of others, so you must time your selection to get the cards you want and the partner you want. Quite original mechanics and you can see the progression, but watch out for your fields as once they are empty, you lose them. Definitely want to play again.

This game felt a lot like managing a busy restaurant: you have lots of customers with varying needs and levels of patience, but the food will only come out so fast.  It was fun trying to optimize this sort of environment.  However, the card drafting and scoring mechanisms both felt a little wonky, as as the game ramped up in later turns, downtime was a big issue (which surprisingly is worse with 3 players than 4, because the 4-player rules include simultaneous play).

I have to say that I'm still undecided on how I feel about this game. Some of it is absolutely great (the fields, providing to customers), but some of it's just okay (the card drafting, the take that and the downtime). I found the game went from meh the first couple plays to okay the more that I've played it. I'm just not sure it's ever going to go beyond just being "okay" though. I like the solo variant and it seems to be fine to break out every now and again.

I will say though that learning the differences in scoring is what's kept my attention for this long. Finding out a score of 17 and 1 coin is drastically different than 17 and 12 coins. I always found it annoying we were going to a tie breaker of money, but now I see how different the money makes the final scoring.

At the Gates of Loyang is not that similar to Agricola and Le Havre. Instead of taking mini-turns, like in the previous two games, you get only a few turns, in which you have to manipulate of your own shop and supply and your action cards, and react to the demands of your customers.. Feels a bit similar to a tactical game like Babel. Very enjoyable

A very strong game.  I like how it felt even deeper than Agricola.  There were a lot of options, paths, and it felt straight forward of what can be done.  I like the unlimited actions to take on your turn.

The game is probably pretty high on its strategy, which makes for a deeper game, however, harder to bring to the table.  Everything was fairly smooth, however didn't like the fiddly mechanism of keeping one hand and one courtyard card.  AP was noticeable in this game.  

Overall, not bad and it's still a solid game.

Impressions after 3 plays - Very interesting game, filled with tight decisions about immediate versus delayed payoffs, plenty of strategic options, and great presentation.

After one play with my wife we were both pleasantly surprised. Although the instructions are less than clear once we pushed through a couple of rounds I think we had it. 

She loves the cute vegetable pieces and the farm feel. I liked the math part of it. Every play was bout calculating what the best payoff was. I lost, so maybe that attests to my math skills, but I still like the potential.

Really great bits and interesting theme to this game, during which you sell vegetables to customers visiting your market stall. While you're mostly working on your own farm, there are special helper cards that allow you to mess up your neighbor's plans in order to get ahead.

Enjoy the solo game. It has the typical Uwe efficiency challenge but the mechanism for acquiring the helper cards is just random enough to make every game different. 

Although the card acquisition mechanism in multiplayer is also interesting, the game often moved slow and you had to trust that your opponents weren't making mistakes because it was too difficult to track their moves.

Good lord this thing comes in a giant box (why so giant?) for what is essentially a card game. It's a fun, tight card game. I wonder how much your strategy can affect your score. I assume if you play really poorly, you could end up with a very low score. However, my score always seems to end up being the same, regardless of how well or poorly I feel I played. I suspect that is an artifact of the way that you pay increasing amounts to move up the score track.

Pretty weak for a Rosenberg game.

That said, it's essentially multi-player solitaire, with some set collection, etc etc. 
Perhaps I'm holding it to standards that are much too high, but they're the ones set by Ewe himself in his previous titles, so there's that.

Anyway. It's alright, if Agricola is too "starvy" for you, or Le Havre is too "abundant".

I really love the individual playing boards and the way this games flows and ties together. Although not my favorite game, I'll still play this almost any time someone asks. It has a very different style of play, in that the most important thing is a good plan/strategy that has to flow from turn to turn. What you plant now has to produce everything you need for several turns, but the market stalls can help you if you just need one of something, but timing is so important to get things planted so you can harvest them when you need them. It's so hard to explain how this game flows, but when you play it, it is so engrossing and because of the staff (people cards) - you have to constantly be aware of what other players have and what they are doing, so you can save what you need and gain from other players when you have a good staff card. Very involving game that never plays the same way twice.

RATING: 8.5
Good two player game. There is a bit of downtime, but then again, this note is just after the first game. The components are great. The rules could also use extra examples, particularly on the card draw section. Other than that, the game plays good, and even though it does not seem so, you will reach close to the 20 points in the success track.

RATING: 5
I was absolutely enamored with this at first.  However after about a dozen plays (a mix of solo and two player), its charm has been exhausted.

The tension is still there every game, but it's the same tension every time.  Waiting for the right cards to come up before planting is a losing strategy, so you're left with planting and hoping to get your hands on the cards that would make use of it.

I do think the card draft is fascinating and I will happily play should the opportunity arise.  I just don't feel the need to own it any more.

I feel this is one of the rare number crunching exercises that is enjoyable due to the immersive theme and the motivation to push the scoring marker up, so worth it just for the mental exercise. 

However, because of the effort to eke out as much profit as possible, I find this lowers my tolerance of the helpers who interfere with the planning: this means I'll be very reluctant to play with 2 or more players because of AP, bloated turns and the 'take that' nature of the helpers.

[b]Comment:[/b] Solid Uwe resource management game. You run a farm and a vegetable stand and need to sell specific combinations of vegetables to different customers. You can see some Agricola in it but it's is pretty different and stands on it's own well. The different vegetable meeples are really cute. Everything in the game is built on a card distribution mechanic, where each player gets a few cards in their hand, and they either add a card to the central pool, or take a card from the pool and one from their hand and put the rest into the pool for other players. You need to pay attention to what other people need and try not to feed them. It adds a nice card drafty tension.

First impression is that it's clearly not the best of the three Uwe Rosenberg game published so far (other: Agricola and Le Havre). The material is super with all those little wood vegetables. The helpers doesn't seem to be bringning much to the game. The card round is a little bit desorienting as when you have a good hand and would like to keep the card your not allowed to. You have to put a good card on the table and if you're lucky and it's still there when you turn comes back to pick it up  and secure you hand.When you have a shitty hand receinving cood card from another player is more fun.
Will have to play it again.

Première impression c'est que ce n'est définitivement pas le jeu le plus intéressant des trois jeux que nous propose Uwe Rosenberg jusqu'à présent (autres: Agricola and Le Havre). Le matériel est superbe avec ces petits légumes en bois. Les ''helpers'' n'apportent pas grand chose à la partie. La phase de cartes est désorientante car lorsque vous avez une bonne main, vous êtes obligé de discarter une bonne carte, et sous vous êtes chanceux, elle sera toujours là lors de votre tour pour la reprendre et sécuriser votre main de cartes. Lorsque vous avez une mauvaise main, il est toujours plaisant de voir apparaître de bonne cartes que vous pouvez ramasser pour ajouter à votre main.
Je vais devoir y rejouer pour confirmer ma note.

It's ok but not exciting for me. Seems to take too long for what it is. I've never been happy with the scoring system, and in the games I've played no one ever dared take a loan, so they might as well not be there. I like the idea of selecting cards in the distribution round, but with two players there's not enough options, and this aspect of the game I find is not as interesting as getting cards in Inotaizu.

I like Uwe Rosenburg games (well the 'trilogy', to me there steeped in a mind blowing array of options and richly themed. I love them ) Considering its downtime issues, this one looks like a fab two player game. On order
UPDATE I like this game, luckily I managed to get a cheap copy because this is poor value for money.
Having just got it have only played solo which is quite engaging, if not careful the action phase of the game might take a too long for some people to complete, so I think you would need the right players for this. 
I like the fact that Uwe's games can be played solo but this game it sort of feels like solo game adjusted to be played multiplayer because of the action phase.
UPDATE never multiplayered on this one but as a solo game this is quite addictive..

Uwe acertou em cheio neste! Jogo cheio de malandragens, o cuidado com as cartas na seleção é muito importante, e tem seu toque de blefe. Decidir o que plantar, sem saber exatamente quando aqueles cliente irão aparecer é um investimento interessante que exige uma boa leitura do jogo.
A interação entre os jogadores através do helpers é ótima, e pode ser bastante agressiva em alguns momentos.
O controle do dinheiro também é crucial, quando você percebe que faltou um dinheirinho para subir mais uma posição na pontuação!

Ah, que jogo ótimo!!

At The Gates of Loyang (or simply "Gates" as we refer to it) is another lovely agricultural economic in Uwe Rosenburg's rather large catalogue of agricultural economics. It is a tight game of raising various vegetables (represented by those chunky, charming vegimeeples) and satisfying your customers. Along the way you'll hire helpers and contract suppliers with which you can trade vegetables you have for the one you need.

Likely one of the most unique (and also my least favorite) mechanic is the scoring mechanism. Every turn you can pay one "cash" (the game's currency) to advance one spot on the track, regardless of where you are on it. Then, you may pay the amount that the subsequent space(s) are worth to continue advancing until you run out of cash or choose to stop. (For example, you begin your turn on number nine on the score track. You may pay one cash to advance to 10 on the score track. If you wish to advance to 11 that turn you must pay 11 cash, and then pay 12 more if you wish to advance again).

That minor caveat aside Gates is an outstanding game that I would highly recommend to fans of Uwe's designs, nice components, and quirky themes. Also of note most people seem to think three is the best player count for this and that may be, but Gates plays great with two.

Loyang was not what I was expecting.  It's a card game.  (Who could tell from the gigantic box?)  Since I like card games, I actually like Loyang.  The thing that stood out for me was the way that the theme really seemed reflected in the mechanics.  While there was a lot of rearranging of bits which made it seem fiddly, the moving around of stuff made me feel like I was doing a lot of trading and running around--even if I was only trading stuff within my own play area.

But with four players, it's annoying. I still am not sure if we were supposed to be doing everything simultaneously or not during the pick a partner phase.  Plus, in almost all situations, it didn't really matter who my partner was.

But I liked it.  The card and hand management was all there. The veggie bits were adorable.  It's a solid two  player game--one that I wouldn't be sorry to play again.

This is probably my favorite Rosenberg game so far. I like the flow of the game phases better here than Agricola. The game can be a little fiddly with a ton of moving parts, quickly filling the table with cards. There's a lot to consider each turn which can result in some serious downtime.
I think the card drafting phase really shines here, where there were many times I felt in control of who would become first player for actions (an often important position to be in!)
Most actions are meaningful and result in a tight race for VP. Many different paths to victory. I like the "two-pack" action, but feel it adds some unnecessary luck to the game.
Overall: A very solid game all about balance. Playing it safe will leave you left behind but taking chances can leave you very sore. Looking forward to looking at this one from more angles.

RATING: 7
Very enjoyable. Similar to Agricola but without the worker placement and urgent need to feed, and thus with less tension. Those elements are replaced by others that offer different kinds of interaction, but player interaction is still at a fairly low level. Not as heavy as Agricola, but still with plenty of important decisions to make every round.

At the Gates of Loyang is a very typical Rosenberg game. You start with almost nothing and then produce and convert resources (vegetables). AtGoL is also more straight-forward than the other Rosenberg Games. Instead of building buildings and producing all kind of other goods or feed your family as side job, here you focus just on growing and selling vegetables (which then roughly equates to victory points). I really like the concept of permanent costumers, which give you kind of the same feeling as feeding your family in Agricola (but as mentioned is not a "side quest"). Playing with vegemeeples makes running the game more easily (compared to chits in O&L) and increases the appeal of the game. 
Initial Rating: 7

[i]Update[/i]: On second play the extreme multiplayer-solitaire nature of the game became really apparent. Because of the almost absent interaction AtGoL is more puzzle than game (much more than other Rosenberg titles). Rating decreased to 6.5

Plays very well with two. Sow and harvest vegetables, and select and use action cards to serve regular and casual customers for cash. Interesting card selection mechanism (one from the courtyard and one from your hand) and scoring (first step costs 1, each subsequent step costs the number on the step). Seems like replayability will be great with all the action cards, which add abilities, opportunities, and twists (trading at market stalls, buying goods, stealing goods, buying fields, gaining customers). Gorgeous artwork and solid mechanics make a tight, fun game. Loans can easily lose you the game.

I asked for this game for Christmas 2013, thinking it sounded like a great game for 2p sessions with my wife (we both like several of Uwe's other games, and like both card games and heavy resource-manipulation euros). It hasn't had quite the effect I intended, as we've only played it twice since, with future plays not seeming particularly likely soon. It's not that we don't like the game - I think it's pretty good, and my wife, while I think a bit underwhelmed, certainly doesn't dislike it. But with so many other games out there, including good 2p games (I know this plays 3 and 4 as well, but I have no intention of trying it at these numbers, due to the explanation required and the large increase in downtime), this is no longer that near the top of my list of games to suggest. The long playtime (our games were taking upwards of 2 hours, at least the first game did) is another factor against it.

Still a good game though, and one I would like to play more if I had the chance.

I didn't think I was going to get into this one after the first few reviews I read, but Cass ordered a copy and I soon found myself wanting to play it more and more.

It has a surprising amount of replay value. The various helper cards make each game different from the rest. When in the game the helpers come out greatly affect how useful they are and it's been fun learning this.

Have only played it once with more than two players and would love to do try three and four player games

Boy do I love this game. Its flow attests to its excellent design (and designer!). You have to be a really good planner, and look at all your options to succeed in this one. The regular customers who demand veggies turn after turn are by far the most lucrative way to play, so you need to get a steady flow of produce coming in as soon as possible to maximize your prosperity. 

If you're a patient, cognitive gamer (the Agricola type), buy this game.

Like Agricola and La Havre, it's a fiddly production engine type game, but shorter and easier to grok than La Havre and more interesting/appealing (IMHO) than Agricola. It's got a kind of addictive "I can do it more efficiently next time" appeal: we played it 3 times in one day (2-player) after borrowing it from friends. Cute wooden veggies. But perhaps too much luck of the draw...?

2010-12-26: I've realized I'm not so into these kinds of fiddly games with tons of different cards with unique effects all in play at the same time. Complexity from a complex system with lots of stuff is less interesting to me than complexity from a simple elegant system that has deep consequences.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Have very much enjoyed my couple of plays and want to continue to explore in 2018. Loyang has what I might call a 'sharp sloppy' design, meaning that there's continual randomness to be handled which can provide uneven opportunities (that's the sloppy), but constant opportunity & necessity for the player to handle and ride whatever providence hands them in order to compensate correctly. The semi-random opportunities arrive on a conveyor belt which makes multiple passes throughout the game, so it seems perfectly reasonable to me so far that the balance may be tuned to a fine degree. Time will tell. Regardless: no question that I've enjoyed this one so far. I just have to watch out for its AP-inducing nature, because much like its other cousins by Uwe, each turn is potentially fully calculable.

This is standard fare for Use Rosenberg games.  You are a first century Chinese farmers trying to sell your vegetables to make money ,so you can buy victory points. You do this by playing cards from a pool that the players supply from their hand. The cards give you customers to sell to or helpers with your fields. This is almost entirely a card game but the wooden vegetable bits make this game what it is. It is fun and I do enjoy playing it, 

pros:  fun farming mechanisms, great components, fun theme,deep strategy

Cons:large rule changes based on the number of players, maximum 4 player game. Confusing turn orders, fiddly rules,can be prone to long stalls with indecisive players.

--Dec2009-- I'm pretty enthusiastic about this one after one play.  It was much more engaging (for me) than my first play of _Hansa Teutonica_.  I like the simplified-_Antiquity_ mechanics; the modest interplayer screwage; the randomness of the card draw; the tight economy.  Is it better than _Agricola_ or _Le Havre_?  Probably not:  but I rank both of those a 9, and this might reach that level.

This was a total bust for me.  While I like some of the mechanics of the cards, the whole thing is a boring trek through the vegetable gardens.  This is a tired theme and by attaching it to games with interesting mechanics I feel the publishers hedge themselves off from any real hope of a compelling experience in a 90 minute game.

I think the scoring in this one may be the worst I've seen in a while..  as there is functionally no way to catch someone in the lead.

I also think that it's wrong, or maybe just asinine to charge this amount for a card game.  Shame on them and shame on me for taking the bait.  

I won't play this again.

Another solid game by Uwe. I don't enjoy this one quite as much as Le Havre, but it is probably going to hit the table more just because its easier to play.

Glad to see Uwe Rosenberg, one of my favorite designers, made a game in ancient Chinese background. Each player runs an inn at capital Luoyang. They grow their own crops, hire helpers, and serve their customers. Money is the key to winning (capitalism? That's UNCHINA!). The maths in this game is delibrately designed, making it a good solitaire puzzle. The mechanics are new and intriguing, and do not look like any other games.

Rating after 1 play. 

Not sure what to think about this game  yet, although I did have a good time while playing it. It was a two player game with my gf, although it's basically multiplayer solitaire so I doubt if adding players would really make a big dif.  

There are 3 phases to the game, in the first one you simply take one good of each field you have and then draw a new field. The next phase is the card phase, in which you get 4 new cards, but can only keep 2. Sorta. This phase seemed unnecessarily complicated. Why could't we just draw 4 cards in the beginning and 2 each in all the following phases? Why all the complicated, game lengthening bs? Why Uwe, why?! Anyways, the card phase as it is turned me off each round, resulting in me not really wanting to continue. But once it was over and we moved on I started enjoying myself again. The next phase is when you do stuff. There is a list of actions you can take, any number of times and in any order, except 1 can only be done once. Kinda like Reef Encounter. Except in this game you are trading goods, mostly with "Market Stall" cards that you drew (or acquired) in the card phase, and then delivering them to "Customer" cards that you got in the card phase. This can make for some pretty sweet combos and a nice satisfying smugness for pulling off something widely complex.  At the end of the round each player buys VP's.

I'll be giving this one another shot for sure, as it's thinkyness level is just about right for me, but the card draw may give it a level of randomness that just isn't acceptable in this kind of game. Time will tell!

RATING: 5
A good economic engine and logistics game that will probably play more or less the same with each outing once you've solved the basics. That's not a terrible thing because it's the fun bit discovering what works and what works better. It's more tactics than strategy. While it doesn't have the depth of Le Havre, of the trilogy games it's the easiest to pick up and decent to pull out once in a while.

One negative issue with the game is the downtime caused by the not overly significant player interaction. The character cards often mean players must wait for others before performing their actions. If you want to get around this you can ask if another player is going to do anything to you and then play on if they're not. However, with the purchasing of new cards each turn possible you feel guilty about stuffing up the flow of things by playing a newly acquired character card. It's not a big thing, but it certainly is one reason I think this game maxes out at three players.

I do like the card selection mechanic. Mostly you're playing for turn order than any magic card appearing, but it's nice when a terrific card appears anyway. It's a cleverly simple system that works very well.

The best of Uwe's big box games, surprisingly it isn't the one that gets the best ratings. Perhaps the success of his previous designs left this game without a space in the ludic world. At the end, it is about getting resources in order to score points, as most Euros, but the game changes so much that it is not as easy as building a machine and let it work, having the players to constantly reinvent themselves instead.

This game doesn't flow as nicely as I wanted it to - the cards that add player interaction (I'm not against that) feel disruptive (action phase)- "I don't have any cards that affect you this turn. Do you? Ok, now we can do what ever we were planning simultaneously to save time".
And you want to cut out as much down time as possible because this game can get too long.

Best played with three.  The turn order mechanic is a bit clunky for four players.  More random elements than Agricola or Le Havre but much more accessible to players.  A shorter play time than its co-harvest games has meant that it hits the table more often.

[11/03/11] Finally played this with another player, and enjoyed it a lot as a 2-player game.  My mind hasn't changed though about avoiding 3-player (too much downtime) and 4-player (tacked-on rules for pairing up each turn).

This game gets a lot of solitaire play - as solo games go it's right up there with co-op games like Pandemic for me.

[17/03/10] I've only played this game solitaire, which popular opinion would strongly suggest is the best way to play it.  While Agricola and Le Havre are excellent multiplayer games with solid solitaire play thrown in, Loyang seems to be an excellent solitaire game with a multiplayer option thrown in (whether it was designed that way or not).

Despite a hefty price tag this game has been worth it for me.  I'm keen to try it with 2 players at some point, but it seems best to avoid with 3 or 4.

Fantastic game about moving wood bits around to get points.  Highly under rated on BGG. Tight game, if you fall behind early you may not catch up.  Love the card selection sub-game. Possibly my favorite Rosenberg (toss up with Le Havre). Excellent two player game.

RATING: N/A
As my friend put it after our game, Uwe seems to design solitaire exercises, then throws in a little (sometimes false) interaction with some texty cards... 

Agricola was highly interactive because each worker placement space was limited to 1 placement, and that was really a good game. I didn't play Le Havre, but it didn't look better to me - in fact, it looked worse. I'm not even sure I can identify why exactly.

Loyang is fairly obviously a solitaire game with interaction tacked on. It seems to me to be a game designed for players who play games "for fun" and don't try to win. To me that doesn't make sense - the point of a game is to win, so if you're not going to try to win, then why start the game in the first place?

Played like a solitaire game, largely ignoring what other players do and just doing your own thing, and at the end you see if you happened to win or not, I could see the game going faster. But if you try to win, you constantly have to track who has what helper (in case they could trade our resource out from under you), who has what market stall (in case you want to swap with them), etc. Therefore it takes much longer than it should, and a lot more work than it should, for something which is 90% bookkeeping.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
At the Gates of Loyang is essentially a logistical puzzle of getting the right veggies to customers on time. The major choke point is that each field only produces one vegetable each round, so players have to plan ahead to ensure a steady supply of vegetables. The forward planning aspect also makes the seemingly minor disruptions by opponents' Helpers actually matter a lot.

Despite the lack of flashy mechanisms or complex networks, Loyang is my favourite among Rosenberg's big box efforts. This is a streamlined game with clearer tradeoffs, and it strikes an ideal balance between long-term planning and tactical drafting decisions. I also appreciate that it requires constant thinking, but without frying my mental circuits every now and then like [thing=35677][/thing] does. The only major caveat is that luck of the draw is felt more keenly with a restrictive scoring system. (A minor caveat would be that the artwork leaves me feeling like I'm interacting with the cast of Mulan.)

As a side note, I evaluate this largely as a 2P game. Adding a third player adds to game length without introducing appreciable value otherwise. On the other hand, the solo game is actually quite good, as the card grid introduces an aspect of manipulating its movement and adds to the foresight of upcoming cards.

I really like this game. It's the only game I've played the solo variant a lot. It can run a but long and turns might be slow but it has food pieces (leek, pumpkin, radish, etc.) which I find amusing. The play is to come up with the most efficient strategy and make use of your resources while trying to buy points (this is huge part of winning). It's easier learning from someone who has played but teaching yourself isn't bad either.

I only learned Loyang recently after owning it for years. The joke is on me because this game is fantastic! You're trying to make the most profitable farm. You have to pay gold to advance on the path of prosperity (the victory point track). You can buy as many as you'd like at the end of each of the nine rounds. The first one costs 1 gold and the next costs a number of gold equal to its value. So if you're on space 4, it would cost 1 gold to move up to 5, but then 6 more gold to move up to 6 and so on. Thus, it's easier to advance more than one space a turn at the start of the game. However, you're super poor at the beginning as you haven't had time to build up an engine. Just another stellar design by Uwe and one I look forward to playing much more!

RATING: 5
It's a good game that works well. Clearly this was developed from Bohnanza and was the inspiration for Agricola.  Nice ideas, but I feel that it suffers from too many serious issues.  

First and foremost, the downtime is brutal.  You must go in turn order as minor things can change by the time it is your turn.  Some of the cards interact so turn order is important. So that means you have the long wait for your turn to roll up.  When it is your turn, there is so much to do that even if you are actively moving all of your crap around, you can't help but feel guilty by holding everyone up (despite the fact that they'd all held you up).  It is an efficiency model, so it is important to make sure that everything is in place.  If you do things out of order it costs you more, so even if you know exactly what needs to be done it takes time to figure out the optimal way to do it.  God forbid you play this with someone with analysis paralysis.

Second, it is overly long and repetitive.  It is kind of interesting in the beginning, but then you find that you are just doing the same kind of stuff over and over again. An hour later you are still doing the exact same thing only now you are collecting different suits.  It isn't a short game, and it has no story arc, so the repetition really is exacerbated.

Third, the luck of the draw is too extreme. If cards come your way you are stoked, if they don't it forces a little more creativity, but really if you are only drawing trading merchants with your two pack, aka Tupac, you are going to be really bummed.

Fourth, there never is an exciting moment in the game.  Even when people gang up on you and give you a good humping, the result is usually that you have to pay an extra couple dollars to do something close to what you wanted to do.  Now I'm not a fan of "take that" mechanisms, here it seems like it is a desperate attempt to force interaction in the system.  In concept, I'm glad that the attempt was made, but the result compounds the need for turn order and thus the downtime.  So while I'm pleased that the way cards hit you it isn't too extreme, they don't really matter all that much.  So you just kind of muddle your way through the endless motion of moving cubes.

Perhaps I'd like this game more as some online implemented game where you just check in once a day, but as is, it just isn't what I want in a face to face board game.

Another wonderful game by Uwe Rosenberg. This one in particular has high quality components, and overall has a major "cuteness" factor as one friend put it.  Everything is colorful and just plain looks good. The turns are fast paced and, unlike other games, there is rarely a moment when you are sitting around for a long time waiting for other players to take their turns.  The entire game is pretty involving, and there is a lot of player interaction.

I used to think this was the 'lightest' of the Harvest Trilogy but after playing with different people I actually think Le Havre is the easiest to teach and introduce to new players, despite seeming much heavier.

Upfront I'll state that this is my least favorite game of the Big Box games I've tried by Uwe Rosenberg, but by no means is it a bad game. For me, a 6 is still above average (although not by much) and I'll play the game from time to time. 
Like other Uwe Rosenberg games this is a resource management and optimization game, but more so than the others this is a logistical puzzle. You have to manage up to 9 fields where you can harvest up to 6 different types of vegetables, ultimately to satisfy both your regular and your incidental customers. Sell your vegetables with the most profit to buy the most victory points and win the game.
Unlike Agricola there is no worker placement mechanic and unlike Le Havre and Ora et Labora there is no common pool of buildings to buy and use. Because of this, this game lacks most of the indirect interaction the other games have to offer. The player interaction comes in the form of a card drafting round at the start of each turn and cards come in 5 varieties: extra fields, regular customers, incidental costumers, markets (to trade vegetables) and helpers for all kinds of benefits.
My two biggest gripes with the game are not being able to plan your actions more than the current turn which doesn't relly fit well with a resource management logistical puzzle in my opinion. The second gripe is that in a game lacking most player interaction, some of the helper cards that do let players interact are pretty harmful. As it is, I'd prefer the game to be a strictly multiplayer solitaire engine game. That's probably better than a game where I can't interact with you, but you can interact with me because you drew the right cards. As a result of both these gripes and the fact that players can do a lot of stuff on their turn downtime is an issue, even more so as you can't really plan ahead during other players turns.
Also, I've never played with more than two players, but there are some very clunky three and four player rules.
Still, by no means is this a bad game, but just not a favorite of mine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Incredibly disappointing, and I'm a huge fan of Rosenberg's latest games.  The early game is super-tight and much relies on the luck of the draw.  It's hard to get things going and the player interaction is quite minimal.  I'm glad I played it, though, because I'd never buy it.

UPDATE: Played it again, and am beginning to appreciate some of the strategy here.  I still think the initial card draw does make quite a bit of difference and the early game is still too tight for me to love it, but I'm much more willing to play it.

UPDATE: Continue to enjoy the game and have also gotten over the angst of the start of the game.  It's good and entertaining, but still not quite at the level of his other two greats.

It's true that this is a good two player game.  Definitely unique with the "buying" points mechanic.  I like the trading aspect.  Some of the cards I like, some I don't. Stealing from your opponent is something I never enjoy.   The components are top notch.  My wife seems to love all of Uwe's games, mainly because of the components.  We both found the gameplay to get a little frustrating with more plays, due to the fact that if you make an early mistake, it's pretty difficult to catch up.

This is a good example of a genre I dislike: optimization puzzles confined to individual player boards. There's not enough interaction to make you care about anyone else, but there's just enough to prevent everyone from taking simultaneous turns, and since the game is so long, you spend a lot of time sitting and watching other players. There's little or no expectation that it'll affect you. Consequently, there's not enough fun in Loyang. Under no circumstances would I play again with more than two players. But as I said above, it's a [i]good[/i] example of a genre I dislike, so I'd consider playing again 2p.

Update after several more plays at Yucata: the game is [b]much[/b] better with just 2 players! 

---
An interesting game, but after 2 plays I think I still don't really get it. At least, I don't get how to do [i]well[/i] at it! There are some really interesting mechanisms here: simultaneous turns (4 players), and the card exchange (pretty brilliant, really!). But there seems to be somewhat significant randomness and chaos here, too, mostly due to the way the cards come out (your own fields, but mostly from the deck of cards): access to extra fields, getting the "right" customers, luck of the two-pack draw, and the occasional player interaction where one person has a helper who can steal your market stall or customer or helper! The game is almost multiplayer solitaire -- which would be fine since I generally enjoy building an efficient engine, except for those semi-random (screw-your-partner) cards!
And as others have noted, the game seems to go on a bit too long. 

I'll stick with Le Havre as my favorite so far!

--- Summary ---
Players each have a deck of fields (2 of each card, each shuffled into top/bottom half) and a starting field, with 3-9 spaces on them. They also have a personal market from which to buy/sell veggies; start the game by buying and planting one veggie -- when you plant, fill the other spaces of the field with the same veggie (from Supply). In future turns, you'll harvest 1 veggie/field (empty field is discarded). After harvesting, deal out 4 cards/player. In turn, players either discard a card into the face up pool, or play ONE card from their hand and ONE from the pool (then discard the rest into the pool). The last player to play cards picks the 1st or 2nd player to play as their partner (4er game). Then, the 3rd and 4th players simultaneously take their turns, but any interaction cards may only be played on their "partner". After that, the other 2 players play.

On their turns, players will be buying/selling veggies to the market or customers (cards), planting veggies into fields, etc. The variability here comes from the combination of cards you've managed to acquire: regular customers demand the same veggies x 4 turns (steady income) but cost you money if you fail to deliver, and they have lower payoffs than casual customers (who become available randomly from the deck of cards). At the end of each player's turn, they may buy 1 VP for $1, and additional VP for the cost shown on the next space of the VP track (1->20). 

The game ends after 9 rounds; the player with the most VP wins (tiebreaker = cash)!

Out of the three games I think this one has the most potential for me.  My one most important hesitation right now is if it boils down to card draws.  With a game this close and tight that could be a significant factor.  On the other hand, there are enough draws during the game where that should seemingly even out, as opposed to Agricola, where drawing a powerful occupation, for example, can give a player a major boost.  I like the puzzle aspect here on each turn, plus there's even more going on because you have to consider long-term benefit instead of just maximizing income on each turn.  Also, normally the bits don't matter that much to me, but I love them here.  I'd like to try solo play too.  I can see my rating going up after playing some more.

I got this game as a collector and huge fan of Uwe Rosenberg's other "harvest trilogy" games (Agricola, Le Havre, and later Ora et Labora).

All three of those games feel very similar and I love them all but this one doesn't feel the same.  The game is played by drafting cards that give you fields, customers, market stalls, and helpers that allow you to harvest and sell crops for money.  You buy your victory points each turn and they are cheaper the earlier in the game you buy them.

Each player ends up with a miniature economy and the money is very hard to come by.  This is a fine game and the balance is commendable but it doesn't interest me as much as Rosenberg's other efforts.  Aside from some of the helper cards there is virtually no interaction and the game ends up really just about creating the most efficient personal economy.  This gets a bit dry.

It is still a decent game and one I don't mind playing but also not one I'm going to bring out on my own too often.  I've heard this game described as Antiquity: the Card Game and I definitely get that with the harvest mechanics and the complex puzzle feel.

It doesn't have a clear interactive feeling after the initial draw. I don't like the way cards interact in players' strategy because it can be too much strong. It's one of those games that give too much work for some random card played by another player destroy.

You don't get much game for the price. Same size box as the Gric or Le havre with a fraction of the contents. Despite this it is a great game, the drafting system is genious and there are loads of tricky choices. Refreshigly different from the other games in the 'farming cycle' - the importance on early points means you can't wait to get an engine going. 

This is a real brain burner. The auvtion resets means you can't put your brain into neutral at any point in the game. It's good but not as good as the 'Gric or Le Havre

Some one described this is as 'the best game they never want to play again' and i think that might be fair. I will play it if asked but i doubt i'd suggest it.

Blech. I already disliked Le Havre with its many chits and special buildings cum resource converters. This is even worse. Scoring points is a very cumbersome task and the downtime is horrible. To be fair: I played this only with three and the downtime is supposed to be better with two. But I'm not interested at all in finding out.

It's well executed for what it is, but this is clearly not for me. From now on, I'll actively avoid these monster resource games by Rosenberg (I already should have known better when I played this, though).

A challenging economic game, and exactly what one can expect, given that this is the predecessor of Agricola.  There is a little more of a luck component to this game, as the cards one draws affects what options the players have, and although there is a card exchange, it is typically filled with the cards one wants the least.  We wound up seeding it with one random card in our two-player game in order to give more selection, since the blind-draw from the deck can result in a customer that could be an ongoing points penalty.  I do like that the catch-up mechanic has to do with buying your way forward, so the further ahead you are, the more it costs to maintain that advantage.

Enjoyable vegetable shuffling/swapping/trading but with some shortcomings. I think (1) the game is a bit repetitous, and last round is almost the same as second or third one, (2) there's is no evolution/impovement/growth during the game, you may accumulate some helpers or seed more plants, yet, no strategic approach (3) rules are a bit long, although after first play everything is clear (4) feels like overblown 2-player game. My wife likes it a lot, through. Gorgeous components and very good, yet clear and simple graphic layout.

RATING: 7.5
This is a nice low-key game that is fun to play.  I am giving it a high score on just two plays (a solo & a 2-player).
The solo was a bit boring and I was reluctant to play again.  So, I didn't play for another 8 months until a friend came over and he picked it out.  We had a tough time with the rules to the card phase but after watching a video (UFBRT) we broke through that barrier and proceeded to play.  Things went smooth after that and we had a surprisingly good time with the game; both leaving with definite intentions of playing again.
  This makes for a great 2-player game; probably due to the fact that the game doesn't rely on a lot of player interaction.  I would describe it as a balancing act of producing vegetables and having the right buyers; while trying to earn the most money possible to convert to vp.  Its a bit of a puzzle and picking the right helpers to aid you in your efforts adds depth to the game.

Fun game. A bit too long for what it is and it is definitely the weakest of Uwe's Harvest Trilogy. We do enjoy it very much and it is a worthy addition to my collection. 

Great two player game which has somewhat replaced Jambo for us. We feel it scratches the same itch that Jambo does and we tend to enjoy the meatier games more, so Jambo has taken a back seat to Loyang. 

Loyang is a fantastic game, as long as you're not expecting another masterpiece a la Agricola or Le Havre.

Producing goods, selling to customers, then buying VP. While Le Havre felt like Agricola (but different) this actually felt more of a descendent of Antiquity (an acknowledged influence on Agricola) since your 'income' is basically goods harvested each round. Loyang has no worker placement. What it does have is a number of interesting mechanics that seem novel variants on familiar mechanics, but they combine to create a tight game of developing goods-generating streams, drafting cards to create trade/special action/customer abilities, then striving to satisfy the demand you've created to earn cash which you have to convert into VP on an ongoing basis.

Love the pieces and the art! However, the gameplay is a different matter. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is good -- but there are some problems. The game suffers from a run-away leader problem that is mainly determined in the first 3 rounds of the game. There is a high luck factor in those turns, and getting the right Regular Customer can pretty much ensure victory over anyone else because it is nearly impossible to overtake someone on the Path to Prosperity unless they mess up completely (not likely to happen with any experienced players) or get REALLY bad luck in their cards (again, not that likely).

Of course, this was my impressions from my first play of the game -- I'll have to play it again to really get a good feel for it. I like it, but I hate it. It needs SOMETHING to make it work better, not sure what that something is right now, but hopefully another play or two will help me figure it out.

WARNING: This game can get very long in analysis paralysis! Our first game (a 3-player game with rules and some minor examples before we started) lasted nearly 4 hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Original (05-22-17): My favorite game! There's no real diversity in scoring or strategies, it's just figuring out the best way to maximize profit from round to round. However, there's just something about how all the parts integrate together and make such a wonderful game.

There's the tension created by the card distribution phase, where players have to potentially risk cards they need by putting them up for everyone else to have a chance to take before they can play it. There's the brain-straining contemplation from figuring out the best combination of actions that will squeeze out that extra cash. Then having to decide how to spend your hard earned money, either advancing along the scoring path or investing in things to make future profit.

The game includes a rather well designed solo game as well, which is pretty fun to play. Not as good as the multiplayer game but still helps to make the game worth buying even if it's hard to get to the table with others.

Overall, a very well designed game that continues to remain challenging even after several plays. 10/10

Played once. Credits say inspired by Antiquity!! Interested peaked, must read rules.  Update: Not much interaction.  The card drafting is kind of neat but you don't have that much control of who you will be able to interact with.  In the four player game the last person gets to choose and that's it.  During the drafting you may be able to choose one person that you definitely won't be able to interact with by when you pass.  Then the interaction cards are mostly just random monkey wrenches.  I have some things in my market stalls.  One or two I NEED this turn and my "partner" plays a trader to take one.  He probably takes something he needs and not just the thing I really need, but it is random what he needs so it may or may not be the thing that screws me.  I like the play in your own sandbox kind of games but I think it would be more interesting if there was a central market board that had supply and demand of the goods.  Perhaps it wouldn't work in this game but it has me thinking about a variant/game design. 2010/07/08

After playing [thing=31260][/thing] at the meet up and not being 100% sold on the game, I was a bit wary of this which is another game that gets broken out every time. I have always been more drawn to the 'look' of this game and so I took the opportunity to get a 4p game in. This was a game that definitely 'clicked' a lot more for us. While I feel like playing Agricola more would lead to more enjoyment of the game, I also couldn't help but feel that once you do get better at it the game becomes, well, a snorefest (thus, I suspect, all the card expansions to keep it 'interesting'). I didn't get the same feeling from this game and the husband was very much enamored with it as well (despite his dreadful playing :D )
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I really like the mechanics involved in this game, but when it comes to actually playing, the different mechanics get in each others way.

This review is based on the 3-payer game, which the rules seem to encourage as the intended way to play the game.

The semi-drafting of cards means that newer players can unknowingly give more experienced players insane cards for fear that the mediocre card they want gets taken (but that's fine by itself).

What really hurts the game is the fact that it is impossible for players to take their turns at the same time because of the red worker cards. Even if there are no interactive elements on the board, players can luck into a relevant worker with the "Buy a Two-Pack" action that it seems a waste not to use almost every turn.

So players must wait for every other player's turn, casing a significant amount of downtime where there probably isn't anything important going on, but there [i]could[/i] be. The downtime in this game is killer.

I once had a friend pull out a newspaper while playing a game, and I never thought I would find a game that warrants that kind of treatment until now.

Very nice game. Harvesting similar to Agricola. I like that the score is during the hole game very close. 1 point more is much, 2 points more are very much. You buy the points for money, but as longer the game goes, so higher is the price. And you need money not only for the points. It would be a "solo game for up to 4 players", but we have the helpers. They bring interaction to the game.

So why my rating is only 6. Because the game has 2 big faults. 
1. Downtime - with 3 players you are waiting too long for you turn. You can think about your own move, but it is not so complicated as for example in Through the Ages. So i know quiet fast, what i want to do and than i`m waiting long.
2. The game is too long! With 3 players we play 3,5 hours! But the game is not so complicated.

Végre ezzel a játékkal is játszottam.

Egyáltalán nem az a könnyed játék, mint amit gondolna az ember a zöldségtologatós téma alapján. Szerintem legalább annyira bonyolult, mint az Agricola. Vagy ha egyszerűbb is, a téma kevésbé jelenik meg a szabályrendszerben, és lehet, hogy ettől bonyolultabbnak tűnik. Valahogy olyan furán függnek egymástól a paraméterek, és a kártyák szöveges tulajdonságai is mind elég trükkösek ahhoz, hogy elsőre ne legyen világos, hogy mire is jó.

Amúgy egy jó játék, és - ahogy Daniel mondta, - tényleg csodálatos, hogy a szerző ilyen összetett játékok terén ennyire újszerű és különleges játékötletek egész sorát tudja felvonultatni a mostmár évente megjelenő játéksorozatában. Le a kalappal Uwe Rosenberg előtt.

Like Agricola, a highly enjoyable game of optimization. The card drafting mechanic can make this game fairly luck-based, a feature I normally HATE in games since I have horrible luck, and so it's really a testament to how good this game is that even though bad card draws have cost me the game at least once, I still like it a lot and want to keep playing it!

Odd departure for Uwe; vegetables are strictly comparable in value (whereas resources seem so different in Agricola and Le Havre).  No worker placement or resource collection.

Still, not terrible.  Not something I'd break out with other gamers, but relatively enjoyable to play with players who don't need interaction.  The game is a nice little optimization puzzle that is very tactical and reactive rather than long-term strategic.

I enjoy the "solo" puzzle solving aspects of this game.  There isn't a lot of player  interaction, but when there is, it's huge.  There can be heaps of downtime if you play with people who have AP.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great game, with maybe a little AP problem.  I like how money is tight, but loosens as the game goes on, yet additional points cost more as the game goes on.  It's tough to keep up.  Some planners may not like the possibility of another player messing with them, but there is that possibility here.

I'll start off by saying I played this 3 player when, in retrospect, this should really only be played 2 player.  There is A LOT of downtime in the game, and it's the bad kind of downtime where you are twiddling your fingers most of the time instead of deeply engrossed in what your opponents are doing.  I think it would be OK 2 player, but with 3 player it took way too long.  I think our game was close to 3 hours, but it feels like a game that should be 60-90 minutes.

The game play mechanisms are fairly standing farming tropes, but I have to give the game credit for the card play mechanism.  At the start of each round, each player is dealt a hand of 4 cards.  Then, players take turns doing one of two things.  The first option is to discard one card from your hand into a community pool of cards.  Or, you can choose one card from your hand and one card from the community pool and those will be your two cards for the round.  If you do this, the rest of the cards in your hand get added to the community pool.  If you wait until you only have one card left, you have to take the second option.  This was a really neat twist on drafting that I would like to see in more games.

After one play I'm pretty sure I would rather play [thing=31260][/thing] every day of the week, but I would like to try this with 2 players and see if it shines.

This is a pretty cool game. Only ever played it solo, so take my rating with a normal grain of salt. I love how meditative it is, but would probably be a bummer in a 4 player game - I get restless with AP. Maybe not? Totally worth my time and will always be happy to play :) The randomness of the cards makes the game replayable, and there are SO MANY combinations and situations that come up, which is why it's a 9 and not a 10.

This is an initial rating ... I have hopes that trying Loyang as a two-player game will improve my opinion of it. However, I'm unlikely to play this again with four players, as it becomes a massive time-suck, far exceeding the advertised 100 minutes. I like some of what's going on here, and the choice of whether to buy cheap, early victory points or to plow money into an engine that pays off in the later stages is difficult (and balanced). The veggie-meeples are cute, and there's a lot of room for tactical creativity by players. All in all, a decent game that I fear is a bit (and possibly quite a bit) too long for what it is, and certainly not rising to the rarefied air that Uwe's masterpiece Agricola (or even Le Havre) inhabits. Update: I have now tried this with two. Definitely better than with three or four, but still too long. The bits are great and it's a harmless way to pass the time, but its a puzzle game with little interaction, the downtime is too long (never mind the overall game length) and the decisions just aren't all that interesting.

Within the designer's "Havest Trilogy," this title sits in the middle.  At the Gates of Loyang offers neither the claustrophobic contraint of Agricola nor the agoraphobic opportunity of Le Havre.  Instead, At the Gates of Loyang is easy to learn and fairly forgiving as the rounds advance.  It's a little lengthy and frankly, not terribly original compared to other resource conversion Euros.  That makes it neither as extreme nor as distinctive as its brothers, for better or worse.

Great game. I have played solo games and 3player games. I like how you can challenge yourself in the solo game. haven't got past 13.

RATING: 7
While the game plays well with 2 players, this one misses the "Top of its genre" mark that both Agricola and LeHavre hit.  It really feels like the veggies could have been cubes this time - change one color for another, and provide a set to take some coins (which I might add, we dont seem to have enough of for more than 2 players...)

RATING: 5
An okay game. The way the card draft is handled is pretty unique. You have four cards in hand and you can either play a card to the middle of the table as a way to pass, or you can play a card from hand as well as a card from the middle. This way you have to decide to either take whichever cards are available, or possibly help your opponents by playing more cards that they can draft.

The way fields are planted and harvested is also nice. It's basically the wheat-planting mechanic from Agricola/Caverna, but it's a more central mechanic of this game.

I've got a couple of issues with the game. The luck factor of the card draft can be huge. Sometimes you need a certain type of card to come up and it just doesn't. Other times the opposite is true. For example, a player may build two types of vegetables early, say cabbage and turnips, and a regular customer who needs cabbage and turnips comes up in the next card draft. That player now has a steady flow of free money coming in for at least a few rounds. If that doesn't happen, you usually have to work pretty hard to get anywhere because money and resources are really tight. 

Another issues is the way points are handled. At the end of each round you can pay one dollar to move up on the score track, and then pay an amount of money equal to the amount of points to move up more steps. This is a neat idea in theory but near the end of the game it can be obvious who is going to win, especially all throughout the final round or two. Most information is open so you can easily tell if somebody will have enough money to move up enough steps to win.

A few unique ideas, but I would rather play many other games over this one.

Sold.

I had a strong reaction to this game when I first played it. I liked it, but the helpers really bugged me. I thought they were overly complicated, antagonistic, and injected unneeded unpredictability into the game. Played again without the "attacky" helpers (the ones with the lanterns - though that covers more than just the attackers)and it was perfect. Very breezy, satisfying puzzle element with just enough player interaction to keep you on your toes - the card selection phase is unusual and interesting. It's also the only game I can think of that seems like it would be fun solo. The components are nice too, though a step down from really nice meeple-looza games like Caverna.

RATING: 7.5
After a first play this looks like it could be another  winner. It is a medium-heavy economic game with an interesting element of randomness in the way cards are picked each turn. I really like the play-off between making money (and scoring cheep victory points) early on investing in your economy (planting fields). There is also a small amount of interaction between players which is made even more interesting by the pairing mechanism in a 4 player game.

Our first game took over 3 hours but I would expect the time to go down in later plays as people get used to the mechanics and what the cards do. There is certainly a lot of scope for AP this might be a problem for some people. The simultaneous movement mechanic certainly helps to keep the game ticking along with 4 players.

I hear this one is considered a "black sheep" among the Rosenbergs.  I don't get that at all.  I think it is very good.  Tight mechanisms and very close play.  Each play so far has ended with players close together in score, having to use money as the secondary tie-breaker.  It's a solid resource management/engine builder and quick to play once all players get what's going on.  Probably at its best player count at 3, although the solo mode is an interesting adaptation of gameplay.  If there is a central complaint, it's that the four-player rules are a little wonky, which only highlights that it's best as a low player count game.  All said, I like this very much and my group wants to get it to the table frequently.

Pretty neat game, and very challenging!  Uwe Rosenberg's farming theme shines fully in this where you take on the roles of Chinese market... something.  You know, I don't really know what your supposed to be playing as.  But you farm veggies, sell them, and try to build up a revolving customer base.  So it's one part farming, another part economics, which is an awesome thing to play.  This game is great for people that have trouble planning actions, because it forces them to pay attention and make better moves.  For the first game, I would definitely help people out, especially because it will go much faster that way.  After you get a seasoned (pun non intended) group of farmer-merchants, the game flows easily and it will be lots more fun.  I'm so glad to have this on my shelf and I hope I get to play it for years to come!

Good game, but just seems a bit long for what it is.  Playing with experienced players does speed things up, as does helping the other player with banking and planting on their turn.  After 10 plays, this seems like a game where your score can really depend on the cards that are available to you at certain stages of the game.  Since you receive cards throughout the game, this has a different feel than Agricola, where cards also have a great influence on your score, but you know up front what you're dealt.  In Loyang, you may start out well, but not be able to finish strong if the cards dry up.  I'm interested in seeing how satisfying the games will be (or how frustrating this issue will become) with repeated plays with experience players.

EDIT: Another 6 plays logged over Winter Break 2012, and I would still agree with the card issues.  The frustration level isn't too high, but I'm certainly aware each game of my reliance on getting the right two-pack at the right time.  I haven't tried any of the variants, so I may need to read up on those and see if it makes a noticeable difference.

Loyang is a merchant game at its base, but it has a very unique feel in the particular way the cards can drive gameplay (definately some randomness here) and how resources are exchanged for points. There's no worker placement in this one, just card drafting. There's no technology/skill advancement, just the ability to time your play against available cards. There is definately depth to the strategy and this plays very well with 2 or 3 players. I would recommend it to all who enjoy medium to heavy Euros.

This game is seriously underrated. It's so good. Plays smoothly, is balanced, but it also allows you to pull of really cool combos.

The ebb and flow of the gameplay(starting with few resources, peaking mid-late game, than having scarcity in the late game again) gives it an unique feel and separates from the classic engine building games.

Lots of mechanism(hand management, push your luck, resource conversion, engine building) but they all  integrate nicely. 

A real gem. Best with 2.

1 solo game so far to learn the rules. Tense all the way through, Loyang is a light economic game in a small, good looking package. Seems best solo, but I'll try it two player with James at some point.

**UPDATE**

I've played this 2 player now and I think Loyang is quite solid, if a little on the light side. I discovered that we played the card distribution phase REALLY wrong (as I discovered is the case for many first time players), so I look forward to giving Loyang abother go with the correct rules.

**UPDATE**

I have now played it with the correct rules and while there is no doubt whatsoever in my own mind that Agricola and Le Havre are better designed games, I find Loyang more fun that both of them.

Overall I have to say this game is too long for the little pay off you get out of it. With that said I feel this is ONLY a 2 player game. Honestly to me it feels like it was designed to be a 2 player game and the idea of more was just tacked on afterwards. Decisions in this one are not too agonizing and I like that detail in some games.

Loyang was one of the big games getting a lot of buzz in the weeks leading up to Essen, and rightfully so as it's the follow-up release to Agricola and Le Havre (although designed prior to either according to Uwe). However, the game did surprisingly poorly on the GeekBuzz ranking at Essen and again at BGG.CON. Before having had a chance to try Loyang I wondered whether the low ratings were due to response bias (i.e., those predisposed to like Loyang were buying it sight unseen and therefore not playing/rating it, while undecided people were playing and rating it). After having had a chance to try Loyang, I think its low ratings are instead likely due to the disappointment that many fans of the first two installments in the "Harvest Trilogy" felt in seeing how much Loyang diverged from its brethren and how it felt like a step backwards from Uwe's games released over the past couple years. I need to try Loyang again with fewer players, but I didn't feel as if the game worked at all with 4 players. It's likely a two-player game at heart; a dry, procedural, mathematical two-player game (with significant randomness of the two-pack card draw thrown in to majorly disrupt your precise planning), but the designer and/or publisher tried to stretch the game to include up to 4 players. To combat the inevitable downtime and boredom that results from this distortion, the game instructs you to have two players acting simultaneously at any given time, although the pairings will shift from turn to turn. This idea sounds all well and good until you discover that there is an intriguing card draft at the beginning of each round, including some "helper cards" that can disrupt an opponent for your personal gain. Since the four-player game requires the simultaneous-play rules to move at a reasonable pace, you are limited to only playing cards that affect one other member of the opposite pairing. This does not work. You only get to keep two cards per draft, which are generally resources and customer cards to whom you sell your resources for money, with which you buy victory points. A few of the cards are these "helper cards" that can steal resources, customers, and assorted other things from opponents, but sadly it's not opponents, rather opponent. Without knowing how the pairings will work out each turn, you can have no idea whatsoever whether these cards you're drafting will be useful or completely useless. That being said, even with fewer players, I just can't see this measuring up to the competition created by Uwe himself. In Agricola you get to build a farm, try out card combinations, and vie with opponents for limited actions/resources. In Le Havre you get to amass a mountain of resources and buildings giving you a massive playground in which to convert and sell your resources while trying to extort visitation fees from opponents and not take out too many loans in the process. In Loyang you "get to" slowly and painfully creep your way up the score track by pinching every penny as you play through a rather solitaire experience of manipulating your small number of available cards each turn, and ultimately get to end up tied with most of your opponents and seemingly likely decide the game by a tiebreaker. Take your pick.

Uwe has made another masterpiece here. I do not like Agricola (it is a very nice game but not my kind of game). Le Havre is one my favorite games. And now Loyang! Components, are excellent. The rulebook is great. The game is simple but you need to read carefully the rulebook! This is the most fun game from the 3 that Uwe has designed so far. It is intuitive, it is well balanced, there is a lot of tension, there is interaction, it has new and innovative mechanics (like the scoring). It rocks!!! It takes time to explain the rules to people that have not play any of his other games (but well this is my only negative I can give to this game). Get your copy today. For the people that enjoy these kind of games, do yourself a favor and play Antiquity (more heavy than Loyang).

I'm a Uwe Rosenberg fan.  So I was predisposed to like this game.  It has the added benefit of feeling a lot different than Agricola/Le Havre/Ora et Labora.

[thing=39683][/thing] is a good game by Uwe Rosenberg. It plays reasonable fast, the interaction, though not huge, is there. The decisions are interesting ones and must be made, sometimes, with one, two or maybe even more rounds in advance, which is a plus for me.

My only beef with this game is a personaly one: I found that the matches were really similar in the feel of the game. The decisions are the same, and the ways to go foward, basically the same (in reality, they aren't really the same, but they do [i]feel[/i] like it).

But, even with this, I enjoy it quite a bit.

There is a good game in here somewhere. This is either a solo game for three players or a light three-player game that is over-complicated and somewhat broken. I have rated it as the second of these options because it would get a worse rating (5) as the first option.

I have only played it once, but the problems with it were apparent from that. If played like a solo game it is of course excruciatingly slow. Why not play a proper solo game? If played as a light game, it is just too involved and much of the potential of the game is lost.

In addition to these issues, there are two further problems. One is that the sometimes aggressive player interaction is much less subtle than the solo part of the game and makes the game more clumsy than it was intended to be. The other issue is that I suspect that experienced players would often draw with other experienced players in victory points - it becomes a big thing to make the next point level. Comparing money is too weak a means of choosing a winner in this situation.

Impressive and quick solo puzzly euro with a variability that one doesn't see normally in euro games. Plus, one can consider 17 as a "win" and everything below as a "lost" to improve the challenge. It is always really tight to get to 17. You never feel like "you've figured it out the game" like in other Rosenberg with a non-variable setup. Plus, count 5 minutes of setup, 40 to play and components that you can easily put in a small bag and carry with you and you've got the ultimate solo euro. All of those things explain the unusually high rating. 

Certainly one of my favorite Rosenberg and one for which he actually made a special solo variant unlike for his other games.

RATING: 8
Solo plays only. Best solo Euro that exists (edit: perhaps eclipsed by Spirit Island, but they're so different it's not an either/or).

- It doesn't rely on convoluted resource conversion chains like Le Havre and OeL. There's a place for this directness. While there is a great deal of puzzle-solving calculations, the churning is localized & you arrive at decisions (options) rather than scrying a min/max jumble.

- The scoring mechanism is a wonderful (and self-inflicted) constraint on the economy. Loyang gets it's angstiness from it's pain mechanic. As soon as you do put together a sequence of planned turns and cash out, that cash is drastically reduced by buying out VPs and this keeps the game pressurized. At midgame, struggling on whether to take three steps up the trail & be broke with dwindling fields is a tough call. In feel, it relates more to Agricola than the free-wheeling point harvesting of Le Havre and OeL but with a wide open action selection rather than the constraint of worker placement.

- No damned expansions! ;)

- It feels simple to set up and get going. It sits for me in that London and Tinners' Trail rubric of lesser effort than it's larger and more ambitious sibs but doing what it does so well.

- The cards are simple shoves rather than rambunctious combo-litious, and there are some lovely combos but discrete rather than throwing the table. 

- It's somehow calming. It has an almost archetypal feel, the characters on the cards and the notion of operating a vegetable business. I don't know how else to put this. 

- It's gorgeous. Putting all those wooden veggies mixed together into a big bamboo bowl feels like you're reaching into a bowl of Lucky Charms, but out of the box poured only the marshmallows. 

- I've never understood the complaint that a score of 17 + 12 coin beating 17 doesn't feel meaningful. That's a huge spread. Like the richter scale - an 8 earthquake is a hell of a lot bigger than a 7 - and I like how it maps the way tempo has been successfully or less successfully grasped to make a jump rather than an iteration along a straight line.

- It's a chicken soup game. Play this when you're sick sometime. You'll feel better.

Got to play this at ConnCON 3 player (said to be the longest game, 2 and 4 player is shorter.)  Interesting mechanics, though somewhat complicated.  The cards give you a lot to keep track of all at once.  Strategy is a big question.  Do you spend money on steps, or do you need to keep your money for a later turn?  Will take several more plays to come to terms with best play. (Don't forget to take out a lone on the first turn to buy 2 steps!)

Each player receives two of these cards per round distributed by a bidding/drawing mechanism in which you end up with one of the cards you draw and one of the cards of a public offer filled by all players. Additionally, to these cards you always receive one field for free each round.

Placing one good on a field fills the complete field with goods of this type. Each round, one unit per field is harvested. After planting, harvesting, and distributing cards, each player can use as many actions as he wants, only limited by the number of his cards or the number of goods he owns. At the end of his turn, he can invest the earned money on a scoring track, where early money is worth more than late money. The game ends after a certain number of rounds, and the player who is first on the scoring track wins.

Played this solo maybe 5 times.  

It's good but clunky.  The way you get cards is clunky.  

I like placing the veggies in the field.  Good solo optimization game.

But it's too easy.  Still fun to grow the veggies, but too easy.

I have a bunch of green onions and toms in my RL garden if anyone wants me to be their favorite seller....

Loyang has a bit of a setup but after you play it once you'll find it easier. It plays equally well with 2 and 3 players. Actions can mostly be done spontaneously unless there is an action that can affect resources and order is important. It has been announced that Loyang will be reprinted. I look forward to new players discovering this game. Perhaps there may one day be an expansion to add new helpers, fields and customers.

I like a lot of what the game does, but it is far too long for its weight. I do not see how a 4-player game can be played in less than 2 hours (the game I played took 2.5, but that was with all new players), and the 3-player game will likely take longer. That is a fine length for a reasonably heavy game, but Loyang is pretty light, especially since there is no permanent infrastructure to build up. If it could be played in an hour I would like it a lot more.

Tough game to rate effectively. Probably a few more plays will consolidate my ratings but I have a sneaky suspicion that the extra few plays will bump the ratings down. At the core of it, the game is about building an efficient economic engine to power you through nine rounds of vegetable selling and fulfilling orders. Fulfilling specific orders will net you cold hard cash which could be used to buy victory points, not unlike Princes of Florence, except that victory points cannot be earned any other method. I like the novel scoring system, but unlike others, the card drafting does not work for me. Too many cards on the tableu and too chaotic. The idea behind it is good, just the implementation.

A real brain-burner of a tactical puzzle. Not a lot of interaction between the players so it feels like you and your friend are working on two quite separate puzzles side-by-side. There's an element of strategy when choosing your cards/customers/etc as you are setting yourself up to succeed (or fail) in future rounds. A nice sense of risk and reward that is quite hard to put into board games without fistfuls of dice. More satisfying than fun.

This is another excellent, albeit underrated, Uwe Rosenberg masterpiece!  It happily accommodates 1-4 players but 2 players is its sweet spot.  Loyang is basically a strategy card game in which you are a farmer/entrepreneur in ancient Loyang, China.  The components are high quality wooden veggie-meeples and small individual "T Squares" which serve as your marketplace and scoreboard.  The bright, colorful artwork is beautiful and appropriately Asian in theme.  Perhaps for the price that this one fetches the coins should have been better made than the cardboard disks that are included.  The scoring mechanism is clever as is the way cards enter the game via a courtyard where players may trade them indirectly in a community pool each round.  Game play consists of careful hand management and timing the purchasing, planting, and harvesting of  vegetables in order to fulfill regular and casual customer demands in timely fashion...all whilst trying to outsmart your competitors with the aid of specially powered helpers.  Efficiency and strategic planning are keys to success in this elegant, unique, and "meaty"  but vegetarian contest.  Expect to make tough choices in Loyang.  Expect to have fun solving market challenges.  Enjoy this game's almost addictive qualities and also its high replayability.  I own all of Uwe's top rated creations and At the Gates of Loyang is one of my very favorites to play.  Treat yourself by giving this one a try!   - Tycoon on BGG, April 2016

This game would really be good if it just played in the amount of time that it claims on the box.  The turns are so very very long, so there is a lot of downtime, especially with the 3 player rules.

There's little interaction between players, but the interaction that does occur causes AP (analysis paralysis).  After a player finally decides to go with decision A over B, because of the slight possibility of some obscure case that may come up, 80% of the time you find that the situation couldn't have even occurred.

If you have a gameboy or iphone with games with you while you play, then it's not bad.  If watching someone else agonize over decisions is not your cup of tea, though, then stay away from this game.

Unfortunately, I think this game is far shy of living up to the legacies from the other two in the series (Agricola and Le Havre).

[-] multiplayer solitaire, I don't like the assistants, pretty sure the game would work (better?) without them, card drafting is needed but slows the game down, multiplayer is too long/repetitive for my taste, sologame is interesting but I wish you add more options/control over the cards you can buy to improve replayability (as it is, too much randomness for a pure optimisation solo mode)

UPDATE: Hasn't hit the table after the first play. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's a classic 'couple game', I.e. a non-interactive intellectual activity that you can do in the same room as your partner instead of Sudoku. 

Personally, unless I can nick my husband's buildings, block him, kill his soldiers, end his turn, and hear the lamentations of his spaniel - I'm not interested.

Based on one play, it's a beautiful-looking game and great non-combative fun with two. It is multi-player solitaire and the Path to Prosperity mechanic means that, with good players, there probably won't be much difference in scores.

If you're happy playing a puzzle game with a partner, it's an excellent buy.

I'm not one to play games solo, but 1p Loyang was quite enjoyable for at least a couple dozen plays. My high score is 18 + 12. 

With more than two players this game just takes too long for what it is, plain and simple. I do like it, but it doesn't even come close to Le Havre or Agricola for the simple reason that it doesn't have the interaction of the drafting mechanic. Vaguely similar to Antiquity but not as tense. 

While I have little interest in playing this in person anymore, online at yucata.de the downtime and game length issues disappear, increasing my enjoyment of this pleasant and unique game.

Great solo or 2p game.  (Very slow with 3 or 4.)  Love the market mechanics.  The "offer" for the solo game is brilliant; it adds a puzzle-like aspect that is unnecessary for head-to-head, but is ideal for a solitaire setting.  I am struggling to do better than 18/7-18/10 right now; I need to figure out how to ramp up quickly at the beginning without taking a loan.

As a solitaire game, it's really not bad.  There's definitely a need to be efficient in the game, and the action card tableau adds a little variety and a way for players to speculate for future turns.  It runs a bit tight, money-wise, but I expect that's really the point.  The loans are going to be necessary, as will a good sense of how all the cards interplay.  The bonus for the solitaire game is that there's no down-time, but be careful not to forget a step along the way!  I think I shorted myself points on one turn in an early game.  Regardless, it's a game that has a very good "One more time!" feel to it, as can be attested by my 10 games in one afternoon....

At the Gates of Loyang has the reputation of being somewhat of a disappointment. That isn't all that surprising, considering it was released hot on the heels of Agricola and Le Havre, as the third volume of Uwe Rosenberg's Harvest Trilogy. While I have to agree that it is nowhere near as good as those first two titles, I don't really share in the opinion that it is a bad game. 

In fact, I'd say that it is one of the better 2-player games in my collection. Each round of the game features a quick card draft and then a few minutes of agonizing resource management, both of which are features that I enjoy. I also think that the solitaire rules in Loyang are the most interesting of the Trilogy's solo variants, so here again it fills a valuable role in my collection.

The game's four player mode is a bit awkward though, the weird fluctuating trading partner rules are just more trouble than they are worth.But honestly...I doubt that I would even consider playing Loyang if I had four people at the table. There are so many other games in my collection that work better with four, that I'd just rather play one of those.

If I had paid full retail at a FLGS I might be a lot less satisfied with the game, but as I snagged my copy for under 25 bucks I am perfectly happy with it.

On a side note, it's been well documented that while this game was the last released, it is actually the oldest design of the Harvest Trilogy. From a game design standpoint, it's quite interesting to recognize the aspects of Loyang that were inspired by Bohnanza and then in turn to see what parts of Loyang inspired both Agricola and Le Havre. 

Solitaire High Score: 15 points, 14 cash.

RATING: 7
This is a very subtle game...probably too subtle for me. There is player interaction...but aside from the card phase (where decisions may or may not matter hugely to the other players depending on your hand), it's entirely possible to go several turns without directly interacting with your opponent(s). This is an odd feeling in a game that feels a lot like a worker placement game. Probably my biggest nitpick is that the macro strategy seems to be pretty much the same each time: set up fields, then use the engine to get paid. I guess you could say that every game with a VP-type system only has one path to victory if you distill it, but this one seemed to offer fewer choices in how to get there than others (which is ironic, given that mechanically it really does feel like a worker placement game where you have infinite workers and no blocking). In Agricola, for example, you're looking to have a diversified farm by the end of the game, but how are you going to build your engine - vegetables, animals, or can you get a good card combo going? This is not to say that there aren't decisions - there are, and interesting ones at that, which is why I still give it a 7. However, they seem to me to be nuanced choices (I want to say tactical, but I don't think that's entirely accurate) rather than ones that give you freedom to pursue other paths. (An example of something I've tried but I don't think is viable is trying to sacrifice some planting power to support a large, early customer base and buy points while they're cheap.) Hence my statement at the beginning that it may be too subtle for me. Two other, minor negative points: the downtime can be severe at times, and it's possible for the outcome to be a forgone conclusion a few rounds before the game actually ends. Neither of these are huge or significantly worse than other games I've played with these issues. My rating may end up rising with further plays if I can discern more variability in gameplay rather than just better min/maxing, and I would play it again, so we'll see.

Kind of a tough game for me to rate.  It's tempting to compare it to Agricola since they're both by Uwe Rosenberg and about farming.  Even though they're otherwise not that similar, I'm going to do just that.

I really enjoy the puzzly logistics of Loyang a lot, and that aspect is emphasized much more in Loyang than Agricola.  However, there is much less interaction in Loyang than in Agricola, and not as much of the rewarding feeling of "building something cool" (i.e. a farm).

In Agricola, each player takes one action per turn, with 2-5 actions per round, and players are competing for the same actions.  This leads to lots of interaction, but less ability to pull off amazing logistical "combos", which are frequent in Loyang (if you're clever).

In Loyang, players take an arbitrary number of actions all at once (often 10+, though I've never actually counted); only a few of these impact other players.  This leads to a more isolated puzzle-like feel, with less interaction but more flexibility and individual control.  I haven't tried the solitaire game yet, but this seems like the rare case where that may be the best way to play.  The other players probably add more time to the game than interest.  That sounds more damning than I really mean--the game works great with multiple players, but it's biggest strengths should come out just fine in the solo game while also being much quicker (except that there will be nobody to witness your genius).

I actually like that there are many fewer cards in Loyang, and the same ones are used each game.  It's true that this also leads to less variety, but I'm more likely to play this game a few dozen times than several hundred, so I'm fine with that.  It provides a more balanced game and a nicer learning curve, and that's more important to me.

This game has a unique drafting system, and a unique way to get points. Otherwise it's a nice conversion type of game, but there is one huge problem that sours the whole thing for me. Other than the drafting the game would be multiplayer solitaire, so the designer put in some "interactive" cards. These are some of the lowest form of take that type interaction and while that's a matter of taste (i hate it and i strongly feel it's lazy design) they drag the game down incredibly because otherwise you could do your turns simultaneously and then it would be a one hour game, this way it multiplies with each player. My other problem is even though the game has a nice version of drafting/reverse bidding the game kind of spits in it's own face, by giving you one field each turn semirandomly and the ability to buy two random cards each turn which it seems like you should do a lot. So in a drafting game you get half your cards randomly? Then why draft? I just don't get it. Just imagine if in 7 wonders you did the drafting, then draw some other cards randomly. (This also makes the game even longer because after you carefully planned and drafted, you get two other random cards that if they are any good you need to re-plan a lot of things).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Falls in nicely between Agricola and Le Havre.  If you like either of those two games, this one won't disappoint you.  If you have both those other games, do you need this one?  I think so.  It's different enough to stand out on its own in game play and mechanics.  A good gamer's game from this year's 09 crop.

I wonder how much differentiation there really is in this game - it seems like the game's outcome will largely be decided by a few dollars here or there.  

Not really the engine building game it initally appeared to be, as your productive capacity is largely limited by the number of fields you can get.

Good game in the Agricola vein, but with much more downtime (mainly because, on each turn, a player performs ALL of his actions before the next player gets to do the same) and with a serious solitaire feel to the whole proceedings.
The special rules for two, three AND four players make it all a bit clunky, especially the "simultaneous actions" mechanic for a four-handed game.

Still worth it, but not as finely tuned as Agricola or Le Havre.

This seems to be an extremely tight resource management game--every decision counts, every card or coin could be crucial. Fortunately, it doesn't have the "feed your workers" mechanic of Agricola (and similar games), which means it is far less stressful. Also, the colorful vegetable pieces are fun to handle and look great in play.

You can see some of the same mechanisms from Rosenberg's most popular offering, Agricola.  Also some other creative mechanisms:  The 'one card from your hand, one from the table' thing is interesting, and the method of pairing people up in four-player to make the game go faster works nicely too.

I liked some of the market aspects, including the four-player discard sequence until you see something you like. I found I had some choices overall, but I didn't feel I could plan that far ahead.

Some rules confusion in my first game didn't really help, as it was a bit unclear how some helpers interacted with the partner system for four-player games. And that partner system did seem a bit weird to me, as it limited choices.

I like that the game had close scoring almost built in, but sometimes that can also feel sort of artificial. Macro-turns were something different, though, which was kind of neat.

Would try again.

Need to play some more times, early thinking is that this is fun but maybe it will play out quickly?  It's a bit long but I would like to try 3 people. 

3 Dec 2016 - Played again as a 2p and found it to be a little processional, like the options available force you down a very narrow road and, most importantly, narrow as you near the end. (I think this would be true no matter the player count.) There is a bit of an arc - the middle of the game is the most interesting but the last two turns are mostly determined ahead of time and it feels like what you're doing doesn't matter. Going to try play with more.

6 Jul 2017 - Ended up trading this away because of the above issues, especially the last few turns where things just peter out. The helper cards often seem a bit useless and I really didn't enjoy the drafting mechanism - I think a simpler "draw x cards and each player selects them one at a time" would work better, especially as it would reduce turn length, which is a major problem in the mid-game. I heard this is good solo, but I didn't ever have the desire to try it. Bumping my rating to a 5.

Seems to have several levels of thinking. You have to get customers for the crops you can produce, you have to plant fields, you have to throw cards away in hopes that you can get the one back you need. I have played twice and still don't see the connections. I find it very frustrating and fall behind on the 2nd or 3rd turn and can never catch up.  However, the game is very good "when" you see the connections.

I think this is my favorite Uwe Rosenberg game so far. There's just something very satisfying about growing your crops and selling them to customers. The small amount of player interaction through the cards is enough to keep the game from feeling like complete multiplayer solitaire. There's a small amount of tension with making sure you keep up with your customers, but it's not nearly as demanding as the feeding mechanic in Agricola. I much, much prefer this to Agricola!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Currently one of the hottest games on our table (2 players). Plays much faster than Agricola, has adorable wooden pieces and gives opportunities for various strategies. Luck is also a factor - sometimes you just seem not to get any customers or get great ones at first.

Our scores land most frequently on 16-17, and have never passed 18 points, so the game has still some tricks to learn.

A generous gift from FTL Secret Santa with Lovable Eyes!

There are some great mechanics here, and it all fits tightly together. That said, adding opponents to the game does not add much to the game. It's largely solitaire, and thus I have to rate this otherwise great set of mechanics rather lowly.

Los jugadores comercian con verduras tratando de sacarles el máximo beneficio. Posteriormente, en la última fase de cada turno, te puedes gastar el dinero en la denominada "Senda de la prosperidad", que es lo que te da la victoria al final de la partida.

So far this is my favorite game by designer Uwe Rosenberg.  I would say that it is my favorite because it plays so well with two players and is heavier, yet very accessible.  I also love how you have to manage paying for extra points earlier at a cheaper rate or waiting until later in the game but having to pay more. This is one of the few worker placement games were actually feel a part of the theme.  It's like I am managing a market with vegetables. I also like how you can use cards to steal resources from the other player or attack them in some sort of fashion.

like the mechanics and theme.  it's reminiscent of agricola and antiquity, and that's a good thing.  unfortunately, the combination of millions of small moves, with potential for interactive plays, means this takes WAY TOO LONG.  at two hours, i could see playing this every once in a while.  at six hours, i could never get this on the table.  EDIT: must've done something horribly wrong, because I've now played a couple more times, with around 3 hour games.  Much more reasonable.

RATING: 6
The economics involved in this game interesting to some extent, but the downtime in between turns is way too long. The implication is the game may only get more interesting after everyone becomes familiar with the game. Sort of like a chicken and egg issue, i.e. novice players may be turned off by the downtime to want to play it more.

Replayability is also a little suspect.

Sadly, the best part of this board game is its components. The vegimeeples are quite attractive.

I am again very happy with a Harvest Trilogy game...this one takes the sowing and harvesting and makes that the central gameplay...optomizing your turn to pinch out the most coins possible and then spending them to buy victory points that get more expensive as the game progresses...love all three games, I would say Agricola has the best theme and is the most fun, Le Havre has the best play mechanics and Loyang has the best ratio of relaxing gameplay to deep thinking...

At the Gates of Loyang is gorgeous to me, and just a pleasure to play. I'm a math geek though, and love trying to optimize my engine down to the last 1 Cash. It's a great one and two player eurogame.

Rules Reminders:
* You start on the 1st Stone on the Path of Prosperity.
* You pay one Cash for the first step on the Path of Prosperity each turn, then the cost of each of the following steps in Cash.

Very good game. Maybe too little interaction sometimes but I like this little puzzle each round when you're trying to earn the most money from cards you have.
This game is different than Le Havre and Agricola - that's very good, but if you wanted another worker-placement-with feeding-game you would be dissapointed.

-- edit --
I don't know why I like this game. It's random, almost no interaction (multiplayer solitaire?) but I like puzzle you have to solve each round. Maybe too long for such a game. Still - I like it quite a lot.

A lot less complicated than its predecessors.  It also requires less time commitment, which is a plus for me.  Unfortunately, the downside to that is it seems to lack the subtlety of Agricola and Le Havre.  There just aren't too many interesting strategy you can do with the limited card selections.  One session is enough to see all there is to offer and I'm afraid that it won't hold up well in multiple plays.

The drafting mechanism is pretty neat.  The partnering, however, feels rather tacked on, since it is only useful in certain scenarios while most of the time it is just another step you have to go through because it doesn't affect your choices what so ever.

I also don't think the penalty for not satisfying an unhappy customer is severe enough, since more often than not paying the two coins is a lot less of a hassle than trying to get the right produces.  Then there is the "strategy" of trading the same item at the market stall just for the sake of using up the card.  Sure, everyone does it, but why create a meaningless loophole just so it can be exploited?

At the Gates of Loyang is a decent game, but also a lot more flawed than Rosenberg's other titles.

It's a bit of a brain burner and also my fiancé likes it! I like some of the mechanics but I haven't played it much with more than 1 player (I mean solitaire). I think it's a bit expensive for what it is (at least lately, at least here).

Third in the Uwe Rosenberg 'trilogy' with Agricola and Le Havre.

Rosenberg liked his Agricola planting/harvesting mechanic so much that he decided to expand it into a game of its own.  It stands up well.

AtGoL isn't nearly as intuitive as Gric or Le Havre, but I think it's actually less complex once you get the rules down.  Can be more prone to AP than Gric.  Lots of downtime in 3p.

Love the veggie-ples.

Trifecta!!  Wow, this is brilliant and agonizing.  I love it!!

[b]4p[/b]: [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b] The four-player simul-play is a brilliant way to cut the downtime to ⅓ what it would have been with purely sequential play.

[b]3p[/b]: [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] The downtime is doubled, but not quite excruciating; however, it does more than double the length of the 2p/4p game.

[b]2p[/b]: [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b] Simply excellent.

[b]1p[/b]: [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b] I love it.  It's a meaty, logistical solitaire game that you can play in under an hour.  The action card grid is delightfully torturous, yet permits for some clever strategic play and combo setup - something you typically don't have in any solitaire game!  (Exception: [thing=35443][/thing])  It's wonderful that Uwe's given us a sufficiently different solitaire experience that I actually specifically want to play this solitaire in addition to multiplayer.  That there is a hook of a mechanism that is unique to the solo game is quite cool!

Loyang is a good game but has very big shoes to fill in (even though I latter found out it preceeded in development both agricola and Le havre).

update: I see more depth now on it. It's definitely not Le havre caliber, but it a pretty good one. I would put it in a close behind after agricola

A game that should normally interest me but simply didn't catch my interest at all. There are lots of games with similar mechanics and optimization around - so no need to deal with this game. It feels, at least to me, that for example Agricola or Caylus offer a lot more. Sadly the game also isn't too intuitive: they tried really hard with symbols but it still feels a bit clumsy and not streamlined to me.

Another Uwe's work, I have to say it is dry to me. It is more like a game that players need to calculate the value of every move, although its theme is a farmer game as same as Agricola. 

The use of the helpers is hard to understand. I am not sure if it is due to the Chinese translation. It makes the game a bit fuzzy.

This is a stand alone classic.  Chess like in nature, it has more diversified pieces and colorful board.  I especially like playing partnership as the play is both quicker and more intriguing.  I own a metal set gold plated.

I bought this game from Donald Benge (the creator) at the United States Fencing National Championships. It's the sort of odd game you find at at that kind of sporting event. It's like chess meets Risk--little complicated, but allows for a lot of abstract strategy without losing the thematic element of a war game.

I was saddened to hear of Donald Benge's death, reportedly caused by a drunk driver.  I met him at an Origins con in the '80s.  He was a very focused, but approachable, individual and always eager to introduce and discuss "Conquest."  Bought the game after his demo.

This is almost more puzzle than game, the trick is to maximize the the abilties of your pieces with the limited number of moves that you have. Good players can see far ahead and pull off some extremely deft combinations. Great game of skill that is probably better than people give it credit for.

This is an interesting game with very little luck that has an interesting board and great pieces. The gameplay is all about area control. If you overextend yourself, you will lose your players quickly, but a quick strike will often gain enough to counter that. You can take strategic areas that reduce your opponents movement.

I'm not a fan of abstract piece-moving games, but this one is a bit better than most, and the components are very nice.  However, this game exhibits a symptom common to many games of this type: there is a massive attrition of pieces throughout the game, and victory is finally determined by a few surviving pieces.

Having read the rules, I can see that there's a solid abstract game here, not unlike chess (even better than chess IMHO). 

I'm eager to put this game on the table! 

UPDATE

I finally played this. Very nice! I would always prefer this over chess. If played with someone that does not go into AP, it is a great strategy game that plays quick and has a lot of replayability.

An interesting Chess like system, with a lot of possible combinations.  Recommend the puzzle books if you would like to learn the finer elements of the game/system.

2-player and 4-player versions available (different boards).  Nice pieces which can lock together (Soldier & Elephant, Soldier & Chariot, etc.)

Area movement where each side has 20 moves per turn.  If you capture an opponent's piece, he/she immediately gets 2 moves to respond, unless it was your last action.

I first encountered this at the junior-high chess club (as cliché as that sounds). When I was interested in the game, I didn't have any interested opponent. Now it seems too much of a boring brain burner to me. If a friend were eager to try, I'd say OK, but it's not something I'd propose. ¶ Seems like it would work better by correspondence, where you can think out your move at your leisure.  Either way, I'd rather play Conquest than Chess.

I think this game is cool. I never got to play it enough, and then I accidently sold it off (doh!).
There is no luck, and everyone starts out equal. The free areas demand that you det into the action from the start.
Very brainy (I guess thats why they made puzzle books for it as well).

RATING: 9
This game has no dice no luck and all sides are identical in. It is not obvious but the map is actually symmetrical to.  In this way it is like a game of chess but with many more possibility reducing the importance of memorizing standard openings and maneuvers. Game was actually designed by a chess master.

It is an easy game to teach to people who have no experience gaming and takes about one hour to play, making it convenient. unlike many games that are suitable for beginners this one is not boring for people who are already experienced.
The 4 player rules stipulate that team mates can not speak to each other.  This way the stronger player dose not play for the weaker one. of course you can also play everyone for themselves.  still is a very social game. 

not much waiting around for others to make a move as it is very hard to plan far ahead.  to many variables for that.

This game plays a bit like chess, it's a move and capture game. You have different type of units which has various movement range and capture rules. Some units can mount over other units. The goal it so reach the enemy castle, build a siege tower and move into the castle.


I have to agree that the miniature design is really interesting. You could for example, place a soldier on an elephant and move that elephant on a boat and all the miniatures will fit together.

The map design is interesting, having dots connected to each other creates interesting layout. Some units can move in between dot which unfortunately adds to the complexity of the game.

One of the problem is that there is just too many types of units. Unless you are an experienced player, it's hard to understand how the game works on your first game.

You also need to count movements in your head and each unit also have a movement limit, you you need to count 2 things at once which is fairly annoying.

There are also some stupid rules like if you capture a unit, you can move again at full speed. So we ended in a situation where a player could cross the whole map because another player sacrificed one of his unit in the middle of the opponent's way to double it's movement.

You also need to move your units in group, because the enemy can counter capture when you capture. So moving them alone makes them vulnerable.

There is not much stuff to build, and the stuff you can build is very expensive. Some people say catapults are extremely powerful, but I find it's the dullest unit you can build. Since you need to be adjacent to a player to attack. The problem is that the board is so large that you will not be able to set a catapult in a strategic area where a player needs to pass where your catapult can hit. So you need to charge with your catapult to be able to use them.

The map does not have any replay value. I would have preferred a modular map where the map would change every time.

So there is a few interesting mechanic, but in the end, the game is not that good, a bit hard to grasp on the first play and has no replay value.

(Two-player version which is how Conquest was originally published).

Cool abstract war game.  Probably one of the earliest action point games (this one has 20 per turn!).  

Basically each piece has a move limit.  Some pieces (ships, elephants and chariots) can transport other (slower) pieces across land or water.  Successful attacks reset that pieces turn-allowance back to zero (momentum).  Additionally defender can battle-back if they have a piece within two moves of the attacked piece (thus killing the attacker).  The game is really about setting up to take advantage of these two features (attack momentum & battle-back).  

I like the game.  It's compared to Chess a lot but I don't really see that too much although I suppose if you wanted to spend a TON of time figuring out how to spend your 20 action points you could make it into that type of game.  I say play quickly and have fun!

Neat, innovative, ahead-of-its-time, Chess-like abstract.  A lot to grokk here, but we had a fun first game.  I can see the potential for a lot of analysis paralysis and fudging, however.

I suck at Chess and I never understood Go, but at least there you move/place only a single figure per turn. Here, you distribute 20 movement points among your units, and each type has a different maximum move. This one is not for me! [traded away on 06/29/07]

Just about the best strategy game ever.  Different numbers of players, no dice, nice pieces.  Endless strategies and the opportunities for balanced game play make this a must.  The first 10 games are addictive, but once you really learn it, there is a depth that you can only surf the waves of and skin dive into limited understandings of your own and your partners mind.

It's a no-luck whack-fest where killing is merely landing on another unit. Move all your troops up supporting each other and then have it out. Or create just-out-of-range stalemates where no one's keen to go first. Either way, the game has little charm. There's a few positional support tricks to learn to allow recaptures on other people's turns. The carrying and disembarkation of troops allow for some interest, as they otherwise have to move a long way to get into the action. Having 20 movement points makes turns too long and prone to over-analysis and downtime. And then there's the classic "how do I defend on two fronts against two enemies" multi-player kingmaking issues. If I'm going to play multi-player slug-fests with all their inherent issues, give me much more fun and quicker turns.

One play, two players, lost horribly

Incredible chess-like variant that plays much faster than expected. Pieces can move great distances in this game; for example, one ship in the center water area can guard all of its spaces. Even though you have twenty action points per turn, the game still moves at a lively pace (every movement from one space to another costs an AP; it's not one AP per piece).



Bonus points for the pieces that fit into each other.

Elegant, well-thought out rules and board geometry. For example, your castle/fort contains five spaces. To win, you must occupy all five of your opponent's castle spaces. However, those spaces are not connected within the castle -- in fact, there is no way that a piece in a castle can capture another piece in the same area.

A wargame created by a chess player who didn't know about existing wargames, supposedly. A neat deterministic ancient warfare themed game. I like it.

The only disadvantage is counting your action points up to 20 each turn, and keeping track of which units have already spent how many points.

I played this long ago in college! Got to play it again, enjoyed it, but don't know anyone local who's likely to play it much with me, alas.

Played 2-player version decades ago in college, then played 4-player team version at Essen 2008.  Nostalgia!  I want to like this more than I do: having to count up to 20 action points each turn AND remember how many actions each individual unit has spent, possibly while interleaving their actions, is simply cumbersome!  But the bits and map are cool, and I like wargames, and I like combinatorial games, and I like that this game has history, published problems, etc, so I have a soft spot for Conquest.  I am sad I don't know anyone interested in playing it.

This has three sets in it, one set of plastic pieces and one of the metal (pewter?) pieces.

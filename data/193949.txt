Picked this game up on first play, loved it immediately. Feels almost like sins of a solar empire as a board game (one of my all time favorites). I believe my rating will increase as more factions are released.

RATING: 7.5
Fine game that grinds a bit in play speed and interaction early on. It does ramp up later, however, and this makes for some exciting large strokes of strategy and conflict. The galaxy building is brilliant and evokes the feeling of exploration. The warp concept is also really great - allowing you to move quickly across space. In general, it has a throwback feel to the Game Master series from the 80's. On the negative side, the random tiles and encounter flips (albeit really evocative) are uneven at best and this can make for some frustrating moments - especially early on when trying desperately to gain production - the most essential resource. Still, for a light wargame that uses the Star Trek theme very well (the races are well done), this is good fun if you have the time to play it out.

Great 3-player combat/competitive game. Combines world-building with combat. I'm ok with the chance element in the combat. The three races are somewhat imbalanced (at least they seem to be after my few plays) but not severely, and I think necessarily so in order to adhere nice and close to the shows. Long playtime but not ridiculous (5 hrs first play, 3 hrs second play). Overall a great game!

RATING: 3
Too long and too random.  While it did not happen to me, I have seen someone screwed on turn 1 by bad exploration cards.  A bad draw in a 20-30 minute game is tolerable, but for a 4-6 hour game it is intolerable.  Similarly there is a LOT of downtime.  Will not play again despite my being fond of the theme.

RATING: 5
Played with three and also at four with expansions. Basically a faster 4x than Twilight Imperium but unfortunately lacks a lot of the depth. Lots of RNG and die rolling, a player can really get messed over, especially when playing with the borg. Just a bit too simplistic mechanics for its length 3-4 hours.
Enjoy so much the components and exploration deck but itâ€™s missing that Star Trek feeling.

RATING: N/A
4X, Star Trek, Gale Force Nine... this game comes so highly recommended by my peers and really does justice to the entirety of the Star Trek canon without cutting anything out in terms of mechanics and thematic consistency. Despite being a strict three-player game, the community states over and over again that is also compelling as a two-player, head-to-head 4X experience. Regardless, my sister and good friend would happily fill in as dedicated third after my wife and I. We'd all have a blast with this one.

As a lover of Star Trek and 4X games, buttressed with the glowing recommendations by people whose opinions I trust, I'm hard-pressed not to bump this game all the way up on my wishlist.

I like this game a lot. Total Star Trek bias here. I am usually not one for 4x games but the theme gets me there. I like the weight of this 4x. And the asymmetrical nature of it is pretty darn good in my humble opinion. Exploring through space lanes and the disc system is much more satisfying than other 4x tile based games.

RATING: 6
Initial impressions: Played a short game as Klingons. Really like the spatial element of building the galaxy. Exploration was very hit and miss - dice plus cards makes for variety, but can leave the player with a disadvantage in terms of income quite early. There is a definite sense that the 'meat' of the game really lies in the the mid to late game, where large fleet maneuvers and battles take the forefront. This is tricky because the blind technology development also leads to unequal power gain. It's an interesting design and I'd try it again, but so far it's lacking tactical and strategic flexibility compared to similar 4x games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Despite the non-"classic" ships, the design is very appealing in how it depicts expanding space empires and their interaction.  The Cardassian expansion also looks to add an interesting race.  Very excited to play.

Innovative board and exploration mechanics. Beautifully sculpted minis. Very thematic. Each replay a different experience. Unique rules and multiple strategies per faction. Less complex than comparable games such as TI while more interesting and deeper than Eclipse. 

The space lane mechanism really captures the theme and flavor of space faring ships plotting, navigating and transiting between both charted systems and unknown space. Although space is 4D and allows ships to lay a course on a x, y, z axis, most would use known, safe, efficient space lanes. Other games have tried to simulate x/y/z travel but are vastly more complicated (Star Force Alpha Centauri for example).  The mechanics of ST:A are simple, intuitive and engaging (oops). People passing a ST:A game in play almost always stop and make positive comments about how the board looks.

The board grows in an almost organic manner and is different each and every time. 

Bravo Zulu to the designers and artists at GF9 for delivering us another high quality, unique and thematic game. This one is a winner with  depth that reveals itself on each play. 

I saw a copy of it in my local game store yesterday morning but by the end of business it was gone.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: I have to admit, this game took me by surprise. I'm a big fan of the original series and SFC canon but was never thrilled with Next Gen. This game takes place pre-TOS, as the Klingons, Romulans, and Federation make first contact. Surprisingly, the game presents itself well, with simple rules and systems that provide the players with a light 4x game. Decisions are not too difficult, with the toughest being when to forgo the Trade Agreement and launch an all-out attack on your neighbors. The components are nicely produced, with the miniatures representing Next Gen ship models, images and concepts from TOS on the Encounter cards, and player boards representing bridge station panels with button sliders. Overall, very thematic components. One of my favorite innovations is the floating map which can be adjusted as your faction explores the far reaches of space. My one niggle is that I find the game tends to be a bit on the long side of things, my first experience clocking in at just over 5 hours with rules explanation. I'm not sure that I would even attribute this to inexperience as we managed to master the rules within the first 15 minutes of playing. If you have the time, and exactly 3 players, this is definitely a fun game to explore.

The asymmetry of the factions is well done. The exploration phase of the game is great! I love discovering a new planet of unknown phenomenon. Once you encounter the opposition the theme is almost lost and the experience become one of a a war game.

I would love for an exploration based Star Trek to come out, maybe even a co-op on built on an Aeon's End like card game format.

RATING: 6
A pretty good 4X game with Stark Trek theme. Due to the length and the randomness that is typicall for 4X games I would play this only from time to time. As with any game of this style the layout of the map is very important. Also I feel, that the choices are not that hard and the luck of the draw (e.g. Faction technology deck) determines a lot of your decisions.

Likely the "Holy Grail" of Star Trek games. Other than a somewhat long play time (it's short for a 4X) and an awkward player count until expansions come out, there's not much to complain about. The exploration remains fun and exciting on multiple plays, and the player interaction as you build empires and eventually come into conflict is well balanced. Each faction has slightly different rules and tech upgrades which makes them different and enjoyable to play. Looking forward to expansions with other well known Star Trek aliens.

Was expecting to like this, didn't :(

It's a long game with downtime, so it needs to be great - I'm more forgiving of shorter games

Too much chaos with exploration means you can be out the gate in this race game like a rabbit or blocked and hobbled by crisis and bad rolls, add that the plants are pretty varied too. I get a 3 node planet and a nice discovery, you get a one node planet and a harsh crisis, sucks to be you. 

Then there is the snowball effect of culture being so powerful. Finally the inevitable 3 player problem, either 2 go to war third clears up, or two gang up on a third.

Overall not the 4x I was looking foror

This game is fantastic. I have played it about 5 times now and it's certainly fun and unique and brings you into the Trek universe. I suppose it's one fault is length of playing time...we are still learning it, but our games have been 4+ hours. There are a few things that could be described a bit better. So just know that while you learn it, it will be a slow process. I am hoping that picks up as we get used to it, because it would be fun to add the xpacs to allow more than three players.

Played at Gen Con. Fairly fun, strategic game. The warp lanes and building the board is fantastic and fits Star Trek perfectly. There seemed to be a little too much randomness with drawing the planet tiles (some good, some bad), then layering that on with a random encounter card (some good, some bad), which could then get even worse by dice rolling. 

Also, the game seemed to play long: although this was of course due to all 4 players being first-timers, it didn't quite have the "oh yeah this will play way quicker the second time through" feeling that other recent games I've played, like Scythe, have. Lastly, for $100 (even $70-$80 once it hits online stores), and only 3 players, there's no way I would buy this.

RATING: 5
Without any expansions this is a big disappointment. Point to point movement makes little sense in space, where terrain is more or less irelevant. Exploration is fun, but itÂ´s over pretty soon. Many people critizise, that it is too long...I think itÂ´s too short: a 4x game has to be long! After four or five turns, the whole galaxy is explored...that doesnÂ´t make a lot of sense to me. Three or four more turns, and the game is over. Easily played in three to five hours. I want an epic experience in my 4x games, wich this one cannot deliver. Ships are too cheap and there are no building restrictions apart from cost. ItÂ´s easy to hoard money and if thereÂ´s a thread of an invansion, I simply buy 20 ships and place them on a single planet. These things donÂ´t make a lot of sense. 
Three player game is also a problem: As soon as one player will get in the lead, the others will gang up and crush him.
The game has some neat ideas: technologies, fleets, exploration...still without the licence this would be just an average 4x game with a lot of strange design decisions.
Maybe this can be saved with the expansions, although I doubt it.

RATING: 8
The production is awesome. The minis look fantastic. Each ship looks like it's in flight, the fleets look great. The cardboard stock is thick. 
The opaque, poorly written rule book seems to be the only weak aspect of the game production. 

The game itself is largely intuitive. It's a relatively straight forward 4X / civ game. The combat is concise without extraneous complexity or fiddliness. The development of the map and its connections is innovative. The "organic" growth of the discovered galaxy is interesting. Better than the typical hexes of 4X games. 

The game captures the theme of the Star Trek genre very very well. It FEELS like you're developing and living the Star Trek universe. 
One does NOT have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this game, but the experience is certainly enhanced if you're a Trek fan. 

I personally find the THREE player asymmetry to be one if its more interesting aspects. Some of the best games out there are three player games. This would include Three Kingdoms Redux, Maria, God's Playground, and Star Wars Risk Original Trilogy Edition.

Rating after three games is a 7 because the base game is not balanced; as the Federation player is way underpowered.

Update: played with Cardassians and Ferengi expansions. Fantastic to have 5 factions to choose from. Bring on the rest of the ST universe!
Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations!

After release of Ferengi and Cardassians, rating bumped to 8 (rating is 7, +1 adjustment for outstanding theme and components).

Played once. Actually rather a lot to like here - a very tight and streamlined design where little goes to waste. The different empires are very nicely distinct, even better than Eclipse IMO. Nice board-building system.

The downsides are firstly that like every other game in this genre, early luck can be a big deal. Getting good balanced planets for your first few explores can set you up, while bad events can seriously set you back. It's actually a significant improvement over Eclipse in this respect IMO, but it's definitely still there and the tight resources can exacerbate small misjudgements or inexperience (don't run into a Crystalline Entity early with a big fleet). Secondly, Eclipse's mini-turns kept you a bit more engaged than Ascendancy's longer I go-you go turns which lead to more downtime.

I honestly think the limit of 3 players is a good feature, although a 4th would have made the price point more palatable. With 3, it still moves at a decent clip and you get some self-balancing with two players acting to hem in an opponent who gets off to a strong start. The downside is you get some potentially significant kingmaking problems, but I'd need some more play to know how serious that'll end up being.

RATING: 8.1
Amazing 4x game whether you like Star Trek or not. The exploration mechanic is the best of its type with planets that are not stuck in place until connected to at least two others. That, in combination with exploration cards that result in encounters on the planet really add oomph to an element that is often simplistic in these types of games.

Combat is solid and simple, easily resolved. The advancement (technology) system is great. You draw random projects from your factions deck that you slowly work on, similar to projects in Star Wars: Rebellion. I loathe tech trees and this mechanism works so damn well.

The whole game feels really well developed and thoughtful. Downtime and game length are the two biggest drawbacks as some turns can take quite awhile. I really wish turns threaded and players only took one action before turn order passed. Currently players utilized all of their orders and build on their turn, which can take quite a bit. I don't see myself wanting to play this with more than three as the length would be prohibitive.

Otherwise though this game rocks. I'm not even a Trek fan.

If you are a fan of star trek, this game is close to perfection, start with maybe Enterprise for the first few turns, with few resources, nothing known and a lot of guess then becomes the classic series with exploration and first contact, then you are in Next Generation with treaties, diplomacy, conflicts and more.
can wait for Cardassians and the Borg,as indipendent race maybe I'll pass the Ferengi.

RATING: 8
A well-balanced game where some pretty simple mechanics are well-used to create an interesting game. 
Each of the 3 factions in the game are subtly, but significantly, different. This gives thematic advantages (Klingons get bonuses for defeating enemy ships in glorious battle, Federation receive their bonus for exploring new worlds and new civilizations) to each player, but not to the extent that they dictate the way you play.

The game itself falls into 2 stages. There is exploration and colonization to begin with, building up your resources and acting nice to your galactic neighbours. The galaxy you build during this can be different and interesting as most planetary discs you place are accompanied by a random 'exploration' card which creates unique combinations each game.
Once the galaxy has been 'built' it turns towards a more combat orientated game - either to try and score an outright military victory, or to deny resources to your opponents. Although combat is dice-based and therefore involves an element of luck there are ways to turn the odds in your favour, typically by improving your weapons and/or shields.
There is a good tactical element, too, as it is possible to blockade opponents space lanes, forcing them to take a longer route or try and fight through you, and with limited actions per turn it does require a certain amount of planning, both in attack and defence.

Fun game, looking forward to playing it again. Our first game was extremely slow and everyone was unsure of what to do the first couple of turns. In 3.5 hrs we only got through 6 turns and were nowhere close to anyone winning. Part of that problem was that no one read the example first turn in the rule book. That would have sped things up early. (We bought the game at the FLGS and opened and played it right on the spot.)

That said, the rulebook is quite a mess. There are dozens of spots were you find a rule in the front of the book, but then have to jump to the back of the book to read more text about that rule. There are even one or two places where it tells you about something, but then doesn't explain what that thing is, or how it affects the game, until a page or two later. And there's no table of contents or index.

This is a great 4x game that is very thematic and feels fairly balanced despite only currently being a 3-player game. Gameplay is easy to learn, factions have unique abilities and do not play the same. First half of game is more focused on exploration and resource development as players expand and explore the galaxy. Once players begin encountering each other, gameplay changes to a more warfare-centric pace depending on style of play. Game is simply missing more players, needs to be at least a 4 player game, but 5 is ideal.

Such a wasted opportunity for this IP. I don't understand how a company can invest so much into a game and not bother to properly test and develop it.

Since this is an "exploration" game, the best strategy is to pull the best tiles. This level of randomness is forgivable in a game that takes 45 minutes, not in one that takes 5 hours. Not sure the "galaxy-building" mechanic even works as it is meant to, it is so open to abuse. A proper defense in depth is so powerful that it is trivial to hold off the most determined attacker.

The designers did not perform basic math. Prices for weapon and shield upgrades are completely out of whack. You will end up building piles and piles of ships because you have nothing else to do with all the production nodes you will find, while you carefully defend those few critical culture and science nodes.

The rulebook is horrible, and the rules themselves are ill-conceived. The downtime can be brutal, don't even try adding a 4th or 5th player.

A fairly thematic game for Trek fans.  Exploration and resource gathering really give a Trek feel to the game.  Making alliances and trading with your opponents to further your own causes.  A bit too combat heavy sometimes, but there is enough other things to keep the game fresh and interesting. 

The biggest drawback at this point is the lack of player count.  The base game only supports up to 3 players (which is best with 3 by the way, 2 is kind of meh).  There was supposed to be two additional races, the Ferengi and Cardassians, available long ago that would have remedied this problem, but they are going on 1 year of being delayed.

when those expansions come out, along with the upcoming Borg addition to the game, then it will be a much more interesting experience and should raise its play-ability a lot.  Can't wait ot have more players and more race options available.

This game is great if you have a group of 3 people who wants to sit down for a longer game to play. 
In shops its still too expensive compared by what it has to offer materialwise.

I've wanted a Trek-themed grand strategy game since watching DS9 in high school. At first I wasn't excited about this game but after seeing the previews and playing it, I am quite satisfied. Definitely a game you can teach new players in a night and pretty easy to get the hang of. Down time is not as bad as some say. I am very excited to play again and can't wait for more expansions.

I want to like the game because it like the idea of an epic 4x Star Trek game but it feels incomplete to me. Too much relies on luck of the draw. Itâ€™s not the best player who wins, itâ€™s the one who has luckiest draws in system, events and technologies.

I didn't really know what to expect with Ascendancy. I know I was going in with big hopes as it was being touted as a game that finally captures the feeling of the franchise. So let's get out the way the things I liked: I thought the building of the universe was a very nice thing. I liked being able to place words and travel lines and what-not. It didn't totally make sense given how outer space works, but it's easy to overlook given the possibility for a new board every time.  That being said, it's not like any of the planets or phenomenons are really THAT different from each other - so the modular board doesn't have a huge difference of effect.  The component quality is good.  I like the general build-up and focus on Production, Research, and Culture and how those three aspects of the game need to be pursued to achieve your ultimate goal.  Though culture is what wins the game, you can get there faster with production and research.  The tiny little points of asymmetry also work fine and are a big part why this game is being hailed as connecting closely with the source material.  Now the bad parts.  The Exploration cards is such a TERRIBLE mechanic choice.  Random effects for discovering planets is, frankly, stupid and a real old-fashioned way of dealing with discovery.  Yes, discovering new worlds is a random experience in some regards, but mechanically if some players get a bad run of a luck with 'Crisis' Encounters and other players get a good run of luck with "good effect" Encounters, you're going to be a long way away from being able to catch up.  Next: the combat system is sooo lazy!  Dice to resolve combat with basic purchasable and player-specific effects to modify dice.  It's been done sooo many times already! It's like the designers knew they needed a combat system so they came up with the simplest thing possible.  It's not as basic as rolling dice with no modifiers, but it's only the next step up, really.  It's not bad; it's just, it's been done to death and is so not exciting or intriguing.  I could go on with little nitpicky issues with design, but overall the game relies way too much on randomness (random card play, random dice rolls) to make me feel truly involved with the mechanics.  It's a little too repetitive through its 3-hour gameplay to feel like the theme of expansion and development are really coming through.  (Again, all the planets and phenomenon are virtually the same, except for those things decided by random card draws).  Oh well- I don't think Star Trek really lends itself well to traditional board game ideas.  If there was a game really built on the diplomacy of Star Trek, I could possibly see that working.  But otherwise, this one was quite a failure for me.

This is the most the thematic Star Trek game I've ever played. It definitely feels like you're exploring and dealing with bad guys/situations from the shows. It can be really swingy, though, depending on what planets you find and, of course, how well you roll dice. If you don't want to fight this might not be the game for you since two of the three factions are designed to be aggressive.  All in, this is a cool game - particularly if you're a fan of any of the Star Trek shows.

You can definitely tell this is a Gale Force 9 game. Excellent production values with high quality components, but in the end a somewhat random and flawed gaming experience. I love the exploration and map-building but I wish the game made it a bit clearer that you need to aggressively play to your faction's strengths early on or else it just turns into a turtling race and whoever discovers the most culture nodes wins.

I find this game well balanced (both when using the base and base+cardassian/ferengi expansions).

OpiniÃ³ desprÃ©s de una lectura de regles: 4x light. Es guanya controlant 3 planetes natals (el teu + 2 d'altres jugadors) o acumulant un tipus de recurs (Ascendancy). Cada torn es fa: 1) subasta d'ordre de torn, 2) ConstrucciÃ³ + accions en ordre de joc (no alternat) y 3) manteniment.

El fet que no s'alternin les accions no m'agrada gens, un jugador pot construir una flota i atacar sense que puguis reaccionar (a mÃ©s no Ã©s gens temÃ tic). La part d'eXploraciÃ³ (es va construint el taulell sobre la marxa) em sembla interessant, la resta Ã©s poc novedÃ³s: gestiÃ³ de recursos (3 tipus diferents). combat amb daus (impactes a +X) y tecnologia mitjanÃ§ant "projectes" que costen mÃ©s d'un torn d'acabar.

Very good game in general, but really aweseome for the Star trek nerds.
It manages to capture the exploration aswell as the diplomacy involved in the Star Trek universe, while giving those funny moments with it's randomized playing field "The Klingons Colonized Risa again !?" This all comes in an easy to learn Boardgame that doesn't feel overwhelming, yet allows for intricate planning and different strategies.

The downsides are the price tag (mostly because of licensing i guess) and long downtimes (might try to alternate turns after taking an action), but nonetheless a great game for anyone who wants to play something akin to Twilight Imperium with more exploration and less playing time.

I love Star Trek. I love exploration and engine building. I love player interaction. I love ascendancy! This game does everything that I expect it to...with style.  The board building mechanic is brilliant and thematic, the exploration deck adds variability and tension, the research mechanic allows each player to shape their own destiny, the combat mechanic makes for risky decisions, the trade agreements and contact rules make great player interaction...just a great game.
  It's not perfect..if non-deterministic combat bothers you-look elsewhere. If uncertainty in the way the board develops thru planet draws and the exploration deck is a "flaw"-look elsewhere. If the ability of other players to disrupt your plans or hurt your engine makes you want to commit hari kari- look elsewhere. 
  None of that bothers me, I LOVE it.

Observed at GenCon 2016. At that time, only three factions were available for play. While the Klingons, Federation, and Romulans were plainly built upon war, diplomacy, and science, it raises the question if the makers will be able to expand the game in a positive fashion to accommodateâ€‹ more players as they've mentioned. Mechanics of movement were deep, and the ability to truly explore in a more than modular board is refreshing.

Each game I play, the more I respect how the game is balanced. There is lots of die rolling, but any good player should be able to compensate for bad luck by reading the state of the galaxy, adjusting their strategy accordingly, and employing some clever diplomacy. Just predicting who is poised to win first, and plotting how to tip that balance of power without opening yourself up to attack, can be fascinating. The downtime is the only real complaint I have, but if you spend that time planning your next turn it actually paces pretty well. It's also not the best game for those with analysis-paralysis or those who get emotional when they are attacked. Play it instead to enjoy the thematic elements (rather than playing flawless turns) and to enjoy observing how the balance of power ebbs and flows (rather than fretting when not yourself winning).

A very good game, which does not rare mix factions, as in the star trek attack wing, where they mix Cardasians with the domain, just because in a few episodes were allies.

To those of us who liked the franchise before it was totally spoiled by JJ, we liked the pure star trek features, not the kirk star trek mixed with the new, and forced rare mix of factions. There are people who want to play as Borg, as Ferengi, as Romulan, as Cardassian, as Gorn, as Breen, etc. And not to strange soups that undermine the consistency of this universe.

Ok so Trek 4x. Here's the deal. The underlying game works just fine. It is definitely on the more approachable, lighter-side of the 4x pool but that was the intention. 

On the pros side, I really like the exploration with the space lanes, floating planets, hazards, and exploration cards. It is a really cool twist on the expanding map. Too a lesser extent is the hegemony concept. I wish it was more fully developed here but again I get the desire to make it simple and approachable. 

The rest is fairly typixal 4X stuff with the Trek theme added for flavor. Not bad. Not great. Definitely lighter. The victory conditions are rather generic and don't really differ between factions. There is some asymmetry with the advancement cards and faction limitations (Federation can't invade, Klingons can't retreat, etc) but other than that the sides are basically identical in both goals and execution.

A 4x game with perhaps an excessive amount of luck for my tastes.  Exploration can be insanely hazardous or wildly lucky - something many other 4x games have tried to tone down over the last few years.  The Hegemony action is similarly swingy, with a lucky Hegemony roll paying off incredible dividends - I would have liked a more methodical approach to Hegemony actions which required more time and less luck.  By contrast, planetary invasion seemed foolish to bother with, which is unfortunate when it is supposed to be a Klingon strength.  The weapon and shield modifiers seemed too strong for the d6 the game is built around.

RATING: 7
Rating has fallen from 9 to 7 for me for this one, and 6 might actually better reflect my current (5/2017) mood regarding it. Part of the problem is the out-of-the-box 3p and the largely unmitigated 2-vs-1 problem that plagues most 3p direct conflict games. But even if there were four factions, which I believe would help, I think this one might just be fairly critically flawed. It'd maybe be fine if it were a straight-up conflict game, but it has the patina of a galactic civ game that just doesn't seem to pan out. Played at the speed the designers seemed to have anticipated, the focus becomes culture and combat heavy very quickly, and whatever sorta cool exploration dynamics take second place. Building culture nodes is critical yet puts a clear target on one's back (and whether you can build culture or no is heavily affected by system-disc draw). I imagine science research was meant to be coequal with production and culture, but given the heavy emphasis on culture (essential to one path to victory), science-related tech improvements--maybe particularly weapons and shields related--seem overcosted. (I've yet, with two groups--admittedly, only three plays--to see anyone go for anything more than 4+ weapons and no shields boost, and you pretty much have to pop for the 4+ weapons since the switch from [unadjusted] 1/3 success chance to 1/2 success chance is huge.) Making shields cost more than weapons to improve speeds things up, I suppose, for better or worse. Player ship/fleet positioning mistakes or lucky/hyperaggressive lane/system placements on the part of opponents seem very hard to recover from--again, maybe it's intentional as a way to speed play, but once you're on a downward slide, it seems a well-greased one, leading to possible player elimination and someone on the sidelines. (This is not [entirely] sour grapes; I confess to some shoddy play.) Despite the nods to Trek, the theme seems rather thin, particularly for GF9, which has excelled heretofore at meshing theme and mechanics. To be clear, I don't object to the warfare scenario, although I do wish that fewer of the many modern reinterpretations of Trek didn't seem to crave a General War-type setting, but there's just not that much Trek there other than easily passed over Exploration text and some power asymmetries that sort of align. Overall, I'd say there are better approaches to civ/4x, and there are better Trek implementations. (Though not of the same type, Fleet Captains, from Wizkids, is much more effective, in my opinion, at evoking Trek and avoiding constraining players into what seems usually to require an aggressive war footing.)

This is the game is insanely dynamic and requires you to pay attention to all areas of the game, and it feels like you are in the Star Trek Universe.

The bad, the box doesn't have enough ships and control nodes (reinforcement packs available), the box is really bad for storage (moved to INIT gear folio pretty fast),  GF9  they were outrageously late with expansions.

Boldly go where no one has gone before. In Star Trek: Ascendancy â€” a board game of exploration, expansion and conflict between the United Federation of Planets, the Klingon Empire, and the Romulan Star Empire â€” you control the great civilizations of the Galaxy, striking out from your home worlds to expand your influence and grow your civilization. Will you journey for peace and exploration, or will you travel the path of conquest and exploitation? Command starships, establish space lanes, construct starbases, and bring other systems under your banner. With more than 200 plastic miniatures and 30 star systems representing some of the Star Trek galaxy's most notable planets and locations, Star Trek: Ascendancy puts the fate of the galaxy in your hands.

The great unknown lies before you; with every turn is a new adventure as your ships explore new space systems, encounter new life forms and new civilizations, make wondrous discoveries, and face challenging obstacles, all drawn from the vast fifty year history of Star Trek. Will you brave the hazards of Rura Penthe to harvest vital resources, race to develop Sherman's Planet before your rivals stake their claim, or explore the mysteries of the Mutara Nebula on an ever-growing, adaptive map of the galaxy. With an infinite combination of planets and interstellar phenomena, no two games of Star Trek: Ascendancy will ever play the same!

RATING: 6
A couple thoughts after one play that came up later (I sold my copy of the game). I was disappointed with the way technology was implemented - there has to be a better way to involve technology that doesn't involve a snail's pace in a game where much of the tech resources go towards attack/defense in a game that doesn't exactly involve a huge number of rounds either. I might have held off and acquired the expansions if they hadn't been held up forever, but I don't see myself getting it back to the table so off it went. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

The game is relatively easy to teach/learn/play. The challenge is in the different factions/abilities/techs and timing your strike to go for the win at the right time. Box is really huge for what is in the box, but I expect future expansions will fill it up over time. I don't know that I'd ever want to play with more than 3 players though due to time commitment and down time when other people are taking their turns. Our learning game took just over 4 hours including rules. The map building part of the game is quite clever - and allows for some fancy maneuvering and back door attacks if one isn't paying attention. There is also the tension between agreeing to trade agreements and knowing when to break them - it is particularly annoying as the Romulans since when they make a trade agreement, they don't get to benefit from the treaty the first round meaning they could be betrayed and never receive any benefit while the other player benefited once or twice. There definitely are aspects of kingmaking - bound to happen in this type of game although I didn't think too much about it in my learning game. There is definitely luck of the draw in the exploration planets and cards but that fits the theme well - but it does mean some will benefit more than others.

This was an awesome game! I got to play as Klingon Empire. I wish that could have upgraded my weapons and shields with a different resource besides research as it seems hard to come by for the Klingons but that's just if I had my way.

Probably one of the best low player count 4x games I have ever played.  You are trying to expand research, production and culture.  You are trying to get to 5 culture tokens or take over all other home systems.  You explore planets and try to develop them.  Combat is very much like A&A, you get dice equal to the number of you ships.  

The game is fun.  But it will suffer from lucky dice.  I ended up winning my first game due to insanely good dice early when it really counted.  

I still think Fleet Captains is the quintessential Star Trek game.

Excellent 4x game although I feel the eXterminate in a 3 player game is a bit unbalanced as the player that eludes conflict can easily get away and reach ascendancy.

It hits a sweet spot between sweaty and casual. It will take you about an hour per player plus another hour if people are new to the game. So definitely a weekend afternoon or evening at home kind of game. 

The lore is great. They do a great job giving each race their own feel from the shows even though the basics are the same for each race starting out. Each race has their own tech to research, which really helps differentiate them. And the penalties/weaknesses for each species fit just as well as the strengths.

I managed to play through a few games. And I have played all of the factions except for the Ferengi. All I can say is that we have become very conservative with our systems. We try to prevent building ship into other systems as we do not want to start fighting so early before we can build ourselves up. It makes it a very long game and difficult to put planets on the game mat. However, when it becomes necessary to either attack or to create an alliance, it becomes very messy. We do not play often as we have to plan a full day to play which is real fun when we do. I am currently waiting for the Borg expansion which will arrive soon. But this will make things a little more interesting for sure.

After only 2 plays. The game has a lot of promise but some under developed ideas leave it a bit shy of its potential. 

1st the map building is neat, but in the end impulse movement is so rare that the lengths of the space lanes really don't matter at all. 

2nd the turn structure sucks. Having each player do all their actions and sit around watching is old school to the point of being dumb. Why not build and interleave actions? the bidding for turns would not be so important, but we never bid until fairly late in the game anyway and by that point the spending of resources on the bid didn't impact anyone's economy. 

3rd The bidding process itself is not interesting. player one has to set the tone and often it doesn't matter enough to bother. Maybe player 3 gets a cheap pick at the end, but really this could be just a regular bid system that goes until 2 people pass in a row. 

4th Combat, I love dice combat, but with one ship type and the shield/gun upgrades being so simple its often a forgone conclusion as to who wins. there is no tactics to the combat what so ever and this is a missed opportunity. 

5th it also bothers me that in a game where you are playing to essentially 5 VP that everyone start with one. Also having to hold the condition until the end of turn makes it often a case of 2 players going out of the way to stop one player, then switching to have the other 2 players go out of the way to stop the next guy... repeat. A 3rd Victory condition would be nice

Great fun! My rating reflects the game with more than three players. This is one of the best multiplayer negotiation games to come along in a long while.

The components are great and the map grows in an interesting fashion. A play mat enhances this nicely!

Be sure to try the full game with all advanced rules (including "Humble Beginnings").

The Borg expansion looks awesome!

Variants used: Quick start with one extra fully developed planet and 3 research on a technology card (always draw 3 choose one). Research is hidden until completed. 
One extra ascension point gained per opponent homeworld you control at the end of the round. You must be in control of your own homeworld in order to gain this point.

Played at GenCon 2016. When I was playing my turn, I was definitely having a good time, but downtime between turns is excessive (15-20 minutes between turns.) Game lists at 1 hour per player game plays much longer. Would have been better if all players could play phases together. Would improve with repeat plays, def want to gove this one another chance.

It's a fun game that absolutely captures the feel of Star Trek, but it feels like it needed more playtesting.  Tremendously luck-driven mechanics and a game that plays too long for only 3 players makes it one that won't hit the table often for us.  The rulebook needs a new version and might help clear up all the confusion seen in the forums regarding how to play.  I really want to love it.  As it is, I like it.

Great space grand strategy game.  Exploration is very fun - more fun than Eclipse or other games where you just turn over a tile and see a star system.  Combat is simpler than Twilight Imperium 3.  Positional play of using the star lanes to delay your opponent adds depth to combat that isn't present in either.  I lost the game I played, but still enjoyed it as the game remained close (in terms of win conditions), and at the end of it, I felt like I had built a space empire.  

All the random events you get when you explore correspond to Star Trek episodes, so the theme and tie-in to Star Trek is very strong.  But, I think that non-Star Trek fans would probably still enjoy the game for its strategic elements and random events.

RATING: 6
I think I'm done with this game. I so wanted to like this because of how big of a Trekkie I am, but I just found the game to be so full of holes that it started to wear on me after awhile. The exploration and turn structure both work really well, but the upgrades feel really half-baked, the combat isn't all that unique, and the lack of more races is really noticeable. I realize that they're coming, but this does not play well with only three races, and it shouldn't have been released this way. Not only all that, but this was supposed to be Star Trek from the time warp drive was discovered up through Deep Space Nine in the timeline. I guess it fits that description abstractly, but it doesn't feel that way. There's only one type of ship, and the upgrades aren't substantial enough to make a difference. I will say, however, that this is a great gateway game to 4x-style games. I think that Empires of the Void still gives me the perfect balance between combat and diplomatic strategies, however, which is why I've decided to get rid of this. I think that this is the closest thing I've played to being Star Trek in a box (Except for the old adventure game from the mid to late 80's), but it's a little too abstracted for my tastes.

RATING: 7
I'm a big star trek fan, so I'll be up front about being biased.  I enjoy this game a lot, there's a lot you can do.  I appreciate that it's about playing a whole race, not just one ship and one crew.  The only downside is that it can get a bit reliant (see what I did there) on luck, I was playing the Federation and kept flipping non habitable planets and was just kind of stuck exploring for ways to get my engine going while everyone else was conquering the galaxy.  Still want more plays.

Great for the Star Trek fan, especially with the 50th anniversary cards
Game plays long, and 3 player min/max can be constraining.

A really satisfying game.

RATING: 8.5
I loved this game. I know a lot of people complain about the early game being random and luck based off what you explore but its space. One of the issues I have with the game is the fact that its only 3 players. So a war between 2 players could possible win the game for the player who sat out the war. Hopefully they can add more players with more races. I do think the Ascendancy victory condition is a little to easy to achieve. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A highly thematic 3 player strategy game set in the Star Trek universe that lets you play as the Federation, Klingons, or Romulans and attempt to rule the galaxy by accumulating enough "Ascendancy."

The only real downsides are the long playtime (which is upwards of 3 hours at the least) and the inherent randomness of the galaxy as you build it. Regarding the last point, getting good planets in your first couple of explorations can really make or break your chance of winning if it is substantially better/worse than your opponents'.

I'm a Star Trek fan, so the game is very stimulating. Probably as a three player game it is difficult to balance if 2 player work against you or if they don't interact enough.
Exploration is a very brief phase of the game, after that you need to combat to preserve your species. About the lag time, that I have read in other comments, it depends on the time your adversaries take to use theyr commands. It is non recomended to play with sluggish opponents :) Overrall my friends and I have had a very positive game experience

So I've played it once, and I can tell that I am going to like this if for no other reason than it captures the feeling of the show well. However, I can't help but feel that the pacing is pretty bad. Downtime between turns is huge, and the swings between turns are similarly huge due to the fact that players in turn order get to build and play their entire turn before anyone else can build. I guess if you get owned in an invasion because you weren't able to build ships and defenses in time, you should have bid more to be earlier in turn order.

I can't wait to try this! Going to wait for the perfect group and occasion to optimize the chance of having a good experience.

The rulebook is a bit of a mess. A bit long for what it is. Unfortunate it allows for player elimination. And, its quite possible for a player to be crushed early -- by random encounters/planets, or other players -- and them be stuck in a game with no hope for hours.

This one is tricky. I do have fun playing the game, but every time I play at least one player is screwed over by some totally random element.

This is a fun empire building game that feels  like Star Trek.  I enjoyed building the system of planets.  There  is a bit of down time between turns as each player has a lot to do.  We also felt  that it took a lot of time and effort to build research projects that may be better spent to just upgrade your shields and weapons.  Maybe my opinion of that will change after more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I quite enjoyed my play of this, although a good part of that is because I really do love Star Trek, and so the theme alone helps keep any complaints I have at bay. 

Unfortunately I think Eclipse does most of what Ascendancy does, but does it a bit better. It's a tighter, smarter design that appeals more to my long term planning and Euro loving self. 

But Ascendancy has it's own pretty smart and interesting systems that aren't all that different from Eclipse, and as such is quite enjoyable. I think Ascendancy has a bit more negotiation and also trusts its players to help self balance things out a bit more. This is either a good or bad thing, personally I'm fairly neutral on it. 

I'll be happy to spend an afternoon playing this again. Ascendancy may not be the best space 4x game I know, but it may be the best Star Trek game I know, and for me that's enough to make me want to play it occasionally.

If you love Star Trek, or if you love a cool exploration, fantasy, adventure, economy/battle game, this is a must-have! 

Pros:
- It's like being in the movie and living it, if you are a Trekkie fan, you've gotta love how much of the stories from the movies are put into the game and how they connect. 
- Enhanced exploration experience, similar to what the Enterprise was doing in the movies, it's an amazing experience to wonder where you will land next.
- Great fantasy adventure game where you actually read the stuff that is printed on the cards, not just read a number and act on it. The Star Trek graphics is also pretty cool.
- I like that the economy part is pretty simple and yet it's the key to winning the game, you have to plan ahead a few steps.
- The battle system is pretty straightforward, it's not hard to understand yet complex enough not to get bored. The technologies you research make a difference if you select the right ones, so there's a minor deck building involved too. Sure, it's no Twilight Imperium but I can play this with my girlfriend and she loves it. ;)
- The races have the same winning goal but still, their unique traits make the gameplay quite different. You don't get just a +2 at something or -3 at something else, you get completely new special rules that really influence your behaviour in the game. So if you like to play aggressive, you can be a Klingon, if you like to be cautious and do research, you can be a Romulan and of course, if you're peaceful and don't like much to fight, play with the Federation and leave all your fleets on your home planet (and also get the 5 - research card). 
- The game is replayable on an infinite number of games and you will never get bored because of the diversity of the stuff (events, races, etc) that is in the game.
- Diplomacy is an important factor in the game, there are definitely some politics involved and I love that you can play a friendly game where everybody keeps quiet till the end of the game or a brutal military one, it's all up to you.

Cons:
- The game is lengthy and sometimes you can overthink things, you'll never finish it under 2-3 hours in 2 players and under 3 hours in 3 players. There are however rules for fast mode and the game is quite balanced like that as well (only if you have the extensions be careful that the starting research cards have the same power, the races in the extensions may not have 5 points - research card).
- Some of the advancement cards seem useless, I think they could have come up with better ideas to integrate into the game mechanics but even so, those could count as traps for players.

Most overlooked: Military win :D, yes it can happen, especially with the Klingons.

RATING: 6.5
I dislike most 4x games for their massive over reliance on randomness, and Ascendancy is no stranger to chucking fistfuls of dice and wildly random card draws.
And yet... unlike Eclipse or TI, I actually ended up enjoying my time with Ascendancy. 

I love the way that sending ships into warp is handled, and the racial powers are the perfect union between theme and mechanical asymmetry. 
Most importantly of all, when the game was over I felt like we had told an epic story.  The Star Trek universe came to life on our table in a way few other games manage to evoke.

Nice space wargame in the Ã  Star Trek Universe. Like it a bit better as a 5-player game, though the bash the leader and king-making elements were still present - I don't know that they can be avoided in any multiplayer game with conflict really.  The three player count is a bit tricky. Waiting for the expansions that will make it a four or even five player games. More manageable than Twilight Imperium. Happy to make it my main 4x space opera game, along with the more zoomed up Star Fleet Captains.

The best 4x game I've played. It's remarkable how much oomph it manages from a fairly straightforward rules set. There's no fat in this design, with all you'd want in development, research, exploration, and combat covered with a system that is brisk and doesn't require a lot of rules look-ups. 

The sides are nicely differentiated, between the different fleet abilities, special empire traits, and technology projects. Exploration is fantastic, with a variety of systems and civilisations to uncover. The game develops a really satisfying arc, from early exploration and development, to tentative first contact, to full out war between huge fleets. And the ascendancy victory conditions act as a natural timer to ensure the game doesn't overstay its welcome.

The flexible system placement does take a bit to get your head around. But it works well in practice. The open-table setup is a  hassle, so I'll probably end up getting the play mat. Be aware that you need a lot of table space for this as well.

this game is like if tiny epic galaxies were a war game. you can expect to add an hour to play time for looking things up in the manual the first two games. early exploration (before shields) is pure dumb luck. combat is often rotten luck leading to the third player simply running away with the game. tip 1 -- consider locking planets facing away from the group. tip 2 -- instead of building many nodes, consider science fleets and shields to vacuum up anomalous research. tip 3 -- with high shields you can leave single ships out like speed bumps to drastically slow invasions. tip 4 (house rule) -- if one player is visibly excited to play the klingon faction, then have the romulans roll one die and the federation roll two dice: player with highest single die face can claim to have won that particular game of Ascendancy. proceed to explain the nuances of (and downsides to) "KINGMAKING" IN A FOUR HOUR GAME.

12.11.16 - (1 play) This was a good game, but I'd probably prefer playing something like Nexus Ops that is a bit simpler. The variable player powers weren't easy to keep up with especially as I didn't have a very good grasp of the rules on my first play. Also one player got a relatively easy win while the other two duked it out. All of this would likely work itself out with multiple plays but the game really didn't leave me wanting more.

What detracts from an otherwise fine game is that the map essentially becomes a point-to-point affair, with single "roads" (i.e. space lanes) and resulting choke points which are terribly unthematic for a game set in the vastness of space.   I expect such geography in terrestrial war games, or from a game with battles along ancient roads like Genesis:  Empires and Kingdoms of the Ancient Middle East, but not a game where space is the final frontier.

Want to love it. First few games it's brilliant
After repeated plays it has issues, mostly with timing
Research is too slow (and many projects are poor), culture is too fast
Lazy victory conditions
Too much randomness with almost every mechanic
There's really nothing at all in this game you haven't seen done better somewhere else
The number of people trying desperately to 'fix it' on BGG shows that it doesn't work very well out of the box, and disappointment runs rampant throughout the forum

I had originally planned to get the expansions and trust that they might fix it, but I'm not convinced that's possible short of large overhauls to the core mechanics.
After another play it's been sold. Just not good enough to take up shelf space and gaming time.

WoW! Great game. Must have if you're a trekki! In fact, it's a fun 4x game, even if you're not a trekki!

This does a really good job of making the different factions feel unique.  I also really like the way that the map is constructed as you play.  My only complaint is that you can get screwed by random draws at times.

RATING: 7.5
This is a relatively streamlined 4x in space game that borrows elements from Clash of Cultures, Twilight Imperium and, apparently, 4000 A.D. (never played that one, but was told there was a similarity).  It's good, but it's a long enough game that I think I would usually rather play Eclipse or Twilight Imperium.

One aspect I quite enjoyed was how exploration works, though it gets a bit fiddly as the star system starts to get crowded.  I also liked how simple tech advancements and combat are.  Very easy to grasp.

Movement seems a bit wonky.  Warp becomes so easy and powerful early on in the game that impulse mode seems pretty useless, which then makes the different length of space lanes a bit of an unnecessary complication.

Thematically, I'm a bit surprised that it feels so generic.  The Trekkiness of it didn't really shine through, which is unusual when you consider the pedigree of Gale Force Nine.  I thought the Trek theme came through much stronger in Star Trek Panic, actually.

For Star Trek's 50th birthday, how could I not write about this? Basically, this is Star Trek done right. Also 4X done right. Also â€” look, it's just done right, okay?

There are several positives about the game: the components are excellent, the rulebook clear, the placing of systems and space lanes and how they may change, and the warp movement.  Unfortunately, despite some innovations, most of the game are rehashed 4X mechanics that do *not* work: player elimination (exacerbated by the three player requirement), long player downtime, very much and large randomness, factions whose benefits are valuable at different stages of the game, etc.  In our first play through, the Romulan player built a six-ship war fleet and reached the Federation by turn three.  Because of random turn order and systems, the Fed player had gone first, third and then (was slated for) third.  We stopped playing because there was nothing different the Fed could have done, yet that player only had one turn to pursue his own intiatives and was going to spend what little time he was left in the game as a punching bag.  Not fun.  So, we spent more time learning the rules and setting up than we did playing.
On a final note, the game does *not* feel like Star Trek: the Romulans are best played as warmongers instead of subtly, almost all combat is between fleets / multi-ship formations despite that being rare in the source material, the economies are not diverse again despite the source material, exploration is a flavorless die roll with the downside being destruction and the upside being gaining some assets, yet again, unlike the source material...
This game cost 100 USD yet it is not worth it.  We likely will never play it again since we have Fleet Captains and The ST Deck Building Game, both of which very much capture the essence of Star Trek.  Hell, even Star Trek Attack Wing pays much more attention to the source material (albeit combat oriented) than the very, very disappointing Star Trek Ascendancy.

RATING: 6
I would rate this a 7 or 8, based on the quality of game play...but the length of the game is killer. We had a game go for 9 hours, and super long game play sessions of one single game play really isn't my wheelhouse of interest.

RATING: 2
Player elimination? Check. Sprawling fiddly board? Check. Beat up on the leader to ensure an indefinitely but always long game duration? Check. Wildly swinging luck with single dies determining combat? Check. Pound your opponents and take their stuff? Check. Many of the features I despise in one game.

This is a 4x game I can get my wife and more casual gaming friends to play. We really like this one. Used to be a solid 10 for me, but after playing some games with even just one slow player, the down time can be significant. In addition, having played probably 15 games or more of it, the same patterns/tactics tend to emerge since, unlike say Twilight Imperium, objectives are always the same etc.
Still, exploring is cool and so far every map has had unique challenges and advantages for players. All factions are fun to play and you need to vary your strategy.

The game is VERY long, and with 3 players it always turns into 2 vs 1.  Often the game simply ends because one player buys all 5 ascendancy, which is anti climatic ending.  The first build it is no very interesting, and the combat is heavily skewed toward attacker for Romulans (won both games I played as them because of the first strike).  Overall not going to play again.

Pros:
- Graphical design
- Exploration
- Soul of Star Trek Universe
Cons:
- All game after exploration
- Huge lack of decisions
- Low level of debug
- Large downtime
- ASSymmetry: it's the biggest problem. It doesn't work, has no gameplay sense and almost breaks the game. 

Also, I don't see a reason for this game not to have solo and 2-player variants. I think, it should have a mod, that gives a compensation for attacked players, for gamers who want more desicions and individual thinking. 

The second time we played, we used this homerules:
1. Building phase in player order.
2. After all players have done their Building Phase, players make turns using their Command Tokens. A player can spend 1 or 2 action token at his/her turn and then he/she passes turn to the next player.

There is not so many 3 player games in my opinion, and that one is trying to fill that space. I think it's simple strategy game with some cool mechanism (like moving in space).

I played once and think this game will be better once it is a four player version. The things I liked were that each faction had special abilities, that the board is different every time you play and that there are many different paths to victory. What I didn't like was the pace of the game and that with a three player game the faction that can stay away from conflict has a huge advantage once the other two beat up on each other. I think I will wait until it is a four player game before playing it again even though I am very worried about the pace.

Star Trek is known for its character driven stories and diplomacy-centric philosophy, so the fact that it is a 4X style game feels a little odd. Still, the Federation specifically is tasked not to exploit and often finds itself defending primitive cultures from the onslaughts of the other factions and that seems to do enough to keep it connected to the source material.

Putting the Start Trek stuff aside, just as a Galactic Civilization style game Ascendancy shines. Exploring is a blast, because you build the galaxy as you go, so the board will be different every time you play. Whenever you find a new planet, you draw an encounter card that usually brings a classic Star Trek scenario into the game. The game also rewards the factions for playing to their canon, so the Klingons raid and pillage, the Federation explores and the Romulans focus mostly on science, but are opportunistic warriors when the opportunity presents itself.

Movement is super slick as well. Ships can move under impulse power, which is simple and predictable and allows them to defend against incursion. But the can also use Warp power, which pulls them off the board for a turn or two and then allows them to leap back onto the board many systems away. This makes tracking your opponents very difficult and creates all sorts of strategic considerations when trying to defend your sector of space.

I hope they eventually manage to work in some character based content through expansion, because it is the onlt thing holding me back from declaring this the best Star Trek game that ever was.

RATING: N/A
4X space civ builder between the Federation, Klingon, and Romulan budding empires reaching out into space.  The simplified and more straightforward rules lose some depth and richness of the full 4X fare that is somewhat replenished with the thematic and engaging exploration cards.  The exploration mechanic traveling into empty space is fantastic.  This for me is the hallmark of this game that hopefully others will adopt, follow and evolve.  The old move to an adjacent hex tile and flip it over is getting old.  This, for me, is a way more interesting way to dynamically create a planet system of connected space routes--Love it.  Another interesting twist for me is the invasion action that can create some unintended results.  I do not like that a player performs all of their build and command actions in one turn.  My attention span does not last that long and I have been spoiled by the board gaming transition into faster smaller turns.

Has a lot of promise, but limited to 3 players only. It's not designed well for just 2 and with the delays and unknown release dates of the next two expansions: Ferengi and Cardassians, my interest in playing the game has declined because of these limitations. Gale Force Nine, LLC has offered no reply to updated release dates and even their website isn't updated from a year ago. I am wondering if they've dropped the development of the game or fired the staff assigned to it?

RATING: 6
Good game but has some drawbacks that I think would need to be house-ruled in the future.   The fluid nature of the board as it's being built is pretty awesome.  I like that the components have custom plastic pieces for production/culture/research nodes instead of regular cubes like in Eclipse.  The warp feature is great.  However, I do feel as though it will be better with an additional player or two, and that requires expansions.

A solid, streamlined 4x game with asymmetrical play styles that capture the essence of each Star Trek race. The game provides an epic feel at a much shorter play time than other games in this genre which means it should be able to hit the table more often. The game mechanics are spot on and, while appearing simple, trade mechanics and turn order selection provide interesting strategical choices. This was more than worth the wait. I look forward to upcoming expansions.

Decently designed game. GF9 seems to have learned from their previous games a lot within this one. Game breaks down into stages which move into each other nicely. I.e.:
1) Explore
2) Expand
3) Interact
4) Build Up
5) Dominate

Stages 3-4 do need more work. Culture is too precious a Resource in this game and it is mechanically advised to go for Culture Nodes ASAP when and where able.

Game would encoruage more interaction if the Culture gained from Racial Bonuses was higher, Culture Nodes were rarely (more reason to fight over them), and if advancements could be produced faster instead of feeling tacked on.

I see the reason for why it was designed as such, but I feel it leaves a potentially great game system injured from what it could have been.

Social deduction game along the lines of The Resistance but with actions dictated by dice rolls.  A couple of nice ideas but the dice rolling can skew the game.

Definitely fragile. Would not play at 7 (or 5) again, as I think it's too easy for the A.S.S. team. The dice are pretty random (and now that I think about it, I think I forgot you can re-roll them). Interesting concepts; maybe will try again.

I had a chance to play this at Dice Tower Con V with the designer and his wife. We played it after a couple of rounds of One Night Ultimate Werewolf, so there was already a large group that was in the middle of a social deduction game and we flowed easily from one to the next. As someone who has played ONUW, Resistance, and other social bluffing games to death, it was nice to see an already familiar game concept with some neat twists. It's similar to Resistance in that everyone has a team (the "good blue" and "bad red"), and everyone has a role with a special ability (but everyone can see what role everyone else has), but there's a third factor mixed in there as well, which is the first of this game's twists. Everyone has a health card face down in front of them that tells them if they're healthy, or if they're infected with an alien parasite. Other players can, at certain points during their turn, look at the health cards of other players and see if they're healthy or infected. A player can NEVER see their own, so they need to take others words for it. The blue team wants the person kept in the group, alive, so that they can be "jettisoned" from the ship when it takes off. The red team wants to take it back to earth with them, so they want to keep the infected person a secret. If an infected person dies, the alien hops to another person and the mystery begins all over. Throughout all of this, the clock runs down as the ship gets closer and closer to takeoff. How do we do all of these actions, or know when the ship takes off? That takes us to twist number 2: each turn a player reaches into a bag and takes out a die. They roll it, and it will give them options such as attacking or healing, looking at the health card of the players next to them, looking at the health card of any player, quarantining a player, or rolling the side that gets the ship one step closer to taking off. The game creates a very tense and fun atmosphere, as players try to bluff, lie, accuse, or otherwise convince the others that they're infected (or not) and that they're on the right side (or not). This is not a brain-busting Euro, folks. It's social deduction with some twists, and thus will not be for everyone. But if you're like me and love you some party-style "us vs them," then I seriously recommend checking this out as it becomes available.

RATING: 9
This surprised the hell out of me. I bought it as a more compact alternative to Jäger der Nacht, but it ended up felling far nicer to play.

The overall gameplay uncertainty due to the unreliably game length adds to a lot of frantic accusations at the table, and the only actual issue we could find was that in games with uneven numbers, the red guys were slightly advantaged. Oh also, in 4/5/6 player teams, the Stowaway is best excluded as its effect is far too large. It's fine in large games, though.

Other than that, this provides the same contrast to Werewolf/Resistance as Jäger der Nacht does: random elements and an inability to "solve" the game add to a less strategic but more hectic and lightweight take on social deduction.

Resistance-like social deduction game. I liked that each gets a special power instead of just good or bad, but I didn't think the special abilities were very balanced. I also felt that games were mostly focused on figuring out who was infected and getting to earth to vote; figuring out who's good and bad was kind of an after thought.

RATING: 7
Interesting social deduction game where teams are unknown and you're floundering a bit early. It's about disseminating information and working the social space to obtain your objective. The dice add a nice dose of chaos as control of the situation is tenuous. 

The dice do present a possible lopsided outcome and the occasional weak play, but more often than not they produce interesting decisions and trickle out information at the right speed. 

This one also has a unique tone that separates it from Secret Hitler/Resistance/One Night Ultimate Werewolf. There's actual strategy in how you spend your actions and how information is shared. This means it's not as focused on calling out people's bluffs and reading expressions, although doing so can of course still provide benefit.

I do think including the Stowaway, the only character in the game who doesn't have a special power, was a mistake. Not having a vote does provide an interesting dynamic, but it's simply not fun.

Closest comparison to this one is probably Bloodbound, but it does its own thing and may be worth owning if you're looking for something different or enjoy the Aliens theme.

Played a preview copy at a local game night the designer attended.  I don't know Robert personally, so my review isn't influenced by that.   This was a nice twist on the social deduction/traitor mechanics as seen in other party style games.  We played this a couple of times at the end of the night and had a good time accusing each other of being A.S.S agents and who should get shot in the face.  Both missions were successful but came down to at the wire hunch votes by the group to save the ship and humanity!  

Look forward to getting a copy in a few weeks from CoolStuffInc.

Played this one at Prototype Con and am thrilled to see it published so we can pick up a copy of our own! The added unknown of the dice definitely gave the game a new flavor for this type of social deduction game. A whole new level of bluffing and accusation! Highly recommend!

RATING: 9
A super social deduction game with traitors; it differs from others through dice-rolling to determine what action you can take, and that you can't check whether you yourself are infected. It definitely works better with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a hidden role game in the vein of Bang (the dice game), with a dash of Werewolf or perhaps Secret Hitler flavor. Thematically, it's clearly based on the plot of the movie Aliens, since one player is unknowingly infected with an alien parasite, and there's a faction of players who want to bring it back to Earth. 

I cracked out on it for awhile and played quite a few games - it's fun with at least 5 people, but seems to be best with large groups. 

Very rarely, you will get a game that ends too fast due to the randomness of dice roles, but that isn't a big deal, and it's about the worst thing I can say about it. This should definitely be the next hit in the social deduction genre.

I like that this is hidden role but with probably a couple of ways to win as the traitors (flat out fighting versus stealth). I like the theme a lot. I find it fun and interesting. I've not played it enough with people who 'got it' to really see a great game emerge. I've not seen anywhere near the intensity of other hidden role games. So currently I see this as a solid but not spectacular filler, but hope to change my mind with more playtime/

RATING: 4
I like the concept of this game a lot, but thought it lacked in execution. The dice rolling could work to randomize parts of the game, but due to the dice layout there is a disproportionate amount of rolls that land on parasite scan. 

We have now played 4 games and every time we play there are numerous rounds where the parasite scan is rolled by every player repeatedly or engine startups are rolled. Each time we played we had to make our vote based on very little information and it felt like we were rolling the dice simply to advance turns.

RATING: 6
Burke's Gambit is just another entry in the somewhat crowded genre of social deduction/hidden traitor games but it does have a couple of features I haven't seen before. Most importantly, however, it does give players some actual hard facts to work with. Out of all the smaller hidden traitor games this may be the one that most relies on actual player actions instead of just discussions and negotiations.
And even though some of the "facts" can readily and quite uncontrollably change during the game there do seem to be several avenues to pursue in order to bring the game to the desired outcome, and furthermore this outcome is going to come relatively soon in any case.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is actually a really overlooked hidden role/social deduction game. My biggest complaint is that it can be pretty hard for the A.S.S. players to win. But the dice rolling mechanic and not being able to scan your own parasite card make the game pretty fun. This doesn’t replace other social deduction games for me but it’s a great addition. The name is soooo generic though. Why did they name it this?!?

If you play it too seriously, it can drag a lot because it doesn't, typically, require people to act with the same urgency as the Resistance or Secret Hitler. I suspect that it might be fixable by removing the ability to dock a die and just requiring people to take the action they roll, though that would probably just be frustrating for everyone. 

However, if you play it as a goofy semi-party game where you're willing to do some idiotic things to keep it moving, it can be a lot of fun.

RATING: 5
A nice experiment in implementing dice into these Resistance style games. The dice streamline the decisions somewhat, which may make the game a little more approachable for some. But they can also ruin the experience as well.

The theme is fine, but explaining it without referencing Alien is impossible. "So the good guys want to kill the infected person by pushing him out of the airlock? And the bad guys want to keep the infected person alive?"

It's really kind of stupid how they had the bad players' company initials be A.S.S. Maybe if you were playing with 10 year olds they would find it funny, but it's just annoying, indicative of how the game company perceives its target audience. Like when you watch a movie in the theater and see the previews - you can see what studio executives really think of you by what ads they choose to feed you beforehand.

But in the end, there is no reason to play this instead of Resistance. The main reason I took a chance is because one of my game friends' last name is Burke.

It has a great backstory that's clearly a take on the film Alien, which is a great fit for the game. Unfortunately, the game fell a little flat for us, failing to deliver the traitor element the way we hoped it would. The length of play is perfect, however, and doesn't wear out its welcome.

Social deduction game about being trapped on a ship with someone that's infected with an alien. Kill the infected person and the infection will just spread. Quick, fun, and just another solid entry in this genre of games. Player powers add just the right touch and the die mechanic isn't poorly implemented. Still, not the best in this genre, but a genre I love nonetheless.

07-11-2017 - Played at 3am with Patrick, Eric, Daniel and Brian at DTC 2017 and it was one of the funnest, most epic game experiences ever!  Part of that might be that I was delirious with fatigue and the people I was playing with were so awesome and fun.  I'm not sure this game would carry over to other situations as well generally.  I'll give it an 8 given what it is and the amazing time I had with it.  Not sure I'll ever want to play it again though because it'll never be the same.

Im Spiel gibt es drei Gute und zwei Böse. Die Bösen kennen sich und versuchen den einen Infizierten auf dem Raumschiff auf die Erde zu bringen. Die Guten wollen das verhindern und den Infizierten aus der Luftschleuse schmeißen. Dummerweise weiß niemand, wer der Infizierte ist. Auch derjenige selbst weiß es nicht. Vom Ablauf her würfelt man und führt dann die darauf befindliche Aktion aus, die einen Heilen lässt, Spielerkarten oder Gesundheitskarten anderer Spieler anschauen lässt. Wird 4x das "Energy Dings"-Symbol gewürfelt, ist die Runde vorbei und es wird abgestimmt, wer das Raumschiff durch die Luftschleuse verlassen darf.

RATING: 4
While maybe my views are skewed by the fact I'm not much of a fan of the social deduction genre, I think the best social deduction games reveal or allows induction of partial information fairly early, so people have something to base their actions off of, and the way different people act off that partial information and how people interpret that person's actions in the context of how they normally act adds the social part. When that isn't the case as in Burke's Gambit, there are many rounds of aimlessness, and illogical  "Bob's always the bad guy!"

Another problem with this game are that the end game trigger makes you lose your entire turn. While this does make you sometimes not want to reroll a die even if it probably would give you a better result, overall I find this to be a huge negative.

Character powers are also not as cool as many other social deduction games.

The only real positives I can say about this game is it is short and easy to teach.

Great social deduction game, trying to figure out who wants to protect the parasite, with the extra investigation mechanic of trying to figure out who exactly has the parasite. Most times I've played there's a phase of deducing who has the parasite and who can't be trusted, then if the bad guys are figured out, the game changes to a sudden race to kill the other crew members. Had great fun with family and friends.

RATING: 8
There is a good game here.   I play with a pretty sharp group of engineers and the game we found is not balanced.  Maybe, there is a hidden tactic but the A.S.S. have to play sharp to win or you have to get to earth quickly.  We have been talking about tweaks and I think this game is one rule change from being balanced.  Good game as is if you are ok with the A.S.S crew being in for a challenge.  I love the theme but the bad guys, A.S.S., are at a disadvantage due to more information being public or verifiable than in other games like Avalon and Secret Hitler.  The trust tree the good guys build can build quickly and because how easy to kill people, bad guys have to try to not be to obvious.  Our group has gone with you have to do your second roll and we are thinking about treating each round like a day and at the end of each round people have to turn in a piece of paper of who to kill or hurt.  It is hard for bad guys to kill or hurt people since what they do is all public knowledge. It is a good game.  There is meat here.  It just needs a little salt. Someone, will figure out a variant if balance is important to you.  Great theme. It just needs one more tweak.  A good tweak would make this the best or near for a deduction game. 

The only other thing is the game is broken with 4 plays.  5 is probably similar to a lesser degree.  I wish games didn't promote the game being playable with a game breaking number of players.

BANG! The Space Game. I was hoping for a hidden role game which interwove nicely with Secret Hitler (I prefer SH with odd numbers); but this hasn't quite worked out.

tl;dr: I'm not sure this game works as it should

This is a social hidden trader game where, at the start of the game, no one knows who the infected player is, and the traitor wants that infected player to survive until the end while the other players want him out. Sounds good.
The way you select actions is by taking a die from a bag and rolling it. The result tells you what action to do, but you get to choose on who you do the action. You can also re-roll if you want, except if you roll the 'get closer to earth'. If that is rolled 3 times the game ends.
In our first game the first 3 rolls where that result and the game ended before anyone knew who was what or who was infected. A game shouldn't allow this to be a possible situation.
So we tried again. In this second game someone found out I was infected and that I was the traitor. This was then confirmed by someone else. The only thing I could do to save my chances of winning was to die so the infection would jump to someone else. Then I could win as a dead player. But I never got the rolls to do that, and there was nothing I could do to stop me from losing.
So that sucked for me, but the other players didn't find it very engrossing either.

Burke's Gambit takes several aspects of hidden role / deduction games and mashes them together.  Unfortunately, it chose some of the worst aspects instead of the best.

1) Per usual in social deduction games, there are two teams like in Resistance and Werewolf.  Like those games, the bad guys get the advantage of knowing who is on their team.  But in this case there isn't a significant downside to revealing yourself as a bad guy.  The good guys start with only a marginal advantage (1 or 2 more players are on the good guys team).  But, with the advantage of knowing who is on which team, the bad guys can even the numbers (either by killing good guys themselves, or by good guys killing other good guys) before the good guys have much of a chance to react.  So, instead of the bad guys having to stay in the shadows and use guerrilla tactics like in Resistance and Werewolf, it's more like they wait in ambush and then launch into full combat.

2) A lot of the game revolves around targeting one person to kill.  In the early game it is completely arbitrary.  In the late game, it's not an interested decision.  This borrows from a game like Coup, but unfortunately used the worst part instead of the best (bluffing roles).

3) There is player elimination and you can get totally arbitrarily eliminated before your first turn.  I thought we had evolved beyond this as as a species.

4) The dice feel out of place in this type of game.  Even if you have solved the social deduction, there is a good chance that you will be unable to do anything to act on it because the dice either won't let you attack/heal anyone or you won't get any action at all (if you roll the engine face).  I like the idea of having dice with different faces and the die rolls somewhat restricting/enabling your actions but this implementation just doesn't work.

The one thing I thought was cool - how one person has a parasite and it jumps to a new host if their old host dies - seems almost entirely irrelevant to the game.  Odds are most people will be dead by the end of the game anyway and it won't matter.

Small, fast, fun. That's Burke's Gambit. Want to enjoy Alien or The Thing movie experience in few minutes? Search no longer because you just find the game. And if you just want to have quick fun where player elimination is not a problem because a short time to play (cough, cough, looking at you Bang! and Werewolf!), I can recommend this little gem.

RATING: 6
Fun little hidden-role game. But there are two things I don't like about it:
1. Die rolls determine what you do on your turn. I generally like choosing what I get to do by myself.
2. It seems a bit [i]too[/i] easy to figure out who everybody is and airlock the infected player for the win. 

For this genre, there is still nothing nearly as good as The Resistance: Avalon. Nothing invokes true intrigue and tricky play better than The Resistance: Avalon.

The press-your-luck dice element keeps this hidden role game from taking too long, like some hidden role games can be. This is a bit lighter on the hidden role, and I'd call it more of a casual hidden role. That said, it was fun with my lunch & game group and we could play 2 games in the space of an hour (including time to explain the rules).

1 negative: It's not quite clear when player powers can be used.

A very breakable game. 25% of the time you play this, it will end in a dumb way that you assume you couldn't have expected... but...

Most of the time, you could have expected it, actually.

You just didn't expect everything to go so wrong so fast. 

That's the thing about the dice mechanics in this game - if fate is weird, the whole thing could end instantly on literally any turn. (Though in certain situations this would be almost impossible, statistically... weirder things happen in gaming. You know this.)

The game itself is a lot of fun and highly streamlines the "Resistance Formula", with a lot of new additions that are actually unique, or rare at least. The most exciting one is that the parasite can move between hosts, the whole strategy is about finding it, and you can never scan yourself for it.

You will screw up your first few sessions for the aforementioned reasons, but once you understand its meta-strategy, this is a great, short, clever game that I'll still always choose to play over The Resistance. (Because Resistance sucks.)

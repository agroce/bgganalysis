GAME: Warhammer 40,000 (sixth edition)
RANK: 3076
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Rules read through looks as though they added more depth to the game over fifth.  However, as I moved before I could get a game of sixth in, my Necrons have been in stasis.  That will hopefully soon change.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The marginal improvements to power weapons, etc., are completely undermined by the ridiculous ally rules, the psychic power changes, and reimplementing the horrible vehicle rock/paper/scissors game from third edition by adding flyers.

Actually hard to start a game, let alone finish one. The time and money required is maybe too much nowadays...

Best version to come along in a LONG while. GW made alot of common sense corrections, but still leaves alot of room for monobuild idiocy. and the supplements are off the hook. All said, it still makes for satisfying small games, which is the bulk of my tabletop experience these days.

Many small rule changes from the 5th edition, together they change the flow of the game quite drastically. As always, Warhammer 40k is a time-consuming hobby but the experience of a fullscale tabletop clash is nothing less than fantastic.

RATING: 6.5
Not as much of a fan for 6th Ed.  Allies shenanigans and rules heavily favoring shooty over assault not good.  GW seems to be losing their way.  Becoming way too model and profit centric at the expense of game balance and my willingness to continue to buy models has reached its limit.

This has numerous rules that were intersting and unique thematically, but the codex creep is out of control. Certain armies are insanely over powered and others underpowered. I lost 1500 points of space marines in 2 rounds from Tau fire. That isn't balanced.

Its very good, especially with the 6th edition codexes. good balance but a lot of people take the written rules and twist them. Still excellent and allows smooth gameplay

[q=HiveGod]8 --> 6  I'm at the point now where I'll actively avoid playing this... It's a fine-enough game, no doubt—it's just that I've had my fill.  I've pored over the books, painstakingly painted the armies, handcrafted the terrain, and played the hell out of it with innumerable memorable games, burning through four editions (2nd-5th).  In the end it feels like a middle school crush, a soft spot in my heart that is far superior in concept than actual execution.  It was only ever going to go so far, and it did, and so I am done.[/q]

RATING: N/A
This game feels satisfying, a lot of boardgames offer some form of conflict between your guys and theirs but often come up short. Like with Runewars and Twilight Imperium getting into a conflict is bad for both players involved.

Warhammer is all about engaging in satisfying combat, killing your opponents forces while still focusing on the game objectives.

Sadly I sold my collection because my 40K group fell apart. Its a very big game and that can be hard to keep up with and leads to problems with niche players and money/power gamers.

I've played Malifaux and Anima Tactics, but this is the first larger scale minis game I've tried and it's great. Sort of an expensive start up, but worth it. Lots of fun, and the models look amazing on the table. 

If you've never played a minis game before, look at the Dark Vengeance starter set.

Not as good as fantasy battle as there is just loads of complexity and modifiers even within small groups. Makes my mind boggle. Neat in that fewer minis are needed to play and obviously satisfies the big guns and armour urge.

RATING: 5.5
I really like the universe and the models and all the hobby activities that go with Warhammer 40k, but I just can't enjoy the actual game of it. The preparation takes too much time with all the nitty-gritty of the army list-making, the  ceremony for getting a game going is excessive, and the actual turns are a grind. There is way too high a barrier to fun. I'll admit I haven't played a ton, or with a very wide pool of opponents, but I do think I've played enough to understand that I'm not going to like it in the long run. I really need a simplified, streamlined ruleset to want to play.

I've had this game since late 2nd early 3rd edition, its a great miniatures game. But the pricing has just become ridiculous. They priced me out once and I eventually got back into it, then they priced me out again. 120 dollars for a small codex is beyond a luxury item and just because it's a hardcover, it's insanity.

I'm done until prices become reasonable.

Only played one game of 6th Ed so far but from what I've seen I like most of the changes.  

The snapshot rule is a great edition.  

Close combat is now a little more dangerous for the attacker (which I think is a good thing as close combat has always been far too prominent in 40K, which has always struck me as odd considering it's a futuristic setting where kick ass guns are common).

Flying units seem pretty powerful, although can be a bugger to bring to bear. 

Wound allocation can on occasion be very fiddly now (particularly when assigning wounds from random hits like vehicle explosions).

On the whole, seems really good though.  As usual, the presentation of all the various edition (standard, gamer and collector) are out-standing!

I really enjoy the game of 40K and the whole hobby aspect around it but 40K gets particularly high marks from me because I love the Warhammer fluff.

A lot of improvements over 5th edition. In many ways this edition filled the gaps the game had in prior editions, at least for me. Beautiful rulebook! Can't wait to get the small version of the book, this thing is just massive.

RATING: 7
Not a huge change from 5th but enough subtle changes to make you rethink the structure of your armies and tactics. Beautiful rule book, lots of hobby material and excellent background as usual. 

Each time I play this version I have more fun and games are always quite close, raised my rating.

I enjoy the lore of Warhammer 40k. Moreso, I enjoy the creative aspect of the game, painting miniatures and developing a backstory for a custom army.

I do NOT enjoy the gameplay. I have had very little experience with it, but there are too many variables in it that I find unpleasant. 

A family member wanted me to begin playing with them so I invested a small amount of money on top of what they gave me for free. I have a very limited army.

Now I understand there's a large amount of dedication needed to develop armies for different strategies and point levels (i.e. how many points are allotted to the army in a given game). I feel like having to invest a lot into the hobby to start with is an entry barrier for new players.

I don't like rolling dice for combat. I do not enjoy sitting and waiting for Orks or Imperial Guard to roll 10 dice against my armor saves. I also do not like measuring out movement, as it tends to be subjective among different types of players. Again, it creates waiting time when there are larger armies. There is nothing innately wrong with this type of play, it just isn't for me.

More complex than 5th, some things harken back to 2nd edition days.  Flyers are a nice addition, I think they hit Vehicles/Mech a little to hard with the Nerf bat. But the additions of Flyers/Allies & Fortifications make this for the richest version of 40K since 2nd edition.

RATING: 8
6th edition is really impressing me as an old-school Warhammer player who has recently come back to the game.

Shooting is great, combat is great, and the scenario rules may be some of the best they have ever printed.

I'm having a great time so far!  Definitely check out the new 40K if you haven't already.

Great game!  Presentation wise the Gamers Edition is awesome!  
Game play is fantastic, an improvement on 5th Ed, although it is very much now a shooty game.
Vehicles are generally weaker, except flyers, I love my Dakkajets!
Some people bemoan the game-play, Codex creep, the miniatures or anything just to dig at GW, but personally I love the miniatures and enjoy the randomness of the rules.  And I can still win games with my old Orks.
Basically, I love this game.  WAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!

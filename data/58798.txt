Und wieder ein Beispeil wie man den Zugnahmen Carcassonne versucht auszuschlachten! Wirklich nicht viel neues, hätte auch einen anderen Spielenamen tragen können. Ich hätte es verstanden, wenn da ein reines Kartenspiel entstanden wäre, aber man hat trotzdem noch kleine Brettchen mit Siegpunktleisten usw. Blödsinn! Genauso wie schon Katapult und auch das Glücksrad. Wer sowas braucht, der kauft echt jeden Scheiß. Laßt die Finger davon, sollen die an dem Shc.. Ersticken.

Press-your-luck game with some light memory.  Kinda long for what it is.  Yeah, has nothing at all to do with [b]Carcasssonne[/b].

RATING: N/A
As much as I want to like this one, it is essentially a push-your-luck game - Do I stake claim on points now, or save it for later but it may get taken by someone else. Not really my favorite mechanic. Also, the scoring seems contrived and too much for what it is. If I want to have one push-your-luck game in the collection, this could be it. Very beautiful artwork.

Carcassonne themed card game. Doesn't have anything to do with Carcassonne game mechanics. Here you try to collect points by claiming a row of cards which each player is making by laying cards on the table one by one. You'll have to carefully deside when it is the right time to take the points. More points on the table doesn't necessarily mean they are for you.

Cardcassonne is certainly a unique take on the base game. And by that I mean they aren't really anything alike. In this game you have a push your luck mechanism about placing cards out in a row to try and score the most points. You claim those points by putting a meeple at the end of the card row and hope your opponents cannot beat you out in further rounds. It seemed unique as first but it just didn't play well and felt very klunky. A strange re imagining for a game that was perfect the way ti was.

Nothing to do with Carcassonne, this is a very nice card game in a kind of push your luck style.  Decision is about adding more cards to a lot, or securing a lot already on the table.  Different kinds os scoring spice the game.  Nice art.  Major problem comes from the choice of colors.  Card colors have nothing to do with player colors, but they are the same, just to confuse.  Besides, there is nothing to declare each player's color (as easy as the scoring card, eg).

Press your luck games usually don't have much staying power. This one is no different. It has a nice blend of old mechanics that work well together, but it's a bit luck heavy and chaotic. Not my cup of tea, but will play it on occasion as a filler while waiting for everyone to arrive.

Every now and then, I play a game that really surprises me. Despite having heard from trusted gamers that Cardcassonne is a quality game, the name and appearance made me think it wouldn't be. Having only played once, I can't see I have a fully appreciation for how good or not this game may be. But, it is certainly way better than my expectations. A simple, relatively quick game with some interesting push-your-luck and set-collection scoring. I look forward to more of this game which is staying in my collection.

Better than expected, I wanted to trade this in shrink after my father brought me from his last travel to Germany. But after playing it with my brother's copy I changed my mind and I think it might worth to be kept. It's a fun filler.

People often compares it with Coloretto but I think that's not fair. I need to play it more but after my first impression it reminded me more to a Knizia game rather than Schacht ones.

What a delightful surprise. My initial thought when I heard about this game was.. "pshaaah... c'mon... Carcassonne the card game?!".

This has no relation to Carcassonne what-so-ever, except for the artwork and theme. The game itself is great. It's a beefed up Coloretto (which I love). I ran out and bought this as my wife said, "Valentine's Day is coming up. You are getting me this for Valentine's Day". 
SCORE.

RATING: 7
Rather than the tile-laying and connections of the original, this is about set-collection with a built in 'chicken' element (jump now or hold on for more pints, but taking the risk someone else will jump leaving you with slim pickings).  While it's fairly light the scoring system gives you enough to think about that it remains interesting and, while the linkage to Carcassonne is wafer thin (stretching to the theme only) this is a similar weight of game and also very nicely done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The name "Cardcassonne" is completely about capitalizing on a cash cow, as this game has absolutely nothing to do with Carcassonne.

However, the game on it's own has some merit.  It's basically a game of set collecting with some push your luck thrown in.  It actually reminds me a bit of Coloretto.  You want to make the set you get as good as possible, but if you wait too long someone will snatch it up before you.

This has a similar feel to Coloretto, but without Coloretto's lovely stripped down simplicity. On the other hand, playing cards from a hand of them, along with the multiple types of sets with thier different scoring, all add an extra dimension of strategy and calculation. A nice enough filler, but nothing more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players accumulate sets of cards for points.  The game is played over many mini-hands, where players take turns either playing out a card from their hand, or committing their Carcassonne meeple to a line of cards to claim it.  Points are scored for different sets, using slightly different rules for animals, villagers, etc.  Well executed, tight set collecting game, producing a nice amount of push your luck and angst... do you play a card out and hope the pile comes back around, or take it now?  The Carcassonne packaging is a total paste on ... nothing in common with the other game, other than to get you to look at the box.  Very nice game though.

Another Carcassonne title...well, yes and no, as this card placement and collection game relates to the original only tangentially at best.  It turns out that this one's a very good game where the angst of what card to place, where to place it, and when to take a row causes some solid angst.

RATING: 8
Players want to maximize points by adding their hand of cards to individual rows but face a difficult timing issue when to stake claim to the row before another player does.  

Why the decision to crowbar this into the Carcassonne universe where it has no business?   I have a strong hunch this would have been a much bigger hit if themed appropriately.   

Update: Still enjoying this quite a bit after four plays.  I find the decision of when to claim and where to play my cards inexplicably agonizing.  Bumping rating up.

In spite of its name this game has nothing whatsoever to do with Carcassonne except for the art style. It is, however, a solid game on its own merits. It actually reminds me most of Michael Schacht's Coloretto/Zooloretto games, except with a less rigid corset that amplifies the push-your-luck part a little more.
Whether it's better or worse than the aforementioned games is mostly personal preference, I suspect. I like Coloretto better than Cardcassonne better than Zooleretto because the great basic mechanism gets watered down in that sequence but depending on what you like about the games it might end up the other way around as well.

A very good card game on its own. It doesn't need to have the Carcassonne name to be noticed. The rules are simple and so is the gameplay. Maybe it's not the most sophisticated card game ever but it stands to the expectations awaken by its great predescesor.

This really has nothing to do with Carcassonne except for the name.  I was disappointed to see that the publisher didn't even get Doris Matthäus to do the art, so there's not even a visual connection.

Car(d)cassonne is a simple card game of timing and slowly revealing information.  Players start each round with a hand of five cards.  They take turns playing these cards one by one onto four different rows according to the color of the card.  Once each round, instead of playing a card, a player may place their meeple on one of the rows, laying claim to all the cards played onto that row earlier in the round (and maybe a few left over from last round).  So basically it's a game of chicken.  You want to wait for the row to get juicy enough to be worth taking, but if you make it too juicy someone else might take it before you get your next turn.  If you've played Medina, you know the drill.

It's a very similar game to Coloretto, and I rate it similarly.  The major difference in Car(d)cassonne is that players have some information about what cards will be played later in the round.  But in most cases, the cards must be played in their own colored row (you can break this rule once per round), so you don't have the ability to sabotage a row like you can in Coloretto.

This game hasn't worn off its "newness" with me yet. I still introduce it to new players and it is very simple to teach. Nothing overly exciting about it and not too much strategy, but it's fun for the first few go-arounds. My rating may drop as I play it more because I have a feeling it could get stale.

The exploitative nature of the Carcassone series gets more blatant every year. This uninspiring spin-off is a set-collecting/chicken game that's completely unrelated to the gentle tile game that preceded it. Place a card or grab a set is the only decision in the game. OK, it's not quite as awful as Abbey & Mayor, but that's the best thing you can say about it. For next year, Klaus-Jurgen, could you think of a NEW idea, please?

A clever little game that takes advantage of the Carcassonne brand to give it a viable theme, though the theme is admittedly overused and completely pasted on.

It plays fairly similarly to Coloretto, but the scoring is incremental and rewards careful planning and a bit of risk-taking.  I'm not sure that I understand the use of the bluffing element with the face-down card very well, but hopefully a few more plays will clear that up.

The main problem I have with the game is the fairly complicated scoring system that requires a lot of addition.  Even though it is simple arithmetic, it seems like you need to have one person doing the scoring, since it is very easy to make a mistake, and it's easier to just appoint one person to score aloud, so everyone can verify the calculation.

After reading the rules it felt like a 5, but actually playing it was a positive surprise. Looks are Carcassonnish and the gameplay is somewhat fresh and new. A bit of chaos, tense planning and set collecting aspects create a quite new Carcassonne. The game seems to benefit from having an odd number of players.

Nagyon jó, ötletes játék. Szép kivitelezés. Carcassonne-hoz nem sok köze van, ami nem baj, gondolom a nevet azért érdemes volt felhasználni.
2-en játszva is élvezetes, de ha valaki egy körön belül korán lerakja az emberkéjét, biztosítva valamelyik sort, akkor onnantól kezdve már nincs mit taktikázni. Ennek ellenére is eléggé kiegyenlített a játék, tehát nincsenek behozhatatlan előnyök/hátrányok, de a végén a kincses láda alatti lapok összeszámolása okozhat meglepetéseket. Persze, ha játék közben valaki erre is tud figyelni, akkor nem. ;)

RATING: 6
I actually like this over Coloretto to which it could be easily compared.

LIKES:

* Different types of cards score differently (animals, buildings, people).  The buildings are secret and if you don't pay attention, the other person can collect a bunch of different types and win unexpectedly.
* Tension exists over how far can I develop this row to my benefit before my opponent(s) choose it before I can.
* Easily picked up and learned/taught in 5-10 minutes.
* One can also choose the same row as someone else but you just get the cards between that person's meeple and yours.  This allows for the potential of other rows growing and being unclaimed between rounds.
* Plays much better with 3+ people.  I do NOT recommend two player.

DISLIKES:

* Two player game feels like it takes forever (10 rounds of doing the same thing over and over).  Two player is not this game's sweet spot.
* I don't like the smaller square boxes - they don't really sit on a shelf so well.

One part hand management one part press your luck game. There's actually a semblance of strategy to be found in the order which you play your cards.

Played quickly this is a light fun game that should survive at least a dozen plays. Perhaps it will inspire us to play more but I somehow doubt it's welcome will wear so well.

One final note: I wish Klaus had relied on his name to sell this one. I guess after the poor reception Pompeii received he felt he needed to attach the moniker to see it even though it was entirely unrelated to the original; just like Mr. Friese.

First impression (3 players): I like combination of pushing your luck and hand management here. You're a bit limited in your options at some points as you must play cards to right colored rows but it is reduced a bit by the fact you can place the first card in any row. Not sure if scoring is balanced but I liked it anyway. Reminds me of Coloretto which is a good thing as I like the game a lot but Cardcassonne is a longer game and I like Colorettos simplicity really.

Worked well with 3 players but it feels it might scale well even up to 5.

RATING: 6
Nothing to do with Carcassonne, it's just a simple card game. Cards come in 4 colours and 3 types - people, animals, buildings, plus some specials. A turn is to play a card into its colour row or to claim a colour row, ideally just before it's too tempting for someone else to claim it and after most of the cards in that colour have been played so you don't miss out on them. The other decision is what to play face down at the start of the round - to the row you'd like to claim so as to keep it, or to another row where it's potentially a 10 point bonus for someone else. Score people immediately. Add animals to your collection and score them if you've added to them this round. Stash buildings for end-game scoring. Repeat for 6 rounds / hands. It might be potential filler territory, except it's not engaging enough to generate either laughs or satisfaction. However it's easy to learn and play, pleasant enough, just not a lot to explore.

This is not "Carcassonne: The Card Game".  It's simply a great card game, with some excellent mechanics, that they put the Carcassonne theme on.  I like the timing/press-you-luck element of choosing the right time to claim your cards each round.  I like the strategy that's created by laying down your first card face down.  And I like the different ways each type of card scores.  Great card game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on one play: No similarity in mechanic to Carcassonne. You place cards in row and with one meeple per round (where each player gets to place four cards) you play your meeple to get all the cards in a row already played. Based on what you get, you gain points right away or later on. The scores were very spread out, there is a push your luck element, but with a lot of players, it is kind of a free for all. And since there is no player color indicator, you forget who is what color (no turn maker either, seems they could have included these). A definite pass for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
It's basically set collection and push your luck. Rules could have maybe been written a bit better, but nothing is that difficult. I do worry this is kind of a table hog with more players. The card rows get a bit unwieldy.

It's almost a bit too long for a filler and too light for anything in between. Doesn't really have any relation to Carcassonne besides the theme. Also, points get a bit crazy sometimes. Our first game was like 390 to 385 with 2 players.

The box of Cardcassonne looks like the one of Carcassonne. That is where the similarity ends though. It's a push-your-luck game, in which you have a choice each turn to play a card to one of 4 rows, or claim all cards in a row. There are so many games better than this one, that I don't expect to play this again.

I had low expectations for this one. It doesn't suck that much!

There's a little bit of push-your-luck, a little bit of bluff, and a bit of teasing. The main decision is either to claim a row of cards or to add a card to an existing row. What simplifies this one even more is that you have no choice (except your first card) of which row your card may be placed. So you try to tease your opponents by making a row valuable to them and hopefully distract them from the row you want.

One very annoying thing about this Euro (and ultra-light Euros in general) ... the heaviness of a game should vary directly with the heaviness of the scoring. I don't particularly want to multiply and add all the time for a game this light.

Cardcassonne -- Played once; three-player.

While the main mechanic is drawn from Coloretto, this has an entirely different feel.

Quite enjoyable.

I'm not sure that the prohibition against looking at the cards in your own treasure stack is necessary, but I didn't mind it.

The face-down cards add a nice element of anticipation. Is it an animal? A treasure? A multiplier? Or is it (gasp!) another color?

When a face-down card doesn't match the color of its row, it can be used as normal, or it can award 10 points immediately and be discarded. If that card is a treasure card, it may be worth 10 or even 15 points if used in the treasure stack, otherwise discarding such cards for 10 points seems to be the optimal move. This indicates to me that the designers wanted add some risk to playing face-down cards to rows of another color. By playing a card in such a way, a player risks another player taking that row and gaining 10 points.

Good card 'push your luck' card game with a Carc theme. Actually, meeples and graphics aside, there isn't much of a Carcassonne link.

Players have a hand of card they then play, one card each turn, onto one of four coloured rows. Cards played must match the colour (except for the first card played face down on any row each round).

In lieu of playing a card, players can place their meeple against one of the four rowns to go out that round. They continue to place cards but will only score cards up to where their meeple is placed.

People cards score via multiplication, there are instant 10 point cards, animal cards scored as sets each turn and house cards scored once as sets at the end of the game.

[RGG 2010 edition] {Carcassonne; set-collection; optimal 3-4p} Cardcassonne has nothing to do with the board game.  They are of different mechanics and require different mindsets to play.  It's in the vein of Coloretto, in which players have to decide play a card or take a row.

To win this game, timing is everything in this game.  Cardcassone has more choices and planning than Coloretto, but it's not as tense due to the diversity and amount of cards.  The game is will be even more challenging if some 'disaster' cards are included.  Player interaction is good.  It is a very nice choice as a filler game.

The production quality is very good.  Rulebook is nicely written.  The card are nicely illustrated and colorfully, but the iconology is not intuitive enough.

Cardcassonne is an interesting press-your-luck style card game with a bit of bluffing mixed in.  The rules are quite simple and player choice is what drives the game.

This game scores in a similar fashion to Carcassonne with the exception that you are using cards instead of tiles.  It has a touch of worker placement, but overall its about maximizing the points you score each round.  Definitely doesn't replace Carcassonne.

RATING: 5
I’m notoriously vehement  in my dislike of card and dice game versions of board games, such as Ra: The Dice Game, Samurai: The Card Game, Settlers of Catan Card Game, San Juan, Ticket to Ride Card Game, Caylus Magna Carta, Alhambra Dice Game, and Tigris & Euphrates Card Game, etc. As I’ve said before, I want to play board games, not the stripped down, overly streamlined, neutered versions of those board games. I completely appreciate the fact that designers and publishers want to make money off of known entities with spin-offs, rather than risking an investment in an unknown entity, just as we see happening with movies, books, and television. That is a perfectly rational approach for the designers and publishers to take, but it doesn’t mean we have to purchase the products that result. I do try to go into these “games” with as open a mind as possible, but in the end you tend to find a product that really would not exist in a world where games were designed to be played rather than simply purchased. Cardcassonne it turns out does not quite suffer this same fate because it tracks the trajectory of Power Grid: Factory Manager instead, that being that it really has nothing whatsoever to do with its namesake. Instead it is a reworking of the basic Coloretto mechanic into a game with a light veneer of Carcassonne “theme” and the major difference being that players add cards to the available pools by choosing from their hand rather than drawing from the top of the deck. The scoring is also slightly more complex with three different types of cards (people, animals, buildings) each scoring somewhat differently. It was a fine game, but just as I prefer the purer Coloretto to its offspring Zooloretto, I still prefer Coloretto to Cardcassonne seeing as Schacht’s clever mechanic of adding a card to a pile or taking a pile of cards works best in its original form not mired in extraneous add-ons.

Nothing to do with Carcassonne, rather simple push-your-luck cardgame with a pasted up theme (and Carcassonne connection). One play was enough, sold it.

I'm ambivalent enough about Carcassonne and franchise games enough that I was a little wary about this game overall, but I'm pleased to say that it exceeded my expectations.  Other than the theme, it has very little to do with Carcassonne, and actually feels more like the -loretto games by Michael Schacht than anything related to Carcassonne.  The choices are pretty simple -- play a card or reserve a row -- and there's a neat little timing element to the game, where you have to decide how far to push your luck in getting what you want on one round.  There's also a bluffing element with some face-down cards that you can play to either tempt another players, or to hide away in an effort to take them yourself on a later turn.  The endgame can be a little skewy, since the points you can get for sets of cards seems ridiculously high, but folks with better memories than I will probably not be as surprised by them.  The game doesn't feel groundbreaking or even original, but it's a pleasant little game, regardless.

Not something extraordinary. Small interaction, little to do other than placing one piece.

In Car(d)cassonne, players place their cards in different rows to increase the scoring for that row. Whether in the field, the city, the road or at the abbey, you must ensure that cards placed will earn you more points than your opponents.
\13\ \13\
However, sooner or later, every player has to claim one of these series of cards to get points. If you wait one more turn, there will probably be a greater number of cards in the row. By cons, it is possible that another player take the opportunity! You should be alert in this game stretched to wrenching choices.. Rebuild Carcassonne: one card at a time!

Hey, it wasn't bad.  I don't like Carc much at all and this was actually pretty fun.

A light set-making card game with no connection whatsoever to Carcassonne.  Not unfun.

Tentative rating.  It feels like a simple, suspenseful little hoarding game.  It has nothing mechanically in common with [thing=822][/thing], just to be clear about that.

After 1 play: Like a more complicated but less interesting version of Coloretto.  Loses a point for shamelessly using the Carcassonne name, when it bears no similarity to that game.

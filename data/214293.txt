Without the madness, this would be a rather dull game. And yet the madness element doesn't make the game degenerate into a party game (and there's not many party games I like), although the humour level certainly makes it feel, at times, like it is. Most Lovecraft fans seem to hate the game because there's little horror and much humour; but thematically and artistically (beautiful art, by the way), it's rather faithful to the novella; and it's the only Lovecraft game I know that actually makes a pretty successful attempt at depicting the madness of the corpus. Sure, the madness is funny rather than horrific; but it accurately depicts what happens PRACTICALLY to Lovecraftian characters. And besides: when playing (for example) Arkham Horror, does anyone really feel the madness and terror of encountering a Shoggoth? No.

Having said all that, it's a shame that there's really no time to read the flavour text in-game; and as a result of the time factor, the theme gets somewhat murky.

The decisions which need to be made are at about the same level as Forbidden Island, so don't expect some deep thought exercise here. Play it for fun; and most importantly, PLAY IT WITH THE RIGHT GROUP!!! Lovecraft-is-deep-serious-horrific-art types need not apply; and people who hate chaos can play Agricola, instead. The skill required for Mountains of Madness comes in one's abilities to determine what is wrong with their companions, and how to successfully communicate with the other players in spite of the restrictions imposed by your own madness. If you can't think on your feet, this may not be the game for you.

Fun, and silly, with plenty to talk about in regards to where to take your plane next, what you stand to gain, and when to discard leadership tokens. My issue doesn't lie with the madness cards, I think they're quite fun, but with how winnable the game is based on sheer luck. My group didn't play extremely well, but we did OK and still couldn't find nearly enough relics to meet or surpass our injuries. Need more plays to see how much of the difficulty is strategy and how much is dumb luck.

Good, tense fun for a large group. I love how the madnesses can create situations that are equally zany and frustrating. It might lead to actual confrontation, and, in that way, very accurately simulates fighting for survival.

Played at Essen 2017. A simple coop/party game. If it wasn't for the madness phase it would be just average. But it isn't! The madness phase makes this game a lot of fun. Every player has a madness which takes effect on the timed phase when all players need to communicate about the cards they have. But they are all mad and it's just a big chaos. Someone is shouting someone is mimicking someone else. One guy is only asking questions and another is always answering affirmative. And you have 30sec to decide who puts what cards. It's more often than not a failure. Fun!!

Mountains of Madness is all the fun in a crunchy co-op, with all the zaniness of a party game. As frustrating as the game can be not being able to do or say some things midway through the game, the frustration turns to laughter and even enjoyment. It’s a fun game and I will very often play with a group of friends if they are interested.

Picked this up at GenCon50, for its something different feel, its play is fun. 

Tip: Using envelope address stickers on the blank cards to add some madness options can let you change them time to time.  Just handle them some to wear down the sticking power so they can be removed easier later.

One of the hot titles at Gen Con 2017, this cooperative game is centered around a 30-second window in which players must find a way to work together and complete each revealed goal by playing a certain number of cards from their hand. The problem is that each player has accumulated a certain amount of madness and has to perform certain actions to communicate with other players. This mechanism leads to some very funny and challenging rounds. Obviously this is going to be better played with some close friends rather than strangers at a meetup. I only worry that once players have seen all the madness cards, the game may not be as fun. Hoping for additional cards in the future!

While I would have rated Mountains of Madness a little higher after my first play, my second play let me settle on a 4. I mean, the idea of players becoming mad which makes the real-time part more difficult sounds fun on paper. Guess what, I didn't like it in practise. If it wasn't for the wacky restrictions introduced by the madness cards, the real-time part wouldn't be interesting at all and easy to figure out. In fact, most of the game doesn't have a lot of informed decisions. The selling point here seems to be the gimmick of the madness cards but I don't feel like this idea alone is enough for me. Aside from my unwillingness to touch strange people because a card told me to do so, I don't feel like there is anything else im Mountains of Madness that makes me want to play it again.

This game doesn't deserve the low rating. This is mainly due to the game not meeting expectations I gather. This is more of an advanced social/party game and quite a good one at that. This will gladly replace Mysterium for me which is too light and lacks replayability after a few games. Just be sure to know what kind os game to expect and it'll do fine.

Actually a fairly well done game here where you attempt to overcome various challenges by playing cards whilst also overcoming your own madness (this is cthulhu after all ..we are all mad here) 
Madnesses have quite an impact on the game in that it is a rule you must follow - such as checking under the table for monsters before you are allowed to play cards- and you are not allowed to talk about them so other players must guess at your particular insanity. :D

The challenges you must overcome are fairly standard, place a certain number of cards of certain suits into a check before the timer runs out, however I found a simple joy in the fact the red crates symbol for example would change colour - but not shape- as you travel further up the mountain and further into madness, or its outline would go wibbly wobbly. its a really nice touch.

Was tun mit einem Spiel, dessen Wesenszweck darin besteht im kommunikativen Chaos zu enden? Als kooperatives Spiel getarnt, genügt sich BERGE DES WAHNSINNS darin Spaß am Scheitern zu haben. Das Ziel, den bösen Berg von HP Lovecraft mit dem Märklin-Gedächtnis-Modellflugzeug zu erklimmen, ist nicht wirklich ernsthaft zu erfüllen - weder konkret im Sinne des Wortsinns, noch praktisch im Spieldesign. Zumindest ich kann mir das nicht vorstellen und muss es auch nicht, denn ich bin ja am Spielende dem kompletten Wahnsinn verfallen. Was BERGE DES WAHNSINNS jedoch hervorragend abbildet: wohin permanentes aneinander Vorbeireden, Automatismen und die Gefangenschaft in stereotypen Verhaltensmustern führt - nämlich ins Nichts! Das psychosoziale Problem, welches das Spiel aufgreift und darstellen will, ist gleichzeitig das, womit sich das Spiel natürlich selbst ad absurdum führt. Dies übrigens in ausgezeichneter und vorbildlicher  Materialqualität. Irre, dass sich ausgerechnet ein irres Spiel diesen High-End-Luxus gönnt. Eigentlich ein Partyspiel, aber dafür dann doch wieder zu psychiatrisch. Meine Benotung bitte nicht so ernst nehmen.

Highly enjoyed the first play, my gut feeling is though that this game really shines when you find the new stuff in it. A second play will probably be a lot different. Well designed, the only real complaint is that we felt that you reached a high level of insanity and then you where stuck with that madness. The earlier levels were often funnier.

I feel like it's a unique cooperative game, but you really need the right group for this one to shine. I played it with a mixed group of young and old gamers and non-gamers and we ran out of time A LOT. It was fun, but people kept forgetting their madness and the urge to cheat was very strong. It was hard and yet very silly. I'm not buying this one.

This is a very situational game. You probably already know this if you’re here (I didn’t), but to play this game you are going to have to behave like an imbecile in front of your friends. If that sounds appealing, you’ll love it. If not, find something else. I enjoyed the mechanics of communicating to figure out who had whichever cards within 30 seconds. I didn’t like doing it while having my face petted, and singing out of tune to communicate.

Played a demo of this at GenCon and wasn't all that impressed with it. Somewhat of a mix between a party game and a Euro game with an AT theme. Its an odd mix, and the game doesn't really hold up from what I could tell. I was bored after a round of having to sing when I talked. Each player has a madness that affects how they play the game, but it seems most of them are the things in boardgames people don't like doing most of the time.

Wir decken kooperativ ein Plättchen auf dem Plan nach dem anderen auf. Darauf ist eine jeweilige Aufgabe abgebildet, die mit Handkarten bestanden werden muss.
Innerhalb 30 Sekunden muss abgestimmt werden wer welche und wieviel Karten reinlegt, dabei hat aber jeder Spieler eine Wahnsinnskarte, die er bevolgen muss (sage alles zweimal, schreie, streichle die Person mit der du sprichst, ...).
Die ersten Aufgaben haben wir nicht geschafft. Gegen Ende ging es einfacher, da einer zum Redelsführer "ernannt" wurde, der die Ablage koordiniert. Wenn man das Spiel öfter spielt bin ich überzeugt, dass man ganz gute Punkte rausholen kann.
Mir hat es allerdings nicht so gefallen. Die Wahnsinnskarten sind ganz lustig, aber irgendwann eintönig und manche sogar recht peinlig. Nach dem Spiel haben wir aber dennoch immer wieder an das Spiel erinnert indem einer den anderen gestreichelt hat oder einen Mustache mit seinem Finger gehalten hat...
Witzig, aber ebenfalls nicht mein Spiel, irgendetwas hat gefehlt...

I think like me most people will dislike this game, but for those that it is designed for it could be a real hoot.

If you didn't know this is not some narrative game you might be expecting based on the box cover. Instead, it is basically a real time card playing co-op where madness cards will limit your communication options or make you do weird stuff. Now, it makes sense that a cthulhu town would drive you to do crazy stuff, but here it feels much more silly crazy than the dark crazy (which admittedly I'm not sure how they would implement) the theme normally evokes. Outside its craziness that I thus don't really like the game doesn't really have any legs besides some minor resource management.

However, if such silliness in communication appeals to you you may have a lot of fun with this. There are some cards that are a bit too much (e.g. touching a person's face), but you could easily remove them from their respective decks.

This is a Very Silly Lovecraft game, but that can be a good thing. Is it as dark and foreboding as Fantasy Flight's Arkham series? Not at all. But not everything needs to be that. By structuring the increasing madness as actual hampers on communication, the game is rendered very light, but also pretty good as far as the at-the-table interaction. Would recommend.

Daviau created the perfect way to simulate insanity in a Cthulhu game - give players insanely difficult but still possible tasks for an hour.  Then SOMEHOW, he made it a party game.

RATING: 6.2
Short - It is kinda like someone successfully combined Quelf and Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu and should be approached with the expectation to have fun. 

Long - This is a party game disguised as a co-op H.P. Lovecraft game. At it's heart, it is a communication game where you are trying to climb a mountain and overcome obstacles (represented by tiles) as a group by playing the right combination of symbols (depicted on cards) without going over. BUT there are limitations like a 30-second timer and madness cards that handicap communication in silly ways such as forcing a player to speak as if their tongue was stuck to the roof of their mouth or to hold their hand of cards backwards so only other players can see them. Also, once the first face-down card is thrown into the pile, no one may speak anymore. 

If you are with 3-5 lighthearted friends and looking for a simple, hour-long co-op game that avoids the quarterbacking/alpha-gamer issue in a silly way, this is a sufficient choice.

Not at all the tone you'd expect with the art and the names attached to the game. Would've expected something serious based on looks alone but ended up to be a whacky game of madness with a lot of limitations like yelling all the time, standing 10 feet away, and love the experimentation with playing with card icons and colours the higher up the mountain you go.

I like real-time games. I like co-op games. This could've been good, but the madness cards range from completely ignorable to practically impossible, and the level of the card has nothing to do with it, as if the cards were never play tested. Perhaps the most obnoxious moment I experienced was when I drew a card that forbid me from communicating unless I physically touch the other players. Since the rules state you are not allowed to tell others players about your madness card, this made for some very uncomfortable situations. I recommend playing a similar recebtky released co-op game, Dungeon Time, over this mess.

With timed sections and various wacky restrictions on communication and other interaction, I found this to be mildly innovative. However, as a game I don't think it holds up well. For example, the fact that you're "exploring" a 2D grid is bizarre, and not in a Lovecraftian way: Every round you choose where to go, but the choice is all but meaningless, as you have no information about the places you might go. The only real decision is to choose a path of the appropriate length that you don't lose, but otherwise maximize relics. My overall impression is that the wacky talking restrictions are the only good part of the game, and everything else is mediocre support structures to facilitate that.

1 play, 5er

It was not good! Basic play is simple: everyone gets a bunch of cards each turn. You navigate a series of challenges (revealed when attempted, each demanding some different combination of cards that must be played collectively, face down, within 30 seconds), searching for some number of relics (varies with game difficulty) before escaping the board. The game is a different take on Lovecraftian madness: instead of tracking insanity like every other game in the genre, this game tries to make you FEEL the madness by giving people behavioral/communication challenges (e.g., must start every talking phase by shaking everyone's hands, may only whisper, may not play your cards yourself). Unfortunately, the madness rules (all 3 levels) didn’t seem especially difficult, nor were they very amusing.

I really felt that this game couldn't figure out if it wanted to be serious cooperative game or a party game. It tried to be both and imo failed. Your group tries to complete objective (placing a specific number of cards in the middle) in a specified time frame (~30sec) while dealing with everyone's "madness". The madness all hamper your ability to communicate in some way. This game just wasn't for me. I would have much rather played pandemic and followed that up with Times Up or Telestrations.

A great cooperative and social game. The main feature of the game is player receiving madness cards as they play. These cards range 1 to 3 levels. Often level 1 cards have simple and sometimes silly rules you must follow. While 2 and 3 start making it harder to communicate. 

Much of communication is done with 30 second real time events which usually I'm not a fan of. Yet, the theme mixed with the madness cards makes this a fun and exciting experience. The silliness which can occur sometimes doesn't fit the theme but it fits the idea of becoming insane. It is silliness with a purpose.

Cooperative game. Try to escape the mountain before going too mad. Madness cards include some party game elements and in general make the communication in missions more difficult.

Well then. This game "didn't know if it was a bird or a fish", as the Finnish saying goes. It looks like a serious Eldritch/Arkham horror game but the gameplay is just card playing with a goofy timer section where everyone plays out their "madness" gimmicks. One time fun, I'll prob never play it again. Also there's just way too few madness cards, the game will have next to none replayability. This should have had funny, tongue-in-cheek art style and look in my opinion. Kudos for doing something different but sadly, 'tis a miss.

Fun group coop game. Despite what others might say, I would not consider this a "party" game. It does include an area normally found in "party" games but the focus really goes to the challenges you have to beat in order to advance. Very fun game with an amazing theme and artwork.

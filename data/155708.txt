In my book, lower ratings are reserved for games that do not offer any kind of meaningful decisions. Here this is exactly the case. You could argue that all your decisions are very important, i.e., where to move and when and what kind of an action to execute there. However, you are just running around putting out fires, which will get very very repetitive after two rounds. You do not get to analyse different situations, but instead your decision making tree is always the same. BORING.

You'll also notice the horrible art. I cannot recall a game equally disgusting to look at. To be fair, art is not a deal breaker here but it certainly does not anything positive to the experience. 

If there is something positive about the game, at least it is not broken.

A very disappointing game for me. I was expecting Defenders of the Realm in a small box. Instead the game feels incredibly not thematic to the point of feeling the invasion is a form of bookkeeping. I really wanted to like this as I enjoy the other tiny epic games, but this one was a total miss for me.

Hmmm. I've only played this once, so my rating is may not be entirely fair.
Probably need a few more plays to give the "Turn deck" mechanic a fair shake, but it really seemed to remove real, meaningful decisions.
But I tell you what, the threat increases pretty fast. You go from "this is easy" to "Holy crap our kingdom is collapsing all around us" in a matter of minutes!

This is an 'absorption' style co-op game not unlike Samurai Spirit, where you're moving characters around to different regions to take hits for them when monsters from a deck would attack them. Variable player powers and randomly drawn Epic enemies ensure some replay value, and there are artifacts that can help you, plus the enemies and Dire enemies you face each play will be slightly different. The art is on the level with Tiny Epic Kingdoms, and while this one does share that game's mildly 'generic' feel, it can still be a tense and entertaining exercise with lots of decision making, which is to me the benchmark of a successful co-op.

Tiny Epic Defenders is excellent, and will be one of the few microgames that sees regular play in my collection.  The variety of the heroes, dire enemies, and epic foes give the game excellent re-playability, and the game produces a decidedly different experience (and strategy required to win) with 1, 2, 3, or 4 players.  Fun, fast, and feels meatier than the time required to play it would suggest.  Highly recommended.

Like Room 25, this game is not fun solo. But if it's not fun solo then I can't see it being a whole lot more fun with other players. Unlike Room 25, this one does not have a hidden traitor element. In my experience, the best coop games are also fun in solitaire mode. I will give this another chance, but for now, its not my favorite.

For me this felt like a simpler, less interesting version of Ghost Stories.

Was unfortunately underwhelmed and disappointed in the rule book. Man that is a bummer, great game for sure, but sucks to have questions mid game and the rule book is useless.

I was looking forward to this, and quite enjoyed TEK previously. But it is a total stinker. Really, really, really bad. Would be a contender for one of the worst games I've ever played, it's that bad. Boring, repetitive, lacking meaningful decisions, dictated entirely by the order of cards in the deck. one card gets added to the deck each round and you have to go through all the same cards again with this one addition. Mind numbingly dull. I din't care whether I won or lost as long as that brought about the end of the game. I will never play this again. One plus side - the little flame tokens were cool.

Nice, quick castle defense game. Enough variability to keep it interesting.  Lots of Epic Foes, characters, and the different location abilities is a nice touch too.

TED is a quick and simple cooperative card game. It is engaging and fun with some tough decisions to be made on your turn.

Feels too much like fantasy Pandemic but even simpler and more random with the treasure card draw and how effective they are. The tactical decisions are pretty straightforward and therefore less engaging for me. On the plus side it plays quicker and easier to setup because of it's tiny.

Limited cards mean games might feel samey on the attack side. On the other hand there are a lot of heroes and final bosses to choose from.

Since I feel the Pandemic puzzle is generally solved, it doesn't provide interesting gameplay to me and hurts my view of all other variants or similar games that use the mechanism. Fully cooperative games like this also don't provide much of a narrative that I enjoy from other types of cooperative games.

I think there is at least a slight design flaw when there is a way to play a game in order to enjoy it that might not be obvious or called out in the rules.  In the case of this game you need to pay attention to what is in the turn deck and plan ahead versus just reacting to what has happened.

I also think this is probably best a 1-2 player game and it is best to think of the characters as troops.  In a two player game, you should each take two characters.  As a solo game you could adjust the difficulty by using three characters instead of four.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cute, simple, short coop game which nonetheless packs a punch. While the only luck is in the order of the Turn deck, it is still quite challenging to win at this game.
In some ways, it reminds me of the State of Siege games, with the different sides being attacked.
Well worth checking out as an end of night filler or a fast lunchtime game.

There are plenty of characters, epic bad guys and dire bad guys to make this a different experience everytime you play however there is a hell of a lot of cube pushing in this rather than actual combat mechanics. 

When bad guys turn up they either punch your character if you happen to be stood where they hit or they hit a predetermined location. Then they bugger off. You dont really fight them... just sort of mill around until the big bad (epic foe) turns up and then keep taking punches in the face until you, it or the capital city are dead. 
This is not as interesting as it sounds.

I had high hopes for this game, but in the end it felt like it just played itself and came off bland because of the lack of meaningful decisions. Felt very repetitive. My wife and I played the game twice and then we played once with our game group. Our group lost interest halfway through the game. That said, we loved the art and components and my group really likes TEK a lot....We just felt this one was a miss, at least for us.

A nice, relatively thematic cube-pusher that feels a lot like working lower management. There are fires everywhere, you've got a Dixie cup of water, no one is helping, and the boss is on the way.

Except fun, because you can't get fired.

Unless your actual boss catches you playing this when you're supposed to be working, in which case you probably will get fired.

RATING: 4
It's a pretty dull game with a rulebook that doesn't make the gameplay obvious (as a rulebook should I would think).  Also, it's sold as a game that is small enough to put in your pocket ... BUT IT HAS FILLERS!!!!  There's ~1 inch of cardboard space fillers on either side of the long axis.  The only reason I can think of doing this is to keep the box the same dimensions as the cover art, which is a terrible reason.  This just kills me ... why wouldn't you use all of the space in this "tiny epic" box?!?!

Fantastic coop game and works very well solo. Can be very difficult to win, even on the "Easy" difficulty. Deceptively strategic.

Sounds weird, but reminds me of Pandemic, running around controlling threats.  Multiple instances of nothing useful to do on my turn.  Decent game, but I much prefer Pandemic, Flash Point, etc. -- but much better than Tiny Epic Kingdoms.

RATING: 8.5
I can see why people don't fancy this game, but since I didn't back it on Kickstarter (no hype) and I only play solo, I actually find it quite pleasant. It's quick to pull out and play, and doesn't require much thought at all. The rules are simple, the cards are simple, each turn is simple -- sometimes I don't have the mental energy to set up Eldritch Horror, or stress about order cards in Space Hulk Death Angel. Tiny Epic Defenders gives me a nice "light" option. As a bonus, my youngest enjoys a quick game of this with me too.

This one was okay. Not bad, but not near as good as Tiny Epic Kingdoms. It was really random in one of our games and we essentially had no chance at winning. We did have fun playing the game and its portability makes it something we will return to, but as a game it's only middle of the road.

We've only been able to play with 2 players, so opinions may vary with a higher player count. Great art!

Rated as a solitaire game. Not enough meat for more players but works well solo. Enjoyable challenge every now and then. I only wish all the cards were small so it would be more portable. (30.5.2016)

The game is ok. I just don't find the decisions you make that interesting. Again, if it was smaller it would be easier to play on a bus etc. Dropped the rating to 6 from 7. (8.2.2017)

This is very much not my type of game. Cards with text on them just don't capture my imagination. The game flows smoothly, is somewhat quick to explain (although an overview sheet with the actions on it would have been nice) and doesn't take long to play. To me, it was entirely void of atmosphere and felt like bookkeeping. I might just not be a modern gamer - why is this so popular?

While this rating may change later, after several plays, I adore this game. I've only played solo, and while I understand the complaint made by some about the combat itself not feeling very much like combat (i.e. Tom Vasel's Dice Tower review), I don't feel that this game is really a combat game in the first place: to me, it's more like Maquis - a worker placement-esque planning game, where you're focus isn't combat, but the strategic use of your heroes to best accomplish your goals. Like Maquis, this has been all positive for me - though, geeze, it is hard as absolute hell.

Rating based on a couple plays of the PnP. Just not all that exciting. I know everybody said that the PnP is supposed to be impossible even on easy, but I don't get it. There is no tension whatsoever, the game is really easy at least up to medium, and I am certain we were playing correctly.

There are some things to like. Well, one thing maybe. I like the turn/horde deck business. It is cute, and not knowing exactly when your turn will come up is neat. The rest of the game was dry, dry, dry. And it wasn't because of the lack of art. I am able to overlook that.

Definitely not epic. But it is tiny, so an extra 0.5 for honesty.

RATING: 8
Nice little game.  The cards and tokens/meeples are nice. My husband and I had a good time playing the game.  It's challenging enough to be fun.  I love that there are so many defenders that you can chose to be, and most have pretty useful abilities.

After many plays it feels a bit flat as a co-op for me, its just a simple puzzle you are trying to stay on top of and solve and often it plays itself, feels like there is no real choice. Looking forward to seeing what the 2nd edition brings.

* Kickstarted! *

A completely different game than Kingdoms, this time players work together to protect the lands against a series of attacks. If your character is in the land, they can lose a life point to save the land; if they run out of life, they must go back to the city centre to replenish. The problem is that at medium, the game is really hard to keep all the attacks away -- and that comes from experienced gamers who played this game multiple times.

PLUS: easy to learn, quick play, theme
MINUS: difficulty may turn off some players

Meh. The prior game by this designer, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, is one of my favorite games right now. Unfortunately, this sequel seems relatively rushed and lacking.

It's not a bad game, but always makes me shrug at the end. "Oh. Okay, we won/lost. I guess we can do something else now." Not that many interesting decisions, and relatively bland overall.

Kudos to the designer for something so radically different for each of his games, though. I hope he continues to attempt to innovate, and will always pay attention to whatever he's doing next.

One play, and I really enjoyed it. I'm a fan of co-op games, and fantasy themes. The game is short and snappy with some interesting decisions and a lot of variability. It's not very deep, but for the play time there is plenty going on and there are often conversations about how to allocate actions.

I disliked Tiny Epic Kingdoms (the prequel?) quite a bit, so I was quite pleasantly surprised by this game. It manages to capture the essence of a co-op thriller in an simplified RPG-ish ruleset.

Effectively every turn, bad cards will slowly decay the realm, and the heroes run around trying to save it. Kill the big bad boss and its done.

2 criticisms: The use of the word 'Succor' to reduce threat was extremely out of place. And a touch of randomness when fighting the Epic Boss would've made this game perfect.

A frequent complaint about co-op games is that they're little more than whack-a-mole, with the group having to run around dealing with a crisis that is always the same, just surging up in different places. Tiny Epic Defenders is that actual game. Literally there is a ring of locations and you have to run to different ones either to defend against vague threats or "succor" the place back to health. Eventually a big bad comes out and you kill him and save the day. We played on the easiest baby setting and won without too much problem. If you like this kind of game, Tiny Epic Defenders distills it into a small, streamlined package.

Tiny Epic Defenders is a tower defense game that plays quickly and requires very basic decisions. Heroes will constantly absorb the hits until spent, move to the center and get out. The game has nice art and is good for new players in the Tower Defense genre.

KickStarted mostly because I KickStarted Tiny Epic Kingdoms.
I don't have high expectations for TED.  Being a co-op is nice, but I just don't see much to be excited about.  The artwork (which worked well in TEK) leaves me cold, the components seem fairly uninspired.  Hopefully gameplay will change my mind!

A lot of fans of the "Tiny Epic" series seem to be saying that this one is probably the weakest. However, I love it. I love the way the tension ramps up, and how you keep seeing the same monsters. It's kind of personal by the end when you're fighting the mega boss while still drawing the same monsters you've been seeing the whole game. My only minor gripe is how this game seems to encourage quarterbacking with the "ally" cards where the whole group shares actions. My solution to this problem was to have players take turns being the "leader", and when it's your turn, you decide how everyone uses actions for the "ally" card. It seems to work pretty well, and adds a little bit of theme each round as the leader "leads" everyone in their fight against the monsters.

This works alright as a solo game. But even as a solo game, there's not a whole lot of tough decisions to make, so I can't imagine how repetitive this must be with 3 or 4 players.

This is basically Pandemic without the whole aspect of collecting and matching the city cards to find the cure. All that's left is you running around all over the place with no secondary goal.

This game kicks our ass. Under .500 for the win ratio (somewhere around 2 and 5) but we still keep coming back because it gives you that satisfied "I just played a fun board game" feeling in a relatively short time (30ish mins). The short time is important during the week when there are 45 mins until it's time to start dinner, sit down to evening workload and then go to sleep. Value is the word I would use to describe this game.

Like other Scott Almes games, I think this one is for a fairly specific demographic. It felt really dry, and math-y to me. How well can you manage 1+1, is 1+2 better? Look, is there an option for 1+3?? Nope, Just do 1+1 until then.

Not for me, but it is "tiny" after all, for a game of this genre that you can fit in your pocket, I don't know what more can expect.

I've had a great time with this game. Smaller geeks of the family feel the same way. Learning curve is easy, it focuses on active listening and communication, cooperative action and strategy.

It has just enough depth to keep thing interesting, just enough threat to keep things busy, and just enough surprises to keep you guessing.

I love also how difficult it is. I've played the game seven times and won two of them. :)

Decent enough as a solo filler, don't think I would ever consider playing with other people though - there just isn't enough to the game for that. Expansion appears to contain the more powerful cards  from the game (both characters, artefacts and enemies) and adds about 1/4 as much to the game, so if you enjoy it it is worth getting.

Tom Vassal review said it all.

I really wish I listened instead of forking out for this.  The gameplay is simple and relatively boring - not much is going on that you are faced with any really tough decisions.

Can be a good game if you are looking for something to kill some time and don't want to use many brain cells, or if you are looking for a coop that you can play with your partner once or twice.

Otherwise, steer clear if your gaming group actually wants to play a game!

Kickstarter exclusive content is unethical: it pushes you to buy the game, by taking advantage of your fear to miss it. This behaviour makes me lose every interest for such games, and makes me dislike them. That's why I rate them 1 and explain the reasons in the comments.

RATING: 7
Really surprised by this one. This is a Pandemic-style co-op with the complexity of Forbidden Island/Desert and the feel of Defenders of the Realm. The game is fairly abstracted. I find it hilarious that most of the game you're literally moving little fire trackers down at various locations. I'm not sure if this was a design decision or not, but it's an amusing tongue-in-cheek jab at most co-ops out there. While this design doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table, I do feel like this has replaced Defenders of the Realm for me. It's the same idea, but it has removed the dice-rolling and the time commitment (Not to mention the setup).

RATING: 5
Tiny Epic Defenders is desperately OK. Its main problem is that you can easily see though the gears, making for instance several bosses look like "OK, they're going to waste us the same amount of action points per turn in a different flavor" and more generally have everything feel incredibly samey. Also while in theory I like it for game balance reasons, I quite dislike the "divide 3-4 AP between any number of players" card because it does the opposite of solving the alpha gamer problem that all coop designs are facing.

The game is a fine little puzzle, albeit a soulless one. Its standout mechanic (which initially sold me the title) is by far the player turns and bad stuff being shuffled into a single deck, preventing a too large foresight of everyone's next move and adding more thrill to the card draw. I'm looking forward to a better coop game to reimplement it.

I prefer a bit more epic in my co-op than in just the title. Turns arrive randomly, and it generally seems an easy call on what the best direction is, which limits one's engagement. But it works and it's pleasant and it's an appropriate length and the cost point is right and it offers replay with the different board settings, so I'm happy to have it hit the table even if I won't be personally searching it out.

"Solid co-op with a fun theme in a tiny box for a small price. The game itself doesn't seem outstanding, but within the constraints of its tiny nature, I think it's a winner."

What I like:
- Components (including the box) are excellent
- Gameplay is solid--like Pandemic Lite
- Turn order system is quite neat
- Fantasy theme is good
- Tiny box!!! Yay!!! Very portable. 
- Lots of variety with heroes and foes and regions
- Seems to work pretty well solo w/1 hero
- Plays quickly (solo learning game was 30 minutes)

What I don't like:
- Turn order can be VERY brutal and swingy (when all your turns are clumped together)
- The cards that just say "enemy" feel a bit generic

If you go into this expecting a light (but interesting), small co-op, it should meet or exceed your expectations. I would put the weight around 1.8 (comparable to Forbidden Island).

It feels more thematic than Pandemic to me, but it is not as thematic as Flash Point or Forbidden Desert.

We'll see how the second edition turns out, but the first edition is the weakest of the Tiny Epic series. There's just too much unmitigated randomness for my tastes. Since I'm often playing with people who don't consider themselves gamers, I need a coop that won't always beat us down. (It's not bad for solo play, but other games are better.)

PnP version.  A short, lightweight co-op which doesn't outstay its welcome.  There is a reasonable amount of luck involved as to whether you succeed or fail, and the games start to feel somewhat samey after 4 or 5 (though the full game could easily address this with added characters, items, foes and terrain effects).  Still suffers from the usual co-op problem of the "alpha-gamer" calling most of the shots.

It took me four games but I've finally broken myself of buying the Tiny Epic games. The enthusiasm of the creators is infectious but none of the four that I got did anything special.

No one that I've introduced the games to has been excited about any of it - bland art, bland theme, bland components, bland mechanics. Tiny Epic Bland.

22-02-2015. Rated after 1 play (but not a very fresh play). 

TED is a cooperative game, in which some random evil (symbolized with a card), wants to destroy the world you inhabit. For the game, there are a certain number of cards with locations and the player colors shuffled). Each gameround, all cards are flipped one at a time, and locations are attacked. If ever a location becomes maximally damaged, it is destroyed and damage is converted to the central city you are trying to protect. If it's your turn, you have 3 action points (or 4, if you take a damage) to run around and fix the damage.

All in all, the game felt incredibly samey to me. It was boring and while the game was simple and give you a cooperative feel, it was not really engaging, interesting.

2/22/2015 6.85 - It's a nice game.  It is pretty tiny and the theme is actually well applied to the game.  There is no epic feeling about it, though I can see that playing this for 20 mins could be preferable to a 2 hour game of Defenders of the Realm.  The quick playing time is a plus, and there are some decisions to make, occasionally clever combos arise that surprsie you.  But there aren't a lot things to decide on, and ultimately the game comes down to your draw when the epic foe comes out, which is disappointing sometimes.

------------------------------------
This is a great little cooperative game and I've enjoyed my plays of it as something of a 'Mini-Pandemic' (Would be super curious to see what a TED retheme to diseases would be like).

Frustratingly, the 'expansion' is only compatible with a 2nd edition of the game - Not only would that mean re-buying if I want it, but the kickstarter becomes even more grossly overpriced (It would have cost more than Scythe for the game+expansion+shipping, and then had a massive customs slap on top because Gamelyn can't be bothered to arrange EU friendly shipping and getting bother together takes it over customs limits, eurgh).

Might see if I can sell my 1st Edition TED at UKGE and if I see the 2nd Edition + Dark War at a good discount sometime I may pick them up..We'll see.

2 solo plays, Hard level

It's a co-op, therefore ultimately not very interesting to me. I found the game kind of boring and repetitive, too. You flip a card, defend if a hero is there (maybe), or take an action (from a simple list of options -- use the region's special power or your own, or heal the region; maybe fight the Epic Foe), or let the region take a hit -- if enough, it's destroyed and further damage goes to the capital city. Ideally at a minimum you want to learn which regions are being targeted in the first pass through the Turn deck. Then, when you add a new card, you need to memorize that as well. You won't know the order of attacks but at least you'll know which regions will be hit the most often, and therefore which you need to defend (as well as regions with special powers you need, of course). But, like many co-ops, the game is really random: hero turn order, and the sequence of regions being attacked, are both entirely up to the shuffle. You need to get lucky, it seems, and have a good memory. But mostly get lucky.

Components are pretty good, and nicely compact. The rulebook, however, is not so great -- there's even a [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1318570]ridiculous FAQ[/url] here! And the artwork? Pretty ugly!

NOT for me!

Dull co-op where players defend a realm (a set of location cards which their meeples can move between) from the incoming horde. Drawing an enemy card attacks 1-2 locations, which can be defended if players are present or take damage otherwise. Drawing an ally card allows players to move, heal locations, activate their own abilities, the locations' abilities etc.

It's pretty terrible. As a general rule, co-ops work on the basis either of narrative or puzzle. The better the thematic immersion (story, simulation) the more randomness is OK. There's no theme here at all, just random draws and putting out fires until it's over one way or the other. The key strategic element is just remembering where enemies will attack. Also, the artwork is dreadful.

I was really turned off by the random nature of the turn deck the first few times we played.  I played a game with my daughter where everything was looking good until 5 straight enemy cards came up and we lost.

As we get more comfortable with the actions on the locations we are able to combine  those actions with the hero actions we are able to tame the randomness and have won a few games.  Tracking what areas are being attacked is also very important.

I have always been interested in Defenders of the Realm, but it's expensive, has a long play time, and I don't like games that depend on rolling certain things with dice.  I feel like TED offers a good alternative for the price.

Already feel that my fully kitted out Defenders of the Realm is too light on theme to actually warrant a real fantasy feel. But at least it has some variety.

Totally bored by this generic game. There are not even any interesting decisions to make. I can 'move to an area and reduce threat'. Or... or what? That's it? Just decide where to move to? Uhh.. why would I want to play this game again?

If you are into decent fantays, grab a copy of Runebound 2nd ed. Or Defenders of the Realm as it at least gives you more variety in effects turning up. If you are into smaller fantasy games and dig the 'Tiny Epic' denominator, Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Tiny Epic Quest are so much better installments of this line. If you are into cooperative games, just grab a copy of Pandemic (or even Legacy) and you'll feel so much better.

If I play an adventure game, I want to level up, get cool gear, be able to discover hidden locations, discover cool spells to add to my growing arsenal of 'being bad-ass'. Facing and (cooperatively?) taking down that big enemy in the end. And I want to choose when I'm ready to go to his throat. Yes, this can be with a timer or as a race game mechanic to keep the time pressure intact. 

What I don't want is boring actions with generic characters reducing threat levels until the big guy finally deems to make an appearance and allow a game to end. Pass.

I've been looking for a colorful, simple, and fast (as in finish games in under an hour - preferably in under 30 minutes) game to play with my wife and kids.  Our first session went extremely well - enough so that I think Tiny Epic Defenders might be the family co-op game I've been searching for.  (Update:  Great game, but it just didn't have much replayability for us.)

This game is great! The rules however are not so great. Once we worked out what we were doing the game play was a lot smoother and I love the cooperative aspect of it. Now I just need to try it solo :D 
I have now played this game more and more and every time I play it I enjoy it even more than the time before.

Not a bad small coop game. KS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The decisions are all very obvious, there's not much depth, and overall the game is mostly really easy to beat.

So why give it a decent rating? A few reasons. The turn order deck is a fun idea. You don't know when you'll get a turn next or what the turn order will be, so you can only plan so much. Another thing is the variety. You've got a stack of heroes, monsters, dire monsters, and boss monsters. You've also got a number of artifacts, and each location is double-sided so you can mix them up however you want. That makes for a lot of different configurations every time you play. The fast playing time is also a plus. A game seems to take under 30 minutes with any player count (but I haven't played with four yet). The simplicity means that this could be a good game to introduce somebody to the idea of co-op games if they're brand new to modern board games.

Sold.

I preferred the print and play version to the Kickstarter one though. That is, I'm not a fan of the changes which were made.

Good about the game: Easy to set up and good theme.

It's a cute little package, a sort of frentic scramble for position that captures a lot of what's in much larger coop monster rush games, but the randomness of the cards introduces frustrating levels of non-agency for the players. I don't feel any urge to play it again.

A well constructed, if woefully generic, co-op. Had this come out before Pandemic (or even Ghost Stories) it would be hailed as a masterful piece of design. As it is, it remains wildly functional without the benefit of being truly outstanding.

Can't see myself playing this multiplayer and it will probably not be played solo very often either. That being said, it's a fun little game that I'm happy to have in my collection. I like that it travels well, has simple rules, plays fast and has quick setup and teardown.

Quick and light and easily solo'ed tower defense card game.  Action points of variable heroes travel around the circle of kingdom terrain location cards to neutralize the target area's doom level increments from the hoard cards.  Recycling and building the horde deck has a Pandemic aspect as the horde concentrates on certain areas of the kingdom.  Dire monsters come into play with special effects adding a twist to the challenge.

This is actually the KS Deluxe Edition. When Gamelyn Games offered whatever remaining stock they had of their KS Deluxe versions of TED and TEK, I just had to pick them up! Besides, as far as TED goes, the full version truly is superior to the PnP. Since I don't have a printer at home, recreating a prototype (PnP) version is just as costly to recreate as simply purchasing the full version.

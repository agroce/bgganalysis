A sleeper hit from last year's Essen that always sounded fun to me. Saw the chance to get it and pounced. 

It's a fun, quick family game, with rules that are easily explained. 20-minute filler with some definite strategical decisions.

If you are itching for a very quick area influence game, this might be the ticket.  Game play is lightning quick with scoring likely to take you as long as game play.  the variable board layout makes the game have some variety. The turn order reversal between part 1 and part 2 along with the direction of play shift (from lowest to highest number lake for part 1 and from highest to lowest for part 2) also adds a nice twist on the game.  It is possible to create some board layouts that are not as entertaining gamewise, but these are (hopefully) limited.  Most appear to have lots of critical points where timing of placement is key to a good win.  Good filler type game that can play 2-4 comfortably.

Titicaca on speed.  Gets a very high rating due to its speed of play (~15 minutes).  You don't want to play this with someone who tries to analyse all possible actions 10 moves in advance though.  As a fast filler,  excellent.  Fortunately we had an experienced player handling the player order - I would have struggled a bit with this.

Such easy rules to learn I managed to pre-read and then teach 4 others the game in less than 5 minutes. Game then does what it says on the tin, plays out in 45 mins (both 1-15 and 15-1) and has significant depth. Subsequent games have played out in around 20 mins.

Every time I play this I remember how much I like it and wonder why I don't play it more.  Very quick with great components.  it's a puzzle to try to build long caravans while starting everyone else from doing the same.  It's simple to teach and quick to play.  Great game.

I usually do not like abstract perfect information games, but I enjoyed this one.  It has simple rules, plays quickly, and yet has some depth to it in deciding when to pass instead of placing.  It's nothing spectacular, but I like it as a quick filler that isn't completely brainless.

RATING: 6
I had fun with this incredibly simple meatier-feeling filler, but I can't really figure out where the fun game from.  The game scoring is somewhat similar to Kardinal & Konig (China) in that you're going for area majorities as well as groupings of your pieces.  However, the game really constrains where you're allowed to place at any given time, and the system used makes turn order crucial during certain placements.

However, this can sort of be planned for, as the placement constraints go in a strict pattern, so you know exactly at what time you'll need to be first in turn order to get that crucial placement.

I really can't imagine wanting to play with 6, however, as the control with 4-5 players is already borderline.  Three or four players seems like the sweet spot here.

Overall, I guess the fun comes from the angst over whether or not you get that crucial placement or not and I really enjoy this is a somewhat meatier but simple filler.

RATING: 6
Played at Spiel 2007, got a copy there, and played it about two dozen times since then at various player numbers. In conclusion: I like this game. Initially just a simplied version of area encirclement games like Through the Desert or go, the real fun comes in when people decide to pass and be the first in line to place cabin wagons for the next lake. The only snag is that the decision to pass is nearly always quite obvious, especially in the case of very long chains of wagons. With more players, these chains decrease in value to the point where they are competitive point-wise with the value of the lakes you're trying to surround&mdash;but by that time the lack of control makes itself felt.

Nevertheless, provided you don't try to coax too much meaning out of it, this game is fast, furious, and goes over very well. In terms of depth and satisfaction for a 'normal' game, you'd be well advised to look at the two titles I already mentioned, but when it's late, you don't have much time anymore, spirits are high, and people are asking for 'one more for the road'...? Gipsy King is your man. (Or game.) The first game from Cwali which didn't feel somewhat 'off' for some reason, and one I'm glad to own.

RATING: 5
Components: Simple, functional components. The muted colors on the tile make the terrain seem swamp-like and depressing.

Experience: Interesting twist on the area control game, where only pockets of area are available at a given time, and much like a sports draft, I can give up my pick now in favor of first pick from a better pool later. Lots of opportunities for cutting people off, to prevent large connections. Every point counts, so the game can slow down as a player tries to calculate the cost benefit of each possible spot. I keep making the mistake of thinking this is about surrounding the fish; note to self: this is a connection game!

I just love the theme, nice that some designers aren't afraid of not being PK.

What can I say about the game? Passing at the right moment is vital, force your opponent to stop each other when the really don't want to and grab all the nice fishes yourself.

Update: Way too chaotic with 5 players, not recomended.

Placement game where you are claiming hexes around lakes, trying to get majority scoring and form chains for points.   Nothing spectacular, but quick and easy.   I don't think there is much room for strategy as the whim of the other players dictates the game more than anything else.   Also, one person has the tedious job of tracking the turn order.

Very enjoyable abstract that has simple rules, depth, and plays in about 30-45 minutes.  Most points are scored by large grouping of caravans but the fish pond bonuses seem crucial since scores are likely to be very close.  One minor gripe is the sucky scoring track.

The theme is irrelevant, but the game works well and I could have made better decisions, which means I'm happy to try it again. We forgot to make double moves in the second half, which could have made a big difference. The graphics are a little dark. I'll give this a few more goes, we shall see... ** Played it some more and like it. It's light but neat. It depends on the other players but the brinkship and timing is very good. If one player must be blocked, but you duck out, then the pressure is the other players to waste their piece blocking, leaving you in good place for the next move. The double caravans are good when you recall them.

Gipsy King is a multiplayer abstract, mechanically obviously related to Titicaca by the same designer. 3 players is likely the sensible maximum as it gets quite chaotic with more. Gameplay isn't spectacular by any means, rather as is often the case with Cwali's games, it's a an extension of a pretty simple core mechanism and although it works quite nicely as a quick filler game the design feels just a little rough around the edges (the lake scoring in particular).

Gipsy King is a simple area-control game with an elegant queue-management aspect. On a turn, a player who's at the front of a queue can place one piece (or two depending on the phase) anywhere on the board. However, if they chose they can pass and move their piece towards the front of the queue for the next turn. These simple rules make for a very cool game. It's my second-most preferred lunch-time game at the moment.

This one is making it to the table more often.  Not everyone in the family has figured out the defensive moves yet and some players have had huge winning scores.  I think this game will get better over more plays and better developed strategies amongst us all.

RATING: 8
May 2009 -- We've played this game three times, and have enjoyed it. I think we will continue to bring it out several times a year. It has interesting placement rules, and the turn order changes frequently, which takes a little getting used to. I created a player aid, to help keep track of the turn order changes, and we found it helpful. The obvious strategy, it seems to me, is simply to create the largest groups of caravans possible, as the fish scoring doesn't make a lot of difference. The challenge is deciding when to pass and when to play.

October 2011 -- I rarely do well in this game, but I always have fun playing it.

2013-November:  I still don't score well, but I always enjoy playing it.

RATING: 7
An extraordinarily simple idea, but it produces some interesting albeit light choices.  Players take turns placing a caravan marker, or choosing to skip their turn in order to move earlier in a future round (which allow placement in a more important location).  The pleasingly chunky pieces, the randomized board, and the relaxed feel make Gipsy King a very nice filler.  I've played mostly at the higher end of the player scale, and while the game does scale well, I suspect that "the fewer the better" will be the general rule for Gipsy King.

Played it once in Essen with 3 friends. We were all very disappointed. It was so simple that we all got bored very soon.

Gipsy King might be fun with children, though.

Lots of fun for an abstract.  I usually don't care for abstracts but the passing and timing mechanism makes for an interesting game with some good decisions.

A filler.  Nice one, but only a filler..
Rules and the whole idea is extremely simple, but it *might*'ve been a competitive game if the board was larger (or sth).  As of now other player's moves and/or the specific flow of the gameplay impact your possibilities/score too much.  And you cannot do anything about it.

My reservations concern 4-player mode.  Maybe the problem I described is less troubling with smaller number of players..

I regularly play the two-player-version at www.mastermove.eu. Nothing outstanding, but a nice abstract diversion. The boardgame is a slightly adjusted multiplayer implementation. As with Powerboats which also started as a two-player online game on this site, the porting to real-life multiplayer causes some frictions and especially the lake scoring part is improvised. Still, a fine 30 minutes multiplayer abstract although I doubt that it's worth playing with five players, possibly four is too much as well.

Another solid game from Cwali which is very straight forward to play and plays quickly.  Basically, one seeks to build caravans and gather around lakes with fish!  Pretty simple, right?  Except for the fact that everyone else is also trying to do the same and/or block you from expanding your caravan.  On your turn, you choose to either pass or play a caravan.  If you pass, you get to go to the front of the line (or behind whoever previously passed) which you will want to do at times in order to expand your caravan in future turns.

Also, a game that is all about passing quickly loses interest for me, though the game is short. Our second game was five-player with lots of pointless lakes, and that didn´t make the game better imo. Components are uninspiring. All in all, not a game I would ask to play again but I wouldn´t refuse it.

RATING: 7.75
I played the prototype 4 times. It has a simple but very smart system. Constantly you have to decide whether to play or to pass instead and have a good position for the next number. You need to optimize two ways of scoring: for majorities in surrounding the lakes of scoring with your group. Good decisions, middle weight, it plays in half an hour. This game has the addiction factor! Actually the boardgame version (as opposed to the online version) is 2-5 players.

Simple rules. It may be presented as a family game by the designer, but I think that is way too modest. This is a luckfree tactical placement game, there is enough in there for gamers as well. Not to be underestimated, it plays quickly. Beware, this is addictive!

Abstract game where players score points for majorities around enclosed lakes.  Some tough decisions but since there is a relatively small, finite number of choices, as compared to some abstracts, it didn't feel like a brain-burner.  I wasn't in love but because of the short playing-time and the interesting player interaction I would certainly play it again.

A relatively short and simple game whose complexity belies its simpleness.  The map is made out of a number of randomly placed lakes surrounded by land, and on their turn players either place one of their caravans next to the current lake or pass.  If players pass, they get to be the first person to put a caravan around the next lake.  That's it.  Players get points for having long caravans, as well as having the most caravans around lakes with fish.

The game is elegantly simple, yet requires a decent amount of thought as players must plan out carefully when to pass and when to place.

The game is certainly not nearly as deep as Puerto Rico, Agricola, or Le Havre, but it seems like it will be a great filler for when we want something short but not brainless.

I tend to like themed-abstracts and this is no exception. It's a simple game (create the board, then place wooden pieces trying to form connected sets while placing near the lakes with the most fish) but there's some interesting decisions to make.

RATING: 6.5
Gipsy King is a simple area majority game. The board is modular, and shows a pastoral landscape dotted with numbered lakes. The map divided into approximately 30 campsites. Players take turns placing gypsy caravans onto the campsites around lake #1. If a player passes, they will go first when placing caravans at lake #2 (and so on). When the board is full, players score for majorities around lakes that contain fish, and for having clusters of caravans in adjacent areas. The game is very simple (extremely easy to teach) and plays fairly quickly. The real interest comes in deciding whether or not to pass and be in good position for the next lake.
Components are average. The board pieces are OK (similar weight to the Power Boats board) but the caravans are painted green, brown, red, blue and yellow. This pretty-much guarantees that players with any form of colour-blindness will have problems.

Played once (5p) with my regular group. Generally went over quite well, but it's not perfect. Mostly what I don't like is that there are often 'obvious' plays - particularly in the second half of a round when you can already see who stands to gain the most from placing on a particular hex. So you can be left with an unpalatable choice: Fall on your sword and place to block (which puts you to the back of the line and reduces your chances of getting a primo spot later) or pass and hope that someone else will do the honours. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine enough design, but it's not going to get nearly the replay that Factory Fun did - I think I'm well into the double digits in plays for that one.

RATING: 7
An abstract placement game that hit a lot of right buttons. A turn is easy ... place right here, or pass. I like limited decision trees in this type of game, keeping it pacey. The decision to pass is made when there's an even move valuable spot at an upcoming lake and you want first dibs at it. The game then becomes one of judging how far ahead will anyone else pass to deny you that spot, and making sure you pass ahead of them. While making sure that you aren't handing too much value to the other players who will continue to take turns until your preferred spot comes up. Which makes for a surprisingly funny game (with friends) of you do it, no you do it, damn you, you do it, I'm not going to do it, you do it - arrrggghhh! This game sparks a lot of references to Batiatus' Jupiter and taking one for the team.

Gipsy King is a game about chain-building and turn order.  Regions on the map are called in a predetermined order, and those with a better turn order can either place in that region, or pass and get a better turn order for future regions.  It sounds pretty basic, but there was actually a lot of tension and getting in each other's way here.  I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.

Played 2 quick games at Essen 2007 and enjoyed it much more than I expected!  Once 3-player, once 2-player, and both seemed good.  It's like an elegant quick version of Titicaca, in that you place units in areas according to numbered sequence and try to get control of the areas, and also have large connected groups.  I am really starting to actively enjoy and seek out games of pure strategy with random starting positions, and this is a fine example of such a game.

A nice light abstract game with a wonderful turn-order mechanism–you can pass your turn in the current round to play earlier in the next. Deciding on when to play caravans or when to pass is the crucial decision on almost every turn and it really makes this game enjoyable for me. The modular board adds variety and replayability to the game

Gipsy King -- Played twice; three- and four-player.  A tactical abstract, it plays quickly and offers enough depth to be satisfying.  The board is variable, but the locations for placement are numbered, and must be filled in order.  This offers players some strategic control, because passing one's turn allows earlier placement at the next locale.  Playing the first round builds familiarity with the board and its opportunities, but in the second round locations are placed in the reverse numerical order, keeping round two interesting.

Stayed in my memory for its murky, hard to read graphics and a lot of stuff one needs to internalise to play well (numbers on board and fishes). Apart from it, it's a quick spatial game. Kinda abstract meets bidding. A lots of interesting positioning going on with having to evaluate which spots are important to you. (kinda Knizia like). It's not that elegant however.

A quick, easy-to-explain abstract game of area-influence. Nothing random after initial setup.The map is built randomly and has lakes or land. Initial random turn order; then, whenever you pass on your turn you advance to the next available spot in turn order for NEXT turn (first to drop out is first in order next turn). On your turn, you place one of your caravan markers on any land space adjacent to lake n (1->15). In the 2nd (final) round of game, repeat above but in reverse order (lakes 15->1). Also, you may place a pair of markers on one space, twice.At the end of each round, score: 1. For each lake, rank the player's by #markers around the lake. Also rank the water tiles showing fishes. Players get VP of the water tile matching their rank (all tied players get equal VP).2. Get VP for all of your markers based on number of contiguous markers, in triangle progression: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, etc.

Abstract game by Corne. His games work pretty fine, all of them. Not many rules, solid designs and fun to play.
Gipsy King was released in Essen 2007 with lots of secrecy. The secret was kept until 2009 and I'm glad I've deiscovered it now. It's not a Uau!! kind of game but it still works pretty fine with gamers. Not suitable for newbies I'm sure.

RATING: 3
[Cwali 2007 edition] {Abstract; modular board, connection, variable-player-order; optimal 2p} Gipsy King is a very dull game. It's an abstract game (no theme) with variable setup. The rule is short and simply but ambiguous. Decision is meaningful only with good group dynamic; otherwise, your action is forced when one or more players passed carelessly. The first mover of each round has good advantage. There exists a king-making problem, too. I will only consider playing again with 2 players, not for more.

Not good. No desire to play again. I may play it with 2 players, thought. There are many other better games in this genre. If you like connection game, play "Through the desert" instead.

This game isn't that bad, I just don't want to play it that much.

The game's most central feature is that it frequently involves multi-player prisoner's dilemma.  You can pass now so that you can go first around the next pond and hope that later players "do the right thing" and fill in the spaces.  Or you can fill in a space and "take one for the team" and screw yourself on the next turn.  I don't find this to be all that enjoyable.

Played 2-, 3- and 5-player so far. Very tactical game with a clever play order mechanism. Beautiful bits, simple game play, great way to spend 10-30 minutes. The more players there are, the tougher it is to score points and the fish in the lakes become more valuable.

Addictive abstract that deserves more praise than it gets.  It has simple rules, quick gameplay, and scales well from three to five (I don't think it's so hot with two).  Given its simple rules, there are a surprising number of tough choices in the game, many of which center around the turn order mechanism, which really shines with four and five, when the decisions are more juicy.  The artwork on the landscape tiles is beautiful, and the variable board setup should help keep things fresh.

RATING: 6
This is a deceptive game. On the surface of things, it's a trivial area control game to see who gets the most valuable lakes, but just under the surface there's a game of subtle timing of forcing your opponents into bad turn order positions while trying not to let them create too large a scoring group.

Plays very fast, very quick to explain, deep enough to need a couple of plays to get the hang of. My score will go up if this is also interesting to play with more players.

A simple game, but not so overly simple that the decisions are all automatic.  There are some interesting choices in blocking and  decidng when to pass, but not so difficult that the game bogs down with excess decision time.  

Passing here has a notable distinction compared to other games since it reorganizes the playing order.

The game maintains your attention and plays with a comfortable quickness.

RATING: 4
This one just doesn't do it for me.  I've played it with two and with four and there just isn't enough to do to make it interesting.  Tiles are placed at random forming ponds and land.  Ponds are numbered 1-15 and you take turns placing buggies on the tiles surrounding each lake in order.  When it's your turn you can pass forcing others to finish the current lake and letting you choose first on the next one.  You get points for having the majority around a lake and if there is more than one adjoining lake you get points for second and so on.  Points are awarded based on how many fish are in the biggest lake tile for first, second biggest second and so on.  You also get points for having wagons connected to one another.  It's unique but not enough there to keep my interest.  Good news is that it's fairly short.

This feels like a nice, reductionist iteration of Hacienda (which I know, isn't very complex itself, nevertheles...) what I like about Gipsy King is its brevity and simplicity. Anything that plays 5p is going to be attractive to my main groups, and I'm hoping this is a nice, short majorities game that can easily be reset and played again immediately after.

The components are a touch wonky but you know, I've learnt to accept that as part of the charm. It wasn't an expensive game and the modular board means a different setup each time.

It's a terribly simple game that turns out to be quite interesting. the basic rules give rise to a fast game with interesting choices, some tricks.
Not sure about replayability, probably it is quite scarce as the only thing that seems to vary is landscape.

fun and simple filler. mechanics are interesting and i am not sure if they are, but they seem somehow original and this is a good aspect of gipsy king.

[EDIT] after a long time i played it again and i had to raise the rating to 8. it is such a fun game, fast, simple and with very interesting decisions. i friend bought it for just 3 euros at Essen... i have to go back to Essen as soon as possible for the same bargain !!!

Three things keep Gipsy King interesting: (1) the option to pass to set up for a future placement, (2) the modular board, which ensures that no two games play out the same way, and (3) the mechanical differences between the two halves of the game (placing two blocks at once, resolving the tiles in reverse order).

Light, short, pretty fun, and better than expected.

RATING: 8
Quick game. Place RV around lakes. Area majority scores the lakes with fish in them. The big score is to form long connected chains of RV. Playing defensively to stop others must be done carefully. Passing to place earlier for the next lake seems to be a better long term strategy. (Wisdom after 4 plays.)

Played once face-to-face (with 3 players) and once online (with 2 players). A nice filler, which in my opinion works best with only 2 (mainly to prevent kingmaking issues).

A re-implementation of Imperial.  I liked this one a little better than the original, primarily because the wrap-around board prevents countries from being too isolated (GB and Russia) and makes attacking more versatile.  Also, tankeeples are awesome.

RATING: 8
in the core a great economic simulation, packaged as a geopolitical conflict
theme and mechanisms fit together very well and the graphic design of the material is well done
Unfortunately, a player may arrive relatively early in a situation where he can hardly win the game

I especially like the satirical aspect of the game
if you are aware of what actually happens in the game, then often very funny but also shocking situations arise

A little long and a little dry.  Game seems too artificially balanced.  With that said, there is a lot of player interaction and emergent gameplay.  Would play again, but not sure how much fun it is.

This game delivers what you'd expect - and does so very well. It has all the look and conflict of the classic Risk game, but with a completely different and devilish system beneath based on financing. It feels classic and old school, yet it plays superbly. It lacks some tension in my estimate, but repeated plays may remedy that as I get a feel for the flow. I like it quite well over all.

I bought this after playing it at a friend's house while my wife and kids were out of town. I really enjoyed it and figured it would be a good game to own. Maybe it's just my demographics right now, but I have only convinced people to play this two times since I bought it a year ago. That has been disappointing. I think I would still like to play it again....

RATING: 9
+ good match of theme and mechanics
+ elegant and ingenious scoring systems
+ simple rules, easy to learn, hard to master
+ very deep experience in a short playing time (a little over 2 hours once you know what you are doing)
+ huge replay value
+ it scales well
+ unique, very original game

- I think the original [thing=24181][/thing] is slightly better because it's more tight, more tense and plays a bit faster. Also the actual historical setting helps with the theme. That being said, I also own [thing=54138][/thing], and I like it very much. Even though it's almost the same game with a different map, it actually feels different while you play it. So, it's good for variation.

As good as the original, not sure which one I prefer.

I like the streamlining of the rules around bonuses and paying to go around the rondel but there feels like there are too many neutral areas so countries are often persuaded not to invade each other for the tax benefit of taking neutrals. Would like to play more though as only played once.

RATING: 7
This game has simple rules but is hard to play. It takes some time to recognize that you dont want a country to do well but just so well that you can take some profit out of it. This game took us (4-player game) for about 4 hours and it got a bit boring at the end. You reach a point in the game when everyone has at least some investments in every country and war isnt always the best solution. For about 10 rounds before the end we constantly chose investion and taxes. Maybe the experience will improve after several games. I am defenitly willing to give this game more chances because it has a unique go at a boardgame with this thematic.

RATING: 7
A good game that has a lot of player interaction and one does feel like a immoral businessman trying to profit off the suffering of war or just the shares in a country in general. Deeper negotiations can be or not be part of the game too depending on the group. Which gives the game flexibility. Downside can be analysis paralysis due to the holding of many shares or control of many countries. These too can lead to (depending on players) a lot of downtime between turns.

Same feel as Imperial, with a new map and some improvements on the rules, especially the penalty to move more than 3 spaces which goes up with the power factor (=1+power factor) and the Swiss Bank which will come into its own with higher numbers of players.

As soon as I set down to play Imperial 2030, I realized this was going to become one of my favorite games of all time. I was completely amazed by how simple the mechanics are, while the game is still so tight, so intense and so challenging. 

You can teach the rules in details in about 15 minutes, but the game is still tremendously deep and very difficult to master. It happened more than once that, after finishing playing Imperial 2030, I stood up from the table with a headache... but also with a deeply satisfying and memorable experience. Furthermore, even if this is a Eurogame through and through, there's really a strong thematic element as well. Every single time I played Imperial I spent half the game making jokes, role-playing and being really engaged with the whole experience. It´s so rare to find a game that is so thematic AND so mechanically strong at the same time. Mac Gerdts really gave a lesson of game design here!

I do have however a couple of minor problems with Imperial 2030. The first is its length, which makes it hard to bring it to the table, and the second is actually the same depth that makes me like this game so much. The fact is: I'm not always in the mood to play a game so involved and so mentally challenging. That's why I don't play Imperial more often, even if I really really like it. Yet every time this game hits the table I have a blast and every time I'm amazed once again by its elegance. Imperial 2030 is the very definition of "easy to learn, hard to master"!

Imperial is brilliant game design. I love the hybrid wargame/economic game. Okay, some people argue it's not a wargame at all. But it certainly has some gameplay elements of a wargame, even if investing is the real backbone of the game.

I used to have some issues with the balance of Imperial 2030's map. And to be honest, I still do (watch out for Brazil!). But after playing the original Imperial, I've found myself liking 2030 even more than I originally did. I like the greater focus on neutral territories in 2030 quite a bit.

I particularly like the small rule adjustments they made for 2030 (taxes, Swiss bank, the 30 million bonds). The modern setting fits the pessimistic theme that wars are driven by investors rather than the best interest of nations. But the combat doesn't really fit the 2030 theme at all since it's extremely basic and not very futuristic! Oh well. Fun game.

The first play was a 6-player game where I was the only "gamer". Most of the players approach the game as a war game, which it is not (it is an investment game), and as such the game lasted fffooorrreeevvveeerrr!!!

In spite of all that, I was able to see the potential and looking forward to a second game.

Played 4 handed and enjoyed this a lot. Ian had a poor start and I worry that it's not easy to recover but I'd certainly want to play again. There is a certain perverse pleasure in launching your forces in pointless suicidal attacks just to improve your taxation income next turn!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Imperial 2030 is fundamentally a very similar game to its parent.  It makes several small changes.  The best of these is the increased expense of leaping from tax to invest that precludes Imperial's anti-climactic endgame.  I am less keen on the change to the government's taxation bonus.  The bonus is made more certain by removing the requirement for overall tax revenue to have increased for it to be paid.  This strengthens taxation and weakens the small investor strategy.

I rather like 2030's wrap around board, but like its larger number of neutral areas less.  Imperial's tighter board led to fiercer competition and faster fluctuations of fortune.  Call it nostalgia for Diplomacy, but I also prefer Imperial's pre-Great War setting.

I own the 2030 upgrade kit, so can only speak to the quality of the board and bonds.  Both are good.  The English rules are well written and seem comprehensive.

Reasonable geostrategic game, but will there be in 2030 no airplanes and spacetechnology?

What are you exactly playing? It's a mystery to me. One turn you develop a strategy for one country, then another player 'buys' it over and do what he likes. And this continues all the time. That makes this game flipfloppy.

The game takes too long for what it is.

A perfect blend of mechanics with no dice or cards, stock investements, and wargaming. It has a "New World Order" theme (look it up on Wikipedia). Might seem heavy upon reading the rules but is in reality very easy.

Az első 2030-as partinkban ugyanaz a taktika nyert, mint az első sima Imperial partinkban is: ország nélkül vásárolgatni a részvényeket úgy, hogy közben sehol se legyünk főrészvényesek. Azért elég kiábrándító, ha ez a stratégia verhetetlen. Látok esélyt az ellensúlyozásra (országok pénzét elkölteni), de akkor is túl erősnek érzem ezt.

Egyébként azonos pontot kap tőlem, mint az Imperial. Jobb talán, de végül is majdnem ugyanaz:)

2030 is sort of like a Power Grid expansion.  It hardly changes the game, but at least you have a different map.  I do prefer 2030's use of neutral territories.  The orginal map is a little too tight for my taste.

RATING: 7
I'm intrigued by the thinking processes that are needed when approaching Imperial. Recognising when opponents are likely to turn on your nations so you can switch to investing in their invading nation (which will likely tax well and provide a nice profit) ... Figuring out how to lure players into investing in your patsy nation just before you wreck it by using its forces to thin out other nations... The diplomacy table talk needed to create and sustain temporary alliances and the meta play that can result... It's mechanically simple but provides a deeply complex decision making space. But despite this it is a long game and you can pass long turns waiting for stuff to do. I'm still not sure how I feel about it but it does fascinate me.

Sounds interesting... I'd like to have more these kinds of games about global powers fighting eachothers on the map. Currently only that kind of game I own is War on Terror and it doesn't really shine on that basis even though it is a good game. And even though Risk is also somewhat fitting in that category, that is definitely not what I'm looking for. In Imperial 2030 also the mechanisms sound good.

This was a gift from my 2011 international BGG Secret Santa.

I feel that this is an improvement over [THING=24181][/THING]. The Swiss Bank rules make it easier to play without a flag and the map is somewhat more interesting.

Scratch that. The modified rules for taxation swing the balance heavily towards owning flags making the pure Swiss Bank investor strategy virtually impossible.

RATING: 9
World domination and those who pull the strings behind the scenes is what this game is all about. Though this game is only passingly similar to the classic [thing=181]Risk[/thing], for me it is a game that scratches that classic world domination itch, but does it in a new way as a game for sophisticated gamers who like euro-style game mechanisms. That's a big reason why I love this game. It's got the world map, it's got armies (and fleets!), and its got the epic ebb and flow of world domination and counter-domination. Only unlike Risk, you are not at the whims of lady luck and the fickle favor of her diabolical dice.

In Imperial 2030 you control the outcomes of global conflict and work them out with your fellow investors. That's right, in this game you are not a general or dictator. Instead you are a negotiating bean-counting, investor, albeit a rich and powerful one, who can determine the fate of empires! Negotiation is not an actual mechanic, but subtly you influence your opponents by choosing your actions on Mac Gerdts's tried and tested Rondel mechanism and game system, of which I am a fan. I'm also now a fan of Mac's six-country view of the dominant world powers in 2030. Along with the US, Europe, and Russia, Mac has promoted China, India, and Brazil to the status of serious World powers. What fun it is to watch these three spread their wings and fulfill national destiny or get smashed under the old boot of traditional hegemonies!

Throughout the game you are either investing in countries or directing their global actions. By being the lead investor in a country, you are the one who gets to direct the unleashing of a country's forces across the board. You can use this position to boost a country's power value or you can use a country like a "club" to beat back those who might encroach on your interests elsewhere. And depending how a game plays out, you might even find yourself bottom-fishing your way to a win by picking up cheap investments as a neutral Swiss Banker the entire way and never even getting your hands dirty with the rotten business and collateral damage of world conflict!

In the end, the player who has invested wisely in the right countries will be the ultimate master of the universe by having profited the most in the machinations of world politics and investment. It's this deliciously cynical point of view that makes this game and its predecessor, [thing=24181]Imperial[/thing], feel special. After all, it's not the generals or the presidents who really win, it's those shadowy guys sitting around the smoky table laughing evilly and counting their money. In Imperial 2030, that can be you!

RATING: 5
Really just an expansion to Imperial.  Unfortunate that it's being billed otherwise.

Initial impressions:

Played with 3 new players, who really didn't get the game very well for the first half of the game.  I let my flags be taken away (for victory purposes), and they spent quite a while treating it like a war game, despite my warnings.

When they finally understood, went much more smoothly.

Seems like the nature of the map could exacerbate this type of confusion.

I actually liked the bonus payout system here more - a better reason to have a flag in a country about to tax really well!  Unconvinced about the new rondel >3 rule, and China just felt...weird.  Probably are supposed to go to Australia more, but with only one ship...

Should get many plays out of this one in the coming weeks.  Will see how I feel about a couple of the rules changes then, particularly after the "usual" group gets ahold of it.

Oh, and the box art is the ugliest since Caylus 2nd Ed.

June 2012:

I have reduced my rating from an initial 8.5 to a 5.0.  I have had no desire to play this one for the past 2.5 years - anytime I do, I just play regular Imperial instead.  As far as I'm concerned, this game has no real reason to exist, as it is inferior to Imperial.

It still features some excellent gameplay, however, so I am keeping my rating rather high at 5.0

The mechanics in this game improve Imperial.  The components in this game and the rules can be used with the original game.  If you are looking to buy one or the other I suggest buying Imperial 2030 and not Imperial.  It is not worth owning both copies.  Excellent game that requires intuition as players jostle for supremacy in the beginning game.  Then the mid game requires shrewd strategy to setup your end game for the win.

A lovely, cynical game with surprisingly little spite although there's plenty of negative interaction (at least that's what I saw in the only game I played so far). I guess it's because players don't directly control the nations.

Pretty simple rules. Can drag on a little with slow players, even though it leans much more towards tactical decisions and opportunism rather than strategy per se.

RATING: 9
This game works really well in showing the way in which a group of "investors" are battling it out to make the most money while 6 economic blocks - USA, Europe, Brazil, Russia, India and China (Bric) fight it out on the map. The investor with the biggest stake in a country gets to play the country. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you understand that you win by owning stakes in the countries with the highest price. Controlling the largest economic block is not the objective (but helps).

An interesting idea that fell flat for me.  Basically a more complicated version of risk, where you can switch armies throughout the game.  The combat system is lame, game takes too long, but backstabing and choices that can be made on each turn are the only thing that makes this game playable.

The oceans being much more important was interesting to see, though.

RATING: 8
Even though there is a lot of maneuvering armies and navies in this game, I really like ownership dynamics.  And of course the rondel works supremely in this game (even better in 2030 over the original Imperial).  I've seen the best wargame strategists beaten not because of board position but because of better investment play... but players that are shrewd investors but cannot manage a country are going to fail as well.  There is just too much depth in this game to rank it an 8 along with lighter fare, so I'm giving it a 9.

RATING: 6
This is very much a "after one game" rating. Like many heavier games, it needs a bit of time to get beyond the "I played all the rules right" stage. The mechanisms are nice and there's no getting bogged down in, e.g., combat resolution.

RATING: 7.5
Imperial, set in the future on a bigger map (of the world), with several relatively minor rules tweaks. After just a single play, I find myself in general agreement with those that did not find a great improvement over the original - in fact rather the opposite.

The tax calculations appear to have been smoothed out until you start to think hard about the "8" and "10" columns, and the larger map means more time spent in the initial expansion phase ("phony war" phase). That plus the odd "Swiss bank" rule which also draws out the game and changes the tactics of the rondel, and the extra bonds, means a game which is longer yet one which seems to be decided well before it officially ends.

The play felt padded out or stretched out from the flow of the original to no particular purpose. I think it was the designer's desire to give us more of what we loved about the original. The verdict so far is that I would agree to play again but, if offered a choice, I would much rather stick to the original.

Upgrade kit (so I have to use the wood bits from Imperial, bit of a shame ...)

Better than Imperial for me (but still much rather play without the investor card) - wrapping map and improvements to the power payout and limits on the rondel and game tax-invest rush (payment from country rather than player) tip it.

Somewhat of a learning curve to over come with the strategy, and without knowing what to do, the game can drag. Feels very "risk like" at times. Rating may go up with future plays. SO far only played with 2 and 3

RATING: 7.5
Remake de un juego anterior denominado Imperial, sobre el cual, se han introducido algunas modificaciones. 

Es un juego económico, aunque tiene la apariencia de un wargame. Cada jugador compra deuda de diferentes potencias. Si es el que más deuda posee de una nación, adquiere su control y puede jugar con sus unidades. Aunque hay batallas y conquistas, no se trata de ganar con un país, sino de utilizar los paises adecuados en el momento adecuado para obtener más beneficios.

Muy recomendable. Sobre todo, si uno está acostumbrado a los wargames.. para vivir una experiencia diferente (ojo a tener apego a las potencias, no va de eso.. :)

Overall it's not too different from the original game. I preferred the new rules about steadier the government bonus, the more expensive action skipping and the veto right for the Swiss banks.

Easily one of the top games on my list if not THE one so far. 

Excess planning (via investments, bonds-intetest rates), area control, throw a little bit of battle inside with the simplest troops and attack rules (or maybe you go enter foreign territory in peace and all is well for now), the always satisfying rondel and you have a winner here.

One of the very few board games in which you do not own a specific character/area/ army/something of interest only to you. On the contrary, you are interested in every power, taking control of witchever one suites your plans for victory at the time. 
Loose the ''leadership''? That's OK, you can (and eventually will) gain control of another world power, possibly destroying it's economyonly to leave your oponents with dead-end investments providing no income and move on to buy bonds of enemy interests. They rise in wealth, so do you. 

There is so much going on in this game with zero luck involved. Very very deep.

The gameplay was a bit unintuitive at first. Not only you do not 'own' countries, but sometimes bankrupting them is in your best interest. There are two distinct phases - you spend the first half of the game preparing yourself for the second half, in which most points are scored. Very interesting game (my first rondel experience) that did not resemble anything I had tried before.

I feel like I'm getting better at this, but I still have a hard time expanding when I want to. I think it's more timing than anything else - you have to zig when others zag. I do feel India (and to a lesser extent China) have the advantage in the game due to all the open territory in the South Pacific (and India's proximity to southern Africa).

Really preferred the original to this one. The original seemed to have much more swapping of control of nations between players due to starting with a lower share value. Starting with a 9 million share value instead of a 4 million means you get stuck with your starting nation as it is very difficult to take control from another player. 1 Play.

Very similar to Imperial but with a few minor variants such as the Suez and Panama canals, costlier movement on the rondel and the Swiss Bank to let dispossessed players back into the game.

Imperial 2030 is a stock investment game where you invest in countries in the hope that each country pays out the most money at the end of the game. If you're the top investor of a country, you get to make its decisions and move its armies and navy units on the board.

This is fascinating stuff. I really like investment games, but I've not made the jump to 18XX games. I'm not sure I want to with a game like this as an option. The ebb and flow of investors in the various different countries is fascinating, and simply grabbing the most territory of your favorite (i.e. most heavily invested) country is certainly not a path to winning.

The rules to this game are surprisingly slim and straightforward. The rondel consolidates choices wonderfully, and the game has a great rhythm and flow, with each country taking its turn in order. The last two games I played had plenty of interaction and table talk, and there were distinct moments when the investment of players led to major shifts on the board. 

And lastly, gotta love a game that has a board with a map of the world. Highly recommended.

Update: six plays now, and I'm going to bump this to a 10. I've loved every play of this game, and I expect this will always be in my collection. Another note--we played with the variant without the investor card, and if everyone is a seasoned gamer, that's the way to play.

I really wanted to try this one as it is a 'pure' strategy game without dice or cards. 

31/3/2013 - First play didn't disappoint, and after 5 hours of fairly intense decisions and negotiations the end scoring was close (all within 20 points - which just represented one 4-5 level bond in one of 4 nations at the end which had big scoring at the end). We had two tied scores (with the tie breaker condition being used to break it). 

The game would have ended a lot earlier with a run away leader if the U.S had been left alone for one more round during mid game. Negotiations prevailed however to peg them back, which meant it could have been anyone's game from that point. 

Would like to rate as a 9, but I think the length works against this game.

This game is so dark and yet so beautiful. The gameplay is clever, simple and deep. The rules are sparse but effective.

I've now played about ten bouts of this. I position it into my personal top five games out of a hundred or so I've played. I enjoy playing it very much. The artwork is spot on for the theme and it proceeds very smoothly and is suprisingly easy to play. You need to strategize well and anticipate the actions of your fellow players in order to win.

Because you are not tied to a country it is extremely satisfying to burn through one of them pulling out all the money you can and then buying your way into another country taking over it's leadership. I can't stretch how much I like this mechanic.

Risk meets Acquire with no dice.  Only played once, but enjoyed the game a lot.  

I really liked the ability to forecast the future of a country and the timing of when to invest more.  

Two personal drawbacks:
 
1)  Long game--solid 90 to 120 minutes.
2)  Like Risk, I think there is a good potential that an individual player gets left behind and cannot catch up.  This is discovered about half way through the game and is deflating for that player.  

Definitely need more players.

Well, the old "Risk" has found its natural heir!

Not more a basic area control with a taste of a rough wargame, Imperial 2030 provides a more loggical taste of a wargame (at least, no dice in here!), blended with a strong economic theme that comes not only from the reprodution of a global market but also from the development of each one´s assets.
The rules are straigthfoward and very well builded around the solid Mac Gerdts rondel. The players must antecipate waisely the best moments to launch taxes or take income, etc.
It would be great if the playing time could be shorter (the game can take some 3 hrs) and i also have some doubts about the role of the "swiss" player, i find it somewhat artificial and perhaps unbalanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
After one game:

I really like the concept and mechanics of this game, had a blast playing it. It gives you room to crack a lot of cynical jokes (which is a plus for me) and brings a concept to the table that I haven't seen before - the idea that countries and players aren't one and the same, countries are just marionettes you use as an instrument to acumulate more money, which is exactly as dark as it sounds.

 The game itself does tend to become a little maths-y at times though which might not be for everyone...also, the english manual is very badly worded at times (as far as I can tell, started using the german one as I figured out that its much clearer). I do likee the mechanics quite a bit though, combat and leading a country is surprisingly clean and simple. E ven a point many people seem to be bothered by, the fact that you can be without a country (and become the swiss bank) isn't a downside since the swiss bank is a lot of fun to play whilst also being extremely powerful.

My biggest gripe however are
-the playtime which can be, depending on how likely your friends are to overanalyze, A LOT
- the art. Im not one to usually critisize a bland but effective design, but the components, board and especially the box look so horribly bland. True, it doesnt affect gameplay, but it does affect my 'hunger' to play it - the same problem 'Shogun' suffers from. Madeira, for example, a game with extremely thin theme but great art design feels MUCH more lively than this thematic, but bland-looking game.

An excellent update to the classic Imperial. The rule changes are slight, but combined with the new map make for a much different experience.

Mixed feelings about this one.

On the one hand, the rondel options and the shareholding and economy mechanics work very nicely. Solid gameplay, there.

Unfortunately, the "dudes on a map" portion of the game wasn't very interesting. (In fairness, I generally don't find map-based tactics at all compelling... so if you love map-based maneuvering, you can probably safely ignore my opinion.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
    - Number of games played: 6 2-player games, 3 3-player games and 3 4-player games
    
    - Gameplay and replayability: 3/4. Given the right circumstances, Imperial 2030 can be very enjoyable game. The nations are reasonably well balanced and the mechanics are well thought through. It is a great combination of warfare and economics. A nice aspect is that it is not immediately obvious who is winning, and even near the end you cannot know for sure. However, there are quite a bit of downsides to it, which I will discuss further on.
    
    - Absence of luck: 4/4. Imperial 2030 is luck free. The only luck factor is caused by the decisions made by the other players, but this is inherent to a multiplayer game. With 2 players, this gives a chess-like experience.
    
    - Duration: 1/4. When playing Imperial 2030, players should be forced to play at a fast pace, otherwise the game will drag on and on. The game will easily take 4 or 5 hours if the players take their time to think a little during their turn. With experienced players that are aware of the fact they ought to play rapidly, the game can be cut down to approximately 3.5 hours (with 2 or 3 players). I just don't believe people claiming they can finish the game in less than 3 hours (except for once in a while). We tried to reduce the playing time by starting at level 5 on the power track (playing from 5 to 25 instead of 1-25). However, this makes only a small difference (say half an hour), as the game duration depends largely on whether there is a player willing to end the game.
    
    - Player range: 2/4. Here I have to make a few critical notes. First of all, the game is absolutely no fun at all with 2 players, to the point that I would call it unplayable. There are two reasons for this. First of all, the players' military powers are too balanced, making it very hard for a player to select "taxation" without being punished for it. This fully stalls the game. As if this isn't bad enough, there is the problem that the starting countries aren't evenly balanced. Because of this, it seems to be impossible to stop China-Brasil-Europe from (a slow but steady) victory using Russia-India-US. Swapping nation control is not an option because it is just too hard. On the other hand, with 4 or more players, chances are that some players will have to play the Swiss bank, denying them to play along. As you can guess, this is absolutely no fun at all. For me this is a definite no-no. Also, when playing with more than two, you are heavily dependent on (implicit or explicit) coalitions between players. When you fall behind because of this and don't control any nations anymore (playing the Swiss bank), the game switches from good fun to utter boredom. Moreover, it then becomes very hard to get back into the game, rapidly diminishing your chances of a comeback and increasing the risk of getting little or no playing time at all. 
    
    - Theme and looks: 4/4. The board and the wooden pieces are really beautiful. The theme is exciting (investment and warfare), plausible and it doesn't feel like it was pasted on as an afterthought. 
    
    - Set up/clean up time: 3/4. Setting up the game takes 5 to 10 minutes, and cleaning up is even faster.
    
    - Learning curve and documentation: 3/4. Explaining the rules takes some 30 minutes and it will probably take several games to really grasp them. However, this game is the gold standard for documentation: the rule book is clear and unambiguous and includes a FAQ and even an example game. There are reference cards included and there are also in-game hints. I like that!
       
    - Like: luck free, great mechanic, gorgeous looks, well integrated theme, very well documented.
    
    - Dislike: playing the Swiss Bank ruins the game, unplayable with 2 players, very long.

Still, I enjoyed it and would play again. Also, I think the more open map makes it a better game with 6 players.

Imperial 2030 is straight up one of my favorite games. I love the stock market feel and that you are not locked into a single country but can jump around and take control wherever you'd like. I have had people scream at me for not stopping on a particular action when they needed it, and I love that. Imperial 2030 jacks into a passion that few games can even if the art is not great.

Fascinating: a minimal wargame or a slightly elaborated stock game run on an action wheel/rondel.  It ends up being flexible enough that without any further gimmicks or visible machinery, that the players' personalities end up determining whether war-making or stock-buying will determine the outcome.  Very pacey and for once, in this kind of game, you actually feel like you have time for some kind of strategy to really play out, though from turn to turn you're able to relax into short- and medium-term decisions motivated by what everybody else is doing.

Very interesting game. Only played once without the investor card and it was a bit weird. One player (me) controlled three of the countries for most of the game which lead to a landslide victory. Don't expect that to happen next time we play.

Other than that I really like it. A lot different from many of his other games as you can have money invested in several countries and don't want them to hit on each other.

Must play again and expect the rating to go up. :)

Update: Played again with 6 players. Took us close to three hours which is a bit too long for the fun we had. Would only get a 6 rating here.

on wednesday 8-21-2013 played in Zevenhuizen (The Netherlands) for the first time. With the help of my co-gamers I won this game! thanks Miranda, Pieter,Max & SillyW. I couldn't have done it without your help -;)

Not because that I won, but I really like this game.

There are some good rule changes but overall I don't think it is as good as plain Imperial.  This is mainly due to map changes.  Some nations are able to expand easily where other nations (Russia/China) have to slog through fighting to get financial gains.  I guess there is nothing to prevent buying stock in whomever you think is going to do well, but a 4 share lead in a good nation is tough to overcome.

RATING: 9
Superficially, Imperial 2030 does not appear to be in the same family as the 18xx games. After all, thematically it looks like another "dudes on a map" game with well-crafted wooden military units spreading across the world's lands and seas in a quest for domination. While the board play for these units is important, really Imperial is above all else an investment game, where a combination of cash on hand and investment in the right countries at the end of the game is key to victory. 

Imperial 2030's entry is pretty much interchangeable with that of Imperial's but I slightly prefer the 2030 version of the rules and the world map vs. ye olde Europe map. Imperial is a game of steadily creeping threats, of individuals steadily building up capital to seize control of ripe targets at the apex of their power, that eventually ends in a jagged brutal violence as the limited money situation earlier in the game explodes into rounds of gigantic payouts and attempts to buy into the best stock as the game struggles into the final taxation phase. I like the fact that while on one hand you do not want others to take your well-performing country and deprive you of your taxation income, at the same time doing so makes your fates permanently intertwined, ensuring that they will be seeking to advance your best interests while you are free to move your capital to another target and form another potential alliance. This constant pressure between alliance forming and profit making is a delight to play and the reason why Imperial 2030 is in my Top 10.

Idea: Control countries by investing into them. Players dont have "own" countries, highest investor controls movement but all investors get benefits

Mechanism:
Each player start with control of 1 state. Each turn that state moves by wishes of highest investor (which can change) and either builds up armies, moves them,tax people to get more funds for the country or share invests to investors. New idea is that as you dont own the country if you overdo building someone captures control and moves it if you overdo cashout it doesnt grow. Very neat!

Imperial 2030 is a rondel-based game from Mac Gerdts, he of [thing=124361][/thing] fame.  It is a very original design whereby you own ‘shares’ in nations and the largest ‘share-holder’ is the controller of that nation.   I am not an 18xx player but apparently it is a similar mechanic in that genre of game.  

The downside of this is that there may be rounds where you have nothing to do, if you do not control a nation.  But the upside is that you have to think very differently from other Euros. You need to anticipate Nations which will be successful and buy into them early, and may be build up enough power in them to take over control.  Or you may bleed a nation you control dry in order to get the money out of it and use that to invest in other nations.

Fascinating and a game that demands a different way of thinking from many other Euros.

Az Imperial anno nagyon tetszett. Ezért is voltam kíváncsi a 2030-as verzióra. És ez is jó. Nekem ugyan az esseni 15 eurós verzió van meg (így nyertem 20 eurót, igaz nem kaptam hozzá bábukat, dobozt, s állítólag a játék elemi kisebbek mint az eredetié, de azokkal sem rossz a játék.) Igazából az kell, h mondjam jó döntés volt. Ha valakinek megvan az Imperial nem érdemes megvennie a 2030-t. Túl nagy az átfedés. Viszont ha nincs meg, akkor a 2030-t javaslom megvételre. Pár apró változás, amiből a térkép körbehajózása, az adóztatás jó, no meg a 2 csatorna is annak tűnik - bár ez utóbbit nem nagyon használtuk a játék folyamán, valahogy nem kellett- a svájci banknak pedig lehetnek előnyei.
Szóval a játék kiváló, és úgy érzem kb 5%-nyi finomítás történt rajta, talán, az lehet jó összehasonlítás, h a Ticket to ride széria Európa, és alap verziója közti különbség - sőt inkább annál kevesebb: ott az nagyobb jelentőségű lépés volt, itt tényleg csak finomítás

Imperial 2030 is an incredibly intense, and deceptively deep, economic game disguised as a war game.  

Initial observations - I just love the shifting nature of the shared incentives.  It creates lots of room for some pretty intense head games.  Did I say I love it?

My only real concern is that our games are running a bit long for my group's collective tastes - and that's a real bummer.

I really hope to get this to the table as often as I can though as it's painfully obvious that Imperial 2030 has a ton to offer and is already securing a spot as one of my favorite games.

I played my first game of Imperial/Imperial 2030 without the Investor card and I think that is my preferred way to play. It gives you a lot more control by allowing you to invest after each company takes a turn. I like the tweaks they made here with the tax chart too. 

Overall, it was a satisfying play. I like this game, but don't love it for some reason. I think I prefer the old Diplomacy map with fewer neutral areas so countries have to mix it up sooner and more vigorously.

A perusal of my geekbud ratings has many 10s and 9s, but it doesn't light my fire.

Imperial 2030 is the game Imperial with board and play changes.  

I especially like the Swiss Bank addition which a player owns who does not control a government.  The Swiss can force countries to stop (instead of pass through) on Investor if the country can meet interest payments.  The Swiss can then invest as well.

The board has been modified in several ways that makes navigation easier.  A bond has been added, the extra movement on the Rondel can be more expensive, and there are changes in Taxation.

The game still takes 2 hours to play.

I like the changes and prefer this one and will probably sell Imperial.  I see no reason to keep both.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Again, a comment and rating after a single play. I'm a bit surprised I'm not rating it higher. That's likely because I lost, badly, and never had a good grasp of how to actually win. I find myself attracted to the stock / investment type games, despite not having a very good idea about how to play them well. I keep thinking about this one though, and want to try it again, so I guess I like it?

The main problem I think I have is understanding that running the country (or countries) you control isn't the key to success. Rather, you have to be properly invested in the countries that are succeeding. In fact, there's probably a way to win that involves running a country you control into the ground to make the rest of your investments look good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Initial impression:  It's hard to say it's any better or worse than Imperial at this point.  There's less differentiation between the countries which is interesting in that more countries tend to battle over the same territory.  Personally I like the more asymmetric nature of the original, but I do like the greater freedom in 2030.  The extra bond is nice.  The CEO bonus is definitely different.  People will still try to steal it, but it doesn't hurt so bad as in the original.  The most notable difference is that this encourages more taxation earlier in the game and I rather enjoy the new balance of keeping money in your treasury.  I would even go so far as to say this is the defining point of 2030 vs. regular Imperial.

Best stock holding-fighting-territory acquisition game. Highly original idea & thoroughly enjoyable. The genius aspect to this game relates to act of investing in countries, then actually undertaking actions for them, that may ultimately benefit your investment, and/or hurt others who have done the same (with other countries). One can also run them into the ground in order to hurt other players' stake in them. Countries can switch hands regardless of whatever actions a player has undertaken.  I prefer it to the original Imperial mostly because the map is wide open (no blocked off ends), with a few more extra neutral areas.

EXTEMELY long game that you have to learn how to play. Old habits from other titles just make it harder for you to win in this one. You are not a nation - the nations are your tool to make money. Or more money. Or so much money you can't even imagine.

The game is very good and I enjoyed it. The problem is the lenght of a gameplay and somewhat slow beginning that can take more than an hour.

But the rules are rather simple and the gameplay itself pretty rewarding.

Five stars is really an unfair rating as this game is in no sense of the word mediocre. However, the description of "take it or leave it" fits how I feel about I2030. The problem for me is that I2030's decision spaces create a certain type of game stress that I don't find enjoyable. Now, this does not prevent me in seeing how this is an interesting push and pull of a game that others would find extremely enjoyable. However, it is just not for me. 

Having played Gerdts' Navegador a couple months ago, I found I liked the decisions of Navegador more interesting on a personal level, yet I liked the (somewhat) less fiddly nature of taxation and investing in I2030 compared to Navegador's constantly fluctuating market and subsequent payouts.

Ten plays, and I have also played regular Imperial a couple of times. 

Imperial 2030 takes the best features of stock-market games and world-conquest gamse and combines them into something new and exciting. Players represent ultra-wealthy kabillionaires who lend money to the six world powers in order to fund their imperialist expansionism. The player who has loaned the most money to a power gets to run the government; in this way players are influencing their "stocks" by pushing armies around the map and butting heads with their neighbors. This creates lots of interesting player interaction as alliances and rivalries are born, and there is lots of scope for strategic thinking.

Some folks call I2030 an 18xx game, and while there are many similarities the comparison is not completely apt, since you can't really tank a superpower in the same way that you can loot a railroad. Players will often overextend a superpower's influence just before taxation, but this doesn't turn it into a bad investment. 

One last thing I'll say is that some people have criticized the game because it's possible for a player to win by purposely avoiding control of any government in order to hold onto the Swiss investor card and snap up all the cheap leftover stocks at the end, which also seems to go against the spirit of the game. This is less a fault of the game and more a fault of the players' strategies, however; players should avoid "trading up" bonds carelessly—particularly as the cheaper bonds have a higher payout per cost; two loans of six million have a combined interest of 6, whereas one loan of 12 has an interest of five.

I definitely agree that some countries are better than others, and this is the only thing that stops me from rating the game a "10". For this reason, I liked the variant by which players buy their starting holdings rather than having it left up to chance.

As far as the deal number of players, the only thought I have is that it's probably less good with six than it is with four or five; certainly it works, but it can feel bit bogged down at times, plus the countries can change hands so often that there might not be a lot of continuity. On top of that, visits by the investor card are more infrequent, so if you don't have quite enough money for a purchase when it comes around to you, it's a pretty big blow. I've never tried it with three.

I'll rate this like I rated Imperial. 
Unfortunately I've played Imperial too long ago to remember and so to make a good comparison of the two games. 

So is Imperial 2030 better than Imperial?
I don't know. 

Did I like Imperial 2030, yes. It is long but it is always shifting. It is an interesting game, so I'll give it a "7".

UPDATE
I don't enjoy this game unfortunately - even if I won. It is long and tough to chew and I don't get out of it as much as I need to pour into it. 

That said it is a brilliant game, but didn't work for me.

Imperial 2030 is a great game.  It's easy to learn, but hard to master.  All actions in the game are under full control of the players, the only luck in the game is what stocks you get at the start.  
This game is about trying to convince the other players to do what you want.  About trying to predict what the other players will do.  About seeing the interactions between the nations and predicting how it will effect them.  
It's about timing: Knowing when to take control of a nation and when to spent resources elsewhere.  When to push the game to a conclusion that is to your favor.  
This game takes on the traits and vicissitudes of it's players.  Alliances and animosities come about naturally, by players mutual interests.  

Games like this are the reason I play board games.

This game has a quite unique gameplay and is more about timing than anything else. While I find it interesting, it can take hours and be frustrating, if your timing is off. Problem with the timing is, that you don't have much influence on it. It depends mostly on the other players.

Haven't played but looked through it - Doesn't appear to be different enough for me to own both.  I'd love to get ahold of the expansion pack version though.

UPDATE:  A friend who played tells me the addition of more neutral territories means it takes longer for each nation to maximize its income potential and the addition of the bigger bonds makes wresting control from another player less easy.  These comments make me less interested in the game since I really like the original.  Eventually I'll get to play it myself and draw my own conclusions, I'm sure.

RATING: 9
WOW! This is an area control game, as well as a stock game, and a game with elements of a war game. Still, you have to keep in mind in essence this is an investment game, where you have to optimize the return on your investments. 

If you play this game as a war game, you will loose as you will not be able to expand your influence sufficiently, and the wars will drain resources and money. This game actually reminds me more of an 18xx game than any war game. Invest in the countries where you see the highest potential for growth and expansion. If you are able to build informal alliances with the closest neighbor power(s) on the map, chances are that you will have some success. The game is vey dynamic, as contol of the differenent countries may change several times during the game. 

Fascinating game and very good components. The rondel mechanism is interesting. This is really one of my favorite games.

After 4 plays, this game is really good. Rating 9.5. The strategies that you can do are pretty cool. Plenty of interaction and zero luck involved. Be prepared to think about multiple paths to victory in this one. The FFA aspect of this game makes alliances tenuous at best. Not for the faint-hearted!
Downgraded to 9.0 after 12 plays. No randomness isn't as much fun as I would like. 
Downgraded to 8.0 as the lack of luck novelty has worn off.

1st real life play after a couple online. I love this game. As a geeky treat it's worth a 9.5 or thereabouts but unfortunately it's heavier than antike (a game which is rarely played at home due to it's weight) and it's longer too than most games.

There is therefore little point me getting this or the original Imperial as they are both owned by my gaming circle and too involved for home games. On this basis I find it difficult to move on my original ratings for either game.

Got it for xmas 2011, it has become rather unfortunately the only game to ever make my girlfriend cry :( which sucks because if anything I've liked it more and more with every play

Upgraded to a 10 when I relooked down the list of 9.5s

---

Thoughts on tactics after 200+ plays. It is not a pure war game, nor is it a pure investment game. It is both and needs to be played in a balanced way in order for it to be properly enjoyed.

Unfortunately if the majority of the players at the table choose to play it as a wargame then the best war merchant will win and a balanced strategy will not simply because the constant slug of war moves the investment chip more slowly. Similarly if the majority of players play it as an investment game then a balanced game will not succeed as that powerful nation will be bought out.

In most good games the balanced strategy wins out but with this it completely depends on the meta. Online there has been a shift towards the balance which means you're surrounded by players and you're looking for marginal gains against them - any step towards all out war/investment will be countered quickly. I find this meta extremely rewarding; the game is incredibly deep and deserves a 9.5/10.

On Sunday gaming at Sheridans we've arrived at a balanced strategy too.

In Grimsby though we're 2/3 games in amongst good gamers yet are stuck playing it as a wargame. As a pure wargame or a pure investment game it's a 7 at best.

Strategies that move the meta towards a pure wargame; first turn factory, regular use of both production and both manoeuvre spaces (which also slows down the wheel and therefore slows down the investments), use of the import space, reinvestment in countries you already control, war between 2 countries you have shares in (I'd call this tunnel vision of only looking at what you're controlling)

Where that first factory is built is crucial to how the game will develop too. Brazil desperately needs more ships to reach Africa, if someone builds the tank factory then it locks Brazil into a war with the USA. America also needs more ships for Atlanic dominance/reaching Africa. How these three play out which factories are built is interesting. Russia building a factory in Murmansk and also involving itself in a fight for the North Atlantic as a third favourite is suicide. India doubling its ship output into an ocean it already has exclusivity to is equally stupid. Finally Europe NEEDS tanks to get significant gains in Africa before the others.

There's a lot to be said for playing one nation in a warlike manner. For instance, if China hammers Russia, while India flourishes and you own China and India then you're doing very well - but the trick here is to buy China off that player before he manoeuvres.

Strategies that make for a pure investment game; first turn investor, one or multiple players opting to play as the Swiss bank and sweep up all of the low value high percentage shares, investing to win a war via diplomacy rather than guns, investing into countries that are just about to tax or invest for maximum payout, quick pace round the wheel ie tax-produce-invest-manoeuvre-tax... 

I think in the right environment where you all understand these subtleties and love the game then it's a 9.5 or outright 10. But in any other case it's a 7 at best so I'll probably wind up playing it less and resenting its unloved brilliance in the same way I do with Chicago express for example.

Re-rated to an 8.5 and I've changed imperial down to an 8 too. I love them to bits but I'm much less keen to play them :(

RATING: 7
This is a complex blend of Antike and a 18xx-type train stock game, set in a world similar to Supremacy. Like Imperial, it was somewhat difficult to grasp the concept that I am not some particular country, but that I am an investor. The majority stakeholder gets to run the country's economic and military actions. Thus, it is possible to win the game without owning any one particular country, but having sufficient diversification in a number of well-performing countries, or specialization in one country that is outperforming others. However, putting all your eggs in one basket can be risky, as others will be compelled to attack your country to reduce its rate of stock value growth.

The production values from Rio Grande are very good, as usual. The board is striking and futuristic, although it would have been nice to have more of the stylings of Supremacy. 

The gameplay is somewhat constrained early on, and continues more so throughout the game. One cannot build massive amounts of units, like they did in Antike, because of overhead. Countries must build factories, to build units, to secure territory, to tax conquered territories, in order to generate dividend income based on the amount of bonds held by each player, as well as increase the intrinsic value of each bond. There is another meta-game of bond-ownership, where the investor marker goes around the table, giving each player an very limited opportunity to increase their stake in one country, or buy a bond in another country. They are essentially placing bets on the relative performance of a given country, and hence the relative ability of the player that controls said country.

The theme of nations being manipulated by hidden financial interests somehow seems more appropriate to the modern age, but shortcomings from the base game are still here. There's a larger number of neutrals this time, but starting positions are by no means equal with Russia in particular being well boxed in. Somehow the whole idea is still lacking something for me, there's not enough incentive for a major war between the powers, you just squabble around the edges of your empire. The appearance of yet another rondel game is making Mac Gerdts look seriously like a one-trick pony to me, and an increasingly tired trick at that.

Don't be confused by the box: This is really not a 6 player game. All countries starting with a dominant shareholder tends to mean players just strengthen their holding in their start country, and thus no countries can change hands. The game is therefore reduced to a dull wargame.

With 4 or 5 (ideally 4) the game is much more interesting, as the shares and economics become the focus of the game. Invest in the right countries, and extract as much cash as you can from those you control, while still trying to get them a good end-game bonus.

I can't really say I see much of a need for Imperial 2030 in a world where Imperial already exists.  I don't feel the rules changes affect the game in a meaningful way, and the map just kind of annoys me.  Things are just too spread out - in the game I played one country controlled the entire continent of Africa uncontested for about half the game because it was too difficult for anyone else to get over there.  I much prefer the original crowded map of Europe, which encourages more interaction between countries.  I still give it a 7 because the core of the Imperial system is still there and the game is still fun, but I wouldn't choose 2030 over the Original Recipe if both were in front of me.

Imperial is a streamlined world domination game with a focus on the financial aspect. The rondel mechanism for actions requires more than superficial planning, and being able to purchase stock in other countries forces other players to watch their own progress.

Interaction: 10 out of 10
There is really nothing a player can do that does not affect other players. If a player makes a mistake, for example, it may not only affect the military situation on the world map. It can even make this country a less attractive investment option. If I wanted to invest in this country and take over the government, I would prefer other pptions after this error. Due to the military aspect the interaction in Imperial 2030 is much more confrontational in comparison with most Euro games. This can lead to lively discussions in which players try to manipulate each other.

Fun : 9 out of 10 
With the right players the strong interaction in Imperial 2030 is lot of fun. It is pleasantly complex, you have to make difficult decisions under uncertainty, taking into account even the psychology of the players. Although the rules are relatively easy to understand (for experienced players at least :) the game has a high strategic depth. An egg timer helps us to avoid analysis paralysis. Otherwise a game session can easily last for about 3-4 hours if not more. Players who do not like political games, probably won’t love Imperial 2030.

In our game round Imperial 2030 is one of our favorite games!

Replayability: 7 out of 10
Each game starts with the very same setup. There is the same world map and the same investment options. So the start of each game can feel a bit repetitive. Different playing styles of players and a different number of players still forces you to always be flexible and adapt your strategy to to the constantly changing circumstances. Due to the high degree of interaction you can not just stubbornly follow a plan but must respond to the actions of the other players and change your plans if necessary.

Didn't really notice differences from original, but know a couple things got tweaked and from memory this one seemed not quite as wonky (but you can still be without a country here rest assured). 

One guy we played with said the game felt like the cool parts of Risk with the crappy parts removed, that isn't a bad summary, I would add that it also combines the stock investing parts of Acquire, then this comes a little closer to fully describing it.  Turns go fast, simple rules, no luck, so an interesting stock market game with a slight war element.

A new map and ruleset.  Several rules are changed, which I generally find neither improvements nor detriments.
  
The taxation bonuses are smaller but take effect every time, so have a different dynamic than Imperial where the incentive is to control a country about to make its first big taxation.  The map is more expansive; this probably suits a player like me better since I'm more interested in investing than attacking, but it's hard to say that's an improvement, just a difference.

The Swiss Bank I don't like.  I don't think the no-country strategy needed the help and it seems fundamental to the game that a country's controller gets to decide on roles - the Swiss Bank undermines that.

Still, a worthy game which I'll be happy to play whenever it hits the table.

It's been a long time since I last played Imperial, but about a third of the way through my first play of 2030 it all came back. Because it';s essentially the same game. Which s a (very) god thing.

Not sure you'd need both in your collection, though, so I'll probably stick with my original edition - I prefer the historical setting, and the larger bond cards help my aging eyes.

This is a smart game.  What's more is that I also had fun with it.  If your group can commit to a 3 or 3 and a half hour game I'd recommend it.  I'm not sure that adding players would really add that much time to the game either.  That said I've only played this with 3.

A well-designed game which is surprisingly streamlined considering the complexity of the system. Despite  appearances, this is an investment not war game. You don't have a side per se, only shares of various sides. You have to balance investments, taxation, military, expansion, war, invasion, etc.  Nice "checks and balances", reminds me of a Rosenberg game.  But you have to be in the mood for this kind of brain-burner. The infamous "Rondel" mechanic by which the controlling interest executes a function by moving-round-a-circle is neat.

I rate Imperial a 10. The rule changes from Imperial all work well. The Swiss Bank makes this a clearly better game at the higher player counts since it grants a little extra power to those who do not control a country. I'm not 100% sure I like this board layout over the original. It appears that some countries, like Brazil, are significantly better positioned than others, like Europe and China, to improve their tax base. The same could be said of the original board, but because there are so many tax regions available here, the difference between the haves and have-nots appears to be greater. For that, I'm giving Imperial a slight edge over this, but both are worth owning if you love the game, like I do!

My favorite rondel game so far. I love the dynamics of having everyone not playing a particular country but rather buying shares and sharing the benefits of each one.

I like this version of Imperial at least as much as the original (2006) game, which makes it one of my favourite games at the moment.

Having more neutral spaces delays the clash of nations for a while, to the benefit of the game, which has time to get going before anyone starts squabbling over territory. The board feels more open and forgiving. The taxation - bonus - power-track rules and layout are greatly improved. 

Otherwise my comments are the same as for the original Imperial. I haven't played either game without the Investor card.

I enjoyed the game.  Rating is definitely a high six; I wavered at giving it a seven which actually might be more accurate.  I have played it's predecessor and while that experience was not as compelling it was more likely due to the particulars of the play rather than the game itself.  So since I like the setting of regular Imperial better I would opt for that one if I felt compelled to buy this title.

Litt som RISK eller Diplomacy, men strømlinjeforma kampsystem med 1 for 1 i staden for terningkast. Kapitalist-system i staden for å kontrollere land. Interessanne utval av strategiar der det lønner seg å enten kjøpe opp obligasjoner i motspelerens nasjon eller tømme statskassene for pengar og putte det i eiga lomme. Særleg interessant at strategiar med militærmakt aleine ofte er ulønnsomt!

Excellent companion to Imperial. Some minor rule tweaks like Swiss Bank, rondel costs in function of the power strength and taxation from the treasury. Of course, also a different game map with more room for expansion. Only played without investor card.

Pretty much like regular Imperial but with more neutral countries which is appreciated.  Played the game with the correct mindset this time, but I still don't know if I find the game enjoyable for the amount of time it takes to play.  This is one of those classic games that I want to like but generally end up feeling slightly discontent afterwards...might just be the rondel - I have rarely found rondel games to be of much interest to me.

RATING: 9
I would never have imagined that, while there are some significant differences, this game would be SO similar to the original. I certainly need to go back and play that game again, but for all intents purposes I think the map alone makes this a superior animal. 

One thing I have never tried though is the investor variant, and having played this series again I can think of so many reasons that I might want to play either way. There are some incredible timing considerations when playing with it, and I feel like there might be too many changes to control of nations without it; so what I'm saying is that, at this point, I think I'm in favor of the investor.

Economic game pretending to be a war game.  The roundel is simple to use and exploit.  I was surprised with how little change of control there was regarding the nations, though that might have just been my experience.  I feel like the set turn order for the nations is a weakness of the game; some countries just get screwed by their neighbors' relative position in turn order.

A Mac Gerdts rondel game.  It is a stock game, masquerading as a war game.  The game is set in the modern world.  The map is less tight then Imperial.  Also, I think there are some balance issues where I have seen Brazil consistently outperform and India almost never do well.  It could be the players I play with and their preferences.  I do enjoy the game but give a slight edge to Imperial.

4 hours where not enough to finish a 5 player game. 

I had played the original Imperial game and had good memories about it. But they were not continued by playing this 2030 version. Maybe it were the circumstances while playing that were not ideal.

Not enough rythm in the gameplay. Kept on going on and on without much happening. Maybe that was because of the Inverstor token that we used (which I believe, is optional).

Very nice war-like game with a strong financial aspect. One can snatch victory by investing on solid countries at the final rounds, but at the same time she won't be able to do this if he countries she controls don do well to provide him money.

Excellent game that is a fascinating mix of dudes on a map and share ownership, with some rondel goodness. High level of complexity trying to figure out what everyone else might be doing, so risk of analysis paralysis.

Cynical theme, long, group-thinky.  There are other games like Acquire, Airlines Europe, etc. that have a similar premise and don't take as long to play nor have an arms dealing theme.

I've done well in not one, but two, learning games where I spent much of my turns asking questions about what I should do. This tells me a lot either about myself or about the game or both. I don't think I need to play this again.

Enjoyable game of world domination where your moves on the map aren't as important as the investments you make.  I love how alliances come and go as investor control over each country changes hand.  When all's said and done it's pretty much the same game as the original but the rules have been streamlined and some of the investor card timing questions have been worked out.  The map has changed a bit: the home countries are smaller, there are more neutral territories and canals.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
I like the idea of this game very much. You aren't fixed to one country to conquer the world. You can buy your shares in every worldpower and if you own the most you can determine it's course in world domination. Sometimes it's even interesting to let your country crash and burn as part of a strategy. 

But timing is everything in this game. You can't buy shares whenever you want in the base game (you can ofcourse change the rules to optimise for the number of players). You have a very limited number of opportunities to buy additional shares and it's important that you have enough money when it's your turn to go shopping.

There is no real luck factor in the game. But a lot of your luck depends on your opponents. You can't win this game if nobody wants to invest in your country (despites your attempts to make it appealing). However, you can win, owning no country. Dividing your investments over many countries is usually a better strategy than invest it all in one. So you have to be a bit lucky with the choices others make.

Overall... i want to like this game more than i usually enjoy playing it. It usually takes about 3 hours to determine the winner although we finished it within an hour as well. My point being: The game can be boring at certain times, usually when one or two players control the most of the powers. He/she/they have to make a lot of important choices and there's nothing more you can do but await the outcome of that. At other times it is more balanced and a lot more exciting. Certainly when it's hard to predict which country will win in the end. It can be quite inpredictabel who wins before you multiplied and added all the scores.

Despites all the disadvantages: It's a game I always want to play. I will not decline an offer.But it helps playing with the right persons. Analysis paralysis is always looking around the corner and you don't want the people susceptible to that to be in control of more than one country. ;)

My fear is that it takes too long for what it is. Its elegant on one side, the components are great but the map might get a little bit too crowded after a while. Would be a great online game, because there is a lot of handling with the money.

The game is excruciatingly long with players who think it's a wargame with money. It becomes fairly quick but tedious with players who think it's just about the cash. Then it becomes long again with players who realize the primacy of cash but try to eke out little advantages here and there through the wargame aspect. At this point some veterans claim the game transforms into a "negotiation" game. Fair enough.

Despite my lack of excitement, I remain intrigued enough by this title to want to play it every once in a while.

I think I prefer [boardgame=24181][/boardgame]'s board, but the difference is minor enough that I give both games the same rating.

A long game which plays quickly? Imperial works really well, provided that you remember that you do not "own" a country, you just have an investment in one - so there is little loyalty. If another country is more promising, then buy into that one and forget your old one!

Should I buy this or the original Imperial?

The idea of using common resources (in this case, the imperial powers ) to further your own interests sounds very intriguing. Some players claim that this is the eurofication of an 18XX game (https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/372160/ultimate-eurogame) and the relatively short playing time may make this easier to get to the table.

Update: I eventually bought the original Imperial but still wants to play its successor.

An unusual gaming experience, as what you keep doing in the game and the goal of the game are actually not too connected at first glance. You know how to invest best for your return, but there's nothing certain in the game.

The updated version of Imperial, where the superpowers are now Russia, China, Brazil, India, USA, and Europe. The map is different and there are a couple minor rule modifications. The power points are not calculated relative to what you scored the previous time, so the game closes a little faster.  The game still depends on people to police each other to a certain degree, and you could get attacked unfairly. If you can handle that, the stock mechanism of the game leads to a lot of tension and agnst. 

I'm not particularly good at this game, but I'll play when asked to try and improve.

My games have taken 3 hours.  I don't really feel a lot of satisfaction when I win, since it feels more like the country that moves up on the power track the highest is the winner, and not me.  The length of the game should give the winner a better feeling since you've invested so much thought and time into the game.  The turn actions can sometimes seem lackluster, but nevertheless it keeps me engrossed.

This game caught me completely by surprise.  I sat down to the table knowing nothing about it.  What I found was a deeply strategic game with a simple, easy to learn design.  I cannot wait to play again.

Update: Several plays later remains one of my favorite.  Got that somewhat abstract Euro-crunch for europlayers and some nice Ameritrashy screw your neighbor mechanisms and combat.

Brilliant game, but quite difficult to understand the deeper tactics. Very easy to learn and teach. "Easy to learn - hard to master". No luck involved (which is amazing!)

Update 2016: Reduced 10->9 simply because it is too long and I can't get it to the table.

RATING: 3
Possibly seriously flawed in terms of early leaders running away with it, and it essentially being pointless for the rest. Our game lasted 3 1/2 hours, and was only remotely interesting for the first two hours at best. Maybe if all players are equally proficient, it might be a bit more of an equal fight. Maybe.

On the plus side, that one play saved me £40, and a ton of regret!

Imperial 2030 (as its predecessor Imperial) is a wonderful game, a classic, a game that should be in the top ten of BGG.

It offers a lot of very interesting strategic choices, with a huge decision space, open to creative play. Players are investing in nations, and nations pay dividend based on their success rating in conquering part of the world.  Nations are controlled by the player who has more shares. But nations and players have not the same objectives: playing this game as a wargame is likely a way to lose.

Incredibly clean and simple rules for a game of this depth. The famous rondel fragments the nation's activities in tiny actions: each action can usually be played very fast, so there is usually no long waiting times. It is exciting to play. It scales incredibly well from 3 to 6 (because all nations are always in the game, whatever the number of players). There is absolutely no luck involved in the game.

I play it without the investor card and IMHO this is by far the best way to play the game.

There are little changes compared with Imperial, but I prefer Imperial 2030, especially because in my opinion the map offers more interesting and balanced strategical choices (and it is more beautiful too).

RATING: 7
It was maybe 2.5 years ago that I first played Imperial and thought it fantastic. Despite surface resemblances to Risk, so much more depth. And that theme -- we play members of the shadowy banking cartels that control the nations of the world via debt. 2.5 years later it hasn't held up as well. The game sags a great deal in the middle, and there's more downtime than I remembered. Still, there's something to respect about the brilliant abstraction between country and investor -- the country does what the primary investor wants it to do, which may not always be in the country's best interest (draining coffers, kamikaze armies). Also, the combat system is a plus -- simple, and I don't take it personally when someone reduces the territory of a country I control, because abstraction

I'm beginning to think I just don't like rondel games.  It's the forced cycle of action.

In the meantime, there's a meaty little game here that's not quite econ game, not quite war game, not quite negotiation game.  It requires a specific audience, though.  And given my audience for econ games, I'll stick with Power Grid.

RATING: 7
slightly better for me than the original game and I think it is probably not worth owning both.
differences:
taxation bonus amount is different, the bonus is paid from the treasury of the nation and does not require improvement of taxation,
extra movement on the rondel becomes costlier as a nation moves up on the power scale,
players without control of a nation will get a swiss bank, that can force nations to stop at the investor action and pay out interest if possible
more conquerable areas on the wraparound map, which is less confrontative than the original one and has two canals where passage is allowed or disallowed by the nation controlling the land area next to them
nations have four home regions and can have a maximum of four factories
30 m bond with 9 m payout added

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I enjoyed the changes in this version. I think the added cost to move the rondel for strong countries was a good idea. I'm not sure how I feel about Swiss players being able to force investor. I prefer the alternate investor rules anyway. The differences in the map give plenty of room to work out what the best strategy for each country would be, it's not just a clone of the first game. Smaller home countries force you to expand more, you can't just build your factories to boost your tax. I also like the fixed tax bonus, this'll probably bring the sniping down a little bit, although it's still worth it to steal a country from someone.

RATING: 9
(I own "upgrade pack" only)
First impression (4 players) : There are only a couple different rules compared to original Imperial. Main difference is that game is more offensive as there are more neutral territories to conquer or fight for. It'll be clear after several more games if this is as balanced game/map as the original. It is a good game/map to own even if you already have Imperial. The gameplay is diversed enough from the original.

Gioco che voglio riprovare perché, seppur i meccanismi sono fluidi e semplici, mi è sembrato lento e poco coinvolgente. Le repentine scalate azionarie lo rendono non semplice da governare. Questo, che potrebbe essere il suo punto di forza, va compreso, digerito e assemblato con diverse partite. Un gioco tosto che al momento però rimando alla prossima prova.

Setting is VERY AWFUL! Com'on, Brazil which dominates world's seas and Russia that establishes permanent colonies in Australia. :-(
Mechanics is very interesting and original. I don't have enough experience to feel the differences with Imperial. As usual, I do not appreciate the "attack him, not me pleeease" effect, which however here is mitigated by the common ownership of countries.
Another aspect which I do not like is the ping-pong effect when a player owns two bordering countries.

RATING: 8
Awesome! Although it sounds pretty dry at first, there is an exciting and fresh, interactive cutthroat and CYNIC game hidden under what seems to be a standard area control mechanism. No doubt: It is one of the best ones I know. 

Drawbacks: In unfortunate moments (when you're out of cash!), you may become the Swiss Bank. That is a dreadful situation, because without cash, you won't have a single turn for quite a while. You'll have to wait for income, which may take a looong time in the middle and end game. It's an auto-loser. A similar experience is when you're stuck with a defeated nation.

Tactics and strategy: 
- Try to get a good combo, and use one nation as a watchdog for the other. 
- Don't let yourself distract by unit movements. It all comes down to timing (investor, investments, government change and taxation). 
- China, EU and Russia are harder than India, US, and Brazil. Brazil and US together are a winner.
- Try to negotiate. This can result in decisive changes of game dynamics, and makes the game a lot more social.
- Use the advanced rules for initial credits
- Investor Card: Not using the IC makes it a different game, but I wouldn't say it's always better. 

HOUSE RULES
- Having one more initial government is a significant advantage. So, in order to maintain equal chances with 4 or 5 players, never use the country cards to distibute the initial bonds. Make the auction instead.
- first turn: place all pawns on the Investor field (as if the pawns had been moved there in the previous round). Rationale: Taking the investor seems to be the best first move - if just one player does it, all others will follow. --> Not good!
- EU's initial shipyard is adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea.
- Players hide cash. This makes the game more challenging.
- If NOT using the investor card, try "first player to the left of the government player makes first investment"?
- Swiss bank may ALWAYS stop a country on "Investor"?
- Allow putting flags in home territories?

Same rating as the original as it provides the same experience. The noticeable tweaks are a world map instead of Europe, more chances to invest if you don't own a country (nice), better owner bonuses for when you trigger taxation, and it's more expensive to do the end-game taxation-investor loop, causing the end-game to go a bit longer and giving some extra time for other nations to catch up maybe. All of which can be applied back to the original if you like, and none of which make much difference to the experience. The rondel of actions forces each of the 6 countries through cycles of troop expansions, deployment and payouts. The gameplay is to determine which countries are going to be safest from attack (perhaps because the players invested in that country control neighbouring countries) and then invest in it as much as you can because it can cycle to the payout phase quicker rather than having to spend turns defending. The other aim is to build semi-alliances with other players - having multiple investors in a country you control diminishes the chances of it being attacked. There are good decisions to be had when choosing the next rondel action for a country. It's dullsville when you don't have a country. As a result, the game might shine with experienced players, but it's a harsh beast for those players who fail to develop a controlling interest or fail to build helpful alliances. The end of game scoring can also be harsh when being just 1 turn slow can make a big difference in the multiplier you receive. It's a game I respect, but not one I overly enjoy due to its harshness and over-reliance on reading alliances well. If you had to choose between the newer and the original, you'd go with new, but the differences aren't enough to warrant trading up if you have the original. Also, where's the 2030 come from? It could just as easily be Diplomacy 1901 given the amount of negotiation, table talk if you will, about where to draw the lines on expansion. Anyway, it's a touch too long for what it offers, but overall a decent game.

Since 3,5years i love to play this game. Espacially the shifting control of the nations is a very special mechanic. 
There is no luck in this game, but it always seems the game has its own A.I. on which nation is rising and which is beyond its zenit. But this depends only on the investments and conflict based on players actions.

Do not compare it to Risk! It has a longer learning effect and is a lot deeper.

For the last two years this was always in my top3 of Games I want to play (along with f.e. Eclipse)

RATING: 7
Based on one play: An investment game where buy up bonds of countries that you and the other players also control. There is fighting, but it is fairly simple (one unit kills another) and won't win you the game. You want to invest in the countries that are controlling the most with the least resources.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game with a nice combination of cooperation and competition. The biggest drawback to me is that the opportunities to buy bonds are just a little too few and far between. I'm not sure how I would fix it, but waiting for the investor card to make its way around the table was a bit restrictive.  I also think the game goes a tad long for what it is.  It would be a good 90 minute game, but our sessions tend to push 3 hours.  Yes, you do see nations spreading out all over the map, but it still feels a bit repetitive after about 12 to 15 rounds.

Good solid cross between an economic, area control and light war game. In Imperial 2030, each player is an investor who takes control of governments-- sending its people off to war, collecting taxes or building factories and improving goods. I like the Rondel mechanic and have enjoyed all the games I've played in the series... I found Hamburgum slightly more satisfying overall but I liked Imperial 2030 better than Navegador.

World domination isn't generally my schtick, but I really enjoyed this.

3 or 4 players only. The total number of investor card's rotations doesn't depend on the number of players. So, with more players, you receive the investor card less often. With 5 players, you don't receive the card often enough: only 5 times, maybe only 4 times. And with 6 players, only 3 times for some players, 4 times for the luckiest.

6 player area control game where you don't represent a country or faction, merely an investor, so based on your investments you can change control of who is playing which country. It can happen that you have no country and have a hard time buying back into being able to participate in the game. It's impossible to manage your own fate. At any point you could have your plans dashed by another invading country or having someone buy your country out from under you, and there isn't a lot of recourse. Too chaotic.

I played this only once so I am not the best of judges but this did not really appeal to me. It is basically a mixture of acquire and risk, buying into countries while using the units to conquer territories. I found the game a bit dry and the rondell mechanic not very elegant, I would have rather had a classic turn order in which all players/countries resolve the same actions. This way, the game would be more tactical and less strategic. Also, it can be quite unbalanced and take too long and there is a lot of downtime should you be so unlucky and end up being Switzerland. Not a bad game but there are many similar games out there which are much better

According to Lenin the highest form of capitalism is Imperialism - where the pursuit of capital transcends national borders and creates geopolitical conflict through the exploitation of militant Nations to conquer and tax other nations. 
With the rise of Imperialism, world wars become marketing vehicles for Nations to advertise their power and convince international investors to buy war bonds, further fueling their economies.

Through relatively simple mechanics, Imperial is able to deliver to us an amazingly nuanced (and fun!) first-hand demonstration of Lenin's philosophy.
Honestly, regardless of if the real world implications curdle your blood or not, Imperial ought to be taught in every school.

The most cynical game I have ever played.  Abandon your allegiances, your loyalties, your friends and enemies alike.  Just buy into a nation on the rise, and run it into the ground, but not before you realize a healthy return.  Tremendously tense, unpredictable action without the aid of any hidden information.  A brilliant design that is easy to explain, and fun to play again and again.

RATING: 6
As someone who hates area control and war games, I was impressed that Imperial 2030 took the bite out of those genres by giving every player a chance to invest in the winning "faction." That being said, the game can get really nasty if players take away your controlling stock in a region and force you to become the Swiss bank at a moment where you don't have the funds to invest in anything. When that happens, prepare to be stuck in last place for the remainder of a 2-3 hour long game. 

Personally, I'd rather play Mombasa for a game that has a similar feel, but a bit more balance and control.

Good rondel strategy game.  Simple and fast to teach and has a unique aspect in which its money that wins in the end, not how well you "country" does.

RATING: 9
There are great nuances baked into its simple and elegant rules, without any fiddly stuff such as text on cards etc.

I love this but I'm awarding it 9/10, not 10/10. This is because it can have a lot of kingmaking, can feel a bit amorphous and some players can get into a situation where they've less to do than others.

You control warring nations but there's a huge, fundamental twist on the usual wargame formula: you constantly modify your commitment to each nation (via buying 'bonds' to invest in them). You have full control of any country(s) only while you are their current top investor. There are no permanent loyalties in this game. You only care about 'your' countries until you switch to other countries that might make you more money.

The simple bond-buying mechanism produces seamless, fun interaction. For example:
1) Bonds create an elegant pseudo-diplomatic structure. Players are less likely to send their current nations to invade (and potentially cripple) other nations in which they also own bonds. So players can, for example, choose to indicate their benevolence by buying bonds in neighbouring countries. A quick glance at players' bonds cards reveals their subtle national/geographical priorities.
2) Your relationship with nations is amusingly parasitic and dystopian. It's quite common to make a nation harm itself (for example by suiciding its military) just because you worry that someone else might be about to take control of it, especially if it borders a nation you're much more invested-in.
3) Cheap bonds are weighted to provide a much higher 'return on investment' then expensive ones. It can cause an interesting situation where a player controlling a nation actually cares less about it than other players who bought more, smaller bonds in it. On such occasions, it's common for the player to simply exploit the nation to support his/her other ones ... then get out fast.

There's also A LOT of military fighting, which is all incredibly quick to resolve. It's claustrophobic, like rats fighting in a barrel. The bonds system means that this warfare has a strong negotiation aspect. There's a lot of chatty, light player interaction. There's no material trading between players, so it's all about checking who you trust and who's making promises.
 
The rondel system is interesting too because it restricts (but not dictates) the options available to each country at any given time. I like how the rondel is asymmetrical: nations cycling past the 6 o'clock position have better options to raise armies, invade, and then quickly tax the invaded territories. So watch out for players whose countries are at that 'less benevolent' half of the rondel!

In conclusion. A feisty game full of elegant, simple mechanisms that produce plenty of challenges, begging, battles and 'reading the market' in the space of about 3 hours (less if you're quick).

Quite heavy Euro game with a neat twist: You are not the leader of one nation, but you become a leader (several nations) if you invest enough in this country. It is not easy to grasp in the first plays, when to invest in a country and when to switch to others.

I am not a big fan of the rondell mechanism. It seams as in this game the only way to get money is to collect taxes as the leader of one country. Receiving interests is often not chosen by the leader, since other players would benefit from that. That is also a very thematic disconnect for me: The rondell suggests something like an annual rythm, but you can skip events like paying interests all the time. In my group it never turned out that being only a minor creditor is an advantage. 

Update: I have played the original Imperial now, too. I like the original a bit better, because of the tighter map.

This is quite clever. You have a civ/diplomacy style conflict board with six powers, but in which the player can buy influence in the various powers, effectively changing their power mid-game. That seems like a fairly cute concept but the real cleverness of the game is that it has a deeper level than that. In reality your victory objectives have nothing to do with world-conquest but are essentially about making money (either in the form of actual cash extracted from gullible governments, or bonds in the countries themselves, a very clever mechanism in which you supply the power with cash in return for a stake). The objective being to have the largest stake at the end of the game. This detaches the players from the actual conflict and also means that rather than being a negotiating game all the alliances/attacks are really dependent on the distribution of bonds in countries (harm countries you have little interest in, help those you do have an interest in). A very clever feature is that the element of bonds that denotes control and the element that denotes your interest (in terms of victory points) are not quite the same, so you can control a nation somebody else will get more victory points from.

There are some problems. The roundel used for determining nation actions is a fiddly additional piece of player control on something that isn't really the main focus. Also when players first sit down they play it like civ or diplomacy, it is clear it will take some regular play for its own unique flavour to come out. And that is the reason it only gets 7, until I've had a chance to play it a few more times.

17-02-2015. Rated after one play.Wow, complicated game but intruiging! 

In this game you are not 1 nation, instead you are influencing 6 nations by buying stocks/influence in them. You do this in order to extract money, control areas (sea or land) with those nations in order to help them grow and increase the value of these countries. The better these nations do, the points that are awarded for your 'stocks' in the end game increases. When you own the most stocks in one nation, you start controlling those lands. Ultimately, your as player is to ensure you get VPS, and making sure the nation's you ate invested in score strongly OR just buy many stocks of countries that score high.

The game revolves around a rondel mechanism. This mechanism allows you to take actions by moving forward in small steps unless you pay more to get to a specific location. You may move 3 steps, of the 8 or so that are available. So planning between actions is quite important, as some actions are out of reach as soon as you take one, because the action is further than 3 spaces away. 

Very interesting game but difficult and hard to grasp. I did enjoy my first play of it quite a bit though, although I think I start understanding the mechanisms around the middle. I think I won, because I controlled 3 nations at some point, allowing me to get WAY too much money and allowed me to invest in countries that I could grow while crushing competition. My nearest competitor didn't control nations but just bought stocks in 'my' nations and came CLOSE. Tempted to say I'd play again.. and try that strategy.

The time is set at 2030 when the world is congested by 6 great powers: US, Brazil, Europe, China, India and Russia. You play as a very rich group leader who buys national bonds of the six powers and control the policy there. It's an speculation game. The key to success lies in your foresight of seeing which superpower has the potential to win 25 VP. Unfortunately, due to geographical reason, Brazil is usually the obvious winner, making everyone bets on Brazil, which I don't see will happen 20 years later. Let's wait and see.

Downgraded from 8.2 to 6 after four plays.  The game has become formulaic and painfully dry for me, much like train games.  I'm glad I played it a few times, but I'm done.

RATING: 9
I'm only a beginner at Imperial, and I've played Imperial 2030 just a few times, so my comments should be taken with a pinch of salt; anyway, this is how I assess the differences: 

Swiss Bank: when I first read about it, I thought this would be an important change; however, though it's nice to have a little more control when you are countryless, this is really only a remedial tool for when the player controlling a country doesn't know what he is doing (i.e. he's more interested in making war than making money)--in our games, we barely ever had cause to use it.

Bonus from Taxation: this is a definite improvement, adding to the importance of controlling powerful countries and increasing the incentive to invest in order to control a country about to hit taxation. The regular bonus--along with the greater number of neutral areas to occupy--means that there will be more cash in circulation.

Cost for Moving around the Rondel: I do like the fact that it is harder for the leading country to speed around the rondel to victory, giving the weaker countries a bit more time to get to taxation before the game ends; I think it probably also makes it easier to predict which country will hit x5 first, as countries just behind the leader on the power chart will find it harder to "steal a march" to get to taxation earlier--I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.

Map Changes (fewer home spaces, more neutrals): I think this is more a question of taste: there's more chance for all the countries to interact (at least in theory; China is still going to have more to do with Russia than with Brasil) and manoeuvre; the greater number of neutral spaces also increases the tax brought in by the country. All the same, the European map has its own challenges, including greater assymetery between the different powers and a tighter conflict over the fewer neutrals. I think it's good to have the option to play with both maps, as both have their particularities that will shape how the game plays out. 

Should I buy Imperial 2030, considering that I already have Imperial? The collector in me says "yes", and I do think that the newer game is a tick better (mainly because of the tax bonus; the Swiss Bank and rondel changes can, of course, be easily implemented in the old game) and the components are a little nicer (I like the dinky wooden tanks and ships); the gamer says "maybe", but that it's not an urgent purchase, especially as our game group already has a copy of the newer game.

See also: "Imperial" ... Putting the setting into the future is interesting. Comparing the total package the classic ancestor pleases me more.

EDIT:
I really have to correct myself: this game is in no way inferior to "Imperial". It deserves the same rating. At my second play I tried to get rid of states in order to test the Swiss Bank. But it didn't work … maybe as my country became more and more unattractive. Don't wait too long for anything here.

EDIT:
3rd play ... Finally made it to lose all "my" empires and to try playing the Swiss Bank! I think I won because of the advantages of this period. Very nice option!

I thought I'd enjoy the game, but it seems to me that it drags quite considerably. There is a whole host of tactics there - and the game hasn't a single jot of luck - but there are so many major, game-affecting choices that it's practically impossible to make reasoned decisions until you've played the game a lot - and playing the game a lot is difficult. 

The time it takes means that people are not willing to sit and play for hours only to see their empire be taken by another player...

I guess I need to play it more but that's unlikely to happen.

I don't like the rondell mechanic, so I am a bit partial. However, with few players there's a big snowball effect, and with full number (theoretically the best), the downtime is too big. Still, if you start losing, it's very difficult to get back in contest. There are many better light euro wargames with deterministic battles, Antike from the same author being one.

Definitely more of a wargame than Imperial. Presence of many more neutral countries mean aggressive (imperialistic) expansion can pay off big. Any aggressive military strategy is still at risk of boardroom aggression, however - nothing worse than seeing the prize shares in a country you've built up going to a rival and profitting them. Intense.

RATING: 7
I may prefer this to Imperial, though it's a different game, and by no means necessarily better - much more of a wargame, which I think is owing to the greater abundance of neutral territories to invade into, making straightforward conquest startegies much more viable than in the original.

Imperial 2030 is a longer game than its predecessor. The increased cost for moving more than three spaces on the rondel discourages too much Taxation to Investor to Taxation jumps, which is good value for your gaming time. Unfortunately the Taxation jumps on the bond value track have been reduced over Imperial and this slows down the game considerably. One of the attractions of Imperial was that it could be played in two hours. Imperial 2030 seems to add about an hour to this playing time and as a result it suffers.

The big and obvious change between the two games is the new board with its wrap around feature, the control of strategic waterways and the increase in neutral areas. The increase in neutral areas is offset with a reduction in home factory areas from five to four. Clearly turtling is going to be a little harder and conflict is now more encouraged in neutral areas. Add a few not insubstantial rule tweaks (treading water, or maintaining position, is rewarded through fixed taxation bonuses and not just growth), Swiss bank power for non controllers, and you get a game with a reasonably different feel to the original.

Fixed taxation bonuses are a double edged addition. On the one hand they make the game less fiddly and easier to understand your bonus. On the other hand they can encourage a much different style of play by the controlling investor. Running a country into the ground in Imperial meant losing any sort of bonus, whereas in Imperial 2030 there are still decent bonuses to be had for maintaining position or even losing position.

I lean towards the original Imperial (with its bigger and nicer bits), if I have the choice. It's got a theme the appeals more to me, plays faster because of the higher bond score jumps on the taxation track and if you incorporate the Swiss bank rule then all it's missing is the fixed taxation bonus payments - easily incorporated if you want. However, both are excellent games that don't get to the table nearly often enough.

------------------------
Not as complicated as I'd feared and an absorbing two hours. You just have to pay attention that the money is flowing in all the right directions. An interesting role playing the investor. Although many investments tend to lose you money in the final scoring they can be justified by how you used the country's forces and position on the rondel.

You don't want to get too far out ahead in owning a country as it's good to have fellow investors with a vested interest in keeping your country steaming ahead. It can also be a good idea to hold back your cash with some smaller investments and then jump ahead at an opportune moment.

To play with or without the investor card, that is the question. I see advantages and disadvantages, but ultimately the increase in speed of play wins out with me in favour of the investor card. Only play with the advanced setup and if players are not experienced then I wouldn't advise playing with more than four.

Gamers seem to have a love/hate relationship with this one. Some players find the swinging ownership in a country and how that can ruin the best laid plans hard to come to terms with. Also, the real possibility that they won't control a country for a length of time can be boring. With players who enjoy the game it can be a wonderful experience, for others it should be avoided. I've experienced a dud game with players who haven't grasped the 18XX nature of the game. I really like it though. There's plenty of interesting choices. Lots happening on the board. The pace of the game is nice and quick.

Then again, the development of the countries is not the goal of the game, but to achieve the most earnings. A few minor changes, but everything seems to be as remembered from the original game. Perhaps the most important modification is the map, since it is bigger now, and there are a lot of new spaces to conquest.

Mac Gerdts took the historically important and outsized role that bond markets have often played in warfare and turned it into two brilliant board games (Imperial and Imperial 2030). These games teach the valuable lesson that since the advent of professional (and thus very expensive) armies the world's bankers and financiers have been as important to waging successful war than the generals and guns. My favorite Gerdts game (together with Imperial). Great games!

After playing for ten minutes, my friends and I realised this was something special. Being the investors, players are not 'doomed' to stick with any one nation and can buy nations out from other players by investing in a greater value of bonds. The mechanics are genius, for if a player wants to buy bonds, they must accumulate cash from the countries, which means the countries must accumulate cash, and to do so the countries must tax their population, also bringing the end of the game that little bit closer. I won the last 3-player game despite only being in control of Europe because I made wiser bond investments which paid off at the end. It may not sound like an entertaining game since it's all based on bonds and interest rates, but there is a lot of tension and, more importantly, there are no hard feelings if you get invaded because it's not 'your' nation per se. A truly brilliant game!

FUN ★★★✰✰
It's quite exciting to play the role of a Swiss (!) investor who rules big countries from behind the scene. What is new in this game (for me) is that you will probably manage different countries along the play, so that what you prepared with your first countries would benefit to other players. This is quite troubling the first times, but you will get used to. It's overall a very good game that my friends and I like to play. I would recommend it at 3-5 players around the table.

RULES ★★★✰✰
Rules are not so complicated but they could have been written is a clearer way, in my opinion. The forum is full of questions, and hopefully answers if you purchase this game.

IMMERSION ★★★✰✰
The game tells a story but I don't think you are going to remember it for a long time as it can be the case for historical games. Nevertheless, there is a quite a lot of fun by playing this game so that this criteria is not the most important.

DEPTH ★★★★✰
This game can be played several times without feeling some kind of boredom. It's maybe not so deep strategically, but the fun is there and I am sure people will accept easily a proposal to take it out of the shelf on a rainy sunday to spend good time with it.

RATING: 8
Extremely unintuitive game (partially due to originality and partially due to some clunkiness in its language/system), and some effort overhead is needed to get through the first few 4-5-hour games. In the meantime, it's fun to wheel and deal and maneuver countries to backstab each other and take over the world, even if you aren't familiar with the language yet.

The game itself is relentlessly situational, and you work towards, or fail, your goal incrementally -- a skipped rondel space here, a missing $2 mil. there. Whether you like the game depends on whether these tiny, nitpicky details detract from the grand scale of awesomeness that comes with the genius thematic idea of acting as a nefarious enabler of military-industrial complexes in a tense geopolitical future.

Looks like a cash-cow rip-off compared to the original Imperial for those who already own it. I'd choose this over the original though because of the pretty board and colors, solid components, cooler theme and more room for military adventure (more neutral areas, and areas are better connected between powers).

--------

So many things to keep track of in this game! Here are a few reminders for myself:

1. When on Investor, invest in countries that are ready to maneuver, tax or pay out.
2. Controlling 2 adjacent countries = keep spinning them, but watch for buyouts.
3. Getting bought out is okay if many markers are going near Investor.
4. As the Swiss Bank, jump back into the fray when you get to double-Invest and take 2 consecutive countries.
5. Cash flow and Rondel timing is extremely important with 3 players.
6. Try solidifying investments first before acquiring puppet states.

I've liked and performed better in 4-player so far. 3-player seems much less forgiving: I got caught without enough cash in Investor a lot; could never time my investments right; and it's easy to fall behind once the other two players both go strong in a couple of countries.

Imperial to gra ekonomiczna z podtekstem politycznym, w której to grze sześć głównych potęg gospodarczych naszego globu toczy nieustający konflikt zbrojny o poszerzenie swoich terytoriów ...wizja straszna i niepokojąca ...do tego zadaniem graczy jest zbicie jak największego kapitału na tychże konfliktach i wykorzystanie go do zakupu udziałów w gospodarkach tych mocarstw które uzyskują przewagę nad innymi. Posiadając pakiet większościowy akcji danego mocarstwa gracz praktycznie kieruje jego polityką (konfliktami zbrojnymi) do momentu gdy (jeśli) inny gracz wykupi więcej udziałów tego mocarstwa.

Będę szczery - w grze nie za bardzo leży mi temat - kwestia zapatrywań, ponadto nie potrafię utożsamić się z sytuacją na planszy mając świadomość że w każdym momencie mogę stracić kontrolę nad "moim" mocarstwem. Z drugiej strony trzeba przyznać, że gra ma przyjemny i łatwy w obsłudze mechanizm "rondla" i całkiem niezłą grywalność.

В отличии от других игр, особо требует определённого навыка игры. Первые партии проходят, из-за незнания игроками тактических вопросов и игровым привычкам привитым абсолютным большинством других игр, совершенно глупо.

Mindenképp marad az egy pont különbség a régi és új változat között. A Svájci bankra teljesen jó stratégia építhető. A gond pedig tényleg egyedül a hossza a játéknak, ami 4-5 órás is lehet, de akár sokkal hamarabb is véget érhet, így nehéz ezzel számolni.

One notch down with respect to Imperial as, given the limited exposure I had to the game, original Imperial is more suggestive of the historical situations. Due to the open, wrapping map, the powers here feel somehow more generic. Still a great game.

A strange game that looks like a global conquest game but is actually about influencing nations to act to benefit your pocket book.
It's easy to keep up but hard to actually compete with the leaders.  It is possible to have no real "turn" but still do well, if you keep buying the lower valued investments.

Played as a prototype. My favorite game. Nothing more needed to say.

First and only play so far and what I expected was confirmed. This is a top game, a gamers terrific experience. Although 2030 is based on old Imperial with only but a few minor changes, it turns out to be a significantly different game. Both the map and the scoring mechanism are different enough to absorb players into a different game play despite its resemblances to original Imperial. This version is much more confrontational, controlling nations it's not as secure as in original Imperial. Tweaks and power changes are constant. Still best game ever made along with old/original Imperial.

Really amazing concept!
The plays that can be setup because of the change of control in a certain countries are the best thing, and are more rewarding than any other "shares" game i've played
For instance, when you take control of a country from a player, and use it to attack the other interests of that player, it's pretty devastating :D

I have become a fan of the Rondel games by Mac Gerdts.  I few friends already had Imperial or Antike, so when it came to scratching that itch I picked up Imperial 2030 and I have been impressed.  2030 ‘fixes’ some of the biggest issues with Imperial.  Primarily the endgame situation where players would manipulate the rondel form invest to taxation to invest.  In 2030, the extra movement around the Rondel now costs more to the player and that cost increase as the power of the country increases.  In any case, this has now become my want to play game when we have 6 players.

I like this game because it is like the spirit of an 18XX game that plays in a fraction of the time, but I have issues with the way it plays.  Specifically, the game seems to advantage the person who is the quickest to divest himself of controlling any of the countries.  Playing a game where the only thing you do is buy bonds every now and then to try to avoid gaining control of a country but still remain competitive seems fairly boring to me.  Despite this, it is still possible for a person controlling a country to win, which makes the game far more fun to play.

Like Imperial, but on a larger scale, and in a futuristic fantasyland where the EU constitutes a military power. It took a few turns to get used to the different board layout & topology, but rules changes all seemed good - I especially like the variable cost to extra rondel spaces. We missed the one about Swiss Bank holders being able to oblige a country to choose Investor.

RATING: 7
Reimplementation of Mac Gerdts' rondel-driven stock/area majority game 'Imperial'. Like its predecessor, the object is to purchase bonds in particular countries in the hope that they will be of the greatest value by the end of the game. In terms of rules, this is identical to 'Imperial' but it plays differently due to the greater number of neutral areas on the map, which can lead to a far quicker growth of taxation bonuses. Because of this the game can feel less tight and that results in players clamouring for bonds in the nations' runaway leader, and that can be a lottery somewhat due to requiring possession of the investor card. This is by no means a bad game and there is plenty here of interest, although 'Imperial' is slightly the superior effort.

RATING: N/A
A fantastic, very interactive game! The rules are not difficult to comprehend, but the game is full of hard decisions. There are three game layers: (a) actions of the six nations, (b) the ownership of nation bonds and (c) the position of the investor card (if you play with the basic variant) which let you invest in nations. If you plan to win the game, you need to control all the layers and sometimes sacrifice your success on one of the layers for a good move in another. Very good for four or five players, interesting for three guys, too. Moreover, the game is relatively not very long, about 3 hours, independently of number of players.

First game had a number of rules mistakes and missed opportunities so I expect a second play to make more sense. Still I'm not sure what I think of it. The stock aspects are interesting when combined with the military conquests but does the DoaM aspect add enough interesting choices for the additional time and complexity? Is there enough here to make it stand out from all the other economic/stock games? 

The timing aspects with the rondel play are great but the flexibility therein make it very hard to make a strategic play as any unexpected tactical decision by another player can ruin even the best laid plans.

Mechanics are easy to understand, but path to victory is difficult to find. Game has a lot of variety depending on user actions. It's a game where you never get bored and down time is really small. There are things to think of even when it's not you moving.

Another aspect I love is that it doesn't work in "player turns" but rather "nation turns" so a player can have multiple turns one after another or she can have no turns at all for a long time.

Best with 4 players, maybe 5. In 6 players things happen slowly and most of the game a player will rule no country (and have no turns) so she just gets bored hoping for the game to end soon.

In 2 (and sometimes 3 players) game is very balanced in a boring way. Only small fights here an there, everybody invests in their own countries. Not much action.

A truly great game. The share-dealing mechanics raise it head and shoulders above other games of its type, and require a certain attitude in order to play successfully. If it has any flaws, it's perhaps that the beginning (and to some extent the ending) can have some rather obvious no-brainer moves. That's more than made up for by the utterly chaotic and cut-throat mid-game, however.

Yes, this is Imperial 2.0, but somehow the thoughtful rules tweaks and the breathtaking new map transform Imperial from a quirky stock market game into a grand battle for the globe.  Very simple battle mechanics make Imperial 2030 the war game for people who don't like war games.

Rating after one play, may increase with more experience. It takes quite a few rounds to understand how you can influence your winning chances. The last few investments can be very strong, so I wonder how much winning the game depends on whether you can buy the desired "stock". We played with the investment marker, so you could not always invest and at least one player complained that he could not get what he knew would in him the game.
The combination of investment/ stock exchange game with a conflict/ war game is unusual.

First Impression:
Nice idea, poor execution.

1) From the ~60 rounds to be played, players will have money enough to invest about 6-10 times. And since that's all the game is trully about you spend 84%-90% of your time playing a mindless risk game you couldn't care less.

2) Players earn money mainly by investor and taxation actions (2/8 available), but even though the investor gives to all investors, the taxation gives only to the biggest one! Thus, the players in control of the big powers will get MUCH more money which in turn will allow them to invest more thus creating a snowball runaway leader effect. And you can't really do anything about it, even if you beat their puppets they'll have enough money by then to invest in the new superpower..

3) Starting players may randomly end up controlling more powers than their opponents at start up. Needless to say that gives them an insane advantage..

My favorite Eurogame. Playtime roughly 2.5 hours with 4 people.
Recommended players : 3 to 5 players. 6 also perfectly possible but the chance of one player being "countryless" for longer periods of time can make it a bit boring for that player. (it doesn't significantly reduce his chances to win though)

My kind of game.  One play but this is my sweet spot.  Rating could be a 10 with more plays and I will have more descriptive comments with more plays.  I like the bigger map, it gives more choices opportunities  and promotes different styles.  Anyways, playing the system learning how other payers play (especially when they control a certain nation), a mix between aggression and doing your own thing, plus the game is opaque and you need to go back and examine the game to see why someone won.  It generates strategy talk after the game and sits on my brain as well.

I prefer this to the original.  The more open spaces, and the wrapping map makes this a plus and makes the games unfold in a different fashion.

RATING: 9
Absolutely fantastic! I can unreservedly say after my first 3 plays that Mac Gerdts has created a very worthy follow-up to his 2006 Game of the Year (as per my personal selections). It's a risky proposition attempting to design a successor to a game as well-received as Imperial, given the high standard to which its bound to be held, but Imperial 2030 not only meets that lofty bar, but possibly exceeds its parent. As a disclaimer, if you were not a fan of Imperial, then it's unlikely that Imperial 2030 addresses your qualms. However, if you did enjoy Imperial or admired it with some reservations even, then Imperial 2030 is well worth checking out. You should watch this video demo by Gerdts at Essen to get an explanation straight from the horse's mouth. I'll summarize the high points for you here. First, Imperial 2030 is a new map, and who doesn't love new maps? They're such a great way to get a new experience without having to learn a whole new set of rules (see, e.g., Age of Steam). In particular, the new map reduces the size of home nations so as to include more neutral territories and more water, giving you more territory to fight over and making naval convoys more significant. Second (and perhaps most importantly), Imperial 2030 revises the rules for advancing extra spaces around the Rondel so that it no longer costs a flat 2 million per space, but rather costs 1 plus the nation's power multiplier. This provides for a scaling cost that is lower at the beginning of the game (making it more feasible to do so early on) and higher at the end of the game for the high scoring nations (making it more expensive to skip from Taxation to Investor and back to Taxation in two turns). Those are the principal advantages, but you've also got the introduction of the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, along with a new 30 million bond that allows country control to shift later in the game. There's truly a plethora of things in Imperial 2030 that make it potentially even superior to its progenitor, and hopefully I'll have the chance to play both many more times.

There is much to like about this game.  The rondel, the countries-as-stock, the first half is great... but after a certain point the game becomes a calculation.  From about a little past halfway through till the end there are no decisions.  There is a best move and nothing else worth doing.  You could feed the data into a machine and declare the winner.

RATING: 7.5
[b]Basic rules overview[/b]
The basic actions (that happen in a rondel - much like almost all the Mac Gerdts games) are: [b]Production[/b] (each factory and port produces 1 unit); [b]Factory[/b] (build, at the cost of 5 million, one factory or port); [b]Maneuver[/b] (may move all units to and adjacent land area or sea; if there are units of other nations in the place, the player decide if will happen a battle or not - then, if the choice is to enter in peace, the player with the units originally there chooses; the units/ships are destroyed in a 1:1 basis); [b]Import[/b] (hire units or ships, up to 3, paying 1 million for each); [b]Investor[/b] (bonds of the nation activating this action pay interest); [b]Taxation[/b] (add +2 per each factory and port, +1 for each area under the control of the nation, take -1 per each unit and ship, the product of this will be the tax level, and you compare it in table in the board, to see how much will be the increase of the nation power and the bonus, both of which can be nill).

It is allowed to the player move the nation marker under his control up to 3 spaces in the rondel at no cost, and, above this, he must spend (from his own money) 1 million + the power modifier of the nation for each space above the three spaces. Everytime the marker, no matter of which nation, passes by or stop in the Investor space, the player with the investidor marker gains 2 million and my purchase a new bond or upgrade one that he already have.

The game ends as soon as the power marker of one nation reaches the spot 25 (x5) of the power track. Then, all the bonds of the nations will pay accordingly to the value of Interest on them times de modifier of the nation on the power track. This will add up with what the players already saved during the game. The winner will the player with the most money.

[b]Differences from [thing=24181][/thing][/b]
I played [thing=24181][/thing] twice, but this version never before. The main differences are: the Taxation of the countries is worth less for the controller (in the money gain when it happens); there is way less conflict within the borders of the main nations, since there are way more neutral areas in the board (Africa, Oceania, the Americas and Middle-East), going from 15 in [thing=24181][/thing] to 27 in [thing=54138][/thing]; the map, now, has the whole world, so Russia isn't all protected in the east, and also the nations aren't all close together (well, at least USA, Europe and Brazil), so there is way less threat to the factories and ports of the nations, and combats between armies and fleets aren't usual in the early game, as the expansion can happen in the neutral areas without problems; the power track in [thing=54138][/thing] is tougher, since the game considers the greater number of neutral areas (but, in my play, more neutral areas required more armies to take and hold them, so, in the end, the game lasted way more than in my plays of [thing=24181][/thing], since Taxation didn't go all the way up as the game expected us to do, but this could be because the way we played), for example: in [thing=24181][/thing] a +10 difference was good for +5 of power increase, but in [thing=54138][/thing], the same would net the nation only +3.

[b]Comments[/b]
[thing=54138][/thing] is a strategy game, with no luck involved: battles are deterministic, movements always lead to adjacent regions, the formula for the Taxation and Investor activation never changes, the number of units and/or ships built in the Production activation is known, there aren't event cards, no dice rolls. Is important to know, though, that the rules themselves aren't hard to grasp: you basically only have that 6 actions to do (and, in most turns, you will have three options to choose, since, only rarely, more in the end of the game, will someone pay to advance the marker more than three spaces), and bonds to buy.

It also has a good deal of interaction, being a, somewhat, semi-cooperative game, since more than one player will want one nation to do well, because of the bonds he has of it, but not too well if he isn't the controller of the nation (because the controller will gain more, even if not all that much more). One player can't really prevent other from buying bonds and even taking control of a nation you hold (but you can try, buy activating the Investor when the person with the investor marker doesn't have much money). The game do allow negotiation (but not the exchange of money) and this can be key in order to rise the power of a nation that two or more players have and that isn't really paying off so far. It is also possible for someone to really put a break on the advance of a nation - for example, I, holding China, always sent my units to occupy the a factory and a port of Russia (I don't had any bonds from Russia), and, because of this, other player (with over 13 bonds of Russia) needed to get out of its way to take the control of China from me, in order to advance Russia (and I got what I wanted: the Swiss bank).

The game requires the player to take chances, to try to see ahead of others which bonds will be worth more and which won't - this is important, since the number of bonds is very limited (only 9, of different values, for each nation), so, once they are all gone, they won't return to the market, so if you waited to see, well...

I also believe that most games of [thing=54138][/thing] will be decided only in the very end, not only because a nation can have some big pushes that may change things a lot, but also because the players will likely have bonds across the nations, and with timming to take control of nations or when to let them go (the use of the Swiss Bank can be a really powerful move if used well), even if a player has bonds not worth much, he can still recover.

All in all, [thing=54138][/thing] is a good game, one that I liked a little less than its older brother (due to this one be a quicker game, still keeping all the interesting parts), but it is as much solid and fun. Really recommended for those that enjoy some brain-burn euro with a high amount of interaction.

I find the rondel action selection mechanism a constraining tick-tock thing that drives me nuts. The abstraction of it is a clever idea but just doesn't translate, especially with the investment layer - already an abstraction you just track in your mind & not on the board - hogging bandwidth. To interrupt that meaningful thing with this abstracted selection process just doesn't fit my mind's notion of right overhead. I do appreciate why people love it tho.

I do get the riff on Risk-like conquering, and the value of playing off those expectations with the investment game it really is. The problem is once that pleasant surprise flips your brain, the next plays become tiresome, overburdened, and in our game-churn environment a long taxing process to show someone 'this isn't Risk, cool, huh?" 

For a 'shared incentive' game, I find the lower overhead of Winsome titles (for example) and many other wonders (such as Neue Heimat) more appealing than the 'dudes on a map' riff and the tick-tock rondel.

Posséder. Ce jeu permet de comprendre le système monétaire international. Avec un peu d'abstractions, on saisi mieux les mécanisme caché derrière les guerres, la diplomatie et les raisons d'état.

The more I play games the more I find that I enjoy games where player interaction is a major factor to decisions.  Imperial 2030 is one that capitalizes on this.  Watching how players are thinking and behaving are a key part of coming out on top.

Very similar to its ancestor, [gameid=24181].  Not different enough to justify owning both.  The basic gameplay of economic ascendancy is as good as it was in the previous edition.  There are subtle changes to this edition, that, while making the game easier to teach and the flow easier to observe, tend to sanitize the game as well, and not make it as much about timing the market.  Some of the changes are for the better, but my overall opinion is that it's just a touch less interesting than its forbear.  The linear track for country turn and the easier to understand bonus chart make the game flow smoother, but I don't really like the much larger number of neutrals, or the change to how the bonuses are paid out.  As for the Swiss Bank rule, it STILL needs some tweaking, as now it is too powerful to be left without a country, as you can hoover up all the stocks with good investment potential.  There's a greater impetus to keep a country in power, rather than grow the smaller nations, which can make the smaller nations more irrelevant.  Finally, the theme makes much less sense to me.  Unless something drastic happens in the next 20 years, I don't see world politics turning into a second race for colonization.

Very similar to the original - primarily a new wrap-around world map, which is probably slightly better than the original.

Normally, I would enter a caveat stating that I had only played this with 2 players, but since I've played Imperial before, I can see enough of the differences to be able to compare the two.  I think that people who like the first one will like this one well enough, though this version of the game seems to loosen up the game a bit.  Primarily, there are a lot more neutral territories, leading to greater taxation, which in turn leads to a faster endgame.  Otherwise, the game is very much like the original, and the narrative and flow of the game is almost identical to the first game.  Both games are OK for me, just nothing particularly special.  I will say that playing the game with just two players, since you can turtle your best country with the other two countries.  I can see it better with at least 4 players.  For me, this game gets the same rating as the original.

Clever re-implementation of the original "Imperial", with some new rules and a new map which improve a bit the overall feeling of the game. Anyway, not enough differences to really raise the rating.

When playing this game I feel nasty and powerful, the theme and gameplay feel melded together. I actively seek to play this game even tho the playtime is long, this is the most underrated game in my collection.

RATING: 8
Imperial redone to reflect a near future world.  The broadened geopolitical arena provides more contested areas.  The additional contested areas along with subtle rules tweaks here and there change the game enough where this game isn't just a reskin of the original.  I don't really have much of a preference of one or the other.  Both are good fun in their own imperialism.

A solid economics game with a war element. Players invest in nations and build up those nations so they're generating a lot of income for them. I like the investing element of the game.

RATING: 8
If you don't have Imperial, get this game.  If you have Imperial, you're probably a candidate for the upgrade version if you can find it.  Again, this is not a war game for those considering it.  It's all about finance and political control.

Very solid game, complex but not complicated. Even if u don't know Imperial, after a few rounds playing is very easy. I am not sure 2 hours are enough.
I can't see any major defect:even the player without nations for a long time have chances to win.

Strategic investment game of world superpowers using a rondel to tax, build military from factories, wage war in a diceless, chanceless Risk conquest coupled with chanceless Acquire-like growth of invested powers.  Nearly pure test of brain against brain.

A mix of Chicago Express and Diplomacy, with the feel of Puerto Rico. Disguised as a wargame, this was a really good economic game. Easy to teach, and great player interaction. Looking forward to play it again.

Super fun political / war domination game.  Lots of options, rise and fall of nations, and good stuff.  Great use of the 'rondel' to select what actions you want to take.

Interesting game but looking into Imperial.

First play w 4p. I thought it was great though it requires immediate and unflinching attention from all involved. One player's inattention allowed another to snowball and run away with the game.

This is the kind of game i love. An open playing field and anything is possible, many strategies and a minimum of limiting rules. 

Very streamlined! Handbook and summary cards are very well done.

It's just kick ass to let someone do all the work for you and then just take over "his" nation. Or to use one nation just as a puppet for your main nation. It's an excellent game and quite realistic too! 

The world is in your hands ...

I own the upgrade kit for basic Imperial rather than the whole of Imperial 2030. (So no little tanks and modern ships - you have to re use the military units from the first game). I will always play this but prefer the more closed in and tighter parent game. There are more neutral territories to conquer here and while the increasing cost for players to push a nation's marker around the roundel between Investor and Taxation seemed like a good idea in theory - it seems to drag the game out longer and evens out the ending values of national shares. In the original game - if a player rushes a nation to the finish by paying to push the roundel, the other players are to blame for not seeing it coming and stopping it sooner.

I prefer the original game.  It has more of a knife-fighting map, as there is little room to expand before you are left with armies dawdling in your enemies yard.

There is a lack of randomness to ensure replayability in the long term. Timing of investments are paramount as the world situation is constantly changing. Most of the actions take little time to complete, so downtime is not too long. An enjoyable game.

it was interesting on first play, but I didn't get it... looks like "dudes-on-a-map", but plays like a stock holding game... I'm fuzzy on what I played here and I'll have to play again to clarify if I like this or not...

RATING: 10
+: quite easy to learn the rules (not to master the game!)
+: solid gamers-only strategy game from Essen '09
+: unique ( except that it's very much like Imperial ;-) )
+: area movement simply appeals to me 
+: no randomness (except for player order)
+: several officially promoted free (!) variants
+: predict the choices of other players
+: very flexible number of players
-?: winning potential can depend a bit on player chaos. Player movement on rondel affects when you can buy, and how rich you are at that time. (tentative)
-: poses a steep learning curve: winning condition can appear counterintuitive during first plays (money, not domination)
-: when others have AP :-(
-: takes longer than standard imperial

I just love the underlying political incorrectness. This game depicts the Mother of All Political Corruption! The rules are simple to learn but the game is difficult to win. Print quality is excellent and the art is colorful, clear and easy to read. The simple game mechanics provide surprisingly deep strategic options. There is no randomness and every moment in the game is exciting, fun and tense. What's not to love?

Epic feeling game that marries very light war game with much more meaty economics. It is really about the economics, the war serves the purpose of helping you make more money off countries. Really tense, lots of deep choices.

Great addition with completely different map (straits are fabulously diplomatic) and new taxation option. I treat this one more as an expansion - with slight changes in balance a new situation is given, the one that is ultimately much less cutthroat.

Интересная и актуальная политическая/экономическая стратегия. Мы выступаем за инвесторов в страны, управляя их военной машиной, но цель - не поглотить весь мир, а выкачать как можно больше денег из страны, либо развив её, либо разорив. Играется отлично как вдвоём, так и вшестером. Правила самой игры лёгкие, но трудно привыкнуть к тому, что "твоих" стран нет, есть лишь акции, и твоя цель - личное обогащение, а не развитие подопечных. 

Минусы - более 2 часов, сложное вхождение новичков из-за упомянутой особенности. Нужно много считать, чтобы приблизится к победе. Зачастую приходится играть как будто за нескольких игроков (стран), и контролировать даже чужую наличность.

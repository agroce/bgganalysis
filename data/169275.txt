Clearly an unknown gem. The whole pixel tactics series deserves more attention, love and especially: more time on the table! 
It's one of those games that's quite simple to learn but has tough choices affecting your gameplay enormously.
The only downside i'd give it is that some things aren't always clear (ie: There's no clarification about the token symbols; i've got PT4, 5 and DX so there's quite a few tokens and i only recognize the virus token and clock token)
Regardless of that; a simple "hey you wanna.." would suffice because; yes i would very much like to play Pixel Tactics...any version.

More characters, which are the meat and potatoes of this system, plus the new Trap mechanic which is good for setting up a lot of counters against your opponent, and vice versa. Pixel Tactics remains an elegant system with a cute art theme representing a lot of my childhood, and the sheer amount of replayability expands with each of these new numbered sets. Bring on 5!

There is a LOT to be determined through multiple playthroughs as the icons and manual leave a great deal unexplained.  But once you DO decipher it, hoo-boy - you are in for one of the absolute MOST strategic card games I've played in a while.  The sheer number of options on each card mixed with the flexibility of your actions AND the special effects of each hero guarantees no playthrough will ever be the same.   TWICE my opponent and I survived each others' entire deck once we got the idea of all the ENORMOUS amount of information for an epic hour long duel.

Great little card game.  Amazing play for such a small thing.  Rated 7 across the board.  Every expansion is just more of the same.  You don't like one, you don't like 'em all.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (January 2017)

I really enjoy the whole Pixel Tactics series of games, I have them all but taking them to the table has proven a challenge. Two players games are difficult to play in my current game environment. We are, more often than not, more than 2 players, but I had the opportunity to play Pixel Tactics 4 while we waited for some friends to arrive, and I really enjoyed it. 

I have only played once so I barely scratched the deepness of the game.

Pixel Tactics is, in general, an easy to learn (around 7 minutes) hard to master game. It offers a plethora of choices with only 25 cards. Each card can be used in 5 different ways so the permutations and combos possible are very high (very high replayability) and that increases exponentially if you mix the cards from all the games, a very positive thing in my book. 

Playtime is around 45 minutes.

The game offers interesting decisions in a, relatively, short time frame. Every iteration of the game adds something new to the game and in Pixel Tactics 4´s case, it adds traps. I previously played with traps with the Deluxe Edition, but it was this game the one that introduced them. They are very fun to play because they allow you to bluff a little and you can also surprise your opponent. 

Within my limited perspective, it seems some of the leaders of this game are very powerful, my opponent had one that hurt my leader every time I played a new hero, that’s insane!

Bottom line, Pixel Tactics 4 is a good two game and a keeper in my game collection. I wish I could explore the game further and my desire to play it again is high.

New set of Pixel Tactics stuff.  This game thrives on new options and Level 99 really has done a great job of coming up with new and creative abilities for their heroes in each set.

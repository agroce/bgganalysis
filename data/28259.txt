Based on one play.  It seemed like a bit too much of a random 'take that' fest to me.

I think I'd have enjoyed it more with mates and a lot of beer.

RATING: 5
Fun backstabby game. It's an enjoyable game, but like Munchkin (which it reminds me of), pretty random. I have no real complaints about the game itself, besides feeling that it's too long for the sort of light, silly game that it is. Given that the game has player elimination, the length is a greater issue, as a player can conceivably be out for half the game. That said, it's a fun game and I'd certainly be willing to play it if I am in the mood for a relaxed, light gaming experience.

Not a bad game with the right group of people - quite light and fun.  I would prefer this sort of game to be faster than the listed 90 mins.  The cards are very light and will wear out quickly with more plays!

Sold, I have better adventure games :)

RATING: 5
I can understand those who might enjoy this one, but there are several problems. The puzzle room is simply a pain to resolve - not fun at all. It's a memory game for goodness sake! The game balance is only the result of luck as is much of the game. The back stabbing is likely either too fierce or reserved purely for the final encounter. All in all, depends on the crowd as this is a game of style over substance. In general, you can count me out.

Well, we tried it once, and it fell horribly flat.  There's a lot of potential here so we'll keep trying it.  I like the production values and there's alot to like about the way the rulebook was done.  So we're very willing to give this game a chance to prove itself.

Almost two years later and we've tried it a couple more times:  It really isn't bad, but I still don't see it earning very much table time.  I'm more inclined to try the expansions, which may make for a more complete game.

Cutthroat Caverns is good, light fun. Tuns a little too long with higher player counts. It's basically the game Munchkin should have been. Starts to feel a little samey after a number of plays (despite the giant stack of monsters). It probably needs the expansions that add asymmetric character powers and more stuff to give it longevity.

Would rather play Cosmic Encounter, removed from Collection.

RATING: 6
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

The idea of the game is neat and, although the mechanisms involve a medium amount of luck, I enjoyed the game overall. Just I really think the game should be shorter. 10 rounds is too much, since it's basically the same thing over and over again. If this game lasted from 30 to 40 minutes, I would probably rate it much higher and maybe I would even consider the idea of owning it.

Fairly enjoyable game. Nicely themed (though I would like more differences between the characters). But: I don't particularly like take-that games, the game feels quite random and the production values are a little below what I'd expect (it just feels a bit flimsy).

RATING: 5
Good party game that is great with more gamers. The last card going in wins the VP is slightly annoying but the way that happens are entertaining with the right group of gamers.

Other than that, it's just a number game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Excellent concept ruined by chaotic gameplay. The range of damage done by a player in a single turn can range from zero to beyond two hundred. That's too wide of a spread! There are also too many cards that cancel a players action! If Steve Jackson Games' Munchkin took itself seriously, it would be this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Judging from my one experience, it is a totally average game. Perhaps the expansions may ratchet up the balance between cooperation and screwing your neighbor, but as is, it is a lot easier to help than to hinder your opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
another card based game (they're easy to carry around) where you and your friends have discovered the artifact of untold power.

Thing is, there's no concept of sharing here.

Cue a trip out of the dungeon fighting monsters along the way and trying to get the most prestige from defeating them. The USP here is that you are all fighting the same monster (all of which have different attacks and different characteristics) - but only the character who lands the final, killing blow, gains the points. 

This means a lot of backstabbing, blocking your allies attacks, potion stealing and general mayhem - thing is though, if you let your buddies die too quickly, the monsters stay as strong as they were, so you may be in deep trouble and die without escaping with your loot.

In this instance there is no winner.

RATING: 8
This is a hack'n slash, 'take that', dungeon adventure game. The concept is simple; kill monsters and take your reward. It's been done a million times before, right?. I'm sure you're all rolling your eyes and about ready to move on. Well hold on there a minute, I've played many of those games but none have been quite as enjoyable as this one. What does this one have going for it when so many others have failed? A) It's simple.  Essentially a deck of cards and some counters. You can teach this game to a group of newbies in no more than 10 minutes. B) It plays quickly C) It has just the right card mix and number of cards in hand to give players some control (yes, even in a 'take that' card game). D) It balances the need to cooperate to kill the monsters with the desire to grab the prestige for yourself very nicely. Sure there is backstabbing but many of the monsters are nasty enough that if you are focusing on doing the other players in and not killing the monsters then you're all dead. Many of the monster abilities are obvious enough that the players know right from the start that some cooperation is needed. E) The fiddly factor is pretty low. You don't have to juggle tons of counters and cards and player boards to keep track of this and that. 

If you don't like fantasy type games then this one is not for you. If you don't care for some randomness in your games (it is a card game) then you won't like it. If you're not into direct player-player screwage then move along. But overall, I'd say this is a very nicely balanced game that is a lot of fun. I picked it up on a whim and am very happy to have it.

A nice little semi-cooperative "stab-a-friend" game that plays pretty quickly with very little downtime.  All players place cards face down in an attempt to damage and ultimately kill an enemy.  The cutthroat part comes in to the mechanic that players only receive victory points if they land the killing blow on the creature.  This leads to a decent amount of analysis on which card you should play based on your turn order and the number of hitpoints left on the creature; however, there are also reaction cards that allow you to cancel an opponents carefully thought out plan. It is a lot of fun with the right group, and is exciting from beginning to end.

Disclaimer: The only problem this game suffers from is player elimination.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Wanted to like it, but just failed with my group. Design is a bit awkwardly old (the rules are fairly confusing), the aesthetics are lacking, the game is incredibly random, and the main tension of trying to last-hit just doesn't work well.

Really, really needed unique character decks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I quite like Cutthroat Caverns.  I enjoy games in which there's a tension between cooperative and selfish play.  In this one you need to cooperate to kill the nastier monsters, but you want to be the player who collects the prestige for delivering the coup de grace.  You want your opponents' characters dead, but you need them alive to soak up hits.  

There are quite a lot of take that cards in the deck, which are both amusing and can become a bit of a problem.  With five players, there are so many of these cards in players' hands that the game becomes highly chaotic, encounters drag on as the players cancel each other out, and the game outstays its welcome.  The two games I've played with three have not suffered from this.

Production quality is pretty good, though I would have liked thicker character cards.  The artwork is also pretty good.

I had bought way too much for this game over the years waiting for a good opportunity to play it. I finally got the chance on holiday at a friends house. Everything about this game said it would be one of my favorites ever, but I was terribly wrong. In the end, the core mechanic feels book keepy to me, and that is before you add in the special monster mechanics which in turn make it feel fiddly. I am horribly disappointed with this game. I can see how some people could enjoy it, but it is just too different from the game I was looking for it to be.

RATING: 9
A fresh take on "cooperative" game play - one which relies on ultimately screwing your allies to win! :-D This game manages to make hosing your fellows both light-hearted and fun - either as the hoser or the hosee. The dungeoneering theme and the extremely quick play time are just added icing on the cake.

RATING: 6
This is a card driven, competitive coop game where each player wants to contribute to the defeat of a monster, but particularly wants to be the one to play the card that finally defeats it, at which point only that player gets the victory points.  

Numerical values on the cards contribute to the defeat of the monsters, while many special effects cards alter play.  This is a card effects game with whimsical chaos being the fun I suppose.  This gets old quickly for me.  It is just not my style of game.

Fun, but unfortunately a bit like munchkin - it's quite random (depends on who gets the screw-you cards at the right times), encourages gang-up on the leader, and lasts about twice as long as it should for how light the game is.

I've only played it one time, but I wasn't a huge fan.  The first couple of events you go against go nice and quick, with plenty of backstabbing going around.  But the later ones just take forever.

If this game didn't have player elimination, it would definitely be higher on the list. Many players do not pay mind to the consequences of losing a player early game, and so sometimes this game can end early. Still, the best part of the game is the varied and often hilarious enemies you fight.

Nice cards, but very tactical.  I thought that there would be more of a dungeon crawl aspect to it, but there's only the monster fighting mechanic.

If you like plotting the downfall of your friends, and screwing them over just when they thought they had it - this game is great.

First play was a little underwhelming.  I was hoping there would be more conflict between my need to work together and my desire to actually win.  I don't think there was ever a time when I felt that I shouldn't screw people over to get ahead.  In that sense...it really came down to who had the cards versus taking advantage of people who felt the need to be team players.

Also there are some confusing rules here that need re-working.  

Some good ideas though.  I expect what's good about this game will be exploited later in a better design.

One of the recent crop of games that provides an RPG combat feel without all the long-winded role playing.

Now this is what I think D&D is! No, really. (I'm not a big D&D fan). But if a D&D dungeon crawl were turned into a board game this would be it. The mechanic of needing everyone to cooperate but all scrabble for glory at the end is good. The variety of monsters is good and I love that they have adjusted for the number of players to keep it challenging at any level. I would say it is a bit too easy once you have played it a couple of times.

The card stock is top quality and the artwork is first rate.  However, I found this game stupidly random.

I abruptly stopped playing when told that we had at least 45 minutes left to play.

2 plays.  First was a two player game with a fellow D&Dphile.  This was a middling to interesting game.  Second game with a large group of non-gamers and gamer blend and fell pretty flat.  Non-gamers were not engaged enough to care when it was their turn, and just plain couldn't follow the rules as they were explained over and over, the gamers had less fun because the game was being pulled down.  Perhaps my grade is a little harsh because of the climate in which I played, but I was hoping for more.  Need to revise rating after another play or two with gamer gamers.

An interesting blend of competition with cooperation.  It works great with players who can laugh and trash-talk with one another.  Some of the rules seem to need some clarification, but the overall gameplay is quite fun.  It works really well with the youth.  Also the game can be quicker with fewer players.  Some may not like the repetition of turns, and the craziness of the action cards, but I find it wacky and fun.

This card game managed to make tabletop RPG accessible to casual gamers by creating a simplified system akin to a beer-and-pretzels game.  By focusing on some of the most exciting aspects of RPGs (unique creature encounters and looting treasures), simplifying them while still retaining tactical elements, and introducing various "mini-games" that feels fresh everytime, Cutthroat Caverns successfully traversed the gap between complete geekiness to casual coolness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
[after 1 play] The game wasn't all that hard to beat (as in not have all players lose) and I think there's a small problem with the card-drawing mechanism (you can end up without many cards in your hand if you draw a lot of potions), but otherwise it's a pretty fun game.

This is a "take that" game... a genre that I really dislike.  Extremely chaotic, lots of guessing and hoping for the best.  People that like the Munchkin game will probably like Cutthroat Caverns.  For me, it is 60-90 minutes of torture.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Far too random, too many cards to turn away whatever cards you have played so there's not a lot of room for skill, stategy or judgement. 

Now, I don't mind short or plain silly and random games (like Slide 5, or Bloody Legacy) but this one tried to have more than just a "take that" element to it and that was a complication too far for me. It's stuck somewhere on it's own between "fun filler" and "short serious game" and doesn't really make it to either category.

I could not get to grips with this at all really. It's also random as to who gets the potions. One of the players in the game I played had almost all and we all had none.

Thought it would be much better than it played :( Of course it depends on the group, but there were extensive rule discussions about card effects and timing, all of which made the game drag much longer than it should.

An interesting concept for a game which causes strategy to constantly shift.

The bonus vp's on the last few encounters are huge bonuses and the bulk of one's 'take-that' strategy should be saved for these encounters.

The way that some of the cards are worded leave you guessing at how to resolve things but all in all, CC was fairly intuitive and pretty fun.

One play. Wanted to cut my own throat to get this over with. OK, so it wasn't that bad. I thought the rock/paper/scissors thing was campy. It is simply difficult to get a kill, especially when you are sixth in line for a shot.

RATING: 5
Filler - but an uninteresting one. Doesn't really get neither the dungeon exploring feeling out or the backstabbing for that matter. The 4 expanions already seems also to point a bit in the direction that this is one of those "must keep buying expansions to keep it interesting" because the basic game can only survive a play or two.. Some of the glass beads are ok though, but that's more or less it.

I love the nastiness of this game. The tag-line, "Without teamwork, you'll never survive; without betrayal, you'll never win", is a perfect description of how the game plays. It would score an [8] if there were more ways to punish other players without actually removing them from the game. And a [9] if it were slightly quicker.

I think my issues with this game really stem from it not being the right game for my group. The game always plays fairly boring and I've never understood how people die. I've never had a player die even if everyone gangs up on them. Also, this game really needs the Deeper & Darker expansion at least. It still comes out from time to time, and I'll adjust ranking if things change.

RATING: 3
Too long playing time relative to the depth of gameplay and presentation. It's quite a chore of a game actually. I don't see the tension or the reward in the game. I mean yeah, semi-coop mechanic have the potential to create intriguing situations for players but in this game the lack of development is just agonizing. You're playing cards for over an hour solely focused on ruining everybody else's plans just so you might come out the other end with the least bad performance

I do applaud the creative design of the bosses though. They alone bring most of the intrigue present in the game, but alas it's not enough.

What to play instead:
Battlestar Gallactica: a game with actual tension and much more subversive semi-coop elements.
Illuminati: A bit similar to Munchkin in its lack of limitation but at least this  game has a humorous/absurd quality to it.

RATING: 6
I've been enjoying this game, but have to admit that I've been underwhelmed by the difficulty. I was expecting to see players regularly killed, a lack of teamwork punished by group failure, a slog to the end, etc. ... but no, in the couple games we've played (which included the tougher monsters from the expansion) we've never seen a character seriously threatened with death. Everyone has always comfortably survived, and that seems to somewhat undermine the excitement of the game. Not sure if it's just that 4 (the number we've played with) is a less-troublesome number, or if the game is too easy ... we've been reasonably cutthroat. Anyway, the game seems pretty cool in theory, but unless I see some players getting killed sometime soon, I'll probably lose enthusiasm.

Also, to be fair, Cutthroat Caverns is probably a touch long for what it is.

First game was kind of dissappointing.  Here you have a great game, with fun mechanics, and a greta premise.  Cards galore, monsters, and get backstabbing fun, but you also have a rulebook which is incredibly lacking.  There is no talk about what order certain cards can be played and if certain cards and items overrule each other.  Dissappointing and is going to be hard to bring to the table again until I find a full list of errata.  It's a shame as this game should be an 8 and I have to rank it a 6.5 and could take it down further if I can;t get any clarifications that I need.

This is an okay fantasy game in the tradition of Munchkin.  I like it a little more than Munchkin, though, as there is a conclusion and some more thought into your cardplay.  Still very driven by the cards you draw before each encounter, though.  Has a "whack the leader" mentality to it.  A good pick if you like lots of talking trash and don't mind healthy doses of luck.

RATING: 8
A fun semi-cooperative game in which a group of players simultaneously team up to defeat a number of dungeon baddies while trying to ensure THEY do the killing blow.  Thought the length of the game can be adjusted, it still can be a bit lengthy, which is why it isn't pulled out often.  Still a very enjoyable game.

I realized that this is not the kind of game I like. No matter how great your plan or combo is it can and will be erased by a counter card. Some people find that thrilling, but I find it exhausting.

This game is definitely not for everyone- if you're one of these anal stats-strokers who gets "concerned" over probability ratios in a game or you're one of those fun-ruining control freaks who can't stand the thought of player interaction interfering with your chance to win a game, then run as fast as you can away from any table playing CUTTHROAT CAVERNS.  It's a simple take-that sort of card game that will appeal to folks who like games like NUCLEAR WAR, FAMILY BUSINESS, HEX HEX, and dare I say it?  MUNCHKIN.  The concept is fun (big monsters show up, an adventuring party tries to kill it, but whoever deals the coup de grace gets all the prestige- yeah, it's a killstealing game), the mechanics are easy, and the laughs bountiful.  No doubt, this is a great game to play with a rowdy, boisterous group- like I said, milquetoast accountants worried about the "chaos" element will sink this one quicker than the Lusitania in a bathtub full of U-Boats.  There's actually some pretty interesting design here beyond the fun theme and nasty gameplay as the encounters offer a huge variety of effects and serve to keep the game from dragging on beyond its welcome- some creatures will damage who ever hit them the hardest each round, others have tentacles that do all kinds of awful damage, and still others cause players to pass their hands after each attack.  You get the picture.  Of course, there's plenty of take that and counter cards to befuddle your opponents.  In a just world, this would be the game the RPGers cotton to over MUNCHKIN because it offers a simiilar take on the RPG card game concept but it's WAY more fun and a hell of lot shorter.  Good stuff, definitely an unexpected hit with my group.

Hmm... didn't make a comment yet.  Not a bad game.  You go down in a dungeon and beat up on things.  But it feels really random to me.  Maybe it was due to the fact that I was really tired when I played, I don't know.

With the second play I have to say that the game seems a little better.  Not something I would want to play a lot, but I guess I don't mind it.

I owned this because of the high praise it got from other respectable board game reviewers.  I just didn't like it.  The "take that" elements were too in your face for me, though I suppose if that's what you're into this game has a lot to offer for the size of its box.

I'm giving this game a 3 because I've only played it once - so I'm sure there is some crap I haven't uncovered about it yet.

I've never played Munchkin, and Cutthroat Caverns makes sure that I will do my best to avoid it. Constant backstabbing and stealing the spotlight from others while begrudgingly progressing through a dungeon of randomly selected monsters and trap rooms makes this a riot with the right group. Expansions give enough content to make sure that I'll never get bored of this game.

Feels like [i]Cosmic Encounter[/i] in a dungeon to me.

Which means I absolutely love it!

It's a truly evil game that forces the party to work together all the while looking for that opportune moment to stick the knife in (sometimes twisting it) and claim victory.  Too soon and everyone will die.  Too late and someone else will beat you to it.  Wunderbar!

Like Cosmic, it has a basic framework which is easily learned after one or two games and then that framework is turned upside down and inside out by the variety of encounter cards, much like the Alien cards.

My favorite "take that" game.  It has a two major things going for it.  First, players only want to knock others down enough to ensure they get points for killing the monster.  Knocking too many people down means the whole group fails.  Second, it plays over a fixed number of rounds.

Fairly light and mindless but I like it.

I didn't have  great experience with the game. For one I don't think the person teaching the game had a good grasp of the rules so we might have played it wrong. Through out the whole game there were several arguments about rules which didn't help to the enjoyment of the game. I would like to give it another try. However, from my first impression was that it was too chaotic for my taste and that the rules were not that clear.

So far I have only ever played with 3.  THe game seems like it could use a little more lethality.  I've been thinking of raising the HP of the monsters, or increasing their damage.  Some aspects of the rules are unintuitive. Let's say the monster attacks the player that deals the least amount of damage; one player plays a feint (which does 0 damage) and another plays an attack which does 5 damage, the player who hit for 5 will be the one attacked by the monster!  Also, at least in my group, timing issues with the action cards always seemed to crop up (I'm looking at you Edge Out).

RATING: 7.3
Fun little game - took a bit longer to play the first time through with six players learning the rules. Nobody really died which I was surprised about. Potions are an interesting commodity in the game as using them early in the game removes them from the later rounds, but prolonging their use allows others more time to steal them. Looking forward to more plays with perhaps a smaller group. I'm sure someone can come up with a 2-player variant for this. Didn't seem like they put enough prestige points in the original set for six players? Box is a bit small and wish it offered more room to carry around the expansion.

I come from Greece. I'm very glad I've bought this game with the expansion. It has very clever encounters, each needing a different strategy to win, using teamwork and sometimes betrayal. It has an RPG feeling and that is what I like most. I have used it to create adventures in the DnD campaign worlds -with a GM- and it has been a great success until now. Ofcourse you don't have to play it with a GM with the official rules.

THIS GAME HAS THE BEST QUALITY BOXES AND CARDS I'VE EVER SEEN!!! I HOPE THIS WILL BE CONTINUED IN TO THE FUTURE EXPANSIONS.

Many says it's Munchkin evolved. I see the points raised and i admit is fairly true.
Although i can say this is much better and less "forced" to be funny.
The fact that everyone is meant to help you to a certain extent is better than asking for help around. It's more difficult to screw someone over "just because". Do it too much and you'll suffer greatly as well. The backstabbing is way more well planned and the depth of the game is very good.
I'd recommend it with the Disclaimer "Guys.. It's just a game. Whatever happens in the game, stays in the game"

Looking at the components it really doesn't seem like there is much to this game, and really I don't think there is much to it. However how everything works, I just have to much fun. The conversations that go on while playing are pretty good as well, and it really shines since the group I play with is full of backstabers so ofcourse this game is perfect. Even when we die off, we do our best to convince others to screw over the leader, and make everyone lose. 

In our second game we had five people and all but two died off, nothing was better when the Blood Mage summoned Spite and one of the players realizing she wouldn't win just caused the battle to be impossible to win.

One last thing, the game is probably best with 4+ players.

I have only played this once, but it is not my type of game.  Furthermore, my 1 play lasted about 2 hours which is too long for this type of game.  The strategy is very light, which means the game is more about the social interactions.  But there are so many fiddly interactions with the cards, and so many things to think about, that most of the focus is on the game mechanics and not the other players. Although I enjoyed the first hour of this game, I grew increasingly tired of it over the 2nd hour.  But I should also mention that the other people playing all said they enjoyed it quite a lot.

Players are members of a party trying to escape a dungeon.  Clever card based dungeon hack game, where the party has to survive at least nine encounters to escape.  Player with the most prestige at the end wins.  The catch is, as you chip away at the monsters, reducing their hit points, only the player who deals the killing blow gets the prestige.  So you're all trying to defeat the beasts and move on, but pocket the prestige along the way.  Fun game that plays okay, despite the timing issues that always dog this sort of game.  Interesting blend of encounters to keep the game fresh.  Great ideas here, but perhaps a bit easy?  We all escaped and none of us were damaged too much.

Very light and simple game of kill-stealing.  Balances co-op play with back-stabbing, and essentially boils down to trying to pace your back-stabbing cards so that you don't play too many too soon.   Too friendly groups will get through all 9 encounters without anyone dying, and then it is just comes down to who wins the last one or two encounters.   Can be hilarious, but really depends on the group.   Probably the most group-dependant game I own.  Could also benefit from a richer game environment - special abilities, better selection of magic items.   Presumably the expansions will have that, but that's too much to invest in such a simple game.

The tag line for this game: "Without teamwork, you will never survive. Without betrayal, you will never win" is perfect.  Maybe the 'you'll never survive' part is a little embellished for the base game, however the expansion ramps up the difficulty of the encounters.  The various Encounters are really what makes this game interesting.  There is a lot of randomness but the game is not so long that it should really bother anyone whether you win or lose.  You might get upset, however, about the other players being the direct cause of your elimination from the game if you can't handle 'take that' style games. This game kind of fills a similar niche as Drakon though I definitely prefer Drakon mainly because it's easier to teach, there are virtually no rule complications, and people seem to be less sensitive to the 'take that' elements due to the lack of player elimination.

After one play all I can say is "Wow!"  This game is a great dungeon-type crawl.  I wish my fellow players had been more focused on teamwork than screwage, but it was still fun and tense. Would love to get back to this sooner than later. Some of the monsters in the encounters are pretty nasty...and require more team work...but in the end all I can do is agree with the cover phrase..."Without team work you won't survive, without betrayal you won't win!" That is the essence of the game.

Fun game; does a nice job of incorporating both cooperative and competitive elements.  Has a Munchkin feel to it (i.e., stick it to  your neighbor), but better and more serious because of the cooperative component.  Also, since you typically do 9 or so encounters, it does not go on and on forever. Adding bonus prestige to the last few encounters makes it easier for folks who are behind to catch up (which keeps it interesting until the end most of the time). 

I played two 3-player games with friends after buying the base set and we all really enjoyed it. So, I bought Tombs and Tomes (the third expansion with some nice additional mechanics and components) and played a 4-player game with the same friends +1 (also very fun).  So, I finally broke down and bought the rest of the expansions.  Looking forward to giving the new components, mechanics, and encounters a try. Will update these comments when I do.

Substantially drier than I had expected from reading the rules and feedback; plenty of chaos and "take-that" but no bluffing or meaningful alliances in our game.

When I returned to the hobby in 2008, I bought some games that sounded like "crazy fun" that didn't work out and were part of my self-education as to what types of games I do and do not like. I don't like take-that games, so I had little chance of liking this one in hindsight. This is just a more sophisticated version of Munchkin, and those games are aimed at a target audience of which I'm not a member. 

What particularly hindered it with my group was adjudicating the timing of some of the cards; way too much work for such a chaotic and light game.

Interesting and fun take that back stabbing and screwing each other over dungeon crawl game which is quite dependent upon the group you are playing with. 
If you group takes this with a pinch of salt and play for fun and banter then this works, but if you play this as a serious exercise then it probably won't be much fun as the mechanics themselves are pretty simple and repetitive.

Plenty of cards and simple but effective card abilities and very quick game play. 

The differing monsters for the encounters are really nice but it seems there are only 10 monsters for 10 encounters, it would have been nice if there were a few more monsters so you have the variety for replayability.

It is also a shame the amount of victory points jumps significantly at the end of the game which would allow a struggling player to catch up but actually leads to a situation where whoever wins the last encounter wins the game.

RATING: 6.5
Not my kind of game at all but I did like it and the game worked well for its genre. A dungeon bash without the dungeon, the players are presented with a series of encounter cards with various creatures. You play attack cards from your hand to drive down the monsters HPs, but only the player delivering the killer blow will take the prestige points as VPs. This means that the players are working as a team but actually plottng against each other all the time. You also have action cards that allow variations, such as letting another player take your damage, and potions and amulets and such like.

Nicely done for what it is, good design, lots of variety. But what it is, is a lot reading of rules on cards, working out turn order, working out damage and victory conditions and so on. Way too fiddly for my liking and too much back stabbing and screwage. But I do not deny it was a fun game, inventive, just not my cup of tea. If you like dungeon bashing, go for it!

Appropriately named.  Vicious little game where you can't get too far in the lead or you become the target, not the monster.  Expansions (which often irritate me for various reasons) are a must for this game.  More than once I have heard players comment that they wished the demons were just a little harder to kill.  I think though, that the game lasts the right amount of time--harder demons would extend the length of the game.

A dungeon-crawling game based around kill-stealing and backstabbing; it's very close to an RPG and doesn't penalise or restrict targeted aggressive interaction. These kind of games can be fun if with a good-natured group and fairly objective targeting criteria, but can become moody if feelings get hurt.

The mechanics are simple and loose but feel a bit flimsy and incoherent at times; the special effects really could be anything. The monsters are varied and switch up the strategies and backstabbing, though some are more frustrating than fun. The game lasts a little bit too long.

This is a clever design. It's simple to learn and does a great job of presenting a scenario that fosters "coopetition." The monsters can be a bit fiddly in their special abilities, but at least they're quite different from each other.

A lot of people hate the semi-coop idea with a passion. I love it but I dont really consider it semi coop, it is a competitive game.

I love the idea of an adventuring party where everyone is really in it for themselves and this game does a great job of implementimg that.

It is just a little too long and fiddly to really be a top game.

Great game!  A team of adventurers goes through a series of adventures, but the hook is only one of you can win...and the only way to get victory points is to be the player who lands a killing blow on a monster!

This leads to jockeying for position, playing cards to screw your opponents by having them trip before they can land their lethal strike...

It's not quite as deadly as I'd hoped.  Also, groupthink can ruin it.  It's a bit fragile in that if everyone isn't literally playing to win, you'll all survive and someone will sort of win at random.

I also wish that there were variable powers in the base set, but oh well.

Still, a fun adventure romp where you keep your friends close, and your enemies close to the monsters, and your blade.

After 4 years (!), finally get to play, and it's a good game.  Like the concept, and would play again (6/10/12 - rating 7). UPDATE: A good game, albeit too long for what it is (a card game of this type should not fill out the whole 3 hours).  Because of the time element, rating reduced by 1 to 6 (2/11/12). UPDATE (next day!) Actually, the more I think about it, I do like this game, It's just that It's not seemingly compatible with my playing group, rating back to 7  (3/11/12). UPDATE: I was right, not much interest in the game group, but I still do like the concept (Rating: 7.284, Sept 16)

Once I played this game for the first time, I had to get all the expansions right away. This game is so much fun! The backstabber of backstabbing games, I love playing this game with friends, family, and even with strangers who don't take things too personally. Going through a dungeon together, pretending to work together, and then trying to screw each other over and taking the kill. Definitely one of my favorites!

Also own:
-Deeper & Darker: Probably the least interesting expansion. Adds a few new fun monsters, but that is about it.
-Relics & Ruin: Adds the event and relic deck, which add a very cool new layer to the game that changes every single game from the next.
-Tombs & Tomes: More monsters, more events and more relics. More of the same, but that is a good thing with this game. Also comes with a story module, but have yet to try that.
-Fresh Meat: The box is a must if you have everything for this game, but this expansion also comes with really great character customization cards, which give your character a more unique feeling.

The general idea is very cool and we had fun playing for the first time. Some situations that arose during play were unclear (specific card combinations). The game felt a little bit too long. I'm not sure how strategic and random it is. Probably too random for the time it takes to play. All in all the idea of fighting monsters this way, cooperating and stabbing each other in the back is very fun.

I haven't gotten it to the table because it requires at least 3 and the rulebook has not been very helpful during my play test. A lot of cards raise questions about how they can be played. Was hesitant to bring it out with new players so had to sell it. No real interest in playing this anymore.

A fairly mediocre game.  A bit too much luck, players has some control over thier fates but not alot.  It mostly comes down to the random card draws and how spitefull/petty players are feeling.

Game is a lot of fun, doesn't seem repetitive. One player got knocked out early and didn't enjoy playing as much. Cards are sometimes very confusing, and the rules could be MUCH clearer. We slogged through, but I wouldn't be surprised if we got a few things wrong.
But great fun, wild turnabouts, and everyone (but dead guy) had a chance to win till the end.

Nice artwork and creative encounters in a lightweight and chaotic card game.  Things turn on a dime, many rules exceptions and resulting ambiguities, and despite being only 10 encounters, plays long for what it is, very much like Munchkin, etc. can.  I personally don't like this type of game, and this one isn't anything special for it's type.  If you're an RPG crossover who likes Munchkin though, I would check it out.

Love the tension between letting your teammates die and get hurt and your need of them for the tough encounters.

Very good game.  Expect tons and tons of take that, though.  Nevertheless, sometimes your plans do work, you get the last strike and you feel very, very smart.  I suspect this game needs a certain type of group to play.  Certainly needs a group with no scruples about constantly screwing the other heroes.  This is *not* a co-op game.  I'm afraid I could never get that group together so I probably won't buy this--like to play it though.

With the right crowd this game is fun.

Played for the first time last night and really enjoyed it. My only complaint at this point is that it just didn't seem very "dangerous" to me. We may be playing the game all wrong, but at no point was any character in danger of dying. We thwarted one another's moves as best we could to jockey for the killing blows, but the monsters themselves seemed pretty weak, really. The nice thing about the game is the way it scales. We could, if we wanted to, up the scale as if more players were in the game to make the monsters more challenging. We will play again because we all liked it. I would be interested in seeing how it plays with 5 or 6 players, since there were only three of us.

After playing twice, I still think many of the encounters are just too easy, but on the whole, we have a great deal of fun playing the game and are constantly trying to one-up each other on the action cards.

I like this game, but it seems to have a negative reaction with the staunch Euro AoS crowd. Ameritrash lovers usually enjoy it.
I like the idea of working together for half the game and then trying to eliminate a few other players to claim victory towards the end, but I usually only have a minor impact on who takes what damage. I have played with the first expansion, but haven't tried all the other expansions I own yet. I hope they improve the game as I like it a lot so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I currently own all of the expansions to this game. I love the "stab in the back" nature of it, and how the mechanics change based on each new monster your group encounters. But it does have player elimination, which kinda sucks. You have to dedicate at least an hour or so for a game, and if someone gets real dead real fast, then there is no way to get them back in the game. Unless you have the Tombs and Tomes expansion, which add a story element and creates a real dungeon delving experience with choices, and unique encounters that rival the best D&D modules. It's great, but you're going to spend two hours on those games, and once again, someone can get dead early on, and now they have nothing to do for AN HOUR!  If there was a way to get eliminated players back in the game, I would give this a confident 10 out of 10, but that single issue brings it down to an 8. If you don't have the right group, it can also affect your enjoyment of this game. DO NOT PLAY WITH ANGRY GAMERS. Not only because of the elimination thing, but because of the backstabing. There is a lot of it, and it's brutal.

I wanted this to be more enjoyable than it is. Seems like most of what I am doing is housekeeping: deal out initiative, play one card, add up damage, mark on damage track, mark my own damage, draw one card (reshuffle deck?), gather initiative cards, repeat. It can be interesting to imagine what your opponents will try and do and working to play the right card to kill the monster, but it is too easy for another player to cancel your attack. I have never liked games where there are cards that simply cancel another action. In this game it means that a kill usually feels anti-climatic. You do not kill a monster because you played well but because your opponents were not dealt enough countering cards to stop you. 

-Feels alot like Red Dragon Inn. Not the highest praise from me as I think that is synonymous with "interesting idea, not much of a game". 
-Too long. I will not play the full 9 encounters. Would like the game to last about 60 minutes (usually lasts at least 90). There just isn't enough depth for it to be more than that.
-Repetitive: even though the encounters are well designed, your actions are still the same every turn. 
-My games so far have come down to whoever wins the final encounter. Makes the rest of the game seem pointless.

RATING: 7
You want to get the finishing blow and avoid being killed yourself and so does everyone else. But you have to cooperate somewhat in order to keep the party alive, since you are chanceless alone. That is the basic premise of Cutthroat Caverns and it honestly makes the game. It is a highly tactical game where you each round play cards in order to tear the monster down. What’s really good with this is that it is finite and not an endless game which Munchkin can degenerate to.  It sure is a lighthearted game, but it is one of the better in that genre.

The best "take that" game that I've played in a long time, maybe the best "take that" game of all time. My rating is high but reflects where this game falls in its niche. I don't see myself playing a lot of Nuclear War, Brawling Battleships, or Kung Fu Fighting now that this game is in the collection. This game has pretty tight design, good theme, clear and functional components, and something that is a genuine rarity in this hobby -- legitimate art design. Not only does the game look good, but the pieces of the game look good together. Given that the art was done by dozens of different artists (each nicely credited in the rules), there must have been a steady hand at the art director's position to ensure that all the art looks like it belongs in the same world. Our crowning moment so far was when all five of us succumbed to "Hate" in the last room, with the final player dying for want of five more points of attack. A very nice surprise from a game that was a total shot in the dark for me.

I played this once, and found it to be no better than "OK."  Two caveats to that assessment:  It seems like the kind of game with a definite "ah ha!" factor.  In other words, after some experience, I'm guessing you start to "get it" and the enjoyment factor probably goes up noticeably.  (Yes, that happens in all games, but some more than others.)  Also, I played with 6, and I think that's probably not optimal; 4 would likely have been better.

In any event, the game doesn't strike me as [i]bad[/i], but it's not one I'm likely to put on my wishlist or ask to play again.  Pretty much any time I'd be in the mood for a "Take that!" card game with a light fantasy theme, I'd [i]prefer[/i] playing Red Dragon Inn.

Not bad for a take that game. The monsters/rooms are extremely varied and present interesting challenges.

Very fun, lighthearted game of backstabbing and plotting. Quite random but does allow you to plan a bit ahead.

But if you just skip lightly over those parts, this runs very smoothly.

I adore this game. Despite the title, it's very possible to play this in a more cooperative fashion. In fact, you will be punished for being overly cutthroat. Yet almost every game will feature a moment or two of ganging up on the leader or timely betrayal for selfish gain. It's a really nice balance, as almost all the "cutthroat" acts are really motivated by self-advancement, not by simply choosing someone to pick on. 

My favorite cards in this game are the ones that exemplify traits of game theory like Prisoner's Dilemma, etc. But even just teaming up together to bash a nasty monster or deal with a non-combat room can be a great experience. Lots of variety in the cards leads to a very tactical experience with little room for overarching strategies. Expansions multiply this variety exponentially. 

It's been said before, but it's a fairly apt descriptor: this game is like Munchkin, if Munchkin was actually good.

Extremely fun game.

I played this once in December of 2009 with 6 players and at the time I thought it was some of the most fun I've ever had in a boardgame. Three years later, in December of 2012, I bought the game and played it a second time, this time with 5, and it's still an extremely fun game. While the rule ambiguities were a bit annoying, they can be solved on the spot with a bit of negotiation or a coin toss. It's no different than in Cosmic Encounter, when you encounter unusual power combos. Aside from that the game was a huge success. Very exciting and fun. I'm sure this one will get loads of plays.

The cutthroat aspect is really beautifully implemented in this one.. you don't want everyone to die.. but you also don't want the others to kill the monster with the last hit.
The backstabbing is not as evil as in other games.. and people usually concentrate on the player in the lead..
Due to this & the high degree of randomness winning is also quite random.. in our round the person with the least points won the game by being lucky and getting the last hit on the last monster.

Fun ameri-trash game.

Reminds me a lot of Cosmic Encounter, minus a lot of the fun.  There's more screwage and a minor amount of cooperation but the cards are too far over the place.  If one player gets the big attack cards at the right time, you just can't beat that.  Or if he gets the invincibility potion.  There just aren't enough ways to mitigate other players' cards, making it a bit too random.  It's still a bit of fun, especially those 'gotcha' moments, but if we're playing a game in this vein of play style, I'd much rather play CE.

Man, I really want to like this one.

One member of our game group had a very bad experience with this and shared his pain with the rest of us; it's gonna be really hard to convince anyone to give this another shot...

The one time I did manage to get a three-player game it was marred by too few players and the fact that the other two were absolutely not into it.  Suck, suck & suck.

Hopefully I can turn this around at some point.

UPDATE:  After playing an actual game of this with three enthusiastic delvers and one veteran (thanks, Josh!) all I can say is that the well-poisoner who hated on it was smokin' wack.  Even Anna, who stated up front that she's not a fan of "backstabby" games, was smitten.

There is a delicious tension in the competitive co-op; in the first room we ran into the Ripper and spent a good deal of time screwing around before the deathblow fell.  In the second room we met the dread Hydra, and after doing the calculations of multi-headed attacks vs. our remaining life points we realized that we couldn't afford to goof off at all—it would take an all-out joint effort just to keep the party alive.

Truly, truly the game requires an [i]intelligent[/i] balance between take-that backstabbery and co-op play—monkey around too much and everyone dies.  One must think of one's comrades as tools to get you to the finalish rooms, perhaps a bit beat up, before going whole hog with the betrayal...

Good game with a few nice twists.  I like the fact that each game is different.  Even if you happen to face the same monsters in two consecutive games (quite unlikely), the distribution of cards in your hands and the order in which monsters appear make for a different experience.  It pays to play agressivelly, because the games are much more fun... at the same time more deadly... It is good to have more than one way to victory.  If you leg behind with score, concentrate on weakening your opponents and if you play your cards right, you may end up the only living party member to escape from the caverns.  I cannot wait for future expansions with new monsters and mechanics.  

My only gripe with the game is that the monsters in the base set are TOO WEAK.  In many cases, they will not last for a single round and are instantly killed.  The expansion is much better in that regard.

What Munchkin should had been.

Gameplay shifts from pure cooperative to pure confrontational depending of what players think: "we have all under control" or "help, we're going to die!" Very funny and original premise. Also, there is no snowball effect, so you always have a chance of winning.

The expansions push the replayability of this game to astronomical levels.

Game design is not very clean. It's not broken, but has lots of rules and exceptions for a comparatively much simpler gameplay. Thankfully, the rules are quite clear, althought you'll need some time to read them.

Didn't have the level of backstabbing I had expected it to. We played with the max player count and most of the monsters were pretty easy. Sometimes you didn't even get a chance to play a card before the monster was dead.

I didn't like it. I heard good things and was quite anxious to play this, but it's way too random for my liking. I could accept this, if the game would take up to about 60mins to play, but ~150mins of randomness isn't very much fun in my book. Much too long for what this game is. I would rather play Munchkin (man I didn't hear myself say this sentence in a looong time ;))

Despite some nitpicky FAQ stuff that you have to print out to avoid wasted arguments about "timing", this is a very fun and excellently themed game which can really shine in the right crowd (read: semi-sober dungeon crawlers who don't whine about being backstabbed).

RATING: 7
I like this game, but it's a pain in the butt to teach because of all the "interrupt" cards.  It's easy to misread a lot of cards the first time through and it's hard to get the pacing of the game right so that people can jump in at the right times.  So basically there will be a lot of sheparding and correcting and explaining with new players.  Also there are a lot of weird situations that can come up that aren't explicitly covered in the rules.  Plus some of the rules are just awkward, like monsters that deal damage based on initiative cards.  One more thing!  This is a game that depends on the group more than most games.  If the group isn't alert about causing mischief with their action cards and willing to screw each other over it's going to suck.

In spite of the down sides, though, I think it's pretty fun.  And with a group that is familiar with the game and excited about screwing each other over it would be great.

I played this with 6 people, it was definitely not the showcase number of players for this game.  If everyone is in a 'Take that!' kind of mood, I could see this being enjoyable.  But I am not in that mood a lot.  I call the feeling you get playing this the 'Kill Dr. Lucky' syndrome.

Nice to see a dungeon quest done as a card game, but the action cards mean that the atmosphere tends to be humourous rather than dark. Hugely chaotic in both the card draw and the blind play, so it may be an idea to reduce the number of monsters to keep playing time to an hour.

With only one play under my belt, I have to say I am a fan of cutthroat caverns.  The whole concept appeals very much to me.  I like munchkin and similar back-stabbing games, however the problem is that sometimes it can drive people away.  That is where cutthroat caverns shines; by forcing people to cooperate in order to survive they retain some of the team feeling, but still allows people to get their feel of lonewolfing.

I had heard over and over again that Cutthroat Caverns mercifully replaces Munchkin for many gamers. It is certainly a better game, but I didn't find myself enjoying it much on its own terms.

The game, while actually having a good structure and some interesting ideas, has some clunky rules and felt very random and dependent upon the whims of the player. I'd certainly try it again, but I'm not clamoring for it.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (January 2011)

Total CHAOS. I like the game but it is very hard to predict what your opponents will do, who will screw you first or who will lend you a helping hand. So to win the game you need lady luck on your side. 

The theme is awesome and the game is more chaotic with each expansion you add to it. As I said before I like the game but I’m not that much into chaos games, but if it is your thing go for it, you won´t regret it.

I have noticed hurt feelings due to betrayals in the game, which I love to see and is one of the perks that DO attract me to the game (the other one is the theme).

On the bad side I feel it takes a long time to play this.

Nowadays, I almost always dislike games that have the (almost) pointless “bash the leader”, “take that” and “in your face” mechanics. I have changed over the years and (mostly) I no longer enjoy this type of game (I also downgraded Survive). So I’m downgrading the rating of Cutthroat Caverns to a new one that matches my new feelings toward the game.

I almost always resist a game of this, the theme and art are great but I prefer to play other games with more meaningful decisions. I`m glad I didn’t buy this.

Cutthroat Caverns is amusingly themed and does exactly what it sets out to do.  Also I've met the designer and you won't find a nicer guy anywhere.  He deserves to have made a successful game.

Unfortunately I personally hated every minute I was playing it because it was an endless cycle of screwing other players and getting screwed.  I have to rate Cutthroat Caverns low as I have no interest in ever playing again, but I do so with regrets.  Many gamers with much different tastes than my own will (and do) adore it.

The concept is brilliant. I desperately want to like this game. I would play it again just because the idea is great. However, it is much too plagued with vagaries. Some terms are not at all well-defined, which makes rules adjudication and timing issues impossible to determine. Can I counter an Attack Card AFTER someone has played an Action Card that doubled it? Or can I only negate the Attack Card as soon as it's revealed and before anyone changes the value? I know for sure this rating would go up to AT LEAST an 8 if these things were to be fixed in a future edition. I can't stand a ruleset that leaves important game-determing moments up to a majority vote.

RATING: 6
Good game.  I like the way that you have to decide whether you co-op with the other players or not, because it is the final blow to the monster that grants victory points and the most victory points in the game wins - of course.  Maybe a little long for what it is based on the rules state to play, but you can adjust the length by reducing the number of monster encounters.  Played first game with six and just as the game is called it was pretty cutthroat.

Not as fun a once thought lowered my rating from 7 to 6.  Very painful game with 6 players.

What?!  The name says it all.  This game takes the RPG typical adventure ad turns it on his head.  Adventurers are on the same team, cooperatively trying to take down monsters and face confrontations of varying types.   BUT... in a twist that results in a ton of fun, all players are competing to be the one who kills the monster, gaining the points for killing him.  Everyone else, no matter how much they participated in taking the monster down, gets nothing.  This results in a fair amount of strategy and a push-pull type of game mechanic where every player wants to hit the monster some, but not too hard, lest they create an opportunity for someone else to kill steal the monster out from under your nose!  

Of course, the game supplies a deck of tools for one to help backstab the other player, stop them from attacking, double your own attack power, etc...  All this creates a chaotic environment wherein everyone is for themselves, but if everyone decides not to work together, then no one will make it out of the caverns alive, meaning there will be no winner.  I love love love this type of setup.  Usually the chaos involves plenty of opportunities for someone to think they have a monster dead, only to find that someone kill-steals it from them or that you have been stopped from your awesome onslaught and now everyone takes damage instead!  A very fun game with the right crowd.  Don't wear your feelings on your sleeve with this one... it can get ugly, but it's all in the name of fun.

Cutthroat Caverns is a diamond in the rough. 

Many games of this theme and style fall flat, dragging on for ages with rinse-repeat gameplay and utterly failing to create an atmosphere with lazy flavor text on inconsequential cards. It's about time someone got it right. 

Once again, players are a band of elves/dwarves/rogues/barbarians/not-this-****-again. Kill monsters. Complete Dungeons. Le Sigh. Fortunately, the central idea of the game is both unusual and risky. Basically it's a cooperative game that only one person can win. If you compete with each other right away, you'll all die. If you cooperate too much, you probably won't win. Finding the right balance is the whole game. Lots of quick card play, lots of shenanigans, lots of fist-shaking, lots of fun. I'd put this in the same class as [thing=24068][/thing]: good at what is does and a nice change of pace.

I could handle this one if it played in 45 minutes. With explanation it's around a two hour game. It's OK fighting a monster or two then it gets really boring.

There is nothing really interesting to do in this one, unless you want to play "take that." The problem is those moves usually hurt the other guy but they don't really help you, so you end up constantly playing kingmaker. 

It seems to be an end of the night game as well and it's kinda mathy.

Even though we got a rule wrong (which essentially made the game harder), this type of game just isn't very interesting to me, mainly because of the theme.  I had anticipated that the "cutthroat" part of the game would have been stronger, when in fact it amounts to basic "take that" cardplay, not really any type of backstabbing.  The actual mechanisms of the game are quite boring, I think you would need players to get into the spirit of the game to really make it enjoyable.

A filler game of monster-bashing and backstabbing the other players.

Well, it's chaotic alright.
It went over so-so with my group.  A couple of us liked it; the variety, the chaos, the back-stabbing, etc.
A couple in the group thought it simply too crazy, rule-laden (exceptions to the-) and long for what it offered.
I like it, but couldn't grant it anything too lofty; a 6.5 feels about right.
Good points for the variety, different feel of each game, clever card play, artwork.
Bad points for length and feeling somewhat out of control.

If you love to knock other players down a notch and keep them from reaching their goals this is the game for you! This game is both co-op and pvp. So you play together to defeat the enemy but in order to win you have to have the most victory points at the end and the only way to achive that is to have the last kill for the enemy go to you so keeping other players from dealing that final blow is desired! Beware that depending on the company you are playing with some might be sour sports.

While I love highly interactive games, this game does it in all the wrong ways. Filled with clever ability names such as "Critical Miss" and 1960s Batman inspired artwork, the atmosphere this game provides is mundane at best. Bosses are either boring or add to the already excessive playing time. The Take That is mostly permission based; everyone hates U in Magic for a reason. The worst, however, is determining player order after every, single combat round. Ugh.

Cutthroat Caverns is really fun! 
One the one side you have to team up with the other players in your group, on the other side you will backstab them just to get the killing blow on the actual encounter...
You shouldn't play this game with people which take some serious backstabbing personally... The fact that the base game comes with over 20 encounters, from which are only nine used randomly and the expansions which adds the encounters up to 75 will et you experience a different game everytime this hits the table. I like it a lot!

Ultimately it just felt like dumb luck whether you got the cards you needed to beat monsters and score points.

Not a game to play in a WBC tournmanet but very fun among friends.  Backstabbing and deception humorous rather than mean.  Sometimes one card can mean a lot more victory points than another, which reduces the importance of the others.

Probably my favorite game at the moment.  This game requires a bit of imagination and a lot of backstabbing!  Working together with friends to bring down big bad and ugly while trying to sneak in the final shot on the monster to gain all the glory!  Me and my friends get REALLY into this game, and the replay value is HIGH!  Great strategy game

*I've actually played this 4 or 5 times but haven't recorded the plays.  It has a low rating because although I thought I'd love it when I bought it, it just doesn't really do it for me.  It seems too long for what it is, maybe?

RATING: 8
Cutthroat Caverns is played over 9 rounds, each with a random encounter. Essentially a game of 'kill stealing'. Each round, any monster encountered will have a prestige value of 1 through 6. The player that successfully jockeys for position and lands the killing blow gets the prestige value for the encounter. Some encounters will not have a specific monster, such as a trap room for the heroes to pass through (and in this case, earning no prestige). The surviving player with the most prestige after the 9 encounters is the winner. If the players do not survive all 9 encounters, no one wins the game.A unique combination of cooperative game play and opportunistic backstabbing.

Glad I got to try before I bought.  This game was on my radar for a while as I was curious how it played out with the combination of cooperative play while also stabbing each other in the back.  For the type of game it is, I'm sure it fills its niche well.  Unfortunately, this just isn't my type of game as this is pretty much a chaotic, take that type of card game with a little opportunity for strategic play on a very limited basis.  For RPG fans, I could see this being a fun, lighthearted, short filler.
=========================
So, after receiving the game as a sweetener in a math trade, I pulled it out with some of the college crowd.  They loved it and even I got a bit sucked into the game despite being killed mid-game.  This is one of those games that is very player dependent - hence the role playing comment above.  Play this for the experience with a good group of people who love to interact and backstab and this game will be fun.  Attempt to play this game strategically and you will be frustrated.

Very enjoyable card game.  The system poses an interesting situation:  you must play co-op to survive but backstab to win.  Monster and character cards have wonderful artwork.  Attack, action and item cards have no artwork.  Scales well between 3 and 4 players (haven't played with more).  Downtime may be a problem, however.

RATING: N/A
You need your party members to survive, but they aren't your friend, and only one person can walk out with the glory in Cutthroat Caverns. 6 adventurers venture into a dungeon to find unspeakable horrors. If you die, you'll earn nothing, but the rewards only go to the player who can land the killing blow. Throw strong players under the bus, intentionally miss a shot on a monster, and make others pay in this game of prediction and anticipation.

The idea of this game is pretty neat, but is very susceptible to "if I can't have it, then nobody can" players. That's one reason I got rid of it.

The main reason I traded this game away, though, is that ties are an unholy nightmare to resolve. Each time you have a "tie situation", players tied for most damage or least damage, things are resolved differently for every. single. monster. And you don't know unless you look it up online. 

Seriously. Sometimes "most" means "all of the most". Second means "second most", unless there are ties for first, in which case second really means "third most". Except in certain monster events where first and second would be the two tied for first. Or Tuesdays. Or if the monster is Hate, where you are supposed to discard everything and do it all over again. But only if you looked it up online.

It's a game about optimizing your hand to totally fuck both your friends and a randomly drawn monster at the center of the damn thing.  You can only win if your friends don't, but you need those friends to win? Sound compicated? It's not! It's a very quick rules explanation! I xplained to five people who were actively hitting a bong! Granted, one of those bastards knocked both himself and I out of the fucking game with one intensely bad card play, but in a testament to what a geat game this is, I ACTUALLY ENJOYED THAT TOO.

Dungeon crawling, semi-cooperative gameplay, and screwage all using cards and playable in 45-60 minutes. Very fun game with lots of replayability.

Had a great time playing this.  Played with most of the expansions, and there is just a ton of variety, but yet still not to difficult to learn.

In my game, I had an encounter where I had to flip a coin to see if I took poison damage and had to keep flipping until I flipped a tails.  Needless to say, I flipped heads 8 times in a row!  If we didn't defeat the encounter during the first turn, I was a dead man.  But my fellow team pulled it out for me.  A few rounds later, we got the encounter where everyone switches seat positions and that threw the whole game on its head.  

On the negative side - it can take a bit long if players are going to argue over the wording of the cards or encounters.  

Edit: Just played this again with 6.  Ugh, too chaotic and long.  Group wasn't getting into it.  Dropped my rating to a 6.5.

Our group loved this game!  I think the fact that its always so apparent that someone takes an action to score points, so people aren't angry.

My favorite not really a co-op game.  It is fun has a lot of variety no game is every the same.  Lots of games claim this but this game is correct in that no games are the same.  You have to decide when to go for victory and all of your "friends" are doing the same thing.  A very fun (maybe a bit long) game.

Really great balance between forcing you to not TOTALLY screw the others, but getting them just to the brink so that as the end you can swoop in and destroy them all. I love the theme, I think the mechanics are really well done and thought out, spot on balance and it really lends itself to repeat plays as there are so many factors that can dramatically change the way an encounter plays out.

Cutthroat Caverns is a light card game in which intrepid explorers enter a dungeon together to slay evil creatures, and garner prestige.  The player with the most points at the end, or the last player alive, wins.  There is a twist.  Only the player who strikes the killing blow to a creature gets the points.  Because of this players try whatever they can to disrupt each others' plans, and snatch victory away.

Cutthroat Caverns is a good little game, with some laughs and unexpected twists.  The silliness of the game takes the edge off of the constant backstabbing that goes on.  Give it a try.

This is another one of those games that is amazing with the right group. If you are tired, like I am, of munchkin addicts, introduce them to this, you won't be sorry. Get the expansion that adds differences to the adventurers.

Players have to work together to defeat the challenges, but only one can land the death blow, everyone else gets nothing. So this leads to negotiation, inevitable betrayals, laughter and squeals of outrage. Make sure your group can handle that.

Rating rises from 8 to 9 and falls again to an 8.  I'm happy that this has been hitting the table more often.  I always have fun with this one.  It's back to 8 because I don't feel the urge to play it as often as I used to.

It's compact and it scales well from 3-6 players, so I almost always bring it along to game night.

My only beef is that the length of a game varies wildly--it can run 40 minutes, or it can run two hours.  You might be able to control it somewhat by populating your encounter deck with carefully-chosen monsters.  This seems to be diminishing the more we play, so maybe it's just my group.

RATING: 4
Reminds me of Kill Dr. Lucky - it is a long "take that" style game.  Very little incentive is given to do damage to a monster as you are usually just helping the next person in line.  Random initiative irks me as well.

On the bright side I found the components to be very nice; I thought the artwork was well done.

Unfortunately this genre leaves me cold.  If a "take that" style game is short I can usually stand it.  This one outstays it welcome.  

There are too many restrictions on certain cards and too many cancellation (blue) cards which led me to complete frustration.

For example, if I use two potions and then setup a 200 point attack with a multiple card combo one card should not be able to void my entire turn.  Sure it might void one attack but not everything...

I feel with a bit more playtesting this game could be improved.  It would take me a lot of convincing to give it another shot though.

The theme might be similar to munchkin, but don't let that fool you - this is a real game.

Play is highly tactical, but I wish there were a greater cooperative aspect, as advertised - I don't think the monsters are really strong enough to force us to work together to defeat them. Luck (initiative card draws) also plays a strong role.

Overall, I like this game a lot - but I think with some tweaks, it could be a lot better.

Had a blast with this one, although the action cards seem WAY too good and winning the later encounters pretty much gets you the win regardless of how well you did in early encounters.  They did to balance this game a little better in terms of prestige points.

Played some unlogged solo games of this to get a sense of the mechanics and just ended up feeling "meh" about the whole thing. If I wanted a dungeon crawl, I'd play D&D or Descent. If I wanted something backstabby I'd play Intrigue or Diplomacy.

Traded away.

--------------------------------------

Played a full 4 player game of this when a friend brought it to a gaming day. Utterly meh. Just tedious and random--plenty of take-that game play, but no actual negotiation so there wasn't any real backstabbing taking place. I would prefer not to play it again.

This social game is ideal for an animated group of players.  It's almost a "heavy party game."  The game is a bit too long for non-gamers, however.  The encounters are fun, especially the first time.  My gaming group enjoyed our first play. I'm not sure my rating will sustain itself, however, as replayability may be limited.  Componentwise, the hit point stones were a pain to deal with;  there are a dozen other ways to track this information in a game like this, all of them better.

Certainly a much improved version of Munchkin. Still, it's not much of a game but if you are looking for a take-that experience you will surely enjoy this for a couple of games. Some expansions will keep you intrigued for longer for sure.

I still think the game drags out a bit too long when you think about how light it is. If you are fine with that, you will get some laughs out of this in a right group.

A co-operative game where a band of heroes take on dungeons and the denizens within to earn loot and equipment. 

The trick is that the players can turn on each other at any time in the hope of taking out their fellow adventurers to claim the goods and fame for themselves.

Knowing how long you need to keep companions around for and when to knife them is the key and can lead to some fun moments.

Not a bad game with the right group.

RATING: 6
Each player has a character with 100 hit points. Each round, there is a random monster encounter. Each round, the player order of attack is decided randomly. Whoever deals the killing blow to the monster gets the VPs for the monster. In this card driven game, damage is delivered from the value on the card. There are also potion cards which give special abilities and interrupt type cards which can disrupt other player's cards. Each monster also has special abilities and can do damage to the players.

This is a very light, random game. If you just enjoy sitting back, have cards flying back and forth, some cancelling, some getting through, then you will enjoy this game. I think the younger generation will enjoy this game. It's not really my type of game.

A card game that involves a lot of cards that counter one another, sometimes to the point of ridiculousness.  Although I have nothing against player elimination games, this game allows elimination extremely early on, making necessary to have filler games available for those who drop out.  Despite this, I like the combat mechanic and the shear wickedness that this game can inspire.  Simple game mechanics that are easy to grasp, good game flow.  Excellent art.

Played this tonight and I thought it was phenomenal.  I thought it was like Munchkin which I have played once but I didn't really like it.  Granted it was a very large game but, I like games that are...cutthroat.  I like to be vindictive in a game.  I don't like the, hey who wants to help me aspect of Munchkin.  In Cutthroat caverns, any act of help, is truly for yourself.  It was gnarly and awesome.  I will buy this.

RATING: 3
I think the "competitive cooperative" style is a novel concept, theme is cool, nice components, etc. 

There is strategy, but random "screw you over" mechanics make it so your strategies almost never actually work. I had a hard time enjoying this game due to a constant feeling of frustration and futility. 

Perhaps I just wasn't in the mood for this type of game at the time and I can see how I may enjoy this more under different circumstances (the group playing it may make a difference). If someone convinces me to play it again, I may revise my score.

This is a fun light game that is good as a change of pace.  I found the cooperative/competitive tension interesting, and it makes the game what it is.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

As they say, it's a game of "kill stealing".: you have to cooperate and then backstab everybody to get the kill and the points.

For me, the game is too uncontrollable and too long (90 minutes and tension concentrated only in the key moments of the kill).

The game works and will have its niche of lovers, but it's not for me. Not at all.

Oh I love this game.  The dungeon crawl theme is fantastic and the "work together/screw each other over" design makes for some agonizing decisions.  You have to make absolutely sure that you are playing this with a good natured group or real life enemies will be made very very quickly.

First impression (5 players): A game with cooperative elements but where you need to be greedy. There is plenty of chaos and (very) powerful action cards. The gameplay actually is quite smooth and more of a beer & pretzels type of a game. Probably at it's best with 5-6 players even if it makes game a longer.

Cooperative and Cutthroat! The recipe for a great game! After one play with our game group, all six of us agreed that we liked this one (which is kind of rare)! I was worried that it would be too cutthroat and people would get angry! But you know what...I think Small World may be more cutthroat than this game or maybe they are both really similar...I'm not sure which! Anyway, I love the whole package! 

You are a group of adventurers that must pass through nine encounters...that stand in your way...from escape and victory! Monsters, traps, and other special encounters...a super mix of events that make every game unique! But only the adventurer that delivers the final blow to the monster will get the prestige needed to win the game! So, your cards allow you to trip up your fellow travelers, so you can be the most prestigious! So good!

Great components sure, but turn after turn all you're trying to do is guess what the other players are going to do, and hope you're in the right spot in the turn order to take advantage, and that you're lucky enough to collect the cards to be able to take advantage - if you guess right.

If Cosmic Encounter was never designed, this game would fill the void.

Neat, fun dungeon-crawlish card game. Semi-coop with player elimination. Race to get credit for dealing the final blows to about 9 baddies. I think of this as an convoluted, twisted, trick-taking card game. Better with expansion(s), and 4 or more players.

This could be a gateway game for people who are okay with fantasy/fighting/monster themes and with reading text on cards.

Essentially, diceless D&D with a novel kill-stealing mechanic layered in. Not a game to be played with super-competitive players, as everyone loses if everyone dies, and spiteful types (or those that don't play well with teams) can sink the game early. It's otherwise great fun, with good variety in the encounter types and decent artwork. Loses a point for sometimes awkwardly worded rules and card text that occasionally stalls the game while house amendments are worked out and agreed on.

Cutthroat Caverns is a competitive card game about trying to get the killing blow on a series of monsters.  Each round, the adventurers are presented with a new monster worth a certain amount of experience points.  Not only can you play cards to do damage to the monster, you can also mess with other players such that they miss, or even better, they do enough damage such that the monster stays alive long enough for you to kill.  Suffice to say, the game is full of take-that interaction.  It's the kind of game that's great if you're into that sort of thing, as evidenced by the multitude of expansions.  Not really my cup of tea, though.

In this game, players hit monsters, but only the player who does the final blow kills, so you want to try to wear it down but not too much, but then it attacks people, so there should be an interesting push your luck tension. The problem is there are tons of super powerful action cards that make the game completely unpredictable and eliminate most of the strategy. The games does have a nice sense of humor, which is nice.

RATING: 2
A really stupid game, where you have to pass 9 random encounters to finish the game. The person with the most points (usually the one who finished the most monsters) is the winner.

"Random" is the key word here. Initiative (player order) is random, and so is winning. You don't know what the other players are going to do, and so it doesn't matter a lot what YOU are doing yourself. In the end, you play a card and hope it actually does something until one of the players wins by random happenchance. One of the worst cardgames I have ever played.

Let us be clear: this is not a game about teamwork with some backstabbing.  This is a game of constant sabotage that occasionally requires you to overcome your differences and work together.

Every new monster you fight really throws something completely new and different at you. However, you will find yourself cycling through the very limited selection of attack cards quickly and falling prey to the same tactics from other players time and again.  More card variety would have been nice.

Does not work well with 3 players.  Play with 4+

Glory-seekers, madmen, and knights, venturing inside a dungeon full of formidable foes. Their common goal: to garner a reputation for being the best fiend slayer. In this game players are pitted against one another to land the killing blow on the monster, only then can they gain glory. Players will need to work together to ensure that they survive the encounter, for the fiends are too strong for only one adventurer to fight off. The great thing about this game is how tense action sequences can be. The main thing to keep in mind is to never trust anyone you're playing with as everyone is only in it for themselves.

After two plays... rating may rise after more experience with this one.  Luck factor is REALLY high in this one, but there are still decisions to be made.  It's like a light and streamlined game of D&D.  I like it pretty well, but don't go into this one assuming you will best someone with a methodical, long-term strategy - this game is chaos :)

A good dungeon crawler with cards.  Enough backstabbing and non-standard encounters to keep it from being a pure grind, but fairly repetitive.  However, this would be a perfect 4 player prequel to The Red Dragon Inn.

Usually when I see card games like these that "support" up to 6 players, I naturally expect them to only play well with maybe 3-4 players. Not Cutthroat Caverns! This does a fine job of accommodating 6 players. 

This isn't so much about strategy as it is about tactics. Your initiative/turn order decides your actions for the most part, with some very interesting twists added by the huge variety in enemy cards.

Overall: A fun little party game that I'd have a tough time turning down.

I have only ever played this once, with a friend's copy - it was ages ago (away back in 2011), but was such a disaster it hasn't come to the table since and I doubt it ever will again. The concept seemed interesting, but the rules were so awful and ambiguous that it just caused arguments and led to everyone going home early in a huff. I'm sure there's some kind of game worth playing in there, but the first impression was so bad that no-one has even suggested the possibility to try again.

rating after 3 plays - 7

its good fun but its just not much of a game - 3 games now and noones really got close to dying, discussion is minimal and is just a game of take that card playing to thwart other people - will try next time with the pl+1 monster damage and see if that helps

Cutthroat Caverns is a great game. It is easy to learn and assessable to a wide audience while maintaining the opportunity for decisive backstabbing with advanced players. The art work is beautiful, and there appears to be a lot of support from the community (I.e. from players submitting encounters and writing adventure modules). With so mush support and enthusiasm for this game from both the fans and Smirk and Dagger, I eagerly await the Fresh Meat expansion.

--Aug2008-- Strange "take that" game, in which one is largely cooperating with the colleagues that one occasionally backstabs.  It appears to require a fairly confrontational agenda right from the outset - rather than the fairly laissez-faire attitude we adopted early this time 'round.  I'd like to play again - though my rating could easily go down if things prove less interesting than I imagine.
--Feb2010-- I continue to be amused - but many of my friends won't touch it.

A very elaborate way of throwing a die, in essence. For all its quality cards, entertaining text, and charm, this is a "once I've been through the deck, why go through it again?" jaunt. I admit it can be entertaining at moments (we had a chain reaction round with 6 players where nearly everyone got surprised by someone else, and that happened more than once), but it outstays its welcome and has little to do with employing strategy or with working the cards. They majority of attack cards are weak or moderate, with few much larger and powerful attacks--and there is a decided dearth of specialty cards. I don't get the 7.x rating at all. Pretty (if a bit simplistic), but uninspired and tired.

While this game depends on a level of betrayal, this is not as backstabbing/take-that as Munchkin.  While you can directly interact with the other players at the table (CRITICAL MISS!) most of backstabbing is indirect (I poke the monster with a stick).  Whereas with Munchkin feelings have been hurt, thus far the same has not happened with Cutthroat Caverns.

"Take that" card game in the same vein as [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=213&Itemid=1]Bang![/url][/i] and [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=90&Itemid=1]Mag·Blast[/url][/i]. Nevertheless, it goes a step forward, cause this time is not only about killing your rivals, but to keep them near to fight for you and know the right time to backstap them. Players are going through a dungeon facing monsters and traps together, but only the player who gives the final slash take the points of the encounter. So, you are trying to get the other players to work for you, avoiding them to make the final hits while you are attempting to do so in order to have the most points at the end. The masterpiece of the genre, at least of the games of this kind that I've played.

This is the game Munchkin dreams of being. It does take about 2 hours to play, but you can shorten the number of encounters as desired. Very tactical and very 'thumb to the eye'. The diversity of monsters is great and this has a nice thematic feel to it.

Update: this game has some really unique design built onto the wire frame of playing cards in a programmed order. The design of the encounter cards in genuinely brilliant at times and really brings the theme out in a game with very little art/flavour. A success in design.

I am not the biggest fan of games filled with spite - especially when they are *heavily* luck driven and much too long. [b]Cutthroat Caverns[/b] is a perfect example of a game not for me, but that said it wasn't as frustratingly annoying as [b]Munchkin[/b] or other spiteful games. If the player count is kept low (i.e. 3-4 players) and the game was shortened (i.e. start at a later round and with less health for everyone) I might be willing to give it another go to mitigate the time.

Fantastic back-stabby fun.  Nice parody of all the time spent playing AD&D.  Too much chaos and unpredictability to take it  seriously but that's not the point.  You can line up the best move in the world then someone just plays a "Whoopsie! slip on a banana peel"-type card which screws you wonderfully.  Then of course you try to screw them.  All the time trying to steal the kill and subvert your teammates.  Nah, the lack of control is part of it and only adds to the hilarity.

This is the game that Munchkin and all other games of similar ilk are trying to be. Players use cards to defeat monsters in a dungeon. Though they work together, only the player who delivers the killing blow gains the prestige points. Expect lots of table talk, backstabbing and clever card play as players jockey to deliver the VP-awarding blow. The game is kept fresh by the variety of monsters and the variable initiative cards (which determine player turn order). Cards have funny flavour text and there is almost a Magic: The Gathering element to card combos as well as the special abilities of monsters.

Flaws? The several encounter awards too many bonus prestige points to the winner (+3 prestige for the 7th encounter for example) and could essentially determine the game winner.

An interesting mix of co-op play with a take-that mentality...keeping your opponents in the game until they aren't useful to you anymore.

A good game with co-operation mixed with screwage. Too much screwage and you'll lose. Not enough screwage and you'll lose. It's a balancing game of chaos and timing. The variety of encounters and moves available are good. The encounters have just as many tricks up their sleeves as the players do. This makes for an interesting gaming experience. Sometimes the game feels like it's a little longer than it should be, but that can easily be adjusted with the number of encounters. 

This game is what Killer Bunnies and Munchkin should have been.

Good, simple and easy to learn dungeon delver game. Everyone agreed that it was fun with the "working together but not working together" mechanic. The game can get a bit bogged down on some of the encounters (especially creatures that heal every round). The game's simplicity is also its greatest weakness. Without the expansions, the lack of variety from round to round can make latter encounters more of an exercise to get done than a new experience and we burned through the Player's items deck very fast (seeing "everything" the game had to offer early on). Despite that, it was fun to backstab a bit and try and come out on top as each encounter drew to a close.

Feels a bit like Munchkin -- fight monsters, help/hurt each other -- but more streamlined; shouldn't last as long next time. The rules on some of the encounters and cards could be clearer, though!

--- Summary ---
9 encounter cards drawn randomly from deck; top one is face up, others revealed as you get to them. At the start of each encounter, players draw 7 cards -- mostly attacks (value 0-100), but also items (potions of healing, haste, etc.) and special action cards which you can play at any time (modify attack strength, cancel someone's attack, etc.). Each round of combat, initiative is randomly determined (numbered cards); players select an attack card simultaneously, then reveal in initiative order. Damage accrues to monster. The player dealing the killing blow takes the card (with VP marked) as a prize. If monster not killed after a round of attacks, it attacks back (hits specific players, usually according to initiative number). Repeat rounds till players or monster killed. In later encounters, there are bonus VP's for the kill. Players earn VP's mostly by dealing the killing blow, but also certain cards. After all encounters complete, the surviving player with the most VP wins.

RATING: 8
I fell in love with this game right away.  This is mostly because I'm a sucker for content and to be fair, my one game was played with a friend's copy that included all but one of the expansions, I believe.

The game is a basic dungeon crawl at its core, you face an encounter each of 9 rounds and try to defeat it using attacks, special abilities, and equipment without taking too much damage.  Whoever does the killing blow receives prestige and whoever has the most prestige by the end of the game wins.  That's where the cutthroat comes in...

Now, I've long been saying that "semi-cooperative" games simply don't work and none that I've played until now have but this one certainly does.  There can only be one winner or none.  The game always lasts the nine rounds so if you clear out your competition too early you're left fighting against the remaining encounters by yourself and have probably very little chance of survival the more rounds you have to do this.

I can see that this game could get irritating because of the elimination mechanic since if a player is knocked out early he would be left out of the remainder of the game.

If played with the right people (who don't take the backstabbing which is inherently part of this game too seriously) this can be great fun that isn't too complicated to teach, plays reasonably quickly, and is reasonably inexpensive to even acquire the entire collection (the base game and each expansion including the huge one are only around 20 bucks a piece!).

A decent game for up to six players.  So far I've played with three and five player.  Five was definitely a better game.  It seems that this might be one of those games that plays as well or nearly as well at max players as it does at four or five.  Will definitely play again.

An interesting idea for a game but it just doesn't work as well when you play the game.  When a person cooperates with you or works against you seems to be based largely on chance factors rather than any kind of long-term plan or negotiations.  That makes the game too random for my liking.

RATING: 3
[1 play]  Initial reaction rating.  I didn't like it and doubt I will play it again.  I played one very tedious long six player game of this.  It is a monster killing card game.  The whole goal is to deal the final killing blow to a given monster to get points.  So early on when the monster has a lot of HP and is not close to dying everyone dumps their weakest cards which is a slow and tedious finally whittle the monster down, then once it gets in striking range there is a flurry of high value combat cards and special cards, both to do extra damage or to deny someone else from having a turn or dealing any damage.  It is a game about "hoping" you get the sweet spot in the turn order where everyone has already burnt their special cards that deny you up and you have enough firepower to finish the monster off.  A terrible combination of luck, chaos, screwage on a medium theme.  It was suggested to us after playing by the host that the game plays quicker and better with fewer than six people, and that could be the case, although unless really begged by multiple people I doubt I will be giving it another shot.

Clever idea to be both competitive and cooperative in a game, but game is too long, the initiative turn order adds too much chaos, other aspects are random. Although the first game was fun, I can't see myself playing again.

[Smirk & Dagger Games 2007 edition] {Fantasy, beers&pretzels; fighting, simultaneous-action, utility-cards; optimal 5-6p}  Cutthroat Caverns is thematic adventure filler. It is one of the best beer & pretzels game in my collection! However, group dynamic is very important in this game (perhaps as important as Munchkin). It's fun and is full of player interaction. Mechanically, it is similar to "Spank the Monkey", in which every player can lose if they produced too many internal conflicts. Recommended for all fantasy fans.  The only problems are that it becomes too easy as time goes on and the game is a little bit too long for what it is (it would be great within 35 minutes).

The illustration is very nice.  The components are of high quality. Card stock is think and durable.  English barrier is VERY strong.

[Expansion] The expansion does add new element: variable player powers; however, it's quite expensive to acquire.  Besides, it seems to make the game even easier with the special power. I am waiting S&D releases a combined set of expansions (in future?).

Don't play this with friends that take defeat hard or that are poor sports about losing. It is very true to its name: Cutthroat! (Or maybe it's just us...)

It helps to have something for the "dead" to do while they are waiting for the rest of the party to finish up. It's what I like to play when life is too busy for a DnD campaign.

4 Plays 2-3-3-3 players

I got toasted by Warlock Sarten's unnatural ability to draw 4 out of every 5 Blue and Green cards at will, repeatedly. Iron skin, Amulets, Cancelled Attacks in abundance; this guy had it all. 

I can be excused for thinking that there were two Amulets in the deck. After all, there was one used by the 'Warlock' before the reshuffle and hey presto, another immediately after the reshuffle. Is there no end to this man's trickery :(

I've not been wasted this badly since those robbing 7 so and so's from Settlers set about me. Hmmmmmh. Vengeance will be mine, cards permitting!

UPDATE. There was a lot that we were playing wrong in the first game. Item cards should have been discarded after use and many of the encounters we were playing were misunderstood. Playtesting with two was a disaster (at least for me) in this game. Looking forward to many more plays.

Single (abandoned) 5-player game. We corrected a few rules as we went along, and we still suspect there may be others to correct. I like the idea of a ‘co-operative until backstabbed’ game, but this didn’t feel a big element during our play. Must try again.

A one-of-a-kind card game.  Cooperatively beat down a monster, then competitively fight for delivering the death-blow, all with a deck of cards that give you multiple options for dealing damage and preventing your opponents from delivering their victory damage.  The huge array of monsters, items, and events offered in the expansions add much repeat playablity to this gem.

Finally got to play this game and it's a lot of fun.  Very simple rules with some wonky timing issues.  It doesn't see to have quite as much back-stabbing as I had hopped, but there's just enough to make it interesting.

Decent take that game. Becomes a bit boring after a while, I have the feeling the game drags too long for what it gives.

Last night we had a supposedly epic finish by the eventual winner (with exactly 1 prestige point) grabbing the opportunity to have the two leaders meet an untimely death at the last two monsters. And it still felt 'meh'.

A wild and wooly game which mixes cooperative play with loads of back-stabbing. The monsters you're trying to kill are varied and often innovative, the card-art is generally terrific, and the table-talk this game elicits is a hoot. Not recommended for an overly serious or sensitive gaming group, but for players who enjoy a romp it doesn't get much better than this.

The encounters are the main event in CCs and they generally do not disappoint. To be sure, in the right group, the game can be a lot of fun; however, the spirit of the game is really spelled out in the title: "cutthroat." I've played a handful of games where the group approached and played the game as a strict co-op, and, for me, those games are just rraeaallllyy boring. So, if you're interested in this game, just be aware of the sort of group you'll be playing with and realize if you're not one for being ruthless when the opportunity arises, your experience with CCs may be a bit lackluster.

RATING: 5.5
An interesting idea of a semi co-operative fight against monsters, where you score only if you deliver the killing blow. 

Unfortunately, the game is far too long for what it should be. Ten rounds (though we actually ended up playing 11 as one of the monsters was stolen from a player and returned to the supply) takes 3 or 4 times as long as a game that this is random and chaotic should.

The game also commits a cardinal sin; in the attempt to keep all players involved up until the very end, the final monsters are worth so many points compared to the beginning few that the first 75% of the game becomes completely pointless.

Add to this the randomness of card draws (admittedly slightly mitigated by the chance to discard and redraw between encounters), the take-that card play and the completely random events (one of the players lost 9 of her 11 victory points as she was unable to kill a monster - frankly because the other 5 players had no interest in helping her) make this a shambles of a game, frankly.

It took over a year for me to finally be able to pay my game but the stars aligned and I got it to the table.

For what it is designed to be I have to say it is a good game.  It is good natured, back-stabbing fun.  There were some great moments as one person would think they landed to killing blow only to have someone deny them.  I would certainly play again.

Cutthroat Caverns is a community elaboration on blackjack that has people stacking value cards to do damage and vie for the killing blow on various creatures.  It was an ephemeral and mild experience buoyed by the pals with whom I played rather than the gameplay itself and it did not fire my imagination, excepting a couple of the monster configurations. Ultimately this is a numerical card game, and I've never been much interested in this type of diversion.

This was advertised to me as 'Munchkin, but good'.  I've only layed it once.  I understand what they meant, but personally I'm not sure it's good enough for me to want to seek out another game.  Its fun, I'd play it again with the right folks at the right time.  I do prefer it to munchkin.  But not really my cup of tea.   I'm trying to think what makes me feel that way.  The theme is good, the humour is good, I don't mind the inevitable back-stabbing, because it is integral in the humour of the game.  I think it is just becaue it seems to me at first play that it is a just too ramdom.  Maybe I'd enjoy it more if I played it again.

I really wanted to like this game -- A dungeon crawl with unique gameplay?  A simultaneous-choice negotiation and bluffing game in which too much backstabbing means that everyone loses?  It sounded perfect.

Unfortunately, the game is way too chaotic.  So many cards and monsters have special powers that it felt very random, and winning a round just meant that you happened to play at a time when everyone else had run out of "take that" cards.  In a single game, we ran into several timing issues and conflicts between cards that the experienced players didn't know how to resolve.  In the end, I went from last place to first by killing a monster with a lucky draw.  It wasn't very satisfying.

I would give this another chance, but only with fewer players (there were 5), and no expansions (I think we were using one, but I'm not sure).

Have you every wanted to go into a dungeon with a group of friends, kill a bunch of monsters, and then steal all the glory and loot for yourself with the kill shot? 

For me cutthroat Caverns fits into the same nitch as Epic Spell Wars (but not as good), but having more portable medium/light games that can be played socially is always a good thing. As with ESW I actually like that the characters are fluff, in fact, I think too much rulesiness would detract from the visceral quality. Great game to have around!

Cutthroat Caverns may cause some arguments between players, and that coupled with its theme will keep it from being played with some of my gaming groups. But with an adventure loving, easy-going group, this can be one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with a game. I like the fact that players are forced to be cooperative yet can stick the dagger into each other at the most inopportune moment. Shrieks of rage and shock and laughter mingle together in this game from Smirk and Dagger, their best work to date. I highly look forward to the multiple expansions promised, to see what new monsters and rules will be added. For me, one of the best games of 2007. See my review for more details...

Quite a good game to play with three, better (but considerably longer!) with six. Since the game is mostly about guessing what cards your opponents will be playing and having to make the most of the cards you get each encounter make the game feel quite random. Iniative (which determines when you take your turn and often who is going to be hit by the monster) is also purely determined by drawing cards. Finally, the way that action cards are used out-of-turn to affect each others attacks makes the game quite chaotic sometimes. Oh, and the quality of the encounters varies wildy (there are some really cool and also some really pointless ones). So what's there to like? It is funny and it has a really nice "dungeon crawl flavour". It offers a LOT of player interaction. And the manual of the second edition is much better than the first. Just make sure that all the cool encounters go into the encounter pile next time you play.

Got my first game in.  I'll have to admit I'm a bit disappointed.  The game was fun, everyone was having a pretty good time once we stopped making mistakes with when to play cards.  My disappointment stems from how much it does sort of remind me of Munchkin.

I was expecting a bit more strategy, setting yourself up for killing blows, it really feels much more random.  You're excited to have a winning combo in your hand, and you excitedly plop it down, and someone else plays a card that shuts it down, and then you try to counter their card, and someone else counters your counter.

Gets kind of silly.  I am looking forward to the choose-your-own-adventure books though.  I'll bring this out on occasion, but I didn't love it as much as I thought I would.

Currently own only the core game which, while fun, feels somewhat lacking. The concept is very cool, the monsters and trap rooms are well thought out, and the game is mechanically sound.

That said, our gaming group was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more variety in the core set. The characters feature no diverse mechanics, the magic items are few in number and our particular group was a bit disappointed with the fact that there's no art for any cards other than the characters and monsters. While that last bit didn't bother me personally, I guess some people do view that as a detractor.

All told, the game is worth looking into and our group has enjoyed it. Definitely looking into picking up some expansions to see how things go from there.

Great stab you in the back game. The only downside is the player elimination, but it shouldn't happen until later in the game. It's like what Munchkin should have been - a humourous dungeon crawl that actually ends on time.

Based on one play.  It was a decent game.  It has that "stick it to you" ness of a Munchkin or Killer Bunnies.  I'd play it again but not something I would buy or actively seek out.  It supports 5 players which is nice, and plays fairly quickly.

Awesome back-stabbing fun!  Seems to have a lot of replayability.  After 3 plays with the base game, and 1 play including the first expansion I am really looking forward to playing more.  The rest of the expansions will probably add a lot more to the game too.  There is a lot to look forward to.

RATING: 3
The real tragedy of this game is that it could have been something a bit more strategic than what it is.  The idea of a dungeon crawl with some take that cards is OK in principle, so long as there are ways to manage some of the chaos that comes along with those designs.  For the most part, there are, but there are a few cards in the game that totally ruin that management.  For one, there's the trap that forces the players to discard all their cards into a common pool, thus destroying any attempt at management to that point; for another, there's the frakking turn order, which is determined randomly, multiple times in the same round!  I might be able to forgive one big honkin' bit of randomness in the game, but adding the random initiative just ruins it for me.  It's impossible to plan any sort of turn without being able to have a better idea of what you can do the next turn.  It reminds me too much of "games" like I Drank What? and Pitchforks and Torches.  As it is, it's going to take a lot to convince me to play this one again.

"Without teamwork, you will never survive. Without betrayal, you’ll never win."
\13\\13\
Cutthroat Caverns is played over 9 rounds, each with a random encounter. Essentially a game of 'kill stealing'. Each round, any monster encountered will have a prestige value of 1 through 6. The player that successfully jockeys for position and lands the killing blow gets the prestige value for the encounter. Some encounters will not have a specific monster, such as a trap room for the heroes to pass through (and in this case, earning no prestige). The surviving player with the most prestige after the 9 encounters is the winner. If the players do not survive all 9 encounters, no one wins the game.

A unique combination of cooperative game play and opportunistic backstabbing.

RATING: 8
It's criminal that this game isn't more popular, especially considering the ridiculous level of sales attained by Munchkin, which shares the same premise of a dysfunctional team of hapless dungeon crawlers fighting monsters and stealing their loot, but does so with far inferior gameplay. 

In Cutthroat Caverns, everyone absolutely must work together, but only one player is allowed to win. This is achieved (with a knowing smirk) by only allowing the player that actually lands the deathblow to receive any reward for killing the monsters. Everyone else that contributes to the slaying has simply wasted their resources and walks away with nothing. This creates an environment of negotiation and back stabbing that far exceeds what you might expect from the game's fairly simple structure. It's not all about killing monsters either, which is nice. There are quite a few encounters that play out almost like unrelated mini-games, which helps to prevent Cutthroat Caverns from ever becoming monotonous. The only weak point in the game (thematically at least) is that the different adventurer roles play identically, with no special advantages from one to another. (This was added in a later expansion, so it's only an issue playing with the base game alone.) As long as your group can handle direct player interaction and withstand table-flip worthy betrayals, this game is one of the best.

RATING: 6
I like the concept of this game, but in practice it mostly fell flat. I thought the "instant" cards were well done, and there was quite a bit of variety to the monsters, but ultimately I thought the hands sort of played themselves and whoever was dealt the cards that were most useful in that particular situation would win. I know that last bit sounds like it could be said about any card game, but I generally like card games, and this just felt excessively random to me, especially for the length of play.

Munchkin killer for me. I find this game much more enjoyable to play as the humor comes from the player interaction. While it still suffers a bit from luck of cards drawn there is an increase of strategy in choosing how and when they played.

RATING: 7.5
A surprisingly fun game - this one wasn't on my radar screen at all.  I think it is the best fantasy card game I've ever played.  Enough backstabbing to be fun, enough structure to be playable.  I think it peaks at 4, however.  With 5, I think it gets a bit too long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like Cutthroat overall, even though I have a few minor gripes. I think the game can drag on a bit too long when using the recommended number of encounters (I suggest 6 or 7 encounters instead of 9+). I like the general "work together but help yourself more" dynamic but by the way certain cards play out, it can easily fall into "king-maker" scenarios. There can also be a bit of a run-away leader sometimes.

But the game isn't meant to be taken seriously and (if you cut down the number of encounters) doesn't spoil this fun by overstaying its welcome.

For players who enjoyed Munchkin, I would suggest Cutthroat as a step-up from that. It has a similar sort of idea at its core but executed with a bit more finesse and more strategic options.

On the fence as to a 7 or 7.5. It's very long and involved, so it's certainly not a favorite, but I did have a great time on my first play and won which makes me like the game more. I enjoy that it's cooperative and competitive at the same time. The monsters are interesting and it can certainly be an edge-of-your-seats game. A lot of strategy involved, in my opinion, but the kind that is easy to master, at least for me. The artifacts are dumb, I never used them, but I like the game play and mechanics of having a card to choose from and not knowing what others will play, of turn order changing and who gets the prestige points, of how to lose energy and whatnot. A very good game, but too intense for it to be a favorite, I suppose. Still, enjoyable and great.

This game is awesome. It's has the feeling of playing a role game but the deepness of your character is based on your actions. Really love it to play all days if it where possible :D Excellent for 2 players. I think the best number would be 3 or 4 max. More delays the game too much.

This game is a hoot every time we play. A party of heros face the horrors of Cutthroat Caverns and need to overcome nine encounters (sometimes more) and get out alive. The catch is that only the killing blow grants valor witch leads to a whole lot of tripping, fainting, name calling etc. Very fun bash the leader style game.

Trust is a funny thing. Is that a knife behind your back, stuck in your back or will it be stuck into mine? This game is as if Dungeons and Dragons had a baby with Munchkin. It would look weird but you could not look away - and it would have superpowers (why not?). With the expansions tons of replayability and perhaps some upset feelings. Trust me.

Nice, fairly short card game where all players contribute attacks to kill the current monster, but only the player who lands the killing blow scores points.  The mechanics are much like Cosmic Encounter, where you have attack cards, cards that negate or alter other players cards (like Cosmic Zap cards), and special ability cards.  Very much a backstabbing game, where typical plays will negate another player's attack so you can deal the killing blow.

I really like this game.  Sometimes it a little random and confusing but it's exciting.  My biggest problem is with the timing of abilities and certain cards.  But it is a very flavorful game.

Update 05/07/08 - 8 to 6.  I feel I have no control in this game.  Anything I do may or may not have an effect.  The character abilities are imbalanced and the timing on cards gets in the way of play.  Rating may go up but I'll need to figure out a strategy first.

A 3-player game. Quite enjoyable. Though I and Marc were really, really put off by the fact that the last encounter get such an enormous amount of bonus prestige. It makes the other encounters way less significant. Whereas I and Marc had to beat 3 encounters to get 11/12 Points, Nils just killed the last monster and got a whoppin' 9 points, winning him the game (through luck, as he got the initiative #1 card, which is especially useful against the Minotaur). It really put us off, and we will probably screw the amount of bonus prestige down a bit.

You need the right people to play this game. When you do have that group, this game is a wonderfully backstabbing adventure!

There is a ton of player interaction and it really does force you to sorta work together, but at the same time you need to mess with your companions to win.  Its even possible for the game to end without anyone left alive.

I went into Cutthroat Caverns expecting death and mayhem, but what we got instead was a fairly casual stroll through the dark corridors.  It's true that a few of us came close to perishing, but there were enough potions to go around which allowed everyone to live to see another day.  I do like the concept of cooperation with the need to remain competitive to stay ahead, but the execution felt really rough around the edges.  For starter the availability of action cards seemed somewhat lacking, especially since the crux of the game is the ability to screw with other player's choices, as a result many rounds go by with nothing interesting happening simply because no one held anything besides attack cards in hand.  This then further contributed to the problem that the encounters sometimes last a bit too long than we would've preferred, it was definitely fun when a flurry of action cards were played and then resolved with unexpected outcome, but when all we do was shuffling and redealing initiative and revealing attack cards, the whole process became a drag.

In the end I appreciate Cutthroat Caverns for its novel concept, but there just does not seem to be enough of the "take that" gameplay to make it stand out.  Maybe future expansions can spice it up a bit and remove the repetitiveness, but for the moment I doubt we'll be going back for another adventure any time soon.

Fun coop take that game with a twist. You're all adventurers facing big baddies. You cannot defeat them alone so you need the others, but only he/she who strikes the killing blow gets the fame. So you try to manipulate and backstab others to that end, but backstab too much and you're all going to die in a horrible dungeoncrawly way and only fame goes to the that Hate, Spite or whatever the evil otherworldly thing was named that scewered you all in it's appendices.

Extreme backstabbing will happen in this game and with the right group of people it will be a blast. 

This game has been a hit in my gaming group. You can see the grin on everyone's faces when they come up with a plan (and most of the time, those plans will just annoy someone and give absolutely nothing to them XD).

The monsters give enough variation for the different encounters to be different and fresh, although it can drag a bit if the group focuses more on the backstabbing than on actually killing the monster. 

It's a good game as long as people don't take anything that happens too personal.

A nice little game, though definitely for the right group.  Some actions you take can lead to some ill feelings, so best to look at it light heartedly  :)
It's a *little* long too, I think I'd prefer it if there were 5 or so encounters, especially as some recycle, but this isn't a huge complaint.

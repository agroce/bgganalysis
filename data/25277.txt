GAME: Richard III: The Wars of the Roses
RANK: 1182

RATING: 7
Not bad...quite a brain burner (dunno why people say its easier than HoTS for a gateway block game - it is NOT!).

Really need to play this a few more times to figure out the optimal placement strategy (and to learn those bloody shields!) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I actually find Richard III a little more interesting than HotS because of greater replay value (at least in my opinion). Battles are very bloody at times. Of course there is considerable amount of luck that involves dice rolling but there's also just enough strategy.

Another game using the [thing=3685][/thing] combat system.   The treachery rules are wonderfully devious (bwahahaha!)  This one is a lot more bloody than the others, since combat units have higher hit values and you cannot add strength to a block.  Short playing time (3 turns, 7 cards per turn) is a big plus.

The only downside I have seen is that it seems to be imbalanced is favor of the York side.  Maybe it's just me.  Plus, it's just not very thematic.  It feels like Hammer pasted on to another map.

RATING: 7.5
A great game! Great components, a very good map (and it's nice to see where I live on a wargame map) and easy to learn rules all come together to make a very playable and interesting simulation. The two mini-scenarios (available from http://www.columbiagames.com/resources/3171/R3-Scenarios.pdf) make great introductory and learning games. The card driven mechanic works well, as each player has to make some tough decisions (move, add new forces etc.) each turn whilst not knowing what their opponent will do. It's a different game from Kingmaker but, if you are a fan of thhat game, I think you should take a look at this too.

Before buying Richard III I did ask myself whether I needed yet another game in the Hammer of the Scots family.  There is much that is familiar in Richard, but yet again some quite minor tweaks have produced a game with a distinctive feel.

Most important of those tweaks is a victory condition that makes the game all about keeping your nobles alive while killing your opponent's or converting them to your cause.  The only value of territory is that your nobles need a home to go back to at the end of each seven-turn campaign.  While the noble count is close, this leads to an intriguing game of feints and jabs.  However, it's tough for a player who finds themself well down in nobles as they really have to push their luck to try and redress the balance. While their opponent has no incentive to do anything but create big stacks and defend. And combat favours the defender. 

On early acquaintance, I'd agree with those who say that the game favours the Yorkists somewhat. Their forces seem easier to concentrate and they start with 8 blocks on the map or in their pool that hit on 1-3, compared to the Lancastrians' 6. 

Richard's artwork is among Columbia's best, with the map particularly handsome.  There is, however, the usual problem of massed blocks obscuring important information.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
To win in this game you are ought to realize that you need nobles on your side. You can kill them in battle, but the better way is through treachery. If you don't realize that, you will find it difficult to win as the white Yorkist .

The treachery mechanic is a bit odd in my view. In only 1 out of 8 attempts Warwick will change sides.

Many events are a bit awkward and you can get locked up in areas that only borders on two other areas. It is a matter of taste but this game lacks a certain amount of elegancy to be outstanding. A missed opportunity on a very interesting topic.

Rose nobles are permanently eliminated, while others change sides infinitely.

The gamesystem hasn't been put to another level like Hammer of the Scots and Crusader Rex did. It occurs to me, that gamedesign was more driven by playing it in a limited amount of time instead of an elegant gamesystem. In the Columbia range this game is a weak one. It lacks the brilliant gamedesigns of [gameid=3685] or [gameid=37836].

At last I would like to say that I was hoping for the Shakespearian version of this event instead of the historical one, since his plays Henry VI and Richard III struck me and they are more fascinating than the historical event.

Our first Block Game, which prompted me to get two more.  The Young lad and I have really enjoyed this one, but the White team seems to win predominantly.... 

We are seeing a change in this - We didn't, at first, realize that MP's were applied to groups of blocks...this has made the game a bit easier to Red.

Nice light wargame, playable in 90 minutes. While the game is a bit lighter than I'd prefer, it's hard to argue against the playing time; nice to scratch the wargame itch when you don't have much time. Gives a good flavour of the war of the roses without bogging down in chrome. 

Combat seems to be quite deadly, which makes me wonder if the different nobles are balanced (some die permanently, others don't, and treachery can be hard to achieve).

Short and fun with lots of room for manouver.

High chaos and luck factors. The only real object of the game seems to be to corner and kill your opponents blocks. Also it seems unbalanced in favour of the Yorkists.

Block wargames are great for enticing a non-wargamer... and this one did its job wonderfully! The rules are quite simple, but the gameplay seems deep enough to grant many plays. The components are gorgeous: the map is thin but magnificent, and the blocks give a fetish pleasure! A great game!

I may actually enjoy this slightly better than Hammer of the Scots, although this historical event interests me less. Have not played either game enough though. I do prefer how the nobles switch sides here, with the units having a wider variety than in HotS. Some units are completely loyal, some are mercenaries, and others can potentially switch. I'd like to read up on the period.

First impressions leave me thinking this is an excellent GAME; how it will turn out as history will take further play and study.  The area map is likely among the best I have ever seen.  More to follow.

_________________________________

(August 2011) The problem with reading solid history books is that they can make or break a wargame.  As history, Richard III is a farce.  The "real" game is the one Jerry did not make, but I hope he is able to get solid support from a publisher and make the game that he should have made (see his wonderful designer notes). The game, as is, has only a map's thickness of real history behind it.  Even as a game, when one is willing to set history aside, is dull after a few plays.  The two extra scenarios are shameful add on's that add nothing to the enjoyment.  The map is still a wonder, but it only serves to demonstrate how bad everything else is.  It is time for Jerry to set his evident talents to the task of making something that is outside of Columbia's constraints.

A teachable and playable block wargame covering the War of the Roses that can be finished in three hours. My first game was a close contest that went to the end after three campaigns. The neat twist is the opportunity for brininging over opposing nobles into your factions. 

For two players and especially those new to block wargames, it's a real treat.

After the initial playing...

I am intrigued. Like most of the Columbia block games I have tried, I tend to think of this as a puzzle that needs to be solved rather than a simulation. A fluid (ie dynamic) puzzle. Nothing wrong with that! The experience left me wanting more and I have spent several hours afterward studying the rules, map, units, etc..

Quick playing as there are only three turns of 7 cards each. I would guess that this is a 1.5 hour game on average. Beautiful components. There are a few rule exceptions that you need to keep in mind. Interesting victory conditions (either kill the five enemy heirs else be the King at the end of the game) makes timing important.

RATING: 8
A pretty simple block game. I'm looking forward to playing it a few more to see what sort of strategies emerge. Right now I'm giving it an 8. That may be a smidge high. We'll see how it rates once the newish luster starts to wear.

After another play i think it will remain an 8. We didn't get some important rules right the first two time (rose nobles eliminated from game if killed and the Scots not being able to sail). Third game was a lot more nerve racking as a result.

RATING: 8
Excellent game! There's a lot going on, but in a really good way. I might consider bagging the blocks by scenario (If playing 1483, use just these blocks. If playing 1470, add these blocks to the 1483 set. If playing 1460, add the rest of the blocks.) Matt Thrower's alternative treachery rules sound like a great thing to try as well, but I would like to try them in addition to the standard treachery rules, not all by themselves.

OK, as anticipated, my initial impressions were a little unfair. Second time through was much more satisfying. Richard III really does score by being sharp and short, so that's nice. It's also - and this can throw you - somewhat different from other block games, in that it's more of a press-your-luck game than an operational game. Once you get behind you have to start taking risks, and so you need to figure out where and how to take them, and you really need to be aggressive even though the system is very hard on attackers, especially Lancastrian attackers. Once you get behind on points, superior tactics and strategy are not going to bring you back in; this is a game that punishes you a bit for being behind. You need to know when to throw the dice even if the odds don't look good.

I dunno. I think I'd like this one better if it weren't the 6th game using almost the identical core system, especially since the last two (Athens and Texas) weren't very good, and also since the theme feels a little shoehorned here. The system is just starting to feel a little tired to me.

So anyway. I enjoyed the second playing of Richard III, and it does make a virtue of brevity. It seems pretty solid, although as is traditional from Columbia these days, play-balance seems suspect (take the Yorkists if give the choice, I think). But the system just isn't grabbing me; the card play doesn't provide enough nuance, and the events tend to be flavorless and slightly lame. Although I can't say yet whether Hellenes is really any good, I'm glad we pried it away from Columbia and moved it to GMT, so we can at least get something different.
---
Extremely provisional rating. Some elements of the game I like; I like the fact that it's short and sharp, I like the historical flavor, I like the period, the treachery is clever although it's not clear to me it's ever much more than a long-shot that turns into a game-buster if you make it.

So, some positive impressions, but also some concerns. I'm a bit worried about balance. There is a big snowball effect at work here; I'm not sure that it's possible to come back once you get a little behind other than by just taking some big risks and hoping. Also, the Yorkists have some very powerful A-rated units, while the Lancastrians don't; the good Lancastrian units are also hard to marshal. The Lancastrians will get absolutely raked if they have to go over onto the offensive against the Burgundians. Lancaster cannot afford to get behind early, but I'm not sure they can avoid it as the early game has them very vulnerable. Regardless, there should be some less-stringent auto-victory conditions that kick in when the game is effectively over for one player, since it's basically a rich-get-richer game. Being the Pretender seems to be mostly a disadvantage, and that after you are already losing on all the other metrics.

I dunno. I enjoyed playing it, and look forward to giving it another try, and remain hopeful - Jerry Taylor has done good work, and one has to give him the benefit of the doubt on this - but after just one play have to admit I am more skeptical than optimistic. I think it's time to put the card system pioneered by Hammer of the Scots back in the drawer. It's really been done to death since then, without ever producing much better than decent results. Crusader Rex was good, Hammer was OK, but too many of the others (Liberty, Athens vs. Sparta, Texas Glory) have been dicey at best. Time to move forward. Most of Columbia's recent games have mainly left me thinking that  I'd rather be playing Wizard Kings.

RATING: 8
I'm not sure it works too well as history but it tries to get some history deployed within a strong game chassis.

I thought the way the estates of the nobles was handled was very effective, and the campaigns are a neat way of recognising how little fighting went on in these wars. The Treachery rule was also nice and effective without resulting in mass treachery every battle

So history-lite but a handsome example. It will not impede anyone new to the hobby or subject, though it may not satisy those who know their WOTR. Fortunately the former group is much bigger

I did find the map too dark and the different movement lines did not always register with my eyes.

The possibility of killer stacks seemed strong; so be very careful in play.

A very provisional six rating. Ultimately, this and Hammer of the Scots don't feel like wargames to me. That isn't a bad thing, but it does mean that they fall in a curious netherworld of euro-y dice-y abstracts. The whole package is quite fun, but I need to remember not to pull them off the shelf when I want a wargame. I like everything about HOTS bu the mid-board clog. And that has been significant in both my plays so far. Richard III really creates a lot of openness with sea moves and with the pop-out-of-nowhere forces, but the game waters down some of the interest of the traitorous nobles; I much preferred the nobles HOTS that are flipped if they winter in occupied territory. The role-to-flip mechanism in R3 is just too random. Do I give up rolling a bunch of attack dice for a 50/50 or 25/75 shot at turning someone? If I fail, I'm hosed.

Played once so far with my HOS opponent.  Much of the game was similar to HOS.  I didn't realize on the first play that the Bombard is A on the first round of combat.  First play ended with a smashing Yorkist victory after just 13 turns, as all of the Lancaster heirs were killed along with most of their stalwart noble houses.  Lesson learned, you have to protect your heirs.  The ability to charge individual units is devastating to heirs.

First long war game I've played. I made a couple of key tactical errors in this one. I realised too late that Lancaster relies very heavily on holding their initial board position to win the game. By giving up early board position after the first round (e.g. London) I essentially ruined my chances of winning, as it became clear that the York side had significantly stronger units on average (which makes sense because they start as the pretender in exile). So by equalising map position and going for quick kills (which didn't pay off) I gave the game away. Would play very differently next time. 

While I would be interested in playing again, I felt slightly disappointed with the longer war game format. The additional complexity and depth added in this format over other shorter block games (Commands and Colors for instance) doesn't seem worth the time investment to me. I also found the board quite difficult to interpret in a practical sense while playing(e.g shields on the map were difficult to identify relative to opponents). It is also clear to me that these types of war games aren't that big on aesthetics (cardboard map with little effort paid to the readability and usability of the map - zero points for components).

Une première partie sympathique mais qui montre que l'équilibre du jeu semble très fortement à l'avantage de la rose blanche...
Du coup les réflexes du côté Lancastre, lors des parties suivantes, risquent d'être très défensifs. Repli vers le nord et attente du gong de fin de la 3e campagne...Ce qui peut nuire à la rejouabilité de l'ensemble.
Il n'empèche, Richard III est un jeu plaisant pour une courte soirée...Mais la remarque restera t'elle valable sur plusieurs parties?

Unlike most of the other Columbia pre-modern games based on the Hammer of the Scots system, I didn't much like this one. Each of the "campaigns" (basically, hands of cards) tended to end in a big, static stalemate, with a long WWI-style line of stacks splitting the southern part of England in half. Sometimes there would be a big battle at the end of the campaign or end of the game, sometimes not--it depended on how desperate the potential attacker was.  This dynamic was encouraged by the victory conditions, which rewarded picking off individual nobles (they were all roughly equally important) to get a better claim on the crown. There wasn't much reward for controlling territory, except that it gains you control of the nobles from that area. So as a defensive strategy, there was a big advantage in simply forming bigger stacks to protect your nobles, and parking them on the nobles' home areas. Because there's a "reset" at the end of each campaign where everybody goes home, you get this pattern repeated 3 times. Unlike in HotS, which also has a periodic "reset", nobody has an option to stay on campaign.

There are probably offensive strategies to counter the static defenses we had settled into, but after 2 games like this, I lost interest, crossed R3 off my might-buy list, and moved onto other things.

Definitely a radical departure from AH's [i]Kingmaker[/i]. The combat mechanics intertwined with the treachery aspect definitely keeps the game interesting. The open map and nobles bouncing around at the end of each turn prevents bottlenecks and predictable unit movement and placement, something [i]Hammer of the Scots[/i] sorely lacks. Also, the game is short, which is a bonus.

There are a couple issues that prevent me from giving it a higher rating. First, as an old [i]Kingmaker[/i] grognard, I miss the multi-player wheeling and dealing. Also, I didn't find the events terribly interesting. Some were useless, like Piracy, and others only marginally useful. In some cases they could downright backfire. I'm also not sure about play balance.

But, on the whole, a pretty decent block game that I'm happy to play from time to time.

Players represent the Yorkist or Lancastrian faction, fighting out the Wars of the Roses in 15th century England.  Players simultaneously play an action card which determines play order and the amount of actions they get on their turn.  Actions are spent on activating areas of England and moving units around, possibly attacking.  The aim is to control a majority of nobles in England at the end of the "campaign" (i.e. 7 turns), which means you either retain or usurp the throne.  The game is played over three campaigns, with the King at the end the winner.  There are auto victory conditions - if you bump off the five heirs of the opposing house, you win instantly.  Very interesting game, definitely feels like part of the modern Columbia Games line, with the game's theme pressed into the Columbia format (8 pages of rules, the standard combat rules, card play, etc).  However, the dynamic and complex nature of the Wars of the Roses is retained via some simple, and clever rules.  Having three campaigns over the 30 year period is well thought out, as there was a lot of inactivity during that period as well.  I also like the treachery rules, where some blocks will swing from faction to faction, but tend to be a bit more sticky to one side via the different loyalty ratings for each faction's version of the same block.  Enjoying this one.  The only downer is the map - looks lovely but very dark and difficult to play on... part of the growing trend of modern game maps... pity.

I'll leave this game on an 8 despite the fact that i feel as though i've played it out after about a dozen games. I've enjoyed getting there with it. For the Lancaster side there appears to be one serious strategic solution. The distribution of cards, and Yorkist moves may force you to adapt a little tactically but your essentially going to be doing something similar each game. Yorkist remains very varied but your the antagonist so you choose which direction to invade from.

In short, a good game, historically viable if not precise. Balanced around the first campaign. So if one player comes out of round one badly they will struggle to catch up later. It is rather asymetrical. Uses the standard columbia system with some appropriate chrome.

We played Richard III and had an absolute blast!  It may very well become my favorite Columbia block game.

R3 plays in under 3 hours (probably more like 2.5 hours) and seems pretty well balanced to me.  Much more so than either Hammer or Crusader.  No siege in the game, which I like.

Watch out for bad card draws. I might adjust the mulligan number to 15 AP.

Good game with interesting decisions to be made; nice blend of luck and skill.  Accurately simulates "fog of war," with misdirection and bluffing possible.  Quality unit blocks a pleasure to play with; too bad the board's unmounted and the box is a bit cheesy.  

BGG estimate of 120 minutes playing time probably 1/2 your actual playing time.

Very compact game - three hours top! - but having the flavour of the Wars of the Roses. Treachery, death of heirs, the works. Battles come fast and furious. The new combat rules makes combat more exciting, with the possibility of death of the heirs at a more heightened level. 

Admittedly, the new combat rules makes combat a more high-stakes affair and dice will be dice. But the advantage of the shorter duration means you can play again within one afternoon.

Arguably the best introductory block war game.  Two player game, as the house of Lancaster takes on the house of York in a quest for the kingship in the Wars of the Roses.  Built on the successful HotS engine, but quicker, easier, and with a different theme and some different mechanics.   Really enjoyed learning and playing this, pictorial session report [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/463779]here[/url].  Pictorial illustration of gameplay [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/465949]here[/url].
The beauty of this game is that it can serve as common ground for a range of tastes: it's within the reach of euro gamers, and yet there's enough meat for fans of block war games to savour. Its appeal could even exceed the success seen by its cousin, Hammer of the Scots. A well researched and integrated theme, quality components, and fun gameplay.

[4 plays] Just an awesome game in a fairly short play time and simple rules for a war game.  The heirs and treachery really make the game seem like it could develop a lot of different ways.  The game feels nicely asymmetric, but not too much so.  It feels like either side could be on offense at any particular time, though the burden of attack is usually on the Yorkists.  The heir charges are especially fun when eliminating your opponent's heirs.  It also feels nicely dynamic and decisive.  Many block games feel like a war of attrition, but not so in Richard with blocks with a rating of B4.  It's nice to be invested in each piece; losing a block can be devastating because your forces come back at full strength for the next campaign and it's nice if they can survive to fight another day.  By far the best looking game columbia has put out.  It is nice to see them stepping up in the graphics department.  

My major issue with this game being that the second and third eras devolve into a very predictable game of bluff with Lancaster hunkering down in a few cities and York making a gamble on which city doesn't have the heavy hitters in it which greatly diminishes my interest.  The first era is terrific, however, and probably my favorite experience from Columbia Games.

RATING: 7
Block wargame featuring conflict between York and Lancaster dynasties in 15th century. 

Easy rules, dynamic play, campaign lasts 3 hours and scenarios are not interesting. A good option to start in block wargames. 

Nice map and block stickers. 

It's more difficult to win as Lancaster since its blocks are less powerful than York's, so that side must be played more carefully.

Richard III is a variation of Hammer of the Scots. RIII is easier and faster to play than HotS.  So far we've had no issues with the rules.  

Other than learing how to best use each side, the biggest curve is learning the map.

A player-aid that cross references family shields, names, and map locations would be helpful.

Give the Yorkies to the less experienced player.  They seem to have more obvious advantages; 2 blocks that can make treason roles, higher loyalty rated blocks, London is their city, better mercenaries in terms battle ratings and flexibility of placement, and the heirs are stronger blocks than their counterparts.

Lancaster needs to be much more position aware. They need to know key areas to hold for themselves and those areas to hold to prevent York nobles being recruited. Lancasters have smaller margin for error.

A low activation hand for Lancaster in 1st turn likely spells big trouble for them.   Definitely run for the north (good advice for 1st turn with any hand really)

This is one of Columbia's simpler games and it has lots of flavor including treachery, foreign mercenaries, and dramatic charges. So far though I'd say something is a bit missing in this one. Maybe the game strikes me as too short and it does lack rules for leader death not involving battle (Edward IV died of sickness not in battle). Regardless of all this it is a tight game and a decent simulation.

UPDATE: Further plays show a great imbalance in favor of York. Simply form a killer group of blocks, hunt around for Lancasters, rinse and repeat.

RATING: 7.5
Components: good blocks, the cards and board could be better (standard Columbia)
Complex: not difficult for these kind of games
Weight: medium
Players: 2
Length: 2 hours more or less
Mechanics: area control, dice rolling....
Decisions: good for the game, which card to play, who to recruit, where to move...
Opinion: I like Columbia games, although there is something there that doesn't shine for me, however I don't know what it is exactly.
The game is about the war of the roses, [s]Lannister against Stark[/s] Lancaster versus York, played over 3 campaigns of 7 turns each.
Decide what card to play, and this will dictate who will be first and how many points you will have in your turn.
In your turn you can recruit Nobles or move them along England, the goal is to have majority of Nobles on the board at the end of the 3rd Campaign, or kill the heir of your opponent.
If some of regions ends the turn with block from both players, there's a battle (standard Columbia, each block has a letter to show when to act, and the number to hit). And repeat turns until the 7th, at this point you count your votes (your Nobles on England) and the one with the majority is the current King, this will say who is the winner on the last campaign, on the first and the second this will say which one is the Pretender, who will start in exile.
After the king is determined, each Noble goes home (you know, some time to relax), unless his home is occupied, then... out until recruited again.
Well, as already explained could seem to be boring, no, not at all, the game is funny, fast and very dynamic, the turns are not long and the decisions are tough. Battles are easy to solve and the end of each Campaign is done fast. I really enjoyed it, more than Hammer of the Scotts, but, as said, there is something with these Columbia games making them not shining for me, I really enjoy playing them, would play them whenever I have the chance, but they don't sine

RATING: 8
First play was interesting and close at the end.  Play time after some experence (2 or 3 plays) should easily come in under 2 hours.

Similar in some respects to Hammer of the Scots, but several key differences exist, such as no retreat in the first round of combat, units do not rebuild, dual event cards do not result in an end to the "campaign," and action points from cards are used to recruit, land move and/or sea move.  Throw in supply and stacking changes and you have a game that uses the base Columbia block system in a very different way.

Lots of good decision points along the way.  Recruit?  Trap and pick off nobles?  Skip a fire round and attempt to entice treachery?  Great gaming!

An excellent replacement for AH Kingmaker.  Unlike the AH game, the map is very useable and the game actually ends.

Compared to Hammer of the Scots, I think R3 will have more playability.  First, it is much shorter (21 card plays for each player, versus 45).  Second, there is more room to maneuver with a good variety of defensive bonuses.  Finally, the end-of-campaign reset of positions shakes up the board position.

update:  sold.  R3 just didn't give me that War of the Roses vibe.

RATING: 6
Okay: Strategic - War of the Roses - Easy

Plus:
-Outstanding production value: best components I have seen in a Columbia Game to date
-Streamlined design; wars of the roses is a very complex conflict and presenting it in such a playable fashion is design(er) is exceptional. 
-Good introductionary game for non wargamers
-Play time 

Minus:
-Although streamlined, I felt gameplay is bland as there is no chrome at all.
-Event cards are very weak and it is better to have heir cards on hand. 
-Two weak event cards can ruin your campaign completely if the other has some high number cards. A pitty and imo a missed opportuntiy not to further develop the Event Deck.
-Game play arguably unspectacular.
-I doubt wargamers like this game. 

For it's target audience this a good game / game design. 
(Target audience are Eurogamesr / Light Wargame players)
For the Wargamer there is not much here unfortunately. I I expected more and therefore I am maybe a bit disappointed.

Accessible, good play time, slick game play it is all here. However,  It feels like Richard is lacking somthing. IMO it is a bit too simple;it is lacking some twists and turns like 'HotS'. Great production value, balanced, all works fine but rather unspectaculair. Imo they could have left the event cards completely.

Revisited, I tried again and again but it is not interesting for me; too 'simple' and missing something.

Traded away.

Bought February 2010. Played this a couple of times prior to buying. Wasn't too sure about it at first but I really love Kingmaker and block games too; therefore looked like this one should be a sure bet. Have played it since and I do like it although in the games I have played there have been moments when I thought the game is unbalanced and a little lame. However, happy to play more games of it to see how the different strategies develop over time and with different opponents. Just love the production values of this game!

I found the map abysmally hard to read. It made setup tedious and it was just very difficult for either of us to process the information on it. It may look good when you're not playing but during actual play it felt like it impacted playability significantly.

Once the Pretenders gain the upper hand it felt like it was impossible to reverse their fortunes. They have better troops and then get all the Kingly bonuses, too. Granted, that's only based on a single play so don't read too much into that. I like the shorter playing time than Hammer of the Scots but the map is the real deal breaker for me.

Probably my favourite of the Columbia block games to date, as the system is now mature enough to cut down the luck factor (no random reinforcements as in HotS, and cards can be redealt if you've a really bad hand) while keeping the play time reasonably short. I do worry that the Yorkists (white) may have too easy a time of it as their mercenaries are very powerful and the Lancastrians have no equivalent units, but reasonable historical flavour.

Played 5 times. With Richard III, Jerry Taylor has again created a very thematic game by making subtle changes to a tried and tested basic system. Richard III is more akin to Hammer of the Scots than to Crusader Rex, but improves on HoTS in terms of player control over recruitment, and greater breadth of movement options due to the sea movement rules and extensive coastline. However, with the current ruleset the game favours the Yorkists - I really think it needs a tweak to balance the sides. In our fourth game we gave the Lancastrians a free 2AP recruitment during set up, and they came very close to winning. For the fifth game we gave the Lancastrians one of the nobles from the Yorkist pool to set up on the map, and they claimed a decisive victory.

Good light wargame.

It has some issues:
- balance - it can happen one side gets much more powerful cards than the other.  And mullligan in the form descibed in the rules won't help.
- events - too weak/situational.  You almost feel punished without a reason after getting several of them into your hand.
- several fiddly rules providing chrome/historical flavour.  I don't mind them at all if they are used often enough during a gameplay.  Here they are almost never used...
- rulebook - TRAGIC.  _Full_ of gaps and understatements.  Even some fundamental issues (e.g. what happens after the battle with the unit which betrayed) are not described!  No proofreading from players not knowing the game at all...
- execution.  Poor quality map.  Box prone to destruction (as usual in Columbia games).  Cards look like cheap home-made imitations.

BUT overally the impression is _positive_ and the gameplay is most of the time fun and exciting - and that's what really counts.
Some mechanisms implemented are really great.

---

Still - I've got no desire to possess the game (so far; it might change with further plays), because in the wargame genre I prefer more complicated designs.  And also - possibly the playing time is a bit too long for the level of complexity in this case.  Yeah, I know - it should reasonably short with subsequent plays, but I still feel it might be too long for my taste.

One play only

Columbia block game based on Hammer of the Scots system but with a Wars of the Roses theme.

Like Hammer asymmetrical game requires different strategies of the two players. The game may if anything be less forgiving than Hammer. This is because many nobles are permanently removed from the game once killed in battle, in itself a situation more likely to occur than in Hammer as all hits from one piece are applied against a single enemy piece rather than spread evenly as per the earlier game.

Interesting conflict between the need to bring the vulnerable nobles into play for the end of season kingship-voting versus using the expendable levies and bombards which count for nothing in the kingship vote.

You need to plan for the end of season board resetting, as isolated nobles are easy prey at the start of each year before forces consolidate.

Our 3rd fog-o-war/block game from Columbia Games.  

EndersGame's review " So you're wondering..." is a plethora of gaming and background information and a MUST read for anyone interested in this game.  If you're not all that familiar with the CG block/attribute style of game, I would strongly suggest that your initial scenario attempt be the d/l single-campaign 'Richard III 1483', thennn... take a chance/challenge with the lopsided (strongly in favor of York) scenario 'Kingmaker 1470'.  Afterwords settle in with the much longer three campaign scenario included in the rulebook.   

I like the subtle chance of treason in the Treachery Rolls with regard to a (non-rose) noble's Loyalty Ratings, adds a simulated sense of intrigue and reality.

Attractive light wargame that shares many features of Hammer of the Scots--for example, movement and combat are a breeze if you're familiar with Jerry Taylor's games. This would nicely fill the niche of an approximately 2 hour game once you've played a couple times, I think. 

Many more blocks can permanently die, as opposed to the "Whack-A-Mole" feeling of Hammer when you have the Scots on the ropes but they hang on and rebuild themselves over the winter period. Part of that is probably from the inability to flee from combat until a full round is complete.

The treachery ability is a neat twist, although I'd be very hesitant to try it on anyone other than a noble that requires a single die roll attempt (the odds on the two-dice and three-dice nobles are much longer, to be used when you're in really dire straits I guess).

I'm not sure I get it, even after 9 plays.  Our games seem to come down to the last few battles, and that's exciting.  But there's so much going on, and I'm not sure I'm doing the forward planning necessary as yet.  I think I'm playing tactics b/c I don't fully understand the inner workings of which block belongs where and how the pieces fit together.  

It'd be swell if I had a playing partner that wanted to get deep into it.  As is, it's an interesting enough distraction.

Seems too random for my tastes - cards, treachery, combats. But if you look at my profile I do enjoy lot of games with high chaos in them just use of randomness in this one does not suit me.. I do not like fact that cards are only one purpose. 

If I am going to play CDG driven block game I would prefer everytime Prussia Defiant Stand or Hellenes: Peloponesian War.

If going to play something thematic and hell random I would prefer Warriors of God.

So in conclusion I cannot see any reason why to play again. And just add fact, that production values are except for blocks quite sub-par.

 I like the fact that you can easily move your forces around the map.  It makes for multiple area of battle.  In comparison, Hammer of The Scotts almost always has a "front line" in the middle of the map, not so here, so it really has a different feel.

After a couple of plays, I am lowering my score, simply because I found I prefer playing HoTS or Crusader Rex instead.

A very simple but fun block game which provides good campaign feel, but it has one signigicant design failure:

At the moment I like it a bit more than Hammer of the Scots. Richard III is strategically more open to different approaches and plays quite a bit quicker. Far abstracted but does what it's set out to pretty good. Feels nicely balanced so far, except the Lancasters can have a hard time if they fail defending their initial positions - good luck going on offence against the "York/March with their French cronies" -powerhouse, especially with any defensive bonuses.

RATING: 8
Emblems!  More emblems.  Nice box cover and the map is superb.  

Five games under my belt and I am still immersed in it.  

Some rules to remember: Bombardment unit is an A unit during firing on the first round - they are set up and ready to fire! Some units with a noble shield of red cross are Bishop units and they are recruited at Bishop cities like Cantebury and York. After winning the battle, the winning side can regroup to cut the subsequent evasive maneuver by the defeated. Always look out on units defending on home turf! They perform one rating higher up in firepower in battling the enemy. Some units can betray and turn to the other side during battle, if you can roll evens on the no. of dice as indicated on the upper left of the noble block.

Instead of going through the rules in details as they were covered in a lot of reviews already, I am going to discuss some of the more interesting game concepts or gameplay in Richard III. The regrouping rules are the illustrative example of what could have been clearly worded in order to avoid ambiguities as such. I am also bothered by the rules every time my group is victorious. Only after re-reading the rules several times can I deduce the intention of the designer with the word "areas", plural form of a noun, which implies that there can be more than one area that the victorious units can regroup to. A simple example of play can clear up the ambiguities but the latest version 1.2 rules back in 2009 didn't cover this still and there is no newer version. The FAQ didn't address my concern either. My opponent and I play the game with educated guess that they can be regrouped to different areas, even leaving some behind in the original battle area. But I am not 100% sure if we play it right. Assuming the border limits are not exceeded during regroup, theoretically then the regroup can corner-in an area, to which the losing side units retreated, from three sides. I am not sure if it feels right for medieval command like the Panzergrendiers do during WWII.

The idea of Usurpation is nice but its execution is quite mathematically-laden as the players have to calculate the number of controlled nobles and heirs, churches and the city of London. The blocks in Isle of Man, in exile or in the force pool are excluded. A switch of the role of "King" and "Pretender" occurs when there is change in the majority. The former King is deposed and must go into exile, with his heirs, as the Pretender now. The burden to attack, therefore, falls on the House of York as they are the Pretender in the beginning.

Overall, a great block game. There are many nice little rules that cook up the whole thing graciously.  It's a game that is easy to get a hang-on after you get it to play one or two times.  You use action points on the cards (events always take place first) to recruit and to move.  Like history, the game is a bloody thing in which stacks of blocks (4 maximum for supply check at the end of turn, 5 in an area with city) and eastern-front-army-movement-like concentration and dispersal tightly packed in 3 turns of 7 cards. Instant victory is achieved when all five enemy heirs are eliminated and so a lot of fox chase actions on the map. All blocks go home (mercenaries are released) and are reset to full strength for another bloody campaign season. Then the bloody stuff happens again all over again!

The fog of war adds to the tension, as does the strategy in choosing when to play those special action cards (sometimes useful, sometimes useless!)

The learning curve may put some people off - and it's not lightweight. But with 2 players playing well, it's a great, bloody, strategic, block wargame.

The Avalon Hill classic Kingmaker has long been one of my favorite games I've recently played Richard III, and this contender is giving the classic a run for it's money.

The game mechanics are cleaner than in Kingmaker, and Kingmaker was not designed as a two player game, and generally would be unbalanced as a two player game.

RATING: 8
My rating is after one play(with some rules fumbling), so it's a provisional rating (could go up or down). I have a sneaking suspicion that I am going to like this slightly more than Hammer of the Scots. It seems a bit more balanced and accessible. I love the treachery rules. The game definitely needs further plays and exploration. Overall my feelings are pretty positive.

When I 1st got this pre-order in the mail I was worried that Columbia Games had dumbed down Jerry Taylor's game into another version of the Hammer/Liberty/Crusader Rex games. To some extent that is what they did. There is very little in this game that anyone who has played any of the above games will not know. 

That being said, I have to say this is one of the bunch that I enjoy. I think this games feels most similar to Hammer, and IMHO is a better game. It plays considerably quicker than hammer, is less quirky and even looks better. I would think this is the introductory block game of choice from here on out. 

Still not as good as Crusader, but the play time may mean it gets to the table more than that game. 

If you like block games then this is worth having. If you are interested in trying one out than this is probably the best choice.

Did not grap me yet. One major downside is the map quality. The cardboard is not heavy enough to lay down flat. This is a major drawback for me. 

Consider me disappointed. Nevertheless I still hold on to this game.


Update: I let go of it.

If you like Hammer of the Scots, you'll like this. Essentially they're the same game with some 'shifts' and a couple of additions like having heirs and a political vote based on nobles.

Overall, very solid game that I believe is slightly superior to HotS.

RATING: 8
This is the first block wargame I played. The rules are well organized and quite easy to learn, so I can recommend this to anyone looking for a simple block wargame. Once players are familiar with the rules, the game can be set up quickly and played in a couple of hours. 

I have mixed feelings about the theme in this game. I have read a bit of wars of the roses, so I understand what the designers were trying to convey with some of the rules. However for someone who is not familiar with Lancasters, Yorks and their relationship, the rulebook and gameplay do not offer much historical flavour. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
As a block game, it's ok - easy to learn, quick to play, but not that compelling. 

As a game about particular events in history, it's a failure - there is nothing here at all that evokes the Wars of the Roses. It's more or less a vanilla block game with period appropriate graphics. The early Columbia games were so brilliant at capturing some interesting aspect of the conflicts they modelled and making it central to the game - sadly, not the case with Richard III.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
3 / 5 - Good.

My initial impressions of this are favourable. Comparisons with Hammer of the Scots are inevitable, and on the whole Richard III is better. It's more open and fluid and makes better use of the fog-of-war effect inherent in the block system. However it can still be annoyingly capricious for a relatively long game, even though the balance is better because both sides have a variety of block initiative and strength combinations. Beware if you're a fan of low-luck games. The shorter scenarios help with this but of course the main scenario with it's long term strategy considerations is the main draw.See my review for more details: http://fortressat.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1620&Itemid=0

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
After one play, the complexity became apparent - key areas to grab and hold to both bolster you position and stuff the opponent; the virtue in using some weaker nobles to block others form returning to their home districts; the values in different types of units; the need to isolate and pick off smaller armies; using meat shields to protect weaker noble units; deliberately taking hits on valuable units so that they wouldn't easily be targeted again in the same battle.

I enjoyed it first play, and a great way to learn a bit about English history, but the initial rules explanation (leaning from the book) took an hour.  Keen to play again. Rated 7.5 initially, may go higher.  Would really benefit form some decent player aids listing the blocks and spawn points for each side.

12/03/09 Obtained. Early February 2010: played a least a dozen games solitaire, including the two scenarios (1470 & 1483) from the Columbia Games site. 02/27/10 Played a full game with an opponent. Richard III has all the good points of Hammer of the Scots, coupled with a shorter playing time (21 turns as opposed to 45). The full game is great. But I'm not sure the scenarios are balanced. Yet since they aren't really part of "what comes in the box" I don't let them detract from the game's rating. 
As of 05/08/16 I've played nine full games (against others), winning six. Average play time is three hours.

Tight balancing game with blocks on a map. See how I avoid the word 'wargame'? While there's certainly a few direct confrontations, it's more about maneuvering, protecting your nobles, recruiting grounds and bringing in your important pieces as fast as you can, while trying to block your opponent to do the same. It's not about large armies, but quick precision strikes to gain that one point lead, and all this in 21 extremely tense rounds.

RATING: 7
Play cards to move your forces, roll combat dice and recruit most nobles to be the King of England.

Plays: More than a dozen.
Type: Wargame = a game where you move military forces on a map to destroy other military forces and/or conquer territory. Blocks and area movement style. Strategic scale.
Complexity: Light wargame.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 120-180 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for limited resources – nobles. Conflict.
Randomness: High – card draw and dice.

Replayability: High. One of the quickest wargames I know, still delivering that wargame feel. Gameplay flows smoothly, has interesting decisions and rules are very intuitive.
Fun: This is lots of fun. The decision making is exciting. I’m a big fan of simultaneous order selection. Rolling lots of dice in battles is fun. Lots of "Win or lose" moments.
Memorability: High. This creates a story about the War of the Roses. You will definitely remember when your treacherous nobles suddenly switch sides and turn the tables completely.

Thematic integration: Great! You feel just like an English 15-century monarch, manipulating "loyal" nobles to join your side and sacrificing freshly hired mercenaries in hopeless battles.
Components: Good. The board, blocks and heraldry all make for a good looking game. It looks fun to play when you set it up. My stickers came a bit blurry, but that is no big complaint.

Who will like this: Wargamers that want to entice strategy gamers (or even spouses) to dabble in wargaming and wargamers that want a quicker game.

RATING: 8
Richard III: The War of the Roses works really well. It is a visual fest and although relatively simple, is rather chess-like in that your decisions as to movement to consolidate your forces to bring battle is so key. The Yorkist player starts with a heck of a dilemma as his forces need to invade, but where? And then you need to get sufficient forces into Britain to stand a chance. The Lancastrian player is spread all over Britain and will struggle to collect his forces. Fantastic, tense, frustrating. Yes, combat is subject to die rolls and this can be frustrating if the dice go against you. I like the luck and uncertainty of using dice. As had been said, luck plays an important part in warfare.

Also the Battles are brutal as you decide how long to keep up the fight, especially as the attacker because its tough to beat down the defenders. You can’t rebuild units except between campaigns. Yet both players must attack at the right time. The Lancastrian player has an advantage of starting with the King so can play a bit more cagey as the Yorkist needs to be more aggressive.

It just is a pleasure to play. Little downtime once you are comfortable with the rules. Plays fast, is fun, tense all the way until the end. The Block system adds the fog of war so you are always a bit wary about what you are up against.

Overall, Richard III: The War of the Roses is a lot of fun and a great way to have a war game experience in a short space of time. You aren’t going to get a detailed simulation here. The feel is strategic in giving the grand scope of the fighting for who would rule England. This is ultimately a game for casual war gamers who want a fun experience in a limited amount of time which is right up my street. Awesome.Does it feel historically accurate? Well there’s enough for me as I’m more interested in the play with enough to give me a sense of what went on without having to get a headache. I guess as my interest is now piqued to read more about the War of the Roses, its a job well done!

RATING: 6.8
This Columbia games block wargame seems pretty similar to Hammer of the Scots, but with a bit more thematic chrome around dynastic loyalty and treachery (based heavily around Richard Neville aka Warwick the Kingmaker) and suchlike. The components are very nice and work well and I must say I like the theme.

The object of the game is to make your ‘house’ (York or Lancaster) the winning house by having one of your heirs on the throne at the end of the game or liquidating the five enemy heirs. At the start of the game the map is dominated by the Lancastrian armies under the feeble Henry VI. The Yorkist forces start in exile either in Calais or Ireland. The game plays cleanly and is quite good fun. I have only played once so far and can see there is a fair bit of strategic depth in this package.

The gameplay is probably, in all honesty, a bit too similar to Hammer of the Scots to justify owning both (as it happens, I own neither – both copies belong to my regular wargames opponent) but worth considering if you’re looking for a low unit density medieval era block wargame. I’ll play again if the chance arises but would only purchase if it was a really good price.

Not to be confused with Kingmaker or Wars of the Roses: Lancaster vs. York (which deal with the same topic), this is a block wargame version of the War of the Roses.  It is similar to Hammer of the Scots as Colombia offers go, but does give the feel of moving nobles/lords over the England landscape to capture/defend the throne.

Rating after one play.  It was very fun.  While clearly a more fluid and shorter game than Hammer of the Scots, it also feels less polished... but maybe that was intended.

RATING: 8
Richard III is a block game that has core mechanics in common with Crusader Rex. It is a light wargame but it has a lot of room for strategy and tactics. Moving is interesting and fights are bloody. I really like the fact that one has to protect his nobles. Therefore players have a good reason to retreat when combats are not going well for them. Avoiding combats is also important. There are few details that give this wargame a lot of flavour. For one thing nobles switching sides is an idea I like a lot.

I had this game preorder and when I finally got it I was a bit disappointed because I had been looking for a meatier block game (something like Rommel in the Desert and EastFront II). However, I like this game. It is light, it is fast and it is a lot of fun. So if you are looking for a light block wargame you cannot go wrong with this beauty. However, this game does lack originality: it is not that different from many other Columbia Games games. Moreover, this game is not really a simulation.

Definitely not the big eye opener I had expected from my first experience with a block wargame. I lost twice as the white York side. Playing the game feels like blind driving to me: while I usually have a pretty good idea how to perform in a typical hex-and-counter game, or in a card driven wargame, I haven't found out yet how to actually improve in my play.

Maybe, as the white side, it's better to avoid bloody battles, and to concentrate on treachery rolls?

RATING: 7
Although this block game has many standard features of Columbia Games, with an 8-page rulebook and rules familiar from "Hammer of the Scots" or "Crusader Rex," the designers added some bells and whistles to distinguish this title from those and add some complexity to game play. 

As written, the rule book also points out the limitation of holding to an 8-page rules format, whereas with this one, maybe a 12-page rulebook with additional illustrations would have been preferable. The result is that there is a lot more to remember, so that raises the complexity slightly, although people familiar with certain Columbia titles won't find this daunting to learn, nor will experienced war board gamers. 

More to the point, learning how to play this game well is going to take time and many repeated plays. But that speaks well for the design, and you can't blame the designers and developers for wanting to add some different twists to the standard Columbia block game formula. 

My rating of '7' my initial one, after my first two plays in which I had to spent most of my mental energy getting all the many rules particulars into my head (but not quite). Subsequently, I hadn't really cracked the surface of the possibilities in strategy prior to trading my copy in 2014, mainly due to my personal lack of interest in the period depicted--not because it's not a good design or game. (I got the game in 2012.)

Block and area game of the War of the Roses. There are three rounds and at the end of each the player with the most blocks in England and Wales becomes king, exiling his opponent, though they return for the next round. The player who wins the third round wins the game, so the player who won the second round usually has the advantage, but try telling that to Henry Tudor. the blocks are very well done, the map is a bit flimsy and the rules are simple enough. Good for a quick game as each round takes 30 minutes to set up and play.

RATING: 9
"Kingmaker" without Parliament (sort of), playable in under 3 hours. A really fine game. Some compromises were made for playability's sake, but I feel they hit a VERY sweet spot between playability and historical feel. RIII may become my favorite Columbia game, but I freely admit to a period bias.

Sometimes it feels like it's over too quickly, but I have a hard time criticizing a game for that. Especially when I can't wait to play it again. Haven't tried the scenarios yet (just posted today - 10/01), but they look interesting.

The scenarios are good fun as well, especially if your time is limited. I'm giving RIII an extra point because I'm liking it more every time I play it.

RATING: 6
I'm not a wargamer by nature so I think the amount I get out of Richard III is always going to be limited. It's quite difficult to find a strategy that isn't blown away by some decent tactics which can make planning slightly obtuse - to the level that, as a newbie, I don't feel you can do much.

After half a dozen plays, all of which I've enjoyed, it's still on the "good, but not for me" list.

RATING: N/A
I have two copies of this...

The board looks eerily like Kingmaker (albeit with wooden blocks). That's not surprising because it covers exactly the same 'Wars of the Roses' theme. However, the game plays very differently. It is somewhat asymetric because the Yorkist player has to take the fight to the Lancastrians, and it includes some interesting mechanics. Tho' war gamers will prefer Richard III, Kingmaker is the more elegant game.

Better balanced than Crusader Rex. Selection from the 'pool' seems to allow a little more control than I had expected.

I thought that this would be the same as Hammer of the Scots, but it turned out to be subtly different. The nobles don't "heal" in this game, meaning that every step loss is permanent. This makes the use of other units, such as levies and mercenaries, important as cannon fodder.

Another solid Columbia block wargame entry.  Enjoyed my one and only play so far.  Need to work on my strategy - I managed to kick the snot out of my opponent's armies, but since i did not get to his heirs wound up with the loss.  Need to stay focused on those victory conditions!

Apart from a problem with the map, which colubia games  replaced, I must say the components did not disappoint.

Basically, I've totally reassessed my feeling about RIII:WotR: at first I was really excited about a game from the desiger of Hammer of the Scots, a game I love. RIII seemed fast and furious, with many new considerations opened up by the greater possibilities for sea movement and the three types of border limits. 

However, I'm now fairly disappointed and regret my blind purchase. It's just no fun to play as Lancaster. You have every incentive to turtle and little capability to attack. Victory can only be achieved by withdrawing your troops into bunches that can reinforce each other and then pray you get the right cards and dice rolls; once you're behind, you have no way to catch up. 

I'm loathe to write off a game as imbalanced, as asymmetry is one of the most interesting things in wargaming and it works so well in HoS. Indeed, often it is fun to play the "weaker" side. But that it what I find so unforgiveable about RIII: Lancaster is both weak and boring. I haven't seen anything on BGG or Consimworld to convince me that this is not the case; the most positive I hear is that people still need to work  out how to play Lancaster, but over six months after the release, I haven't seen any indication that any one has done so. All the early reports of Lancaster victories now seem to have been the product of Yorkist mistakes due to unfamiliarity with the game rather than a real Lancaster strategy. 

I haven't fully given up on the game yet, and my opinion might change when I hear about/see more interesting options for Lancaster. Therefore, my rating could easily go up again.

Traded for Frontline: D-Day.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quicker, but more fiddly than the baseline Hammer of the Scots. After a game of two of this (like HoS), it'll be quite quick to pick off the shelf and play. I was concerned that there was no need to own two block games, but this is sufficiently different for me to not only own both, but also to seek out Julius Caesar now that I'm confident that they all play very differently.

Richard III really has a nice set goal to achieve after three rounds, and it rewards players that can pace themselves and conserve their nobles, yet also hit hard when opportunity arises and take a noble from your opponent. The two sides play completely differently as the Lancasters use their initial defensive bonuses to try and hold out against the out of position and slightly stronger York forces.

The units are more varied than in HoS, and playing the variation well is critical. Spare the nobles and use the mercenaries and city forces. Like HoS fortunes can swing wildly on a few lucky or unlucky rolls, but it's how you deal with these windfalls or setbacks that make the game. Battles are more interesting than in HoS because the highest strength unit is taking all the hits from the opposing unit, so attack order and how you take your hits is important. Additionally you have the option of heir charges, treachery rolls and a fourth round parting shot to spice up the battle action in comparison to HoS.

I'd say the first play of this is going to be very fiddly as you come to terms with nobles that have roses and those that don't, and all the little exceptions built in for historical flavour. After you've addressed each issue a couple of times though it'll become second nature. The event cards do seem a bit of a bother (weak) - I find myself hoping I don't draw any. (Muster is next to useless for the Lancaster player.) Yes, you can combine them with other cards in your hand to surprise your opponent, but I'd rather the flexibility of pure AP cards where I'm not forced to (potentially) be going first.

Excellent stuff and a game that with about a 90 minute play time I'll be hoping to get to the table often. I must say that the game seems to be a lot more fun as the York player. For the Lancasters to have a chance they have to play a very patient defensive game looking for mistakes by their opponent. Their forces are weak unless defending in home areas and it can get a little dull positioning and manoeuvring into defensive positions. Worth exploring further though.

This title has the most chrome out of all those using the [b]Hammer of the Scots[/b] system. The rules concerning the Nevilles and Warwick are particularly easy to forget. The Yorkists are slightly more powerful, being able to call upon some excellent mercenaries. In the pursuit of killing enemy Rose Nobles, you do so at the risk of losing Royal Heirs. Lose too many of either and you lose the game.

The rules for winter attrition are too lenient in this game, resulting in only a single step loss. This allows the creation of a 'doom-stack' in London (counts as one Rose Noble) that's impossible to attack successfully, due to the maximum limit of 4 units crossing borders from one direction. I would recommend using a house rule where attrition eliminates 3 steps instead of one, or disallowing stacks larger than 4 blocks enforced at the end of each impulse.

[3 plays] Good thematic depth, interesting game play, rules are pretty tight, and the wide open tactical options leave lots of room for decision. My initial impression is very favorable, however I believe we barely scratched the surface on strategy and tactics. I suspect this is a game that shines the brightest with regular play.

If you like Hammer, Liberty, or Crusader Rex and you like this period of history, I think this could be a home run for you.

Most recent play Dec '14.

I think I like Julius Caesar a better as it seems  a bit simpler, but I need to try it again.  I was pummeled on my first attempt.

Like many Columbia games the defenders have a big advantage sometimes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
More random (combat) and chaotic than HotS. Doesn't have the same elegant asymmetry (scots guerilla tactics vs. english build up and winter offencives) either.

If you really play it a lot, you can probably press some more nuanced strategy out of it. My impression after a couple of plays is that the huge expanse of southern england makes it too easy to get your troops where and when you want them.

It's also too easy to loose fatal pieces in combat, yet you have to engage the enemy (especially as Lancaster) to try and win over some of those enemy nobles with treachery rolls.

Without knowing much about this period of history, I'd say that a conflict with long periods of time between military campaigns like this should include some political elements.

RATING: 9
Different enough from Hammer of the Scots to distinguish itself. Combat has a few more options, it is shorter, and less swayed by lucky pool draws. I still prefer Hammer due to my love of the period, the asymmetric forces, and the fact that there seems to be more maneuvering in Hammer.

Five plays in, I'm liking this. There are important choies to be made all the time. That's all you do, every action point is vital. And even then it's random enough to allow for a difference in skill levels and still be playable. Nice.

Light wargame based on my favourite period of English history, what more could I ask for.  Plays quickly but has room for a great deal of tactics.  I prefer Richard III to HOTS due to it's more destructive combat system and having more emphasis with actions on the board rather than HOTS wintering system.

RATING: 7
Picked this up as "Baby's First Block Wargame", a job to which it is admirably suited. It's a simple system; as I have come to expect from wargames, most of the trouble comes from [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/51592/richard-iii-chrome-summary]historical chrome and the exceptions it requires[/url]: Warwick gets treachery bonuses on Kent and Salisbury but can't make treachery rolls against Northumberland or Westmoreland; non-rose nobles don't permanently die, [i]except[/i] the Nevilles; Scottish mercenaries can't move by sea but French mercenaries can...

The production is also sometimes frustrating. The rules are occasionally ambiguous and key terms are not defined. Blocks could have, but don't have, affordances to remind about exceptions -- the obvious one is that bombard blocks could say "A3-D3" instead of "D3". Enemy nobles in the pool that are only acquired through treachery rolls could have some minor visual distinction, like a subtle border or background effect, to make sorting them easier. There could be a graphical player aid to help with setup, or border entrance markers. It's not that these things are terribly onerous to work around: it's that everything is a little bit harder than it has to be, and for such a simple game, harder than it [i]should[/i] be.

Regarding the actual game part...

I'm not sure what to make of the fog of war. I don't much like memory elements, and to play well here you really need to keep track of what is where. The problem is exacerbated because in early plays you won't have a clue as to what is what, either.

That quibble aside, Richard III offers a very nice balance of tactical and strategic considerations. Probably my favourite thing about it is the use of three campaigns which partially reset -- the obvious (gamey) implication is that it's more important to kill nobles who will die permanently than those with children, but there are also more interesting considerations around positioning to block home areas for returning nobles or in preparation for the next war.

The luck factor is also occasionally vexing. The dice play is fine and expected, but I'm troubled by the action point cards. The last game I played had 14 points on the York side, just one above the mulligan level, and 21 on the other: going second is often advantageous, but mostly for manoeuvre of deployed troops. As the Yorkists start with [i]everyone[/i] off board or in exile, there was nothing to manoeuvre and it proved painfully difficult to do anything much at all. I suppose this is the sort of thing that will (usually) balance out over the three campaigns, and in general I like that forces the use of different strategies to accommodate what you have in hand. But still, I'm on the fence.

Overall, I like this game a lot. I think I'm going to stop looking for area conflict euros, because what's the point? Wargames do it better.

Um. It's been a while since I played this and I'm struggling to remember much about it.

I'm told it's historically accurate and as such almost impossible for one player to win. That player lost in our game, so ... success?

It's a moderately fast playing block game with some semi-hidden information, though I didn't really care for the returning home aspect each year.

First impression after one game. Re-themed Hammer of the Scots. Just like Hammer it feels like chess with dice.

RATING: 9
Rating after first play.  A friend and I finished a first learning game in about 3 hours, and I would expect we'd get the time down to two hours with practice.  Best production values I've seen in a Columbia Game.  The board, blocks, and cards are all beautiful.  In our first match, we both played rather recklessly, but even with more sensible and conservative moves, I expect that the game will remain satisfyingly vicious and bloody.  It also struck us that white may have a hard row to hoe.

We made a couple of errors with the rules, but fewer than in first plays of many other games.

I have now seen understandable comparisons made to AH's Kingmaker.  Richard III is a very different take on the same period of history.  Whereas Kingmaker runs with the assumption that the War of the Roses were in fact a conflict fought among shifting factions of nobility for (indirect) control of the royal heirs and then the monarchy, Richard III makes the more common sense assumption that the conflict was in fact a protracted struggle between the two rival houses of Lancaster and York.  The other noble houses are crucially important, but the royal heirs show up as central players in their own right, rather than the easy hostages of whatever noble faction happens to come along and grab them first.  Obviously this makes it a 2-player affair, so if you're looking for a replacement for Kingmaker, you may need to wait for GMT's Crown of Roses
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Although I don't know very much about the history of the Wars of the Roses, I enjoyed the game quite a bit.  The game has an interesting "sniping" feel to it in which you can try to cherry-pick battles and just pick off some small battles rather than build up for one heavily-defended objective.  The way Nobles can switch sides can really swing things, and perhaps may feel a little arbitrary or lucky when it happens.

Update 2017: Sold. Changed rating accordingly from 7 to 4, since my gaming habits are very different now compared to 8 years ago. 

First play (one campaign, 1470) felt just right, like an advanced version of HotS. 
Second play was a full campaign, but we stopped after the second campaign. It seems to be very hard as pretender (I was, and remained king).
Third play: fighting the rules instead of the enemy. Needs sequential plays before the flow kicks in.

The best of the block games I have played so far. It is difficult to wrap your head around the strategy but it is really important to pick your battles. Especially as the pretender you want to avoid big battles like the plague and pick off the royal nobles one by one. Harder to say than to do. Lots of fun, tough decisions in a compact package.

The overall mechanics are the same as most Columbia games. This game is a little more brutal the HoTS. I will need to play this one a few more times to get a better feeling of where this game falls on my ratings. Knowing the places, reinforcements of each side and the shields is very important. Still not sure I entirely understand how to strategize wintering in this game.

3 plays. Enjoyed this title very much. Needs more plays but my rating is preliminary. A game of movement and positioning, carefully choosing where and when to fight. Trying to corner and kill nobles. A game of cat and mouse with large swings.


The good:
@ Fantastic period/setting
@ Quick set-up
@ Fast game, 3 hours
@ Great gameplay
@ Simple rules with lovely setting-specific rules
@ High replayability
@ Rules/map allows for many different strategies

The bad:
@ Balance (As is, York seems stronger) Easily fixed.


Can't wait to play again. Another instant-classic from Colombia games. Now if they could just do a block game on the vietnam war.

I love this block game for it's ruthlessness. There are some big hitters in this game, and the rule changes where the biggest block has to absorb ALL the damage is nasty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In a game where block recruitment (via action points) plays such a large role, players can get properly hosed by drawing multiple events - especially in the first campaign.  (If you're destroyed in the first campaign, by the way, don't plan on ever coming back.) I realize that the mulligan rule was included to offset this problem, but it often doesn't kick in when it really should.

I wonder whether the event cards shouldn't have been in a separate deck.  Or [i]something[/i].  But even that wouldn't fix the problem of a player drawing an offensive event when a defensive event is needed, and vice versa.  Perhaps Columbia should have gone with dual purpose attack/defense events - with a choice of one of each type per card.

And man, those Yorks.  Who knew that they invented the steamroller.

Update:

A depressing statistical fact...

Since both players draw from the same small deck, if you have a lousy starting hard (2s and events, mostly) it's much more likely that your opponent has a killer hand of 3s and 4s.  That's tolerable in most other block games, but it's murder in this one, due the importance of recruitment.  In particular, a bad first hand for Lancaster - combined with Lancaster's initial board position - is devastating to the point where it's nearly an auto-loss.

Second update:

Criticisms aside, Richard III is fairly open-ended and just plain fun.  Most notably, Heir Charges, Treachery, and vicious mercenary suicide attacks (VMSAs) are cool.

Rating upped to reflect the number of cheers and fist pumps in our last few games.

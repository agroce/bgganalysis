4 plays / 5,6 players

LIKE: Nice dice rolling "gear" mechanism. There is more strategy than it first appears, especially in planning, optimizing, and blocking the track turns.
DISLIKE: Not much game arc, unless you add the narrative yourself. Games can get long. It's more fun when you are rolling well, bad rolls can ruin a long effort.

OVERALL: It's a game about risk management for each time you roll. The racing theme is felt more with many players. I think it's a good game with the right group.

It's the dice rolling race game tour-de-force. It's not the kind of thing I'm likely to suggest, but if it were the talk of the room, I'd throw down dice with everyone - no problem. If I were a race fan, I might enjoy it quite a bit. I like the shifter to mark your gear (die). Over all, very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only played on the maps included in the base game. Just felt like there wasn't much decision making as most of the gear changes were pretty apparent and it just degenerated into dice rolling for victory. Perhaps some of the other maps offer more choice but I doubt this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fairly fun game, mostly due to the theme (the feel of racing against your opponents - the more the merrier), but it is basically a luckfest where the players must make choices based on probability.

Good, solid fun game.  Yes it has luck, but also a lot of strategy.  One of the nicest looking games out there, and of course the theme fits.  Rules can be added as you go, which makes it good of newcomers as well as people that have played awhile.  Game length is the only negative, and its long enough that this game does not come out too often.  If you love racing games, it&#039;s a must have!

RATING: 6
This one has a lot of potential, but there are some serious flaws in the game.  I don't mind the random aspect of the die rolling or the "gotcha" aspect of slipping ahead or ramming someone, but that rule of roling the black D20 and if you roll 1-4 you loose an engine point has got to go.  I made it half way around the track and was out.  Both engine points lost to someone else roling high when in 5th or 6th gear.  What are we all attached to each other with wires?  How does his rolling well effect my car?  Sorry, this rule destroys this game for me.  I don't care if I play it again...

Ok, I have been convinced to play this one again and so far the black D20 (engine damage) hasn't been a factor.  With two lap races the game is actually quite enjoyable.  I hate to say it, but I think I might have to pick a copy up.

8/4/11 - Picked this up at Gen Con, really can't wait to play it!

8/13/11 - A super fun racing game, I just wish this had the nifty dashboard that comes with the Formula D game. Not a big fan of the pencil and paper, but I can't complain since I got a really good deal on Formula Dé. I would like to pick up some additional tracks for this in the future, and I might even buy Formula D sometime too. I only did a one lap race on my first play, but I can't wait to try a two lap race next time. I was really aggressive my first time playing and almost wrecked my car!

Formula De should be applauded for turning a much hated mechanic, "roll and move," and turning it on it's head. In other games, roll and move exists to support or activate other game mechanics. In Formula De, any other mechanics the game has exist to support the roll and move, and that's because it's truly the most compelling part of the game. The design is simple and elegant. It's easy to teach, and even easier to pick up. On the outside it may not look interesting to play for most people, yet ironically it's extremely accessible such that it appeals to most everyone. It's a rare game in that it's actually more fun with a lot of players (up to 12). Unfortunately, that makes it hard to find enough players to play as often as I'd like.

Fun Formula 1 racing game that blends luck (dice rolls) with planning.  Races tend to take longer than expected if everyone counts ahead instead of playing by instinct.

RATING: 7
Multi-lane candyland-like track and lots of dice rolling...recipe for disaster, right?  Wrong.  This game is so simple, but is somehow really fun having both strategic and tactical elements.  This is really an emergent-effects type of game that is almost a different game with 4 cars than 10 cars.  Fun both ways.

Also note that the reportedly long game times must be with high car counts because we can do our typical 6-10 car three lap race in well under an hour.  The key may be that we use the printed space counts on the side of the track instead of manually counting paths.

Small recommendation: use poker chips for resources instead of the pencil/paper method (mini does this with its one resource).  It is mechanically easier/quicker, and it makes it clearer what other cars have left, which enhances the strategic element.

RATING: 6.5
Formula De's quality, like any game so dependent on the role of the dice, can swing wildly from thrilling to dull based on the particular play session.

When you are in contention the game feels tense, and the decisions you make feel weighty. When you are lagging in last place -- far far off the pace of the main pack -- it's positively dreary.

Make this a single-lap affair and you reduce the risk of delivering one or two players into a 2-hour snore fest, while still giving the rest of the group a barrel of laughs.

Such a ball of fun. Only thing keeping it from a 9.5+ is the length of the game with a decent number of players. The downtime from turn to turn is also a negative.

Different types of rulesets allow it to be great fun for the whole family. For the kids you choose the basic gameplay and you will be astonished to learn that boardgames are even for the next generation not a thing of the past. If I get without any problems through the first corners I always tend to shift in higher gears and I pay the price for it in the following corner using all my breakpoints. Who would have thought that a boardgame about racing can be so much fun. Kids of 6 years and up (with a little help in the beginning) can play it. Needless to say it is a hard time for you if they win!

First game.  Your fate is primarily determined by the dice.  There is some tactical choices here and there but there is very little.  The game takes surprisingly long for what it is.

I like it, but it seems too long for a roll and move game.  Only played with basic rules.  So far, if you start in the top three, you end in the top three.   Not rewarded for risks taken.  Better with more people, however, more people makes it easier for the leaders to pull away as those behind get caught in traffic.

I've played a few racing games, none have impressed me as much as Formula De! The game is exciting and tense as we raced around those corners, taking chances when appropiate, smacking into each other or spinning out. I won my first despite being behind most of it by being a bit more conservative. I can't wait to try the advanced rules, this game is a winner!

Update: Played it two players with the slip streaming rules. Although I would like to play with all the advanced rules for more thematic satisfaction, I'm beginning to think that this is not a serious game, as the skill required to do well is not sufficiently challenging and luck seems to play a mayor role. It is still my favorite of all the racing games I have played, it is certainly the most thematic, and for that it gets my high marks.

[i]Posted: 6/18/09, Rated: 9[/i]

I purchased this game over two years ago, a copy from the final printing.  I had read so much about it, and I didn't want to miss out.  Of course, at that time I had no idea that [i][thing=37904]Formula D[/thing][/i] was in the works.  I was tempted to pick up a copy of the newer title after watching [url=http://www.boardgameswithscott.com/?p=117]Scott Nicholson's review[/url], and then remembered that I had never played the original.  It was time to give it a try.

[i]Formula Dé[/i] is a great game.  Yes, it has dice.  Wonderful, colorful, quirky dice.  They're fun to roll.  It's exciting to get into the higher gears and see how far your car can move.

There are also tear sheets.  I absolutely despise the decision to include [i]consumable[/i] components in games.  Yeah, I'm talking to you, [i][thing=915]Mystery of the Abbey[/thing][/i].  Even you, my beloved [i][thing=8217]San Juan[/thing][/i].  Just don't do it, okay?  Consumable items are a direct affront to my obsession for keeping my games in pristine condition.  How did I alleviate this condition with [i]Formula Dé[/i]?  I scanned in the sheets, added some color to the boxes, and then borrowed the resource cubes from [i][thing=18602]Caylus[/thing][/i].  Voilà!  Instant Eurogame feel.  In fact, I think playing the game with resource cubes instead of marking on scratch pads makes it even better.

The downside to the basic game at least is the advantage conferred upon the driver sitting in the pole position: when that person wins the game, then it feels like the entire game was decided with the initial role for turn order.  Minus one point for this perception.

Taking a risk through the turns to usurp the lead position can pay off when you get to move first in the next turn.  I highly recommend enforcing a house rule where players cannot count the moves out ahead of time: move your car, and you're not allowed to backtrack to find a better route.  You can count the spaces ahead of you after your turn is over; doing so helps to prevent down time.  My family quickly pushed their cars to the limits in an effort to take the lead.  And therein lies a now-surprising attribute of this game: player elimination.  Push your car too hard, and you are out of the game.  Get unlucky with your collision rolls, and you can be knocked out of the race.  It's a refreshing twist for a Eurogame.

[i]Formula Dé[/i] is a crowd pleaser.  If you don't mind roll-and-move with a little resource management to boot, then I recommend that you race out and pick up a copy of [i][thing=37904]Formula D[/thing][/i].  My only regret is that by the time I had purchased this game, all of the old tracks were long out of print.  Here's hoping that [company=157]Asmodée[/company] reprints them for use with their new game.

This plays faster than I expected!  It's a fun racing game, mostly about managing risk, and thinking about where you want to be 2-3 turns ahead.  Set your gear, and roll the die - you have to move that many spaces.  Higher gears get you going faster, but are riskier in the corners!

What a funloaden diceorgy! Two aspects make this game a design classic IMO:

1. There IS a lot of dicerolling, but the better player wins in the long run (say 10 games, which is statistically a rather short run).

2. The even greater design benefit is the fact, that the simple and original mechanics really fit the theme of the game. While there may be 999 better ways than in Agricola to depict how to build up a farm, I don't think there are many better mechanics to simulate a Formula 1 race. There are a very few games nowadays which achieve (or even care to achieve) this.

RATING: 6.5
This game is very simple. Roll the dice and move the result. The twist with this game is that you have flags at each corner telling you how slow they are on the track (the number on the flag sais how many stops you have to make in each turn to successfully drive through the corner and continue the race). The first to the checkerflag wins and it comes in 1 or two laps but it can be played in any number of laps I am sure. The added element of this game is that you have a number of tire markers and brake markers you can use if you with an unlucky roll of the die will overshoot a corner. When you have used up all your tires and brakes your car will spin or if you overshoot too much even crash and be out of the race. In addition you can get hit by other cars and on the off chans of a 1 on a d20 you will get a damage to your hull. The second damage you take will break your vehical aswell.This game is probably more fun to play for me since the people I play it with are both formula 1 freaks and follow the races. The cars and drivers are all accurate even if the results in our games end very different.("Schumacher" will even end up cheating if things don't go her way)

This actuallty only gets better.

One of the few games where I think the dice make the game more enjoyable. My group developed house rules where you had to take a drink every time you expended a point (brakes tyres etc). One driver despite an enormous lead couldn't manage to drink his way around the last corner which was heavy on the brakes and collapsed in a heap for 15 minutes unable to drink up while the rest of the pack eventually screamed past.

Obviously this is reprehensible behaviour and drinking alcohol like this  is very bad. Don't try this at home.

FANTASTIC, this game is equally at home, well at home, or on my JOB! (Lan Admn..thats right we play BOARD games when that door is closed!) and interrupts so well, you can get back into it much easier than most other games, really only flaw is that you cannot race EVERY track in the world on it!

A little clarification, while De' and D are really the same, they actually are not, clearly I like the new one and its street rules while not the main stay, will and do get time on my table, its a fun diversion. This one, however is timeless, to me. from the over the top art to the simple yet elegantly intense game play it will see time on the table for years to come. This and the fact that this version is what it is, and is not trying to be hip or trendy, give it the nudge in my book to a well earned, legitimate, 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Not the most accurate racing simulation I have got, but it is the one I enjoy most. I suspect that some people might find it a bit too long-winding, 10 cars on the road can make the race seem a bit slow. For me it is just right, but then I love dice. And risk-taking. Which means that a 2 stop corner looks soo tempting in 4th gear, especially if it makes the hop to the next corner a possibility too. There is much tension to be had from pushing your luck (and your car) around the track, and the law of averages usually mean that the state of my car is catching up with me halfway the second lap, only adding to the desire to push it that wee bit further and tempt fate for one glorious victory or, more likely, have the mother of all blow-outs just before the finish-line.

And yes, I am a really sad guy and would happily play this against myself. Just as well, because it will be the only way I am ever gonna get to play a tournament across all the boards I own. My partner likes it but not 'that' much, and if our weekly game-group would pick a game to play over and over again, this would probably not be the one.One small annoyance is the constant use of the black

Pretty good race car game.  Lots of decision making for the player as they manipulate the gears and speed against the demands of the course.  Also a strong random element with the different gears represented by different dice.  The whole game is an exercise in risk/probability management as the cars travel the course.  This is a regular with my family.  UPDATE: Downgraded from an 8. As my kids grew, the sheer repetition of roll and move wore out its welcome.  Donated this game.

This game is made for league play. It is a fun racing game that shines with lots of players. I would not likely play this game with less than 6 players.

I find sport games in general and racing games in particular especially boring, just a more sophisticated version of the Game of Goose: nonetheless Formula Dé surprised me as a tolerable game - more than expected at least - most likely thanks to the dice rolling and the clever way they’re used to simulate different gears.

[b]Update[/b] - No need to conceal my dislike of this game: I’ve never felt like joining any Formula Dé games ever since. Thus, during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from 6 to 4: maybe 3 would be more suited but honestly it’s not such a bad game, if you like the genre.

There isn't a perfect light racing game -- if there were, I would own it and stop buying.  In the meantime, I buy many that come out.

This remains a favourite because of the dramatic moments and the real-world connection.  I used to be into F1 and to race on famous tracks is a big appeal of this game.

That's why I'm not so interested in Formula D, which has some real tracks and some made-up tracks.  I'm sure the fictional tracks are well-designed, but that loses it some appeal in my eyes.

Have I played the game that much??  It's a great race game and the push your luck aspect is outstanding in it, as well.  If you play it safe, you lose.  You gotta know when to floor it and familiarity with the tracks really adds to that.

Fun, but rather long, racing game. Like crayon-rail train games, the boards are what keeps the game fresh for its fans. However, I think that there are more interesting decisions for Formula De players to make. My chief complain is with the record-keeping. Too much opportunity for fudging. I would like to see a token system for each vehicle system that players then draw and spend when building and making vehicle checks. (Update: Picked up the Asmodee reprint. Which, by all appearances, is a straight reprint of the Eurogames version.)

The specialised dice per gear are a great idea for a game mechanic. Game can be a little slow. Best played as a championship of 3-6 races with points awarded as per F1. Makes every place count!
Hard/soft tires decision not really a hard choice as hard seems better since damage absorption so important.
House rule: overtaking difficulty - if the drive ahead of you wants they can force you to pay +1 movement point for the 2 adjacent spaces when overtaking them on a straight. This makes slipstreaming very important and allows lead drivers to block (as in real life) so leads to more difficult decisions about getting closer to a turn so you lead going into it. Try it and see!

I want to like this game more than I do - I like the idea, the mechanic of the gear shift, but when I play it I realise how annoying it is, basically you pick a gear (usually totally obvious) then roll the die ... not much to it at all. Winning or losing usually comes down to your opponent rolling low and stopping short of a critical corner, or you doing it instead. Also suffers from downtime and taking too long. I prefer the mini version.

Es un juego de carreras de coches de fórmula uno. El juego fue reeditado en el 2009 (aprox), pero éste es la versión antigua. Permite hasta diez jugadores. Cada coche tiene unos parámetros que pueden ir variando según eventos de la carrera. Según la marcha que lleve el coche, avanza con un dado u otro. Está entretenido. Además, incluye variantes avanzadas para simular otras cosas (metereología, por ejemplo). Está entretenido.

Adquirido en las CLBSK2012 a chesirecat a cambio de un Manhattan.

En Peñacastillo desde Navidad 2013

Vendido a Juan Carlos, entrega en mano, en Santander, junto al MasterMind y el Genial, por 40€, en mayo 2015

I like this, even though bad die rolls can really screw you (like landing one short of a turn in fourth gear).  Part of the game is trying to determine the best way to reduce the luck factor.  It also has the feel of a formula one race.

This is a fun little game.  It is accessible, and scales from 2-10 players.   With the right crowd, I'd like to play a full season of races sometime. The only downside is that it can take a while to play a race, especially with 5-6 or more players.

This game is good fun to play, it would be better with the addition of beer, the cursing and shouting are great fun to partake in and listen to!

Update:  An awesome game for many people, the 'betting' on whether to stay in a high gear and risk danger or to drop a gear and make teh corner - or even to drop a gear and time a corner with a upward gear change makes for a great little game.  Love it!

I am looking forward to the Asmodee Editions reprint - I'll be sure to grab my own copy when it becomes available.

I was hoping this game would go over better than it did with my group. In hindsight, I don't think we had enough cars on the board. It was a 4-player game so we should have done 2 cars each, just to keep the corners interesting. We'll give it another shot and hopefully I can boost this rating.

Well, it's obviously a dice fest, but that alone doesn't make the game bad.

Very good race game - but watch out for those curves, they kill you every time.  Of course there's randomness but get your gear selection right and you'll be a lot luckier than those who get it wrong.

The race game genre has a lot of fundamental problems in my opinion, and Formual De seems to typify them for me. Not much in the way of decisions, and far, far, too long - becomes tedious fairly rapidly. At a quarter of the length, would be a good game. Maybe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm a big fan of race games, and this is no exception. At it's core, Formula De is really a push-your-luck resource management game; you're always gauging risk vs. reward, trying to push your car as hard as you can without crashing and burning.

You really need to play a multi-lap race with pit stops for the full enjoyment, and if you really love the game, it absolutely shines with league play.

Much like Blood Bowl this game is enjoyable viewed as a standard board game but this game truly comes alive when played in a multi-race format. The detail to the rules based on real life is great. Plus you can race on multiple game boards based on real life tracks from all over the world.

I generally like racing games, despite not really being a racing fan. I haven't played Formula D, so I can't really contrast to the new implementation. I prefer Speed Circuit overall, but I do find rolling the gear dice fun.

RATING: 6
The player count on this one is pretty rough - it technically supports up to 10, but with too few people (where you're both controlling two cars) it feels off and with more than about six it just takes *ages*. It's a shame, because there's really neat elements to this design but it just feels a little antiquated at this point JUST because of the length. It's really only plays in a reasonable amount of time with 4-6, and even then only if everyone is playing quickly.

The way the board works (with regards to turns, other cars, etc.) really requires some fun forward planning when it comes to managing probabilities - especially when you're behind! It is a game of constantly taking chances, and you really have fun options for when things don't go the way you planned (which, in a dice game, is a lot of the time). Lots of tension around pushing your luck + lots of ways to react to your rolls = good use of dice!

The board is ugly though. Why is the board so ugly? Ugh. I want the new version just for a less ugly board. And more sensible box size.

Update: Dammit! They remade it in a better box size. I still can't justify upgrading though. Maybe in a trade, someday.

Update: It's hard to want to play this now that Snow Tails exists just thanks to the drastically reduced playtime. Unless I end up with exactly 6 players this really doesn't see play.

I have a blast playing this. I really like it with fewer people (4 or less) playing 2 cars each as well. Must play at least 2 laps for luck and starting advantages to even out. The only die roll in the game that annoys me is the one for the pole at the beginning, as starting ahead is a huge advantage. I think it might be fun to auction the pole using resources (tires etc.) I would love to play an entire season some time.

Entertaining. Rules seem a little lacklustre, I think they could have come up with some cleverer mechanisms, particularly for the monotonous "collision" roles .. haven't tried the advanced rules yet, may get rated higher... On the plus side, can support 10 players out of the box. - Edit: Just tried the advanced rules ... a little better ... however was a bit bored after 3 laps ... think I need more than 3 cars on the track.

My big problem with this game is that it's so simple that I need stakes to be invested in it, or at some point I just start looking at my phone between turns, say for instance if I fall too far behind. But playing this in the TEG league with a IRL prize to play for was a really fun ride. Definitely a game that shines better when played with friends.

RATING: 7
This game is very easy to love and to play.  However, it can be more difficult to master.  I initially played played a few rounds in "Time Trial" mode, without other cars on the track, so my thoughts were a little skewed.  However, having now played with multiple cars and players, the game is much more enjoyable.

Well done game.

Edit:  I removed my rating, because I don't ever want to play this game again.  Why?  Because I own Formula D, so why play Formula De?  Get it?  But to "never want to play again" would mean I should rank the game a 2, and I just can't do that, because it really is a "7.5" on my scale of "1 to 10".  So instead, it gets no rating at all.  See Formula D for my rating.

Second EDIT:  I revised my rating again, and put it back.  However, I purposefully dropped it below the 7.5 that I give to Formula D because I think the re-implementation is slightly better in terms of graphics and the cars (as well as the gear boxes and other niceties).  But this is still a great game.

Keep - Collection
One of the all time best racing games ever.  Game dynamics are simple - you get a certain sided die depending on what gear you are in.  It starts with a d4 and goes up to a d30.  You can shift up one gear each turn or down one gear each turn.  If you want to downshift more then you take damage. Each corner has a number of stops that you are required to make in it.  If you don't make the required stops then you take one point of damage for each square you travel outside of the turn.  Very simple rules.

The artwork for the boards are wonderful and easy to understand.  Additionally the selection of expansions is great, with most known racing courses covered - allowing you to race at your nearest track!

This is a great racing game.  The pace and feel of the play can really make you visualize the action of the cars running the track.  While the dice do add some luck, I don't think it overpowers the game as you have so many choices in how to plan your moves and modify your movement.

I like racing games in certain contexts, and I think FD has a lot of very cool ideas, particularly the clean stats system and the gear box that uses the classic odd shaped RPG dice. However, this is a game, much like another car game, Car Wars, that I want to like more than I actually like, and for many of the same reasons.

With a race game, what I want ideally is the fast paced exhilaration of the real thing. What FD gives you is a fairly clean, fairly accurate portrayal of racing, but which feels painfully slow at times, even with relatively fast play. Singular laps seem to take about 3/4 of an hour, and while that means a 2 lap race is still clocking in at a touch under 2 hours (fudging somewhat because of the need to make your driver(s), &c.) I still think this game is overstaying its welcome within that window...this is a perfect example of 30 minutes of fun within 2 hours of play. I probably should try the Mini version, since that seems like it would significantly speed play with its easier damage system and smaller tracks.

I can appreciate the game, and I can understand why it has a following, but it's just not my particular bag.

So many variables to simulate an F1 race and the availability of several dozen tracks makes it unlikely that this game will ever become stale for us.

The game does tend to create a lot of downtime between turns with the maximum number of players, which can be a negative, although having the maximum number of players also creates the most tension as the turns quickly become blocked.

Reducing my rating after additional play. The "right" thing to do seems pretty obvious--or at least close enough, since there is such a large range in possible outcomes for each die role beyond 1st gear. Die rolls seem to determine too much. Most of the time is spent counting spaces. Doesn't even *feel* like a real race.

I have been told that some people play this game to match the genuine Real Life Grand Prix and take out a new board whenever a race is completed. I can hardly type straight at the thought of such a horrible scenario. Formula Dé is a game of endless die rolling and people mastering the art of steering through corners. And once they have, it becomes a game of lucky dice which goes on forever. For the love of all that is holy, just throw a single die once and determine the winner by the highest throw, will you? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
When played in League format, over a whole season, the game would rate about an 8, because desperation play by the losing players would be eliminated.  Otherwise, the players who are a lap behind do crazy things near the end of the race.  The reality aspect (the tracks and so on) is neat and we love the use of different dice for different gears, but it does come down to a lot of rolling and luck sometimes.

I know that many consider this a dicefest.  It is fun to play with probability and make the decisions that have to be made.  League play is fun.  Your bad die rolls should average out over the course of a season.

RATING: 8
nice game - there is more to it than just rolling dice - forward planning is crucial - two lap races are much better than a one lap race. The more you play this the better it gets.

Monaco - lots of corners - a taxing course.

Zandvoort - fairly fast and combines with Zandvoort II to make a massive track.

Zeer geinig racespel (ook vrij uniek denk ik?) met leuke mechanismen zoals schakelen en verschillende dice voor verschillende versnellingen.

Hoewel invloed toch ook hier hoge geluksfactor.

2008-01 update: just got in a trade for Primordial Soup.  Although very high on the luck factor,  it does have a certain addictive quality that is irresistable.  Maybe it's that push your luck feel when gambling for a good roll, I don't know.  As I suspected, this is a game that goes over well at home.

The first time I played this game, I really hated it.  In retrospect, that probably had to do with the fact that I was coming down with the flu at the time, and was feeling awful.  It took me years to try it again, but the second time I played it, I really enjoyed it, enough to take it off my trade list.  The 7 rating is provisional--it could go up after the next play; I doubt it will go down.

Okay game but often difficult to peg the leader/leaders back.  Element of luck probably too invasive.  That said, can be fun with multiple players just playing free and easy.

Si te gustan las carreras de coches este es el mejor con mucha diferencia del resto, además de uno de los primeros en desarrollar esta mecanica sino el primero. se trata de ir metiendo marchas que al cambiar, a la vez cambias de dado a un dado de mayor numero de caras y el numero que te sale en la tirada es lo que avanzas y puedes romper el coche, el motor, chocar, es un gran juego.

RATING: 8
Great game for a mixed crowd. Dangerous (but fun) to use as a drinking game. Versatile, entertaining, surprisingly devious. Must resist temptation to indebt myself for further boards!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Easy and fun racing game. The board pleases the eye and attracts the attention of non-gamers as well. Only downside: for such a light game, it definitely takes too long to play, especially with 4+ players.

UPDATE: I'll downgrade this to a 4, just because of the huge downtime with 4+ players.

Neat race car game.  Cars have limited amounts of braking.  The question is can you make it across the finish line without crashing.  Players change gears constantly as they go into turns and straight aways.  Can you roll that lucky die and make it or do you wipe out?  Fun game for most. I liken Formula De to a sort of euro style game.  This is the precursor game to Formula D.

Five teams, ten cars, two circuits. Take on the role as Formula 1 driver and race for victory around the Monte Carlo (Monaco) and Zandvoort (Netherlands) circuits. Gear up or down and throw the corresponding dice, but be careful! You might spin off, get a flat tyre or even crash!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A racing game that is easy to catch on to, but hard to master.  This game plays well with many racers as rolling for damage is more frequent and blocking people in is a dirty, yet effective tactic.  Always a treat to watch the really "aggressive" racers take the corners without downshifting and burning all their brakes and tires, then realising "Oh crap, I still have 6 more turns to take" and then...fiery wreck!

Fun game to play but I wish I had more tracks to play it on. Didn't realize that it was out of print when I bought it about a month ago. Now to get the tracks I'll have to play a pretty penny for it. Other wise a fun game but not as fun as an older game I had called "Speed Circuit".

Sure, you&#039;re rolling a ton of dice in this game, but for those who think it&#039;s all luck - get outta here!  This game is a blast!

RATING: 5
I consider the game to be more of a gambling game than a race game - count the number of spaces to the next curve then choose the safe bet (die) or the risky bet. Takes too long to play for what is essentially a die-rolling exercise (and yes, I've played it many times and own several tracks). Sold it off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun and simple game, though it needs to sit on the shelf a few months between uses so that I can work up the inspiration to drive around the track again. I like that many tracks are available, but they are priced pretty steep.

Formula de is one of those fantasticly entertaining games, although you're not quite sure why.  The thing is mostly luck and there isn't a huge amount of planning that one can legitimately do in one's move, but somehow the game has a charm in is simplicity that keeps one hooked.  The superb range of tracks helps too.

I have a lot of fun with this dice-fest, but it hasn't grabbed anyone else in my group. No one hates it, but it's not loved either. A little too long for what it is and too much downtime. Much improved with a turn-timer.

RATING: 6
A decent game -- the roll-and-move aspect is uninspiring, but the gear-shift changes and the risk management of wearing down tires and brakes makes it interesting.  With the wrong crowd, it can be a disaster, though, as people wander off if they think they're too far behind.

I know it's just a roll and move, but managing the odds of gear selection and fully using your car give the driver sufficient control over his or her own destiny.  Plus, all the extra tracks are awesome.  I consider the rules and mechanisms of this game one of the most streamlined and self-evident.

This is my favorite racing game.  I have been able to entice gamers and non-gamers alike to try this one.  The basic and advanced rules provide enough variation to appeal to a wide audience.  Unfortunately, the expansion tracks are OOP and expensive.

RATING: 8
A classic racing game with tons of real-world tracks, allowing for extensive campaign games. I love pushing the limits, whether I crash and burn or pass the flag first. I love the system for gearing up or down and taking risks in the corners. Lots of replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
At core, a push-your-luck, dice-rolling gambling game with some tactical play in gear selection & positioning. Can drag with the wrong crowd, but is a lot of fun with enough cars on the track being steered by fast players with good intuition.
I usually bore of the game after 1 lap, but prefer ~3 laps for the tactics of car configuration, pit stops & judicious overshooting of corners to shine.

Monaco Track: Tricky track. The sequence of bends behind the pitts is heaps of fun. I do almost die of boredom grinding up that longish straight after the back 3 corner though.

RATING: 5
I'll play it because my kids enjoy it, which has suddenly developed into a completely unexpected passion. The game is simply too dependent upon the dice rolls. Admittedly, enough are made, so, in the long run, the odds should average out. The games starts to come into its own when all of the advanced rules (car design, weather, etc.) are incorporated. As a F1 racing game, it is a distant second to Speed Circuit (but Formula De is more user-friendly).(Vassal)

Fun but I'm usually more than happy just to play 1 lap. More than that and I feel it drags a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yes, it's a dice fest, but it really does feel somewhat like racing (it probably helps if you're a racing fan).  With some variant rules (mostly simplifying what are needlessly complicated rules and ignoring some black dice luck rolls), this becomes an excellent push your luck racing game. The track choices for the basis game are rather poor, unfortunately. Zandvoort is an instantly forgettable circuit, and Monaco is quite tedious in its slowness and predictability - quite unlike the real circuit. If you are a fan of the game, move right away to some of the expansion tracks.

I am not much of a racing fan so I was surprised at how much I ended up liking this game.  It's surprising simple to learn and can create a great deal of excitement as a tight race comes to the finish.  I've purchased several of the tracks and so far haven't been disappointed with any of them.

If you have 6 or more players in, ideally 10 (plenty of traffic makes it particularly fun)
then you are in business !

In reality, game rating is 6 for basic rules, and 8 for using modified rules.

However, some rules are entirely unrealistic (severe braking should result in loss of speed and require shfting down accordingly, etc...)

I am going to post some home rules here that we play tested and tuned for 3 complete championship seasons !

RATING: 8
Fun Formula One racing game. Best with four cars or more as fewer cars than that tend to get somewhat boring. The game can be long if you race more than one lap so I'd love to see some shorter circuits released.

Update: My sons love this game as well and so does their cousins. It's great fun to have five kids or more racing around the track and all wanting to go into 6th gear just to roll that huge blue die.

Update2: The game keeps getting better the more I play it, and all the kids love it. Upped the rating to 8.

Good game.  It was actuallz better then I thought it was going to be.  I always had this odd urge to buy it, though I was sure nol one but my brother would play it with me.  He did plus others, obviously, and it was a lot of fun.  I really enjoy the random element to the game and have fun going out on a limb and trying to push as hard as possible.  The three games I have played have all gone well with no one taking an unresonable length of time for their turns.  We will see if any one at school will play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really love the wear system.  But dry and lengthy for what it is.  Just betting on statistics over and over and over.  Needs something to spice it up.

Update 5->7: Play this game with the java client, and it becomes as fast and emotional as actual racing.  It removes all of the slow fiddlyness and leaves you with quick turns and no bookkeeping.

RATING: 5
Fast and furious Formula One driving game that can accomodate up to 10 cars. The essence of the game is players must select a gear and roll the appropriate die for that gear. First gear rolls 1 or 2, but 6th gear rolls between 21 and 30! Some simple rules for cornering and handling, in addition to spectacular components, adds up to a great F1 experience. The basic game comes with the Monaco circuit, but copious expansion tracks allow you drive the complete Grand Prix season, and most of the Indy Car season also! For a game that's really glorified die rolling, it's a heck of a lot of fun! My rating rises to around an 8 when played in a league format.

Initially unimpressive, but with customized cars, multi-lap play and only 4-6 players this would be quite fast and enjoyable. If i had this as a teen I'd have been set.

Formula "duh." There are no meaningful decisions to make when playing this game, and inconsiderate fans of the game will unconsciously reinforce this when you play with them:

Your turn arrives, and someone is already passing you the die that corresponds with the gear you "want to be in." And he's right of course. You could reject his decision, and shift to a different gear instead. But it's suicide. There's one "right choice," and it's been made for you.

You roll the given die, and instantly some Rain Man fan of the game is pointing out the exact spot on the board you want to move to. And again, he's right. You could move to some different space to be contrary, but you'll put yourself at a disadvantage if you do so. There's always only one "right space" to move to to avoid burning tire points, having a suicidally unlikely roll to make next turn, etc.

Essentially, you just sit around letting the game and its fans play you for 45 minutes until it blissfully ends. Or until you decide to commit suicide willfully to make it end faster.

For anyone who likes Formula 1, this is a must!  Each track is a good representation of the actual circuit, gears are reflected by different size dice and you have the ability to customize your car for different race strategies.  With corners rated for gears and the penalty for selecting the wrong one quite severe you need to plan your racing line carefully and know when you can push your car and when to hold back.  Great fun.

Light game. Very enjoyable for the whole family. Played it more recently. We enjoy ourselves. I am looking into getting some of the expansions to have different tracks to race on.

Race can take a while. Maybe a little longer than I would want. Especially when playing with children.

Played again recently, this time with the newer version. Newer has a nice twist to the game with interesting variants.

The best of all racing simulations. Easy for new players, excellent for experienced gamers. With options for advanced rules, teams and house rules, not to mention over 30 tracks, this entire system is top notch.

Good.  A truly fun game.  Simple enough that my grandmother can play it (and in fact has), but enough strategy to keep gamers interested.  Also, the racing theme makes my brothers (both car guys) want to play, so it's something we can do together.

Some bash this for it's "randomness", but I don't think it's a problem.  There can be some tough choices to make in the game -- some tracks are better for this than others.  Also, the dice used in the game are special dice that are biased towards a range based on the gear.  This game has actually gotten me interested in Formula One racing, something that I wasn't interested in before.  The boards are gorgeous, although I don't like the "cartoons" that are printed on them.  You can play this one quickly or not, depending on how many laps you want to run.  Enough optional rules to keep the game interesting (Weather, etc.).  Looks like this one would be fun in a league.  One of the few games that can accomodate lots of players comfortably (up to 10).  If you're playing the game with fewer players, run two cars each.

Needs many players for maximum chaos and blocking in the corners. The winner is the one who rolls the D30 the most times, pedal to the metal!
I prefer the old version over the new Formula D game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In my first game I was out of contention by the second corner. Wrecked by no fault of my own (except my terrible crash-check) shortly after that. So I guess this rating is a ballpark. It could go lower or higher, we'll have to see with another play someday. 

Another play, a little over a year after my fateful crash I have returned to Formula De. My rating has increased from 5 to 6. I like the dice distribution, the map design is easy to view, and the rules are easy and can be scaled up for a more complicated race. I don't like all the counting and breaks in the game. Overall, I do like the game to an extent, but I think I like racing games that are slightly more of an abstraction.

Formula De has been played with my kids a lot.  Unfortunately, dice have been lost.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like most dice-rolling games, the fun is derived from rolling the dice and hoping to get the number you want. The exultation you feel when you hit that turn in the right gear is unbelievable and of course, the game must be played with the customary vrooming noises! But game length is a serious issue, which affects replayability. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
[1 play] I was surprised by how mediocre and tedious I found this. I just can't see why anyone inhabiting a universe where Circus Maximus exists would ever bother playing this game. 

In terms of player interaction, Formula Dé falls between Rallyman and Circus Maximus.  FD has none of the deliberate interference/attacking of CM, but blocking and maneuvering is much more important than it is in Rallyman where you're spaced out and judged by time, not position. This game made me appreciate Rallyman (which I'm also lukewarm toward) a little more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My buddies love it, but I don't really understand why.  There's fairly little strategy and fairly little player interaction.  Count spaces, figure average roll, select gear, repeat.  Bleah.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is a dice rolling game with too much flim flam associated with it.  Getting the right die rolls at the right time is 90% of the game.  Partly scored like this because the gamemaster in our plays insists we do "time trial" in which each player races around the course individually to determine start order.  Adds about 1 hour to play time.  Also False Start (you lose a turn at the beginning) ruins the game for that player as you never catch up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nothing groundbreaking but the game is fun enough to pull out when I have more than two players. My 4 year old son likes to roll the dice and count the spaces with me sometimes too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I did not receive a good introduction to the rules but I discovered quickly that you can learn this game on the fly. I find it immensely satisfying. It really captures the feel of a high-speed road race in a past-faced, exciting game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A race game that exibits the mechanics of driving a real car.  The only problem with it that I can see is the luck factor may be a bit too high.  Often the person who takes a chance on the last lap and goes for broke by rolling the high number dies will come from behind and will win by sure luck.  Even with this problem it is quite a bit of fun.

RATING: 7.8
When you play a whole Grand Prix season of this, man does it get tense. The game can barely get much better. I have had it for years. Literally, it is one of the first game i ever got and it still gets my heart racing. We are currently in our 4th season of it.

This is a great game, in my humble opinion. Using different sided dice for each gear was an inspired design decision. I've played it with lots of different people and they've all enjoyed it.

RATING: 7
NT This game would get a ten because of how much fun it is to play with 6-10 experienced players. 

Nowadays I end up playing this as a "party" game. I would love to play a racing season with a steady group of people. The game is at it's best when the next person is ready to roll and move immediately. 

Otherwise the downtime and then game length can make this very unpleasant.

One of my favourite game, but it takes hours to play it, so it's a little difficult to set a game. Even if we can't say it's a simulation game (the cars takes the corners as long as they can instead of "cutting them" lol) it's funny to play if you are a racing fanatic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This is a nice little game and the gear mechanic is nice, higher gear= bigger dice, however I always find the game goes on far too long and after about 5 turns there is a player or players so far in the lead that the rest of the pack have no way to catch up.

There is also always one player who isn’t interested in winning the race just crashing into other cars and causing damage.

Played 10+ times. A good dice game. Captures the theme of car racing fairly well, but those dice can drive your crazy sometimes. One of only a very few dice games I'll actually play, probably due to the fact that the dice are customized so it's not a complete crapshoot. Player interaction is high on this one. Lots of groans and glad yelps. Artwork superb as well. Non gamers love this game: eye candy and easy to play with a great theme. I think this game is BETTER than FD Mini because the longer tracks allow for more catching up to the leader. [Trade?. Sell.]

RATING: 6.5
Best racing game due to the mechanics of gearing up & down, weather conditions, pit stops, customizing car, etc.  Nicely done.  I can see that the same track would get a little old, so the additional tracks make sense if you can get them.  The more the merrier in this game.

From a gamer's point of view, I really enjoy this game because it attracts so many players and novices that I just had to get it.  My only beef with this game is its total reliance on dice and I am not that lucky when it comes to that.  I'm amazed at the enduring popularity of formula 1 racing since these past few years there has been no drama to speak of except for the 3rd to last place finishers, but I can find enough partners for this game because it is a great F1 simulation.  ***  Had to update: we finally have some drama.  2005 is a season worth following finally!

Surprisingly strategic game for a roll-the-dice type. Lots of tough decisions to take during and before the race. Should you push your tires and/or engine or play it more safely? Slick or rain tires? 1 or 2 pit stops?

I could see how this game could be entertaining with a lot of people who enjoy the racing theme and take it for the light game it is, but for me it just seems to lack any strategy and completely fail to evoke any part of real racing for me.  The rules for corners are especially frustrating if you just barely miss entering by one space.  I would think it's strong suit would be its ability to accommodate a lot of players, but then it gets [i]really[/i] boring as you watch everyone count out the different ways to use their 15 spaces or whatever they rolled.

Excellent game.  I've played Formula D, Formula De, and Formula de Mini, and I think I now like Formula de Mini the most, Formula De secondmost, and Formula D leastmost.  See also my note for Formula de Mini.  I think I'll use the Formula de Mini set (and one of the Formula De tracks) next time.  I prefer having the plastic disks to keep track of car damage rather than writing it down.  I just wish Formula de Mini had the 6th gear (30-sided) die.  Oh well.  Played it again today (6-25-2011) and still enjoy it.  Might collect some pennies someday so that I can use those for damage points instead of handwritten on the small rectangular sheets the game provides.

O jogo é formado por um tabuleiro com uma pista de corrida que é dividida em faixa. Cada faixa é dividida em espaços do tamanho do carro. A mecânica basicamente é rolagem de dados de acordo com a marcha que o carro está. Se você está em 1ª marcha, rola o dado D3, se está em 2ª rola o D4, em fim, quanto maior a marcha maior o dado e os números possíveis de sair. O número que sair no dado é a quantidade de casas que o carro anda. A decisão principal fica sempre em manter, aumentar ou diminuir a marcha pois cada curva exige que você pare, entre uma jogada e outra, um ou mais vezes. Caso você não pare na curva você tem que gastar pneu e/ou câmbio para cada espaço que passou na curva. Pouca estratégia mas com decisões importantes. Bem divertido.

Dice don't like me for some reason. In turn, I don't much like them, either. However, the gear shifting and the additional feature points available in Formula Dé give the players just enough influence over their cars that they can actually feel in control even though they're still just throwing dice in the end. Malicious dice can still kill you here, but it's always a bit your fault, too. Why did you have to go through that corner in 6th gear in the first place?

Only a single one lap game with two players - it would seem dice games can be fun, possibly even more with more players and vehicles, although probably limited to racing gamer types, and hits only near the spot to stop making it a suggested game (14/12/08). UPDATE: I have tried to like this game for many years, but, I just do not enjoy it - at all. Rating reduced from 6 to 3 (6/1/12). UPDATE: Gone (3.482, Jan 17) UPDATE: A game with the new edition at Bordercon might have renewed my interest.  Play it for the concept of racing and not to win and its good fun (6.293, June 17)

One of the best racing games in my opinion. Well other than Stock Car Championship, which is the very best. It's a nice looking game with options to play different ways and has some really nice dice which are used to control what gear you are in and how fast you go. Everything flows nicely in this game. It is a lot of fun with a full compliment of racers. If you like race games, you will love this.

A great race game best played with 4 or more. Has rules for basic and advanced play. Shame it's so hard to get the expansion tracks now :(

There's not a LOT of decisions beyond risk management, and basically, it's just roll and move, but the sum is definitely greater than the parts. A fun game for the right crowd, takes a little long for what you get out of it.

RATING: 5
Fun roll and move and that isn't to be taken too seriously and you can play with a large group.  I think 5 might be the best number as it's a little more fun controlling two cars rather than just one.  Funny artwork on the various tracks.  I think you need the right group for a game like this and you want to play at a decent pace.  Having played this now a second time, I think it's fun, but I don't understand the love affair that people have with it.  It's ok.  Still, you roll a die, move, wait for everybody else.  Going multiple laps really drags it out.

Dice control too much of the game.  It is fun to press your luck sometime but the long time that it takes to complete even a single lap with more than two players makes it impossible to play a game representing a race with more than a few laps.

Gotta play it with the rule that players may not manually count spaces on the board using their fingers before they make their move. Also, without a timelimit on the move, it becomes a simple math and dice game, instead of the fast-paced formula racing game that it&#039;s supposed to be! (overall - prefer the more streamlined Formula De Mini)

I always thought of Formula De as no more than an "above average" game until we played a season series with carefully-tweaked rules, point standings, three-lap races, and car construction.  In that format, it's a blast - so long as you keep the pace moving.  Our group is prone to slowness, but we could generally finish an 8-car 3-lap race in less than two hours.  When it's your turn, you must immediately pick up the appropriate die, roll, and start moving your car.  No dallying.

This game does what I think race games should do; it’s fast, it’s fun and it plays well with many people. Even if you don’t take turns simultaneous there isn’t much down time to speak of and I feel engaged in what other players do. I have however one big caveat of it and that is that most of the turns the decisions seems obvious. Sometimes once in a while, there can be a tough decision, but usually not.

I think I prefer this to be played by many players, maybe six or up. Otherwise there will not be much blocking and the game will feel quite solitaire.

My enjoyment of this game is dependent entirely on the pace of play. If you grip it and rip it, it can be a lot of fun. If you ponder your die choice, then count, then roll, then ponder again, then count, then miscount, then count again, then move to the wrong space, then have to re-count ... well, not so good. Go with the flow and this is a fine game.

Really, I shouldn't like this game.  It's heavily dice/luck based, it's prone to runaway leader problems, and one mistake can ruin the game.  But honestly?  It's just too darn fun to get mad at.  Pressing your luck by trying to take a corner in a high gear is a blast and I find myself looking for more tracks and suggesting this more often than not.

Played 5+ I like this game best when playing 2 player with my 11 year old son. Essentially rolling dice and counting spaces. With lots of players there is quiet a bit of down time and the group can lose focus on the game. Recording results from race to race recommended.

*UPDATE* This game has not seen any play for a year. It does not capture the excitement of a race. Pitch Car or Speed Circuit are my racing games of choice. July 05

*UPDATE* Played 10+ times. Back on the table after a 10 year absence. Played with just 2, 2 cars each and 2 laps including the fun against the clock qualifying. Also used the slip-stream rules. It was fun played this way. I'll lift my rather harsh rating of 5 to a 6. Dec 2015

Don't like it. It's way, way too long (and slow), for such a simplistic game (choose gear, roll and move). How this got to be so highly-rated among gamers, I don't know. Maybe the advanced game is better, but then it will take three lifetimes to finish.

One of the few big games from that era of Euro games that I don't think is terribly good.

This game is just awsome for running a light hearted racing league. We do it every year based on the actual F1 circuit. One race a week with point system based on each weeks placement....just fun.
Many people view this game as a "total luck fest", I disagree. This is what I call a game of "luck management", much like most card driven games are considered "hand management". Sometimes, no matter how shrewd you play it you just lose. Life isnt fair either...go complain to the designer.

I love this game as it is so different to the other games in our group. The fact that our group generally avoids seeing car racing in any form and yet loves this game is a fine achievement. The ranking would be much higher if the tracks were available in larger groups, instead of just two in an expansion as there is little point in investing more money into a single game, when that money can be used to bring a new game to the group.

Version Antigua: Adquirido en compra conjunta. conservado por Ray

Yera aporto expansion P&P circuito de Valencia (sat view)

Jugablemente es una oca glorificada. tira dado y avanza para completar el circuito... pero con algunas normas muy bien pensadas que reflejan bien la tematica de carreras de coches formula. 

muy desafiante, accesible a todos los publicos y muy divertido... no se puede pedir mas. 

su pequeño defecto (de la version antigua) es que los materiales son un poco muy de los 80s (aunque el juego es originalmente de 1991). tableros para el jugador de lapiz y papel, y coches hechos a escala del tamaño de las casillas demasiado pequeños para ser vistosos (aunque alguna gente ha conseguido maravillas en ese sentido). su otro pequeño defecto es que su rejugabilidad va directamente emparentada con el numero de circuitos de que dispongas. y de serie viene con 2, con lo cual se hace repetitivo mas pronto que tarde. 

otro defecto es que a pesar de su aparente sencillez, algunas normas no son tan sencillas y de hecho son bastante debatibles (contactos y sobre todo, paradas en boxes). el manual no es del todo claro y este detalle le hace resentirse un poco. 

ideal para la tarde de domingo, y para cualquier tarde xD

hay gente que se lo toma muy en serio hasta el punto de hacer campeonatos con docena y media de carreras y una bateria de reglas custom para añadir de todo (KERS, etc). en mi opinion le roba al juego algo de sencillez y frescura.

My favourite game. Love it. It's a great racing simulator with enough randomness to pique the interest of some of my friends while not quite getting all the way through to others, thus not making it to the table as often as I'd like.

Race games are one of my favorite types and this one is the king. I really like the gearshifting in this game. It has a really good mix of strategy and chance for my taste. Plenty of player interaction, ability to accommodate lots of players, and rules that scale from easy enough for children to complex enough for high strategists make this one a winner. The mechanics are very different than any other game I own, and I like the theme as well. Considering picking up a few more tracks. UPDATE: Traded away due to getting a copy of Formula D.

This is a nice, quick playing race game, in which you need to manage your car's speed via gear shifting.  Each gear uses a different die; 1st = d4, 2nd = d6, 3rd = d8, 4th = d12, 5th = d20, 6th = d30.  Races are 1 to 3 laps, depending on how much time you want to spend, and how complex you want the game to be.  Pit stops are possible with 2 and 3 lap races.

My favorite racing game.  The clever dice "gears" and cornering rules make it more than a roll-and-move game.  Strategy requires you to push your luck and adds some real peril to the game play.  Best with lots of cars, so small groups should drive several car each.

RATING: 9
This is one of the best games I have found!  It can be a high spirited race, the dymamics are simple enough (and luck is prevelant enough) for family members down to 6 years old.  The rally rules allow deeper play, and a variety of tracks allows replaybility.  

The theme is very well represented with crashes, passes, and blown engines all contributing to the play.  There are add-0n cars you can use to paint and customize, and the advanced rules of building cars gives a depth that is rare in racing theme games. 

The down side is that some players can slow the game dramatically if they can't plan their move until they have the dice.  Also, bad play (or bad luck) is rewarded with early elimination.  Older track expansions are difficult to find and expensive.  

I have hand made Formula D components (including 2 maps) for the re-implemtation. This new edition has made the old Formula De obsolete.

A French F1 racing game of all things, Formula de is a delicious blend of luck, cajones, and strategy. The game rewards *smart* risk taking and planning. For such a simple system, the game does an admirable job of tackling Formula 1 racing with its fast straightaways to slow corners. Besides all that, rolling the big blue die is a blast.

After playing in an FD league, my rating for the game dropped from a 7 to a 5.  Three lap races take too long and anything less than that doesn't give those starting farther back on the grid enough time to made much of a move towards the front.

My first impression of this game was an old finnish boardgame called &quot;Ravipeli&quot;. After my so far only game, this didn&#039;t change. Even the gambling mechanism for moving is pretty much the same, except &quot;Ravipeli&quot; used multiple 1d6 dice. It also had similar system to FDs tyre points etc.

I admit it: I have a love-hate relationship with this game. It's amazingly simple in it's concept, and it is beautifully produced... it would be a perfect gameif it weren't for its rediculously large luck-factor, and some rules that are either unrealistic (like the "potential engine damage for every car in 5th or 6th gear when one player rolls a 19-20" rule) or inconsistent (you can keep playing when you lost all your tires or breaks, but you are out of the game when you lose your last engine point). Can I stop playing it though? Hrmph. Nope.

I like the game as of now, but I have a strong fear that it will follow much the same route as Battle Ball.  It's cute and dice heavy (although you can mitigate some of the luck).  Unfortunately, there really aren't a whole lot of meaningful decisions to make.  Almost every move is scripted, devolving it into an auto-pilot experience.  Even a one lap race lasts way longer than it should so you can really start to feel it after a while.  I don't know, it's hard to make a judgement as is...Rating will probably swing a point one way or the other with another play.

Description: Race around the track in your formula one car. Shift gears to roll higher dice, but be careful not to hit the walls in the turns.

Con: Ultimately a race game. Winner determined largely by random die rolls.

Wonderful game. I pulled it out for the first day with my normal gaming group and my soon-to-be wife. She loved it. Race cars are just her thing and she thought the game was great.

The game itself plays very well. The dice as gears work well in my opinion. The game gets fun when all of a sudden you have a ton of cars in a corner and you're going at top speed and have to figure out how to get through that turn without blowing up you and everyone else. What a blast!

RATING: 7
A fun race game that actually felt like a race and I felt packed more fun than Royal turf, Ave Caesar and Daytona 500 so the best race game I have played so far (for fun along with Carabande) but this is pretty subjective and even group dependant. 

Most decisions were a little too obvious but the option to take some risks was there and that added to the tension and fun. The scalabilty aspect is really appealing, probably best with about 5 or 6 but it played well with even 3, just not as much hoopla. While the lead can flip flop back and forth keeping everyone in the game it can easily be decided by the last dice roll so luck plays a big factor (although your decisions do too) and maybe best not to play more than one race so as not to wear out its welcome.

Fun but can be very slow to play - close packed cars can mean every gear change gets agonised over. Also suffers from runaway winners if played over 1 lap - but then that can be true in the real sport, I suppose. Even so, it doesn't necessarily mean it should be the case in a board game - it's all about the balancing!

It's tough to get a read on this game, since I don't feel like I've ever played a full game of it.  I've played it twice: once with 7 people, 1 car each, 1 lap.  The 2nd time was 4 people, 2 cars each, 1 lap.  I don't think the game was meant to be played with only 1 lap.  Luck is a much bigger factor when you don't need to worry about losing tires or fuel.  Probably won't be played much in our group.

I hate racing games. The only reason I played Formula Dé was because my friends made me ;) (and I play anything twice).

I know Formula Dé can be a good game with the right crowd. My friends seem to enjoy it a lot, but I find the game to be boring, tedious, way too long for what if offers and full of luck (die rolls seem to determine the winner). I know there are rules for a more strategic game, but I really don’t want to play the game again, so I won’t ever find out about the changes. On the basic level, the decisions are pretty easy and obvious.

With more than 5 players, the downtime is excessive for me.

The game´s components are very nice.

Bottom line, I won’t ever play this game again, however I know I’m an anomaly as every friend who has played the game has enjoyed it, so it must be a good game, it is just not a game for me.

A lot of fun.  Not very strategic, and if players decide to overanalyze a bit too long.  I normally push my car to the edge and crash, because what's the fun of sitting back in fourth?  The game has a serious first player advantage problem though -- probably to be played as more than a beer-and-pretzels game the starting positions need to be rotated and a full "series" played.  That's more time than I really want to devote to this game though.

A dicefest but I love it. I never win. Ever. Well..ok..once. I won once and I still thoroughly enjoy this game. My bad luck with dice is LEGENDARY in my circle of friends and family. Not only will I always roll too low to make it into a curve but I will ALWAYS roll precisely the number to put me in the spot just before the corner increasing my agony. I think that says something about this game if I'm am always the loser and always have bad luck with the game and still love to play it. 

I find that a lot of non-gamers tend to enjoy it, especially the ones who are fond of racing. The rules are very simple and the game is easily explained in a few minutes. I do, however, find the fun factor to be directly proportional to the amount of players. There is little chance of wreckage with just a few players so the more players you have the more challenge you will find in the game. More players also adds to the strategy available by adding more opportunities for blocking and for drafting. I highly recommend this one. 

It's a very light game and if you aren't fond of luck in your games you won't care for it, though.

Boring. I don't like games that simulate video games with tedious slowed-down decisions--why roll dice when a computer could do this "real time"?

I so want to love Formula De! Games with collectible maps are usually irresistible to me (see my map collections for Power Grid, Age of Steam, Steam, RR Tycoon, Age of Industry and so on!). However, game play is firmly entrenched in the "want to like more than I do" category.

I like thinking-person's race games that have the right balance of control and luck. The balance for Formula De falls too heavily on the luck-o-meter, especially given that a 2-3 lap game (why would you play less?) takes 2-3 hours. While there are decisions to make - on which gear should I hit the turn? should I take the damage to get the speed or save it for later? - these decisions all fall into the push-your-luck category and get a bit dull after a lap. But with only one lap, everything is push-it-to-the-max. It's a sprint. Deciding whether to pit stop is interesting, but that is strictly for long 3 lap games and is really only one decision.

I collected maps for this anyway, hoping I would grow to like it, but it never happened. Now that I have Rallyman - a race game with truly interesting and impactful decisions - I have decided to let my hopes of loving Formula De, and my map collection, go for good.

I found this game to be fun and exciting.  I like rolling dice and I think the way this game incorporates dice is a nice touch.  Some decisions to be made, but this game is mostly one of luck.  I would gladly play again, but I don’t think I would ever try to get it myself.  Not nearly as exciting as Pitchcar and there is too much of a chance for one of more players to have horrible luck and be out of the running.

I am not a fan of racing, I don't even think I have ever watched racing.  That having been said I don't find the theme off putting in anyway, it just doesn't make the game for me.  What's really cool about this game is the mechanics and how unbelievably fun it is to zoom around the track.  The gear system is genius, there are different dice for each gear and the higher the gear the lager the possible outcome of the roll.  They are not standard dice however, the D30 used for the highest gear has only the numbers 21-30.

It really does feel exciting to race around the track, and there is a huge emphasis on taking corners properly.  Most of the rules are very intuitive, and add to the simulation nature of the game.

I prefer playing this game with the rules from the mini version. They are less complicated and Euro-style than the full game. I'm not really interested in simulating racing so much as rolling the 6th gear die.

A great racing game. Better if you can get the expansions of the circuits. Each gear equals a different die. More luck factor than in Speed Circuit, but I prefer this one.

Racerbilspil. Supernemt og sjovt. Din bils gear er repræsentereret som terninger. Jo højere gear jo flere sider på terningen. F.eks. 6. gear er en 30 sidetterning. Nøj det går hurtigt. Men pas på i svingene, kører du for hurtigt, skrider du og din bil  kan eksplodere!

A good way too race in a safe way. Get other racetracks though and make a grand tour. Make tracks of your own. You can make the playing time from 30 minutes upto 3 hours by varying the number of pitstops and rounds to race.

All of the various boards look great and strongly contribute to the feel of the game. It's a die-rolling game in which luck often prevails, but the gear-die mechanic offers some probability optimization decisions and some risk-reward gambles. Not a deep game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's been fun to play every single time. My rating has dropped to a 7 only because I have played this game so many times.

The best racing game I have ever played but since I haven't played that many that may not be saying much. This has a real cool die system with a bigger die for the larger gears. There is also some resource management in the form of tires, fuel, engine etc., etc. there is also a good deal of strategy cornering and not taking damage. I am real glad I got this one.

RATING: 6
This is a racing game that treats speed in an interesting way, at least if you tend to abstract speed as distance travelled divided by time elapsed, as I think many of us have. In Formula Dé you could be zooming along side by side with another car, and on a particular turn the other one zips well into a curve while you drop behind a little - at which point the game decides you're the careening maniac who needs to be terminated pronto for the sake of distraught kittens everywhere. The game doesn't really care how fast you're going at any one time as long as you touch base properly in the corners, so "good driving" is technically about phase and momentum, which are maintained by rolling well. In fact it can be counter-thematically correct to accelerate into a tricky corner, since if you downshift because you're unlikely to reach it in your current gear, you could find yourself playing out Zeno's dichotomy paradox, each failed roll even worse than a wasted turn. And yet, at times it really does feel like Formula 1 in a way.

Car and lap counts are determined by a balance between various factors. With less than six cars it won't seem like F1, but with ten it could take you forever. One lap doesn't give you a fair chance to catch up from the back of the grid, but three will take too long and be too deadly.

I figure that similarly to Blood Bowl and some other games, this one is best enjoyed playing a full season of races on a variety of maps with dedicated players, maybe three to five playing two cars each. You know, if organizing and maintaining such a thing was actually possible. This is not to say there might not be entertainment to be had in a one-off race, but people say games can easily take three hours and there'll be much randomness along the way. For solo play at least there's the Java game which does an excellent job of managing the rolling and counting for you, not to mention it offers credible opponents who don't mind if you just start over after you turn your vehicle into a car-shaped pile of ashes in the second corner.

A friend of mine owned this one.  We only played this twice, and had a good time on both occasions despite the fact that none of us are particularly interested in auto racing.  My son (7) managed a close win in our 2nd race, which was on the Suzuka course.  I finished 3rd, only because a car ahead of me crashed just short of finish due to bumping the winner!

After our good experience, we purchased a copy of the game for ourselves (along with the USA #1 track set).

RATING: 6
It's very nice to have a game that supports lots of players and is fairly easy to pick up. It's a lot of fun and has a nice balance of luck and skill - unfortunately it may take a game or two to realize some of the tactics (when to use tire or brake points, for example). There is a slight, but not fulminant, follow-the-leader issue.

There can be problems with analysis paralysis - sometimes a player will take a _long_ time deciding what course of action to take. A sand-timer might be useful. The game can also go on for awhile - the large size of the boards can make a game last for 2 hours (or more!). Because this is, at its heart, a racing game, that can really detract from the idea that a racing game should be, well, FAST. (This is absolutely not the only racing game with this problem - most of them do!)

RATING: 8.2
I've surveyed a lot of different race games now.  I have to say that Formula De has done much right.  Inevitably every group tweaks the rules (us included).  But the core system is vibrant enough to have fun, and resilient enought to stand up to the tweak du jour in play.  I've probably played more Formula De than any other modern eurogame.  I still look forward to more plays, and especially like the linked series we conduct.  I recommend you play teams of 2 cars with up to 5 players.  A season of events adds a lot of drama.

Try it, you'll like it!

I own several expansion tracks for this game.  I think to really enjoy this game you need at least 6-8 tracks to compete upon.  The variety really extends the enjoyment of the game.

2-3 hour game of modest strategy.  We love it for the role-playing and the positional racing elements.

On permanent loan to a friend.

A short way of describing this one is as "A game of goose on steroids". Basically, it's a themed roll & move game with some additional elements that add complexity.

Despite having a certain degree of control over the dice rolls, the more I've played the game the less I've enjoyed it. Having played more tight and better designed racing games hasn't helped this one much, either.

It was one of the very first games I played, and back then I enjoyed it quite a lot, so I guess it's a good game to play with non-gamers.

Surprisingly I think this could be a lot of fun. I stayed away from it but after reading playing sessions and reviews I think I may give this a shot.

Update after 2 one lap races basic rules 4 player.Have to try this game with more players or more cars and with advanced rules. More rounds also...This is too luck driven with four players and basic rules. Poleposition and second place won. Very hard to catch up since the first two position end up perfect in turn one while the others fall just short. 
This is actually what happens in a lot of formaula one races. But it is not really fun, if you are behind.

Funny ,simple,fast and a lot of circuits available,I really feel to drive a car when I play this game,I think it's far better than Bolide,too much vectorial and calculation,this game has calculation but even trajectories and using them in the right manner is key in winning more than good dice throwing...

With the addition of tournament rules and a way to upgrade your car (ala Blood Bowl) it would be a 10. Seems like a lot of time investment to be over with just the one game. Overall, the concepts of separating the type of corners/turns to reflect driving difficulty, balances the dice. The varying dice also adds a level of thrill that is unlike anything else. Love this game and always will.

This game has great re-play value and although i haven't played a thee lap game i could see the tactic that would be required. Naming your cars is very important! I cannot stress this enough, a named car will beat a unnamed car only 1 in 5 times!!! I personally use Hot Roddimus Prime and Starscream. Speed Racer usually beats me though. Bastard!

In its simplest form this is a roll and move.  I know that this can be a very involved game or just some fun on a Sunday afternoon.  I wish the maps were not so expensive and that Eurogames or Asmodee (whoever has teh right now) would reprint them as I will just go make my own at the local Kinkos rather then pay 80 dollars a map.

RATING: 6
Formula Dull!  I realize I'm in the minority on this one, but I just don't get the appeal of this game.  I don't mind dice in a game, but it seems like that is all there is to this one.  It takes too long to play if it's more than one lap, but there is not enough opportunity for real decisions in just one lap.  Easily one of the most overrated games.

Great game with any size group.  Helps if you are a racing fan, but not neccessary at all.  Nice light game to play with friends.  It can bog down a bit on some tracks but the gameplay is good and the quality of the components is great.  Too bad it's so freakin' expensive right now until the new edition comes out.  Pick up any old tracks you can find while you can because the new ones are not based on real life counterparts.

RATING: 9
One of the funniest, best flavored games of all. Lots of dice rolling and dumb luck ... but hey - you get to drive a race car!

Optimum play is: 5 players with two cars, (and two beers) each.
If you don't settle the start positions with time laps (and who has time for that??), roll them, but place only one car each - the second car is placed to mirror the first (ie. if I roll pole position with one car, then I get tail with the other). It's much more fun to have a car in the back fighting with three others in every corner, than to have two lone riders in the far front with no interaction.

The only downside is the playing time. 3 hours is a lot.

I play this game in the form of a championship with the family and the winner gets... a trophy and F1 hat !

This game has just too much dice throwing for my taste. The quantity of available tracks is impressive, and the planning of which gear to use is also interesting, but each lap takes too long to end (more than 30 minutes, depending on number of players) and there's no fun in playing only one lap. There are some strange, random rules as well. Maybe I would enjoy this game better with a revision of the rules and on shorter tracks.

Formula Dé is a fast-paced racing game in which the cars' top speeds are limited by having to end a certain number of turns in each curve of the racetrack. This can be tricky, because although players can regulate their speeds by choosing which gear to be in and each gear allows a certain range of movement, the exact amount is determined randomly. Great fun for a big group.

Not played 2nd edition (multiple dice).  Thoroughly recommend (1st edition) playing variant where you can choose to roll 1d20 or 2d10, and allowing an extra space of movement for an engine wear - seems to me to reduce luck element to a manageable element rather than an overriding force!

You can try to strike a balance between speed and safety, but this game is almost all about assessing probabilities and hoping for the best. You can also be nasty and block the path of another player, possibly killing them. Even so, it's too luck-dependent for my taste.

RATING: 7
Just enough strategy to keep it interesting. One of the few games that continually invokes a feel of being out of it and then has a major change in placement at the end of the game. For 2-3 players, I prefer playing with two cars each. It does slow down the game, but makes it far more interesting for me.

This game gets better with practice.  You really start understanding how Risk Management and pressing your luck are important aspects of this game.

I just enjoy this game more and more with each play.  It has so much to offer, it can be as easy or as complex as you want it and no race is ever the same. - Must get more tracks.

After getting more tracks, I continue to love it.  The last game was the most fun I've had.  I didn't even care if I won or lost I was having so much fun regardless. I don't know of too many games that I truelly feel like that.  Most I want to win and try to have fun regardless.

Count the squares, roll, move, count the squares, roll, move.  At least that&#039;s how it ended up being played in my group.  Most of us were too conservative to use up tire and gas points, so the game ended up being a little dry.  I suppose it would be better if we took more risks, but certain members of the group [errenceTay] hated it so much that I doubt it&#039;ll ever get played again. I prefer The Really Nasty Horseracing Game to this one.  There&#039;s more player interaction and chances to screw your neighbor in the Horseracing game than in this one.

It's a great group game. For a year, We played a full season with most of the tracks available for us.  Personnaly, I have maybe played a bit too much of it, and maybe my group wasn't playing fast enough.  In our group, everyone tend to play on everyone else turn, hence the "formula dé" syndrom when we try to help a fellow gamer that makes a mistake that could be alleviate.

Edit 2009 : I tried it with other gamers and the flow was much more smooth.  Great game when it doesn't overstay it's welcome.

Wow! I managed to find someone who had this in stock for a more reasonable price than ebay second-hand (ebay is such a rip-off). Shame I have one duplicated track in Monaco, but it was worth it for the extra set of dice and the second track.

I'm hoping that, with Formula D, there will be a re-issue of all the old tracks, though I'm a bit worried that this might stretch to double the number of boards issued because there will be one "serious" track on the "A" side of the board, and one "arcade racer" track on the "B" side. Whilst I'm happy to have as many tracks as possible to add interest to the game, I prefer the F1-style racing without all the stupid "chrome" of the street racing. True, I can always ignore the chrome and treat the street track as an ordinary circuit, but it doesn't quite feel the same as racing around a representation of a track that features in the F1 calendar.

Aprovechando la moda del automovilismo en España, este juego de los años 90 está volviendo a tener auge. Aunque el juego estéticamente es muy de los 90, recrea la competición de bólidos en la Fórmula 1 con todas las posibilidades que esto conlleva: torneos, escuderías, reglas de pilotos... El juego es muy sencillo. Demasiado sencillo. Es más, creo que el factor suerte es muy determinante. Basta decir que el movimiento del coche depende de las tiradas en los dados. Eso sí, cada jugador debe arriesgar y decidir con qué marcha entra en cada curva. El coche dispone de 6 marchas y solo podemos subir de marcha de 1 en 1 en cada ronda. Es decir, al principio de mi turno, decido si subo 1 marcha, mantengo la actual o reduzco. Según la marcha que lleve tendré que tirar un tipo de dado que me permitirá saber de primeras el número mínimo que puedo sacar o el máximo (hay dados de 4, 6, 8, 12 o incluso 30 caras!!). Ojo, que cada dado es especial, ya que los resultados del dado no son los convencionales. Los resultados comprenden los mínimos y máximos espacios de avance contemplados en el juego. Cada curva del tablero lleva una indicación de las paradas que debemos hacer sin pasarnos. Por ejemplo, si en la primera curva del circuito marca un 2, significa que debemos de acabar nuestro movimiento en el área roja que delimita la curva durante 2 turnos. Teniendo en cuenta que las casillas que movemos las marca la tirada de dado, hay que saber cuando arriesgarse y cuando no para cumplir los límites del trazado. Pasarse puede suponer desgaste de los neumáticos o frenos (disponemos de unos cuantos límitados para la carrera). En caso de que nos pasemos muy de largo o no nos queden, la ostia es inevitable. También podemos elegir los trazados de las curvas, hacer adelantamientos, aprovechar los coches de delante para ir a rebufo, reventar el motor, tener "toques" con otros coches cuando nos encontramos al lado de ellos...
En fin, el juego está muy bien representado. Además los circuitos son bastante fidedignos. Y hay reglas para entrar en boxes, organizar mundiales, etc... Un juego sencillo, ameno, nada pesado y que podría ser un buen colofón de cada una de nuestras quedadas lúdicas para organizar un minicampeonato.
De momento este no me lo compro. Más que nada porque Asmodeé (la empresa francesa del juego) hace un par de meses que anunció una reedición del juego. Es cuestión de esperar si la edición actual vieja baja de precio o la nueva está mucho más mejorada para saber a cual recurrir.

I enjoyed my one play of this, although it went longer than I would have liked given the amount of decisions it offered. It is probably best with all the rules in play, although that also means lengthening the game to allow for multiple laps and pit stops.

Not a bad little game, and one of few options to support 10 players (although I'd grab Saboteur before Formula De with 10).

Would be better if it played a little quicker (downtime is excessive, particularly with more players).

A fun little romp.

Sometimes there is excitement, but mostly it is tedious.  Strategy gets overwhelmed by dice rolls.  Also, not a very good simulation of racing.  The mechanic for the turns actually prevents you from following the ideal path through turns except in cases of great luck (and then only on 1-stop turns).

The game mechanics in this game try to recreate racing situations, but the details of the mechanics live in their own little reality. Go is about surrounding territories, so that's what you do. Formula Dé is about racing cars with control down to the inch as cars try to take optimal paths through turns ... but the mechanics make it impossible to take the best path through turns and the variation in dice rolls can be as much as half of a straightaway. The drafting rules don't speed up the car in front. The engine burnout rules make your car more likely to fail when other cars are using the same gear. Instant stopping at pit stops is laughable. The compression ratio of laps ensures that any other rule in the game is debatable at one of the scales.

(While all of these things annoy me, they don't affect my enjoyment of Formula Dé as an abstract game -- the relatively small number of interesting decisions per game is the reason that I don't like to play it.)

Game about calculating risk, managing risk, and figuring out risk. I find the process of calculating the odds of landing here or there depending on this or that die to be very, very tedious. This could be fun on a computer, but then that would remove any kind of decision-making. Lots of downtime while other players are busy calculating their odds and risk/reward scenarios. Good idea, but really not my cup of tea.

Fun.  Yes, roll and move, but there's plenty of decision making and tension.  The only knock is that it's a little long.  One lap isn't gratifying enough, but two laps is two hours with ten cars.

Easy to learn with a great gear mechanic.  Cool over sized board.  

Even someone who doesn't care about racing in the "real world" of any kind (*me*) can have a blast with this game.

The new version does not interest me (what is with that artwork?).  

I could rate this higher but the 3 lap races just take soooo long.  The two lap race with some advanced rules is a happy medium, but three laps is the best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I rate this game anywhere from a three to a ten (8 overall) depending on the number of players. Although Formula De can be played with two people, with only one competitor you'll probably have more fun playing Guess Who? than this. The game is really the most fun with five or more players. It's fun trying to squeeze your way into a turn when your path is nearly completely blocked, or trying to just finish a race when you've used all your tire and brake points.

This game is great for two reasons.  For one, you can play with ten players, and it's still fun.  It's also very easy, and the theme is such that you can convince just about anybody to give it a try.  A great party game, and a great intro game.

If I want a racing game, I'd probably prefer [boardgame=38054][/boardgame], but that's a big "if." You can dress it up with a little resource management and dice selection, but this is still basically a good old roll-and-move dice fest in which I have little interest. There are some counting skills required too. I almost spun out on purpose to exit myself from the game.

Thematically a lot of fun, and you get to build your own car.  The only issues are that crashing and burning half way through lap one is no fun (even if horribly rare), when you get a large group of racers it winds up being kind of slow, and the dice rolls do add a fair bit of randomness.

*bump* hey get out of my way.  How did you shoot ahead of me.  Your taking that turn awfully fast aren't you?-well you have to win somehow, it's a race after all.  This is a great game for the racing fan.  Play works pretty close to real racing strategy and is great fun for large groups.

A extremely boring game! I managed to fall a sleep between each time it was my turn to roll the dice so I could move one of my cars. A painfull experience! The gearshift mechanism is kind of a good idea, but it doesn't exactly require much brainwork to figure it out. And then it is all down to dice rolling. The one and only good thing about this game is the dices though. Good looking dices. Sadly you have to roll them to much so it is easy to get tired of them...

Formula De has a lot of strong qualities.  It plays with a large number of players, it is very thematic, and it has a good balance of planning and luck.  There are a lot, and I mean a lot, of tracks to race on, and the potential for season or career play is really great.

If you aren't playing a season, though, there are some things that can be frustrating.  Because the game is dice based, there are times when a player gets out to an insurmountable lead, or a player drops so far behind that they can't win.  Also, unless you are very diligent about making people take their move quickly, the game can take a long time.  Overall, this is a good game for a large group or a dedicated bunch of people looking for a more persisten game, but it probably isn't the best choice for a typical group.

On a race track, players race cars by making decisions on which gear to select. Number of hexes you move is determined by a die roll dependent on the gear you are on. You are allowed a certain number of tire, fuel, brakes, engine and body work hits (depending on how you take corners, land adjacent to other cars, etc). I'm not a huge racing game fan, but there is a fair amount of luck with the die rolls. It's okay, and can support a large number of players.

The best racing-sim out there that's not on a computer.  I drive the real thing - and this game, although dice-based, recreates a lot of the same strategies that you have out on the real track.  The Basic rules and 1-lap games are fairly light and dice-driven.  The Advanced rules and 2+ lap games are much more strategic and more enjoyable IMHO (although some people go TOTALLY overboard with this game - I think 3 or 4 laps is the longest you can enjoy it in one sitting).

Never was sure about racing games, so I have never taken the time to play one.  I'm glad that I had a chance to try this one out.  Wow, fun.  Really gave me the feeling of ripping around the corners, bumping into other cars, and slipstreaming other cars.  This one is fun.  Sure there is a random element, in fact a strong one, but it is somewhat controlled by changing gears, and using the car's ability to alter the effects of the dice (some).

Formula De still strikes me as my favorite racing game. The three-lap race is the way to go. You get to customize your car to your play style, so you have much more control over how you play. There is plenty of planning to do in deciding how much risk to take in the turns, and the uncertainty of the dice keeps it interesting and adds tension. The only problem is a full three lap race can take a while, so it's hard to get a game out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lots of dice rolling is fun. Game is a decent "simulation" of a Formula 1 race. I have never tried with expert rules, it might be a fun (and maybe long) experience. You really need to have 6+ cars on track. I think you should play with 3-5 players with 2 cars each to have most fun experience. Problem there is that game starts to take a long time if you play more than one lap and if you don't then you miss pitstops altogether.

It's fun to play every now and then but sold my copy because there wasn't anyone willing to play it because of time it takes to play.

Great racing game. It's simple, but cool. And the kids enjoy racing their cars and rolling the dice. Any game that my 5 year old can play and I can enjoy playing it with her scores well in my book.
UPDATE: I much prefer the computer version of this game because it eliminates ALL of the time-wasting counting that occurs in this game.

I really, really like racing games and this is a fun one.  The dynamic tension is created with the dice.  It's not rocket science to figure what you need to get through the corners, it's whether you risk the dice gremlins granting what you need :)

It was actually this boardgame which got me into watching F1 racing and not the other way around.  I bought the pewter set of F1 cars and have painted these to represent the current F1 teams.  Formula De is a great game that unfortunately I've only played as a two and three player game (2 cars each).  Lots of fun and I can't wait to play with more players.

The ultimate racing game! It is so like the real thing! The makers took great care to recreate the race tracks from around the world. This game is still played even with the new Formula D reprint, because the old tracks are still perfectly playable!

We played this as a "2 car each" league for a couple of years and had an excellent time, adding in a bunch of variants to increase the complexity and strategy. For a standalone race, I don't think the game is that great - determine the probabilities, assess the risk, roll, get lucky or not.

RATING: 10
By far My favorite Racing game. It took me 2-3 games to really appreciate the design as much as i do now, but now i love it! You have to play 3 tracks and use the advanced rules (at least the cardesign and pitstop rules, i never played qualifying though) - with the simple rules and only 1 track the dice detemine the winner. With the full monty though, it is a very, very tactical game!

RATING: 6
Admittedly on only one play, seemed a little 'scripted' - once one player was in the lead their decisions seemed obvious and attempts by the rest to take risks and thus catch up proved fruitless. Perhaps multi-lap races, or, if you have them, a season of different tracks would give it more appeal (I'm not a huge fan of F1 and this may also have had a bearing).

A well done racing game that is accessible to new gamers.  Fun to play and reasonably quick with a lot of options in terms of tracks (if you can get your hands on 'em).  You can even enjoy blowing your car to smithereens.

Experiences are going to vary with the track that's used, which is both good and bad.  Players tend to have a bias toward tracks that let you roll 6th gear, which is both understandable and regrettable since the more technical tracks can be just as much fun.

Good, fun game.  Dice-heavy but there are still decisions to be made.  Plays somewhat slow, especially in multi-lap races which is when some other aspects of the game become more interesting.

RATING: 4
Not for everyone (non-race fans don't seem to "get it" when I have introduced it to them), it is nevertheless a fun, graphically appealing game. There is a heavy dependance on chance on each turn, but over the course of a race this can be minimized with good play, and the best players will win more frequently.

12/11/05: if you are not into racing you will not get this game. That's my conclusion after trying hard to introduce this gamers, and getting a very neutral reaction. None of them know much or care about racing.

2/2010: Have lost my interest in F-1 racing, find myself not playing this much anymore.

TRY Apr/04: Seemed like lots of bookkeeping and no chance to catch the leader (meaning -- I dislike that the big gear has NO overlap with the gear lower!).  I imagine different tracks might produce a different feel, as would the advanced rules (potentially), multiple laps, etc.

Excellent board, fun game, high luck factor with rolling dice every move, but over the course of the game it would seem to even out for everyone.  Some skill in picking the best traffic lanes and how to approach the corners with the appropriate gears and pacing.  I'm not sure yet how it compares to Avalon-Hill's excellent "Speed Circuit" and "Le Mans" but I definitely plan to play it more.  Have played the Monza, Elkhart Lake (WI), and Indianapolis boards.

This game is a love it or hate it type.  The girls in our group don't like it, and none of the guys are that into it except for Dan and me.  If there were more enthusiasm for it I think I'd get into it more, but now my enthusiasm is waning.  It can really drag if you can't get your car (or cars) anywhere near the front.  Also, it's not so fun with a lot of people, more fun with 2 cars each.  Lots of pushing your luck to it - diehard strategists will hate this game.  Never played with the Advanced rules, as they seem too fiddly and took too long.

Here is why 

1. It is the best racing theme game I have played to date.= Best of its kind.

2. It has two levels the basic game which is a blast to play. And a longer advanced game with multiple laps, weather conditions, pit-stops, tire types,drafting and so on.

3. This game can be taught faster to new gamers then Mark Martin's pit crew can change his tires.

4. This game is fun with two players (each runs two cars) and goes all the way up to somethink like 10 players

5. Great expansion boards with fun art.

RATING: 5
The biggest plus point of the this game is that it's suitable for a large group.  It's a bit dull unfortunately and there are a couple of flaws in the rules that could easily be fixed with just a couple of basic house-rule tweaks.  However, it's too dull to actually bother to go to the effort on its behalf...

A fun press your luck beer and pretzels type game.  My only problem is that it seems too long.  It is more interesting with two cars per player and five players.  Two laps is of course necessary to allow for a pit stop.  It just seems too long that way, but that setup is usually what I've played and seems the most right based on rules.  Maybe the tracks are too big?  Maybe 10 cars too many?

I've played enough of this game that i'd definately like to rate it.  Its unique in my collection that it is a race game.  It is dice-heavy.  I'm not keen on the chequebook-style racing sheets that are used.. Would rather see a 'dashboard' al-a 'Formula One'.  Good laminate options on BGG for download, though.  I'd like to play it again, but I think that many other games will hit the table first.  Oh yeah, proprietary dice here.. don't lose any dice.

(original comments follow)
Ah I just bought the damn thing.

Purchased on Ebay, June 23rd.  Arrived, July 4th.

When it arrived I had to play a quick track.. Initial thoughts:

1)  Huge board, tiny cars ..?
2)  Overshot alot of turns - gearing down is essential, esp when in doubt.
3)  Funny dice.. Better not lose one.  I thought I was reading wrong when it said, 'D6, 2-4', but the D6 really has only #s 2-4.  Yeah, don't lose those.
4)  If I really like this, I'll be buyin tracks!

Update:  I didn't play it, so I traded it.  I'm sure the new owner will enjoy the game more than I would (can).

I placed an order for 5 sets of dice over 2 1/2 years ago with Funagain Games(don't use these guys btw).  They were "in stock" when I made my order at 6.95, but of course since Funagain Games keeps such crapy track of their products they were soon out of order.  So there my order sat in limbo.  Until today I received a email indicating my order status was changed to "completed" even though my order wasn't fufilled.  Then when I searched their site to see if they are still offering the Formula De dice I see they are now charging 8.95 for a "bagged" edition!  So it looks like it's a good ole "bait and switch" routine.

15 years ago this game would have been fun but with the Xbox and the PS2 these racing games just don&#039;t appeal to me.  FD is too slow with too little strategy/control to justify the time.

I may have been spoiled by the new generation of racing games (Powerboats, Snow Tails, Flussfieber) but Formula Dé seemed extremely tedious. The range of values on the dice are so huge and their distributions so flat that it seemed almost impossible to plan ahead.

Very playable racing game that isn't so much strategic as it is a reasonable reflection on auto racing. (My son thinks it is too luck dependent.)

The same decisions and actions are repeated giving a sameness to every track and every race. 1 lap races are long enough for most players although I would always be in for a 2nd lap to more fully shake out the pack (1st is often long gone).

Play for the social fun.

Game length varies according to how many laps you want to run. We played 4 players with 2 players using multiple cars and a single lap took 30-40 minutes. With experience I imagine the time would decrease as players became quicker at deciding what to do.

RATING: 9
Raised my rating a point after some added house rules. Having a 30 second time limit to move and not allowing people to sit and count out spaces seems like it's a must and makes this game really fun and engaging.

2011 Update: Played in a league this past summer. Fantastic, except when I wreck 1/4 of the way in the first lap. We cranked out a time trial and two 3-lap races in under 3 hours. With 7-8 players. This game does not drag at all if people are there to play.

Having played in both a league, and now several one-off games, I think this game is a 10 when played in a league format and probably a 6 elsewise.

When buying this version, the shopkeeper was strangely silent. I know now, it was because the newer, in some ways, better version was for sale online and at different stores.
I have the metal cars now! Pics in gallery.

Why I purchased: Racing! Cool mini's! Simple for friends! Fun!
Where purchased: FLGS, car mini's from a BGG'er

Neat, fun game that my friends will stay still long enough to learn. Lots of flavor and fans make this a winner.

Despite its popularity, this game is really not my cup of tea. I found it too fiddly, with all the counting all the time and too luck-driven as compared to other, slicker racing games (such as Ave Caesar). I am not into motorsports, so the theme really puts me off.

RATING: 7
The game is simple yet has captured the feel for Grand Prix racing.  You start by changing gears one gear at a time going up.  You roll a "x" sided die based on the gear you are in.  The higher the gear the higher the numbered die.  Your car is required to stop at least once within a curve or your car takes some form of wear.  Trying to multi gear down for a turn will cause wear.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Top fun and not particularly taxing either makes this a good game for everybody. Different dice for different gears is a neat idea and you have to balance speed v car damage as you try and pace yourself through the corners. I haven't worked out if there is much skill in the game, but I know I will always enjoy a game of Formula De.

E' stato il mio primo gioco da tavolo che ho comprato a un'età adulta. Sarà per via del fatto che è il miglior gioco di corse che ho mai provato e la grande varietà di circuiti (plance bellissime) a disposizione (tutti realmente esistenti, ad eccezione di quello speciale per i 10 Anni), per me è veramente bello. Con regole semplici che riescono a simulare il comportamento delle macchine e l'emozione della guida. Bella l'idea delle marce con i differenti dadi. Dadi che influenzano senza dubbio, moltissimo l'andamento della gara, ma occorre la giusta strategia matematica e calcolo delle probabilità per gestirli al meglio. Va giocato almeno in 4-5... in 6-7 e' DIVERTENTISSIMO... in 8-10 e' SUPERBO!!! Un gioco ormai epico! Uno dei miei preferiti. Un must per chi ama la Formula 1. Le espansioni ovviamente sono NECESSARIE per fare dei campionati tra amici.

1. MONACO (MONTECARLO)											8 
Uno dei più lenti e convulsi circuiti. Un tracciato cittadino che merita la sua reputazione, una disposizione sensazionale, con i suoi momenti di bravura e le sue trappole. Nessun errore è in genere permesso senza che ciò sia inevitabilmente sancito! Cosa che ne fa un tracciato pieno di emozioni. Per quanto riguarda la strategia, bisogna tenere conto del fatto che la corsa in gruppo è molto frequente, il resto è più o meno sollecitato, a seconda degli eventi in corsa, ma è bene equilibrare l'automobile, di gestire il consumo di carburante ed i suoi pneumatici per tentare di non fermarsi ai box, questa tattica permette di guadagnare un tempo prezioso. In griglia, partire in prima fila può essere molto vantaggioso per prendere la testa molto rapidamente. Infine, il tempo può svolgere un ruolo molto perturbatore in corsa, che rende le condizioni di tracciato sotto la pioggia ancora più precarie.

2. NEDERLAND (ZANDVOORT 1)										6
Questo tracciato è piuttosto rapido, 5a marcia in media, con passaggi in 4a per alcune curve. In breve, oltre a motori molto sollecitati, pochi pericoli. Anche il consumo di carburante, di solito necessario su qualsiasi tipo di circuito, non è importante. Il posto sulla griglia ha poca importanza.

I never thought I would like a racing game.  I lost terribly, but only because I played very poorly until I caught on to the rules.  Solid game mechanics, though. If I can manage to do better at the game the next time out, I might bump up my score.

Although it's a "Roll and Move" game i don't think the dice detract from the game, as a good player can definitely make the difference!
A huge amount of extra tracks adds to it replay value.

RATING: 5.25
An enjoyable racing game.  I don't really have anything to compare this with since it was my first racing game.  It appeared to suffer from an early leader with some timely good luck being nearly impossible to catch baring an offsetting bout of timely bad luck.  It was fun, but it seemed to get repetitive fairly quickly.  Too much of the basic game is determined by initial pole position (a random die roll hours before the game ends).  This game is awesome if you're a huge car racing fan (I'm not).

Lots of luck in this game, but with plenty of opportunities to manage your luck. If you have fewer than six players, each can (and should) run multiple cars. This helps to even out the luck and also helps keep all players in the game, which is important because cars can be eliminated. (I hear that the real enthusiasts have leagues and track standings over a "season" of a dozen or more games, but I don't think I'll be getting into that!) The basic game comes with two tracks for variety, and expansion boards are also available.

good game for all.  easy to learn.  played with 5 non-gamers.  all really liked it.  Just has a fun factor for new players, however, it has shown it's age a little when it comes to racing games.  A not too serious game where die rolls can hinder you even no matter if you play aggressive or conservative.  Also it's a little long for what it is if you play two rounds or more.    This game has a soft spot for me and plays best with lots of people.

It took me quite a while to obtain a copy of Formula De.  It's been out of print for a while.  New printing was supposed to be out in a month or so, but I wanted it for Christmas and didn't trust that it really would be available in time.

Thanks to Christopher for working with me on the sale.

I've really enjoyed this one.  Rules aren't too much for my wife (who doesn't like "complicated rules") and my 4 year-old son.  Cars are tiny, but if they were any bigger the board would have to be huge.  I think there's a nice combo of luck and skill involved.  Luck is an important part of the equation when you want your 4 year-old to be able to compete.

If you think you'd like it and you can get your hands on one, I'd say go for it for sure.

RATING: 6.5
This should be, and can be, a light fun racing game; but for such a dice heavy game there is a lot of analyzing, counting, number crunching and artificial "gamey" maneuvering to try to counter the dice. I really dislike the turn mechanics where cars will swerve through turns erratically and unrealistically- trying to find the longest route to satisfy the number of stops a turn requires. I also feel there is too much variance with some of the larger dice, and I don't like the player elimination aspect to the game.

It is fun trying to position yourself into a place on the board where your next dice roll or two will give you the greatest shot at a good position. And there is something about rolling the huge blue dice which is very satisfying. But there is just too much downtime, especially when you get a lot of people in the game and everyone spends their turns counting, recounting, formulating, counting again, etc... As with any pure dice-driven game, if you don't roll well you will not win- regardless of how well you plan ahead. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It catches the mood of a F1 race, but it's too long, becaming a bit boring sometimes. Luck has a strong impact to the game, but you can drive it a little. I'd preferred there was more circuits with the game; that would have raised my rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Initially had mixed thoughts on the game...fun racing game, but better with more which in turn would make it longer and less attractive game.  But like any long game - time needs to be set aside to enjoy it.  If time is short, a shorter race (or FD Mini) is a good compromise.  But this is a seductive game...first few plays might leave you cold, but the game is infectious in that I enjoy going back to it.  The depth added without much overhead by the advanced rules is what elevates this game.  Customizing your car in combination with gear choices tips this game to one where one is actively managing luck.  With a relatively simple ruleset, the cars race stretch out on the straights, bunch up in the curves is a reasonably approximation of circuit racing.  A full 3 lap race is long, but the game can be fun even at 1 (or 2) laps.

[b]Unique Component[/b] - Different sided dice as car gears


[b]Unique Mechanic[/b] -  Each increasingly sided dice represents the increasing gears of your race car.  Lower gears have fewer sided dice which equals slower movement of your car.  High gears have higher sided dice which equals faster movement.  Players can choose their dice/gear but then must move the rolled number of spaces.


[b]Quick Thoughts[/b] - This is one of the best racing games ever created.  It allows for 10 players.  The rules are extremely easy and play is simple.  Yet it still offers excellent racing strategy.  It had full Formula 1 licensing so all the real tracks were represented.  




One of my favorites.  Easily my favorite racing game.  I am trying to get all the tracks.  Better to be played as a full season to truly enjoy.  And with as many cars on the track as possible.

Nice game that suffers from it's lenght. You need to have qualifications and a 2-3 lap contest to really get everything out of this game, but by that time it's taken so long you start to feel indifferent to who's winning. Too long, and the pace is a bit slow. The cars are supposed to race 200mph, but it takes ten minutes to see them clear a corner.

However, the true way to judge the merits of a racing game are to see if "the crowd is into it" and every game I have played the "crowd goes wild". Two thumbs up to this classic, I hope our group actually paints our miniatures someday.

I still prefer Pitstop, mainly for the modular board.  Could stand to have the luck elements reduced slightly.  What about a street-racing version with more customization and bump-n-grind? [EDIT: ka-ching!  Where're my royalties??]

Not a racing sim, but fun.  Somewhat luck driven (&quot;dice rolling contest&quot; according to those who can&#039;t roll to save their lives), there&#039;s plenty of opportunity to profit from calculated risks, and the game has all sorts of options to liven things up even more.

Rating is for new edition.

Asmodee have not only blinged up the new Formula De, they have also ameritrashed it.

You can play standard rules (no change from previous edition) or you can play with a whole host of special characters and rules. These are inspired by Fast and Furious no doubt. There's weather, there's snipers, there's bonuses for speeding past police stations...

The graphics and new player 'gear boxes' are amazing. The package is a whole heap of fun with lots of room to customise races, cars and characters. Sure, there's player elimination but once expansions get released, there's no reason why the eliminated players can just start another race!

This is one of the most boring games I have ever played. You make an easy decision, roll a die and move your car. Then you wait for everyone else to do the same until it is your turn to... guess what... exactly... roll a die. If that would not be bad enough, the game is EXTREMELY slow. To play all the 19 laps take forever and ever. Avoid this boring dicefest!

I was introduced to this game in 2004  or 2005 at Gencon  while waiting to play in the Settlers of catan tournament  
For two days I watched them play on giant blown up maps. Then decided to play myself.  Two catan tournaments $20. Formula De $3.  I just sneaked in to qualify for Saturday's playoff games.  Awesome time.  I qualified for Sunday and found myself starting 9th. In Sunday's championship race. With two turns to go I put it in high gear and rolled a 30. Overtaking the leader. Good and bad.  It left me with a d8. And an 8 would blow up my car.  7 I would spin out. I rolled an 8.  :(.  But damn it was a fun ride.  
And is what brought me to boardgaming 
More than Settlers of Catan. 

I've made metal car sheets (4) with magnetic pieces to attach to it.  

I can send pics.  Someday I'll post em up.

Only reason on my trade list is that I have the new version. and 10 extra painted cars.  
I don't think I'll every have 10 people to play it :(

Or 30.

I think it was the 6 gear-dice that made me love this game, so it's just as well I didn't start out with an earlier edition.  As an added bonus, the extra tracks have provided a welcome outlet for all the money burning holes in my pockets.

Fun, but I think you need a houserule that you cannot count out spaces before you roll. And that once you point to a space or move your car into it, you can't take it back. (Otherwise it's a long tedium of people counting out several routes, then forgetting where the previous ones stopped, etc.)

RATING: 7
Dice-based racing game.  Much of the game is in press-your-luck and probability calculation, but it's still entertaining to see if you can make it through windy turns.    I was happy to play a single lap, as I think three laps would drag it out way too long.

RATING: 5
A roll-and-move car racing game with a bazillion expansion tracks.

Tracks have variable numbers of lanes and turns. Cars can take hits on their tires, brakes, fuel, engines, or body. There are 6 gears, each associated with a different modified (i.e., not usual distribution) die (d4 --> d30). Players start in 1st gear and can shift up or down 1 gear each turn for free. Each turn requires 1-3 stops; may skip 1 of these and take damage to tires (skipping >1 --> car explodes). Brakes are used to slow down and to downshift quickly, gas to downshift quickly, engines to downshift very quickly. If you take maximum damage in any of these, your car explodes. You can take 1 pitstop (typical 2 or 3 lap race), where tires are replaced. 

There are a lot of extra rules about passing, lane changes, slipstreaming ... and even weather. Lots of complexity, but a LOT of dice: rolloff for pole position; roll every turn for movement; if you end up next to someone, roll to see if anyone takes body damage; if any player is in 5th or 6th and rolls max speed, ALL players in 5th or 6th gear roll to see if they take engine damage; when you pit, roll to see how quickly you come out of the pit. The game is definitely more than just a dicefest -- you need to know how to handle the turns, when to move in and out, when to use up your car, etc. -- but to me it doesn't feel like there's much more! Lots of dice rolling in a game that takes WAY too long to play. I much prefer Formula Dé Mini, which simplified the game considerably (but it's still a dicefest!)

RATING: 5
Sure there's a ton of dice rolling, but you do have to adapt to your situation.  When do you go for broke and when do you wait and play conservatively?  Probably boils down to mostly luck with experienced players, but I can see where it would still be fun to play occasionally when you don't want to think too much. Update:  Often takes too long and all the counting and roll optimizing can become tedious, so I'm dropping my rating to a 5.

A roll and move game that really works! So far, we've only added slipstreaming from the advanced rules, but it's light fun. The biggest decisions you make are what gear?

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I loved racing game especially car racing ones.  So the theme has a lot of appeal to me and I had been looking forward to trying this one for a long time.  I think it has just the perfect amount of strategy and calculating to make a person feel well in control of their own fate.  Yet enough luck and randomness so you can take risks or play it safe and have some unexpected results or things out of your control just like a real race.  The fact that there are so many maps and things is very cool too.  I would not mind owning this game and for sure would like to play it again.

RATING: 6.5
[Eurogame edition] {racing; roll-and-move; optimal 5-8p} {basic game 6.5} FD is an interesting car racing game, which is quite true to a real race. The bits and dice are attractive. It's a fun game, too! I particularly like team play mode.

Though dice are used, it's not a pure luck game. Usually, it's the wrong decision making a player lose a game. Players have to decide carefully when to take risks, which gear to use, which course to pick, which position to hold, etc. I think it's more for gamers than general players because there are many things to consider. Nevertheless, it can be treated as a family game if everyone plays it casually.

The problem with FD is that it can be quite slow if every player thinks too much.

Looking forward to the advanced game.

I like this game, but when you play the more interesting races (multiple laps) it does take quite a bit of time.

It's as if you have your hands on the wheel and shifter while a monkey is jumping up and down on the gas pedal. You control the steering and the gear, but can't control your speed. This makes the game really just a betting game.

The courses look nice, but the corners are set up so that you need to do things that aren't right for driving. Break in a straight and accelerate into a corner.

LOVE IT! I haven't had so much fun with dice since... Well, never. If I had some expansion tracks I would be really happy but with just the two I'm scared to play too much due to learning the tracks too well.I know the dice will change many things from game to game but I just want to over-play it I guess. My usual group really enjoyed it and we'll play at least 1 weekend out of the month.

I like this game. but, here's my problem with it - for the time spent, I don't feel like I get a decent return on investment. For the time spent, I'd rather play a bunch of other games. The problem is the calculations. Everyone has to count out where the gear they are in could get them and possibly the next higher/lower. Then once they are done counting, they roll and count again. The computer version of this is great, because it takes all that tediousness out and plays FAST.

Fun game, even with a large group. It's pure racing, but with some thought. The key decisions revolve around how to corner. Pushing your luck to stay in the higher gears is what it is all about. That said, luck does play a role. With lousy dice rolls, you will fall behind, or even spin out. With good dice rolls, you will zoom ahead. The game plays slower than I would have thought, but a one-lap race is plenty. My biggest complaint is the disadvantage one is placed in with a lousy pole position -- which is determined randomly at the beginning of the game.

I really like this game. Enjoyable in terms of strategy and dice management as well as the variety of tracks that are to be had. It can also be played using a variety of basic and advanced rules (as well as house rules). Have played with 4, 5, and 6 players so far. I could not rank the game ten just because of the slightly random factor of the gear dice, but this can be moderated with some house rules (like redlining).

This one isn't my favorite race or dice-rolling game, but this is a polished design and is fun in spots. The theme, in fact, works so well with the mechanics that it's tough not to get swept up in someone's inevitable (and almost inevitably disastrous) attempt to speed through a sharp turn in high gear! The game often seems to drag, however, and the game can be a bit fiddly. All in all, a little too luck-dependent, light and slow to stay in my collection, but offbeat and fun enough that I might play once in a great while.

But 10 minutes later she was plotting her moves, and in the end she gnashed her teeth when Ben rolled slightly higher than she did and won the race by two spaces.  But she agreed that it is a very good game.

I liked this so much upon first playing it that I set up a 10-player solo game to play each night after work.  It may not work my brain much, but it sure is a blast to play.

Only slightly preferable to major dental surgery. All strategy in the game is absorbed within the first five minutes of your first playing.

Formula Dé is an older racing game that I tried for the first time in November at BGG.CON. It’s an older game from 1991 that just got a reprint this year as Formula D by Asmodee, although I’m not quite sure why they dropped the “e” from the name. I was glad I finally had a chance to try this older game with a great group of people at BGG.CON and it was a fun experience that came down to the wire between two cars, even though Speed Racer finished a disappointing distant last and I was in the middle of the pack. I liked the mechanics of using tires, brakes, and fuel, which forced you to decide how risk averse or risk preferring to be when rounding corners and selecting your gear (i.e., die to roll, ranging from 4-sided to 30-sided). However, two laps on a long course made the game run a bit long for what it was. In the end, I think I’d rather be playing Um Reifenbreite, Snow Tails, or Jamaica if I’m going to be playing a racing game. The biggest problem with Formula Dé is all the counting of spaces that goes into deciding which gear to use and then re-counting of spaces after you roll the die to decide how to move your car. It ends up getting fairly tedious counting all those squares. While counting and re-counting spaces on the track is an issue in all racing games, it seems particularly exacerbated in Formula Dé. This is probably because of the possibility of moving up to 30 spaces in a turn, which is significantly more than in most other racing games where you likely won’t be counting a double digit number of spaces each turn, but rather around 4 or 5 spaces in Jamaica or Snow Tails.

Not a bad game.  My kids like it quite a bit.  Maybe too much luck involved.  Nothing is more frustrating than to be in fifth gear and land one space in front of the turn!  

Played a 10 race league...with $10 buy in and $1 per race!  Two cars each, two laps per race, 20 pts to spend building each car.  Winner in pts gets $50, 2nd place gets $20 and the top individual car (not team) gets $10.  I ended in 2nd place (out of four) so I got my money back at least!  Highlight of the season for me - finishing 1st and 2nd on week four!

Really great crossing the finish line first!! And, loads of every expansion track ever made.

Formula Dé is a fast-paced racing game in which the cars' top speeds are limited by having to end a certain number of turns in each curve of the racetrack. This can be tricky, because although players can regulate their speeds by choosing which gear to be in and each gear allows a certain range of movement, the exact amount is determined randomly. Great fun for a big group.

This game seems like it would be good.  However, it becomes a "roll the dice and move your mice" kinda game after a while.

One variant I always wanted to try is this:

The player to your left rolls the die and hides the result.  You then say a number.  The die roller answers either, "too high," "too low," or "close".  The high and low should be obvious.  Close means the number you said is either exactly that number or within 1.

First tried this at DragonCon 04.  I've had been wanting to try this game and was surprised at how well a racing board game works.  The gear shifting and turn mechanisms are great.

I tried it out on my game group, and it was well received and a good time was had by all.  One of the races had a good demonstration of how much difference a good run through a turn can make.  A couple of players managed to come out of the last turn in a higher gear and smoked the two leaders in the home stretch before the finish.

The rating reflects that fact that this is a niche game for our group.  We're not particularly big racing fans, but this game is not like any other game.  It probably won't come out all that often, but when we are in the mood for something like this, I can't think of any game that could replace it.

Terrific game.  Fun, active, accomodates nearly any size group, expandable, and makes you love Formula 1 racing even if you don't...err...love Formula 1 racing.  Main down side is the luck factor.  Tends to average out over longer races (2 or 3 laps), but in a 1 lap race, one missed roll means you can be kaput.  I find that the game is markedly improved (or at least friendlier) when instituting a "gunning the engine" house rule.  You may sacrifice one engine pt to go 1 extra space (1st or 2nd gear), 2 extra spaces (3rd or 4th gear), or 3 extra spaces (5th or 6th gear).  This seems to keep everyone in contention better, but it's not a freebee--more than once somebody has blown an engine later after using the Gunning the Engine rule earlier in the game!  Risk is, of course, one of the great parts of the game.

roll die and move to count is not usually attractive.  Shifting gears improves it. Intelligent lane-change restrictions improve it.

Rating after 1 play (Feb '07): Even though I didn't love the game play experience I had with this dice-fest, I enjoyed the group experience. In other words, the game for me was 'meh' but the crowd howled in enjoyment. Anytime a game gets a group fired up, I like that. And I like being part of that. So, Formula De is something I'd like on my shelf; I think this game would be a great game to play with non-gamers. Moreover, having any game that accomodate 10 (we played with 8) is cool too. Last thoughts: (1) the track (and hence game time) is a little too long since there is no variation or development of tactics in gameplay. (2) I think playing with the "advanced" rules, drafting for example, is better since it introduces slightly more complexity. (3) Rolling for pole position sucks. But running an individual lap to decide is too long. Oh were there a middle way! (4) I think the rule (which we didn't use) that allows you to use some n parts (I do not now recall the specifics) to move ahead 1 space is essential. The screwage factor one endures by falling 1 space short of a corner should have a strategic work-around or the luck-bitterness will definetly plague a player or two.

Just fun.  Nerve-wracking when you feel you've raced a great race, yet someone else hits some "perfect" dice rolls that have them "blow by you" in the last turn, for the win...GGrrrrrrr.  Otherwise, when this doesn't happen, joy of joys!  Some friends and I began a league.

Formula De: Rather random, but still interesting push-your-luck and choose which risks to take and when to play it safe.  And, most importantly, great fun!  

Tracks: Monaco - 9: a very interesting track, with several difficult corners, especially the 3-corner leading out to a longish straight.

Zandvoort - 5: Rather boring track, with not much room for player skill.

Neat mechanics, but killed by its unfortunate length.  Neat way to integrate roll and move into a game.  The strategy is a little counterintuitive at first, but it eventually comes out after players make a few mistakes.  Risk management is everything.  The most interesting races are the longer ones with many cars, but the game gets much slower as that happens, which is very unfortunate from a gameplay standpoint.  Although I liked it at first, when the game failed to speed up appreciably in repeat playings, I lost patience, and the game is now officially on my shit list.

Have only played once so far - a two player game in an effort to learn the rules.  The rules aren't complicated but there are enough of them that it is tough to remember them all.  I will continue learning until they become comfortable for me then I will try to have a real go at it with 5 or more players.

RATING: 6
Commented after one game. We quickly tested this game, but I think this would be better with 5-6 six players and couple of laps. The mechanics fit nicely to the race car game, the rules are quite simply once you learn all the breaking methods and how they affect your car. Could be played with casual gamers easily. Needs real testing with more participants and longer race.

Updated after two games, this game needs more cars, not players. With more players the downtime gets too high, I think. Rather have more cars for one player. Multiple laps are a good choice and give more meaning for the different areas in the car and the pitstop has some meaning.

It seems like the difference between a good and a bad die roll can be huge at times, which combined with the fact that the tactical aspects of the game aren't that subtle, makes it an experience I don't think I'd want to revisit with too much frequency. Now that I've discovered Leader 1 I see no reason to revisit this.

The push-your-luck element of the game IS the game, and it makes for a lot of fun as you take your chances and see what happens.  It's not deep, by any means, but it's a lot of fun.  I'm interested in playing with the advanced rules, and running more than one lap.

I have no interest in auto racing at all. I bought this game mostly because the local game store was going out of business and they were practically giving it away. Also, being a big gamer nerd, I had noticed the giant 30-sided die found inside the box, which of course made it even more irresistible. I played it a couple of times with my (at the time) very young children and they had a blast, but I didn't see anything that would be particularly fun for the grown-ups.

Boy, was I wrong. I broke this out with the gaming group one night when one of us was missing, the one that doesn't like dice. I figured this was as good a time as any to try out the old roll and move with some adults. Being gamers, I figured they could handle multiple cars. 

After a quick rules overview, we broke up into teams and started racing. Let me just say that this is a totally different game when there are ten cars on the track, as opposed to four. Yes, I know that should be obvious, but I simply didn't see past the roll and move simplicity when I was playing with the kids. What caught me by surprise is that strategically, the game literally jumped from Chutes and Ladders to Caylus...and so did the fun factor. Drafting, blocking, collisions...just about everything tactically interesting about racing came bursting to the forefront. By the end of the race, the whole table was yelling, cheering and  groaning with each roll of the dice. It was an awesome, awesome experience and cemented this game in my permanent collection.

The basic game just doesn't work properly. It degenerates into who hits the easy corners at full speed (or who takes the time to count out every space so they make that "perfect" choice of gears), which wrecks it both thematically and competitively.

But the tracks are just too good to waste. I worked on a DTM/FD crossover which works decently, but is too complex for a racing game, as the scale is all off between the two games. Making all those beautiful expansions to such a stupid game should be a criminal offense.

Some criticize this game for being too simplistic, or not being enough of a simulation.  I don't care, because I think that it's a lot of fun.  

I love playing it, and it just gets better with more people.  

Using different dice for different gears is brilliant. There's a lot more strategy involved than many people give it credit.  Deciding between what gears to approach a corner in, and when to stress your car vs. when to play it safe are decisions that have a big impact on what order you'll wind up at the Finish.

And who knows why, but it just plain feels GOOD to roll that Big Blue die.

One of the better "roll & move" games out there.   Lots of interesting tactical decisions: do you play it safe and downshift but risk coming up short on the corner (and/or getting passed), or do you stay in a higher gear to set yourself up for the next straight but risk wrecking your car by blowing the corner entirely?

Too bad the (original) additional tracks are so hard to get these days.

The new version, Formula D, is compatible with the old version - Woohoo!  Now they need to start pumping out new versions of the "impossible-to-get-at-a-reasonable-price" expansion tracks.


I used to have this rated a 9, but my interest in is has cooled somewhat over time.   There is a good amount of strategy, but you can still get screwed by a bad roll, and getting that in a particularly bad place early on can put you out of contention for the entire race.    It also feels like it can run longer than it should, and doing just a single lap is usually more than enough.

My first racing game.  Yes you roll a die on every turn, but it doesn't play like a pure luck game.  The range of values on each die is small enough to give you some control while still leaving in some variance.  You must make sure each player plays quickly--it is a racing game after all.  There is plenty of tension, excitement, goading, cheering, and trash-talking.  An all-around fun experience and a solid game that can be taken seriously if the players are so inclined.

The tension of a neck and neck race around the last half of the course is excellent.

You've got to love it when your son, who is barely trailing you, comes up from behind, hoping to purposely cause you to crash, and gets the lucky roll, leaving your car crumpled against the wall, while he zooms around the last turn, to finish unscathed. A beautiful game!

House rules a must.  The 'roll every time adajecnt to a car' is rediculous.  The pitstop rules are absurd.  With the stock rules it's more like roborally in frustration & annoyance. I once had someone tell me they were eliminated from the game on thier first turn with the stock ruleset - and I beleive it.  House rules are a MUST, really...

However, there is a gem in here; especially for the racing fan. Our house rules keep the basic premise but aim to keep everyone in the game, eliminate some frustration, add some complexity/strategy, and a touch of realism.

Check out my house rules in the file section "Yeastman's Custom Ruleset".

Fairly well done racing simulation, without getting bogged down with too many details. Plays pretty fast if players don't calculate too much.

Also, takes slightly too long for what it is.

RATING: 7
I can see the game being tedious if you play it too conservatively.  It's all about taking the chances to hit the curves at the highest speed you can then shift down to make it through without losing your momentum.  Having different sided die representing each shift is a neat idea, as well as a limit to how much stress your tires and break can take before wearing them out.  The collision check is fairly repetitive at times.  I think optimally once around the track is enough, any more would most likely diminish my enjoyment.  One of the better racing games I've tried thus far.

FD is really quite clever, using different polyhedrals to represent different gears, and forcing you to end a turn several times on curves to represent slowing down so you don't skid out.  You even get a limited number of "brakes" uses and "tire changes".  It's a magnificent simulation.

...and all that magnificence is undone because it's a dice game.  He who gambles and rolls luckiest wins.

Wonderful racing game, but some rules are annoying and redundant and I'm constantly trying to revise them, however in vain.

Like the basic concept and customizable factor; just takes way too long for what it is; and the dice rolling gets old.

I really enjoy this game. While it does take a long time to play, I don't ever feel like I have nothing to do as I need to prepare for the upcoming corners.  Lots of cheering, wipeouts and risk taking make this is fun and exciting game!

RATING: 6
simple but a great game for 3+  players. Plays quickly and plenty of room for skill, judgement, luck and screwing with your opponents. 

Have played it with 7 players (3 noobs) and it took ages. We cut it down to one lap half way through as the kids were distracted and we had other games to be played. But everyone enjoyed it. The kids didn't get the gambling aspect but the adults eventually cottoned on and it got a little tense. Great session.

I was suspicious before trying it for the first time. Rolling dice over and over for hours is  not my cup of tea and I though that I would have no control on the game. Fortunately, I was wrong. Sure, there's a good amount of luck, but Formula Dé is one of these games where you can make your own luck and it makes the game quite fun. Good management is also rewarded. It's a very nice game with a nice design and I love the huge tracks! However, it is a bit too long for my taste...

Simple racing game. Good for playing with the family.  Easy to learn, easy to play, plays up to 10.

Lousy as a simulation (there's probably more passing on one game turn at Monte Carlo than there ever is in an entire race there), but tremendous fun as a game.

EXCELLENT GAME!!!  Have played for hours with the fun level never demishing.  Also this game can be played by a single person without worry of setting up opponent to lose.  For a good time try 20 cars!!!

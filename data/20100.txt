The wagers part needs to grab people otherwise this is just a much less interesting version of Balderdash. Real poker chips also help. 

The endgame can be crazy random with all the big bets splashing about, but that's part of the fun.

Picked this up at Target after playing Cluzzle.  I'm hoping to play this with my family at Christmas, since it sounds really fun!  

Great party game--the more people you have, the better.  At the GCOM convention our team, Twitch and the Slimy Toads, won the tournament.  The simple rules make this ideal for non gamers, and it's a heck of a lot of fun.

Own this.  Don't think twice, just get it. This is egalitarian trivia. The geeks who win at Trivial Pursuit are put on equal footing with others. In this game you need some wit to win, and some good wagers on the answers. Sure, if you're a trivia expert, it helps, but your strategy MUST change. You can still lose to someone who has a good gut feel for who is the best guesser. Best part of the game: you can teach new players in 30 seconds. It's just that easy.

Downside: they need to publish more questions. This game is addictive and you can burn through the questions faster than with other trivia games.

This party game is a hit.

Works fine with kids--sometimes need to give them a range as a hint so they don't guess too far off if they have no idea.

To illustrate that you don't need to know any answer to win, the first game we played was won by a five year old.

LIKE: Betting big where the answers are arbitrary is fun.
DISLIKE: Tests your trivia level a little bit.

OVERALL: Good family game, young and old. The game is more about the bets, so a very obscure answer helps push the betting to higher odds.

RATING: 7.8
Party game, de apuestas con preguntas surrealistas! donde la respuesta siempre es una cifra. Los jugadores, tienen que intentar acercarse al número sin pasarse, escribiendo en su pizarrita borrable. Éstas se ordenan, de menor a mayor, y los jugadores apuestan sus 2 fichas de apuestas de su color a los resultados que prefieran, no necesariamente el suyo. El resultado que más se acerque a la cifra, sin pasarse gana. El dueño de la pizarra en ese espacio, gana una ficha, y también reciben fichas los jugadores que hubieran apostado por ese espacio. Los espacios situados en los extremos, se pagan más alto, y también puedes apostar por el espacio "menor que todas". A partir de la segunda ronda, se puden apostar también fichas ganadas anteriormete, bajo tus 2 fichas de apuestas de colores del jugador. Gana quien tras X preguntas (7 según las reglas) tenga más fichas. 
Y básicamente, reglas explicadas!
Juego ideal para todo el mundo, muy divertido, y sin tanta fustración por no conocer la respuesta exacta, como pasa en el Trivial xD

It's ok, but it's just a gambling game and if I want to gamble (which I don't), I'd rather play Poker.

It's a party game of sorts, but really, one requires only mathematical skill here - working out odds - and that's the ONLY thing you do all game.  Frankly, I'd much rather do something more fun in a party game.  I just don't get the view that this is one of the better party games.  Que?  Where's the laughter, variation or challenge in it?

Having said all of that, it works well enough, and I like Party Games, so I'll play it again if asked - but this is NOT one of the best of the genre.  It's just not entertaining or social enough for that.  It seems as if some Geekers wnat their party games to be cerebral or strategic, but that's a very hard act to pull off - it can be done - but not here.

+ Trivia games can be fun if you aren't expected to be perfect; The betting on who knows what is also fun.
- Others just didn't seem to be as excited about me with the largely numerical trivia questions.


Why it's previously-owned:
I thought that this game was inspired - a trivia game without needing to know any actual trivial facts.  However, the game got a much less warm welcome from the rest of my group. 
I traded this for YINSH.

This completes the holy trinity of party games: Wits and Wagers, Apples to Apples and Anno Domini. We use our own poker chips and adapt the rules so that everyone can bid as much as he wants for every question. The questions are too American-centered, but we can live with that.

Putting up a wrong "guess" in such a case in order to sway the numbers in your favor is good strategy. There should be a bigger reward for guessing right, to introduce a bluffing element

Pros 
- Great for people who are terrible with trivia since you don't actually have to know anything
- Most people won't know the actual answer
- Funny to see what people guess and how off they are
- Betting is strategic on who you think is right and who people are guessing on 
- Low key party game
- Fun facts are given after

Cons
- All the questions are on one side and all the answers are on the other so be careful when you read the answers to not peek at the next ones
- Sometimes there are a lot of chips on the betting mat so try to keep things organized to avoid confusion

3-7(6,7)

It's fun enough, with questions that, often, you'll think you're on the verge of knowing (but, just as often, will actually be completely off the mark). It's interesting, also, that "weaker" trivia minds can occupy themselves by manipulating the odds with just zany guesses. I think it really does the trivia genre right, but trivia just isn't as much my thing. Also, it gets a touch boring that all the answers have to be numbers ... limits the scope of the trivia.

I like Time's Up better by a country mile, but I'll play this.

I like trivia games that add some appeal beyond just knowing the right answers, and this one does a great job of that. The wagering element really helps draw players in, even for questions they aren't experts on.

Fun party game to play with friends and family. Knowledge of material is less important than choosing the right wager and this allows everybody to have a chance even if you do not know material.

RATING: 8
Wits and Wagers is a very pleasant surprise, and an excellent party game. The interesting thing about this game is that each turn consists of several steps, and each step is, at a minimum, fun.  

So, in this game, an interesting question with an unknown numerical answer is asked.  You find yourself thinking:  that's kind of a funny question.  Then you have a little bit of fun trying to think of the correct answer and secretly put it down on your card.  Then you have a bit of fun when everyone reveals their guesses/answers and you marvel (typically) at the range of guesses and have fun laughing at certain players extreme guesses.  

Then you have fun trying to decide which answers to bet on.  Then you have fun seeing what the correct answer actually was, and ideally, having bet correctly, allowing you to win more chips, giving you greater betting potential for the next round. Fun leading to fun.  Very nice game.

Fun light game. Quick setup/breakdown. We use heavier poker chips for betting, but the chips included are fine. Takes less than a minute to learn. No specific knowledge required to play (I've known the exact answer to maybe 1 or 2 of the questions and there are plenty of questions). Very good party or filler game. Only downside is you have to provide your own cleaning material, like napkins, for the answer cards. I think I can live with that! :-D

Significantly more fun than trivial pursuit.  I wish the questions were less US-centric, but at least I'm Canadian, so I have been subjected to enough American culture that the questions make sense.

As party games go, Wits And Wagers is quite fun, though we play it with house rules.  You can only wager one extra chip per button, and you get chips that other players wagered on your answer.  Keeps the games closer.

Just not what I was looking for in a "party" game.  Again, it may boil down to group dynamics, but it was not a hit.  Possibly because all the answers are just numbers, and the questions are not especially humorous, and then, it was over.  Like, really quickly.

A great party game, that can work even with fewer players. This one is very easy to teach, and people can get into it in less that 2 minutes. But masquerading behind an "easy" game, it's a ton of fun that could rarely be expected by a party game. Even if it feels a bit random at times, it also feels like you need some skill to do well.

Plus, most people just love those markers and boards. They really do!

UPDATE: I still like it a lot, but there are some other great party games I enjoy a bit more. Down to an 8.

RATING: 6
With a big group of people, it moves quickly and is surprisingly interactive. What is neat about it is that it doesn't put people on the spot who don't know trivia (something that leads a lot of people to hate games like Trivial Pursuit). Doesn't work nearly as well with smaller numbers, but a very impressive party game.

Fantastic party game, have yet to find someone who wasn't engaged by it.  Simple to understand, with a crack like 'just one more' X factor.

This is the best party game next to Fishbowl (Free version of Time's Up).  This certainly did not dissapoint in entertaining a large group of people.  There were 12 people split up into 6 teams.  It worked marvelously.  This game is great because really there is 4 minutes worth of rules to explain and you can break it down to smaller increments (only telling them of rules right the exact time they need to know about it).  Another great thing about this game is that all of the components are durable and can withstand almost any party fouls out there.  This time we had a whole full mug of beer spilled all over the game and it is perfectly fine.  Just rinse them off and just like new.  Great game that should be in everyone's collection. A solid 10 for party scenarious.

My new favorite party game.  I played this many times over the holidays with family and gaming friends, and it was a hit with both groups.  My father, who can barely sit still for any game, requested a THIRD  game of this after coming in a close second place to my mother.  The questions are varied and the best part is that you don't need to be a trivia hound to win.  I'm hoping that Dominic and North Star continue to put out games of this caliber.  With wider distribution I think this game could be a huge hit.

A very fun, quick party game.  The questions are interesting and can spark debates, and I love that you answer them yourself, but can start second-guessing when you see what others answered.  Works best with a group of at least 4; 3 or less can work, but betting rounds are not diverse enough.  One knock against the game:  big betters can either be out quickly or can end the game quickly.

Box shows some very minor shelf wear, but is solid.  Game is complete, with all components present and accounted for.  With the lack of black ink residue on the voting cards and chips, as well as the overall like-new condition of everything else, I'm led to believe the game has never been played.

Box shows minor shelf wear and lid has a slight dish.  Felt mat has about a 2"x4" coffee or cola stain on the underside on one corner of the mat.  One of the 120 poker chips (blue) is not original to the game.  Card #9 has a blemish on it.  Otherwise, everything else is like new and only played once.  The evidence was that all the cards were still in 1-100 order except for the first ten that were at the back of the stack, also in order.

I first played this over a year ago, in a prototype form, at EuroQuest II, with the designers and a bunch of other people. We all had a great time. 

I bought it this year, at EQ III, and we first played the finished version over the Thanksgiving holiday. It was a great deal of fun, and even those in our group who dislike party games and trivia games thought it was a lot of fun.

I have played in a couple of the Wits & Wagers events that Dominic & crew run at conventions. they really make the game fun, and having multiple-person teams really helps make the game even more fun. 

Dominic should come packaged in the box. ;)

Dominic is a friend, though I believe my rating is not unduly influenced by that. He's a great guy who has made a great game that everyone i have played it with enjoys.

The idea of hedging bets on whose answer is right is a good one, but all the of exchanging of money bogs the game down for what is supposed to be a light party game. It's unsatsfyingly short, but any longer and there would be major runaway leader problems (still has some as it is). And there's no reason not to bet everything in the final round if you're not in the lead, making the game have a very dissatisfying arc. Games like Terra and America does a similar thing much better.

The cream of the crop for me with party games. This is by far my favorite party game. What I like about it is that you can bet on who you think is closest to the answer. This means that you really don't have to be great at trivia to be great at this (but it helps!!!) but you really need to be good at reading the other players. Our group does a last turn change where you can only bet half of your total money and not all of it. Very high recommendation from me.

This is a good party game for a mixed group of gamers and non-gamers.  It's not as knowledge-dependent as other trivia games, but it's still an advantage to know more trivia than your opponents.  It has a bit of a runaway leader problem.  The leader has more leeway to make large or small bets based on their certainty while the followers must make big bets all the time or risk falling further behind.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like it.  Some of the questions need a little revision, like it takes SOOOOO much more money to open a subway franchise now.

One of the complaints I heard was that it suffers trivia game imbalance.  I don't see how over the course of a round of 7 questions you can really see or even have that set-in.  Over the course of 20 questions, yes...  but 7 is at the point that I think unless you're horribly lopsided, you should be ok.

In the first game I did pretty darn good while everyone was doing "throw aways" because they had no clue (or thought they had no clue) - while educated guesses and spreading chips were doing pretty well for me.

The next game, everyone was a little more confident, and I got my butt kicked until all but the last round with everyone else's guess too high, bet the house, and won.

Mark my words, this game WILL become the new trivial pursuit. It will sweep the nation and everybody will own a copy. It's that good.

Had wanted this as a party game for a long time. Heard Eagle games was in trouble. Out of stock at some retailers. House Full of Games only had a few left. Just ordered from them. Hope to bring this to next casual or family gathering I go to.

The way to sell this game to people is to really play up the betting side of things. You need to emphasize that knowing who would know the answer and betting on their answer can be just as important as knowing the answer. And then when you pull out the casino-style mat, really play up the betting again, almost like a croupier at a roulette wheel would. There's nothing like making a grand sweep of all the loser coins or emphatically counting out the precious payoffs!

The finest trivia-party game ever has arrived.  It's not how much you know, but how much you know about the other players.  This game is excellent fun, and really takes trivia games to the next level.  I have yet to find anyone who doesn't like the simplicity of this trivia game, it's a real winner.

The betting system seems to work great and is the ultimate leveling mechanism.  A trivia genius can still lose to a 5th-grader if the bets are placed in the young one's favor.  And that's how I sell this game to non-gamers, it's the trivia game where you don't have to know trivia in order to win.  Out of all the games in my collection I have had more non-gamers ask where they can get this game for themselves.

Wits & Wagers sells itself as a trivia game for people who hate trivia games, and it's exactly that.  With rare exceptions the questions are impossible to answer, so victory comes down to good statistical play and skill at evaluation, not on who can remember the greatest volume of meaningless crap.

Unfortunately, taking the trivia out of trivia doesn't actually make for a fun game.  It's quick but there's no real tension or excitement.

So, despite the totally US questions this was reasonably entertaining, however it doesn't live up to its billing of being a leveller between those who can do trivia and those who can't.

I like this game a lot, except for one thing:  the entire game seems to be all about the last turn.  In the 5 or 6 games I've played, each one has been won by the player who bet the most on the correct answer on the last turn and usually there is a player who has led the entire game only to be passed on the last turn by somebody who made a lucky guess.  The final score is therefore really only shows who performed best on the last question and not who performed best over the entire game.  That being said, I think this is a good trivia game and infinitely better than Trivial Pursuit.  Adding the mechanic of betting (or guessing) on the correct answer is a great twist.

5 plays: A clever solution to the fundamental problems of trivia games: 1) people are on wildly different playing fields, and 2) questions are only good if they fall in that narrow space between the obvious and the impossibly obscure.

Instead, the focus is on the debate about answers, in almost a cooperative vein.

This game is also a surprisingly good way to develop numeracy in children.

6 year old asks for it often. Choosing relevant questions for kids takes some parental editing.

The big problems are that: 1) not many of the questions are really very good questions; and 2) the game doesn't play well with fewer than 4 players.

I like Wits and Wagers, and it's fun with a particular group of people.  It gets old with repetition though.  You soon learn that you'll never know the answer to the question, and your bet will go on the answer that reconciles the best payout and the largest gap between it and the next "reasonable" answer.

It's Wagers.  The Wits are incidental.

This is an excellent party game. Everybody loves trivia, but many people hate not knowing the answer. Wits & Wagers comforts those people in two ways. First, making all questions multiple-choice lets people try to figure out the answer. Second, players can know that, even if they didn't know the exact answer, most other people didn't as well, since most if not all prospective answers are provided as serious responses.

There are so many good things about this game.

I like the idea of the game, the fact that I don't have to know the exact answer just the best answer.  However, it all seems to come down to the last question.  One question shouldn't be the major determinant of the outcome.

RATING: 5
This trivia game works well for different tastes. It focuses on wagering, in addition to trivia responses. Silliness of other trivia games is eliminated, appealing to those not given to girations and "team" play that usually is mostly one player with the quickest wit providing most responses. Yet, the playing field is leveled due to the wager element, so everyone can still have a good time with the "party fun" factor. Bluffing is also involved. Major gripe is the end game situation that allows for wild bidding on the last turn, which can give the final score to about anyone.

Cool game! You don't have to know the trivia (which is the case when questions are basically related to USA) and you can still win. Easy to teach and play and sure hit with non-gamers. Questions could be a bit more globally oriented but fortunately game is due to come out in Finnish and I try to figure out a way to receive the Finnish questions for my game.

EDIT: Got the Finnish edition and it makes the game very different; questions that are somehow related to your surroundings are certainly much easier to guess. The new edition is poorer in its components than the erarlier editions but new tweaks in the rules cover the loss quite a bit.

An absolutely delightful take on the trivia game genre. Limiting the game to seven questions makes a much more enjoyable play experience, and fixes the tendency of other trivia games to often drag on and on. The betting mechanic adds a new level of play and even a bit of strategic consideration to the game. As someone who is often perceived as being "good" at trivia, the option of bluffing wrong answers and trying to play the betting game is an interesting and fun angle on the game, too.

Doesn't translate well at all into British English, given all the questions are about American sports, history and measurements. Disappointing and frustrating if you're expecting a trivia game, but a good laugh to play at parties or with non-gaming families. Provided there aren't too many American sports questions in a row, it generates a lot of laughter. 

Game was, personally, greatly improved by creating our own questions. I.e. Family-themed Christmas questions.

This has to be one of my favourite party games. A quiz game where no-one is supposed to know the answers.

This game joins a very short list of games I've found to go down well in almost any group or gathering. The others are Diamant, Apples for Apples and The Great Dalmuti.

Seemed like it would be great with non-gaming friends and family who aren't interested in trying to break the game by writing "1" on every question.  If played in the right spirit, I think it can be good.  Unfortunately, people were turned off by certain questions where they would have no idea where to begin to try and guess (ex: longest shark), as opposed to questions that make a bit more sense because they are more general knowledge (ex: dates in history).  The rules as published are not enjoyable at all concerning betting amounts.  You need to play this one with the "gamer's variant" to make it a more interesting experience.  Still, you're getting an uninspired game with insipid questions and questionable components.

Very light party game.  Very easy to teach, fast to play, and induces laughter, which are the best things that you can say about party games.  It would be nice if the box had more cards, but "100 games" is good for the price.  A little anti-climatic with the all-in question at the end. Playing by the second edition rules, the all-in question doesn't affect things as badly. At lest, that the perception.

Makes for the perfect "big group" (>28 people) game show.

This is one of my favorite trivia/party games, and SO MUCH BETTER than Odds'R, which I thought was like this, but isn't.  I was skeptical, but now I am not.  I think this may be my highest-rated party-style game, as I can see playing this with people who are good at trivia, and people who aren't, and having just as much fun.  I am pretty good at trivia, but still came in close second both games... with all other players having a chance to win.  Excellent design.

RATING: 7
This is a nice twist on the trivia game. The questions are, essentially, not known to anyone. There are questions around date (i.e. What year did...) that can be known, but most are something akin to how high, in inches, is the sistine chapel ceiling (or somesuch). Then everyone guesses and all players bet on those guesses. Fun. Games go relatively quickly. We played our first game and immediately wanted to play again.This is a game that will go over well with anyone. My parents like games, but only a subset that are easy, non-confrontational party games and this fits that bill wonderfully. 
Note: I will always select party games last, but with certain groups it's the only thing that will fly. So far this has flown incredibly well with all of the party groups I introduced it to.

RATING: 6
It is truly trivia for people who don't know stuff. Out of our first fourteen questions, only three were answered correctly, and of those one was pure guesswork, one was an educated guess, and only one was truly known. For some that's a blessing, for others it's disappointing as they feel their knowledge of trivia goes unrewarded.

I like how the results are layed out and the pay out is normalized. It is surprising how often our pure guesses will normalize into the central answer being the closest one. From an aesthetic standpoint, I love this aspect. I'm sure it also makes the game run smoother, but it is an interesting phenomena all its own.

The questions are very very American. As a non-American, this is a huge downside for me. I think the game would be more fun if the questions were more international.

One result of the questions being American and their difficulty level, is that some people can not even have an idea of what an appropriate answer is, which can lead to them feeling dumb, which is kind of what I wanted to avoid in a trivia game. We play for fun, not to feel bad about ourselves.

It's a fast game. Which is nice, as I don't really want to play a trivia game that goes on forever, and if it's too short, that means it's short enough to play two games back to back.

20-minute party (trivia/betting) game, allowing for large numbers of players. Easy to teach to non-gamers. The questions are horribly USA-centric and can be quite dull which limits the game's appeal. US sit-coms, actors' salaries, US presidents and fast food questions seem to feature heavily. It's actually more fun to research your own set of questions geared to your players. Works well in a classroom or for large groups but the time allowed needs to be increased. Rated 9 for concept but 4 for questions.

Update: So many good party games have come out in the last few years (Say Anything, Dixit) that this doesn't hit the table, but I still really like the idea. I think I might prefer FAUNA over this if there was ever an English version on the game.

Mostly does a good job of balancing the trivia hounds (like me) with those who can make good educated guesses.  Every once in a while I'll play a game where I actually know all the answers, but enough of the time I'll just *think* I do and bet too much on the wrong place.

One of my favorite moments was when my son (maybe 10 at the time) was playing with several adults.  The question was when Stairway to Heaven was published.  He guessed 1950, while the adults all guessed in the mid-seventies.  Turns out that the adults were a year or two too late in each case, so "1950" was the correct answer by the "don't go over" rule.  Loved it!

It's an okay party game.  I enjoy knowing trivia, but sometimes engaging in a game based on trivia is not very enjoyable.  This game makes it a little more enticing because of the gambling element involved, as well as the fact that all of the answers are numbers.  A decidedly flavorable twist.

Amazed at how this game brings everyone to the table.  I describe this game as the trivia game that you can win without being good at trivia.  I'll use this game in large groups or family environments where I know the majority are non-gamers.  Not only does everyone enjoy - but others often join mid game due to the questions or the fun that is being had.

Gets a few minus points for me personally because I prefer a bit more strategy type games vs party style - but this is still a blast to play with almost any group.

If I have a lot of guests over and they are just interested in playing "strategy" games or "games that require thinking", I'll bring this one out. It's fun in a sort of beer and pretzels fashion. It's a good way to pass the evening, but I would rather play more "thinking" games if I could get away with it.

Initial rating of "8." Count me in as yet another person choosing this as the "ultimate party game." I don't typically like party games, but I like this game. The first game we played pitted couples against each other, and the interaction was hilarious. And, everyone asked to play it again--sure sign of a good game.

Suprisingly, after two plays, both games were a blowout. These were not close at all. And yet, you're not counting "victory points," you're playing a party game. Blowout or not, this was still fun and quick enough to squeeze in on a game night.

Update: dropped to a "7". It's a good game, but right now it's taking 2nd place to GiftTrap as my favorite party game.

Update: traded it away along with Cash n Guns for a copy of Nuns on the Run. I respect Wits n Wagers as a solid design. But, at least for my circles, the alternatives are Linq or Gift Trap. Good game, but I don't think I need to own it. Maybe I'll regret it at some point.

This game is a lot of fun, but not one to play with people who have an unusual amount of trivia knowledge. It completely ruins the whole reason of playing the game when the person/people you play with have tons of knowledge of useless trivia facts running around through their brains. This is definitely a light trivia game that is meant to be played with people who understand the concept of guessing and then betting on who has the closest question without going over. Almost like a "Price is Right" kind of game.

Awesome party game.  There are a few of us in the group that love trivia but since the others can't compete, prefer not to select those games.  This is a perfect fit for both groups.  We enjoy the challenge of the tough questions while they enjoy betting on our often conflicting answers.  Since teh questions are so far out there, we spend as much time discussing the answers as we do playing.  A truly socializing success.

In hindsight, I think the explainer of this game had us playing some homebrew variant.

In the end this is more a game of playing odds then anything else.  It seemed best to wait until all bets were out then hedge your wagers based on your closest competition.

Way out of contention?  Double down on the bids that have little to no bids.  Trying to keep pace as the leader?  Bet according to your closest rival.

If the game really can be played like this, it becomes to formulaic and will eventually be no fun at all.

A novel twist on a trivia game. I like the betting, but the limitations on the amount you can bet (from the basic rules) are painfully small. Throw that out and let people bet whatever they want to (with no more than 2 bets) and I think the game is substantially improved. My first playing was with 4 players. My impression is that its probably better with more numbers.We didn't do much campaigning for our answers. Maybe that would make it a bit more fun. I'd also like it if the bidding was secret so that players couldn't respond to what they see you do...but I suppose the sand-timer ameliorates that to some degree. Overall, the game just doesn't appeal to me much, but I'm not a fan of the genre (trivia OR party game).

Quick trivia party game.  Seven questions are read.  All questions can be answered with a number.  Each player attempts to answer those questions, getting as close to the number as possible without going over.  Answers are arranged on an odds chart.  Players bet on which answer they think is most correct.  Each player has two tokens to place bets, and may add previously earned chips to those bets.

Very excited to own this one.  Had to buy it on Ebay because it is getting very hard to find.  And, I wanted the original playmat. 

The first play was a lot of fun.  Then the group decided that the questions are way too difficult and were guessing on the wagering step as well.

To me, the game doesn't have fun unless the participants are willing to put some thought into their answers.  If you have too wild a set of answers, everyone is bidding on the same space.

Played the revised rules and think they play much better.

We've played it several times before as a family and had lots of fun.  It really is trivia for dummies.  Great for groups of any size or familiarity.  It can be a lot of fun to find out what bits of knowledge your friends and family might have!

UPDATE:  The more I play this, the more I find it well-suited for any group situation with at least 5 players.  It takes less than 2 minutes to teach and causes a lot of laughter, shouting and fun.  It's less about skill and more about having a fun experience with friends.  The perfect icebreaker.

A great concept for a trivia game. 

Has some scoring issues, as the betting order becomes supremely important as you near the end of the game. Really the only workaround is to have a secret betting system (at least for the final round) which unfortunately means you have to ditch the poker chips for paper-and-pencil.

Components: The betting mat is cool; the player cubes make for an elegant way to mark bets; the chips are functional.  The cards annoy me, because only one question is read for each card in any given game, which leaves it up to me to devise some elaborate system to keep track of which questions have been used from which cards; instead, I just use one card per game, and must just be careful to not reveal an answer prematurely.

Experience: Fun trivia, on a wide range of subjects, some of which inspire informed guesses and some of which require wild guesses.  The questions seem to be somewhat ordered from less obscure to more obscure, which I like.  Some of my fellow players find the betting restrictions too limiting.  I don't enjoy the betting very much; only on the rare occasion does a question seem to be within a particular player's area of expertise, and thus worthy of favoring that player's answer; otherwise, I typically just bet at the low end of any huge gaps in the range.  I find that the real fun is in the trivia, seeing everyone's guess, then arguing about it afterward.  The actual betting and payoff, though a very novel mechanic, distracts me from the part I actually enjoy.  I'm tempted to say I prefer Say When!, which is boiled down to just the betting, but then there is not enough time spent on each question.  I actually prefer Smarty Party, where the extra time spent on a question is mining all the possible answers to it, rather than trying to determine who among us is closest.

RATING: 7
This really is a great party game. Especially good for non-gamers as it is easy to pick up.  The betting element is popular and the fact you don't need to know much trivia is good.  There is a basic strategy of working out know is most likely to know the answers and also to be aware that betting on a number that only has a very short range to the next highest number is not a good idea.  I am English and the US centric questions are a definite drawback. I wish I had bought Gambit 7 but I am quite glad I got the baize betting cloth that comes with this game. If I continue to play this at least once a month then eventually I will but Gambit 7 just for the question cards.

A very good party game. It would be a lot better though, if the questions were less America-centric. When I play I skip the baseball, football etc question, but it reduces the value of the game somewhat. One day I'll have to sit down and write some decent questions, but then I'll have to forget the answers somehow... Still, the game is a lot of fun and A LOT of people can play it.

Excellent game for playing with non-gamers. Five games played with one non-gamer and one self-described "hater of boardgames" in one night, as they kept asking for one more game. I expect that Wits and Wagers will be a staple of family gatherings for many years.

It's a trivia game for everyone!  All answers are numbers so worst case you can just write down a number.  The best part is that you then bet on whose answer you think is actually correct so you can win by picking answers based on who you think has the most knowledge in the area of the question, etc.  Seriously fun.

I'm not big on party games, but this is ok if I have to play one. Not a trivia game, since no one is going to know the answers to the questions; really just a betting game.  Like all betting games, some strategy is required, but not enough to be interesting.

This is one of my favorite trivia games, and since I don't usually like trivia games much, I consider it one of the only trivia games I will be happy to play.  I love the fact that you don't have to know anything exactly, since all the answers are numerical.  Being able to place bets on other answers is my favorite part, along with being able to use chips previously won to take risks for bigger rewards!

If you're a fan of trivia at all, this is definitely the party game to check out. I like that this game doesn't punish you for getting answers wrong - you simply bet on what answer out of all that you think is closest to the right answer without going over (all answers are numbers in this game). This game is tons of fun, and is relatively quick so you will have no problem getting in at least a couple games in a row!

I've had a few good games of this and so far it's been a popular ice-breaker. I agree with a complaint I've seen that too many questions are US-centric and would love to see a set of questions released with a more international flavour.

Update: This has become my go-to icebreaker.  It handles large groups and can get loud and raucous.  Quick enough to not overstay it's welcome and just a lot of fun.

Caveat:  Party/trivia games are not my favorite category by a longshot.  But this one didn't outstay its welcome and I liked that you could use statistics and "best guess" to do well even if you didn't really know any answers.  I would allow bets to all be unrestricted though, to allow people to bet more for questions they are confident in and to prevent the last turn deciding the game (as it did in the game we played).

RATING: 8.5
A clever party game where the answers to all the questions are numbers, and the best guess is the one that comes closest to the number without going over.  

The clever bit comes in when everyone has made their guess; the answers form a spread and everyone may place bets on which is closest to the correct answer with payouts starting at 1 to 1 on the mean guess and increasing toward the extremes - even those not trivially-inclined can play to win.  

Played over seven rounds, the game maintains a brisk pace with virtually no downtime, as all players are involved at all times in the guessing and wagering, making for (of all things) a fast-paced, exciting trivia game!  The only thing I'd like to change is the $10 limit on bets during the first 6 rounds, as the final all-in round can make them seem almost trivial (no pun intended).   

Wits & Wagers is clearly a step above the standard trivia/party fare, and will be an easy pick when I'm looking for a game to handle a mixed crowd.

Interesting idea.  Uneasy tempo to the game where the excitement is in short bursts followed by long maintenance.  Confusion over payouts and lots of shuffling around.  Bet on largest gap with best odds.  Things work okay until the all-in bet where the whole game gets chucked out the window.  The all-in question should be completely unguessable but we had one where half the table hit it exactly.  UPDATE.  Dom just wrote me to identify and fix the problem question.  Impressive support, I'll give ya that.  DOWNGRADE.  Two more games where everyone bet on the same final answer because well, they knew it.  Anticlimactic.  UPGRADE.  Good experience with the fam.

RATING: 7
Trivia game played over seven rounds.  Each round a question is read out, and everybody records an answer.  All answers are numerical, which are handed in and sorted onto a betting mat.  Players then place bets using their two generic bets, as well as any previous winnings they want to risk.  The closest answer, without going over, to the correct answer wins and bets on this pay out.  Very fun game, but the questions are very US-centric, and there is a ton of luck involved ... the game play barely matters.  Still, the questions here are much easier than the other version of this game, Gambit 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Again, I love trivia so this is great. Even if you're bad at trivia you can place bets on other people's guesses. 

The betting can get a bit out of control by the final few rounds. A bit of all-or-nothing with the chips
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another group favorite. It doesn't get any better than a trivia gave where you don't have to know the answers to win. And it plays so fast that there's no prolonged agony if you get behind.  Our house rule is that the person who wrote down the closest answer gets one extra chip.

A trivia game for people who don't know trivia.  Everyone answers the same question, and then everyone votes on whose answer they think is closest to the real answer.

The game is fun and I like this take on trivia games in general.  However, (you knew that was coming, right?) I have serious issues with the questions themselves.  They are mostly so obscure, especially for anyone not from the US, that the chances are that no one will have even a vague idea of the answer for the vast majority of the questions in any given game.  That really takes away the element of working out who might make the best guess and you end up being left with something that is more of an interesting (and fun) exercise is spread betting and playing odds than it is a trivia game.

RATING: 8.5
So far it seems like a fun party game. Definitely more emphasis on the betting than the trivia. 

Major crossover appeal, and I love the white boards. I'd prefer less US-centric trivia questions, but it's not unexpected. And since it's the 2007 edition of the game, some of the questions are definitely out of date (Mark Spitz isn't the Olympic medal record holder anymore).

(if only the game didn't come up with so many defective pens. 3 out of the 7 provided worked... BUT the very next day I had a bunch of replacement markers sent out, which came fast and I also got the promo cards with them. Great customer service!)

Trivia works well for a party setting, and this game adds a second layer of guessing who is right. Our games usually end with no one caring who won - it was just fun for the group to mull over the questions. Not a "gamer's game", but an effective way to entertain a group at a party.

I generally don't like trivia or word games because, let's be honest, I don't know much. But this puts a fun twist on things: I don't need to [i]know[/i] the right answer, I need to [i]bet[/i] on the right answer.  This really needs a full complement to play well (bad with 4).  1-9

Wits and Wagers is the party game that's won the most awards.  While I can safely say that it's the best trivia game I've ever played it's not my favorite party game.  The game can be quite funny when you see the spread of answers the players have come up with.  The strategy is in the betting/wagering portion of the game.  Having knowledge of the trivia certainly helps but games will be won and lost based on shrewd betting.  Finally, the game is over quickly since it's just 7 questions and you just might learn something new.  I guess you can lengthen the game if you choose (with either a winning point amount or increase the number of questions) and it should be noted that a large number of players can play this simply by break up into 7 teams divided with people as equally as possible.

Although I'm not a big fan of trivia or party games, Wits & Wagers does a nice job combining the two genres. Very accessible to new players, the game play is obvious to all after just 1 turn. The gambling component is what makes this game special and brings out the competitive nature in everyone. Great game to encourage "quiet people" out of their shell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is brilliant. It elegantly designs around the 'now-it-all' problem that has plagued trivia games forever. If you don't know the answer, you can simply bid on the person you think does. Also, unlike many other trivia based games, everybody gets to answer every question, which helps keep people interested and active throughout the game. The wacky questions and the occasional huge answer gap creates a fun experience, that is sure to conjure up some laughs.

Solid Party game!  The one down side... pulled it out with a mixed group of men and women - the women bowed out quickly... perhaps the betting put them off???

Edit: Maybe that was a one time bad run!  I ran two games back to back with a mixed gender group and it went over great!  Solves the trivia game problem with a great mechanic.

A decent game; I like the betting elements, but am not fond of the fact that players can go "all in" and win significant amounts of money on a single question.  I'd like to see a limit to the amount of additional money players can place on their bets, so that single questions don't determine the game.

I own it, but I haven't played my copy. I have played the game many times, usually in a college lounge of some sort. I have seen it on a bookshelf in smaller, indie coffee shops (and played there as well). I love the game, and if broken out in a small bar (especially friendly local dives) can attract a crowd. My copy is because I have never seen a copy since I moved here to North Central Kansas. Mostly lives in my car, although I am considering breaking it down smaller to put in the overnight bag in the trunk. The large felt playmat is impressive to people watching. Easy to get players around in a demo environment.

[2 plays] Finally played this and now I see what all the fuss was about. This seems to be the Unofficially Official Gamers' Favorite Party Game, but whenever I heard it described, it sounded awful. Now I get it. And it's an OK game. However, the whole "oh, you don't have to actually know anything" claim is not quite true. Some of the cards are things there's no way anybody actually knows, but others are things everybody knows--so it is possible to humiliate yourself at this game.

A solid party game with excellent replay ability. However, each round is the same so game play can get monotonous. I suggest shortening the number of rounds if you find the game plays too long. Also, setting a betting limit per round can soften the potential major chips swings as well as runaway leader problems.

This party game will have broad appeal at your gathering once you convince potential players how little trivia they actually need to know. In this game, it's more useful a skill identifying informed opponents than being one yourself.

[b][thread=802448]The PLAYMOBIL® Legion reviews "Wits & Wagers"[/thread][/b]

(As of [b]5[/b] plays) Very accessible party game. Everyone understands trivia and everyone understands betting, so it's fairly easy for people to wrap their heads around the idea of a trivia betting game. Great fun with four plays, amazing fun with the full seven. Haven't played with teams yet. My hands-down favorite party game. 

[b]Why this is in my Top Ten:[/b] Not everyone wants to play strategy games all the time. By the same token, when there's a large group, not everyone wants to play [GAMEID=41114]. This is the answer. It's a party game I can play over and over again without feeling bored or sick or stressed out. It's a party game I genuinely [i]enjoy[/i]. Priceless.

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] My first choice whenever I'm faced with the prospect of entertaining a large number of either non-gamers or semi-gamers. Has gone over well with everybody to whom I've introduced it.

As good a party game as you will ever find.  Great for small groups and large, individuals or teams.

Love playing this game with newbies and non-gamers. A great party game. It's easy to teach and fast to play. In fact, as people are playing other party guests are learning it. This allows another quick game with different people. Also, it appeals to people that are trivia-challenged. I must add this disclaimer: I technically do not play. I usually play the MC. I read the questions and hand out the chips. Still pretty much fun for me.

First 2 games played finally and I really liked it. (think i've had this game for close to a year in the collection before getting it out).  Went really well.  I see much more use of this game at family gatherings.  I also enjoyed that the game only has 7 rounds.  A single game really only takes about 15 minutes so rematches can actually happen as part of a gaming event.  Would not recommend playing this game with groups any larger than pairs though - just not enough time to write down answer and figure out the bids.

Great party/table game for any group (parents, family, non-games, gamers).  Your group has to pay attention to the questions and answer them, so it is not a wild party game.  The questions do stimulate conversation and you get to learn cool facts at the same time.  

I do not like that all the questions are in imperial units, really who uses that anymore.  :)

A fun party game with a gambling feel.  The green felt & poker chips should lure most people to the table.  There's often moments bursting in laughter and groans from close calls.

I give this a high rating because this is one of the few games family members and non-gamers will play.  This is definitely a social game and one that wipes out seriousness.

It even offers a smear of strategy.

Wits and Wagers is the best thing that has ever happened in all of party-trivia-board-gaming-dom... ever.  No party game has ever drawn the most diverse groups of gamers to my table; and no party game has ever had people come back to my table for more than Wits and Wagers.  It takes the classic trivia game and turns it on its head, in the best way ever. Take those trivia "sharks" you know down a peg, and even the odds with a game that has you prioritize who knows the trivia instead of what the real answer is.  This changes the trivia game, and that's a very good thing. (#5)

The second best party game I've played (after Say Anything), and by far the best trivia game I've played.

And for questions that you have no idea at all, you can rely on what you know about the other players to guide your betting.  The only trivia game I know where noone is ever made to feel stupid.

For someone that is horrible at trivia games, having the option to bet on some seemingly random answer doesn't make it that much better. I usually don't have very many chips to wager either. As far as betting on random numbers goes, I would rather play Roulette (which I don't). They should copy Roulette and allow you to bet on groups of answers.

Played with 7 players so far. Really fun & interesting game that anyone can play. We have played with teens and adults and all were very interested in learning the trivia - I don't know if kids younger than 10 would enjoy that aspect much but they could still play. One of the adults we played with is mentally impaired and she came in second place and really enjoyed the game!

Better than most party games.  You don't need to know the answers, but figure out who you think does - or just take a gamble.  The combination of the betting mechanic with the trivia questions is pretty innovative.  One of the first games I will pull out for a large group.  I definitely prefer this to the other mass market party games out there.

My highest rated party game (update, second highest now that codenames is out). Party games aren't ever my first pick, but this is one of the best.  It is not mindless, nor does it require great intelligence to enjoy.  Being good at knowing who has the best answer is more important than actually having the best answer. 

You know, for someone who says he doesn't love party games, I sure do have quite a few...

Even though you don't need to know anything and can still win the game, the questions in this game are very much focused on American culture, and as a native from the Netherlands I always feel I have an unfair disadvantage when playing this game. The game itself though is a lot of fun, especially with bigger groups.

I have always just gone with the understanding that trivia games are not really board games at all (I almost clubbed myself to death with a copy of Urban Myth). And I've never been the biggest fan of party games either. Wits & Wagers transcends both Trivia and Party game categories by being a betting game that relies on trivial knowledge without making it the major focus.  Guesses centering on the median are worth lower payouts while wilder guesses are worth both, but pay out at a much higher rate.  The fact that you can bet on guesses that aren't your own make this a strong winner.  Yes, it's still light, but for a game that you can play with any party of people and have an easy laugh makes W&W a sure bet!  (There, I said it.)

This is one of my favorite party games. I enjoying guessing at the trivia questions, and well-informed players can make a reasonable guess (or occasionally do better than guess) at most questions. While there is a small reward for answering the questions most correctly, the dominant role of the bidding component ensures that all players can compete on relatively equal footing. This is a party game where anyone can win, yet the game does not feel based on luck; it is a unique accomplishment.

This is right up there with Apples to Apples for quick, fun, light party games. The trivia is difficult enough that no one will know all the answers. And the betting keeps things fun for those who hate Trivial Pursuit.
I do not like the All-In rule for the final round. It leads to many games where one player has $100,000 and another has nothing. I much prefer playing where you are limited to 20 or 30 for the final bet.

A pretty ingenious mix of betting and trivia makes for a very entertaining game.  Even you shy away from trivia games, I think this game is worth a try.

Received from my wife for my birthday 2014.

This feels to me like the ultimate party game, and I always have a ball with it. I've actually found a few of people that don't like it, but it's still hugely successful with 90% of the people I introduce it to.

The secret, I've found, is too keep games short. Once or maximum twice around - i.e. each player asks a question then it's game over. That prevents anyone from getting too far ahead and keeps people hungry for more.

If I were somehow forced to winnow my collection of party games to just five selections, Wits & Wagers would probably make the cut (along with Taboo, Time's Up, Thingamajig and Say Anything). I know party games aren't the most popular genre on a hobbyist site like BGG, but I enjoy them immensely in the right situation. And what's great about Wits & Wagers is that "the right situation" arises quite frequently. The game takes only 20 to 25 minutes. It's easy to explain, easy to understand. It's not intimidating because typically no one knows the answers to the trivia questions. And your friends don't even have to know much trivia to do well, since a good wager can earn far more than a correct answer. It can support up to eight players, or even more with teams. It's bar-friendly, stimulates conversation, and allows players to mill around, stand, or sit. Overall, a terrific package. Highly recommended for party gamers and for anyone looking to squeeze some gaming opportunities out of the non-game-nuts in their lives.

Fun party game than can be played with large groups. It's one third trivia, one third gambling, and one third Price Is Right-style "closest without going over".

Plus, you can direct people to places like Target to get it (as opposed to a FLGS, which is outside some individuals' comfort zones).

Great trivia game. I find a lot of people who aren't good at trivia have fun with this one, only drawback is putting out a number that's so far away from everyone else's can be embarrassing for them. Sometimes I just want to answer questions so this doesn't always scratch that trivia itch.

Rating after one play. Solid trivia party game, which is fun to play with a decent sized group. An interesting meta game arises from the "closest to the answer without exceeding it" stipulation.

Good trivia game, if you must play trivia.  It doesn't matter if you answer correctly.  In fact, even if you do know, reasonably close, it's fun to post a bogus answer just to mislead.  Then place your bets, move them around like musical chairs until the time runs out so no one copies your answers, etc.  The fun really comes from dynamic.  Fuddy duddies won't like this game, just like every other game.  But a light hearted group with a sense of humor should be good for this game.  I'd definitely play again, and I don't normally like party or trivia games.

Still has the issue where some may feel bad when they have no way to estimate a guess.  Historical dates that may seem obvious to some are prone to riducule when a person makes a silly guess.  (ie.  gussing 1930 for the year of Elizabeth I reign)  

Good with people that feel confident in trivia knowledge.  Topics seem pretty broad, some items you should have a pretty good feel for, others are a complete guess.

I enjoyed the design of this game far more than the playing of it. It just isn't for me. I did terrible on both the guessing the answer part and betting part. But I can certainly see why others would love this game. Lack of knowledge is not as damaging in this game as it is in most other party games.

UPDATE: Played again using the rules from the new edition. I liked it better, but unfortunately for us it created a much worse "runaway leader" problem than before. It could just be the luck of the cards, but with the newer rules, one person can much more easily runaway with the game.

My only gripe with this game is all the Americana trivia.  I think there are enough numerical trivia questions without having to include at least 1 American stats question per card.  A minor quibble, but one that makes everyone I've played with groan when the word "american" appears.

RATING: 6
Great idea for a game and well executed. Components are cheap and flimsy and a decade on, some of the questions have become a bit dated. Accommodates large numbers of players quite well, and works great in teams. Easily the best trivia game ever, and one of my favorite party games. Main drawback here is the no-limit betting, which can get exponentially out of control by the end, especially if a question comes up that a player is relatively certain of the answer to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A good party game with numerical predictions and a chance to choose the best answer given by any player.  Very quick at 20 - 30 minutes.  There are lots of questions provided, and each game uses only seven questions, so many plays are possible before ever repeating questions (unless you gum up the sequence of cards that have been used as I've been known to do . . . )
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent party game. Rating (8) based on 3 consecutive plays (by public demand!). Can only see this going up with more plays. Initial observation - needs 5 players/teams to get a decent choice of bets.

This is a good trivia game, even if you're not a fan of such games.  All the answers will be numeral, and you don't need to know all the answers as questions are answered by all players simultaneously, on a white card (using a dry erase marker).

The player answers are then laid out on the "Wagers" board (excellent quality BTW!), in incremental order, which will provide the various answers with anything from 1:1 odds all the way up to 4:1 odds.  Players may then wager on the answer they think is the best one, without having gone over.

After seven rounds, the game ends, the player with the most money wins.

The game may appear to be a tad short, but you can adjust this if you'd like.  A good "party" filler game.

I'm not a big fan of party-type games, but after one play of this game I decided I liked it enough to own it.  It is a somewhat unique trivia/betting game in that you don't necessarily need to know the trivia answers to win as long as you wisely bet on the people who probably do know the answer.

RATING: 6
1-1-10
Some light-hearted fun but similar to other trivia games, if you actually know a lot of different things you have an advantage.  Or if questions come up that are more catered to one person than another (see 'what year did NES come out' compared to 'what was Michael Jordan's 3-point seasonal average') there can be huge money swings that force unwinnable games.  Or one bad guess can sink you.

It's quick enough that you don't feel bad or sour after losing but after four or five questions if you know you're not going to win, it feels futile to play.

This is a fantastically smooth, easy to play (and play again) trivia game, which seems great for anyone.

Without prior benefit of personal plays, I introduced this to a buch of teenagers, and got an immediate encore request.

Beyond that, with 7 questions/card it has replay value, and the expansions just extend that.

Definitely a terrific party game!

Trivia with betting.  Simple idea executed well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's a pretty decent trivia game, with some qualities that aren't common in the genre: It allows people with different trivia knowledge to be somewhat competitive, and the game length is kept strictly under control by the endgame mechanism.

That said, I'm not fond of the way bids are placed using the timer: A key element in any gambling game is to know as much as possible about other player's actions before deciding your own. I'd always want to know exactly who bid on what before making my move, and the timer just rewards everyone that delays as much as possible. I think it'd work better in a gamer setting if everyone just bid secretly.

Overall, near the top of the scale in trivia games, but still not the kind of game I'd want to play most of the time, so a 6 seems fair.

Update: After more playings, it's losing luster. I think it's because the game format leads to borin, uninteresting questions way too often. Downgraded.

It's a clever game.  It's sort of out of my genre and I'm so bad at it that it's hard for me to participate much...

First played January 13th 2013. Trivial Pursuit type questions with numbers mixed with gambling. I dislike Trivail Pursuit, however this game makes it tollorable. You each make a secret bet and then bet on everyone's answers.  This gives you a shot at each question even if you really don't know.  As opposed to Trivaial Pursuit which you hafta know exactly and the game can take forever.  Nice, plays pretty quickly and is a good party ice breaker type game.

Love the concept and execution of this game. It really is flawless, but for SOME reason, this game is always downer.

When I first got this game, I poured over the bits and felt that the game was deliciously overproduced what with individual dry erase markers for every player, a rubber mat board, and poker chips...As a warning to all others, DO NOT set this game within its box cover when you play.  My lid split the first go out of the gate!  As to the game itself, it's trivia without having to know anything which is great for non-gamers or non-random-facts-scholars.  I'm not sure I'm so keen about the all in rule at the end, but I like the timed betting mechanic and the range of questions (with bonus points to the person who answers closest).  I was hot on this game for about a day and have since cooled down.  It's one of those perfect games for a just so certain, perfect time that rolls around every couple weeks or so to scratch that party/trivia itch.

I will never play another trivia game again.  The open betting round is a bit annoying, but this is still lotsa fun.

It uses the economic principle that group knowledge is right on average.  If you take everyone's answers and average them together, the real answer is usually pretty close to that.  Very similar to how a futures market is a great predictor of actual outcomes.

The new edition of the rules bumps this from an 8 to a 9.

Apr 08: This one has really held up over time.  I just can't say enough about the second edition rules either.  They are a must.

Alright, it gets a 10.  It's still a favorite after all this time.

Aug16: Resurgence with the kiddos (Ages ~4-6).  Still awesome.

RATING: 6.5
Ideal Players: 5-7

Description: Players write down answers to trivia on dry-erase cards, then bet on which answer will be correct.

Pro: More player interaction and less knowledge required. Masterfully written questions that players almost feel they should know, but no one is entirely sure. Doesn't require a big time investment.

Con: Seems like it's always over too quickly. The last bet-it-all round can make or break a player. Needs expansions, especially with more theme.

Trivia game where all the answers are numbers and you can bet on someone else's answer instead of your own and still win.

WOW! What a great party game and I hate trivia! 

Actually this is much more of a gambling game than a trivia game which explains my instant love for it and why it is so fun. Be sure to play with the timers almost like a speed game to keep the tension up. The questions are actually interesting and unanswerable for the most part which was done very wisely on purpose. This means most of the time no one will know the answer and betting on the one that 'looks' best is what really matters. 

As you only get a bonus for getting a question right or closest to it, good betting and judgement is really more important as people here say. The way the betting works is very clever, everyone has to answer and then the answers are spread out over several different payouts with answers on either end of the scale paying more (ie 4 to 1 vs. 1 to 1). The all-in bet at the end of the game seemed fine for our group and of course added tension, we kept the bets somewhat reasonable for the most part which gave you a chance to win whether you lost or won money with this bet (unless you are way behind then go for it!). I bought this to play with my non-gaming family but it is fun and quick enough to end a night of gaming with gamers so I will definitely be suggesting it. 

This is the party game I have been looking for, plays with Gamers or Family and up to 21 people in about 25 minutes with pretty much no rules, AWESOME and VERY FUN! Highly recommended and my highest rated party game. Best with 5 plus people and the more the merrier

Well, the family loves it. Oldest does incredible by watching what others are betting on. Youngest middle is still working on not worrying about getting the actual answer right, but has been the biggest proponent for getting the game on the table as often as possible. My only worry is that we won't have enough cards for the game.

Fairly fun and lively. Still, as a trivia nerd, I've had a pretty big advantage in the games I've played; since it's a party game, I try to negate that with crazy betting on the questions I don't know.

So, the playing field is more level than say Trivial Pursuit, but not quite enough.

Wits & Wagers is the trivia game for people who aren't good at trivia - it's a game of figuring out which player gives the best answers. This is great because, although I love trivia games, it's sometimes a hard sell to get non-trivia buffs to join me in a battle of mostly useless knowledge.

I do play this with modified rules, eliminating the wagering (which seems to confuse and turn people off of the game) and replacing it with a simple point-scoring system akin to the Family edition. I give each player three cubes in their color and they can place them on any answers they like, earning one point for giving the winning answer and one point per cube of their color on the winning answer.

great trivia game.. but wagers mean that gambling ability.. and in particular ability to decide who might know a particular answer, and to judge if they might be bluffing to get me to bet on their answer while they at last sec move the bets to someone else's answer.
Actually i am pretty shit at this.. I know more than my fair share as i am a mine of useless info.. but diapprove of gambling so strongly i am rubbish at it.  but its still great fun.

Among trivia-only games, it would be a high-ranker, because it can be played fairly quickly and doesn't require knowing the answers, but choosing from who you think guessed closest.

I liked this one until I got into a better realm of games, but this is a decent one in the mainstream-trivia games category without the burden of length in something like Trvial Pursuit.

RATING: 8
While many complain that the final round with its "All In" betting makes the previous six rounds superfluous, I say that you have to set yourself up to have enough cash to win on the last round.  Granted, not betting or betting incorrectly in the final round means you lose, but you have to have bet wisely up to that point to win on a correct bet.

I'm surprised at how much appeal this game has among the gamers.  It has enough trivia to appeal to the trivia buffs, but the strategic element seems to draw in the gamers, too.  One of the few games that has wide appeal amongst all the people I play games with.

I'm not really into party games any longer, especially ones with trivia involved, but this one plays quickly enough.  If you already know the correct answer(s) or another player does, it can ruin the game.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (June 2011)

I think the game is ok but my friends really like it so I’m going to keep it. I like to play with the 2dn edition rules; they actually increased the rating of the game for me. I love that it has a very short play time and the fact that you can win the game knowing nothing at all about the answers is very cool. Overall a good game, one perfect to introduce non gamers to the hobby (as it is so easy to learn).

I thought I was playing with the 2nd edition rules but last week I played the game with another rule, no one begins with any money. This change makes the game better for me but not enough to get to a 7.5 rating (at least not yet). 

I prefer to play with the Rubber mat from the first edition.

As I´m trying to get my ratings to match BGG´s recommendation system, I’m downgrading its rating. Wits & Wagers is a 6.0 to me, an ok game I would like to play from time to time. In fact it’s been more than a year since I last played it.

I've used this in a classroom with adults coming back from break.  The trivia is nice because you can win even if you don't know the answer.  At our Meetups, this has often been played twice in a row from the new gamers enjoying the game.  That's also because it's short--only 7 questions.

My dislike of 'Party Games' has to be qualified... as long as trivia isn't considered.  There's no manual dexterity or charades here... and the game is pretty damn good for 6-7 people.  As a party game, it's a winner.

Wit's & Wagers plays in about 45 minutes with a full compliment of players and I think that it's one of the only games that was played more than once in a session at our club in a very long time.

Answer a numerical trivia question with your best guess, then bet on the player's answer you think is correct.  Very little strategy, but lots of laughs make for a fairly decent filler game.

The "all in" betting on the last round (to give the players who are trailing a chance) tends to give it a 'Final Jeopardy' feel, i.e. - you end up with either a lot of money or with nothing... so the end scores are usually quite divergent.

I like much more games that need "real" knowledge about some chosen cathegory, but this is occasionally fun game with family members or friends.

This game is supposed to level the playing field for trivia games, making them more accessible for everyone. If you don't know the answers, you can bet on the person who does, right? The problem is that the questions are of the type that pretty much no one is going to no the correct answer. They might be making an educated guess, but even if you think you know about what the answer would be, you can never be sure. This is more of Price is Right game with trivia instead of retail values.

The Price is Right morphed into a family/group game. The questions were pretty obscure in the sense that most times you would do well just to get within the right order of magnitude of the answer. No one was playing seriously so the betting and paying out was kind of anarchic. People seemed to enjoy it and it's fine for a light group activity with non-gamers.

Couple of disclaimers here.  First, I am friends with the game designer (Dominic), but one bias going the other way -- I have never been a fan of trivia games.  However, if you are going to buy one trivia game, this is the one to get.  The betting element makes the game alot of fun and is a great equalizer if you are playing against someone that seems to know all the answers.  The game works well with large groups, playing as teammates, works best with 7, and there aren't too many games suited for that number.  Also the game works equally will with experienced gamers and novice gamers alike.
   Second edition -- because of the easier setup (where everyone starts with no money but a couple of "free" bets per turn) is superior to the first.  One downside, though, with a full table of seven who are doing really well, the money can run out fairly quickly (one solution is to make the blues worth 10 instead of 5, another to record some of the chips on paper which of course makes it tougher if there are still betting rounds left in the game).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A stand-out party game that shines because it allows good play independent of your knowledge of trivia. I prefer this to Say Anything because players place individual bets on an answer they think is correct or closest to being correct, instead of submitting answers to the whims of a judge. In my experience, both Say Anything and Apples to Apples can completely disintegrate into absurdity for absurdity's sake, which gets old quickly. Rating may go up to an 8 with further play.

I found in my one playing that this was a well designed trivia game but that it lacked a certain excitement in the nature of the questions and what one is trying to do with them.

Players are posed a trivia question where the answer is a number.  They write down a guess, and points will go to the player who is closest without going over.  The added kick is that first players see what the other guesses are, and can further bet on the answer that is going to win.  The designers created a very solid betting system that gives greater rewards when players bet on the more extreme answers.

The game definitely works as a game.  I also found that the questions were well chosen so that, as intended, players typically had a hunch as to what the answer would be, but wouldn't know it exactly.  I found something lacking in the trivia contest.  Often the fun in these games is the "ooooh, I'm so sure I knew the answer" or "where did you come up with that answer?"  I ultimately found that I didn't care that much about the answers, nor feel that pride in knowing the answer better than anyone else on those occasions that I hit the target.

I hope they come up with some more cards at some point.

Great party game. Every time I tell people it's a trivia game where all the answers are numerical, they groan. But once I assure that they need not know the answers, the group is positive enough to give it a try. After they've gotten through the first couple questions, they always want more.

Great party game - easy to explain, simple to play and best of all, very quick.  The trivia aspect is a lot more friendly, mainly because the whole game revolves around making educated guesses, not just knowing a bunch of facts.  The "all in" bet at the end can change things quite a bit and pretty much make the earlier part of the game sort of meaningless.  The components are nice.

Update: having played with unlimited bets in every round, it is still a little unbalanced, as a big win can ensure victory.

The non-gamers loved it so much, we played 5 games in a row. Its simple, no actual knowledge of trivia required (although you do score for knowing facts/guessing correctly), and each games plays very quickly. I would've prefered a less U.S.-centric set of questions, but there's a good enough mix of questions.

This trivia game is truly a figurehead for the genre, by allowing those without good trivia knowledge an opportunity to score well, even those who don't enjoy those games can enjoy this. Remember though that those who revel in their superior knowledge may find this equally less enjoyable. Personally I think they've had it coming for a while, no-one likes a smartass.

I kind of like the idea, but don't really like the questions.  In general I don't really enjoy questions that are not deducible from context or other clues and the lack of bonus for closest guesses means that guesses can be skewed (if answer is known) just to increase odds of correct guesses

I purchased this game hoping for a good multiplayer/family game. Unfortunately while I enjoy the concept and the mechanics the game itself fell flat on multiple occasions. Given that I live in New Zealand I feel the questions were to foreign to us and it became dificult for some players to switch between imperial and metric measurements which is a large portion of the game answers. If they came out with a more local copy I would probably buy it, but I will not play this version again. Played on 3 occasions for a total of 5 play throughs. - Math Trade

RATING: 7.5
Game requires no actual knowledge, only an ability to guess a reasonable number.  Our group also using a bluffing technique in which we tout our knowledge on the general subject (i.e. How many households watched the Dallas finale?  "I remember this, everyone talked about it at work afterwards, the number must be in the hundreds of millions") in order to sway voting.  The game is short enough that we don't get bored, but long enough to have a definite winner.  Downsides include only having enough supplies for 7 players (more could play as teams, but the way the board is set up, max teams would also be 7).  One very successful strategy is to bet the spread (i.e. answers that have a lot of possibilities between them and the next answer, eg. Answers are 1955, 1970 and 1971, voting for 1955 allows 15 years to be the correct answer while 1970 only allows for 1 year to be the correct answer, best for if you do not know for sure).   Overall, fun game that is a good warm-up game or one more then everyone is going home game.

Even though it is sort of a trivia game, those who do best at it are good with estimation rather than trivial knowledge.  Since all plays are under time-pressure, however, it still requires people to make quick decisions and usually trust their gut instead of being able to calculate out the best odds.  It also helps to know your opponents, so that you can always bet on them when a question comes up in their area of "expertise".  It is definitely the best party game that I've bought in a couple of years, and I highly recommend it.

RATING: 8.5
The game that makes trivia boardgaming fun again. Combining Vegas-style betting with trivia is a brilliant idea, and keeping it limited to a set number of rounds makes it end within half an hour - about a fifth the time need to play Trivial Pursuit to its rightful end. Has been a good fit for casual gaming. 

Not recommended for three players. Marginal with four, really gets good with 5, and 6-7 is ideal. Get fourteen people together to play 7 two-person teams, and you've got a party just from the game itself.

I hate trivia games. I’m very bad at trivia and I find it incredibly painful to slowly lose without any feeling of hope AND without learning anything that might help me do better next time. 

That being said I thought this one would be worth a try since it addresses a couple of those issues. First of all, at around 20 minutes to play it is very quick so if you’re doing terribly (that’s me, every time) the pain is ended a few minutes later. Another help is the twist that players have a chance (in theory) if they can at least guess well enough to place bets on the right answers a few times. Lastly, with all of the answers being numeric, there is a reasonable mix of answers that one might actually be able to get without any trivia knowledge by just guesstimating (average height of a giraffe, capacity of an Olympic swimming pool, Wonder Woman’s weight, etc).

Despite all of that, it still turns out it’s quite easy to find yourself half way through the game with too few points to make significant enough bets to make any sort of a comeback from your misery (which can set in remarkably quick despite the 20 minute play time). It turns out if you’re bad at trivia it’s just really tough to pick the right answers and more importantly to know which ones to bet big on (assuming you manage to earn enough chips to bet big that is).

Despite all of the innovation, I’m still not a big fan of this game. I don’t hate it but it’s just OK for me. For fans of trivia games though, it’s probably a great choice due to the quick playing time and the interesting twist about getting to bet your points on different people’s answers being correct.

Good party game for non-gamers, like most decent party games.  I was able to teach a large group in under 5 minutes, and that is exactly how a party game should be.  Play time is also nice and short, we never had to use that hourglass though, people just made decisions.  One problem near the end was the final "all-in".  I might consider having an indeterminate end to the game in the future, maybe something along the lines of "evo" where a die is rolled with increasing probability of ending the game.

A variation of Split Second.  Surprised it was the 2007 Party Game of the Year.  Scoring at the end of each round needs to be tightly controlled by the banker and it is very easy to get confused if players grab their chips and die before the banker is ready.

Nice party game. Mechanisms are interesting, but I have a cultural problem with this one: I have the American edition, and the questions are heavily focused on American facts and culture. Not to mention it uses imperial units. The game is still fun, but certain questions fall super flat for us Europeans, killing the party mood the game tries to set.

I tend to prefer English editions, but for this one it was a mistake: I should have waited for the Spanish localization.

Great party game. Too bad it is an american edition and not a dutch one. If it was a dutch one it would have been rated at least one full point higher.

How much is a gallon???

Conclusion:
Trivia never has been so much fun.

Update
I played four 3P games with Gust and Alain in quick succesion.
Although it is not great with three Gust and Alain loved it.
It is so much better than other trivia games. The questions are fantastic.

In most trivia games, you either know the answer or you don't, and the player who knows more answers will always win.  This is superior in that smart wagering is just as important... but the player who knows more answers will still win most of the time.

Wits and Wagers is a very solid party game that appeals to both my gaming and non-gaming friends.  Since the game has two distinct phases you can easily bring people into the game that just want to wager but don't want to write guesses.  

This game has a couple minor flaws, namely you are not shipped with nearly enough chips.  You are required to buy a set of poker chips to go along with this game.

Not a trivia buff? It doesn’t matter! Each player writes a guess to a question such as “In what year did the bikini swimsuit makes its first appearance?” or “How many feet wide is an NFL football field?” and places it face-up on the betting mat. Think you know the answer? Bet on your guess. Think you know who the experts are? Bet on their guess. The closest answer pays out according to the odds on the betting mat. Strike it big and you’ll be cheering like you just hit the jackpot!

Wits & Wagers is a trivia game that lets you bet on anyone’s answer. So you can win by making educated guesses, by playing the odds, or by knowing the interests of your friends. It can be taught in 2 minutes, played in 25 minutes, and accommodates up to 20 people in teams.

Solid party trivia game where one wagers on which answer you think is the closest to the answer.  Not sure if I like that potential "all-in" on the seventh round which seems to make the first 6 rounds mostly pointless since you can only wager up to 10 points in each of those rounds.  My house rules for this game is that you can bet double on the final round but no more than that.  Its interesting to see strategy actually used in this game in the final couple rounds by having a really low answer to prevent potential 5:1 payouts.

Very good, original reworking of the classic Trivia game.  Knowing the answers is not nearly as important as knowing your opponents, knowing the odds and managing your resources.

Look forward to pulling this one out with non-gamer friends.  Would play it most anytime.

The game is simple. A trivia question is given to the group that requires a numerical answer. The groups write their guesses on little whiteboards. Answers are ordered smallest to largest and given odds that increase as you move away from the median. Players place bets and receive payouts for being closest to the correct answer without going over (similar to [i]The Price is Right[/i]).

Playing with the family, this game worked really well. Playing with gamers was another story.

It was the end of the night, too early to go home but also too early to start anything too heavy. We opted for Wits & Wagers as it was new, quick, and easy to teach. the game went along fine until we had a question that everyone knew the answer to. POW! That really changed the game as we all went all it and trippled our scores. In itself, the scores were not a big deal as we just wrote bids on the backs of the wager chips. The problem for me was that we all knew the answer. This game works really well when the trivia is obscure and ridiculous, not common knowledge.

Anyway, the game is good even if that one session was a bit odd.

This is one of the best party games I've played.  As a trivia game, it blows Trivial Pursuit out of the water.  As a party game, everyone loves it.  One of the issues I've seen in party games is when people are forced to do things that they're uncomfortable with---drawing in Pictionary, acting in Charades, coming up with witty sayings in Wise and Otherwise.  Here, all of the answers are numeric, so everyone can give it their best shot.  Even better, you then bet on whose answer you think is the closest---so even if you have no idea, you can just bet on who you think would no, easing the pressure on you.  As a result, everyone can easily get into the game and have fun.  

The only downsides are rounds where no one has any idea of the answer, so the bets are placed somewhat arbitrarily.  Also, due to the betting rules, someone getting lucky in the early rounds can get a big jackpot going, which can result in an early run away leader (since they can split their bets, even if they lose one, they still gain more with the other bet).  Still, the rounds are fast enough that this isn't a major problem and you can just play again.

Every time I've brought this out, we've played at least three times in a row.  Great fun.

For the system = 9 (A great system which brings a new dimension to trivia quiz nights.  My go-to for large groups which include non-gamers and easy to customise for your situation)

For the questions = 5

Overall = 7

Positives - the game is an excellent spin on the very dry trivia games that we have come to know and hate.  The system allows you to customise questions for your group which I can't wait to do and think is essential to prolong the life of the game(however, in this case, one player will have to be solely the question master).

Negatives - the majority of questions are 'too' American-centric (I do not know if this is addressed in the expansion pack) and a lot of the questions are time sensitive.  For example, the question; how many full time employers are there at Google? is an example of bad design . . . it is out of date even before the ink had dried out at the printers.  I do not know if this was a sign of lack of foresight by the designers on the games longevity or success beyond the U.S. borders or a business decision to focus on the USA but it is frustrating as you flick through the cards trying to find a question which is not too obscure or outdated.

However, American culture has been a driving force in the last 100 years and there are many questions with an American focus with broad relevance which illustrate the positives of the system.  For example, questions such as what is the height of the Empire States Building in feet is a great question about an American subject as it is well known beyonds the US borders, offers such a range of answers and players have points of reference in their own environment.  This question is sadly in the minority.

Therefore, Wits & Wagers is a brilliant idea for a party trivia game but with questions it seems sadly designed for a party in an American small town.

RATING: 6
This game has a very clever betting system that understands probability distributions, and it's a good balance of not needing to know trivia to do well while giving you a bonus if you do. Would rate higher if I was a bigger fan of party games. My two critiques about this game are 1. I wish there was a way to somehow include trivia questions that have non numerical answers, and 2. depending on bets, either one risky bet can cause a runaway leader as no one can catch up on bets, or causes a very swingy game if multiple people have a lot of chips.

This will always be my favorite trivia-type game. The questions are great because you don't really have to know them, and it's more important to figure out who of your friends is right than to actually be right yourself. Plus, any game where you can bet your points automatically gets a thumbs up from me. I can't wait for the Geek Edition!

Recently purchased this to take the place of Apples to Apples at family functions.  It was difficult convincing some family members that it's okay to try a new game!  We finally got it on the table and played five games in a row - so I'd say it went over well.  There were a few moments of belly laughs and teary eyes.

We had five players this first outing; I do believe it would be more fun with more players.

This is a great party game.  It combines elements of risktaking and good old-fashioned guesstimating.  The disparity in people's guesses is often hilarious.  The betting part makes it interesting.  Plus, if you don't know the answer, bet on someone else's answer.  Very easy rules so it's easy to break out for a large group of non-gamers.

I've warmed up to this game. It's gone over well with my groups. It's easy to teach and quick to play, and it takes away the "performance" requirement that limits most party games' appeal to a certain set. I'll maintain my original criticism: I think it's a bit staid for a party game. And I'll also say ... the questions, while solid -- better than any in-print edition of Trivial Pursuit, for instance -- often lack the light-bulb-over-the-head quality of the best trivia (think TP Genus I). I suppose you can attribute that to the fact that the answers are always numbers (I hear my gamemate Carrie yawning now), and numbers just don't live in most people's heads. But I think that limitation makes it imperative that the questions be as clever as possible.

I won on Dom's recent geek list giveaway. I picked Wits & Wagers as my prize, as I do love some trivia game - my family played them a lot growing up - and I was intrigued by the idea of a trivia game where knowing the answer is not the be-all and end-all. Of course, many of the questions are not really something you know, more have a feeling about - calculated guessing if you will. The addition of a gambling element is fun too. But while it went over fairly well with the folks I played it with, it fell short of the high of Say Anything. My wife felt it was just about lucky guessing, which is perhaps harsh but fair. I'll be keeping it for those right moments but since the rest of my family lives a long way away, that won't be often. I think they will like it quite a bit.

One of the best party games ever.  A question is asked with a numeric answer.  Players write and answer and the answers are organized lowest to highest.  Players then bet on all answers and payouts have ratios where the median is 2:1 and payouts increase to 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1 as you get further out from the center.  

The closest answers without going over is the correct one.  You can bet on a slot that says all answers are too high. 

You can put additional money on a slow and the correct answer gets another 300 dollars.  This is really fun and simple.

Wits & Wagers is an outstanding party game with a fatal flaw. It fills a great niche (fast trivia game -- adios, Trivial Pursuit) and packs so much fun into a short time that you immediately want to play it again.

It's hilarious to see how far off people are with their answers, and the questions are generally obscure enough that at least one person is always wildly off. Nearly everyone I've introduced to W&W has enjoyed it.

It does have one glaring problem, which was fixed in Say Anything: If one player makes a few solid bets, they can leverage a couple of bets heavily and wind up with a chip stack so large that no one has a chance of catching up to them. I'd say we have this runaway leader problem in about one out of every three games we play -- and it's a testament to W&W's fun factor that even when this happens, it's still enjoyable to play.

They've fixed my problem with it in subsequent versions and we haven't touched this in a good year or two, so I sold it.

3rd best game of 2005 and my favorite trivia game.
Northstar/Crapuchettes masterpiece. They have made several other very good games, Say Anything for example, but I think this is the game they'll be remembered for. IMMENSE fun for everyone as it brings two otherwise distant groups together (people who don't like trivia games and people who will agree to play pretty much only trivia games; most of the time even people who claim not to like any games) and creates a lot more excitement than 'normal' trivigames. There are lots of other cool things I could mention such as simultaneous play (no waiting!) and questions that don't make people feel stupid in wrong way, but let's keep it short. A masterpiece. Oh, one more thing - it's VERY easy to make your own questions for this game (only one people has to read them so you can even get them straight from wikipedia or something) since it runs on such ingenious system that automatically balances questions of different difficulty levels, running out of questions won't be a problem here.

RATING: 8
Nice light trivia game in which the best trivia player rarely wins! Best with 7 or more, and better with real poker chips. Questions are very Americentric. Just about everyone I introduce this too says "Oh, just like Price is Right". It may well be; yet another TV program I've never seen! The winner always leaves saying "We've GOT to buy this game!"

I think this is a great party game that neatly combines trivia and wagering (as the name implies).  Avoids the pitfall of some trivia games (Trivial Pursuit, I'm looking at you) in that you can have fun with this even if you don't know the answer, which means there's something fun here even for people who don't like regular trivia games.

Play 8/1/10:

I think this game might be a little better with more players, but I'm not sure... We had three teams of two, and it was pretty much a snorefest. After three plays, everyone wanted to play I'm the Boss!

RATING: 9
Amazing party game overall! No maximum number of players in theory, extremely accessible, short, the questions are always interesting (although some are too US based but that's ok).

The whole betting your chips aspect is great on paper, but after a few games, the exponential growth problem that comes with it becomes obvious. It's really not that great when a player already have 20x more chips than everyone else by the fourth turn. And counting the scores everytime, while I love the concept of playing around the odds, can be just a little bit too much. Apparently the party version is a more streamlined version, I'd be curious to try.

Played 5 times.
Last Played: Mar 7, 2009

I didn't really get into it for most of the game.  I don't think my team won any money except once before the last round, then the last round we got lucky and ended up on 5pts behind the winner.  It was a nice turn around but I'm glad the game wasn't too long.

Played it a second time and had a lot of fun.  This time I did much better at the betting part and got a few lucky answers including one that I had no idea about so I put my birth year as a totally wild guess and amazingly enough it was the exact correct answer.

So the game improved in my estimation.

We just purchased it and played it at a Christmas party.  It went over very well, and it was almost a all-way tie with 0 money, except one team that didn't bet it all.

Just increased my rating from 8 to 9 as I think this is one of my favorite party games.

Game play only rates a 6 for me, but the ability to pull in light quasi-gamers with the quick rules and the 'action' in the game (writing on the laminated cards, sorting cards, placing bets, raking bets) that keeps the excitement level up brings it up to a 7, since I am willing to play more often than the light quasi-gamers are.

A trivia game that really has nothing to do with knowing the answers to the questions and everything to do with knowing what to bet on.  It's fun to see what other people guess for the answers.  Although, when you really have no idea about the answer you can look like a total idiot by putting something way low or way high--not very fun.  The chips are kind of fiddly and when I'm banker it detracts from my enjoyment of the game.

RATING: 6
The party rules work better if you are playing with only 3-4 players. The reason is that you are paid 1:1 on most of the betting options. In this version, you get paid at higher odds (anywhere from 2:1 to 6:1) and it is to easy to end up with a runaway leader at low player counts. With 6-7 players this version is superior.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As an activity it is pretty fun.  It is a great spin on trivial pursuit and betting.  But... the end game ruins things for me.  I understand you can play the game relatively quickly but the Final Jeopardy element means the other 6 questions are not very important.  

One other thing - if you play a seven player game it is very easy to run out of chips...  You may want to add some extras (you can usually find them in thrift shops) if you play with the maximum number.

Game in a Nutshell: Bid against other players on who you think got the closest answer to quantitative questions, payout, and repeat.

Played as: 5,7 player

Pro: Lots of people can be involved.

Cons: It never feels like there's any incentive to play conservatively or use much strategy. Just dump your money on your best guess and see what happens.  No joy in winning, no big deal for losing. Most trivia games are at least fun to sit and read the cards; not so much here.

Other: With the new edition rules removing the limit on how much you can bet in any round, I can see this gaining a little more interest. I may never know.

Best Use: A party where slight amusement is going to be as good as it's going to get.

Fun party game. One of the few I have gotten the whole family to enjoy. EDIT: UPDATE - I've introduced this at other family game nights recently, and this has been a huge hit. Especially nice was converting the "trivia games make me nervous" non-gamer into a fan. I love the discussions that happen as players openly try to convince each other that they are right and cooperatively try to pick the right answer. At 30 minutes, it's just the right length. I may bump this up higher if I keep enjoying it as much as I have been.

What a neat concept for a party game -- this one definitely has a very different feel to it. I wish that the maximum bid in rounds 1-6 would be 15 instead of 10.

RATING: 6
02/09/2013: Wits & Wagers is an excellent family / party game for up to seven teams of any number of players really.  One trivia question is asked each round.  All of the answers are numbers.  You are not expected to get the answer correct, though.  All answers are placed on the main board from lowest to highest creating a number line (remember those from grade school?).  Teams then place two wagers (or bets) on which answer is closest to the correct one without going over (Price is Right style).

If you bet on the correct answer you get paid back a certain number of poker chips based on the odds listed for that particular answer.  On subsequent turns you can add those additional poker chips to either or both of your bets each round hopefully to gain even more winnings.  If you are wrong though, you lose those additional poker chips.  At the end of the game, whoever has the most "money" wins.

This is a fun and family friendly (despite its gambling nature) game.  Almost any age group can play as knowing the answer isn't important.  Guessing who might know the right answer is.  It's a quick game (only seven questions per game) and it works well for large groups.  We prefer this one over other trivia games.

This is a fast and fun bidding and trivia game.  The answer to each question is a number... each player's answer is put onto a mat in sequence where the middle answer is at 2-1 odds and the other answers ramp up 3-1, 4-1, etc.  Players then place bid chips on what answer they think is most-correct without going over.  You can bid on two different answers.  The latest version is much better than the old version because they fixed the bid-limit / final round bid-everything wonkiness.

Played with 5 and 6 people, I think 5 is the least I would want to play it with as it really improves with more people.  I use a bell (from Pit) to ring when the sand runs out to end a betting round to help prevent bets from moving around late.  In our last game we had a run of boring questions about #'s of countries or #'s of states, which was kind of a downer.

This is not your typical trivia game: while players do indeed have to attempt to answer questions, they get very few points for getting the right answer on their first try.  Instead, all the players reveal their answers, and then everyone has a chance to wager points on which answer is correct.  This makes the game wonderfully interactive, and the rules are simple enough that this would be a great party game.  This was very fun, and is the only trivia game I'll currently consider playing.  

"Winning" the game is definitely biased to those who are lucky enough know the correct answers to the question, but it's fun enough to play that I don't care that I likely don't have a hope in heck of ever winning.

These old school games don't necessarily fit my definition of boardgame play in its current form, but I include this because this game is pure childhood nostalgia and created a love of dice rolling and card play and maps without the boon of electricity. 

It's a party game that lives well in the non-gamer social setting. Although I'd rather play many other games, this is one I will play rather than play nothing at all.

Very good party game! It doesn't last long, everyone keeps being involved in this trivia game with a gambling twist. The only downside I can think of, is that the base game only contains about enough questions for 30 games, which will likely be reached soon because it is so much fun! Even people who don't like trivia games like this game! Highly recommended!

A trivia game where knowing trivia is not required - nice!  I like the wagering on other people's answers.  There are a few minor problems.  The "all in" betting on the last round is both good and bad.  Good if you are far behind and bad if you worked really hard during rounds 1-6 to build a nice lead only to see it evaporate in round 7.  Also the placement of chips seems like it should be more orderly so that people can't copy what other people are doing.

W&W is a fun party trivia game.  Very simple rules, easy teach to non-gamers.  I do not like the original rules that allow an all in on the last round only.  It makes the previous rounds almost irrelevant.  We use a variation that allows bets of up to 10 (2 red chips or 1 blue chip) for the questions 1 through 3, up to 20 for questions 4 through 6, and up to 50 for the final question.

The premise of removing the "not good at trivia" aspect of trivia games is interesting, but Wits & Wagers has several issues:
- People with a lesser knowledge of historical periods or ability to estimate measures of weight, length and space will still feel silly.
- This is still a trivia game in which many answers are only true at the time of printing, hurting replayability.
- There is no incentive to place a bet before the very last second of the timer, aside from influencing other votes (which is pointless once figured out).

Well, Smarty Party was the old favorite trivia game--but W&W blew it out of the water.  Fresh, fast-paced trivia fun. Someone who doesn't know the answers can win, but the bonus 10 chip for being the closest helps you out in a significant way.  So far the questions are good: You have an idea of what the answer might be , but it's hard to know exactly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Wits and Wagers is a clever party game that seems like it should be more fun than it is.  Theoretically its a great idea; you don't actually have to be good at trivia to be good at this game.  The problem is that after the numbers are revealed and you are betting on the numbers, you don't really have any more information than you did when you made your own guess.  So even if you are your friends have a laugh at some of the "crazy" guesses, half the time those guesses may turn out correct.  It can be very difficult to come back from a bad position in the game, and though party games aren't supposed to be about winning and losing, this is still a game.

Wits and Wagers is one of the better party games that I own, but that's not really saying much.  I want to like it more than I actually do, and every time I play the end seems sort of random and unfulfilling.  Perhaps it will grow on me, and I'm not planning to get rid of it, but I am not as enthusiastic about it as everyone else seems to be.

Better to get than WW Party and Family because PARTY HAS MOST POP CULTURAL references while this one is most timeless, alongside family. So this has better questions. Component wise its superior to Family since Family has 5 markers and eraseboards vs the 7 in this. Then Family is geared a bit more for kids too. This original also has a felt mat and 80 vhips of 20 blue 60 red which is way more than Familys 10 meeples. This one also has 700 questions and can be used with Familys superior scoring, and i like that you can use more variants as well with more replay with the 700 questions vs only 250 or so.

One of my favorite party games, and by far the best in the trivia category. I have introduced this to new gamers and they all agree that it is a great equalizer.

Good party game, and one of my favorite trivia games.  As others have said, it really isn't about knowing all of the answers to trivia questions.  This game has fun, unlikely-to-get-right questions, and you have to guess which answer is the closest.  It's a good design and makes for a fun, casual game with a group.

RATING: 10
Such a wonderful game.  Anyone can play it and have fun.  It's not about knowing answers, it's about having a good guess, reading others who might know more about a thing than you and using that.  You don't have to write the best guess, you just have to bet on it!  Even played with more than 7 once.  You just have to have something for someone to write answers on and bet with.  Such a fun group game or even a 4 player family game.  It works in all situations but I wouldn't want to do less than 4.

We've had a lot of fun with this party game, but it seems a bit on the serious side.  (Maybe it's just the people we've played with.)  I like the aspect that the game is not about specific knowledge, and I like how people can come from behind to win on the last round based on a good wager.

Wits & Wagers is great in a lot of ways.  It is one of a few games that can be played well by large groups.  It is super simple, and very quick, which makes it great for filling time when you have multiple groups playing at once.

RATING: 5
Most trivia games suffer from the fact that players with encyclopedic knowledge will do better than players without such knowledge. Wits & Wagers solves that problem by having everyone present their answers for all to bet on before the correct answer is declared. All bets made on the answer closest to the accurate result payout. In effect, players don't need to know the answer, they just need to bet on who is most likely correct to win.

That being said, many people might be turned off by the fact that all the trivia questions in Wits & Wagers are numerical.

Despite being described as a Party Game, W&W is slow and low energy. A party game that would suck the life out of a party? Fail.

How many feet tall is the Empire State Building?  Everyone writes down a guess on a dry erase card, organize them from highest to lowest which denotes the pay-outs (2:1, 3:1), than everyone bets their chips on which guess they think is correct.  Pay out the winners, and repeat the process 6 more times.  

This is a really fun, quick, gambling game that everyone seems to enjoy.  Bet wisely, and you could end up with the most chips and win the game.

Very enjoyable party game, but plays almost too quickly for the betting mechanic to have much weight.  One of it's greatest strengths is it's scalability.  I've played this with as few as 5 people and as many as 21 people, and both groups had a great time.

Un party game semplice e immediato incentrato sulle scommese. Potrebbe stancare vista la ripetitività delle azioni ma personalmente il gioco mi ha divertito.

Needs a rule adjustment. The winner of the last question wins the game. As is, it comes down to ONE question. Would be better if all bids were all-in or none were. Family loves it though...

played it a few time with 3 plp... it was okay... but i crushed my friends with ridiculous bets on obvious answers...


this could be fun in a bigger crowd... but like most betting games i think since its not "real" money... you could get plp winning off of stupid bets. I like the game... but the people you play with need to know how to adjust thier bets based off of other peoples bets... otherwise it will get really unbalenced


will play again.... only with more than 3 hopfully more than 5 plp

Best trivia game ever because it solves the major problem of trivia games: the yoda always wins.  In W&W, however, the points are awarded not merely to the one with the best knowledge of the topical subject matter, but to those who are best at betting on the most feasible answer.  However, like all trivia games, it's only good at the right place, right time, and in this case, with lots of players.

[i]We've previously played the Family edition which I still prefer. I like the straight forward scoring in the Family edition, I didn't find the betting mechanic added anything to the game and the questions were much harder for the kids at the table to answer, especially since a lot of them were dated.

OK.  Kind of weird and kind of fun.  A lot of the questions are kind of dry.  We ended up just looking for the funnest one on each card rather than asking in the prescribed order.  My wife really disliked the randomness of the bid scoring.  I like party games and this was OK.

Played it again with funnier people and discovered it got better.  I need to try it a couple more times.

After a good dozen plays, this is now my favorite party game by far.  And I've even converted a few Apples to Apples players, so we now have a choice of which party game to play when we need one.

RATING: 8
Love it. Besides "Say Anything", Wits is my favorite "Party" game.

Even if you suck at the trivia part (I kinda do)-you can make up for it in the wagering. Great from anywhere from 2 to 7 players and probably would do the 21 (from the box) just fine in teams.

I finally found the cool mouse pad 1st edition. With non-gamers. I play the rule where limit 10 per bet, if you run out the cubes count as 5 point bets and final round you can bet whatever you have. 

With gamers- no limit on bets.

*Also has questions from Wits & Wagers Family in box

Solid party game.  Great when you don't want to play Apples to Apples or Balderdash.  It is a little rough around the edges.  Some cards had bad information and the timers did not work at all.  Still worth trying if you'd like to add a new game to the rotation.

RATING: 6
A decent game, but for me, trivia games aren't as fun when no one at the table has the slightest clue what to guess.  The price-is-right mechanic makes it a little frustrating too, when you have a good guess and a close guess makes it worthless.  I'm not a huge fan of the everything-in last round, because while it makes it so that no one is out of the running in the last round, it also means that the first six rounds aren't particularly relevant.

It was a fun party game.  There's trivia, however you don't have to know it--just be numerically close and have the correct bet.  It's definitely a good pickup.  

I didn't care for the "all-in" at the end, where one person can come back to win on the final question.  It's also too short, however it could be modded by playing more questions.

Probably a good party game for Americans. I think it's frustrating trying to guess some pointless numbers and at the end see who guessed closest or nobody. Were the questions something more sensible, this would make a good game. Like this, it's not even a good party game.
Well, ok, I give this one 4 because it has some tolerable chip-activity.

An effective "game for non-gamers" option. 

I brought this to Christmas at my sister's. My brother-in-law and sister initially declined to play, so we started playing without them. However, as soon as we read the first question aloud, they both perked up and started pondering the answer aloud. So we handed them each a whiteboard and a marker, said, "here, write your answer on this," and then they were playing and having fun!

Fun trivia game where rather than having to know the answer, you just have to place a bet on which player's answer you think is correct.  Questions like, "How many kernels of corn on a corn cob?" and "What year was the elevator invented."  Only 8 questions per game, so it goes quickly, and is good for smaller parties, esp. 5-8 players.

This is a Trivia game meet with Las Vegas and had a child together. The questions are very nicely collected to challenge adults and children alike. Laughter were brought about when some people in the group had no clue how to answer the question and put down silly answers on their answer board. 
The game can be tense when the timer is enforced, and is very much so for those indecisive players. It offers great fun game for a party setting. Recommended for at least 5+ players to be fun.

Great party game. I prefer it to Apples to Apples, as there is ACTUALLY A CORRECT ANSWER. Yes, I'm sure Paris is 'delicious', but I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING IF I JUST RANDOMLY SELECTED A CARD AT THIS RATE.

Friends don't let friends play Apples to Apples. Convert them to W&W, and all will be ok.

I really should get this game for when I attend larger parties with my friends.  We all like games but whenever we get together I always have way more than 5 people who want to play - which cuts out pretty much 80% of my game library.

I have since played several games of W&W and they've all been good.  Like others, my gaming groups and I aren't that fond of the frequency of USA-centric questions.  This game would definitely benefit from theme decks, a-la Trivial Pursuit. 

Regardless, this is a minor quip.  The game is fantastic and is packaged very well.  The felt 'board' is a very nice touch and really helps to drive the gambling theme along.  

Without a doubt, one of the best party games I've ever played.

Much much better than other quiz games since it's actually a game unlike Trivial Pursuit which is just a quiz.  Have played good games with between 4 and 20 players.  Questions that come with the game suffer from being a bit American but was improved when I made some bespoke questions for a gathering of friends.  Good since the person who knows the answers to everything normally doesn't always win.

Oh, man, this one is fun! A great re-working of trivia games into something more accessible for everyone, yet it still seems more sophisticated. The crazily esoteric questions combined with the element of betting on anyone's answer each round truly makes this a terrific game. Lots and lots of laughs with the right group. Highly recommended party game.

Fun trivia with some cool mechanics. Kinda want to try applying this to non-numbers trivia.

It has a pretty high rating because trivia is fun, and it brings something new to trivia that levels the playing field - normally, trivia is all about knowledge. Wits & Wagers is more about making good guesses, and then, when presented with everyone's guesses, re-evaluating.

That mechanic is really clever. Simple, elegant, and fun.

Picked up at Target on 11/01/2007 for 30 bucks. I had a $25 gift card from a bonus at work, so this was as good of a choice as any. Since the second edition was coming out, I wanted to get a copy of the first edition before it went oop. The game is a really fun party game. I don't generally care for party games (especially trivia games), but this is actually more of a betting and bluffing game. The quick play time is good for short attention spans. I like that you don't actually have to have any general knowledge to do well. You just need to make smart wagers.

Just got and have only read the rules, but I'm almost certain that this game will be at least a 9.  I like It Takes Two (look it up) and Say When's ok, and this seems to combines that sort of thing with the fad of Texas Hold 'Em (which I could do without, probably). Update: played twice and it was just OK.  As with many games, the questions were hit-and-miss, some too easy, some (the better ones) ridiculous shots in the dark.  So I'm still looking for that perfect party trivia game that doesn't reward the trivia nuts too and puts even the anti-trivia crowd at no disadvantage.  New update: played more, and liking it more and more.  The "Quick Start" variant (where you use the cubes to bet) seems well-liked by most.

Coming from the UK, I use instead the questions from Gambit 7. I also decided to replace the plastic chips with proper clay poker chips. Love the sound they make when you lay them down.

Played it only once in a pub and we got the rules wrong so I cannot pass judgment on it yet. I am sure it is more exciting when played with teams. So far, I found it a bit underwhelming and dull. 

Edit: Played it again and it is far from being the super-outrageous partygame, that is, if you do not play in teams. I can see how this would be amazing in teams, but it will be hard to find 12 to 14 people. Still a great game, but I wish I had known that the experience is only half-baked when playing without teams.

Fun party game that moves along with fast pace and seems to be over too quickly. Very accessible game that will suit all ages and gamers and non-gamers. The questions do have a US bias which will be an issue for some non-US players.

Genius trivia game. Most trivia games require a specific knowledge level of a specified field. This becomes a problem for different age groups because we grow up knowing about certain things and nothing about other areas of our history. Wits and Wagers solves this problem by not requiring the exact right answer but rather your closest guess and takes it further by being able to bet on who you think has the right guess. You can play this with all ages and knowledge levels and it is fun for all.

On a side note, we own another game called Guesstimation which is essentially the same game without the betting aspect. If you ever have the chance to pick this game up for cheap you will double the amount of questions available to you.

RATING: 6.5
The upside:
-I really like this trivia game. It values how much you know about stuff, and how much you know the people you're playing with. Probably the best trivia game that I know.
-It keeps you engaged the all time.
-The slight hint of casino game is something that I appreciate is small doses.

The downside:

VERY nice party game, that avoids the pitfalls of most party games -  it asks obscure trivia that not many people know, but doesn't require knowledge of it to win (or have fun). Many times your answer will be way off, but based on the other answers and the odds of them, you can place your bet on the smart risk and end up on top.
I would be confident to pull this out at almost any party gathering of non-gamers and be pretty sure it'd be a hit (something I can't say about many games, party of otherwise).
I would suggest playing with at least 6 if you can.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
I generally dislike trivia games (rating 1, 2, maybe 3). This one is a little better solely because of the addition of betting on the answers, although it seems it all comes down to the final question: if you don't bet it all, someone who did will beat you, and if everyone bets it all, whoever gets it right will win and nothing that happened before will matter except as a tie-breaker. I didn't mind trying it once but I'm unlikely to try it again.

[b]RO[/b]: [i]1/30/2016[/i]

Originally we found this at a Goodwill and realized after we got it home that it was missing some components (namely the actual betting board and a sand timer). We mocked up replacements and played it a couple times, enough to know we should buy a copy that actually had all of it's parts; so we did.

Wits & Wagers is an outstanding party game. I've never had someone walk away from it thinking it was a bad game. No, it doesn't get requested like Cards Against Humanity, but when you feel like a bit of gambling and speculating, this can't be beat. The questions are phrased in such a way that you have to give a ballpark figure on a numerical fact (for instance how many stitches are in a standard baseball, or something equally obscure) it's possible you actually [i]know[/i] the answer, but that isn't the point. The point is you have to bet on who you [i]think[/i] knows the answer, or who you you think will get the closest. It's a really interesting mechanic and makes for a very fun time.

RATING: 8
A fun party game that combines useless trivia with reckless gambling. The answer to every question is a number and once everyone submits an answer, they are arranged and players place their chips on which they believe to be the closest without going over. Since you can bet on other players' answers, no one feels left out if they are not familiar with the subject and couldn't even guess. Many questions can be dated and reference old information. When this happens, I read the question as "According to the Guiness Book of World Records in 2010, how many...". Cards do turn up time and time again which can lead to familiarity but if you don't play often, you should be fine. This may be my favorite party game and is in my top tier for sure.

A great party game that mixes obscure trivia and guessing with estimation and betting.  A lot of fun with a large group (may need to modify the pay-offs slightly).  However, there don't seem to be enough rounds to create a continuous game.  It's more like a series of isolated questions without a larger context.  This is fine, but it decreases the significance of the wagers.

If you need a party game this is it. Never had a bad time with this game. Plays better the more people that there are. We did a 14 player match with teams of 2 and it was fantastic! The more people that play the higher my score for this one.

Only downside is you really need at least 5 before this gets remotely interesting. But again, the more people that play, the better this gets.

Interesting twist on trivia games - I like the answering and wagering mechanic.  The "field is too high" choice is interesting too, but alas, in the games I've played, someone has always started low balling all the answers, so the 5 to 1 space never came into play.  Fun game.

All players write down their guesses to trivia questions (whose answer is always a number), but money is mostly earned by betting on who is closest to the right answer, rather than actually getting the answer right. You can get all the answers wrong and still win the game.

One of the more enjoyable trivia games played at conventions.  The game design is pure simplicity, and it's very easy to develop your own questions.

--May2006-- Fun stuff; it's the lone representative in the "trivia game I like" category.  Why does it work?  There's a lot of emphasis on interactive play;  the bidding mechanism is quite delightfully engaging (perhaps not initially, but certainly as players start to pay attention to who is placing bids where); and the value of knowing the answers is also appropriately minor.  Looks like a hit:  the only question is its staying power.

Meh. Family likes it, everybody likes it, but I'm beige to it. This is the first game I've listed here which is slated for removal. Sure, everybody gets to do the gambling and guessing thing, which is nice, and easy. But no one ever exposes themselves (in a good way) here, or takes any chances, or is creative, really. It feels kinda removed or something. Play is too hardwired for me, not enough opportunities for personal expression. 

I know I have other games here that could be accused of that (Diamant, perhaps Codenames), so why don't they bother me? I don't know. Maybe all of the above are just reasons I've made up to cover the fact that I hate trivia games. And trivia in general. Trivia feels like petty knowledge to me. Knowledge without context or meaning. 'Gotcha!' knowledge. Creating opportunities to be wrong. annoying, foolish. 

Yeah, maybe I just don't like trivia, I think I've written myself to the heart of it. In any case, thinking of Funemployed to preplace this. Seems like it would play like Snake oil, which is a high compliment!

Bought in good condition from GW. Fun family game for large groups.  I'm not a huge trivia fan but this flips the script by having all answers only in numbers and allows you to bet on anyone's answers.  So knowing the answers is much less important than betting on the actual correct ones.  I also like the fact that you learn some crazy and fun facts along the way.  We will be playing this at many future family gatherings.

This eliminates one thing I don't like about trivia games - you don't have to know the answer! Instead, answers are generally numeric and sorted onto a betting board. After seeing all the answers, you choose to place bets, with there being better odds for answers that are farther from the median. I imagine this plays best with a full table.

I couldn't fathom, after reading the rules, how this could be fun, especially among people who don't care for trivia, but I'm a believer after hosting a very raucous 7-player game. Still, how much fun people get out of it can really depend on the questions (I highly recommend getting a non-participant to pick interesting/relevant questions instead of drawing blind), and I noticed trivia fans enjoyed this a lot more than others. Will only pull this out for trivia fans, and I'm confident Say Anything will go down much better with everybody else.

This game was something of a pleasant surprise for me.  In general, I don't particularly care of trivia games at this stage in my life.  For one, my work revolves around recalling too much minutiae for it to be something pleasant for me to do in my time off.  Beyond that, it is just really hard to come up with a trivia game that is easily balanced among the people playing.  It is on the latter that this game truly excels.  In my experience, rarely is the person who is the most expert in trivia the one who wins this game.  That is fine by me.  Even the totally clueless can do well if they guess right (or manage to blindly follow the appropriate people).  All in all, I find this game to be fun to play as opposed to the mental masturbation that most trivia games are at heart.  [02/17/2008]

Wits & Wagers -- Played 3 through 7 players.  Streamlined, elegant rules, clearly written.  High production quality.  Balanced game mechanics.  Cool and thoughtful components.  The combination of betting and trivia questions whose answers are numbers is a perfect fit.  Many game companies would simply have included a cardboard board, and paper pads and pencils.  By using a roll-out mat, personal whiteboards and white-erase markers, Northstar Games proves they care about the entire gaming experience.

Played once with 4P. I really like the betting system behind this as you can bet on any answer you think is the most reasonable. However, too many of the questions are US-centric, and it is difficult to muster the interest of my group in unrelated facts. Despite my fascination for trivia, even I found some questions dull – I'm pretty sure I'll never impress anyone by knowing when the first Hispanic Barbie doll was manufactured. 

Still, there are moments when the game livens up with certain questions that pique everyone's interest, but unfortunately it doesn't happen often enough.

Only played with an extremely large group (>50). Entertaining and easy to play. Its fun to find out what the answers to each question are. However, while it is true that you do not need to know any trivia to play and even win this game, you may feel like you're randomly guessing for each question, so a win may hold little satisfaction. However, betting heavy and getting rewarded is always a thrill.

[15 plays] This plays very quickly, and it is likely people will ask to play again immediately. Strong points for this game are: The answers always being a number, 30 sec time limits, there is no great pressure to be perfectly correct, the ability to bet on the correct answer - in part based upon the knowledge base of your competitors, the fun variety of questions, and the nice components. All in all, an excellent party/trivia game and the best of its genre.

This game always results in interesting discussions and tangents. Lots of fun with people you enjoy. It has been quite enjoyable in several games where the players have spanned 3 generations and have that spectrum of knowledge and experiences.

Absolutely the best trivia party game, in my opinion. Nothing else even comes close. You aren't punished for not knowing something in this game- everyone just tries to get as close to the correct answer as they can. Then you bet on which answer you think is closest. You do get a small bonus if that person is you. But you can win this game without knowing a single thing. I love the simultaneous reveal of answers and comparing what everyone else thinks. Playing with a group you know is definitely better than a group of strangers, as you can tailor your bets based on your knowledge of your friends/family. For instance, I love geography, so when questions of that nature come up, my answer will often draw more bets because my friends think I may just know it. You need at least 3 players for this, though it doesn't truly shine unless you have at least 5, if you ask me. You can also play in teams with LOTS of people. I know this is done at cons, though I haven't participated in that sort of setting myself.

I'd like to think that this game wagering game dressed with a dumbed down trivia game for the masses. But as with wagering, it can be a whole lot of fun.

Players are read a trivia question (all answers are based on numbers) and write down what they think is the correct answer. Once answers are revealed, they are ordered from low to high and players then bet money on one or two answers. The payout ranges from 1 to 1 to 5 to 1. The person who got the answer correct gets 10 points.

The game moves along very smoothly and there's never a dull moment and the mat is very nice.

My only gripes: The chips included are el cheapo. Functional but very ugly. Also, I don't like the fact that the game forces players to bet a maximum of 10 points per question THEN allows everyone to go 'all in' for the final question. Sure, it's a catch up mechanism for those who haven't been lucky but it can be a little overbalancing.

Good fun nonethless.

What a clever take on trivia games. Often having no clue what's a reasonable answer makes the game more fun, or at least funnier. 

It's a great way to find out what areas of knowledge you're completely ignorant of. The fastest mile ever run was 8 minutes? Sunlight takes 10,000 seconds to reach the earth? 

Maybe the best thing is it doesn't overstay its welcome. There's nothing like a three hour game of trivial pursuit to ruin a night. A 7 round game of wits is 30 minutes tops.

Played a couple of games.  Some of the questions are too American.  As long as you keep this as a light party game where you don't resort to tactical guesses, quite a nice game.

As I was given this as a gift, I didn't get to pick the new version of this game.  I don't mind the payouts being less, but I wanted the clarified questions and better game components.  As a result, betting with the cheaper chips was kind of a turn off during the first play.

It seems that how much fun this game can be is directly related to how much fun you were having beforehand.  We were kind of tired and a little detached from playing a less involved game immediately before, and this game was decent but didn't add excitement.  I imagine with the right mood and a larger crowd, the highlights of Wits & Wagers would be accentuated.

Grr!!  This game annoys me.  It has some potential, but it's ridiculous that the bonus for the answer closest to being correct can only be received if you do not go over the true answer (ala The Price Is Right).

Played this at BGG.con'05. It was a fun diversion, and raised some laughs and other loud exclamations. A good choice for after Thanksgiving turkey with the family, I think.

What makes this better than other "trivia" games is that not only do you not have to get the exact answer (the closest answer that doesn't exceed, wins) but in the betting phase you can place your bets on someone else's answer. I really like this as a party game.

Increased my rating from 7.5 to 8.5 after repeated plays. All my non-gamer, casual-gamer friends love this game.

I love trivia games that don't require for me other other players to know much trivia. "Wits and Wagers" seems like the perfect game for that and for the most part it is, however the problem I have with the game is that I want the trivia game to teach me something new and interesting, but many of the questions in this game are quite meaningless (like "what percentage of M&Ms are brown" - who cares?). Also to a European player, all the US-centric questions, especially with lengths and distances in miles and feet, will quickly become quite annoying. If however you skip the boring questions and only ask the interesting ones, the game is quite good. Or if you have a large collection of additional trivia games with questions with numerical answers, you can combine those questions with this game and get a very nice synergy. By itself I rate the game a 6, but if you skip the mindless questions and have access to additional questions from other sources, I would rate it a 7.5.

The only trivia game in my collection besides Cranium (if you even really consider cranium a trivia game). I don't own a lot of 'party' games but this along with Apples to Apples and Cranium are basically instant fun with a group of friends that would probably not want to play 75% of the other games in my collection. This game went over especially well with my family when I gave it to my parents for Christmas. My favorite thing about it is that it's a trivia game that doesn't put anyone on the spot. I find most trivia games tend make a lot of people uncomfortable because they're worried about not knowing the answer. In this game you don't need to know the answer, you just need to bet on who you think MIGHT know the answer or what you think looks close enough after everyone has debated their points of view. It's quick, it's fast, there's no down time and I love how everyone discusses what they think is the right answer, places their bets based and what everyone has guessed and then waits anxiously to see the results when the answer is read out. Almost every answer creates a big response from the group. This is after playing several 7 player games over the holidays with the original edition. I've just bought myself the new edition but have yet to play it.

Know a few gamblers?  Know some competitive types that you'd like to laugh at while gaming?  Then this game would be good for you.  Although not cut throat, and not a serious trivia game, it's balanced enough to let those who stink at trivia beat the pants off of you.  It's great for a party!

RATING: 7
It's not a trivia game, it's really a betting/bluffing game, and you're betting on who you think knows the trivia. Reasonably interesting, reasonably fun, but most games come down to who guesses right and goes all-in on the best answer in the final round. I'd like it more if the questions weren't so obliviously and unapologetically Americocentric.

RATING: 8.5
Easily my favorite party game. I love gambling, and at its heart, that is what this game is all about. I love that the trivia element can help you, but only a little bit, and often it's much more about playing the odds and the other people than it is what you know. A great game to involve a bunch of people.

The "wits" part is halfway interesting, much more so than Trivial Pursuit, but the "wagers" are what make the game what it is; it's a bit like Dixit in that you have to think about what your opponents may or may not know.

This is a fun party game.  It's found my way in and out and back in again in my collection from various trades.  One of the things that makes this game fantastic for casual environments is the ease of dropping in and dropping out, combined with how fast the rules are to explain.

One of my only quips about this game is that the questions involved are very American-centric.  There are new versions of this game coming out that seem to dive off to areas I'd find a little more fun though,  like the Geek one.

I like the theme and mechanisms of this game very much, but for me it suffers due to the simple fact that the questions are based on American pop culture, not British. Lots of the cards just aren't relevant to me.

RATING: 9
Good party game.  Gets many types of players involved becuase you can either:

 - know the answer, or 
 - know who knows the answer, or 
 - play the odds and ranges between numbers and know nothing about the answer.

I personally like it becuase I enjoy trivia games (although I'm not good at them), but I also like going to casinos and figuring odds, so I just tend to bet on the best speads to odds and do well.

Only negative I've gotten from someone is that they didn't like it becuase it was so focused on numbers.

Nice "party" game that rewards not knowledge of trivia but your ability to estimate or make educated guesses.  And if you miss it the first time you get a second chance to feel smart (or dumb) when you get to bet on the answers.  This has gone over well with gamers and non-gamers.

One of my favorite party games.  Whenever I see it on the game shelf as a possible choice, it always sounds good.  I love how trivial knowledge is not a requirement to winning here.  The game board itself is one of my favorites and the betting is oh so fun!  Plays quickly and is easy to learn too.  A great idea for a game.

RATING: 7
This is a fun little party game that plays similar to Say Anything (same designer) but with numbers.  A question is read with a specific numerical answer, everyone writes down their guess, and afterwards betting is made with poker chips on which answer is correct.  Whoever is closest without going over gets a payout.

We like to play with more than the suggested 7 rounds because it feels like the game is over too quick with just 7.  A lot of times the winner of this game is determined early though.  One big payout and a player can usually be stingy for the rest of the game and win.  This is especially true when a player knows the right answer.

The game is best when nobody knows the right answer but can make a reasonable guess and most of the questions do a good job of coming up with questions that fit this bill.  But when someone knows the answer for some specific reason and can bet the bank on that answer they can get a huge lead.

RATING: 6
Probably the best party game I have ever played, which really isn't saying much.  I love the concept.  It works out very well and pretty much anyone will play it, which does make for a pretty fun game.

It does have one irritating flaw, though.  Since the number of rounds is fixed, everything basically comes down to the last question.  If you got screwed, you will have no shot at winning, and if you were lucky or good at guessing, you'll pretty much run away with the game.  That's not really my problem as it reflects poor/good play respectively.  However, if several people are at least close, then you basically have to bet everything on the last question because if you don't, the other person will eclipse your total and win.

Of course, this leads to some exceedingly anticlimactic games because you know nothing previous you did mattered much as long as everyone else is in the same boat you're in.  If it weren't for this, the game would be great.

The only way I can think of fixing this is having a variable number of questions each game so no one knows exactly when the game will end, meaning all bets could be very important.  Unfortunately, that probably would not be possible with this game because of the layout of the question cards.

Enjoyable and easily approachable trivia game.  We had played this to a point were we occasionally have to choose a new card due to familiar questions.  To let everyone play we use a new card for each question so the reader can't see the answer to upcoming questions.  despite this it hasn't been played in a while.  I bought the expansion questions to refresh the game and we haven't even used them.  May be time to revisit this game.

The trivia system is really original. A welcome change from Trival Pursuit and the like. At the same time, the selling point of the game (ie trivia for people who don't know stuff) brings an unsatisfactory wild guessing element to answering questions that detracts from the gameplay.
On the down side, most question are centered around America; so if you don't follow their culture or don't know your imperial unit of measure (like you shouldn't), you can have a hard time forming guesses.

RATING: 6.5
[North Star Games First (2005) edition] {Party; trivia, betting, paper-and-pencil; optimal 6p or more} A good trivia game but it's a pity that the questions are very biased to US environment. Players need not have the best knowledge to be winner because they can bet on the answers. Exact answers are not needed to get points. It's more interactive than other trivia games due to the betting. Players can sometimes bluff too. It's not very important to have players knowing the answers. Even if all players do not know the answer, it's still fun because it's enjoyable to guess / bet on the correct answer.

The bits are nicely made and effective. Make sure the pens are working before each game. The poker chips are big and sturdy. There are enough chips. The cubes are large and easily to be distinguished. I like the betting mat very much because it is durable and attractive. 100 question cards (total 700 questions) are given. They should be enough for many games but I would love to have more question cards. Hope that the publisher can continue to make more cards (and more international friendly)

If you don't know the answer the something, yeah you can bet on someone else's answer but at that point the game just feels random.

Always goes over well when I bring it to parties or group gatherings.  I own all varieties: Regular, family, and party versions.  My favorite way to play is with the family version questions with the regular version betting mat and chips.

The questions in the regular and party work well also but only if the people playing are American or familiar with American history/culture.

Far too often, I see people (myself included) end this game with the original 2 chips they had at the start and nothing else. That for me, makes this game a lot less fun.

We play a house rule which means that everyone has to go all in on the final round; this means that (a) those with only 2 chips have a chance of winning [yay!] and (b) that someone who has played well all through the game can lose because they don't know anything about the final question [boo!].

All in all, this is an entertaining enough filler, but I have no great love for it.

Probably works excellently with non-gamers, but if you've got enough gamers to play this game, you can play other stuff that's a bit more fun.  Though you most definitely need to limit betting on the final question.  To much rides on that answer.

2nd edition rules may fix the last question problem.

Ran a quiz version of this at a church gathering at my place. Had bible-based questions and a simpler bidding system, and everyone had a blast!

Played this once in Convic 08. Love the bidding mechanic, although in the end, the leader simply pushed his luck and bid everything on one answer. At that point, it felt like everything hinged on just that last turn, which raised the question of why bother with the previous 6 turns then!? Still, it's a great party game where no one needs to know the correct answers to win.

Wits and Wagers is an absolutely wonderful game for almost any number of people.  Some people in my game group always request it.  It's a lot of fun to see how people estimate various things, or to see what year people thinks various events happened - sometimes decades (or even centuries!) before or after their actual happening.  Great for groups of almost any size, although you may need to supply some of your own poker chips if you have extra players.

We generally add some of our own poker chips, and ignore the rule that allows players to bet only one or two chips each round.  Supposedly the new design/rules fix this, and maybe we'll use that, but for now, why not have fun the way we're doing it.

Maybe I need to give it more tries, but whackiness did not ensue when I played.  I don't see where the hilarity is supposed to come from.  Sure, sometimes there will be a crazy guess and you can hackle that person, but otherwise the wagering part has limited interaction.

Who wants to host a game show?  Wits and Wagers is the best board game for having a game show in your living room.  You don't have to be right, you just have to bet on who is CLOSEST to right!  This requires a strong host to be exciting; otherwise the process overcomes the enjoyment.  Five or more players are recommended.

I bought this to play with non-gamers, but the non-gamers still did not want to play. Guess this is why they are non-gamers. Honestly I shouldn't have wasted my time as the Trivia questions are pretty far fetched. This game makes me feel like nobody will every have the correct answer, you just have to bet on who will be closest. I prefer Trivia games where you either answer the questions correctly or incorrectly. Trying to be the closest to the correct just doesn't cut it for me. Here is an example of a question. "How fast does the Earth spin?". Here is an example of the type of trivia questions that I prefer ... "What is the only state in the United States of America which was at one time an Independent Country?"

Fast and fun with most groups of people (though the white boards get dangerous...after seven plays I've seen so many dry-erase dongs.)  I'll be playing this for quite some time, I imagine.  

My one major criticism is that the categories of the questions seem fairly scripted so far: you'll start with a geography question, and drift through sports, entertainment, etc. before finishing the game with an historical question.  As someone who does very well on history questions, this can give me a nice end-of-game advantage -- if I can stay reasonably competitive for the previous six rounds (so far, usually possible), then it's an easy thing to get the closest answer on the final question and bet enough to assure a win.  I suppose eventually my opponents will catch on and start just following my lead on the final question, but it would have been nice if the questions were more scrambled on the cards (scrambling them ourselves would be hard because the person reading the questions is usually playing, which necessitates reading from the top or the bottom.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great party game. You could make unlimited questions based on numbers, so it has far more longevity than many trivia type games. And you don't have to be good at trivia to win! Such a great game for big groups.

Pulled this out on New Years Eve 2010-2011. We had more than 21 players--some teams having up to five players. It didn't matter, everybody was loving it. I'm not a party-game lover, but this one really shines. I encourage it for large groups that want to be loud.

I've seen this come up in many a list as a good party game that gamer's can get behind.

I'd agree in so far as I enjoyed it well enough.

I'd disagree in so far as the people I have played it with, up till noe, seem to be indifferent in their reactions.

As a side note, I agree with the rulebook suggestion that says, don't explain it, just play a sample round. Much quicker and easier that way.

Fantastic party game. It is fun, easy, quick, can be played intoxicated and packs a surprising amount of strategy hidden behind simplistic trivia game facade. Bidding phase can get very tense, as you are torn apart between different choices and it often facilitates in a lot of laughter after an unexpected answer or an emotional outburst after missed close call. Each session has some spectacular moments, like the guy who is drunk and always writes his favorite number "37" on a card and scores a jackpot with question "How many plays did Shakespeare write?" or me missing the answer for the Earth's circumference by MEASLY 20 KILOMETERS and losing the game in the result.

RATING: 8
I agree with many others that this is a great party game. 

Update:  Stays an 8 and I still love this game and have very good success with others.  My top party game.

Update:  Stays an 8, but no longer my top party game.  Dixit has that distinction now.

It's still a trivia game at the end of the day and it can still intimidate or annoy people.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

Wits and Wagers is a party game that does a lot of things right.

The movie fan, sports freak or whatever one might specialize in,   has no definitive edge here.  Unlike most trivia games,  this is,  for the most part,  a level playing field.  While playing this,  the only possible downside is observing the stack of question cards as they inevitably dwindle. 

Like all games of this type,  replays are inherently non-existent.  Once the cards are exhausted - hopefully,  you will be too - because it's game over.  Still, questions that require a number as an answer are all that is needed to proceed. It is not impossible to create your own with a little due diligence if you have the desire to indulge in such a task.  In my opinion it may well be worth the effort.  

Highly recommend.

Gifted for my equally trivia minded twin brother, played with his wife and her cousin for the first time, all were on the gaming spectrum, from don't know/don't care about gaming to me.  Everyone had a good time with this game.  My twin and I are the most trivia minded guys of the bunch and we didn't win and had a better time than any Trivial Pursuit or Cranium game.  Must have for anyone.

RATING: 7
Good fun. It's nice to have something different for the Party game category. With smaller groups (i.e. not teams), this can be played very quietly without a lot of excitement. With larger groups, the timer becomes a factor and the discussion creates a fun dynamic. There's some strategy to this which makes it very cool for a party game, but it can also play a little too quietly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun trivia game that levels the playing field for those folks whose heads aren't full of useless junk.  Being able to bet on the person who you think best knows the answer evens things out - and a lot of the questions have surprising answers.  A good party game - popular with gamers and non-gamers alike.

Having the first pressing of first edition with the "mousepad" betting mat is a nice plus.

I needed a party game to pull out for people that would otherwise never play a boardgame (without a lot of coaxing, anyway).  Thank goodness this game not only fulfills that requirement but makes me feel good about my investment!  Its loads of fun with any people (team games are a blast), appeals to the gamblers, the trivia-nerds, and just about everyone else who likes to engage in social activities.

(NH)
Grade: A-.  The trivia game that really does work with everyone, and takes whatever you throw at it (in terms of party size).  

As far as party games go, it's inferior (for laughs, etc) to Time's Up, but it's the best trivia game I've ever played.  You get some fun questions in there, you have a way to compete even if you haven't the slightest clue about the answer, and the game never overstays its welcome.  It also doesn't feel "gambly," despite its theme, which helps allay the fears of the less-Vegas-inclined.  It does feel a bit weird, though, to have a trivia game where the answers are all numbers.  Initial rating is a 7, but the forecast for this one is good as I feel out the game's dynamics with different groups.
[UPDATE--01-19-2009] I've played W&W several more times with small groups, and in each situation I've felt that my initial rating of 7 was judicious.  But we recently experienced a revelatory first huge-group play with 25 people--23 of whom were non-gamers who were shocked we would think of playing a game with that many people.  But the game scaled like a champion and with teams the game develops a significant extra dimension.  Rating up 1.5 from 7 to 8.5.

This isn't a very good game, and it was a huge flop at our Christmas. I wouldn't have guessed that by the rules, but once playing, it just didn't work. First, 4 of the 7 dry erase pens didn't work out of the package, so immediately we had to share pens and couldn't use the timer. Then, after 3 rounds, we ran out of poker chips. We had three players with well over 200 points, and if I had played for the kill, I would have had over 1,000 by the end of the game. We just stopped playing for points at that point. There are other problems, but I'll leave it at that.

I enjoy this game a fair amount, Wits and Wagers is a good party game and I like the fact that you bid on stuff so you don't need to know the correct answer, and you can hedge your bets. It works well as a party game, and while it might not be as crazy as some games, it means that you can talk while you play and aren't just laughing the whole time, so it's a bit more low key than some.

Party game. Language independent as long as at least one of the players speaks English.

As with all games with questions, you'll do better the more answers you know. The twist here is that you'll also do better if you guess who knows each question. But in the end that idea fails as most questions are so ridiculus that NOONE has a clue about them, and all end up answering random. You can still manoever a bit by probabilities and risk assessment but it's like driving blind.

A greek version might redeem this game for me, but as it is now even the questions are uninteresting and boring.

Got to be my least favorite "party" game I've played yet.  I love party games but not this one.  The whole "Don't need to know any trivia" is BS.

Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas of 2005.  This is an excellent party game, and significantly better than any other trivia game.  However, I can't rate it higher than a 7 because while it is a "good game" and I am "usually willing to play," I can't say that I "will never turn down a game" because it's only good for certain circumstances.  Still, I think this is a very clever design, and I enjoy playing this game very much.

Great little trivia game... actually I don't know if I can call it a trivia game. Most of the questions are so abstract that you are pretty much guessing the answer to the question. Then the game begins. This is actually a great little bluffing and deceiving game. The best way to make your money is being able to determine who best knows the right answer, and betting on theirs. It's a neat twist on a trivia game, and can be quite a bit of fun.

RATING: 6
All I knew about Wits & Wagers was that I'd heard it referred to as a "party game". And that's about right... which isn't a knock against it. It does that fairly well.

Each person reads a question on their turn, which has some number as an answer. Everybody makes their best guess, without going over, and writes it on their card. Then the cards are arranged from lowest to highest. There are points for getting the answer right, but everyone can also bet on which answers are right. The more extreme answers pay better, but are probably less likely to be right. You can only bet twice a turn, 10 bucks to two different (or the same) answers. On the last turn you can go all in, giving most everyone a shot at a comeback.

The game suffers from the drawback of most trivia games... as we had to answer questions as though we were living in 2007. I liked the game, but the fact that it was fairly dated did cut into the enjoyment a good bit.

A trivia game where you don't really need to know trivia - so the advertising says!  I had this rated much higher when I played with gamers, but after playing with non-gamers, it dropped drastically.  Non-trivia players can really be made to feel dumb since they must provide an answer for every question.  In a normal trivia game you can just not answer when not knowing, but not here, you have to give an answer.  When you are so far off the correct answer over and over again and get the comments, you can really feel dumb.

A bit dry for a party game.  I thought I'd like it more than I did.  It never seems to come down to the wire, but it plays quick and lets a group play a trivia game without getting bogged down in some marathon game with pie pieces (shudder).

Played three times, late at night at bgg.con, with 7 players.  Loads of fun, lots of laughing, great questions.  One interesting twist, if it's too obvious to other players that you know the answer to a question that they don't, they'll all just bet on your answer.  This happened, when I FINALLY got a question that was easy for me, the year of independence of India.  So I'm Indian, and everyone knew this, and as a result, I just got $10 more than everyone else, who bet on me.  Wonderful fun.

I had high hopes for this game, but it came out a little flat. Perhaps we weren't drunk enough or we weren't in a ruckus mood. In either case, the game was very rote and folks weren't laughing or cheering as much. Perhaps Say Anything suits our group more. The biggest concern we had was that the betting was not really that high tension and there is very little motivation to compete. Odd....not a hit

6 is about right. I am on the fence on tis one. Not heavy but not very excting either

Tried a brief demo at BGG.CON 05 and gave to Terri for Christmas 05.  This looks like it might be my kind of trivia game, since I am so bad at trivia.

We just tried our first full game, and there we no surprises.  The game works as well as the demo made it sound.  It is also a fast game so it can be picked up quickly and played as an openner or closer.

I'm eager to try this out after seeing my church kids love this game, but still haven't played it myself. The one flaw I'm cautious about is that it seems sort of awkward if everyone knows you know the answer, which did come up once during the session I observed (yes, I know the year, month, date of MLK's "I Have a Dream" speech)

Edit: And after Say Anything, I'm pretty reluctant to break this game out. Maybe I need the right set of party people to enjoy this, but it feels like it's a party game for gamers... in which case, I'd rather play an actual game. And I'll play Say Anything if I need a party game for just anyone. (hey, at least same company, right?)

Edit 2: I've now used this with youth groups, and I like the game much more. I think the main problem is that most American Ph.Ds will get a lot of the more historical questions down (the first set of questions themed American History #2). I also play without the betting variant, which I think adds unnecessary complexity.

Pros: wagering mechanic integrated with trivia, a party group for medium-sized groups, limited rounds means quick playtime, more tactical decision-making than most party games

Cons: not a strategy game, the best trivia buff wins the majority of the time

Definitely one of the best party games, and a trivia game that everyone can enjoy!

Most enjoyment I've had playing trivia.  Since all the answers are numbers, you can get kids and grandparents to play.  The betting makes it more enjoyable than just playing trivia.  The ability to form teams allows the game to scale up to large groups.  I highly recommend trying this one.

RATING: 7.5
Quick, easy to grasp, party trivia game where players don't actually have to know anything to win. A hit every time it was introduced. Can handle 7 teams (either singles or up to 3 players per team) + 1 "gameshow host". Questions have numerical answers - players secretly record their answers on dry-erase boards, reveal them, then wager on which answer they believe is correct. Payout odds are based on the spread of the numerical answers as ordered on the playing felt. Good poker chips really enhance play.

Good for a party game is still just that -- only good for a party game.  Unlike a lot of other gamers, this is not even close to my favorite party game.  More interesting from a gamer's perspective than most party games, but that's not really the function I want from my party games.  I miss the team structure that you get from a lot of party games, and betting on the correct answer doesn't get me.  When I actually am in the mood for a party game (which isn't frequent, admittedly), I would rather have some free-form activity, and Wits and Wagers is a bit too restrictive, and not creative enough for what I really like.

Played it once and liked it, mostly cause it was short. For the time it takes, there is some excitement in trying to guesstimate the answer to the question (or the satisfaction of already knowing the answer). In the end does it succeed as a "game"? Meh, not sure. But as an occasional light experience I appreciate it.

There are some weird swings in the game that I don't like (the all-in betting at the end, for example), and there's too much of a chance that you're out of the game before it even gets interesting, but it's a clever idea.  I'd like to play it some more to see if it retains its shine.

This is an easy 10. The only reason I docked 0.25 points is due to the slight US bias in the questions. Its a game for everyone.

The best part about this is that it creates memories. Remember that one time so-and-so wrote that the Sistine Chapel wasn't painted until 1860? Or how about that time when so-and-so said that man hadn't explored beyond Mars until 2004? etc.

You will laugh till you cry. This needs to be in every gamer's collection.

EDIT: Rating lowered. Its still very good but it has lost some of its initial shine. I have found that this is one of those games needs the right group to make it fun.

Trivia for People Who Don't Know Stuff!
\13\\13\
Not a trivia buff? It doesn’t matter! Each player writes a guess to a question such as "In what year did the bikini swimsuit makes its first appearance?" or "How many feet wide is an NFL football field?" and places it face-up on the betting mat. Think you know the answer? Bet on your guess. Think you know who the experts are? Bet on their guess. The closest answer pays out according to the odds on the betting mat. Strike it big and you’ll be cheering like you just hit the jackpot!

Wits & Wagers is a trivia game that lets you bet on anyone’s answer. So you can win by making educated guesses, by playing the odds, or by knowing the interests of your friends. It can be taught in 2 minutes, played in 25 minutes, and accommodates up to 20 people in teams.

This is trivia done right!  I love the way everything ties together in this one and how everyone still has a chance to earn points even if they had no idea what the correct answer was when they initially wrote something down.

I'm not usually a fan of trivia games, but Wits & Wagers manages to avoid my major issue with them: having to actually know the exact answers. Every round, the (always numerical) answers that players have given for a question are revealed, allowing everyone to choose which answer in the pool is the closest to being correct. The owner of each answer is revealed afterwards, and credit is given to the player that originally suggested the winning number as well as anyone who bet on it being right. This system allows for more interaction between players than in a standard trivia game, which bumps up the score for me a little.

About as good a party/trivia game as I've seen.  Not as much pure fun as Time's Up, but still accessible and not overbearing.  The "all in" final round is not a good thing, as it seriously devalues the prior six, and even casual gamers notice this.  I'm thinking escalating limts (a la Hold 'Em) is the best solution.

as neither a particular trivia or gambling fan I was pleasently surprised by this game which combines the 2 things, I bought it from boardgames with scott, scott's reccomendations to play at an upcoming games day where they will be a few non gaming hangers on  as well as the usual hard core group, I am pretty sure it will go do well with both crowds, my one small niggle is that the questions are geared to an american rather than a more international audience, as a gamer I can flip-flop between metric and imperial measurements in my head with comparative ease but not every one can do this, taht said  its a worthy purchase for a game to play with a mixed crowd and much fun with a short play time

The first time I played W&W I didn't really care for it that much, it seemed to lack... substance. However, we've played it several times and it really steps up to the plate for replay ability something I find most trivia games lack. Most likely it's due to the same thing I thought was a problem the first time. Games are short, bite-sized for trivia games, that still satisfy. Lending themselves to doing four or five games in a row to try and find an ultimate winner. In all, a unique play experience for trivia games.

Some things are a bit American centric so looses some interest with Aussie as they just don't care about thing. Imperial units can throw under many under 50's too.

Like the concept that you have to get near the right number, but be sure to be not to high. Don't like the betting. And especially the "all in" rule make the game quite pointless.

Questions too US-specific to be of any use outside the USA

Note: rating partly based on plays of "Gambit 7", which since got its own entry. But even for this game, the last question is the only one that really matters.

I love this game and Say Anything in that you can still do well if you don't have the right answer, as long as you can guess and bid on the right answer. What I dislike about this game when compared to Say Anything is the relatively obscure or math/science basis for the questions. I found that I often had no idea what to guess so I would be playing totally randomly, which is less fun than if you at least have a vague estimate or a range of possible guesses to write down. I suppose that aspect was frustrating. I also sometimes had a hard time guessing. It's the smart man's version of Say Anything and I suppose I'm just not always smart.

Great game! Rewards smart players without punishing the dummies. Playing the odds and having good estimations / hunches will always put you in position to win. Nitpick: I wish the final question wasn't always a winner-take-all proposition, but I don't know how to avoid that in a wagering game. A maximum bet would solve that problem but would be unnecessarily restrictive.

I don't like typical trivia games, and I'm not much for betting games either, but we liked playing this with our friends.  I like not having to rely on my answer only.  It's also interesting to see how often, or for what reason, people bet on their own answers or the answers of other people.  For example, I'm inclined to bet on the answers of a particular friend just because I think he's good with facts.  Did it help?  Not really!

I thought I would like this more; maybe more than Balderdash. But I thought it was a little dull with 4 players unlike Balderdash. I suspect it to be better with the full compliment of players though.

I'm generally not keen on party games, but this one isn't bad.  The main reasons: (a) it's fun, (b) nearly anyone can play, and possibly even win, and (c) games typically last 20-30 minutes, which is the exact length of time that I'm willing to dedicate to a party game.

RATING: 7
Interesting betting and guessing about trivia. If you ever get to see or play in the Game Show version at a convention, do it. With a game show host giving away extra prizes just for laughs, it is a hoot.

RATING: 7
Played once (with 5 players). An interesting trivia/party game, where general culture plays an important, but not dominating role. Unfortunately, too many of the questions during my single play were US-centric and my answers could only be wild guesses.

RATING: 8.5
As party games go, this is pretty much the best there is.

It's a great twist on your typical trivia game because you don't need to know the right answers to do well.  You just have to be good at figuring out who does have the answer.

I just don't get the fascination with this game. Others of my group love it. Possibly because I'm the world's worst guesser and I lose all the time.

My favorite party/trivia game--by far.  Knowing the answers will certainly help you win, but even if you don't you can strategize a best guess. Probably won't even make anybody feel stupid (except for those date questions that you  think you should really know).

Good party-style game. The version I played was a bit too American for us, so it didn't work quite as well as hoped. I imagine an edition tailored to its audience would be more fun.

My favorite party game. It's a little too easy to get ahead and stay ahead if you just play conservatively, but nobody ever cares who wins when it's over with because everyone is focused on who wrote the dumbest answer. Great fun.

The wagering part is an interesting (though not well-balanced) twist on trivia. Fortunately, fun trumps balance for a party game, and this one delivers it in spades.

Wonderful trivia type party game.  To succeed you don't need to know trivial answers.  You just need to bet on who you think does know.  I hate trivia games as a rule.  This one is a fabulous exception.

RATING: 7
Very nice little party game.  The betting mechanic this game centers around is a nice way to play with a typical trivia game.  You don't necessarily need to know the answer as long as you've can get close, or you know who does.  There are some issues with precise rules on how placing bets works when you're playing with a more competitive group, but it tends to work out and the drama created by betting it all late in the game for the win is fantastic.

While definitely a party game, it does it well and everyone I've played with always has a good time and wants to play again or purchase it for themselves.

Definitely a keeper for any entertainers out there.

Might be fun with the right group. Problem is, it is a "family game," but if you play in that setting it is always almost trivially easy to figure out who has the correct answer for any given situation.  There is just very little fun in that.  Pass.

Get Grandma, the 12 year old, your wife and your parents out for this one.  No one has to be a savant nor do they have to be lucky to win.  A great spin on a trivia game leading to great interaction and discussion around the table after each question is finalized.

Wow this game rocks. I hate trivia, but was convinced this game is worth owning. It is. You don't have to know the answer to the questions because you wager on the answers everyone writes down. Brilliant. I love that I can lean heavily on betting, although I have gotten a few right :cool:

This game is the only one I can get my grandma to play. We usually play it seven times in a row!! I hate playing ANY game more than twice in a row. This is another game I think everyone should own.

Very clever, engaging and fairly novel party game. Nice light trivia and interesting wagering process involved. One problem is that some folks will invariably play "The Price is Right" and make obscenely low bids just to undercut what they think other people will do -- putting emphasis on that sort of mind game over legitimate attempts to provide reasonable answers. Despite some poor production decisions and the bidding issues with some players or groups, Wits & Wagers does far more right than wrong, and is an enjoyable way to spend the evening with friends.

Played it for the first time over the holidays with my family. GREAT fun! A short play-time plus  the fact that it's a trivia game for those who DON'T KNOW the answers (!) = LOTS of fun and laughter at the table! The only game we played multiple sessions of on our vacation!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an OK party game.  One thing that gives it merit is that it is like Trivial pursuit with a twist.  It no longer matters that I don't know the answers.  As long as I can guess which answer is closest to the best, I have a chance of winning.

Our party bag was pretty light... so light that we rarely bothered to bring it out at parties.  So after reading a couple reviews I picked this up and have not been dissappointed!  The odd questions and outgessing other people's guessing and betting strategies make for a really fun game... but the more I play the more disappointed I am with the Casino style scoring.  I should really upgrade to the Party edition some time.

RATING: 7
Took the mundane trivia genre and spiced it up with gambling.  I guess the sense of risk vs. reward really does bring out the competitive side of people.  Not a bad way to spend a night with the non-gamers, certainly less dry and dull than the standard Trivia Pursuit.

Wits and Wagers could easily become a favorite in our circle of "non-gamer" friends.  I'd likely use it as a gateway game, but even gamers will appreciate its departure from standard trivia games.

RATING: 6
It's not too thrilling with few players, since the answers are few, and the odds give weak payouts.  With more players, the swing of the odds is greater.  I think increasing the bet regulator on turns 1 through 6 should increase the excitement.  Still, great concept!

Update:  As expected, a seven-player game is a lot of fun!

I think that with fewer than seven players, players should take turns giving bonus answers not in their color - in other words, no credit for having the "right" answer.  It would keep the payouts more interesting.

RATING: 7
In the party game genre, an outstanding game all around.  I really enjoy both this and Say Anything, however my group tends to prefer Say Anything.  I can see us playing both of these again very soon.  Great games guys!

As an aside, every gamer needs these in their collection.  Not only are they great games, but fit a need when playing with nongamers and casual gamers.  After playing through various games to minimal success, some folks just aren't going to be into euros no matter hard you push.

Don't bother trying to explain all the rules before you get started, you're much better off just walking people through a practice round. I pulled this out at a family gathering and some people were wandering away by the time I finished explaining. By the end of the first game, they were all back and wanting to join in. Fun for everyone.

A fun party game that encourages more of a relaxed feel than the frenetic atmosphere created by most party games.

Enjoyable party game. Essentially the love child of Trivial Pursuit and poker, Wits & Wagers is silly, interesting and a great time waster. Not much more one can ask for in a party game, I suppose.

Edit: 12/23/14
Kind of hate this game now. I've become exposed to so many different board games that these older, less complex one hold much less appeal.

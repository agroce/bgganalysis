Beautiful block game - Played the opening scenario which is really the highpoint of mobility for the Germans. Great game with excellent fog of war due to combat strengths up to 20 and the ability to shuttle them all over you territory in your strategic phase

Didn't like how easy it is switch units around. For me, it turned it from a WW1 game into a guessing game. Gorgeous looking title that I wanted to love but ended up feeling meh about. Sold.

RATING: 3.9
Real nice components. Rules not that clear or well-written. Gameplay is a pain with the  constant blocks manipulation. Shifting SPs around, throwing dice, bluffing with artillery and air, that's about it. Killer stacks. Didn't feel like a wargame. Really disappointed although I understand that block lovers rave about it. Not for me.

This WWI game should be subtitled "Fields of Disappointment," for disappointing it is.  Do not let the well-done components lead you astray, for there is zero energy or excitement in how the game plays.  I need to exercise more self-discipline and remind myself that a set of nice components doth not a good game make.  Although the game has been a bust for me, the designer, Kurt, is a nice person.  When it comes to the ratings' game, I think nice can matter.

The many ways the game encourages these super-large offensives that end up just making the gameplay weird has now caught up with Fields of Despair. Unless we get some rules updates, this will be consigned to the closet or the trade bin.
---
Fields of Despair I think has to be categorized as a near-miss. There is undoubtably a lot of really good stuff in here. But there are just too many mechanical rough edges, and too many anti-intuitive gamy tactics. I've talked about the end of the world problem; but there are a bunch of other little niggling things that irritate me: how the initiative player can totally neuter large forces with 1SP spoiling moves, the weird throw-away flank pinning attacks (also launched with 1SP), the generally odd weakness of trenches, the vulnerability of the game to breakdown when the attacker unrealistically concentrates his forces into heavily overloaded spearheads which are not really stoppable in the game most of the time - even with decent forces in trenches.

I still want to keep playing with the game because so much in here is interesting, but on balance my optimism has flipped to thinking that, while clever in many ways, this is not really going to work out in the end.
---
Played 4 times at this point; 3 of 1914, one of 1915-1916. I've always really enjoyed it. The air reconnaissance combined with strategic redeployment gives the game a great sense of danger and high tension level. The abstract naval and Russian front rules work quite nicely. Economics are really tight and the choices are tough. The game really encourages you to be aggressive, which is nice.

My one concern about the game is that it doesn't seem to tolerate players perusing extreme strategies all that well - stripping some areas almost entirely to create massively overloaded spearheads in other sectors. Trenchlines are not as strong as you might expect and offensives made of 40+SPs and backed by artillery are basically irresistible unless you've really guessed lucky (and you are likely to get wiped out without inflicting meaningful attrition). If one player decides to overload the other side can only really counter by overloading a different front it seems to me, and from there a weird game develops as both sides rush into revolving door offensives. Anyway, I'm not totally sure. My main opponent for this game has a really aggressive play style and likes to strip the front down to 1SP to enable huge offensives, and I'm not really sure the game handles this style all that well. It doesn't break the game per se, but it does make it feel a bit weird.

Having said all that, I've enjoyed this game quite a lot and would recommend you try it if you like block games and have an interest in the topic. The three phases of the war are all covered in interesting and different ways that have substantially different feels, which is cool. To the degree that the game isn't totally authentic, it's all in service of making it interesting and engaging, and I'm good with that kind of trade-off. The production values are great. The rules are a bit uneven and could use a v2, but it's not too bad. I don't know if it's a long-term winner, but in the short term there is a lot to like.
---
Just one play in, but I think this has a lot of potential. We really enjoyed the tension and limited intelligence of the 1914 scenario, and I'm hopeful later scenarios will be interesting as well - unlike a lot of wargames on both WWI and WWII, this doesn't seem over-designed for the early years of the war.

Some unfortunate squishiness in the rules, though, which is a slight red flag (maybe a yellow flag?). They're at least 90+% very good, but the couple areas they're not good they're really not good. The designer is on the forums so ask.

Anyway, looking forward to exploring this. I hope it will pan out.

Großartiges Blockgame. Durch die große Spanne von Stärkepunkten weiß man einfach nie, was einen erwartet. Elemente wie Luftaufklärung sind ein großartiges Detail in diesem Spiel. Dadurch können Blöcke aufgedeckt werden und der Zug, der sonst nur durch Raten erfolgt, kann etwas geplant werden. So noch nie in einem Spiel gehabt. Bluffen wird in diesem Spiel groß geschrieben, durch Artillerie und Flugzeugmarker mit Werten von Null. Man weiß einfach nie, was einen erwartet, wenn man nicht über eine gute Luftaufklärung verfügt. Zusätzlich brennt es als Deutscher einfach an viel zu vielen Ecken. Großartiges Wargame!

Components: amazing, good blocks, good board
Complex: not hard for these kind of games, but not an easy game
Weight: heavy game
Players: 2
Length: 3 hours per scenario
Mechanics: block wargame
Decisions: all you can think and more
Opinion: loved the game from the first time I started to read about it, and continue after played.
Game about the western front in the Great War, and you have to play with the allies or the Central Powers. Would say the standard block game, with lot of rolls and lot of strategy, but we have some exceptions.
My main thought is that this game is about bluffing, the bluff is basic. Difference with other block games is that here the blocks can be between 0 and 20 (against the standard 0 to 4), therefore you don't know what you have in front, moreover, at the end of the turn you have a phase of Strategic Movement, and everything could change. This is the first part that amaze me.
More things, your personal board, also secret from the other player (you have to trust him, but where is the joy to play with someone you don't trust?). And there you have several tracks, some technology and some tracks for maintenance, what you do there is just limited to your Economy.
Then, the artillery and aviation, simplified rules but let you feel the Great War. The way you "bomb" the opponent has also some bluff, placing counters on the board and showing them afterwards. Similar thing with the aviation, but in this case its main function is to discover what the other player has.
More things, you have also the Eastern Front and the Naval Warfare represented in the game, although a bit abstracted. A couple of tracks and two bags to draw cubes from them, as said, a bit abstracted but you have the feeling that something is happening in the East and the submarines are doing something out there.
I could talk more and more about it, but just resume it that this is an amazing block game, representing the feelings of the Great War (not simulating it) and with tons of bluff

Me ha gustado bastante. Tiene elementos que me encantan.....Bloques, gestión de recursos y tecnología, campaña larga y escenarios cortos ..... Reseñar positivamente las mecánicas abstractas sobre el frente del este y la guerra naval, todo un acierto. Tiene sin embargo un handicap, y es la organización que se hace de los valores de los bloques. Tanto en el movimiento como en la fase de reorganización se puede cambiar el valor de los bloques ocultos con mucha tranquilidad, lo que imposibilita el juego competitivo.....y el otro si me tiras de la lengua.....Un juego para caballeros , para tiempos más civilizados......

The rules are straightforward and easy to understand.  The game features multiple aspects of World War I, including the use of air reconnaissance, impact of the Eastern Front on Central Powers manpower, submarine warfare, the introduction of tanks and stosstruppen and, of course, the entry of U.S. ground forces on the Western Front.  I am a former owner of "Paths of Glory" and although I enjoyed that game, I found it often bogged down in the Eastern Front and the Middle East while the Western Front was too static.  "Fields of Despair" is focused on the Western Front and give players a great opportunity to use the game's simple but brilliant system to go well beyond a mere hex-and-counter dog pile.

Mercy, GMT has been releasing beautiful games the last three years or so (they have been doing so for quite a while, but particularly the last few years). I was trying to resist this one, but finally pulled the trigger - I knew I'd regret it if I didn't. The game is physically stunning...one of the best GMT has done in this regard. The reason I bought it, however, was because it looked like a unique and interesting design. A different take on the block game, with its own personality. Truly looking forward to playing.

RATING: 6
Rating is based on one game as Allied Powers. The game looks great, a lot of detail has been put into it. Rules well laid down, and not a difficult game to learn.  

I played the campaign and was steam rolled by the Central Powers.  The CP have initiative, and a bigger army + better logistic points - this combined with quite some high mobility makes it very difficult for the AP to defend (the designer incentivize the AP to attack but this is suicide against a competent CP player).  This very high mobility means f.i. that cavalry units can run behind lines and cut supply, in what seems to be very gamey.  In the first turns the CP are really at the edge of snatching all the necessary VP's   -  The fog of War makes this less obvious as the AP does not know for sure where the forces are on the board, but is certainly a small step for the CP to win the game and a very difficult game for the AP to prevent that, other than bad dice.

It is also relatively easy for the CP to concentrate forces and go straight to Paris, whilst keeping its supply line intact (they do have more units and more strength).  

I short I found the game out of balance. I do want to try more, this is a gorgeous game with very interesting long term aspects, including a technology tree to develop planes f.i.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Contender for the best wargame of 2017. The fog of war is excellent, and the moving of units around means that the fog is very thick. It means the gambling is always risky, and it means that sometimes you get some very un-world war one action that happens where lines get smashed because the enemy bled the trenches dry and left themselves exposed. The dogfighting with planes, and all the bells and whistles are just so much fun. And the production value is some of the best by GMT since Liberty or Death.

This is a very well made block game that offers both players difficult decisions: where to allocated combat forces and where to allocate technology. Will airpower be the priority because it gives a reconnaissance advantage or to some other area to give the troops on the ground some assistance. It's obvious the designer put a lot of effort into this one.

RATING: 8.5
I've played the 1st turn of the campaign game with my son. I really liked the game. The rules are overall simple, easy to learn and follow. The block density wasn't so high, but the fact the blocks are kept up most of the time creates uncertainty and tension. The components are solid With some practice and with an opponent that plays a bit faster, I think the full campaign is playable in a reasonable amount of time.

Playtester: 
A unique block game, and a unique game about WWI. Familiar concepts about blocks are used here, as are other familiar wargame concepts. The full war scenario takes about 10hrs, but there are shorter scenarios. 

Ultimately, I think FoD has an interesting 4X style game engine at it's core. This game isn't just a matter of managing one front of the war in a limited way, but rather managing empires entirely. Interesting things are done with air units, tech developments, supply, and the Eastern front.

Ausgesprochen gelungene Adaption und kreative Weiterentwicklung des Columbia-Blocksystems für die Belange des Ersten Weltkrieges. Unmittelbar simuliert wird zwar 'nur' die Westfront, durch abstrakte Mechanismen berücksichtigt das Spiel aber auch andere Kriegsschauplätze, insbesondere den U-Boot-Krieg und die Ostfront. Da die Blöcke eine Stärke von 0 bis 24 (!) aufweisen können, wird Fog of War hier großgeschrieben.

RATING: 9
Based on a couple FTF matches and 1 solo game with playtest copy:

This is a block game, so your opponent doesn't know how strong you are at any point in your line. The blocks do not have set values, ie it's not like you KNOW there are a bunch of strength 6 blocks, with an 8 every now and then. ANY block may range from 0-20, and you can have 3 blocks in a hex. Looking at a front line, you have no idea where the enemy strength is (or his weak areas).

This is where air recon comes in. Air units flip blocks BEFORE you have to move. Of course, your air is limited to 6 counters, and the enemy can use some of HIS air to dogfight YOUR air.  The mechanism is brilliant. If this were a normal wargame with counters and no hidden info, what good would air power do in a WWI game? But with blocks, air is VITAL to figure out where to attack.

The game really gives you a feel for the period. 

Huge assaults are launched, strength points galore are wiped out.  The 1914 scenario is very mobile, there are no ZoCs, so any hole in your lines will be ruthlessly exploited.  In the later scenarios, trench warfare dominates the battlefield, and the lines are locked.  

Another really cool mechanism. Once trench warfare begins, in the combat phase, you can fire your artillery, see how it goes, and then attack with infantry-- or not. Some times both sides just sat in their trenches, shelled each other, and left it at that. You are never forced to send your men 'over the top.'

Each side builds tech in tanks and Stosstruppen, hoping to break the stalemate. Naval warfare, UBoats and the Russian front are semi-abstracted, but play a large role in what military and economic resources reach the front. 

This game should be well received when it is released.

RATING: 4
Lovely components, and very interesting systems for recon and artillery usage, as well as a nicely abstracted approach to the Eastern front and the war at sea.  Unfortunately, I just don't see anything in the history to justify the way strength points fly all over the map during redeployment, and in practice it is tedious to manipulate them constantly.  Also is an exceptionally poor solitaire experience (not referring to the solo scenario, which I haven't tried), which I actually find unusual for block games.  I'll keep an eye out on the system and the designer, but I don't think this one works.

Interesting concept with the 20 step blocks. The WW1 felling of despair is good represented and very present. The artillery system and the air reconnaissance are innovative, elegant implemented and interesting. But after two short games I’m not sure if the concept is my kind of thing, I like more the Blitzkrieg movement of units. In turn 1 to 3 this is still possible and in my first game I forced a CP surrenders in turn 2 with the destruction of his southern flank. After turn 4 the Trenches give the defender an enormous advantage and reduce the attractiveness of attacks with small forces. But I will give the game more trys.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The Germans are basically forced to conduct the Schlieffen Plan by the terrain, whilst France is forced to thin out their southern lines to reinforce their northern approaches to match the German offensives. Any other plan has little to no chance of success. Rivers and trenches aren't as powerful as one would expect from the First World War, but then again the Great War was a meatgrinder, where the key to offensives and defences was feeding in ever more men and artillery. This limits replayability, with any variances resulting more from the luck of rolling and strategic mismanagement of forces.

The fog of war in this game is fantastic, with unlimited strategic redeployment and reconnaissance flights adding a massive layer of uncertainty and risk–taking. The technology and various maintenance, supply, and logistics points are perhaps the strongest part of the game, besides the fog of war. How each player approaches their economic investments will radically alter the course of the conflict. Will you invest in stoßtruppen or tanks early, or will you resort to poison gas? I'm not a fan of how they handled the Eastern Front, since it involves no real decision making and can (potentially) end the game at any time, arguably for either side.

Played the Solitaire Scenario at the GMT Weekend April 2016.  A very challenging game that is quite engaging.  For solo gamers, the designer has developed a brilliant  AI system that will make  unexpected moves like a human player would do -- attacking unexpectedly in front line areas with varying amounts of forces.  

A very clever design that emulates WWI Western Front Warfare using block armies. The Air War, Submarine Warfare, Production, and Technology are abstracted in a elegant and easy to track/implement manner.  For a first publishing effort from a new designer,  This is a bold and beautiful game entry in WWI history.

This is one of my favorite block games.

GMT WWI hex encouner block war game on the western front. with a count down where US enters. Insanely high valued blocks. Uses cube pouch pulling for German naval warfare in production phase and for the eastern front track leading to the Russian revolution.  Managing resource cubes is a little odd. Lots of steps with economy, trench, artillery & air warfare, and types of units and fortifications to keep track of.  Heavy lift for me.

RATING: 10
Quite simply my favourite miniatures game and certainly the game I play more than any other. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.79
Just learning to play this with an experienced tournament player.  Loving the open ended system that can allow armies from anytime/place to battle.  The rule book can be a bit vague at time so it's nice to have a player and resources like the Yahoo group, The Stronghold, etc. for reference.

RATING: 4
Excellent fantasy battle game that can be used to model many fantastic armies for balanced games. Lackluster presentation and a dearth of support take this game down. A good gateway into miniatures wargaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great enhancement to DBA since the variable size of armies (from 6? - 24 elements) makes asymmetric battlers, which I like. Unfortunately still uses original DBA contact rules and has not been updated to DBA3/DBMM style contact rules. Prefer historical theme of DBA/M/MM.

RATING: 7
Love it even more than DBA if that's possible. The breadth and variety of the army lists included is simply amazing. There is enough here to keep a modeler busy for years... Glen Cook armies anyone? How about Erickson's Malazan books, they're perfectly adaptable.

Built a 25-28mm "Gothic" army including Flying Buttresses. Now to finish my "Egyptian" army. They double as a chess set.

I like the DBA rules set.  It's my second favourite miniatures game.  Hordes is my favourite - it has everything DBA has, except you can also custom build your own armies!  A great little system.  Some of the game can be a little luck dependant - but by and large it' a great fun, quick game.

RATING: 8
This is a new thing for me - a lightweight tabletop wargame that plays quickly. I'm sure it is not a super accurate simulation but it is fun which counts for a lot in my book. I will be playing again.

favorite war game ever, only played 10mm but at that level it's great fun, and quick and easy to paint.
As a rule system it's so simple and fun, and the variety is enough to be interesting without getting confusing

Good fun, it really shines as a multiplayer with multiple generals per side, also campaign seems promising but not tried it yet, Not as complex as the overly verbose rulebook makes it seem.

An excellent, simple yet subtle wargame - playable in an hour (or less, often). Recommended if you want to play with your toy soldiers without having to refer to acres of charts and tables.

The best easy fantasy miniatures rules. Jimzik standed several of my armies for me but we don't play it as often as we should.  I'd like to work it into a dungeon adventure sometime!

RATING: 8
The fantasy cousin to DBA and a must own in my book.  Again, the notion of an obtuse form of the Queen's english comprising the text of the rules causes unnecessary confusion.  It isn't hard to play or understand, it simply requires careful reading.  For instance, the nature of magic and spellcasting is called "bespelling."  Outside of these rules I had never read nor heard of the term and when a hero is "bespelled" and such it quickly stops the flow of the text and causes the yankee reader to pause.  Excellent simple rule set where magic is a small portion-not the primary force on the field.  Again a clearly written text would further serve to clarify unnecessary confusion from such a simple and clever set of rules.

RATING: 6.5
Fantasy DBA, a great little game that showed that minis gaming didn't need to be complicated, expensive, or take itself too seriously. Despite that, and the seemingly small number of units it really does have a surprising amount of depth. The only downside is that post combat movement can turn into a bit of a rules quagmire.

Based only on a read-through.

I have to say that the system is astonishingly flexible. You can create ANYTHING you may imagine. Now maybe spells could have been implemented.

not a bad game. but waaayyy too dry for fantasy. just does not feel like fantasy for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fantasy version of DBA (De Bellis Antiquitatis).  There are a few minor rules differences between the two versions that are not related to the addition of fantasy troop types, and which I think improve the game.  Therefore, I slightly prefer this game over DBA.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
An outstanding game that accurately reflects regimental combat in a fantasy setting. Balanced, fast, and fun.
Those converned about dicing for command pips should consider that mechanic represents the uncertainty of warfare and can be planned for by grouping elements together and minimizing drains like wizards, artillery, fliers, and hordes replacement. With a proper battle line, you can maneuver an entire army with only 1 pip; it's when you begin spreding forces thin that things get tougher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really like this set of rules.  We really need more generic rules sets in the world.  On the downside the book is very hard to understand.  If you want to try this, definitely find someone to show you how to play instead of trying to learn on your own.

RATING: 8

My favorite fantasy miniatures game. It doesn't take a lot of figs and it is playable in an hour if you can get the "simple" rules down to where it flows. Some rules that need to be explained with more than 2 words aren't while stupid stuff has a full explanation. Playing this system has been both a blessing and a curse.

A mini system that can afford you to play any antique, medieval, fantasy miniatures from any manufacturer at any scale (I do mostly 30mm for demo for everybody to see but I started 1/72 because of lower cost) why shouldn't it have the best note ?
Perhaps because it involve a part of personal adaptation.
Well just like Heroquest, the high rating is given for the whole DBx system and the products (most army list) that can be found on Internet. HOTT as stand alone would be only 5, mostly because of lack of background or specific miniature range.

I play this with bare cardboard, wood, and plastic bases, and paper terrain.  Hey, I'm cheap, and it's no less fun...

Update: dropping rating from 8 to 6; this kind of game doesn't get a lot of play at my house.  And if someone wanted to play this style of game, I would probably suggest [gameid=18985].

Versatile, and most importantly, Fun!  For anyone who loves fantasy minis this is a golden purchase. Plus, it's great fun with Lego.  I was able to make two complete armies by hacking up 3 baseplates.  I haven't ironed out all the rules but when I do my rating could go up.  I found the wadbag document for dba to be a help since I had to learn the rules on my own.

Also have 24AP 15mm High Elf Army.

RATING: 4
OK set of fantasy mass battle wargame rules written in a strange language known as 'Barkerese'. The rules are completely unambiguous once you know what they mean, until then you have problems...
Generic and formulaic to the point of abstraction these rules nevertheless allow armies formed from just about ANY miniatures to fight any other so long as the basing is compatible.

HoTT is simply the best Mass Battle Fantasy Rules around.
The real gem in it is that you can convert/adapt any Fantasy
World to it.

Although you can play from 28/30mm-6mm Scales visually it works
better at 10mm or 6mm(my favorite)

Hordes of the Things is a miniatures game (not a boardgame).  I rate Hordes highly due to the versatility of the system, the short playing time, and the fact you don't need too many miniatures.  You can re-create virtually any army or theme from any book or movie using the design rules.  Certainly brings out the creativity in players who are able make all sorts of weird and wacky fantasy army lists.  The rules were designed by the designers of DBM and DBA which are two quality Ancient/Medieval miniatures rules.  I'm currently working on Lord of the Rings and Monty Python and the Holy Grail armies.

Old system of rules on a IGOUOGO format. Coming up for 20 years old soon.Still works ok in DBA for Ancient skirmishing but for Fantasy it just doesn't get the 'Fantasy' feel across at all.It felt like I was replacing Ancient historical units with fantasy units and playing the same game.

RATING: 8
Simple rules, but have a few quirks. Writing is very technical and clear, but possibly hard to understand sometimes. Rules are very balanced but a tad too dry for me. Furious fun with the right people, can bog down into millimeter management with the wrong sort of people. Should play very fast (45 minutes max., often over in 20 min. or so) with the right people.

TRADE: I have a number of painted and based armies in 28mm for this game that I would sell.

OWNED, but I do not list books here anymore as it distorts the figures for board games owned.

I don't like fantasy games, but this is an exception.  Based on DBA, my favorite game, it had a lot going for it already.  However, the fact that you can create your army from virtually any inspiration you find is its real strength.

Fantasy DBA. The fantasy theme and better rules writing makes it better than DBA in my opinion. Good for quick games and a super-simple points system makes it extremely accessible to everyone, but not nearly enough "fantasy chrome" to really pique my interest in playing this over many other fantasy miniature war games.

a nice, easy to play miniatures game.  after reading the comments that the rules were hard to understand I was hesitant to get this game but I'm glad I did.  I think those comments are about the first edition because I didn't have any problem reading the rules.  That is not to say the rules are simple.  There are many subtleties that take some discussion to figure out, especially where rules seem to contradict eachother.

A fun simple wargame.  My main dislike is that the winner is the one who brings to bear as many forces as quickly as possible.  Holding back a reserve is a recipe for defeat.

Probably the miniatures game I've played the most. As games last less than a hour, you can get through a few games in an evening.

Obstensibly set in a traditional quasi-medieval fantasy world, once you understand the relationships between troop types, you can can almost use any figure from any genre with these rules, from laser toting aliens, to modern warfare, etc. You can then start using all those figures that you may have had lying around gathering dust for years!

Great game, very simple, very fast. 
No big game companies to worry about, you are absolutely free to use whatever miniatures you want in any scale you want, you are not limited.
You can design an army in any way you want as the armies are fully customizable (armies based on point systems).
Rule book is cheap, the miniatures are cheap depending on where you get them.
Overall one of the best games I've played.

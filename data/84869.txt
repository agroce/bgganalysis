I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. It's kind of an old-school German game. It has some tension in grabbing the right kind of merchandise before your opponents. It has set collecting, in the scoring of trade tokens. Multiple ways to score, with the tokens, mysterious places, bonuses, and merchant placement. The only concern is that speculating on what future boats need, and then getting it wrong, can set you back. But, not horribly. I thought it held together well, and I _definitely_ felt like I was a cat merchant. :)

Kicsomagolás és alkatrészek:
A doboz elsőosztályú minőségű, a jobbik fajtából, melynek nem annyira sérülékeny a felülete. A grafika szép, de nem az én világom.
A doboz nem annyira súlyos, de kinyitás után úgy látom itt is mindent patent tettek a dobozba. Semmi nem lötyög.
A dobozból a következők kerültek elő. Szabálykönyv, kinyomó kartonok (4 ív), Játékos tábla (A2-es), majd a tároló rekeszekben egy csomag kártya, faalkatrészek és egy szövet zsák. Plusz nejlon tasak nincs benne.
Ez a szövet zsák visz mindent a dobozban, mert a Matagot logó rá van varrva :) Egyből ki is venném és az összes Matagot játékhoz ezt használnám :)
A tároló rekesszel nincs sok bajom azon kívül, hogy csúnya a grafikája, de a játék stílusához abszolút passzol.
A fa komponensek (meeple) köszött a figurák egyediek és nagyon tetszik. Azt azért nem értem, hogy miközben az összes komponens egy tasakban van, miért van négy különböző színű figura egy pici tasakban. Tartalék vagy karatén :D
A kártyák jó minőségűek, matt sima felülettel rendelkeznek. Tartóssága számomra meghatározhatatlan.
A kinyomó kartonokból nagyon könnyen kijöttek az elemek és nagyon jó minőségűek, talán csak a hajók nem, mert annak egész fura csúcsos alakja van. Ne is lehetett volna jól megoldani. A hajók összeállításához nem kellett túl nagy okosság, elsőosztályú minőség mind tervezés és kivitelezés alapján. Csak az én bénázásom miatt szakadt el az egyik. Javaslom másnak, mielőtt összehajtja, a hajtási pontokat egyenként törje be, mert különben alászakad a felület. A kartonból előkerült elemeknek viszont nagyon tetszik a grafikai kivitelezése.
A tábla A2-es méretű két oldalú és két különböző térképpel.
Visszapakoláshoz kel jó pár nejlon tasak és a kinyomó kereteket is érdemes visszatenni a dobozba, így nem lötyög benne semmi.

An okay set collection & bidding game with several layers of set collection (collect goods chits to place a meeple on a boat, collect a scoring chit and/or collect gold/spice/food/cards when the boat sails and the meeple lands on the new continent, place your meeples in groups and collect sets of cards and scoring chits to increase their value).  The game is as much about denying opponents what they need/want to make their sets as it is about you making sets yourself... but sometimes you just cannot block an opponent.  The advanced game bonus chit that changes the scoring to 2-points per food (instead of zero) might be over-powered (i.e. broken).  Just an okay or good game, not great.

Component warning:  the wooden meeples and discs were moldy in our new copy of the game.

This game is massively over complicated and really difficult to figure out the game play for a strategic win. It also has absolutely nothing to do with cats and my feeling is that they were stuck on the game to sell it because the game play really didn't for me.

RATING: 6
It's actually a pretty decent game, if not great with two players. The cat theme is just silly, since the game is so themeless anyway, and you're not even trading cat-related products (why do cats need glass and clocks?). 

The income/bidding phase is a little wonky, as it usually seems best to wait until you make $3 on your personal board, unless you're desperate to get in on an action first.  The game does have a stalling problem, especially in the 2-p. game, where no resources come out that are needed to satisfy any of the boats. So players stall, trading if necessary, to keep the game going. I had fun on my two plays, but feel fine letting this one go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Ignore the cats; they appear to have been spray painted on at a late stage as this has nothing to do with cats.  Quite a lot going on here, with nice tension and choices to make to load boats with the goods they need and get them to where you want at the right time.  It plays smoothly and keeps you engaged without dragging - all in all a rather good game, though nothing whatsoever to do with cats! While the cover art isn't to my taste I think the internal art on the board etc is really rather good. Even Tom Vassel, who wasn't otherwise complimentary, agrees with that. And the wee boats are fantastic. All in all, it's a very attractive package - once you're past the cover. 

My theory is that this was originally themed as a game about trading with Atlantis - a mysterious island is here and the cards and resources you can obtain would match. If I've followed the story correctly, the game's publication was delayed by a year after it was picked up by Asmodee.  Why would that delay the publication? Perhaps if it would cause a clash with something else they were publishing?  Well, Asmodee published Atlantis the year before Felinia and perhaps had to decide which one to go with first - perhaps leaving them with a finished game they had to re-theme in a hurry ... "I know - cats - everybody likes cats - just paint some cat heads onto those merchants on the cover and we're sorted" - at least that's how it looks - there's little sign of cats once you're past the box cover.

I wonder if this was a standard Euro that was half-way rethemed with cats, or a cat-themed Euro that was half-way rethemed to humans.  In any case, it's a Euro that features cats as humans, sailing about, delivering goods, looking to develop colonies upon landing.  I wish they'd taken the cat theme the whole way - perhaps having Puss-in-Boots type characters delivering goods, and having the goods be cat-oriented, like catnip or mice.

One half of an extremely annoying game for me (to the point where I gave up). The auction mechanism can create nastly lockout situations. It is too chaotic, and too restricted: limited stockpiling and limited financial resources mean that players are forced to commit themselves without really knowing if their investments will pay off. In my case I was really struggling very hard to get a first and a second meeple on a boat where others were already on their fifth or sixth. I don't mind losing because I myself played badly; I do mind losing because of this sort of stupid nonsense. 

Now what happened to me was probably exceptional with player chaos and turn order changes hitting me at precisely the worst possible moment [i]every time[/i]. If I was on the verge of the right resources some other player grabbed the boat before me. Was I the only one collecting resources for a boat, it would sail off empty because it had the lowest timestamp. Was I in possession of the right resources and an empty spot, I didn't have the cash to bid competitively to secure the last resource. Did I have everything in order, the boat would fill up, and I would be stranded with resources I could not use anywhere—save as a means to get some money back and starting over again. Players are asked to play this game very tactically. You can't plan worth a dime, and that is in stark contrast with some of the points handed out at the end.

Even with a less brutal turn of bad luck I fear I'm not going to play this game again.

This game is not friendly to color-blind people. They use symbology through-out, but mistakenly leave the symbols off of the most important tiles in the game. The ship tiles which you need to purchase a spot on have tiny little icons of different colors, corresponding to the different material tokens. However, the colors are horrible and impossible to tell apart when color-blind, and without symbols, makes the game almost impossible to play.

I used to have this rated a lot lower, but actually it's okay to break out every once in a while. It's nothing groundbreaking but it's fun to sometimes play a mindless euro, and the pricing mechanic is really interesting (you place markers at different markets and if you get there later, you pay more but you get first choice), I'd love to see someone pick that up for another game.

Also, very nice components, but the colours are nearly impossible to tell apart sometimes.

A licit rendszer valóban mint a Speicherstadté..amit egymástól függetlenül találtak ki.
De aztán sokkal másabb: több lehetőség, több variácó, más a játék.Egy hátrány: csak 4 személyes a speicherstadt 5 főjével szemben.
Amúgy a játék gyönyörű, kicsit a hajók -fedélzet színe- nem egyértelmű, volt hogy melyik hely melyik hajóhoz: barna-világos kavarás lehet. De ez valszeg 1 játék után már nem jön elő.
Ugyanakkor sok lehetőség, sok mód, varia lehetőség, jobb mint a másik, szerettem. majdnem 9-es...

Nice trading and shipping worker placement game.  Really nice components - beautiful map.  Would be rated higher if the theme was more than a picture on the box.   Should have been shipping catnip and tuna instead of spices and jewels.  Also, cats hate water - so I'm not sure cats on a boat is a good idea - maybe leading a caravan in Egypt across the desert would have been better?  It's like crossing one giant kitty litter box.

Punch and assemble the ships before play.

Played a 2p game on the easy rules. Lost 52-70 points, he got all his meeples down but also focused on two tiles sets, but I got more variety (hence fewer points). It seemed OK but money and so choice was very tight. will play again and suggest gamers just jump straight to the advanced version. 2 hours on a family level game seemed over long.

Schönheit, über die keiner spricht. FELINIA ist ein unentdecktes buntes Kleinkunstwerk. Aus einem Dreiseiter an Regelwerk entschlüpft ein charmantes Spiel, in dem der Blick auf die Dinge, die man alle im Auge behalten muss, sich strahlenförmig ausdehnt. Eine kompetitive Symbiose aus Biet-, Setz- und Sammelspiel, die wohl der visuellen Farbexplosion zum Opfer fiel, über der sich der nüchtern in die Welt blickende, sachliche Geist aufregt. Oder war es die miese PR von Matagot? Vertriebsprobleme? Spielekarma? Das zwangsfantasiekrampfhafte, hanebüchene Katzenthema? Es bleibt ein kleines Rätsel, warum FELINIA so wenig bunte Freunde gefunden hat.

An elegant game with an interesting acquisition system: players place their discs on various markets, and the owner of the disc on the top of the stack chooses his merchandise first but pays more. The players need the right goods to embark on boats that ship to different lands, where they position their merchants and take various tokens. There are basic and advanced rules, using different sides of the board, but I guess most people will have no problem in going straight to the advanced game.

The colorful artwork and cardboard boats are pretty, but I miss the great plastic miniatures from previous Matagot's big box releases (well, the box is actually smaller this time, which is a good change). The cat people were what first caught my attention, and having wooden pieces for them is a bit of a let-down. Also, on the theme, I think the designer might have given them something more exciting to do than commerce - which is the same gripe I have with "The Golden City". But it's still a very good game.

Tactical set collection game with an odd cat theme that's a bit too long for what is on offer and suffers from terrible color choices. The mechanisms are solid but nothing original. The auction mechanism is a basic form of the one used in Speicherstadt. Contrary to this game, in Felinia it's just one of the game elements. I like it but it will be hard to get on the table with discerning BGG gamers. Should be played with the advanced rules from the beginning, if only for the 'super ham' tile.

Only one 4-player game so far, but it was fun and not difficult to learn.

Keen to play again.

I would probably rate this a 4, but I have to give it a bonus point for having the most ridiculous theme I've ever seen. It is also a serious contender for ugliest box cover of all time. I'm not sure why they thought this was a good idea.

This is definitely a pure Schacht design, very clean and abstract mechanics, completely pasted on theme. But the big problem here is that the game is too long. I enjoy my Schacht as long as it's short - Hansa, China, Patrician - they all are almost complete abstract games, but they are 30 - 45 minutes. This would be much better if it played in that amount of time. But here the time commitment is too much for what is very little reward.

[Essen 10 purchase] Despite the pretty cat art and the cool ships, this is one of the driest and most monotonously-mechanical games I've played in a while (and I've played my share of Euros). I'm really ashamed that the pretty art fooled me.

The exchanging of tiles was extremely fiddly (was this playtested at all?) as was the constant reloading of the market. The trade-ins made it too easy to get what you wanted. Overall, very disappointed.

Felinia isn't all that original, but it uses familiar mechanisms to create a tight little game that offers plenty of turn angst and tough decisions. Could use some improvements (for example Felinia's bidding mechanism isn't as interesting as a similar mechanism in Speicherstadt), but still a solid game.

I'm surprised by how the game looks. Other Matagot games I've played look absolutely gorgeous, and while Felinia has the same high quality components, the board looks unfinished and colors are dark and muddy (maybe a printing error?).

While I admire how designer Michael Schacht manages to construct intriguing card games from a single idea, I enjoy playing his bigger games a lot more. The spark of originality, more often than not a new way to auction off something, is not as clearly visible, but it’s usually imbedded in an intricate web of other stuff to keep in mind.

All this holds true for Felinia, an area-controllish affair that is cunningly disguised as a trading game. The wares that are auctioned off are actually just part of a ship tickets that allow your explorers to be placed on valuable spaces. Once you get your head around this (and carry the game board under the brightest lamp in your home to compensate for the horribly indistinct colours), the game has an excellent flow, nice tension and lots of strategic options. Quite lovable, and the whimsical theme at least prevents it from being another game set in renaissance Italy.

I really liked the mechanic of the order of placing your discs, where the last to place gets to pick first, but pays the same number as the total number of people who placed there... (makes sense if you play it.)  Beyond that it kind of just felt muddled together and nothing was really that great about it to me.  Colors are awful.  Kept getting mixed up with which shade of brown goes to which brown island, and which shade of dark grey am I getting?  And finally... cats?  really? um, ok.

Color me "Schacht" by the relatively heavy weight of Felinia, given the designer's repertoire (Mondo, China, Zooloretto). And how rare is the max-4-player auction game? [ed: answer: semi] I wonder about the dialogue that led to its conception... "not another game about trading in the Mediterranean?" "hmm... well, why don't we make the traders [i]cats[/i]?!" 

It was great fun on a first play, but I do have some doubts about replayability.

The art and components are not bad, but they made a terrible mistake when choosing the colours of the areas: they are easily confused. The theme fails completely.

It's a tactic worker placement abstract game with very few options and an important random component (boats draw and opponent's actions). Once you choose your path, it's pretty evident what you must do in order to maximize points and it's just a matter of having the spots available at your turn.

The only exciting and tense element is the auction part. There are also some rewards much better than others (the ones that provide goods).

OK game: nothing new under the sun.
However this game has a serious issue: the colour choices for the resources/villages are just too bad and difficult to differenciate from each other (is it yellow? or brown? or dark brown? or grey? or black???...)

I think Felinia has a lot of potential. The ghastly presentation can be easily put aside to reveal a neat encapsulation of all of Schacht's best mechanics: a simple and lively market, penetrating area control, and a requirement to be virtually prescient when it comes to timing. This is by far the best of the Gold trilogy, and the only one that has viable 2P potential.

Fun little game. Easy to pick up, but plenty of things to think about in play. But, the colours are terrible and hard to distinguish (impossible if you're at all colour blind I'd think). The 'cat' theme is ... less of a theme and more of an afterthought. 

Still, worth the effort of picking it up if you can deal with the colour issue.

We liked the game and it seems like it could do better if it was put out with a bit more polish and gave into the cat theme a bit more.  Why can't you be trading fish, catnip and balls of yarn?

Component quality was a bit lacking.. My board looked worn and many of the meeples were deformed/broken.

The first play felt a little slow.  Each round is filled with a large number of microdecisions (where should I place my bid tiles (3x), do I want to spend the money to take what's left where my bid tile is (3x), and if so which tile do I take (3x), which ship do I want to place my passenger on (0-2x), which path do you want to take (0-2x), which token do you want to collect(0-2x).  In other words, over the course of the game, some 400 decisions are made.  It's very easy to fall into the trap of thinking for 20 or so seconds each time the turn comes to you and you need to make a decision.  In isolation, 20 seconds for each decision doesn't seem unreasonable, but then the game is a 2-hour game.

I'd like to try the game again with people who already know the game, and who are willing to make a conscious effort to form a plan well in advance and push to make decisions in 10 seconds or less.  I think it could be a lot of fun if the total playing time were an hour or less.

RATING: 6
After the first play of the advanced game, I was not particularly impressed and questioned the strength of acquiring the 2 food tile (mainly as that was the key factor in my wife's victory).

However, the second play not only finished within 60 minutes but showed that the game has difficult choices (especially after two glasses of wine) and requires short focus on what the other player is trying to do.  The boat tiles are going to disappear quickly.  Therefore it is a case of trying to get on the early boat and adapt your strategy accordingly.  A tactical game more than a strategic one.

Lovely components too and I don't personally have any issues with the colour scheme.

Played once with 3P. Felinia features a rather excellent auction format, which is a gentler variant of [thing=66505][/thing]'s auctions. There is an insidious tradeoff involved as the auction progresses – the tokens placed later are more valuable as they secure goods that you need (albeit at a higher price), but they are also most efficient at generating money. However, if you constantly use your third token for money, then you may be letting your opponents get away with desired goods for cheap.

It's a pity the rest of the game doesn't match the ingenuity of the auctions. Set collection drives the VP generation, but the different sets have eerily similar scoring systems. I should also note that the game is repetitive; players gain money, buy items and ship items [i]ad nauseam[/i] until the game is over, with little buildup or sense of progress throughout. This would not be a drawback if Felinia were a quick game, but in reality it lasts over 75 minutes and the game wears out its welcome halfway through.

The production values are mostly great, and you can tell a lot of care went into the 3D boats and the embroidered bag. It does, however, suffer from poor colour choices, with colours being too similar in some parts and too lurid in others. Overall, a great auction system, but also one that deserves a better (and maybe quicker) game built around it.

Cheap buy from The Works.... Meeeeoooow!

2015 UPDATE:

Actually, I have a lot of issues with this one. Looking past the wonderful 3D boats, there is a definite colour issue with the tiles. Also, game does really drag, and thus far I cannot wait for it to be over. Not one of Mr. Schacht's best.

RATING: 6.5
It has shockingly bad theme and artwork! Cat-people? Really? Why couldn't this have been trading in Europe? If you can get past that, though, it's not so bad. The basic version is more random, so we played the advanced version. 

Players each have 3 bid tokens (cylinders), and a personal board that tracks their cash (0-6; start with 3?) and that has spaces to earn 1, 2, or 3 coins. The board has areas to explore on the left -- several differently colored regions, each divided into spaces, most of which have a face down chit placed in them at the beginning of them, some have icons for stuff you get when entering the space with your merchant meeple, and some are blank. The right side of the board has 5 (?) auction areas (markets) where 3 tiles (2 in first round) are auctioned off each round, and a 6th area that offers players the ability to trade a goods tile for one of another type. Each turn, also place 4 boats on the board between these areas; each boat shows a different color (matching the areas on the left), a different combination of goods tiles in demand, and space for 1 or 2 merchanteeples.

Starting with start player then going clockwise 3 times, players place their cylinder in one of the 6 areas OR the appropriate income space on their personal board. If other cylinder(s) are already present, stack yours on top. Then, resolve each area in order (top to bottom): each cylinder in stack, from top to bottom, may buy one of the items available for sale (or for that 6th space, make a trade); the price is the total number of cylinders in the stack (either buy, or remove your cylinder). If you conducted any business and you now have a set of goods demanded by a boat, and that boat has an empty space, place your merchanteeple there (and return goods chits to the bag). 

After all areas resolved, boats with all merchant spots full sail to their area (top to bottom of column of boats). In each area, if 2 merchants landing, resolve the one placed on the boat first, first. Merchants may move 3 spaces for free, then 1 additional space per food spent. Get any items marked in spaces they enter. If enter space with token, collect the token (which have pictured one of the types of cats in the game, or one of several special action tiles -- e.g., earn extra coin whenever you earn coin on the board, earn extra food, extra VP at end, etc.). Movement ends immediately, and that merchant stays there till end of game. (If mvmt ends before reaching token, merchant returns to your supply.)

Game ends when you cannot refill the 4 boats at the start of a round. Then, score more VP for groups of adjacent merchant meeples (bigger groups score more). Also score for sets of similar types of cats -- larger sets score more. Most VP wins.

This is actually a pretty nice little set collection game with the familiar Schachtian limits on income and storage between turns. There's not a lot new here, but it all makes a pretty solid game. The bidding mechanism is similar to [thing=66505][/thing] (but apparently developed well before that game was released ... a misfortune of timing!) and works well here, too. I wouldn't mind playing it, even possibly owning it. But I really don't like the artwork, and it's not all _that_ exciting a game ... a solid 7 but there are too many of those these days!

About a quarter way through your first play you'll realize how nasty this game can get when someone overbids you on getting the resources you wanted and then snipes the boat you were going to take. Strange sort-of-bidding, lots of goods to juggle, some positional and set collecting elements - lots to like!
Cat theme is very pasted on though - the goods aren't even cat themed. :(

This is a cool game, and a good introduction /gateway to bidding/set collection/area control.  Very light on all three.  However I highly suggest to play with the advanced version no matter what level of gamer you are, it just adds a few extra elements.  

As far as the theme goes,  so they are cat traders in a world where basically the people are cats.  And the different parts of Felinia are different types of cats, lions, tigers, jaguars, and panthers.  I mean I guess they could have done like every other game and made them people....  But use your imagination, I like the theme and the twist on it.

Theme stamped on or not, it is great artwork, and great production.

  Are there better games out there... Of course, but this one is still fun!

very visually appealing game, with a sort of backwards "Die Speicherstadt" auction.  The auction is a little different from many though, because it's VERY difficult to make even a little bit of profit from it (It would be VERY hard to earn 1 boat's worth of advantage from any reasonably attentive group),  so it's more about gauging what you're getting and when (for purposes of set collection/lines of workers) rather than trying to eke out a gain.

What's the deal with the theme?  I like cats, but the game has nothing to do with them.  This is just another new world exploration game, but inexplicably the art and protagonists are cats.  It's a very thin theme, and I suppose it's nice that it's not yet another game that's indistinguishable from the rest, but it is a very odd choice.  It's a shame, because there's room to run with the theme, but they instead opted to use the cats too little.  If you're going to make a crazy artistic choice like that, may as well stick to your guns and go all out.

The components are good.  The ships in particular are really cool, and the art is well-done.  It does look vivid and different from other games like it.

The game itself is solid.  It's familiar territory from a mechanics perspective, but it seems well-balanced and has a lot of decisions.  I've only played the basic game, but the market mechanic presents surprisingly rich choices from some very simplistic rules.  The placement on the island is also pretty interesting.  I don't know that it'd be endlessly replayable, but the advanced game looks like it adds a bit more strategy and replayability, and makes the game a little heavier.  All in all, this is a pleasant surprise.

An excellent game, vastly underrated on BGG IMO. It's essentially a Renaissance-y trading game, with cat people on the artwork that are kind of cool, but essentially irrelevant to the game. There's a nice bidding mechanism similar to The Speicherstadt, and beautiful components including little 3D cardboard ships!

Unfortunately the colours, though pretty, are poorly chosen and the board doesn't match the cardboard pieces very well. With 2 players the game drags a bit, but I'm considering a house rule of removing one ship of each colour in 2-player games to solve that.

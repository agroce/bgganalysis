A Fits spin off, but with out the fluidity of the original.  Two coloured dominos are drawn and pre-determined shapes need to be matched, with a new shape being added in each of four rounds.  Happy to play, but don't need to own.

I like Knizia’s FiTS, and I was lucky to buy BiTS last month, when I visited Germany. Nevertheless, I and my friends play BiTS with slightly different rules (normally round after round new orders are added (order from „round 1” remains for all players for all 4 rounds, order from „round 2” - for „round 2” to „round 4” etc.)). 
My friend said once – it could be more interesting when we take order from cards with numbers „1” (on cover)  for each round again and again. Later we expanded this rule for cards with numbers „2” and „3”. It means that we are mixing cards before the next round. 
The last rule that we added – each player plays with his own set of cards for each round (for „round 1” of course it’s only 1 card of order) –everybody has different orders at the same time. 
I think that it makes more fun for us then official BiTS rules.

Game expansions have certainly become commonplace nowadays.  But a sequel is a much rarer thing to find.  Well, when I found out about this sequel to FITS it quickly became a must-buy, since FITS is my most-played game.  The thing is, BITS is a very different game.  What I really like about it is that it makes me think in a very unique way.  I'm always thinking about 2 or 3 different shapes I want to make or avoid with every single tile that is flipped.  I'm a big puzzle fan so the puzzly nature of this game is ideal for me.

What makes it a little less desirable to my wife and family is that, unlike FITS, it seems that BITS is more tactical rather than strategic.  The reason is that you can't pass on a piece or play above the grid.  Therefore every tile must be played and you just have to make due with what you're given.  In FITS you can hold off and really wait at times for that ideal piece, but not here.  Overall, I really like this game as a unique alternative to FITS, but it will probably never reach my most-played games or my Top 10.

I think I might like this better than FITS. I like that the plusses and minuses for each round just get added to for subsequent rounds, so it feels like the rounds are linked, rather than being totally separate each time.

Let me tell you a story.

First there was a video game named Tetris that was beloved by all. There have been some attempts to make a board game version but they all came up short.

Then, yea, Ravensburger and Reiner Knizia released FITS, and was well-liked by most! It, more than any other board game, captured the feel of Tetris. Many fans of Tetris loved FITS.

Then FITS begat BITS, a similar game to its predecessor, but with far more variability and its own unique feel. And, while this is subjective, I am of the strong opinion that BITS is actually a much better game than FITS.

Alas, that unique feel of BITS it turned out had little in common with Tetris. Many of the fans of FITS tried BITS, and could not abide its lack of Tetris-ness. Therefore, BITS is considered A Worse Game. Because, for some reason BITS, a great game in its own right, is unfairly compared to Tetris because it is in the same family as, basically, Tetris: The Board Game.

A pity. If BITS had been released in a world without FITS, I think it would be held in much higher regard. However, a lot of FITS fans looked at this and said, "Eh, not enough like Tetris" and said No.

And lo, BITS was forgotten.

RATING: 9
Randomly drawn dominoes are placed in a grid in order to complete tasks such as particular tetromino shapes to score points and avoid penalties. Spiritual successor to FITS.

This is a multiplayer solitaire game. Nothing you do will impact anyone else. That said, it is a fun challenge, something you can play by yourself and it is a quiet, contemplative diversion. I recommend playing with a 24-second shot clock to chivvy along pokey players.

RATING: 7
First game review:     This is a tile-drawing/placement game in the spirit of Take it Easy where all players draw the same tiles.  This means that games are certainly very fair and even.

I quite like this one, probably more than FITS (which seems to be a Tetris plagiarism to me).   At least this game offers some sort of original thought in its design, and I suppose the various different scoring types add some variety to games.    While Karen immediately said she wanted to get this game, I'm still on the fence...  I would certainly get this over FITS or request it in a math trade, but its rated 7 for now.

RATING: 7
A fun little tile placement game where players are trying to place tiles on their grid, attempting to best conform their placements to a series of point cards which will reward players for creating certain configurations.

In the first round, a scoring card is flipped, giving players a goal to shoot for (making groups of 4, or something similar).  Then, bingo-style, a tile is chosen at random that everyone must place.  Once each player has filled his grid, they score points.

Then, in round 2, another goal is added to the first.  So, in addition to making groups of four, you might also score for making a group of 2 of a color.  In the third round, another goal is added, and yet another in the 4th round.  High score after 4 rounds wins!  

Overall, just a fun and light game that pretty much anyone could play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
How many spatial push your luck games do you know? The tension point in this is when to abandon potential scoring shapes and when to hope that the right shapes will come soon, even though your board is getting more and more cluttered as time goes on.

Game must be played with the "advanced" rules. Scare quotes in place to make clear that the advanced rules are not more advanced than the basic rules, they simply make the game one round longer (and far better).

Taken from the same mold as FITS, I like this just a bit better.  Here you are dropping pieces into a grid, but each is only 2 squares long.  Also, the goals (which include the bonuses and penalties) stack up over the course of the game.  It almost allows players to become experienced at creating a particular shape.

Lots of painful choices makes for good fun.  The only downside is that like FITS, this is simply multi-player solitaire.  No player interaction, and it would be hard to even spot someone else's board.  Still - it's good clean fun.

Bits is another mulitplayer solitaire puzzle game in the vein of Fits. Instead of Tetris tiles, this time Knizia used colored dominoes with which you try to form certain colored shapes. The shapes the players aim for or try to avoid are determined by drawing one scoring card per round which gets added to the scoring cards of the previous rounds. So you have a nice sense of escalation as more and more shapes to shoot for or avoid are added to the mix. Because of this, the three (or four) rounds the game lasts feel more connected than they do in Fits.

While I like Bits' scoring mechanism more than the one used in Fits, I do still prefer Fits at the moment. Somehow, Bits feels more forgiving than Fits with a little more room for errors. Because of this, a win in Fits is a bit more satisfying.

Nevertheless, I'm always up for a game of Bits but given the choice, I would prefer Fits. 

By the way: I do miss grid overlay that was used in Fits.

This is a very simple variation on Fits, and quite enjoyable.  I think I like it more than Fits, but I have only played it once.  It has a nice balance of luck and strategy, and the changing goals make the 4 rounds different enough to be interesting.

Players place 1 x 2 tiles onto a small gridded playing board, Tetris style, trying to earn points and avoid penalties.  Fun, fast playing little puzzler, that looks rather similar to BITS, but seems to play cleaner.  BITS is less mathy and more of a puzzler.  There is also nice sense of escalation, as a new scoring card is revealed in each of the three rounds, and stacks onto the previously revealed cards.  Excellent game - always ready to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Knizia's take on Dr. Mario.   I like that the goal cards continue to stack on top of each other, making each round a little harder and a little more vital than the previous.   Having the risk of negative point formations is an important element of the design.   FITS is probably better, but this could make a nice alternative from time to time.

[1 play] Very very derivative of FITS, but also good.  Of course I like FITS.  I think BITS probably allows for more high-risk play, leaving a space and waiting to get a particular piece.  And it has duplicate pieces, which makes that sort of play more practical than in FITS.

Just like its older brother FITS, BITS is a multiplayer solitaire puzzle game, and while it does play somewhat differently due to the fact that you are not trying to fit your blocks on the playing area tetris-style but instead trying to create certain shapes of colours from dominoes it doesn't really change the feel of the game all that much. If you like one, it's a fairly safe bet you'll also like the other.

The color matching of BITS is far less interesting than the geometric positioning of FITS. All the pieces are the same boring rectangles, and there's just no spark to the game.

BITS really only starts getting interesting in the third round when the penalties are introduced. Even then, I'd rather be playing FITS.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Bits is a fine and challenging game filled with decisions each and every turn that have a direct impact on your performance.  No, these decisions are generally not taxing, but they are still vitally important.  Where do you place a tile and how do you orient it?  Is it worth scrapping the tile and using your one-and-only neutral tile?  When do you abandon hope of finishing a pattern with a particular color and move forward on another set?  The game builds a tension similar to that found in Peter Burley’s Take it Easy, where you are hoping for a needed tile to be the next one revealed.  This makes for a fun and challenging game, even though it is somewhat luck-driven.

It is difficult to assess Bits on its own without comparing it to its predecessor.  Both games play very similarly.  Indeed, Bits feels like a variant of Fits.  Yes, the objectives are different, but the feel is the same.  I actually enjoy both games, but find the decisions to be made in Fits more challenging.  With the variety of oddly shaped tiles, there seem to be more choices in orienting and placing the tiles.  My fondness for Tetris may be influencing my opinion, but I feel Fits is the more challenging game.  Bits is easier and less taxing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It actually plays different enough to justify it on it's own.  Some of my friends that are FITS fans have begun to say they enjoy this more.

I think that BITS ay be more 'accessible' in that it seems 'easier' not to feel like you are going backwards.

I think I like FITS better, because I feel it's easier to get 'screwed' in FITS.  And so I feel more of an accomplishment in when I do well.

Another brain-trauma-inducing nightmare of a game from the sadistic mind of Knizia. I thought FITS was brutal, and now this. Seems simple and innocent, yet an angst-ridden exercise of balancing probability and pattern feasibility. At the end of my second game, I was screaming at the top of my lungs: "KNIZIAAAAAAAAA!!!!!"

Light and short enough for a good filler, like FITS, yet different. I guess you'll have to try it and see, as it is another acquired taste.

There are enough changes to make this a different game from the original FITS. Now all the pieces are rectangles of two colored squares. There are four rounds each with a different rule card for scoring, but the rules accumulate so that the rounds become progressively more difficult. Rounds 1, 2, and 4 give positive scores, while round 3 gives a negative score. It is a challenging but fun puzzle game.

I haven't played its predecessor FITS which is generally considered to be a bit better and is far more widely available. But BITS gave me that Tetris puzzle fix I expected and I'm happy with playing this occasionally. As known from comparable multiplayer solitaire puzzles where all players have to use the same tile on individual boards (e.g. Take It Easy, Finito), players at some time will be forced to forsake scoring opportunities which will give some a hard time. Recommended if you can cope with that, are nostalgic about Tetris and don't mind zero interaction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only played one time (although with the full 4 rounds). Definitely a nice implementation of a turn-based Dr. Mario style game. I think I slightly prefer Blokus (which is a very different game but scratches the same itch). I think the lack of interaction is a negative, and luck is a big factor among players with similar skill levels. 

Think about this game as one of bad-luck mitigation. You will spend a lot of time trying to minimize the chances of "getting stuck" when the last few pieces arrive. If you don't like games that start with you feeling like you can do anything and then suck away that good feeling little by little - you won't like this one. I do like those games, but something like Kingdomino holds better universal appeal (and has more interaction as well).

I enjoy FITS quite a bit, but rarely feel the urge to play it.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed BITS, which feels very similar, but provides a significant challenge as well.  I'm a sucker for these types of games, though I suspect that in the long run FITS may turn out to be a better game.  This one is a little less frustrating, though in these games I think "frustrating" is a good thing.

I'm not sure this "FITS turned upside down, inside out" version is not better than the original. It really turns the original game on its head - instead of using Tetris tiles for creating rows, you are using row sections (dominoes) for creating Tetris tiles, also instead of taking care not to leave gaps this time gaps don't matter - you are taking care not to make some special forms using your tiles. Surprisingly engaging game with quality and nice tiles, even if it's still a multiplayer solitaire, I really enjoyed this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I have not yet decided which I prefer - FITS or BITS.

LIKE:

* Game plays very similarly to FITS in sliding tiles down but they are all dominoes and you are trying to make certain shape(s) occur using the colors of the tiles.
* You cannot go above the line at the top, unlike FITS, which creates more difficulty at the end.
* I appreciate that you can still score 1 point for a block of 4 colors and that getting the ideal shape grants and additional 2 bonus points.  When you get to task three, the game becomes even more interesting as you have to avoid a certain shape or receive negative points.
* No negative points for spaces unused.
* Plays quickly - Our second game we played in 20 minutes even with an AP prone player.

DISLIKE:

* I miss the plastic grid overlay that exists in FITS.  
* I miss the option that exists in FITS to throw away tiles.  Of course, with no penalty for empty spots in BITS, this could result in a bit of a lesser game if this was allowed...:-)

This game is definitive multi-player solitaire. Each player has a rectangular platter and a collection of rectangular plastic tiles. The tiles show two coloured squares. Each round the players try to lay tiles so that shapes are created by the coloured squares.
Rounds are made up of a series of turns: cards are drawn to select the tile to be played, and each player has to play the same tiles at the same time. Whoever manages to match the target scores points. At the end of each round the platter is cleared, new cards are turned, rinse and repeat. The old targets remain in play, so as the game progresses there are more options to aim for. Over successive rounds the target shapes get more difficult, and there are also shapes that are worth negative points.
So it has a lot in common with Tetris, without the timing aspect.
As a game it is not my thing at all. There is zero interaction within the game, and minimal strategy- "where should I put this so that I might score later?" is not enough for me.

Fast abstract that has a little tetris feel however, it feels even more limiting.  The luck of the starting tile can really help someone if it a scoring color.

Different from some of the other abstract puzzle games as there is no time-limit pressure at all so it does seem to fit in a game collection.

Neat game, with the same feel as FITS but different enough that I could understand wanting to have both.

Here, the pieces are 1x2 rectangles with various color combinations. Like FITS, everyone gets a different starting piece, then plays the rest of their pieces (almost) in random order. Here, though, you only get 1 substitution (double-gray), and may not discard any pieces. There are 4 rounds, with a scoring rule added each round (e.g., score VP for every group of 4, bonus VP for particular shapes, lose VP if you have 3 squares in a row, etc). The rules are _cumulative_. After 4 rounds, the player with the highest sum wins!

I rate Bits as sightly better than Fitz, although it would be improve by some custom base boards similar to Fits.  This game has Much more I'd downstream thinking and you're less at the whim of chance--oh there's still chance, but you can adequately weigh probabilities based on the tiles you have left, to mitigate that chance.  With Fits, you have only about one turn of downstream thinking you can typically figure probability for, which takes most of the control away from the player.

Both Fits and Bits would make great party games if you have more than one set, both are easy to teach and quick to play.  It doesn't really make sense to not just play the 'advanced' game straight out of the box since the fourth round doesn't really add much complexity and the fourth task is always some kind of difficult but exciting shape.

Based on the ability to actually make use of more strategy and probability, Bits scores a half point higher with us.  Each game is definitely unique enough to justify owning both if you have the money and shelf space.

If FITS was a Tetris conversion, BITS takes on Puyo Puyo. Instead of dropping polyominoes, you drop dominoes of 1-2 colours on a grid, then score/lose points for creating specific polyomino shapes. Each round includes the scoring from the previous rounds, then adds a new one, so it gets progressively harder: in order, you get points for a specific tetromino; for a specific triomino of a specific colour; lose points for a different triomino; and, in the optional advanced game, score big points for a specific pentomino.

It's very similar to FITS, so the same criticisms apply (lack of interaction topping the list), but the round system increases the replayability. It's a little less engaging, especially once Ted Alspach's FITS expansions are factored in. Still, a very, very good game.

I like this but then I like these sort of puzzle games. I prefer FITS though. Would play if came out on iOS.

OK game for non-gamers, i hope i will use with my family.
something made me lower the rating: the pieces do no fit horizontally and they sorta "explode" away when i try to push them in. just 2 or 3 mm more would have been enough. and it's ravensburger, not the last of the publisher. how lame!

As the name and logo suggest, playing this feels almost exactly like playing [thing=40393][/thing].  It's a fun, agonizing family game.

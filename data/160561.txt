RATING: 7.5
Positive: nice board, beautiful scenery.
Interesting mechanic: worker movement + place tiles.
Keep attention: Tiles have to match also DIAGONALLY!!
Only in this case the game can have a good end!
Negative: not so much variables and strategies.
Unused decorations give too much victory points. My house rule fix it.

A little lighter than I was hoping it would be. Good worker placement game that is simple to learn. Unfortunately the palace building aspect leaves a little something to be desired - it doesn't help that there are not enough courtyard tiles in the game in case the palace gets built in a U-shape, making it impossible to ever fill in the yard. The game is fun and interesting for a while but becomes mind-numbingly repetitive by the half-way mark and starts to wear out its welcome as you just keep doing the same few things over and over again. Sold in FallCon 30 auction.

Nice gateway game: Simple rules, many short time rewards and an interesting main mechanic.

I would not play Versailles with hardcore gamers as it is quite light but as a consequence the (possibly justified accusations of) imbalances of the game did not bother me.

RATING: 7.6
This is essentially a giant mancala mechanism where you are moving workers along directional paths to activate resources and processes in building the palace of Versailles, which will impress the King and score you a victory. It's a decent introduction to this particular mechanic which works well as a gateway for new players, and I do like having it with this theme. However, do not always expect the tactile satisfaction of completing many of the palace tiles.

I really wanted to like this game, and did for the first hour.  After that it dragged badly.  And we called the end before the real end game because it was going to take a lot longer to fulfil a real endgame criterion.  This game needed more playtesting before being released.

Aware that others have mentioned both these things, but bears repeating now that I sadly know that they were right.

At the beginning I had a good feeling and it played fluent. But after a while I began struggling with the shortcomings of the game. Especially the architect's guild was frustrating. For a long time there wasn't a tile that could be build. The person who wanted to destruct tiles was self to late to get the new tile. And because of that everybody started to buy ornaments they didn't need but that was the most opportune option.

Egy zseniális mechanikával megáldott játék. Én most találkoztam vele először bár nem tudom itt újították vagy csak átvett mechanika. A grafika kicsit elnagyolt de elfogadható. Van benne freskó szerű központi elem építése lapokból, mely a kastélyt személyesíti meg. Szerintem van mélysége és tematikája is, sőt az újrajátszási faktorban is lehet találni bőven lehetőségeket. Ami még nagyon jó benne, hogy pörgős játék. Tényleg nem sok agyalási idő kell hozzá, ami emeli az élvezeti érték.

I do wish the decoration tiles were more interesting than just components, but this game has a novel enough mechanism for "placing" your workers and I don't mind that it's just a race of cube collecting/spending to more VPs. Let's see how this plays out.

Most of the game was fairly standard eurogame fare, which is to say, I enjoyed it, but it slowed down to a crawl towards the end as the construction yard filled up. The rules definitely need to be changed to address this. Shame about it, since worker movement is a pretty novel mechanic.

Versailles has a lot of good & a little bad.
I like the planning of how to get and fulfill contracts.
The resource acquisition is good & the board steps you through everything you need to know.
What I don't like is how long it takes to travel through about 20$ of the board.  To me, it makes the game have too much downtime waiting for the next 3 things you already know you want to do.  
If you spend this time working on maximizing the resource scoring for the end of the game it can help some, however.

Played once, nice game, except: at some point no more tiles could be built to finish the game (other end-game conditions also not in reach), so we decided to stop the game because there was not much to do anymore. Don't like a game to end that way. (rating = 6)

Updated rating (=7). Might be that the first time we did allow placement of tiles in such a way that the board becomes blocked, which cause dead-lock in the end. This time the game ended in a normal way.

Pretty standard Euro, this time with a giant pseudo rondel.  Tension is high when the map starts filling up.  There are a lot of turns where you do nothing other than reposition your meeples, which drags this one down a notch.  Other than that, I thought it was quite fun.

Played this tonight , 5p. There are some things to like but were overshadowed by problems.

Things to like:
- beautiful board and art
- very little downtime between turns
- a somewhat unique system with some difficult/opaque choices

Things not to like:
- the rulebook has some problems. It's not the worst I've seen, but companies really need to start developing better when doing English translations. It's not hard to sit the game down with a few focus groups of English only speakers, hand them the rule book, let them teach themselves and observe them playing to see if there are any issues. There are a few critical rules simply not addressed in the rulebook itself and a few ambiguities. 
- the game, imo, does not scale well. The special powers in particular on the tech track are imbalanced and become substantially more so with higher player counts. At 2 or 3 players I can see the three tracks being somewhat balanced, but at 5 it's not even close. The bottom two tracks get progressively stronger with each player added with no additional cost associated to attempt to maintain balance. At 5 players, I don't think there's really a meaningful choice as to whether or not you go for one of the bottom tracks.
- the game requires you to complete a number of successive micro steps to execute the type of plans you will need to have to win the game. However, there's not a ton of control over preventing other players from undercutting you by beating you to the punch on your same plan. To boot, when they do beat you to it, the penalty is extremely high and very detrimental. I think the extra step of decorations seems to be a large part of this problem as it makes it possible for someone to undercut you after you've already begun to execute a plan, even if at the time you began that plan it was not possible to be undercut given the current state of the board. In a game without astronomical scores, seeing your 16 point plan turn into a 4 point plan can be the difference between winning and finishing last. That's just not fun , especially when it's not because you played poorly.


Overall, it just feels like the game is underdeveloped. im willing to try it at 3 and see if it's imorobed, but never again at 5 and probably not even at 4.

RATING: 7
Very simple rules, however the game is not simplistic. One of the "easy to learn, hard to master". Depending o the strategies used - it can have some moments, where at the end of the game - everyone will race for resources/decorations.
However it is player dependent. Otherwise, the game is a good one. You start with a set of workers on the board (so it's not a worker placement but worker movement game - i guess it's called Mankala system (or it's variation). I had a game of 3 players done in 1:15 -> so it can be considered as a quick one - with a proper set of players.
Definitely solid position from NSKN games.

2015-03-14 : The board is essentially a Mancala board : gather resouces, convert to points, improve your tech. One of those games that's easy to explain because the board is the rules. Play is fast, but it bogged down a bit at the end. Subsequent plays needed to see if that's a one-time hick-up or just a consequence of the design.

Versailles certainly has an interesting and engaging movement and activation mechanic, although somewhat inefficient. Things bog down as the game concludes.  The palace fills up and suddenly, the tiles don't fit and instead everyone finds themselves scrambling around for the small points and it all becomes rather pointless.  The end game almost feels broken and should either end earlier or the Versailles palace tile placement mechanics should be reworked.  A generous 4 stars for me.

Mecánica sencilla...que se repite una y otra vez, de forma pesada e interminable hasta que todo lo que se está haciendo pierde su sentido, y ya sólo vas a rascar puntos y a provocar el final de un juego que no funciona, que no fluye, que te saca de la partida. El diseño gráfico del tablero es malo para su propósito, y lo único positivo es quizá con un arreglo casero el juego podría fluir y entonces ser un familiar apañado.

I enjoyed probably the first two thirds of this. It started slowing down once everybody had "leeching" abilities (you can buy tech that lets you take an action if you're on a particular space when somebody else takes an action there).

Then, right near the end where we realized people had inadvertently screwed each other out of being able to place their tiles, I decided I would be glad to never, ever play this again.

Something like getting half the points for a tile you could prove you could otherwise build (discarding the decorations and resources) might have salvaged the game for me. (Unplaced tiles are worth one point, and unplaced decorations are three each, which honestly seems a bit broken because everybody ended up buying up all the cheap tiles with no intent of ever using them).

Disappointing because it came so close to not being complete, utter crap.

There's a lot to like about Versailles.  It's simple to teach, looks great and plays quickly with little downtime between turns.  I love worker placement games and this is a variation, more a cross between placement and displacement.  I also like tile laying and resource management and this has all of that.

So why a 6.5?  Basically as I feel the end-game doesn't quite work.  
1) It can drag when there is nothing left to do - no tiles can be placed and the King has not yet reached the construction yard.
2) I believe the 3 point decoration score to be too high and turns the game strategy from construction to decoration collection.   

In my latest game I had done the bulk of the work on the Chateau and I had the highest pre-final score. I had also collected the only tile to fit the last space on the construction yard.  I was the only player to not have the Workshop technology and found that all the other players sucked up the decorations quickly on each others turns.  I soon realised they had also taken the decoration I needed for the last tile so I was dead in the water at this point and came last at the final reckoning.
The eventual winner/2nd placed were the players to have done the least in the construction yard but collected the most scoring decorations 7 & 8 (21 & 24 points) respectively.
I know it's a valid strategy, it just doesn't quite sit right with me.

Well, there's quite an interesting thing going on here with Versailles!  Players will control their workers, moving them along a road to different locations in order to activate the effects of those locations.  However, how you can move them, and the additional effects granted by having multiple workers makes Versailles a rather interesting puzzle of efficiency.  And it's a rather simple ruleset that creates a slightly heavier game than one would think from the rules.  However, Versailles has a hard time escaping the somewhat copy-and-paste feeling that the latest Euros have to offer.  Resources-for-stuff-for-VP-points just isn't enough for me anymore.  The track feels somewhat unique but doesn't hide the fact that this is just a resource conversion game with a somewhat wonky spatial building puzzle in the middle.  My rating was slightly downgraded because it was never explained in the rules that tiles placed on the diagonal must also match to ensure that the palace can be fully built.  It's rather uncommon to have to match diagonals in a tile placement game (everyone's reference is Carcassonne, after all), so that was a rather large oversight because when the palace becomes incompleatable, the game slows to an ugly pace that messes with all the other mechanics.

Components: good components overall
Complex: easy to teach, not as easy as it seems to learn (the rules yes, the game not)
Weight: light- family
Players: 3-4
Length: less than 90 mins
Opinion: with a couple of rules and, apparently, not so many decisions on your turn you have a nice game (not only the gameplay but the look of the board). Just move a worker from one place to the next one (or one far beyond with the double movement) and activate the place, without the option to activate the same place twice in a row.
As already said, with an apparently lack of decisions and so easy rules you have a really nice game. You have to plan where your workers are (although you benefit from having several on the same place, is not a good idea to move altogether), what do you need (should I go for this resource, or stop first acquiring tiles for the castle).
Quite some nice decisions, and enjoyable gameplay.
A game I would play with non gamers more than once (and sometime with gamers, but not so often)

Good concept, poor execution.  Building the Palace of Versailles seems like such a fun theme for a game... however... if you don't build it in a certain way you start to get gaps on the board where you won't be able to place tiles.  This is awful since building the palace is the main focus of the game.  Once you can no longer put tiles on the board the game drags on for another 20 minutes or so while you're trying to collect decorations for points.  

To me the game had a lot of potential but ultimately fell completely flat, especially at the end.

Always enjoy this game, there's a few different strategies that can work well with this, from building up your technologies to just building the palace as fast as you can.

Nice worker movement mechanic which is slightly different to other games, and means people can't prevent you doing certain actions. Although they can still block your building or buy that last decoration you might need.

Overall I really like this game as it has good mechanics, you can build a good engine, but you're never quite sure if you'll have time before the game ends to fully benefit.

The game is a bit broken by the construction elements being both limited and worth 3 points in the end.

Very clever medium-light game. The movement rules combined with the fact that you can't do the same action twice in a row creates a very interesting rhythm to your turns. It plays fast and ends before it outstays it's welcome. There is some tension in building the palace. It leaves just a bit to be desired in terms of depth, but makes up for it with short snappy play.

Lightish weight euro game that is decent enough - not least because of simple rules and very fast turnaround between turns - you don't get much AP or downtime.

Moving your workers around various places to collect stuff and spend it for garden tiles = points. Nothing new here. Movement is according to a set path in the same direction although shortcuts are possible. Actually a rondel-game in disguise. Play is simple and smooth, but in the end game counting, resources and tiles add-up way too much points. Those are easy to collect points if you are developed well in certain tracks. We had a continuous resource shortage in the game, because some people were piling them as a way to score points. All in all a very average game. It could have been developed more to tackle the rough edges. Premature release?

First things first: This game is NOT broken!  Everything with the tiles works just fine, so long as you do play the rules correctly (aka, match all corners of the tiles when placing).  Do that, and you have a really fun game!  I enjoy the worker-placement-rondel around the board!  Determining which upgrades to take is always tough/fun.  And it's all about managing your resources and timing your builds vs. timing your gathering.  Tile placement, worker placement, rondel, nice art, and a tight efficiency race!  Very good game!

Which means that as you wanna move your meeples in 'crops' between 2 locations to gain as much profit from each location, a lot of the time your moves are predetermined or logic. I would have liked some more freedom, so that some more thinking would be required.

The combos just got out of hand and the end game was frustrating when 90% of the tiles are unplayable

I'd like to try a variant where the tiles just have to match with the four corners, not the edges

nice light game, only trading to make room on shelves for new stuff. would have kept if there was more variability in board setup (alternate tech tree items)

Quite dull game with no particularly interesting features, but no obvious flaws either. Moving the workers to adjacent spaces limits potential for AP, which is nice.

Jan 2015: I saw the possibility of a US import... yeah... except I keep buying other games. I don't want to wear out Althea on purchases.

July 2015: Dante bought this in a big KS set. I'm happy to play - I got to teach it. It was fun but less so than I expected. I'm sure playing their copy will be good enough for now.

Dec 2015: I submitted a Variant to reduce the King's Track's length. I think it plays better - a few agree.

Interesting and beautiful euro.. One I didn't expect too much from cause the ruls seems very reminiscent of Stone age, but it has a lot of interesting twists that make it stand out on its own. Only downside is the fact that you can "block" the game by buying a particular type of decoration until it runs out, after which others will really struggle to buy the tiles needed to finish the castle.

I liked the theme and the artwork, but (weirdly) the game became *less* fun as it went along. Our castle became complex fairly quickly--perhaps because we banished the easiest-to-place tiles too early?--and we eventually got 'stuck' with a bunch of impossible-to-place tiles. After we banished a few impossible tiles and kept receiving more impossible tiles from the architect, the game just devolved into a race for resources and ornaments. In the crowded genre of worker-placement games, I'm not sure this game rises to the top.

Versailles feels like a great game being hampered by one or two missteps. The game runs far too long, there can be frustrating downtime as you shift workers around the entire track towards the one resource you need to complete a purchase, and early upgrade-rushing can put you impossibly far ahead of the pack. A couple house rules makes this game a winner, but out of the box, it's just okay.

Played twice. Both times the first hour was enjoyable and fast moving. Both times the last half-hour saw the game grind to a halt as we struggled to meet end-game conditions. Shame - probably can be fixed quite easily with a house rule of some kind though.

Decent rondel game with resource management and tile placement. I like that you can take actions when other people do once you have the ability to do so, and the board is large and beautiful. Not bad for those new to the hobby, but didn't find this different enough to be something really innovative.

Played this only with two, would be interested to see how it does with three or four. The issue in a two-player is that it seems to devolve in the latter stages to a game of chicken before placing the final tiles to finish the palace.

RATING: 7
I really like the action selection mechanism in this one, as well as the way technology can be utilized to leech actions and resources from other player's actions. It is possible for the end game to devolve in a way that's not very satisfying, if the center board becomes largely unbuildable. 

The rules as written do not reward digging through the tile deck to find tiles that can be built, because your opponents are more likely to get them than you are. The alos reward hoarding limited items that are necessary for building certain tiles meaning it may become impossible for the majority of players to build anything at all.

If the game gets to the point where it's not progressing and everyone is just waiting for the king to finally arrive, it's a bit of a bummer.

tl;dr: perfectly fine family strategy game

This game combines the familiar elements of worker placement, resource gathering and turning of resources into VPs in a very familiar feeling family friendly strategy game. A bit like [thing=24480][/thing] but maybe even a bit more streamlined (it's been too long since I played Pillars to say).
The big twist is that you don't really place the workers, but you move them from their last action to an adjacent one, so planning the order of your actions is what the game comes down to. And that's a fun puzzle. What adds to that is that most locations get better if you have multiple workers there.
But in the end this twist doesn't make the game stand out as much as I expected. In the end it's just a fine light strategy game that I don't mind playing.

Initial rating: 6.5/10

Looks like a "Pillars of the Earth"-clone at first glance, but differs in so far, that workers have to "travel" around the board and that the building of the palace is more than just a turn counter (like it is in Pillars). But we were not too happy, how the placing of the palace-tiles turned out (easy to block people from placing tiles, cleaning the market for new tiles can lead to a kingmaker problem) and overall the game wasn't really exciting. There are better worker placement games out there.

Versailles is a great idea that doesn't enthrall.  The entire board is one beautifully-disguised rondel and for once, meeples look appropriate.  Much has been made of a few rough edges in the rules but they're easily fixed.  The issue is that Versailles has all of the overhead of a medium-weight strategic game, and it's really just a repetitive efficiency exercise.  To get anything done requires the same 2-4 actions, over and over again.  The hook for the game--building the palace--generates no excitement.

Interesting mechanics but not so great visual design.  The board was too big.  The paths were to difficult to see, and the edges of the construction area were not clear enough with their borders.

RATING: 6
Slightly cliched euro fun. The game is driven by a worker rondel where the number of meeples that end up on a space determine the actions you can use.

Has that been done before? The mechanic feels like a more complicated version of Finca. It's quite cool, if a tad mathy.

My issue is that the actions you're working towards feel so very familiar. A tile market here,a quarry there. Nothing feels original.

Played a 5 player game. Alchemist bottom row (and to a lesser extend, middle row) is so strong that the first player there was unstoppable. Maybe all players have to go there in a game with high player count? Ornament shortage might be intended, but again encourage leeching and hoarding instead of working on the palace. Rating still somehow high because i have hopes for the game at lower player counts; likely won't play again with 5.

The greatest architects and designers of France compete for the favor and recognition of King Louis XIV by finalizing the construction of Versailles. Meeples advance along pathways and roads to worker areas to perform different building actions towards puzzle solving tile placement of the gardens and palace. What separates this game from traditional worker placement is the limited action choices depending on where the meeples are located along the road routes. This must be accounted for in timing and sequence of moves. The worker upgrade system adds a twist by granting indirect benefits when an opponent performs an action.

We played the game a bit wrong, but the game still showed some interesting mechanics. Not sure its innovative and special enough for me to want to play it all the time. But I wouldn't reject it if I wanted to play a lighter worker placement game.

Thought that this would be a heavier game. Then realized that this is a simple game. No bad so far. But then we had to repeat the same actions again and again doing the same things again and again with the end game conditions looking so far from triggering. After that I realised that the palace was blocked from placing new tiles as a result of combined bad play and destruction strategy. The game should have ended immediately. Instead we kept doing the same actions all over again with only aim to gather useless components that would give to all players the same amount of additional victory points. Too bad. The developers should have foreseen this and alter some rules, especially for the game end trigger conditions. Pretty disappointed.

Need to play this one more.  I have 2 plays, one with 5 players and the other with 2.  I like the modular board and the optional assistant variant.  There is much to this game that is still unexplored.

RATING: 5
When you use the long routes or a randomized set, the game improves. I'm not sure the route deduction is enough to keep me interested (the dice don't bother me, so much as I'm not sure it just rings hollow, dunno). I did like that there were penalties for landing on a spot with someone else so planning your ending spot and looking at other players become more important.

RATING: 7
Fun pick up and drop off race for gems with the only variety coming from a random layout (although that's probably sufficient). Not sure if it has enough legs for many plays though, and the rules explanation feels a bit cumbersome for the game's weight.

A race game where the goal is to be the first to collect a set number of rubies, while travelling/route-planning on a modular board.

On your turn, you move your stack of pieces in a limited fashion (orthogonal, and up to 2 spaces) and either collect a piece you left behind on a tile and perform the action of that tile/location or leave a piece of your stack behind and perform the action (this movement is very similar to Dorn's Traders of Genoa).  There are several different tiles with different actions but they generally consist of: a) getting more resources to put in your wagon, getting money, acquiring rubies (which generally require expenditure of money and/or resources), and acquiring abilities/benefits (such as an upgraded wagon, special powers).  There are a few characters which you may encounter on your travels and you can interact with them for a small fee resulting in a small bonus.

This game is relatively simplistic even though it is somewhat interesting.  Having played the base game and the expansion, I wouldn't go back without the expansion as it adds some more options/paths to a game that's pretty limited decision-wise.  I'm a bit surprised for the love this game is getting, even as a hardcore Rudiger Dorn fan, I'd rate this about his 5th best game.  Only played as a 2er, but it works very well at that count, which is a real plus.  Very nice components.

We love this game. The theme fits right in with what we like - the marketplace/bazaar feel. Being able to randomize the board also helps give it a lot of replayability. The short paths map that the game suggests you start with definitely eases you into learning how to play, but it does it old after only a few plays. Once you start doing the long paths, or just a random layout, it is a lot of fun. I also like the short turns, meaning it feels like it moves quickly, instead of waiting on other people for too long.

Jogo OK. A mecânica de movimentação deixando os assistentes nos lugares é bem legal, mas falta um pouco de emoção durante a partida. Talvez com mais partidas ele se torne rapido o suficiente para ter um sentimento mais de filler do que de jogão. Jogaria de novo, facilmente.

Nothing tremendously new here, and not a lot to pick this over Royal Palace or Louis XIV which have similar mechanics. Perhaps this is a worthy upgrade, but still very familiar. That said, as dry optimisation exercises go, this is a good one. A standard, sensible, Euro game. I enjoyed it but wasn't excited by it.

2 plays / 5 players (1 play w/expansion)

LIKE: Quick, even with full 5 players. Feels good to create efficient routes, buying and selling. Unique path mechanism.

DISLIKE: A little light. Dice rolling, then searching for the tile, slows things down. Player interaction could be lacking with less players.

OVERALL: Okay game for a mid-weight gaming group, but not much player interaction except for the occasional inadvertent blocking. I don't see how this can be exciting with less players.

This one is well known perhaps (certainly is around BGG) and I had high expectations. It certainly did not disappoint! The mechanics are very smart - move your stack, drop/pick up a disk to take the target action. Pay other players if they are already there. And to spice it up a bit, have special pieces to move around (and capture). There are 16 location boards that can be arrange in countless ways - so a level of replay-ability for sure. After that, alot of standard Euro goodness: 5 different resources, convert to money and then to rubies (the objective of the game is to get 5 rubies). It allows for a variety of plans to be made, paths to be taken - and just a touch of random luck (a few locations use dice) and a dash of confrontation (you can get in other's ways).

Anyhow, very deserving I think of the Spiel gamer's award. Very happy to have this one and will be anxious to play.

Year 2014 seems to be the year of worker movement games. I quite like the mechanic of moving your worker in a grid of action spaces. This really forces you to plan ahead to gain synergy from your moves.

However, there is one thing that I am not so fond of. This is the abrupt game ending. First, all players spend several rounds gathering speed, then everyone makes the final rush for diamonds which lasts for 3-4 rounds and then... game over. It is just my personal opinion but I rather scored points along the way working towards the final climax. I want to make decisions whether to score points now or risk my chances and try to score big in the end.

Anyways, solid mechanics and fun "plan ahead to synergise" type of game. Refreshing after classical worker placement and engine building games, I would say.

RATING: 6
*Rating based on one play.

I'd heard a lot of buzz about this game, but I found it to be a bit lackluster.  I feel like the way the game works with leaving your assistants behind on locations you visit encourages players to work out an optimized circuit of 3-5 tiles and simply visit them over and over again, which doesn't make for interesting play.  Granted I have only one play to base this observation on and so I could be completely wrong, but the game didn't really excite me in any other aspect to motivate me to test out my theory further.

I can't really put my finger on why it fell flat for me (beyond seeming to encourage repetitive strategies).  It has a lot of things I normally like in games: resource management, limited randomness, multiple paths to victory, some engine building and power comboing.  One thing that did sour me was the fact that I could see the game was won 2-3 turns in advance, and there was nothing I could do to make up the gap at that point.  It removed any suspense from the end game.

In the end, I guess I just didn't find the game's unique characteristic (the movement mechanics) interesting, so there was nothing to set the game apart from the dozens of other Euros I've played.

Not Constantinople is great game. The board is modular and has several configuration options to keep things interesting. The premise is that you are a merchant trying to collect a certain number of rubies first. You do so by moving around the board and triggering specific actions where you drop off subordinates, or as I like to call it, "pooping" on various spots of the board. This innovative pooping mechanic forces you to be efficient with the actions you choose because when you run out of poops you have to either go back to a spot where you left a turd or waste a turn activating a tile that allows you to collect all your poops back. The idea is to be as efficient as possible in executing various pick up and delivers as possible while creating synergies between certain board tiles so that you are minimizing your need to waste actions. Istanbul is a solid game... Poop.

The game is relatively simple but with an engine-building type of strategy. I like that type of game, but it can be a bit complex for casual players.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Even if I really enjoy euro-games, for some reason I never really pulled the trigger on this one. Now that I finally got a chance to play it, I can see how Istanbul is a really solid euro-style game and one that certainly deserves the following that it got. 

Everything about this production is really top-notch. The cardboard is nice and thick, the artwork is great, the components are high quality. All together the game is very visually appealing... and, as always with euro-games, Istanbul comes with an interesting and deep game-play.

I really like its base concept. It takes a different spin on the worker-placement genre, by mixing in a rondel-like mechanism and a very intriguing way of moving your pieces around. The rules are simple, but the game-play is very deep and challenging. You really need to figure out how to be the most efficient with the way you move your workers on the board. It's such a fascinating puzzle!

Yet, while I liked the game and I appreciate the design, Istanbul didn't excite me. I cannot even really point at what I would change to improve my experience with the game. I just think it's ultimately a bit seamy and it doesn't stand out enough from the crowd of the euro-game genre. Maybe I'll change my mind with future plays.

To sup up... I like Istanbul and I would definitively play it again. I can see how being more familiar with the mechanisms and the tactics of the game could make me like it more. It's just not one of those games that I keep thinking about when I'm done playing it. It's good... but not great, at least for me.

1st play: This was a smooth game, and I think it flows a lot better than Traders of Genoa. The breadcrumb mechanic is well implemented here, and the variable board means that there should be lots of replay-ability. Also, the components are nice and turns flow fast. If anything, the game was over too soon.

2nd play: Fast fun game, rules are very smooth to teach and people generally understand quickly how to play. I like the route building and with variable setups the game plays differently each time.

Man, what a great game. Unfortunately I haven't played as much as I would like it. It is the kind of game that when it is over I find myself thinking that it would be great if it had lasted a couple more rounds/turns, perhaps adding a couple more rubis to the end goal would be a nice "house rule" to solve it, but as I mentioned above I haven't played enough to fell confident about messing with the rules. Great component quality, even in the brazilian version that is produced by a mass market company (something like Hasbro I believe), a lot of variability due to the, almost, free arrangement of the places tiles. I like it a lot , but the rest of the folks in my house weren't as excited, perhaps an average 8 amongst the 4 of us.

I played this twice and I think it's really a nice little game.
We decided to just learn it from the rulebook (which was surprisingly easy and not something I tend to do at cons) and bashed through in a surprisingly short time for the player count.

I quite like it, but I'd need to play it a couple more times before buying because I suspect it's a little dry and samey.

Light eurogame where players travel around Istanbul with their cart, buying and selling goods. The first person who collects a certain amount of rubies is the winner. There are 4-5 different ways to collect a ruby so each player can select a different strategy. The game is tight and the player who manages to make better use of his action will be the winner. We played a 4 player game and it took us a bit less than an hour.

The action selection mechanism is great and the game plays smoothly. The game end and victory condition is refreshingly different than what’s usually expected in these kinds of games. The game end can be AP prone since everyone is trying to find a way to finish the game. The game works better with 4 than 5 players, especially if the starting place is in the corner. In a 5-player game it can be that the last player has to follow a path someone else is already choosing and he has to donate his starting money to the other player. This problem could have been nicely solved by giving one more coin for each player in the beginning. This way the fifth player would have 7 coins and he could pursuit for the extra storage right in the beginning.

Istanbul is a fairly easy grid moving game with a modular board. The task is simple: get to 5 (or 6) gems as fast as possible. The challeging part is that you have to leave one of your discs behind each time you move, and you need a disc to perform actions. You therefore have to carrefully plan every move, in order to get your discs back. Not the best game ever, but certainly very enjoyable to play, especially with newcomers since it is easy to understand and play

A well designed "special action tiles in a variable matrix" game that manages to provide a pleasing gaming session.

Just wasn't that interesting and failed to really impress us. Sold since we had no interest in playing it again.

 This one clearly ranks as one of our favorite Euros. A worker placement game with simple rules and just enough strategy to keep you thinking from the first move to the last. You move about Istanbul (was Constantinople!) collecting wares and selling them or using them to buy the rubies you need to win the game. Along the way you gamble, have your near do well family go out & do some business for you and even visit a beautiful fountain. The production is top notch and the theme is fairly strong if off-putting to some. We love it a lot. We are really hoping an expansion or two might come out because that will make this already great game a perfect 10 possibly.

Played demo at GenCon 2014.

Very interesting and reminds me of Trade of Genoa (without the negotiation) meets Blue Moon City.

You collect goods, exchange them for money, which you then in turn exchange for victory points (completing wheelbarrow, completing add-ons, changing resources/money into victory points).

The escalating cost of exchanging into victory points is very similar to Blue Moon City and causes a very anxious game where you have to out-race other people.

Update: Played a second time and it kinda fell flat.  What was interesting the first game became repetitive in the second.  Downgrading it to a 7, possibly a 6. .

I played the "mocha" version, with a game board of 20 spaces, each with a different option-- far too many for my taste. I like the idea of the game, but not the implementation. I'm somewhat tired of "get gems" games as well. I suspect the basic version would be less complex and I might rate it a bit higher, but a different theme on a 3 x 3 (9 spaces) board would likely work a lot better for me.

RATING: 9
A very unique puzzle that plays really smoothly and surprisingly fast. The game is about being efficient with your movements and finding a circuit that gains you resources and money, while picking your workers back up. There are many paths to victory. Players can have very different strategies and still be neck and neck at the end. Gameplay matches the theme really well, and the artwork is delightful.

The only thing I dislike is that near the end of the game, players can see who has won and how many turns it will take for him to finish. For that reason, it can be anticlimatic as players helplessly watch someone win when they can't do anything about it.

Historically, I haven't been critical of Euros in general as cube/point-conversion engines.  Here I will.  For whatever reason, this entirely functional game was an exercise in boredom for me.  Lots of decisions, none of which I felt actually mattered.

Fun game! The game plays well with 4-5 players. With less players the market feels emptier and the optimal path is easier to discern. With more, the game becomes a bit too chaotic, but really makes it feel like you're running around a bustling market.

~10 Play Update: Getting too predictable. I wish there were more location tiles for a variable set of locations. Dropping score to 7 since I don't want to play as much anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
This is an excellent game of activating various tiles for their economic opportunities while you spread your stack of merchants about the bazaar. I love the tough choices you have here...go straight for the rubies, gamble, collect goods for trade, or regroup your merchants at the fountain tile. Being able to upgrade your merchant board is also wonderful, and variable setup of the tiles lends it a lot of replay value. Just all around greatness, and it deserves the hype it garnered.

RATING: 5
This is a medium-weight race game with resource management, push-your-luck actions, and a unique logistic/abstract puzzle where players must drop/pick-up workers to do actions; If you don't plan ahead, you may not be able to do actions or do them as efficiently. 

That being said, I am hesitant to call this game an "euro." Many things (Dice rolling, Card Drawing) can swing the game significantly and the variance/influence of the randomizers are not well controlled. The game essentially plays like an elaborate push-your-luck game. 

Is it bad? For those that enjoy the gambling tension that dice and powerful cards can bring... this may provide an enjoyable experience. But for euro-gamers that detest their decisions being mitigated/limited by dumb luck, I can see this having a short life. That being said, the game is relatively simple and plays quite fast... as long as you don't take it too seriously, it may prove enjoyable.

Great game, good replayability. Slightly unbalanced with the red mosque tile (should probably change it, so that you can only re-roll a 1 to a 4 or something) but otherwise a solid, fast paced game if you don't play with people suffering from analysis paralysis. Some say that the Sultans Palace is overpowered, but never found that it was the case.

Winner of the Kennerspiel de Jahres (2014).

Fantastic game, elegant and breezy. Plays quickly, so the only negative - you can usually see defeat coming a turn or two before the game actually ends - is mitigated by the speed of replay. Pre-set or randomized layouts mean a Dominion-like replayability. Game strategy mostly consists of finding best routes for a given arrangement and how you might disrupt someone else's patterns.

Lots of fun, and its quick and easy replay means multiple games per session.

Váratlanul úgy alakult, hogy Istanbult játszottunk. Nos, nagyon kellemes meglepetés volt, szerintem hangulatban, változatosságban kenterbe veri pl. a Five Tribest. Elég sokutasnak tűnik, és vannak jó ötletek benne. Pl. a 3 irányított játékváltozat elegánsan van megoldva, de persze lehet random összeállítással is játszani. A gyémántszerző helyek jók, az épületek úgy általában sokszínűek és jópofák, pörgős az egész, mindenhol kapunk valamit, jó és jobb lehetőségek közül lehet választani, és azt mondom még hangulata is van, ahogy pl. különböző emberekkel lehet találkozni. Ebben a kategóriában szerintem az egyik legjobb. Mondjuk családinak nem nevezném, annál komolyabb azért, de gémereknek jó könnyed átvezető. Néhány épületben komoly szerencsefaktor lapul, de nem muszáj odamenni:)

Istanbul is a neat and polished efficiency game.

Players move their merchants plus assistants' stacks on a 4x4 grid, performing the action of the tile on which they arrive (only if they can add or remove an assistant to/from the stack).

Every tile in the grid has its own special action, usually concerning acquisition/selling of wares or money.

There are a couple of more twists related to family members, smuggler and governor.

The goal is being first to acquire 5 (or 6 in a two player game) rubies.

A well deserved Kennerspiel des Jahers, I am keen to explore and try with different numbers of players.

The movement mechanic reminded me of Escape from Alcatraz although the options are more refined and better balanced. The use of dice will always be frowned on by me but in this case they don't really sway things that much. The balance seems to be to strive for gems early on and a fully developed attack on tiles and cart sections appears to leave you fighting it out for 2nd-5th.

I'd play again but don't see enough to warrant a purchase.

Second Play: The shine was not there with a return visit. There seem to be trite combos that allow a circuit of actions that sweep up gems once the die modifier is in hand. Really not a game I'd want to play again.

I like worker placement and this game adds a unique spin to the formula with its spacial and timing aspect.  There are many viable paths to victory and the strategy can change based on how you set the board up.  One of the best things about Istanbul is that it keeps moving.  Turns are lightning quick, even in a 4 player game, and there is a great tension in seeing if someone else will get in the way of your best laid plans.  A deserving winner of the KDJ.

This looks like a solid game! But I really hope that the game uses thick cardboard for the locations. And avoid having round corners/cards.

Ostensibly a market/trading game, but really more like a tense, quickfire race game in which you have to plot out the most efficient route to grab five rubies before your opponents. It's kind of like a worker placement game, but the placement requires more spatial thinking and you can't block other players, just hinder them slightly on their way. My favourite thing about Istanbul is that, after an initial infodump explaining what all the locations do, the game is incredibly intuitive and easy to pick up, and it plays super quickly (the 40-60 minutes on the box is accurate).

Every once in a while there is a game that, for no reason you can clearly explain, just clicks with you. I wouldn't normally describe myself as a fan of games that are mechanical exercises; where you do this to get that, and use that to get the other thing that's worth points. It's not that I hate them, I just usually think of myself as someone who enjoys a good theme over a good mechanism. But Istanbul makes so much sense once you get over the hurdle of learning the game, and I love thinking 3 to 4 turns in advance to plan out how you will get points. This is a game that I am afraid I will struggle to get people interested in, but I will want to play all the time. Definitely one I love, and will recommend to others.

Istanbul is a light medium weight game with an interesting mechanic in regards to how you move your workers. The components are gorgeous and the gameplay is engaging. It is a race to see who acquires a certain amount of rubies first. The replay-ability seems abundant due to the interchanging board tiles and plethora of options. 

I enjoyed the decision standpoints and the angst of the race. All of this is done in a short and quick playtime which accentuates it's charm. Any longer and it would outstay it's welcome.

My friends were right: Istanbul is such an innovative game!

It succeeded so cleverly in the undreamed-of task of switching an eurogame’s main focus from randomly collecting wooden cubes to picking up plastic gems randomly without even changing the overall dry and themeless atmosphere of such games in the slightest: for this deed alone Istanbul will be remembered as the one game that changed boardgaming forever.

Wow.. I really liked this one.  It plays great with 2p, and I  imagine it works well with even more players.  Also, we played without the neutral token, but I would definitely play with that to make it more interesting.  I love the variety the game offers, with random setups.  This one offers a ton of meaty choices, all with a pretty simple ruleset.  Something that is definitely trending up for me!

A fun game. I liked the strategy around moving so you are collecting your assistants back as you move rather than returning to the fountain after every four or five moves. This became more evident on a second play. My one question is whether you will end up following the same pattern of steps every game.

// This game was a pleasant surprise when we picked up a
copy. I wasn't sure if it'd work for me or not since I
don't really have other games in this category (pick up
and deliver, I guess?), but this was definitely a hit for
us right away. The only drawback is that while I'd like to
play it more often, there's a decent amount of setup to it
which is somewhat of a turnoff for such a light game.

An enjoyable pick-up-and-deliver game with a bit of worker placement, only one action potter turn and a fairly unique action restriction mechanism involving a stack of discs.  The disc stack represents your potential since you must leave a disc (apprentice) behind each time you perform a building tile's action.  Once all of your discs are out on the board, you need to go back and pick them up (relating those actions if you can) or spend a turn (or more) moving to the fountain building and calling your discs back to you, unless you have a special ability (e.g., bonus time) allowing you to reclaim discs another way.  You can only perform a few actions before getting overextended, then you need to reclaim discs in order to continue performing actions, meaning that you need to repeat certain actions or spend a turn calling your discs (apprentices) back to you; this makes the game tricky, challenging and fun.  Finding an efficient route/loop is very important, but other players may (and should) interfere too stop you from exploiting that route to the fullest... thus preventing an easy win.  The modular board will make each game different from the last, but over time, the base building actions may grow boring.  That said, I suspect that printable fan-made or official expansion buildings will emerge to spice it up.

The flow of the game is top notch. The beautiful artwork and theme makes this a great short- ish game. This I an efficiency game that has a great game mechanic of loading up on produce and developing greater cart capacity to trade in for Lira to buy rubies or you can skip the sale process and trade for rubies instead. This game has great replay ability due to the separate tiles in which you essentially create the game play area. Plays well with 2,3 or 4 so far. My 11 year old loves it as well and has played it with his friends.

RATING: 7.5
First of all, Istanbul is a racing game! Whoever gets 5 gems first, wins the game... and usually racing games are not my cup of tea.

But this one is good! The artwork is stunning, colorful tiles (the board), with good looking red gems.

The gameplay is fluid, the turns don't take too long to execute, and since you do the action of the place where you have landed on, there's not much to think about. Very intuitive and elegant gameplay.

The family members and the penalty for merchant encounters creates some interesting interaction.

There's a variety of ways to get gems. But I feel, in some board setups, the first player has some advantage 'cause there are ideal/obvious choices that can put you ahead of the race, early in the game. Experienced players will take it, for sure.

But since there some pre-set setups, it adds replayability and strategy changes. You can randomize it if you want to, although it's not recommended.

It got a couple of awards and it's easy to understand why!

The length it's just fine!

- great strategy game where the winner is the first person who find the way to gather 5 rubies (6 for 2 players)
- it is not just about planning, it is also fight with time
- at each location in the game (16), you can carry out a specific action
- you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind. If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. You don't want to stay without them because merchant can't do actions alone.. Mechanics many can know from "Genua" & "Goa" ;)
- it is kind of the game where one bad decision can cost player a loss
- game has strong theme, You can feel it while playing
- playing time (40-75 minutes)
- I had to change dices (basic, white) in the game - wanted to add some Istanbul theme to it.

5 players* - it is more chaotic but still awesome. I enjoyed the 5 players game the same as head to head.

STRONG RECOMMENDATION.

Other games created by Rudiger Dorn worth look at: GOA (my rate - 9), GENUA

But if You are looking for the game for 2 players only (with a  great theme too) try "TARGI" instead of this one.

**I have Kebab Shop mini expansion.

Un juego sencillito, casi familiar, en el que el tablero se forma con una serie de losetas (16 losetas) sobre las que los jugadores se pueden jugar con mercaderes y una serie de ayudantes. Van todos en pila. Cuando llegan a una loseta, para usar la acción relacionada, debe dejarse un ayudante. OTra posibilidad es recoger un ayudante en una loseta de destino. Eso le da un poco que pensar. El objetivo es ser el primero en conseguir 5 gemas. Cada loseta te permite obtener una serie de recursos que se pueden luego usar en otras acciones, para conseguir las preciadas Gemas. 

Está divertido. Es entretenido y tiene muy buena producción. Apto, e incluso recomendable, para no jugones.

Played the beginner set up, and saw how planning ahead is vital to efficient collection of rubies as I had some wasteful moves. I can see this being more interesting and difficult using the variable set up. Play time is acceptable for what it offers, coming in at just under an hour (not including set up). Looking forward to future plays. Second play - random set up. A little more interesting making us figure out how to order our movements through the places.

Great game, absolutely brilliant in fact, but as yet unable to articulate exactly why. The game does seem to balance agonising turn-by-turn decisions against your overarching strategy perfectly though - particularly if someone unwittingly changes the board state in your favour or, more annoyingly, against it. Every time I have played the game everyone at the table has immediately wanted to play it again - and we often did. Furthermore, the game is so easy to set up etc also and incredibly affordable. Looking forward to playing this one more and investigating the expansions currently on the market.

This game plays fast and so far it's been really addicting. I like the way movement functions in this game where your merchant either drops off or picks up assistants. This adds a layer of strategy that feels very new to me. I'm also a huge fan of the fact that this is basically a racing euro. You basically run from location to location while watching your opponents to make sure that they're not going to get one over on you and steal the game.

A solid family game elevated by two excellent expansions into a very entertaining, medium-weight, gamer's game. The fixed board layout makes long-term strategic plans possible, complicating them with tactical obstacles/considerations (merchants or other players' pawns) and little bits of randomness (die throws, card draws). Turns are always fast, decisions are tense, and scores are tight. I can't see myself playing without the Great Bazaar (e.g. both expansions) from now on. 

Although there is some disagreement about this, I love the 2-p. game, and think the dummy system works really well.

Quick additional comment: I like this game a lot at the 45-60 minutes advertised play time (which is what I see the vast majority of the time). But it can be a possible AP trap, and if the game goes 90 minutes it's at best a 6-rated game for me. I don't think it's the game's fault in this case; players need to play in a timely manner. But the potential is there, if you have a problem player.

---

This is an excellent Rüdiger Dorn game that I think I would have absolutely loved as recently as maybe 5-7 years ago, but I now I find that while I like it and think its very good and I recommend it to most gamers, it just doesn't quite grab me. The generic "medieval traders" has just been done so completely to death at this point that I find I miss the nice world-building of Blue Moon City or the high interactivity of Traders of Genoa, just to pick a couple games that are in the same sort of ballpark of special-powers-plus-money-management. I think this is in the category of "it's not you, it's me" though; Istanbul really is an excellent, first-class game which I enjoy playing, but for me personally I'm now 20+ years into the German game phenomenon and this type of game is fine but is never going to win Chris' personal game of the year. It's just too much like too many other games that I have spent too much time playing.

A really neat route optimization game, where the "hook" is that you have a dude that moves around with his posse to various tiles that allow you to do different things.  In order to do stuff at a tile, you either need to drop a member of your posse, or be rejoining a member of your posse (that you dropped off there in a previous turn).  So, you can't just run around will nilly, as spreading your posse all over the place leaves you with very few options.

However, after a few games, the game quickly started feeling repetitive. Yes, there's random set-up where you can see different optimal paths from game to game, but it still felt like I was doing mostly the same things, so the game flamed out for me prettyy quickly.

It's always a bad sign for me when I love a game within 5 minutes of starting to play it, because it means I am going to lose badly.  It happened with Splendor and it happened with Vikings.  Both games I eventually had to buy and Splendor is my most played game of the past 4 months.  So much to do, and you just need to keep your head in the fact that this is a race game.  Get your money, get your "power-ups", get your goods, and use em to get your gems.... but most importantly get those gems before anyone else!  I absolutely want more of this game.  It also made me want to play Louis XIV again as well!  Since I already own that one.

It is so refreshing to play something new and trendy and have it not be a disappointment. There's a lot to like with Istanbul. The movement restriction makes for a fun little puzzle, and the way you're penalized for sharing a space keeps things dynamic. It's a very tactical game, but still requires forward planning. Plus, the "race" component is a breath of fresh air and really gives the game a different feel from most midweight Euros. I'd happily play this anytime.

This is a pretty good light game. We played the short walk version, and it came in at 40 minutes with rules explanation! But it feels more substantial than a filler. 

There is very little interaction, as you are really just trying to figure out the optimal path. I can see there being very little variation between games, and the luck element of rolling for money/goods does seem a bit outsized for the game, but it still plays so quickly and smoothly that all is forgiven. Maybe its just having played so many kickstarters and absurdly complex games in recent years that it is nice to see a professionally designed and developed game just hum along, even if it is nothing special.

First Time playing this game and I thought the game to be good. I was a little disappointed because I did expect more from it. The game felt kind of repetitive because the goal is to gain enough rubies to win and one could repeat the same strategy all game. I did see some good replay value from the random setup allowing a different game every time. It was a surprisingly fast game and It was good, nothing I need to own, but something wouldn't mind playing.

I was a bit surprised that this played pretty well with two and quickly (under an hour) for both of us playing it for the first time. It is a race and if you can find an optimal path you can bounce between then you will have an advantage, but even that can be a little hard. Played again with more and it's even better. Definitely a keeper and looking forward to trying with the expansion.

I don't know, Istanbul just wasn't a good fit for us. My husband and I normally only play 2 player games, and I think this one needs more players to make it work. Once you find a strategy that works you just basically beat it into the ground until someone wins. I wish there was a way of varying the game a little better, so that it wouldn't get stale so fast. Maybe the expansions offer this variant, but I was so underwhelmed with the game that I just wasn't willing to try them.

Very good game that can test your movement efficiency.  However, the start player strength can make the game very unbalance.  No problem for 2 players but not too suggested for more than 2 players except with sufficient compensation.

RATING: 9.5
The little hopscotch mechanic makes this game work so well. Pretty easy to teach, pretty easy to understand what you're supposed to be doing, but a bit trickier to figure out how to do it in the fastest way. The whole experience of figuring out how to maximize that efficiency feels rewarding. There's real decisions. Not too much weight on it. Art is fantastic and inviting. When it comes to euros, this is what I like to see.

Highly tactical. Perfectly serviceable euro with a bit of charm. Get five gems. Four ways to get gems. One requires money. One requires goods. The others require more time and some goods or money. Those methods increase your capacity or give you special powers. The movemement rules require a slight bit of planning. Overall, a fine little game. Nothing special.

RATING: N/A
Winner of the Kennerspiel Des Jahres 2014, the highest board game award for strategic games, and for good reason. This game is decently simple to learn, especially if you are familiar with worker placement games. Players take on the role of a merchant in the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul trying to have a better merchant empire than the other merchants and collect the most rubies. This game plays great anywhere from 2-5 players and has some interesting twists on old mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have played five times, and have won all five times, using the same basic strategy.  I am convinced that this strategy dominates all other strategies independent of board layout so long as other players do not attempt to interfere.  I do not expand my wheelbarrow or frequent either of the mosques, preferring instead to use the Post Office, Black Market, Sultan's Palace, and Gemstone Dealer almost exclusively, with stops in the Warehouses and Caravansary as needed.  Depending on board layout, this approach ranges from marginal (second place player is within two actions of a win) to devastating (second place players had only two gems).  Does this mean the game is broken?  No, because if other players adopt the same strategy, it will reduce its efficiency to the point where other strategies (i.e., Wainwright and Mosque) will likely succeed.  It will be interesting to see if the gameplay of Istanbul evolves or stagnates over time.

RATING: 3
UPDATE 8/16: Played it again and ... still no. Is it fair to look down on this game because I like another (thematically similar, mechanically very different) game by the same designer way more? No? Screw it, I'm doing it anyway. This game is not fit to wash Genoa's jockstrap. It's an efficiency-over-actions puzzle/race without the slightest hint of meaningful player interaction. I'm capable of liking games with that profile -- I like Le Havre ferchrissake -- but I usually find this sort of thing, well, boring. You may well like it. Lots of smart people with taste do, and there's no question it does what it sets out to do, I just don't care for what it sets out to do.

The Crunchy Frog of board games. Dew-picked and flown in directly from Iraq, lightly killed, lovingly frosted with glucose, the whole nine, and all that's as may be but it's still a frog.

(And by "frog," in this case I mean "generic puzzly cube-pushing Euro with no discernible theme and minimal interaction.")

Istanbul does what it sets out to do and does it in a reasonable time frame, I just feel like I've seen everything it sets out to do before, and I would rather put my time to more engaging ends.

This one was a hit. Really like the modular board. After playing it over a dozen times, it is fun to come up with a set-up that we haven't seen before, like placing all the warehouses in the corners or placing mosques and markets all in the same row. 

I really don't see any flaws with the game and don't think there is any superior strategy. As I like to play games casually, I really appreciate rolling dice every once in a while. However, even when I'm extremely lucky, that does not win me the game, so it's balanced.

I only played the game with two players so far, and I think it's very strategic in this constellation. Before playing, you can pretty much come up with a general plan of what to do, and there isn't that much interaction that can block the execution. The biggest conflict comes with the mosque tiles, especially with the blue one.

If absolutely nothing else, the mechanic of moving the little stack of disks around makes me very happy. I enjoy the challenge of trying to make the best of whatever board layout you get even if it means that sometimes cheap combos can happen. Really eager for more plays and to try the expansion.

Worker placement with a twist. I like it, but I like the twist on the genre that another worker placement game from this year took a bit more. Presents much more of a puzzle than other worker placement games. The twist makes you rather more reliant on other player's moves, thus making it difficult to plan ahead. Can make what should be a rather quick worker placement game turn into overly long games with AP-prone players. The modular board (well, tiles) adds replayability, always a plus. I personally would not have given it the 2014 Kennerspiel des Jahres over Rococo.

Great game.  Modular board can add variety to each playthrough.  Easy to pick up and teach, plenty of planning required between turns to figure out where you will move your Merchant (& stack).

Will say that at 2-players, it seems a little off as you have to use dummy player markers on the board, and roll for them to move if they are encountered, similar to the Ambassador.  Would suggest 3-4 player count.

Will look at acquiring one (or both) of the boxed expansions at some point in the future.

Istanbul is one of those rare games I instantly fell in love with despite having an oriental theme (which I generally don't like) and despite losing every game so far. There is a lot going on in this game giving you a lot of options to go for, including a pleasant amount of player interaction. I also like the design of the game (again, despite the theme). It manages to neatly capture the theme without sacrificing clarity. Also, since it's a Pegasus game, I expect it to be available for a bargain price soon. (This is for the Pegasus Spiele German edition (2014).)

It's nice to see Rüdiger Dorn return to his 'breadcrumbs' mechanism. In this particular case the breadcrumbs can be re-absorbed into the main draw pile creating more of an accordion-like (caterpillar-like?) effect that stretches and contracts across the board... although with a recall part of the charm of this analogy is lost.

Of course what the players are after is nothing special and worthy of comment. Collect resources here, bring them over there, transform them into rubies/VP, race to the end. All you need to know further is what is done where and how actions are effected, no special remarkable features here. In the first game I played I was unpleasantly surprised by the inherent luck in the 2D6 rolls which are barely mitigated, causing me to wonder why people were allowed to receive expensive blue goods or a nice amount of spare pocket money for nearly free. However, I was at the time unaware of the effect of the mosque tiles (especially the tile which gives you a random good for 2 lira if you stock up), and also not really making use of the bonus cards. Both are sufficiently powerful to avoid the use of the dice altogether, or at least make you stock up in what appears to be a reasonably equal tempo. So in that the game is more balanced than I initially assumed. Still, I don't think it is a Good Idea to include such raw dice mechanisms in games in this day and age: we've spent a decade working out how to do better with dice, and all that knowledge is blatantly thrown out the window here.

The above grumbling aside, the game itself purrs along without too much problems. At the lower end of the player scale people rarely need interfere with each other, although I have to say I found the mechanism to send someone else's family member back to prison to be nastier than I thought: if you place the family member in a spot where noone ever visits, then you won't get him back all that easily either.

In the end, I think that what is going to end up happening is the following: there are not many ways in which you get the rubies, and the corresponding prerequisites do not change either. So you'll be walking similar paths over and over again, with the winner being the player who traced out the most efficient path. The only variation is that some paths are at times longer, and at times shorter. I'm not saying that spotting the correct path is easy, so the game tends to promote a bit of 'mucking about' and 'learning by doing' every time. I doubt this is a pattern you'll keep on coming back to again and again after you've played it a few times. And that raises questions about who this game is acutally for. There are quite a few rules to make it fall under the family game-aegis; yet the patterns it creates are not, in my opinion, sufficiently interesting to draw in enthusiast gamers. I have decided to increase my initial rate by a point to reflect my increased understanding of how all elements work together... but it's going to stay put at this number for some time to come, I fear.

A very solid strategy game - once you get past the rules it's easy to dive in. Players make a mad dash to produce enough resources to get the precious gems for a win, but the movement rules keep anyone from running away too quickly.

Does grid movement and pickup and deliver sound good to you combined? How about roll and move? Oh just shut up gambling high number at the tea house is pretty much roll and move and I land on you is from freaking Sorry. I know what the game has in it I just played it, if you can even call what we were doing that...I don't. You have to have a decent game to have any kind of play going on. 

Do you like light family style games? If so, then by all means buy this game and play it and celebrate your life.

At no point and time did I ever feel like I was playing a game while trying this one out. I wouldn't say that about Queen's Architect. 

I hate this one more than I hate Above and Below and before this moment I did not think that was possible. I won't record a play for either title because I felt like they were not games.

Outstanding family game! 

Just got this and played 5-player including three kids ages 9-14. Rules are simple and everyone understood basics and general strategy in one read-through. Everyone really liked it due to simple mechanics and rules, but many difficult choices. 

Other plusses: Clear scoring - First to 5 rubies is the winner and everyone can see your progress. Close game - everyone was in position to win all the way through. Quick gameplay and fast turns - I think we can get in a complete game in 45 min, a big plus with younger kids. 

This is going to be a top go-to game in our house because of the reasons listed above.

(Edit: my opinion of Istanbul has changed since getting the game expansion. This game is vastly improved with Istanbul: Mocha & Baksheesh)
Originally, this game was disappointing.  It is essentially a race to collect 5 to 6 gems first.  Even with a random setup, the game is uneventful and usually the victor is a runaway winner.  Once your behind, there is little you can do to catch up which makes for a disappointing game.  I am beginning to lean toward selling this one (not anymore!).

Now, I like this game a lot more.  With the expansion, there are more options for getting gems and it is possible to catch up when falling behind.  With more options, it is a tighter game.  I really like the movement mechanism in this game.  Istanbul is a pretty good game.

Istanbul is a solid pickup-and-delivery game. The main mechanism that requires you to drop an assistant with every move rewards careful route planning. The winner is usually the one with an efficient circular route that allows collection of resources and conversion of them to ruby (= victory points) in one round. The variable tile layout allows for replayability.

The game plays pretty easy and fast, there's little down time. It takes a few turns before you know all the tiles, but then it's fairly straightforward. You gather goods, sell these for money and buy rubies or instead deliver them to the sultan for rubies.

The Sultan's route is a bit more complex, as you'll need blue goods (jewelry) as well, which cannot be gathered at the warehouses, but need to be won by throwing dice (7 or up gets you one or more Jewels). 

People who usually are unlucky with dice can avoid this by acquiring a card that lets you buy jewely at the warehouses or a different card that allows you to change one die of throw again.

As you need to leave your assistants behind (to take care of the paper work or something), you need to plan your route carefully. Luckily, you can always return to the fountain and recall your assistants there.

The fun part is that you encounter people on your way, other Merchants, the governour, the smuggler or one of the "nephews", either your own or someone elses. The other Merchants have to be paid off before they allow you to perform the action, the governour and the smuggler allow you to buy cards or goods and the nephews can be sent to jail for a reward. You can even turn in your own kin. 

All in all, Rudiger Dorn has put together another nice game. I see some resemblance to one of his earlier games Waka Waka, where the same goods (fruits, spices and silk) can be gathered and delivered for more status. We like that game as well, but this one is certainly more developed. 

As this is a modular board (all the 16 tiles of the market can be set up randomly), the most efficient way of moving around varies per game, so replayability is high. There's a nice alternative play as well, where one of your assistants has a neutral colour and can therefore be taken by one of your opponents.

Istanbul has a nice tile based board that offers a lot of options on replay and difficulty.  I like how this changes up the combos available from game to game when you are setting up your point engine.

I found this pretty bland, much like Dorn's other games with a similar mechanism. Run around the board, get stuff, go somewhere else, turn it in for points. I hear the expansion makes it better, but I don't really have enough interest to find out.

Update: played a few times recently both with the Mocha expansion and without, nd have liked it more. Experience with the game makes your options more obvious and the game more enjoyable.

The perfect bridge between a family game and a light euro game.
Though some symbologie that is present in the game can be  a bit confusing at spaces, the rules are quite easy to follow and teach, even for non gamers.
In spite of its symplicity, the game still provides room for the need to plan and optimize your actions, while there is some taste of a race between players to grab the resources at more affordable prices.
The game is also visually very nice and can be played in less than an hour. Putting all together, this is a very good game.

Simpler than average, quicker than average resource collection / conversion game. Play this game rather than one of many other similar games if planning movements so as to minimize "wasted" movements that replenish your forces sounds like fun. That aspect of the game reminds me of the bumping feature of Euphoria. In Euphoria, you hope to be bumped so that you can postpone retrieval; in Istanbul, you want to re-visit spaces so that you can postpone re-stacking.

In two games now I have yet to really feel the pain of running out of discs. Between cards and the upgrades, I've only used the fountain once.

RATING: 5
A pretty good game - rating of 7 after 2 plays with four players.

It's really a race game with different paths to victory.

Unfortunately, in the two games I played, the same player got the Mosque tile which allows you to re-roll or change dice early in the game and rode that to victory.

Will play more to see if there are "dominant strategies".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have only played it with five players and while fun and fast enough I think I'd enjoy it more with four. Perhaps the race for the mosque tiles will be more cut-throat with four? Not sure if it's good or bad. :)

I like the movement system and how you have to plan your moves, you can't always move to the perfect position due to lack of assistants or other players standing there as you have to pay them and sometimes you simply can't or aren't willing to do so which can totally disrupt your carefully laid plans.

Update: Better with four players. Played in less than an hour which is great.

RATING: 6
Fun game of moving around the tiles taking different type of actions.  Trying to find the most efficient path to victory.  I'm a bit concerned about it as most players can win within a turn or 2 of one another.  This often means that going first is a huge advantage.  Will have to play a few more times to see if this is true.  My initial rating of 7 is likely as high as this could go.  Wouldn't surprise if this started sliding down with repeated plays.

Update - With a random setup my opinion of this game is improved.  Every game isn't as samey.  I think a 7 is about where it will settle.  Probably should be somewhere between a 6 and 7 but I don't do halves.

Update - Not excited about playing this one any longer.  Adjusting downward to 6.

RATING: 8
Players are merchants, carting goods around Istanbul in a wheelbarrow.  Simple route planning game, where players move their stack of Merchant + Assistants one or two spaces around a 4x4 modular game board.  They then deploy/pick up an assistant there to take the space's action.  Actions are a nice mix of accumulating goods, cash, or converting stuff into rubies, which is what you need to win the game.

Very nice game, well designed, moves along well, fast playing time - almost a super filler, feels very old school and thank goodness, there is no worker placement.  Nice variety of strategies - and I love the fact you can try your luck with dice, or ignore that and go a more controlled route.  Certainly feels like a Dorn game - touches of Goa, Louis XIV, Traders of Genoa, etc.  Very impressed, liked it a lot.

Refreshing mid-weight Euro that isn't about churning points.  Rather, it's a race to gather 5 gems.  The pressure is on right from the first turn, and the game plays quickly.   The movement mechanism with the stacks of discs is clever, but the game doesn't depend on that wholly.  There might be a run-away leader issue, but that makes the early turns even more important.   Good stuff.

There's good reason why Istanbul won the Kennerspiel for 2014. Such a unique way to interpret a worker-placement style of gameplay. With the randomized board configuration, every game is an interesting question of the most efficient way to navigate the board and get those rubies.

[b][FirstImpression/PlayOnApril8th2014][/b] Finally get to play this game! I've had much anticipation when I first saw this game during Essen'13 demo. I have to admit, I was super excited about the game when I look at the components. Call it love at first sight. I also happen to like some of Rudiger Dorn's designs.

It's a simple and light game, and I like that it can handle up to 5 players. People who are familiar with Rudiger Dorn's design will feel somewhat at home when you see how the merchant and assistants move. I like how the mechanic of the Post Office board works (take four revealed icons and slide one down) as well as the Tea House (name a value and roll to see if you get the money). How the gems become expensive after each purchase is also neat as with each new purchase, you'll reveal a new cost/good needed for the next gem purchase.

This is not a deep game but I love the simplicity. It's right up my alley.

I played this with 5 and what was so enjoyable was the way that the game romped along so fast. Despite 5 players there was hardly any downtime. No sooner had you thought about your next turn for 30 seconds and your turn had came around again.  I can’t think of a 5 player game with this depth which plays so quickly.  I agree that its SDJ win is thoroughly deserved.  
But, and there is a but, I am not hugely excited about playing it again.  I will willingly do so, but it isn’t meaty enough to be the substance of a gaming evening, and yet it isn’t light enough to be filler or a family game.

After 1 Play: Fun pick up and deliver type game that involves making sure you can backtrack to fulfill certain spaces in order to pick up gemstones. The fun is in planning your next few turns, trying to beat people to locations and the game offers a few ways to get gems so while there is enough rubbing of elbows in the game, no one ever feels completely locked out. Its got just the right amount of the "I was going to go there" tension in the game (and even if someone takes your spot, you can too, you just have to pay more). Pretty much a perfect medium weight euro for us. Setup is a bit of a chore though.

After 5 Plays: I still want to pull this off the shelf. Solid game in our collection

This was a really pleasant satisfying experience to play. It feels like a combination of the kind light resource management and risk reward actions of modern euros and the spatial dimension of the old German games of the 90s. It is also rather simple and has that charming board game feel. I do wonder whether a human calculator could solve out the optimal move on any given turn however, it is rather deterministic and the player interaction is relatively low.

I've played it so far with two and three and I'm interested to see how it plays with four and five.

Istanbul is a pretty quick efficiency euro. It has a modular board which helps with the replay value, but has been criticized as having some uneven setups. I would recommend using [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1583507/balanced-place-tile-layout-german-board-game-champ]these rules[/url] if you aren't playing with an expansion. The basic idea of the game is to optimize your restricted movements on the board to take actions which will allow you to get gems. You can trade coins or goods for gems. You can also get gems via upgrading yourself with storage capacity or special abilities. The game is quick, attractive, and pretty easy to understand. In addition, people can feel competitive as it's a race to get 5 gems, which people generally stay pretty close to one another. With all that being said, I don't think there would be enough replay value for me to keep this one without playing with at least one of the expansions.

Only played about 5 times now, but I really enjoy it. Every game has been incredibly insanely close, to the point that I really feel with every turn, If I am not one step closer to claiming a ruby, then I just took a step backwards. This game is a race to the finish, your eyes darting from tile to tile, heart sinking with every permutation, and the feeling you get when grab that ruby... love it.

A game that is always more fun than I think it will be. Planning out routes is great and tactically fun. These routes always change too. Variety in tile placment is amazing.

Helps hide the fact that it is a race. A race that has a weird balance issue when it comes to one path being the better choice. Must play sparingly enough to minimize this.

Istanbul received a lot of attention when it was released.  Some players can get caught in the same part of the grid - cycling to support their strategy.  (It reminds me of a spin on Singapore.)  I tend to like spacial / abstract-type Euros so my rating is a bit higher than average.

RATING: 6
[1 play] This was a decently enjoyable light game. The most interesting thing to me was the mechanic of moving your stack around, dropping off and picking up workers. Apparently the designer (Rudiger Dorn) has done similar stuff in other games that I must not have played. But one of the players in my game opined that this wouldn’t have staying power, and I agree. This doesn’t seem like a game we’ll be playing in the years to come. One negative to me is that the scoring seems insufficiently granular. I won the game, the player after me would have won on her turn, and everyone else also had 4 rubies. It seemed likely to always be like that. Of course I allow the possibility that I haven’t gotten everything out of this game in one try, but that’s how it struck me. In the short term, I would be happy to play again but won’t intently seek it out.

Dorn's touch is definitely felt in the tile/movement element and random card draws as well as the resource conversion mechanisms.

RATING: 7
A perfectly playable middle weight euro in the quintessential sense. You scramble up tiles that offer actions and lay them out as the de facto board. Then you figure out an optimal path to take and try to adhere to it as much as possible but then people get in your way and start driving the cost up. 

Every time you move you have to drop a worker, so at some point you have to rewind to get your stack of workers back in your hand while hitting actions in an order that benefits you. The ostensible fun is doing that better than your opponents. It's logistics and action chaining efficiency; either that works for you or else it'll seem dull with a pasted on theme. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Feels like a classic euro. There are almost too many things you can do, with little need to plan ahead more than a turn or two, so it feels more tactical than strategic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I love, love, love:
- the race-style gameplay
- the mechanism of having a "leash" of workers that limits how far you can go on the board
- that the rules include an intro set-up

I dislike:
- that the setting is on an all-male extraterrestrial Earth-like planet
- that some of the places can really be combo-spammed over and over if a player is left unchecked
- that the game starts to seem too easy(?) once you know what you're doing
- whatever shady thing is going on at the post office

Final verdict: Love this clever mechanism, and I'll most likely be getting an expansion to add more places to visit/use.

When I first saw the box I never thought of bying it. But after playing once it was a must buy for me. Place the tiles randomly, the game is always different. THe key to tis game is making a good schedule and not changing course. Then the win is for the taking.

RATING: 7
Fun and easily accessible game that is a path resource collection game. There are several ways to get the required rubies to win, but ultimately the steps you need to get there remain the same and the game quickly becomes repetitive. Basically this is a game about path optimization.

Upgraded to 7. Better with the random or more complex setups.

RATING: 8.5
Really good game - playable with 5 players without downtime. Allways close. It seems slowing down a little bid in the middle of the game, after the first gems are collected by all players, but than it will be speed-up to the finish if two-three players collected their fourth gem, and became allways close.

Maybe not really a "Expert" game, but a little bit to much for the perfect family game like "Camel Up"! 
But with older children this could perfect fit.

Rating based on more than 10 plays and playing with the two expansions. Spiel des Jahres kennerspiel. It works very well as a family game, as well. Very tempting to try different strategies every time. The strategies seem balanced. It is always difficult to make a good "movement" game. If you position yourself well, you could end up moving back and forth between two tiles making you win the game at the end.

Rating based on 2 plays (1x5 players - easy board, 1x4 players - long board).  Lightweight game that is a good intro  to Euro style games and which plays fairly quickly - 45 to 60 minutes.   There is little "development" during the game, so once an optimum strategy is found for the board "as is" (given that the board is variable) then that is pretty much it.   Nice components well presented with a nice theme - easy to see why the is a 2014  Essen Kennerspiel nomination.  Those looking for the complex and very long game should look elsewhere.

RATING: 8
I really like the mancala-esque mechanic of moving your merchant and his followers around. You need to plan several turns in advance of where you would like to end up so that each turn you get to do the action of the space you land on (either because you leave a follower behind or you are picking one up) Missing out on an action because of the lack of a follower to drop off/pick up leaves you at quite the disadvantage.

you race around the board hoping to be the first to collect the required number of rubies which can be collected for various different actions.  The board being modular as well means set up will be different each time and thus strategy will change dependent upon this set up. 

The action spaces are simple and clear and the iconography very good. I like the subdued colour scheme.  I was not expecting much from this when I entered the game but I was very pleasantly surprised and really really enjoyed this one.

It's not going on my wishlist unless it dramatically improves with more than 2 players. It's a Rudiger Dorn game. Does that mean you get a stack of discs that you plonk around? Why, of course!

Standard fare, nothing new, over fiddly for what it is, fiddly little rules, but nothing exciting happens. I suspect there's more to it when more players are involved, but I'm not holding my breath.

This game hits a very satisfying spot for me.  I like the artwork, the ability to change the layout, the rubies, the theme, the goal, the length of the game, and the easy yet strategic play.  There is decent interaction--it is easy to get cut off from your planned actions, so a backup plan is important as well as thinking about where your opponents are headed.

RATING: 7
I quite enjoy this game.  The board randomizes every time, which helps with replayability.  However, it has two major downsides to me.  First, every time I play, it seems as though someone else win right when I feel as though I've got momentum going.  Winner is the first to collect five rubies (6 in a 2 player game).  I feel like it should be first to collect 10.  That may just be my play style working against me though.

The second downside is that, IMO, in a game with 4-5 players, the player who goes last, despite starting with extra coins, gets a significant disadvantage.  The game discourages them from going in a square any other player is in, and there's only a few squares that are actually useful to go to in the beginning few turns.  They're almost always occupied by other characters when it gets to the last player's turn.

Nem rossz játék. Tetszett a grafika, a mindig változó tábla, az embertojós munkáslehelyező mechanizmus. Nagyon gyors, elemi lépéseket teszünk, így a holtidő is alacsony, pörgős a játékmenet. Ami nem annyira tetszett az a nagyon arcba tolt szerencse szerep. A két kockadobós helyen elég nagy előnyre lehet szert tenni, egy-egy jó dobással. Pl. ha valaki az első körben kap két kéket (ezüst?), akkor azonnal viheti is vele a bónuszlapkát, ami igen nagy előny, mert a többieknek minimum hármat kell már ehhez gyűjteni, ami igen nehéz. Szuper jó játéknak tartanám, ha  a kockadobálás nem lenne ennyire hangsúlyos. Így csak átlagosan jó.

Istanbul is a Dorn game so, quite unsurprisingly, you get another implementation of his hallmark breadcrumbs mechanism here. Unfortunately, the game beyond those breadcrumbs is rather flat. If you look at some of his older designs (e.g. Louis XIV or Goa) you could claim that they mostly consisted of said breadcrumbs as well but in those titles, the game they supported was fairly tight. Each move you made mattered. Istanbul, on the other hand, is wide open. The spatial puzzle is not entirely without merit but the game is still just about squeezing a little more efficiency out of your moves than the competition. There are no big, decisive moves to be had. And in this light, breadcrumbs alone make for a rather paltry meal.

Streng betrachtet war auch bei ISTANBUL kein orientalischer Daniel Düsentrieb am Werk. Ein türkischer Flickenteppich aus zu Beginn mit kleinen Einschränkungen beliebig im Rechteck ausgelegten Plättchen mit unterschiedlichen Funktionen zum Sammeln, Kaufen, Optimieren mit dem Ziel, als Erster eine bestimmte Anzahl roter Rubine zu ergattern, die für das Auge auf einigen der Felder schön ausliegen. Doch trotz alledem Gewohnten und Rüdiger Dorns Neigung, sich und seine Mechanismen von GENUA bis GOA selbst zu zitieren, erreicht ISTANBUL mein Herz auf eine entzückende, leichtfüssige Weise, so dass ich geneigt bin, das Gateway-Spiel aus Herrn Dorns Eigenzitatwerksammlung als sein bis dato Schönstes zu betrachten, kurz vor der mit Marmorplatten gefliesten Einfahrt zum DIAMONDS CLUB.

Some ideas are neat and the gameplay matches the theme fairly well. I really liked the concept behind Istanbul while reading the rules. However, I had three big problems. Firstly, there are too many rules. I had to refer to them during our first game all the time. Secondly, I found that the coolest idea was that we had to leave our helpers behind and then find a way to get them. This gave a spatial element to the game tactics. But not enough for my taste: the board was a bit too small. It felt like they had this really cool idea but they also wanted to add a worker placement edge to the whole thing. So a large emphasis was on the variety of the actions at different locations. However, I am not a fan of worker placement, so this fell flat for me. Thirdly, there was almost no player interaction. There was some through a quasi supply-demand mechanism and we had to sometimes pay each other, but it was not enough for me.

All in all: Definitely not a bad game and I want to give it a try again sometime. It has some ideas I really like, but there were too little emphasis on them. Will definitely keep an eye on the designer.

I thought Istanbul would feel too much like recycled mechanics from other Dorn games, but I was quite wrong! Yes, it uses a similar "tower" mechanic as found in Genoa and Goa, but that's largely where the similarities end. Istanbul takes that mechanic and then uses a very simple quasi-worker placement system to gather resources and coins in order to buy jewels. But there are 16 different actions, some only variations of others and some that are unique and interesting! I love the prison and the action where you can gamble for a payout (I forget the name of the building). Just little extra things like that which help this game shine. In addition to the regular "gain resources to buy jewels" there are additional bonus actions and powers that players can gain, and these also really add to the experience. Perhaps this game doesn't feel as innovative as Goa, but it's a tight, solid game and certainly one of Dorn's best.

With the right group of evenly matched players Istanbul can be a captivating and tense battle of wits. But I fear that it is often the case that most of your decisions are made before you actually start playing.

Lighter fair as expected but nicely themed and good components.  Somewhat different strategies allowed.  Fairly unique mechanic which rewards optimization.  Special play of tiles/cards/encounters help to liven up gameplay.  Fun and quick.  Easy to teach and play.  Nice addition!

Very good game with 2 or 3 players. Barely OK with 4 when the outcome is often decided by the roll of a die or someone screwing you before you can take the exact action you just needed. I cannot imagine playing this with five.
Otherwise, very fun and replayable.

#PickUupAndDeliver

Last played with 5 players and got blocked everytime. With 3 players it was ok. But it gets repetitive very quick. If you're out of luck in dice rolling, you will lose. And don't think too much about your move, it's not a very strategic game. The one that thought the most last play ended up last place...

RATING: 7.8
We warmed up the gaming day with Istanbul, the Spiel des Jahres winning from 2014. Playing it, it isn't surprising, its a solid and clever design that is elegant with a veneer of complexity that isn't too deep as to scare away families. I like the trend of Euros with better and more interesting themes and this one is dripping with it more than usually. The theme masks all the abstract mechanisms well, I still found myself wondering how you swap fruits for rubies and how to do it in real life. But it made sense that you wheelbarrow around the city with assistants to do stuff for you. I enjoy the spatial elements of traversing the city and its one of my favorite race games. And a race it is.

RATING: 8
Nice optimisation game, racing to be the first to 5 gems.  Not too taxing, with enough interaction between the players to avoid everyone just concentrating on their own plans.  I like it, but is not in same league as 7 Wonders re kSDJ.

RATING: 9
Part pick-up-and-deliver, part worker placement, completely enjoyable. There's mild competition in a 2-player so one focuses on his or her own agenda. I'm okay with this because there's always something fun to do. Almost zero AP and the game flows like water. Nice art, too. This rating may change to a 10 is replayability is as good as it should seem.

Two plays so far, using the short paths board.  First time was with three, and while fine, lacked enough competition for resources.  With four, though, it shone, with a very close finish.

The modular board is a great idea, and the trader stack from Genoa is cleverly used.

On the short paths board set up we found the mosques little used; this may be inexperience or simply the fact they were far away from the main gem spaces.

Look forward to playing this a lot.  In terms of weight I'd say it around Settler in its complexity and thus fills a useful 45 mins in any session.

Rating based on one play. The kind of medium/heavy weight Euro game that BGGers seem to love. Reminded me a little bit of [thing=9440][/thing] in that rather than going for points the winner is simply the first person to get 5 gems (7 palaces in Maharaja), which gives it a bit of a "no such thing as second place" feel I'm not sure I like.

But the thing that really bugged me was that in our game we were all at four gems and the game became about making moves to prevent someone from winning on that turn rather than trying to win yourself, until someone happened to be lucky enough to be beyond catching. If that turns out to be a common problem with this game, my rating would go down another point.

I like the art and theme very much. Pick up and deliver and quite short distance you can travel at one turn makes much more strategy in game as it seems. It is possible to plan more than one, two turns again and could be rewarded well. And timing is extremely important, because the game is race for five rubies.

Opinion: interesting movement mechanic, as your merchant cannot do anything alone. You have to plan your strategy to leave the assistants on places you can reach on a second trip and do not waste actions. I found it quite easy, not hard to find a good way to get your gems and go for them very rapidly without any opposition. Probably the costs you have to pay are very low making a non tense game

A very strong design, with finely tuned mechanisms. The tradeoffs of executing a useful action, setting up for movement across the board, and benefits from encounters is very well done. In particular, I like the scope of the 4x4 board, with the max movement of 2 spaces. It creates a very interesting dynamic in accordance with the layout of the particular actions. The addition of family members, with the immediate upside to you plus the potential risk if caught by another player, is inspired.

I also appreciate the generally positive nature of the design. For example, it would have been very easy for the Governor and Smuggler mechanisms to have been more "screw you", for example, blocking access to a location rather than presenting an (optional) opportunity with what feels like a very reasonable cost.

Finally, the fact that you don't have to worry too much about the other players and can generally focus on your own strategy, knowing that there may just be some additional marginal cost due to the others, is a great strength, especially for newer players.

Overall, the game is just very well done, and certainly deserves the accolades it received.

The Designer picked up an idea from one of his earlier games (Louis IVX) concerning workerplacement, made a variant and added the usual stuff like collecting resources to turn them into victory points aka Rubies.
A solid design, nice components, however it did not feel as fresh as I hoped. Also it is low on interaction, you don't care that much what others do unless they occupy a space you want to go to but want also save the two money you would had to pay. At the heart of the game, it's an abstract one: you optimize paths on a 4x4 grid. Theme is exchangeable, you could be as well be collecting buckets full of water to extinguish a fire. That's all - ok game but not impressive. Maybe I played too many games yet...

There's a deadly boring optimization puzzle hiding (well, not even really hiding) at the core of this game, but the small ways it nudges your optimization plan off-balance (penalties from meeting opponents and the random bonuses on cards) result in a tasty meal.

Can suffer from the race game problem of a winner being determined several turns before the end, so, maybe not a good game to play with people who respond badly to feeling helpless in that particular way.

A typical modern Euro in that it's kind of worker placement with multiple paths to victory and the game consists of turning this into that into VPs. Unusually, I actually enjoyed it. It has that same "solvable puzzle" aspect to it, but there's just enough player interaction to keep you from being able to ignore your opponents. I have no strong desire to play it again, but I wouldn't turn down the opportunity.

Resource conversion game with an odd way of action selection. Moving over a grid of locations, each allowing a different action, reminded a bit of "Royal Palace". However, you are limited not only by distance, but also by the discs that you drop and pick up again along the way. This, unfortunately, rewards repeating actions instead of variety. The game is a totally abstract race to acquire five rubies using a few different methods, but all involve buying upgrades or the rubies themselves with goods or money. Everything works, but two actions unnecessarily rely on dice rolls and I felt that luck can be decisive.

Easy to see why this one was kennerspiel winner. Not as brain burning as concordia, beautiful to look at, players get rewarded early in the game, plays fast (minimal downtime and VERY reasonable game length), variable board set up, and dice in a euro that get to be just dice! (They are rolled for results and don't get "placed" anywhere.)

No concerns whatsoever with 2p game. One reviewer suggested there may be a problem with it (first wondering if it was a balance issue, then conceding that balance was ok but the 2p game lacked variety due to strength of one of the tiles.) The 2p game is both a balanced and varied RACE with as much to offer at higher player counts.

This game seems like a cross between Blue Moon City (because of the 1-2 space orthogonal movement and the "5 rubies to win" rule) and a worker placement/resource collection game like Agricola.  

I liked it a lot on my first play, and would like to play it more.  It's interesting that I like it, because I usually dislike games that use dice, but this game doesn't hinge too much on the dice rolls -- they're just a way to add some randomness.

With 5 players, there is a good amount of fun competition for certain actions on the board, so you might have to pay 2 coins to other players (per Merchant present in that place!) to get your desired action.  The Mosque tiles are limited to 4, so not all of the 5 players can get each one.

The original short-hop layout can lead to a quick game, since players can jump back and forth between, say, the warehouses and the mosque squares, or the money-generating squares and the Wainwright or the place where you can buy rubies.  If you have more time and are familiar with the game, it's probably better to use one of the longer layouts, or even a random layout.

Tactic to remember: play a $5 card, then move to the Caravansery on the same turn and take it back from the top of the discard pile.

Another tactic to remember, like in worker-placement games: see what other players want, and go there just before they do, to mess up their plans, either by making them pay you $2 for taking the same action, or by taking the Market tile that they were expecting to fulfill.

While I don't think that this is Rudiger's best outing, I do think that this is a strong offering. Overall, this game is Dorn's trailing tower mechanic but now applied to a light economic worker placement. Resources and money are converted back and forth to meet particular conditions or buy-outs which earn you rubies. First to 5 rubies (or 6 in a two player game) wins. To me, this feels like a crossover between Jambo and his former trailing tower games (i.e., Louis XIV, Traders of Genoa, Goa). Good game, but unfortunately not a stand out either in an ever growing sea of resource-conversion worker-placement games.

Woahh! First of all this game looks really cool. At the start of the rules explanation i felt like huhh there will be so much going on but after the first turn i knew what strategy i would like to follow on. The rules are easy to teach, but there are a lot of way to achieve victory. The modular board gives extra replayability and a new vision for a winning strategy. I like the concept and i believe it has a great price / value. A very solid game after one play.
After two games i say that it is broken. There is a strategy which always win the game no matter what the other players are doing.

Pros:
-Easy to teach, clear rules.
-Very good artwork and theme.
-Great price / value with great replayability.

RATING: 9
Great racing game, enhanced by its first and second expansions. [-]Haven't tried the second expansion yet, but somehow feel that it might bloat the game a bit.[/-]


It is a fun race, with equal parts strategy and tactics on a variable player board. There are 'light blocks', where opponents have to pay a monetary penalty to the blocker instead of completely blocking out a space. 


The components are excellent: cheerful graphics with solid wooden playing pieces - a far cry from overproduced plastic sculpts and somehow so much more satisfying to the touch.


Update: With both expansions, the Grand Bazaar, this game is a 10, through and through. I have played multiple nights through with only 2 players, something I normally shy away from. It is engaging and the race feels tight, throughout.


Having tried both major expansions, I would never revert to a game without them. Highly recommended!

A weird game. It's okay and has strategy, I would've liked a little more to chew on though. I didn't feel like I had too few assistants as often as I thought I would. I did have to use the fountain though (and maybe that means I'm not very good at the game). Like I said, it's okay, but I don't think I need to own it. Made me very interested in Traders of Genoa though

Lots of different strategies to win. You can try resource management, card play, upgrading and even gambling or a combination of all of them. Plays differently every time. Interaction comes about with the other players and the governor and smuggler pieces always altering your tactics. Above all its easy to teach and looks great for new players and also plays fairly quickly. Great.

JEM 17. szám: http://jemmagazin.hu/magazin/page/2/

Rüdigern Dorn egy újabb nagyszerű játékot alkotott. Isztambul bazárnegyedében mászkálva, kereskedve szert kell tennünk 5 vagy 6 rubinra. Akinek ez sikerül,megnyeri a játékot. Kereskedőként nem kell egyedül tologatnunk a talicskánkat, rendelkezésünkre áll 4 segéd is, akik segítségével kihasználhatjuk a különböző helyszínek adta lehetőségeket. Kis csapatunk együtt indul, a kereskedőt és a segédeket ábrázoló korongok egy tornyot képeznek. Hasonlóan a Genova játékához. 
A játéktáblát 16 helyszínt ábrázoló lapka alkotja
4×4-es elrendezésben, ezeken mozoghatunk a csapatunkkal.
Egy körben legfeljebb két lépést tehetünk az oldalszomszédos lapokra lépve. Ha egy új helyszínre érkezünk, vagy ott kell hagynunk egy segédet, vagy ha már van ott egy, akkor ő ismét csatlakozik kis csapatunkhoz. Ez szükséges ahhoz, hogy végrehajthassuk a helyszín egyedi akcióját.

Nekem a játék kipróbálás után azonnal megtetszett és tudtam, hogy kell egy ilyen a polcomra. Nagyon tetszik benne, hogy több út vezet a győzelemhez, miután a rubinokat több helyen is meg lehet szerezni.

I was not expecting to like this but I'm a big fan of the victory conditions like '5 rubies wins'.  I also like a bit of luck/randomness in games & I think it works great here.

The only thing that lets it down is the limited player interaction but I'm quite tempted to acquire this game & see if there's a bit more subtlety to the interaction.  That being said I think I would always choose to play Goa instead of this so I'm wondering if I really need it.

An interesting little trading game with a simple goal: acquire 5 rubies. The Gemstone Dealer is perhaps the easiest place to do this, so make sure that groupthink makes this a contested space, don't let one player monopolise and so get an easy victory. A sad reminder of how good Euros used to be before Kickstarter came along.

RATING: 8
It reminded me oddly of Merchant of Venus because what you're really trying to do is find the best loop in which you can get the things you need and take them to where you need them to be.  Expanding your carrier spaces is what makes the game tricky.  It's also pretty and full of rubies. (1 play)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
IMO, others rating the game after only one play, 2-player only, or only using the "short" setup aren't giving it a fair shake.  The "short" setup is intended to be introductory and players naturally tend to fall into specific strategy/paths. IMO, the short set up indeed becomes boring.

Playing a random board tends to lead to more challenging decisions, and subtle interactions.  It will likely still annoy those who don't appreciate games that might come down to a die roll.  Otherwise, it's a solid mid-light/gateway game.

Two parts of the game are really enjoyable:
(1) Most of the functions of the 16 places are just a  getting/spending resources, but some of them still create fun dynamics. I especially enjoy Tea House.
(2) I admire the family member/governor/smuggler design, which really makes the game shine along with the modular boards.

The one-by-one-ruby-collecting race is a straightforward design, making the heuristic evaluation very clear(i.e. game space is clear & approachable), but also create nothing very surprising & exciting. I appreciate this target-audience based design choice(i.e. family oriented), in spite that it's slightly not my taste. I prefer something more intense.

So it has some very interesting but small dynamics, which are good enough for me to enjoy the game. But lacking some overall climax refrains it from being great.

Loved this when it came out, but after a few plays it felt a bit boring.  It becomes a game of try to identify the best route to victory at the start and exploit it.

Great worker placement game with impressively high production value.  The board has beautiful, well illustrated scenes.  Istanbul has well designed movement mechanics with the merchants and their assistants.  There is very little player interaction: when you land on an area with another player's merchant, you must pay 2 lira.  I had a blast playing this game and it was so much fun that we played it twice in the same day.  There are multiple paths to victory.  A huge plus is the way the board is divided into 16 separate rectangular bazaar areas and can be re-arranged differently for each play.  The game's replay value would be much lower with a static board.  The game was exceedingly fun with 4 and 5 players.  I imagine that the game would not be quite as much fun with 2 or 3 players. This game is light enough to introduce to non-gamers, yet it is interesting and not boring and fun.

A very beautiful and enjoyable game concerning the pursuit of gemstones.  I love the modular board and the movement of the player pieces, you are simultaneously trying to calculate the move efficient route around the market stands you want to visit and trying to avoid the other players pieces as activating a market while someone else is there will cost extra.  I also liked the player powers that can be bought and there seemed to be multiple routes to victory.  Highly recommended.

Enjoyable game with a nice mechanic of movement and "Worker placement" where you move your merchant around and either leave an assistant to carry out an action, or pick one up that has carried out the action.

Plays in around 1.5 - 2 hours depending on new players.

Relatively straight forward to learn and has multiple paths to victory, also allows for some interactions to hinder other players and allow you to win, but not too aggressive.

The theme of Istanbul doesn't really grab me and the game is not as interesting as the much earlier Rüdiger Dorn games Traders of Genoa and Goa. However, Istanbul delivers a lot of game play in a relatively short time. There are two or three main strategies available and a lot of tension over tactical decisions due to competition between the players for locations. In addition, the random set up provides a fair amount of variety from play to play. With the Mocha & Baksheesh expansion my rating rises to a 9 due to the increase in the available strategies.

Those who think Euro games are all about "efficient engine building" (soulless devils, each one of them) miss out the fun that playing this optimising game provides with just enough ability to at least irritate if not thwart other players as you play your own game. 

Various set-ups, including random layouts (not my favourite!) ensure replayabality.

Not going to tax your brain, but is beautifully produced and playable by non gamers and those who are not "zero sum, efficiency"  machines or those who need lots of theme to have a game be fun/interesting.  Recommended.

Prijs 2014. Variabel speelbord met 16 locaties; spelers bewegen hun handelaar met vier helpers om op een locatie acties uit te voeren. Koopwaar kan je zo krijgen (hoe groter je handkar, hoe meer je krijgt) en vervolgens ofwel verkopen op de markt voor geld, ofwel ruilen bij de sultan voor robijnen, ofwel gebruiken om andere acties mogelijk te maken (vb. in de moskee). Met geld kan je voordelen kopen (vb. bij smokkelaar of gouverneur) of robijnen kopen bij de juwelier. Wie het eerst 5 (of 6 bij 2 spelers) robijnen heeft, beëindigd het spel. Tof mechanisme, allicht steeds anders; worker placement waarbij je goed moet nadenken over de route die je volgt. Zeer fijn spel.

Nice enough little race game. It seems like the strategy is going to be mostly decided by the board layout, where if you can find a few actions fairly nearby to each other that work well together and just do those it should be strong. I was hoping that the putting down/picking up discs thing would make things more interesting but it mostly just forces you to do the same actions over and over again if you don't want to be constantly wasting actions going to the fountain. It felt like this made the game more restrictive rather than generating more interesting decisions.

Most great euros end just after you've built an engine and had a chance to use it for a short amount of time (the trick being to figure out when to make the switch from engine building to going full out into victory points). 

The engine building in this game is a red herring, the game doesn't last long enough. Instead it's a case of analysing the setup and figuring out in what order to efficiently make a rush for gems.

Even splendor has engine building and that's a quicker game than this.

Istanbul has very, very, very smooth mechanisms, well represented theme, and good replay value with a modular game board.  That being said, there is little player interaction.  In fact, most often the players spend their time trying to avoid each other.  With everyone focused on their own path across the board, our games had long periods of silence ("Your turn..." "Ok, your turn..."), which I don't consider too fun.  If further proof is needed, the solo variant of the game is exactly the same as the multi-player version.  

This is all a long way of saying, Istanbul is a min-max game.  If you enjoy being able to optimize routes in specific numbers of actions, then Istanbul may be for you.  Otherwise, for as beautiful as the mechanisms are, I traded this game away to get something more social, more interactive.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2014)

As the Kennerspiel des Jahres winner I was expecting a much better game. It is gorgeous but after your first turn every move is painfully obvious (you can only move 2 spaces), also the downtime with 5 players is brutal as you can´t plan anything on other player’s turns. To add insult to injury, the diamonds (blue goods) and the cards are totally luck driven with almost no way to mitigate them. In my game the player who deserved victory lost because he rolled a 3 and the player who won did so because he rolled a 7+ AND had a card that let him use the Sultan place twice.

Great art and bits. I think its sweet spot is with 3 players, will try it this way sometime in the future. Boring theme for me.

Bottom line, it is a very simple game that didn’t live to its expectation, it has no tension nor interesting decisions. I think it can be a great family game but it was very boring for me. Lots of downtime and I feel luck decides the winner of the game as most decisions are obvious.

Played it several times with my wife and 6 or 7 times with the game group, playing it with all player counts. This game has been a huge hit with everyone who has played it. It plays well with all player counts though with the two player variant the placement of the dummy merchants is somewhat limited. It is easy to explain and can be won with a variety of strategies. The games are usually tight and right after the game people are always saying "if only" and "I could have finished up in 'n' moves". Very fun, not prone to AP, just a terrific game.

I ordered this game because I've always been a fan of Dorn's designs.  When it won the Kennerspiel des Jahres, that was icing on the cake... however, it won't pass Louis XIV as my favourite Dorn design.  

Istanbul is basically a race game.  The first person to gain 5 rubies is the winner.  How you gain those rubies is the core of what is basically a worker placement game with a few twists.

There are lots of hard decisions to be made each turn, and with only 16 places to move to, player interaction is constant.  The luck of the dice for special movement is just enough randomness to add to my enjoyment of the game.

The game isn't as complex as I thought upon first read of the rules, but there are lots of decisions to be made each turn.  My only complaint (which is true of most games with a lot of choices) is that if you tend to play with people who have AP, add 60-90 minutes to the listed play time.  This is way past my optimal play time.  Because of this, I'm only going to give the game a 7.

Unique mechanics, plenty of variety once you start rearranging the board, enough thought to keep me engaged.  Down-side is if there's an obvious "win route" it turns into a simple race game which is not a favorite of mine.

2016-02-09 - First impression: Istanbul is a fast playing, sort-of pick up and deliver game. The rules are simple, and the game is fun. Not sure how the replayability will end up being, but I'm looking forward to exploring it more.

2017-02-03 - I've played this several more times, and it has held up really well. It's easy to teach, and great for new people, but even better with experienced players. The variable set up has helped a lot with replayability. I've purchased the first expansion but haven't tried it yet.

Great game with what seems like a lot of options to explore.  Random setup should give a good bit of replay ability.

The expansion is also a nice addition with new options to consider!

Setup is a bit of a pain, but the game plays so quickly and smoothly that you could really play this one back-to-back in under 2 hours if inclined to do so. It's decent enough at 2-players, but it's really best with 4.

Not nearly as tight as some of Dorn's other breadcrumbs games, but much more accessible. While efficiency of actions is still the objective, there are enough elements of chance here that mistakes are not ultimately as damaging. Your strategy will largely focus on the board set-up and leveraging your movement effectively. Other players can get in the way a bit, but it is almost always by chance. Light and enjoyable, but don't expect much depth.

What I like most about this game is that my 12-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter both enjoy it and can play it competitively. It's probably the most advanced game I've played with my daughter and that's exciting. I'll hold onto it until they lose interest. As for playing with adults, I think the interest is already gone.

OK game but not one I will ordinarily suggest but will play if others insist.  Frankly, with the recent release of Yokohama, I don't see this game getting as much play as most of my group see Yokohama as a meatier version of Istanbul with more paths to victory, not necessarily a negative on Istanbul but the fact that Yokohama has more strategic depth without a ton more complexity.

This has an interesting mechanic of moving around two moves per turn with various helpers that you drop off on the tile where you stop to take an action. You can also pick them up if you visit the space again to take the action again. This leads to trying to find a cycle between tiles in a region. You can also recollect them at one tile. There are some interesting bonus cards which adds to the gameplay. There are two tiles which require dice rolls. This does add some potentially annoying randomness. You gather resources and money and can use both to buy gems which you need to win. I would play it a few more times, but don't see it as becoming a favorite.

I grew warm to this game with more plays stretched over a longer time period after having to play it repeatedly when training for the German boardgame championship. Given the short playtime and comparably easy rules, the luck involved and the imbalance between the methods of getting gems (money is the way to go) is ok.
---
My problem with this game can be traced down to the blue goods and the way to acquire them which is mostly luck-based. Roll high in the black market, run across the smuggler, get the right special card. In one game, I was able to collect the five rubies in only 14 rounds as I got really lucky with rolling high in the black market and delivering in the neighbouring great mosque. The other players all had between one and three rubies.
--- 
In principle, Istanbul is a very simple game. Move one or two steps with your meeple stack, perform an action, done. Where's the beef? Hidden in the 16 different locations players can move to. Hidden is a standard resource collection and conversion game with some engine building. The winner is the player acting most efficiently, i.e. the first to collect five rubies.
I like the very short moves coupled with a decent amount of depth. There's some strategy but tactical considerations are as important. In the end, Istanbul suffers from a lack of innovation. I already couldn't warm to Dorn's coupling of strategic engine building with tactical optimization in Goa and I feel similarly here although it's a completely different game in every other respect.

RATING: 7
This is a great game that I like a ton. I love how you focus on a short term objective, sometimes have to stray away from it for a bit, plan 3-4 moves in advance, but also need a plan B. It's the right balance between planning and screwing up others' plans. I like the multiple paths to victory, and the multiple mini mechanisms: the tea house, the carriage, the markets... The expansion also adds a lot of really interesting stuff, with Guild cards (super powerful, but cost an action), and of course, the coffee resource.

Favorite mechanism: Meetings. The two "NPCs" which give you a bonus if you land on them play a big part in forcing you to adapt, which makes this a much more dynamic game.

This is a strange game when you first teach people. They understand the fact that you drop workers to do an action but they get confused when you tell them that you do the action when they return to their assistants. After a couple of turns they get the notion of you want to go to somewhere but if you won't return there you are not playing in the most efficient way. When they understand they need to find chains to get rubies they really enjoy the game. Every turn matters and you can't waste an action. Some people like to get their cart built and some just go after upgrades before people snag them. I have played many strategies in this and it is still so fresh. You can win by not building up your cart, you can win by ignoring special abilities, you create a lot of distinct strategies and the game rewards that. I love this game so much!

2017-02-18 - 6 - Fine, quick, simple euro. It lacked some kind of excitement for me or this feeling of "what a clever move I just made", but it works very smoothly and I could play it on almost every occasion. I played with 3 players and it could be better with four as the board would be more crowded, not allowing to do everything you would like to.

The box does not lie about the length of this game, actually I think we finished in less than 40 minutes, which is great. Light family game with some optimization with the paths you take. Enjoyed more than I though I would. However, the luck involved can be very swingy, because you can get triple the number of resources based on a single die roll. Also, I think that the first player has advantage, even with the extra coins to the other players.

Pros: It's good. The turns are quick and you have enough choices to keep it interesting but the choices are limited on any given turn such that the average person won't get AP. Nice variable setup keeps it fresh, and excellent artwork definitely adds to the experience.

Cons: Setup takes a long time.

I've enjoyed my couple of plays of this, but I don't feel like I should have. Once the board is set up, there is little randomness, so if you like games with an element of chance, this may not be for you. It seems like a good player could study the board setup at the beginning and basically plan out the whole game.

It's not quite as bad as that, as other players' actions can impact your plans and necessitate course corrections, plus there is a little randomness in dice rolls and card draws.

One element of the mechanics also seems like it should be a big drawback. You have to either drop off or pick up an underling when you move, so if you keep going to new places, you'll run out of minions and start losing time. The greatest efficiency is  to go back and forth over the same ground, so you keep picking up dudes you'd previously dropped off.

Again, in my couple of plays, it wasn't nearly as bad as it sounded, though I expect there are board setups where that would really be an issue.

Confusing at first due to all the options, but it is a fun race game once you learn it.

Includes the Expansions:
Istanbul: Mocha & Baksheesh (2015)
Istanbul: Letters & Seals (2016)
Istanbul: Pegasus Depot Mini Expansion (2016)

Istanbul, together with the Mocha and Baksheesh expansion, is much better than the base game. The expansion expands the map and offers two new options for gaining rubies. It also adds Guild Cards, which are worth giving up an entire turn in order to play.

The game forces you to think several turns ahead, and even offers you the possibility that your plans will pan out. However, there are many opportunities for your opponents to subtly thwart your plans.

This is one medium weight Eurogame that I have enjoyed quite a bit. In most games, though, there has been a runaway leader who simply couldn't be stopped. That could be a problem.

Play the cube-pushing euro style or even go full luck with the dice rolling to hope for a bigger payoff. A lot of different types of players can get involved in this one. loved it.

Somehow the game reminds me a little of checkers. It can be enjoyed by players of various levels - both newbies & experienced IMO. Play time is within an hour once you learn it; price is reasonable; components are nice.

The game tends to end with ties so tie breaker is important. Hopefully its expansion "Mocha & Baksheesh" will give more variety.

Serious gamers probably won't care too much about the game. I like it 'cause it's simple & fun, but I probably won't play it every week.

Rüdiger Dorn does it again with another great euro game. This one has similar movement to Genoa, but it does a better job of using the mechanic, in this case an economic builder with a great and highly replayable modular board. Another refreshing thing about this game is that it is a race to five rubies, instead of an accumulation of victory points. This rating will probably go up with more plays.

I usually like Rudiger Dorn's games, but Istanbul didn't really grab me. The reason for this is that unlike most Dorn's designs Istanbul doesn't really have a lot of player interaction. Sometimes another player happens in to be in the square you're moving into or another players grabs something you were going to get - and that's about it. Other than that Istanbul is a fairly solitair-ish race in efficiency and while it works just fine, it's not a particularly interesting. Excellent art and usability.

It is one of the few euro games that I am willing to play every now and then.

And that is because of the nice artwork and the nice theme and the components that work well with the theme.

I also like the mechanics in it and I managed to win it against heavy Euro Gamers that play euro games every week. 

This means that even someone like me, who is not that good in building engines and spread sheets can win this one. In other euro games you don't have a single chance against players who studied all the engines and the spread sheets of a game, and who will simply destroy you (having 50-100 points more than you at the end of the game)...

Istanbul is the kennersspiel des jahres winner 2014. 
I would be okay it with it winning game of the year as it is fairly light and takes 45 minutes to play.

There are some problems with Istanbul for me and the main problem is that the end requirement (gain 5 rubies, or 6 in a 2P game) is pretty easy to accomplish by all player at the same time. At which tie breaker rules applies.
The tiebreaker rules are pretty odd too. first the money than than the goods and than bonus cards.
I would have preferred a sum of those and probably rubies at 50 + Money + goods time three + bonus cards time two. In case of a tie than the most money, than goods and than possible bonus cards.
Anyway that is besides the point. the point is that with the current victory conditions it boils down to whom has the most money in a lot of cases and for me I think it is a flaw.

I kind of hoped to see more interesting game here (because of the KdJ title) than it actually was. Dorn has made couple of interesting games, but more lately games which I haven't liked that much and this goes to the later group. Istanbul is a bit too much solo puzzle than the competitive game AND the gameflow is a bit too slow for my taste. Sure, this is a game which I'm ready to play again although I'm not the one who suggest it it. The kebab expansion doesn't change the game that much and the quality of the expansion is... well... nicely said: cheap.

Rüdiger Dorn walked a long road to reach 'Kennerspiel des Jahres' status. After more than a decade of Spiel des Jahres and Kennerspiel des Jahres nominations, Rüdiger Dorn got this award for Istanbul which is once again a game he built on a mancala/breadcrumbs mechanism (like in most of his earlier designs). Here he managed making it just as entertaining for "knowing non-gamers" (Kenner - the people who aren't gamers but have already played a few gateways) as it is for gamers, and I guess this feat could not have been accomplished, had he not spent many years designing solely family games a few years ago. So here it is, a race for points, a relatively low complexity mechanism combined with 16 different action spaces, a very good one.

Rüdiger Dorn "GOA" is a fantastic game , one of my favorites.
"ISTANBUL" didn't impress me at all so far.
1 play, 3 players rating 6.5
It is a light game with very low interaction.
Just when it really begins it's already over.
Reguires more plays to enjoy.
I'd definitely recommend trying before buying.

2nd play , 5 players 
much, much better so now I even want to buy it.
Comment after 1 play is always dangerous.

It's an average eurogame where you move around to gather resources and sell them to acquire gems.

There could be a dominant strategy with the tea house and the jeweller as explained in a thread.

The movement is a bit odd and upgrading the size of your cart is fun. But there is not much more to this game.

It's still light and short, so accessible to any kind of people.

RATING: 6
Starting to tire of this game after 10 plays as it starts to feel quite samey even with changing up the "board".  Still a clever game that can play in an hour, I just don't get excited about it any more.  I've dropped my rating from an 8 to a 7 and wouldn't be surprised if I end up selling this one.  Everyone around me has a copy anyway. Dropped it to a 6 as I can play if others wish, but I won't suggest the game.  Sold my copy.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I didn't think this was one that I would really consider acquiring, but after my first play I must admit that I really like this one.  The random board setup likely helps as I would otherwise be somewhat suspicious that people would fall into certain paths and the game would start feeling a bit scripted.  Plays quickly, rules are fairly simple, and is a bit of a race game in that the winner is the first person to acquire a certain number of gems, of which there are five places and ways one may do so.  

The mechanic of taking your 3-4 assistants and dropping one off each place you visit and then having to ideally retrace your steps or less ideally, return to home court to regather everyone is interesting and provides an interesting puzzle to work through.  Outside of having to pay $2 when you visit a space with someone else's merchant, there is very little interaction or take that.

I really liked how "clear" the game is: everything is on the board (or on the small cheat sheet). I really liked the race element created by the small number of points needed for winning (instead of a point salad,…). I liked how going into a specific zone defines part of the tactics *for a "round"*, i.e. until the next meeting at the Fountain: this gives variety. I probably would like the strategies offered by different setups. I also like the relatively legible market for gems, where one can guess the cost in lira of goods. I also like the bonuses: it is always nice to get something sweet, and it spurs me when an opponent gets something nice: I want to run fast and win the race anyway. I liked that the game is not so long (1 small hour?). I liked the fast turns.

The game in itself does not have so much theme (but there is some effort made).

Overall, this is a relatively simple but interesting euro, with builtin, in-game and between-game variety. Nothing earth-shattering, but a solid, enjoyable, "clear" (not complexified) game.

Zu dritt würde ich aufgrund der Anzahl Felder lieber nur mit dem Grundspiel spielen, aber zu viert oder zu fünft mit der großen Bazaar Variante (beide Erweiterungen).
Es gibt dabei so viele Möglichkeiten was es Sinnvolles zu tun gibt, dass man gut Planen muss. Mir hat auch sehr der zusätzliche Arbeiter gefallen, da man mit ihm das gleiche Feld nochmals aktivieren kann und noch besser ihn in der anderen Ecke des Feldes laufen lassen kann und so Züge noch besser kombinierbar machen kann.
Die Mokka&Bakschisch Erweiterung trägt nun ebenfalls mehr, da man die Plättchen vom Kaffeestand sehr gebrauchen kann um mit den NPCs zu interagieren (von denen es jetzt 4 Stück sind) und nochmehr von dem Zugweite-Plättchen profitiert, da das Brett ja wirklich sehr groß ist.
Was mich sehr gestört hat ist, dass die Felder und die Karten auf 3 Anleitungen verteils erklärt werden. Das ist aber ein Manko, das ich umgehen kann, indem ich einfach selbst Übersichtsblätter erstelle.
Ich hätte echt nicht gedacht, dass mir Istanbul mit so vielem so gut gefällt, aber ausser 2-3 Regeln und einfach mehr Felder kommt ja wirklich nicht dazu.
Eine Erweiterung allein würde ich allerdings nicht mehr spielen. Beide zusammen oder das Grundspiel allein.
Auch der Kebab Shop und der Karanwanenführer Promo sind echt gut integriert und kein nutzloses Beiwerk.

It's weird how much I like this game considering how ultimately abstract it is and the lack of direct player interaction.  Don't get me wrong, there is player interaction there, and it's important, but less then I usually like.  Maybe it's because I'm pretty good at it, maybe because the stress of the race aspect of it, I don't know, but I love the puzzle of it.

There aren't many medium-light pick up and deliver games out there, and Istanbul differentiates itself further with its assistants mechanism that shifts the balance from trying to move as little as possible while doing the same quality of actions, to which actions do I not mind doing multiple times? I don't think I'll want to play it frequently, as while the map is modular I think the game will give a similar feel each time, but it definitely is a very cleanly designed game of its genre without being overly light.

Although I may see why other players like this game, it is just probably not my type of board games. I don't see enough replayability, I would say. Once you figure out the path that leads you to the victory, that's it - you will almost always win. My wife on the other hand likes it very much.

I'm impressed. I didn't think they made traditional Euros any more, much less ones that while being point salad, still has a wonderful feel and variety. I think the latter is because the game is more of efficiency and a bit of a race to 5 total points/rubies, so it doesn't feel quite like you're churning an engine.

I'll be curious to see what the expansion adds. I'm guessing it won't be an evolution, but the same tweaks Dorn likes to make to his games.

Yet another Rüdiger Dorn let's-trace-a-path game.  This one has some interesting meat to it.  The completely random board setup precludes solving the game quickly, and the penalty for co-occupation kinda forces everyone into different strategies naturally (although at some point, those strategies have to converge to a degree).  This means that every game tends to be fresh.  However, games can still run a little long if the players are even slightly AP prone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a smooth game - it plays quickly, it isn't hard to teach or learn, and it is very deep. It is a worker placement, but with some area movement and control - you can move only up to two spaces per turn on a 4x4 grid, so you will have greater or fewer choices depending on where you traveled last turn. Each time you move somewhere, you leave someone behind that you will have to later pick back up (or rest at the fountain to get them all back at once), and if you're visiting a place someone else wants to, they have to pay you for that privilege.

The replayability of this game is exquisite without an insane amount of setup. Each game can be laid out randomly or pre-selected based on the type and kinds of interactions you want, creating games that are different. Since this is a collect and spend kind of game, if the spaces that you need to collect resources are far away from the places you need to spend them, you'll have a lot of people treading on each other and trying to make the best of their long journeys (hopefully encouraging good-natured table-talk). If you have the opposite, then people will separate into their areas and then travel somewhere else when they're done, leaving the previous area behind forever, creating a different kind of game altogether.

The abilities and the cards you can get during the game add a feel of unique powers - each player will probably end up with different abilities, allowing some to move further, others to travel longer between rests, collecting resources more effectively, or cheat on their gambling for better returns. If you're paying attention, the differences become apparent; players will use their signature ability often and will be the only one doing that kind of thing (until someone else manages to collect the same, now-increased-price ability.

This game deserves all the praise it gets. Although each tile does something different, it's not too hard to figure out and everything is clear after a couple of plays.

The game involves some planning, but the choice usually is between just a couple of optimal moves, so AP should be limited. The board will become quite chaotic (in fact mimicking the hustle and bustle in a real bazaar), leading to some player interaction without any hard take that being involved.

It is probably true that this game can be 'solved', in that experienced players can figure out the optimal paths, even with a custom board lay-out. This is not something the casual gamer will have to worry about though.

1. Many guild cards are super powerful compared with the old 'feather' cards, and both spots give the same benefit (1 coffee + 1 of the 2 cards).
2. AP potential.
A very good game if played with fast players, though.

Understand why this won Kenner Spiel des Jahres - fully deserved. I like games at this weight, but even with the variable setup, there seems to be reoccurring strategies in every game, which is okay, but makes it slightly less replayable after the forst 5 or so plays. Maybe the expansion can add the needed freshness?

one of the higher depth to time games, which is a good thing

simple rules with fun gameplay.  Seems to work well with any number of players.

Its a fun theme that works well enough, but its not as fleshed out as I would hope.  There are a few disconnects but the game is fast enough that it doesnt matter much.  Who are you?  Why is your family member going to jail all the time?  Why rubies?

They could have made this from cards vs cardboard but it makes it better, surprisingly so.
This is one game that feels a little like a phase 2 gateway game, thats a good thing.

Pick up and deliver, done in an compact way. Very clever  design. This is a rather abstract game.
Games that came to mind when playing; [thing=38992][/thing], [thing=119391][/thing], [thing=70512][/thing] and [thing=1345][/thing].

Plays fast and smooth. It's clear that the theme has nothing to do with the game. Neverteheless, visually the game looks very inviting, with lots of bright colors and beautiful drawings. Unfortunately, not for a second do you think about the beautiful city Istanbul, while playing.

The game is very different when the locations are put in a different order. Other strategies will be needed. Since this is really a race to acquire 5 diamonds as fast as you can, every move counts. Having to regroup your assistants at the fountain often, is a waste of time.

I bought this game emotionally, and because i like a lot of [person=381][/person]'s games, I took the risk without knowing too much about the game. But I wasn't disappointed.

Minus: 2 - 6

Comparisons to Blue Moon City are odd, except that it has a random grid.  This is about timing your turns and optimizing your movements to race to that end state.  What's good is that there are a few valid paths to take to try and win, and often games end with losing players a turn or two at most away from winning.

I did not like this game at first because of some unfortunate game set-ups.  Some random layouts simply do not work.  Also, you can build a strategy that falls apart on a bad dice roll.  However, if you get past these flaws, the game is a lot of fun to play.

One look at the box cover, and the theme becomes quite obvious. You take on the role of a merchant in Istanbul, trying to buy and sell goods as quick as possible in order to outmaneuver your competition. This commerce takes place in a local bazaar, somewhere in Istanbul. However, there's a slight twist. Instead of trying to collect the most money (lira), you are attempting to gain the most rubies. The first person to gather at least 5 rubies (6 in a 2-player game) wins! Therefore, at its heart, Istanbul is a racing game. 


Theme: It's not just pasted on; rather, the game incorporates the theme into the mechanics. For example, one of the 16 places you can visit is the tea house. Tea is a mainstay of Turkish culture. The history of Turkish tea consumption/trading is rich and well-documented. Accordingly, a tea house can be found in nearly every bazaar. Since you would not typically buy large quantities of tea at the tea house (this would be conducted at a market), the game uses the tea house for a different purpose. Players go to the tea house in order to gamble. They speculate on dice rolls (there are two d6 dice included in the game). Players pick a number between 3 and 12. If the dice roll is equal to or greater than the number that they preselected, they receive lira in that amount. Not only is this REALLY fun to do, it's also historically relevant. Recently, casinos have been banned throughout Istanbul, forcing gambling to become an underground activity. Not to mention the fact that, throughout history, the pub/tea house/coffee house has always been a forum for trade. So, Istanbul not only blends the mechanics with the theme, but keeps it historically accurate. The tea house is used as a case in point, not as an exception. There could be, perhaps, more information on the Istanbul bazaar included in the game. You see this in games by Martin Wallace and Mac Gerdts. Yet, that should not be an expectation, and the absence of it has no effect on actual gameplay. 

Rating: 9.5 out of 10

Components: I'm a components guy, so I am naturally harsh on games that include mediocre components, and very appreciative of those that include great ones. This game falls into the latter category. The modular board pieces (place tiles) are all made of a thick cardboard stock. On a personal note, I HATE paper in board games. Ideally, the only paper should be the instructions. I'm sure that I am in the minority, but I literally won't buy games, despite their good reputation, based on the fact that they have subpar components (Castles of Burgundy and Goa are good examples here). So, the fact that this game has cardboard player boards (your wheelbarrow) and cardboard player aids (double-sided at that), really adds to the overall quality, IMO. Quality of art, of course, is purely subjective. But to me, the art is absolutely beautiful and really adds to the thematic flavor. The plastic ruby pieces are a nice touch. I'm glad they decided not to go with red cubes. The box is sturdy, maybe not as sturdy as the Z-Man production of Robinson Crusoe, but certainly more sturdy that an Alea box. The other bits are standard euro faire, although the stickers for the merchants are a nice touch. The only thing that was missing for me was stickers for the assistants, and maybe some differentiation by player color. 

Rating: 9 out of 10

Gameplay: The game is super smooth, and has great player interaction (although indirect). The point of the game is to gather as much money and goods as possible. Shocker… Once you collect goods, you sell them for money or rubies and you also can convert money directly into rubies. Those familiarities aside, this game offers something I've never seen before. Instead of taking actions yourself, you drop your workers off to do them for you. You essentially manage a team of workers. However, you have to keep a close eye on them. Since they are buying and selling precious goods, they could, at any point, skim some of your profit. As a result, you can never travel very far in this game. Instead of visiting every place in the bazaar, you are naturally limited by geography. You have to create efficient circuits within the bazaar so that you can get everything accomplished, while also keeping your assistants under constant surveillance. These are circuits, not routes. Throughout the game, you are required to retrieve your workers in order for them to buy and sell more goods, so it's not a one-way affair. This is a genius system. Since money in this game is not particularly tight (you can gain money through gambling, selling goods and through bonus cards), the tightness comes in the form of movement restriction. You are not going to be able to do everything. You simply choose a profitable circuit and go about your business. I strongly suggest that you use the preset board for your first play. This initial round will allow you to easily plan your circuit. In addition to circuit building, this game includes dice rolling, pick-up and deliver, and worker placement. The mechanics blend together quite well, and there are certainly many paths to victory. Most importantly, this game showcases a fundamental truth of eurogames in general: rules don't have to be complicated in order for complex decision to occur. In other words, simple rules should be able to lead to rich and complex decision making.

Enjoyable, with multiple ways to collect the rubies needed to win. Can be rather multi-solitaire and opportunistic. I´m not very good at it, probably because I´m too slow in going for the rubies.

First played at a meetup where we were drafted by a very enthusiastic lady. The game didn't sound all that exciting from general descriptions, but the gameplay is fast and with an easy learning curve. I really love how little downtime there is and that you can choose how much luck (dice) you want to incorporate into your strategy.

It is on the lighter side though.

Easy to pick up, quick to play. Really rewards players who can react and adapt quickly to the board and other players' actions. Feels like a race game and enjoy how tight the game is with very close scoring spread (4 to 6) even between new and experienced players. Potentially gets same-y after a few consecutive games as they are really only 5 places to get gems.

Rating based on two-player games. Played initially with suggested blue setup, which fell completely flat. Strongly recommend you skip and try the green setup, which makes for a more difficult game. Look forward to trying with more players as well as with a random setup.

--------- 

Three-player game was better except that I think play should have continued to six gems as in the two-player game. The "max" cards and post office were clustered with the large market and the card that gives gems for money. I decided to max out my wainwright, snag a 0 move and 2x delivery bonus card, then hammer the aforementioned tiles, but fell a turn or two short of a player who just hammered them from the get go. In retrospect the wainwright may have been too far away to make that a useful strategy.

Excellently designed race to see who can get a certain number of gems before the other players. Worker placement, but instead of removing and placing each turn, you move your main worker around a randomized grid of locations and drop assistants on those spots to take the action there. Smartly balanced game play, easy to learn and with a more strategic feel than you would expect. Plays fast and plays well with any number, including two or five.

This is a neat game where you race to be the first person to gather a set amount of gems. You can do this many different ways, from buying wagon upgrades, ability tiles to trading goods or money for them. You do this by moving a stack of discs across the tiles, dropping off or picking up a disc in order to activate the tile's action.

I really enjoy this game, it has a variable set-up, where you can adjust between a shorter and longer game, and you can also just do a random set-up as well. It works well regardless of player count.

The one play we had was with the recommended short paths setup. A player could bounce between two synergistic tiles the entire game with a moderate chance of winning. Interaction between players is low. I would like to try this again, perhaps with a larger map using an expansion and with a randomized setup.

Prima stimmiges Design und anständiges Material. Der Spielmechanismus an sich funktioniert. Bin noch unsicher wie ausgewogen das Spiel auf Dauer ist. Schöne kurze Downzeiten und der variable Spielplan bringt Abwechslung ins Spiel.

Fazit: Nettes kurzes (30-60 Min) Spiel für zwischendurch.

Very clever action selection scheme at the core of this game. You can move only one or two spaces and you can only take an action if one of your assistants is already there (then you pick him up), or if you have an assistant with you and agree to leave him on the space.

The rest, i.e., picking up goods, upgrading abilities, and trading for victory points (here: gems) is pretty standard. Nevertheless, the action selection part alone makes this a really good game. Also, I do not think that more elaborate actions would make sense, when you can never freely pick them.

Might pick it up as a "replacement" for Puerto Rico, i.e. to play with people that might enjoy a medium weight game without always having to play PR without expansions with them.

Update: Decided that I will not buy or trade for this. Would gladly play again but do not need to own.

What a great gateway game. Always has a positive feel to it, it always feels satisfying to make your system of dropping and recollecting pawns work, even if you don't win. Direct (meeting other tradesmen) and indirect (reaching some market quarter first) player interaction. Little downtime because individual actions are simple.
This has not worn off at all for us, and I keep using it when I have casual and experienced gamers sitting at one table and I need something to satisfy both groups.
Works nicely with every player count, even with 5 players.

KSdJ 2013 nominee by Dorn. Supposed to be light but looks interesting. Noel liked.

Played this 4p. I played more tactically than I expected, though that might just be from inexperience. Thus it did not give me that feeling I was worried about: form a strategy as soon as the cards are dealt and then just execute autoplay the whole game. It was fun and engaging and played fast. I question how replayable it is, but I just might find out.

After three plays with two it is just an ok game for me. Maybe it is better with more players. Unfortunately it is a game which is not very organic.
Update: After a game with Four players I have to admit that is not better. I won't play it again with the short way rules. Also the others disliked the game because everybody plays just in his circle. Not lots of interaction, no story to Tell, no playing value. We are dissapointed of the game so far. Maybe the long way rules are better, but I have my doubts ...

Moduláris tábla, igényes kivitelezés, szórakoztató játékmenet.

Kicsit erősnek érzem érte a KdJ plecsnijét, de kétségkívül nem egy rossz játék. Gamereknek szerintem kevés, könnyedebb darabokhoz szokott játékosoknak meg talán túl sok a bonyolítás benne.

A tematikát jól visszaadja, ahogy Isztambul utcáin seftelgetve kell gyűjtögetni a pénzt/drágaköveket. Éppen a játék megjelenése előtt jártam ott, ráadásul éppen nászúton, úgyhogy szívemhez már csak emiatt is közel áll (a hab a tortán pedig, hogy a feleségemtől ezt kaptam utána születésnapomra).

This didn't blow my mind, as it's pretty much more of the same, but I found it to be quite enjoyable...and very quick! I actually wanted there to be more rounds, as I was just getting into a groove. That's a shocking feeling for me to have with this sort of game. I also like that there seems to be some semblance of strategy here, as the variable board layout might open up different opportunities for your engine each time. The player who can identify a particularly profitable section of tiles could do quite well.

And I have to say I liked it much more than what I was expecting...

I already knew the mechanics from watching the run from Rahdo and like I said, I was curious about it but I wasn't super excited to try it...

The game is simple but it's fun, and with 5 players there's always someone in the way so the interaction between the players happens all the time, it's not cutthroat but there's some there and it makes it fun 

We played with the not basic layout and it seems it makes the game more interesting, from what Dugy said, I can't say because this was my first play, so...

Istanbul is a great-looking game that plays with 3 - 4 players in less than 1 hour:  making it a fantastic lunch game.  Everyone who I've played it with has loved it.  The main idea of the game is action selection by spatial route movement.  The actions themselves are very straightforward which contributes to the fast paced nature of the game.  The game does not give players a sense of teching up, but of just racing for rubies.

Rudiger Dorn is back! :)
This is a very original and interesting twist on worker placement, fast paced and smart game. The principle of moving around your assistants and having to optimize your paths is very original, but still, the very actions offered on the "board" are also kinda different from a typical worker-placement fair.
A lot of player interaction for an almost-euro (indirect interaction, but you still screw them by using some action before them, so it makes the action more expensive for them... and they need to pay you, if they meet you on the same card), lot of replayability thanks to modular board. Thumbs up and fingers crossed for Spiel des Jahres.

UPDATE: And yes, it won! Kennerspiel des 2014.

Before playing, I was concerned that the game would feel too similar to Ghost Stories -- which we already own -- due to the main mechanic of moving around on a grid of tiles, then taking an action on the tiles. The good news is that the games didn't feel similar.

In fact, the word I'd use to describe Istanbul is pleasant. Not too heavy, not too light, not too stressful, but definitely some interesting decisions to make and an enjoyable experience. I'm surprised the BGG weight of this game is 2.6 -- it felt a bit lighter than that to me. We finished in a brisk 40 minutes -- which I believe isn't uncommon for a 2-player game, but we're both typically slow players so 40 minutes for us is fast!

A pleasant experience overall, and it's nice to have a game that has a little meat on it and which we can play pretty quickly.

After one play I am quite taken with this "worker movement" game. You need to plan your route across Istanbul to both minimise payments to other players whilst getting the resources required.
Need to play again!
After 7 plays, I really like this game. Every game I try to do different things, some of which work, some don't. But it is a good sign when there are so many things to try the game keeps its freshness.
I think 5 players makes the game too crowded, money too short and with the expert tile layout the game feels too long. So the sweet spot for me is 4 players.

Somewhat dry movement optimization with odd randomness in the form of dice rolls at certain locations and not so odd randomness of card draws to even out the otherwise zero-sum feeling game play.

A solid light-weight Euro. While it does have variable setups, the game just doesn't have the replay value to stick around in my collection.

To sum up, there are many aspects of Istanbul that I appreciate. The many different options, the balance between long-term strategy and short-term tactical gains, and the subtle interaction that carefully avoid both run-away leader problems and kingmaker problems. The brilliant "worse deal" mechanism also makes the different options easy to compare. Whereas Puerto Rico often sees players counting which goods to ship first to maximize their gains and minimize others' (with downtime as a result), Istanbul immediately shows what deal the next player will get. Yes, Istanbul may be a light-weight game in comparison but you get a lot of game in a short time!

An action-programming game. There's a little bit of puzzle here, as you need to plan ahead a lot of steps to achieve a path that best facilitate your plan. Other people's move might sometimes interfere with your plan, so it's not like a solitaire puzzle either. 

This is a solid game with elegant mechanics and game play. The only downside is it might be easily solved as there are only 16 tiles in the game - it wouldn't be too hard to figure out the correct path no matter how you change the positions.

In this 2014 Kennerspiel award winner, one has a merchant and 4 assistants with a wheelbarrow wandering around twelve areas of Istanbul. When you go to an area, you have to drop off an assistant to do the action, but if you go back to the same area where you have an assistant, you can recover the assistant. The different areas allow you to earn cash, goods and tiles, all in an effort to get rubies. First player to five rubies wins the game. 

This is a fast paced game that clocks in under an hour. You are racing under players to get rubies, and you have to be very efficient. It's a fun game, and I'm looking forward to more plays. 

It did win the Kennerspiel, so my expectations were high for this one, perhaps unfairly so. It is a good game, but not sure it deserves the Kennerspiel. There is some interaction with the other players in that you have to pay them $2 if you land on their merchant, and you can interact with other pieces.  It's a pretty compact design and fun to play. There is a bit of luck as well with the dice rolling. Games can be over before you know it, and in this sense, it almost feels like a filler game. There are a few intricacies, but not overly complex to analyze.

Played and dam was that awful, though maybe because one guy was drinking and slower because of his turns. I find i dislike drinking players and their alcohol, it slows the game usually. Also my teacher sucked so all that together soured the experience but i do want to play again given the chance and it was an interesting mechanicism and good components and theme. Hated the tiny symbols on some tiles though esp for reosoources.So much dice rolling and tactical play where you can't plan because of what others did or what the dice rolls ended up being. And some tiles are gambles. Disliked a lot and some small fiddliness too. Still came essentially second after being taught bad and set back at least. I was so close to winning but still disliked some things in this. But the variable setup sonuds interesting and its scalability is good to decent i heard fortunately. I suspect since its a race there may come a point when you know you are behind and unlikely to get ahead. But its short so its kinda okay. Might be my fave race game ive played though i question the number of strats, really seems like just two of either resources for money or resources forgems. Ish.

A very good game with tons of replay due to the board consisting of tiles that can be arranged in several pre-made layouts or randomly.  I'm glad I picked this game up before it sold-out.

I suck at the kind of thinking this game requires, but I still enjoy it.  It's a race, so there's no incentive to let it overstay its welcome.  The locations offer enough flexibility that you're unlikely to find yourself in a painfully hopeless situation.  My two complaints are the potential swinginess of the Black Market and the chance of getting shut out of the mosque rubies in a five-player game.

While the main mechanism here is a variation on the designer's Traders of Genoa, the meat of the game is a race to collect gems. The variable set-up ensures that there will be some degree of replay, but from the start it seems like a few expansion tiles would go a long way. Still, a nice, puzzley game that has just enough interaction to keep things from becoming too programmatic.

Pretty fun game!

Having to worry about picking up assistants can be distracting, but is still a blast. I love the different ways you can get gems. The cards being laid out randomly can let you form different strategies for every game. I love some of the different areas, like the gambling area, and the jail for you to release your crazy family member. 

Interacting with the sheriff and mayor for extra benefits is also pretty fun. And I love the player's personal cart, where you keep your supplies.

The only issue with this game is it doesn't have the absolute greatest replay value. After enough plays, it'll become a pure test of turn efficiency, which isn't an absolute problem but... it can be.

Visually nice, simple and very enjoyable game. High replayability value as changing the tiles location on the board may significantly change the length and complexity of the game. The dynamic is totally different between a 2-players and 5-players game. However, with many players, the starting players will race for the big perks (die modifier being the best IMO) while last players will have to come up with some sort of fallback plan. Ideal game for introducing players to the race/movement optimization genre. This game is rather inexpensive and totally worth the investment!

RATING: 5
Was expecting a worker placement game and wound up with my first experience with pick-up and deliver gameplay. 

Having actually worked delivery jobs in real life, my friends and I felt Istanbul lacked any sense of urgency. In real life you're always racing a ticking clock and not making it on time can result in the value of the trip being dramatically lessened, or reduced to zero. Istanbul does try to emulate this by several locations having an increasing cost to convert goods or cash into game-winning gems, but the increases are minor and several people can use those locations before really seeing a significant cost for being late to cash in at any one location.

The bizarre drop-off-your-assistants mechanic does create a need for route planning, (another essential delivery skill), to build the necessary supplies for purchasing gems in the fewest possible moves. Unfortunately, the plethora of sources one could obtain gems causes confusion over how best to focus one's efforts and can lead to wildly different scores by endgame.

An interesting take on pick up and deliver...as you are actually picking up and delivering your own workers in this race game!

The race goes to 5 gems and there are quite a few interesting ways to acquire them.  The game is simple enough, but if you do not plan ahead correctly you could really get yourself stuck in this one.  In fact the first time I played it I was a bit sour on it, but after the second, when I planned a bit better, the game REALLY opened up and became a different animal.

A great pick-up and deliver race game.

Quick euro with an abstract feel. It's a race to acquire enough resources or cash to purchase 5 jewels, where jewels become more expensive as more are acquired. Luck of the dice plays a critical role, to an unfortunate extent -- roll well enough and none of the other players can stop you. Nevertheless, a great gateway game by Dorn.
----
on a second play, it was mildly entertaining, but mostly boring. How did this win Kennerspiel? Downgrading slightly from 7. Too much goodwill toward Dorn to lower it much more than that.

Istanbul is a nice light game that I'm ashamed to admit I probably would have liked more if I had won my first game.  Great for people who think Yokohama is too option-dense.

Rating drops to 5 and perhaps lower when playing the Short Routes introductory game.  The puzzle is a little too clear.  And maybe that's good for learning if you've never played a PUAD game before, but it's not needed for veterans.  Then again, veteran will rather play Yokohama.

Istanbul é um jogo surpreendentemente bacana. O manual assusta um pouco: li umas 3 vezes até começar a fazer algum sentido. Por outro lado, depois que começa, fica bem óbvio. Cada jogador interpreta um mercador (com seus respectivos assistentes) que caminha por um bazar em busca de rubis. Tem vários jeitos de consegui-los: trocando por mercadorias, comprando e até como recompensar por incrementar a carroça. A estratégia fica em como fazer os menores caminhos possíveis para fazer isso o mais rápido possível - e antes do resto, obviamente. Simples o suficiente para atrair e entreter novatos.

Certainly, the components are very nice. The illustrations are very nice, the cardboard is thick and once the game is setup, with the merchants and their aides in play, the visuals are fantastic.

The mechanics are catching, but also the game is very fast!! Even if it's your first game, once you bag a few turns, you'll need seconds to do all your turn.

Another feature I loved is that everybody is forced to use different paths, but they all work! The game is more tactic than strategic, you have to adapt to the current state of the board, and you frecuently change your actions because of the last turn of your rivals. Surprisingly, that doesn't slow the flow at all :D

Almost everything in this game is a variable element and the replayability must be infinite.

It's an original and dynamic game, very interesting and likely to have a tense ending.

Minimizing the number of movements, i.e. actions used, on the modular board is a rather fascinating task, and the movement/action system is quite clever. Turns run quickly as long as other players don't screw your plans.

Right in the sweet spot for our family. To have so much going on, it really isn't difficult to teach.

I can't bring myself to see the shine in Istanbul. The movement mechanic is a cross between Royal Palace (which did it far better, IMO) and Dorn's favourite 'dog dropping' mechanic, which is OK in itself, but the various market stalls felt like something of a stretch. It's all very smooth and playable, but I didn't feel like I was involved in anything other than a goods optimisation exercise. Which, of course, is exactly what it is.

Score after first play. Other players can lock/damage one targetted/leader/winning player a bit and can cause another player to win. This is bad. Ending triggering after 5th/6th ruby thing is a bit annoying. Game ended very fast.

We played white assistant variant and game become very easy, I only used one time fountain. Maybe I can end game without using fountain in this variant. I think game can be better without white assistant variant. I will rescore after playing with basic rules.

Easy to teach game. Between medium and light-medium, fast game which ends in 60 minutes. A bit luck based, one wrong movement can cause another player to win.

[i]I was very excited to get to play this game and I was not disappointed. I had a blast trying to optimize my movement in order to eventually collect rubies. I really like the twist put on the pick up and deliver mechanic (you have helper tokens stacked under you that get dropped off and picked up from spaces as you move around the board). I think having a variable set up for this game will definitely increase the replay value of this title. The production quality is high, and it has nice artwork. I also think this could be an excellent advanced family game.[/i]

Istanbul has a clever take on Worker Placement where you leave a trail of workers on previously occupied spaces. When these spaces are revisited you can reuse your workers. Interesting, would definitely try it again - I would prefer to try it with the advanced setup or perhaps a random setup.

Istanbul is a good game, but at least for us, the fun comes from chaos. That said, while it is often recommended for 2 players, we found the experience rather mechanical - if Your opponent finds the right path before You do, he repeats it, while You are frantically trying to block him. Don't get me wrong, the design is good, but it's just not that interesting for us in 2 players, as there are many more games in our collection that we prefer when just my wife and I are playing. It really gets better and enjoyable with more people though, as You don't know, where will the governor and the smuggler be, whether the ruby You were aiming for will get snatched right before Your eyes...to put it simply it thrives on interaction and everchanging environment, so when these are not present it gets kind of dull.so I would gave it probably a 6 as a 2 player and 8 with 4-5 people.in general 7

Rudiger Dorn's favorite component seems to be ever-shifting game boards: they'll move, flip or shift in some way from game to game, providing replayability and a chance to evolve strategies. Louis XIV still reigns as my favorite of his, but Istanbul's design is a bit cleaner and makes it easier to spot opponent's next moves and goals. Definitely his most direct and accessible venture, Istanbul is a light-to-medium weight game, sure to be enjoyed by gamers of any level.

It works nicely, and is on the upside of a 7, and has interesting Dorn things in it. Move your stack to a spot and do its action, preferably where no one else is so you don't pay a penalty. Accumulate resource capability, accumulate resources, trade in resources for powers and cubes, earn money, trade in money and cubes for VPs. All standard stuff, but done in a nice package. I like how the board changes from game to game, requiring different approaches ... and how your approach will need to change during the game based on what the other players before you are doing, because you just can't afford to keep paying penalties always being second somewhere. That means the game has a strategic and a tactical element, making for constant decision making. Turns still clip along at a decent rate though. There's a little reservation about long term replayability given that you're accumulating the same things in the same way each game, but the race interaction probably gives it enough oomph. Plus there's some card powers/interactions that are worth exploring to see how much weight to give them. Anyway, I enjoyed it and would happily play again.

a light gateway game.  as a gamer though - it gets a little old after a few plays - even with the random set up.  it just easy for a gamer to look at the board and come up with a path, which usually involves abusing 2 or 3 tiles for most of the game.  yes, tiles can change every time you play - but it only takes a minute to figure out your path for each new setup.

but i'll still give it a good score, because it is a good gateway game.

This game goes to Eleven!! FANTASTIC FUN!! I don't know if it's my favorite Rudiger Dorn game, but I do believe that it's the FUNNEST!

A quick and tight race to acquire the rubies. Scales great from 2 to 5 players. For 2, my wife have settled on always doing the booklet's neutral assistant variant, inluding the Kebob shop, and using the random setup.

My wife prefers this over Louis XIV. I can't decide between the 2, myself.

This is a good medium-light weight game that is deserving of the Kennerspiel des Jahres award that it one. It is easy to teach to others and so far, everyone I have played with has enjoyed it.

The appeal of this game is its somewhat unique action mechanics and the choices that you must constantly make.  The game has two very nice little mechanics that affect your movement decisions - one is having to make a small payment to other merchants if you land on the space they occupy, and the second is the option of sending a family member to do an action in your place, along with the subsequent action that occurs when other merchants then capture and return your family member.  There is good variety in possible winning strategies, although one must not be passive in the quest for rubies.   For new players the most difficult challenge is mastering the use of one's assistants in a way that you do not lose turns because you run out of assistants.  The best tip for new players is to make sure you originally set the board up using one of the suggested layouts... random layouts can create inequalities that give greater advantages based on turn order or make certain other actions much less desirable.

This is an OUTSTANDING game!  Everything about it is great.  The gems that you're trying to get are cool, physical representations of rubies.

This was a pleasant surprise, a medium level Euro with great mechanics and very well designed components. You move your merchant around to activate different locations in order to collect ruby's. Ruby's can be obtained in multiple ways and you must decide what combination of actions will get you a ruby fastest. You have four assistants that you drop at locations to perform these actions but at one point you will need to get them back so efficient movement is important. The only issue is how much replay the game has. After two plays both were quite different.

Quite fun. Have only played the expansion once and so far I am not sure about it, although I love the tile that lets to cross the entire board in a straight line.

Definitely don't use the beginner setup more than once or twice, as people quickly figure out extremely efficient routes that are highly contested. The person that can secure those routes blows everyone out and the rest of the board becomes much less contested.

2 player: There are better.
3-4 player: Awesome
5 player: Good but downtime gets high. The saving grace is that you can be easily planning your move during other players turns.

I've played this more times than my count shows and it's an odd one for me.  When a friend brought it over to play, I loved it.  But once I got my hands on a copy and started playing it, somehow the magic was gone.  Perhaps it's b/c my main gaming partner is my husband and he was NOT impressed.  Perhaps it's just not a good 2-player game. I just feel like there are better "race" games out there and this one feels boring by comparison.  Once you know the path to victory you're going to use it in every game.  Boring.

Istanbul uses Dorn's patented "stack of discs" also found in games like Genoa and Robber Knights. Here, you're moving around a 4 by 4 grid of tiles that you can interact with. You have to leave a disc on each tile you use, giving you a limited time before you have to go back to the Fountain to collect all of your discs. However, if you use a tile you've already used, you can pick up a disc you left there previously instead of leaving a new one, extending your run. So you're incentivized to use the same tiles over and over, but the scoring system really encourages players to use lots of different tiles. You get a ruby (victory point) for obtaining various sets of special abilities, as well as trading in your goods or money in increasingly difficult contracts--first one to a set number wins.

One of my favourite games - ever! Ultimately a race to the finish mechanic but with so many paths to victory, no two games are ever the same (with the random set-up). It can seem overwhelming to start with, but after a few turns, the strategy is easy to understand but challenging to master. Components are good quality and a reasonably priced game. Can’t wait to play with the expansions.

Significantly better than Five Tribes in my opinion. Simple ruleset and with a dynamic layout, the game has a mini puzzle each time you play. I do think the game might become a bit stale without the expansions, but there seems to be enough to enjoy for a while with just the base game.

Rather surprised at how much I liked this one. I brushed it off as being a mediocre KdJ game, but  I got the game for super cheap on amazon.

Decent worker placement game depending on paths taken.  I liked the random board and still had decisions of what to do and where to go.  I liked how spots weren't blocked, yet had a penalty.  Going for gems was a simple yet effective streamlined goal.

The game needs better cheat sheets.  It can be a tad daunting starting it up.  It could have some AP based on significant montes from

After the first play, a 2-player game, I just wasn't blown away. It was fun, but I think it'll really shine as a 3-4 player game as there's much more happening on the board, and more competitiveness for the rubies. I probably won't play it as a 2-player again, other games will fill that spot.

Istanbul is a worthy winner of the Kennerspiel Des Jahres. Players build a path of actions to collect goods and eventually convert them to rubies. The rules are straightforward, the art and graphics design clean and vibrant, and the choices meaningful. The board is modular, which is good because a player otherwise could work out an optimal path and get stuck in a rut. I like the game, but there’s nothing particularly special about it, so I don’t think I need to own it. However, I’m happy to play at least several more times.

Interesting, but it feels redundant, even if the layout changes.  I admit, I am not good at 'seeing' the overall board to devise a strategy each time.  But the fact that one could devise a 'solvable' route in a given game, I feel, is already a detriment.

No matter what, it is not particularly fun until the struggles for the final rubies.  Adding the expansions is a necessity.

After the first game we immediately played again and that's a sign with good games. I won the first 2 games by probably 1 to 2 turns and it was awesome. I was worried a 2 player game doesn't have enough tightness to the board but I was wrong. It feels like an engine building game with power-ups that you could get to break the rules. Bonus cards are also important. I can see I will get my money's worth for this game for sure.

RATING: 5
Now after several plays over the better part of two years, I'm lowering this one to a 5. Some games are simple but lead to deep strategy after multiple plays. Some games are complex but lead to very little increase in depth of strategy after multiple plays. This is more of a complex/static-strategy game. That being said, it is by no means the worst offender and many popular games are exactly that way. Moreover, this is a fun game. 

As an aside. I'm starting to develop a theory about ways to more quickly identify games that are keepers. One early hypothesis is: "The more time it takes to set a game up if you haven't played it in a while, the less likely the game is to be a keeper." I think this is because some games mistake variability of setup for replayability and have fiddly non-intuitive setup steps that are likely for the purpose of balancing mechanisms. A game of simple rules that allows many strategies will tend to pit players against each other with the game as a conduit for developing and executing strategy. Chess and Go fall into this category, but so do games like BattleLine and Arboretum and Concordia, for instance. A complex game is more like an obstacle course in that the competitors are competing with each other to beat the game the fastest or most efficiently. Some people enjoy this, but I find "obstacle course" games to be more similar to puzzles and inherently less satisfying because they are essentially solitaire games with incidental interaction. People talk about "pasted on theme" but I've never heard anyone talk about "pasted on interaction". Many famous theme-heavy games including Agricola, & LeHavre suffer from this obstacle course / pasted-on-interaction phenomenon. I think it might also have something to do with the correlation between how instinctive the setup is and how flexible and streamlined the mechanisms are. If you find yourself reading the rule book a few times to make sure you've set the game up properly with one fiddly bit over here and three over there and two here or whatever, then it might be an indication that the setup of the game isn't entirely to support gameplay but rather to offset problems with game-play that were identified during play-testing where a fiddly-bit is being used to balance things. The more fiddly bits, the more corner cases being offset, the less streamlined, the less intuitive the setup, the less intuitive the game, the more the game plays you instead of competitors playing each other using the game as a conduit. Anyway. Just the beginning of an inkling for a theory and I'd much rather play Istanbul than LeHavre, and I'd rather play either before Agricola, so YMMV depending on how you feel about those games.

This is an excellent light euro game. The movement mechanic is extremely clever and the resource conversion is interesting. I'm not always a fan of games that end when players acquire a set number of a resource, but it works well here, and sets up a nice tight race. Easy to teach, but enough strategy to get your brain working.

We took the suggested starting set-up. And you really feel that the routes are optimized in this start-set-up and you hardly need the fountain as you rarely are in trouble when moving. Hopefully a random set-up will be more challenging.

Sajnos mivel én kezdtem a játékot, ezért az utolsó körben még mindenki jöhetett egy lépéssel velem szemben ezért a másodikról a negyedik helyre csúsztam vissza. De ettől függetlenül szerintem egy igen jó játék, bár szokás szerint nem tudtuk 2 óránál gyorsabban lejátszani! (majd' 3 óra volt)

Dsepite wanting to try it out, I was surprised to see this so high up the rankings: my initial play was not exciting. But, there was a rule played wrong which would have helped a lot if it had been right and I can't deny that first impressions of a game can often be soured when you've not done well. The game was over before I knew it, but lasted long enough to give me a similar feeling to Santiago de Cuba in that it purports to be a game about trading, but is more about blocking others and exploiting the board. One, I think, that an app version would be great for. Is there an app? If not, why not!?

Pick-up and deliver, modular board forming the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul as players race to collect 5 gems. Seems like a solid Euro, and I do think it's thematically satisfying, but still waiting for a p/u&d game to capture my attention (less favorite mechanic). Need reactive, emergent tactics as game unfolds. Dynamics change with player counts. 
Rules are a little bit lengthy for each of the locations (but there is a concise player aid). Game is essentially about path optimization, once you've got it figured out it's hard to be beat (long term replayability concerns). Some press-your-luck dice rolling.

RATING: 5
This is a game where you walk across the board, and in each spot you stop you have to drop one of your disks or pick up a disk left on a previous turn to resolve the action. The goal is to be the first to collect 5 rubies, and there are several ways of getting them. Each method increases in difficulty as players snatch them up. There is a LOT of action blocking in this game, as you have to pay other players money to use spots they are sitting on. You also can run out of disks, and need to walk back to the center tile and do a reset action. Every player feels like the player right before them in turn order beats them to what they wanted to do, and they can't afford, or don't want to pay the cost of going to the spot anyway. I want to like it a lot, but I'm not a fan of race to the finish games, and this game can easily have runaway leaders. I also found the degree of action blocking more frustrating than exciting, and the number of things you need to get the next item when the one you were lined up to take is snatched by another player is tedious.

Istanbul is the latest Euro to use the faddish modular action grid. I like that the action mostly happens on a shared area, not individual player boards, and I like that it's a simple race to five rather than another tedious spreadsheet totting-up exercise. But the actions (with a couple of exceptions) are still of the pedestrian turn-one-thing-into-another type and the interaction is mostly incidental, making it very hard to pull back a leader.

Someone very kindly gifted me Istanbul, not realising that I pretty much only play solo. Not a problem though! There is an easy to implement solo variant in the forums, which is quite nice to play. But I have to say I still prefer to solo a three-player game. Much more to think about then. Very enjoyable, trying to find different ways of getting the gems.

I was so very disappointed in this. I wanted to like it so badly. Saw the reviews, watched videos, looked so sexy, I was sure it would be an instant buy. But the game play was a snooze fest for me. Both me and my partner fixated on a particular strategy and we just kept going back and forth with slight variations. We both looked at each other with disappointment, thinking to ourselves if we're doing something wrong. Might need to replay it or add expansions, but I don't know..felt so very dry. For multiple paths to victory, I would pick any Stefan Feld game over this.

An interesting euro with more luck than most. The spatial setup gives a lot of variety in how the game can play out. Everything about the basic mechanics is competent and workable, but nothing really grabs me or engages me very much. It is odd how 2 of the 16 locations are dependent on a simple dice roll, though it can be mitigated if you pay for a special power. I don't really like how you have to largely plan out a good synergistic path at the very beginning of the game to do well. There is some reaction to other players actions, but it doesn't ever feel clever - it's just making their next action cost a bit more.

Very interesting game mechanic, with players having to find the most efficient way to navigate given the different board setup every turn, also keeping in mind position of other players.

As a merchant you and your assistants navigate the board acquiring and trading goods so you can be the first to collect 5 rubies. At each locale assistants are dropped off or picked up which leads to a nice route planning aspect where you would like to retrace your steps to be efficient, but collecting system tries not to make that too strong. 
The result is a nice race to the goale with route planning and being efficient without a detailed engine component.

Good as start or an end to a game night.

Got this game at Gencon 2016 and have limited plays of it, but thus far am simply in love with it. I love the simple rules that lead to emergent depth of strategy and gameplay. Haven't even gotten to play with random set up yet, but really expecting the game to shine with that. I also appreciate having a deeper gameplay option that still is easier to teach and also plays pretty quickly. Really excited to try this out some more. 

Update: Have played this pretty often ever since getting it and really love this one. The random paths option is excellent, it makes every game feel somewhat unique and forces one to play out different strategies. It's probably my favorite game around that 45 minute playtime.

Feb 2017: Tried it with the coffee expansion and took a lot of the tension out of the game. More ways to gain resources means in this game less opportunities for opponents to get in your way. Now it feels like a game where you pick one strategy right from the start and then go all despite what anyone else is doing. The replayability thus comes from the random board layout rather than what your opponents might do to you, which is typical for many Euros.

March 2015: Worker placement game with a spatial element -- where you can place (or activate) a worker is based on grid movement.

Reminds me a lot of [thing=126163][/thing] as you either place a worker or activate a worker: both this game and Istanbul move very smoothly because there are no separate worker placement and activation phases.

Short and quick-playing. But it's still a Euro engine-building, cube exchanging game, which isn't my sort of thing.
 
Despite the modular board, I don't think there's much replay value; the path to get VPs are the same; the variable board changes the length of these paths.

This game is just great.  After reading the instructions and playtesting it, I thought it would be OK, but after a few plays...it's really enjoyable.

For me, Istanbul feels like a lot of other filler games, but I enjoy the art and the way players interact and move around the tiles enough that I would consider this a keeper. Overall, nothing spectacular, just some light quirky fun attached to some very visually appealing components.

RATING: 7
Just one play so far, with a full board of five players. I think that, like most worker-placement games, it is probably overly-chaotic with the max number of players, and would improve with fewer people at the table.

Rüdiger Gorn's trademark trail-of-bread-crumbs mechanic is here again, and (as usual) with a nice new twist that I liked. It's an interesting constraint on your movements and choices.

I didn't care for the occasional dice-rolling, but then I usually dislike bet-and-roll mechanisms. Your mileage may vary. At least the dice-rolling is nowhere near being the dominant mechanism; it's just something that crops up in a couple of the worker-placement locations.

I did enjoy the game, and would play again.

RATING: 8.49
Fun game.  Great concept of having several 'family members' and to take an action you need to move to a location 1 or 2 away and either drop a family member off or pick one up at that location.  So you don't have the freedom to go anywhere....you need to have a general plan about what you will do.

The set-up takes a little time (putting out the tiles, rubies, tokens, etc...), a few of the rules are a little fiddly, and the icons aren't overly intuitive.

But the game is a good level, a few turns in and a brand new player will completely understand everything going on and what they want/need to do.

Recommended.

This game playes really well with 2 players.  
Light to medium-light, with a cool theme and artwork. Pawn movement and pick-up and delivery of assistants to utilize buildings in a market (4x4 grid, multiple set-ups possible) to gain resources and money, fulfill orders, and ultimately win by collecting the most rubies. The buildings are fun, e.g. one allows you to "push your luck" by guessing a number, rolling the dice, and getting that many Lira if you roll >= your chosen value. Player interaction is limited to paying opponents if you use a tile they are on, or earning a reward for catching an opponents "family member" and returning them to the jail tile.

[i]I had to practice the game for the German Board Game Championship 2014, which explains my high number of plays. I think Istanbul has a lot of replayability and I would play this again (I cannot say this about the other games I had to practice).[/i]

Fast playing Euro game with a strong spatial aspect. In essence Istanbul is a pick-up-and-deliver game for whole sets of goods. You gather these goods through different actions and either sell these to gain victory points or get money (which you need for other actions and improvements, but also for VP as well). You do your actions by moving your figure through a 4x4-grid of action spaces. 

After 5 actions you have to return to a special space (fountain) to gather back you helpers, unless you visit the same action space more often (which lets you take the helper you left there previously back). When you have planned your way and do a lot of back tracking (i.e. visit places twice), you can avoid losing a turn at the fountain. If you position your figure cleverly on a popular action space your opponents are going to take, they have to pay you some money. The rest of interaction is limited to the race for the different VP, which are getting more and more expensive to get.

The game is a spatial puzzle with limited (planned) interaction and I really liked it. At two places dice rolls decide the effectiveness of your actions, which introduces a small random element (besides cards). My first 4 plays have revealed that different strategies are valid, but also the tactical execution of your strategy and how you react to opportunities created by your opponents will decide over victory and loss. [-]Different setups do not change the game too much, but give rise to different synergies of neighboring action spaces.[/-][i]Update: Actually more plays have revealed that depending on distance between certain places, some strategies are in a specific setup better than others. For experienced players Istanbul shares the following aspect with Dominion: At the start you try to evaluate which strategy will work best in the given setup and then execute it.[/i]
 
The art work is quite nice and the components are fine as well. Actually, the components allow for very elegant play: The way to leave and pick up your helpers is executed by the components and how the prices for the different VP rise are both clever. The rule book is okay, but the description of the bonus cards is too short and lacks some examples (most rule questions will certainly regard these). Since it plays fairly quickly (about 1 hour for a 4-player game), this is ideal to get out as a second game on game night.

I enjoy this game. I do think it needs to be done with a variable tile setup to keep people moving around the board more. Some combinations are just to easy to stay and repeat with the "starter" setup. I heard the Mocha expansion adds a lot, so I'm curious to see how that plays. I am worried that Yokohama is similar enough to not need both, but is the better game.

It is very satisfying in this game to take your turn, and plot your way around the board, wanting to go everywhere, but needing to determine the most efficient path, but not being able to go the same way as everyone else. The main issue is that it is often clear who the winner is going to be multiple turns before the end of the game. Furthermore, at times it feels like there should be more to do on the board, while at the same time realizing that it would be too tedious to get around if there were the case. This keeps the game from being able to be truly great.

If I could only own one game, this would be it.  It's one of my favorite games, it is my wife's favorite game, everyone I teach it to loves it and wants to play again, there are ample strategic and tactical options, it's tense from beginning to end, and it plays in an hour.  Most of all, it's extremely fun.  There may be other games that are better for YOU, but it's a well-rounded game that is sure to be a hit with every group.  It doesn't overstay its welcome.  The expansion offers many more strategies, if you begin to find the base game starts getting repetitive.  This game will not collect dust on your shelf.

13-07-2014. Typical worker placement game with a fun spatial/route building twist. In Istanbul you race to be the first to acquire 5 rubies. You are a merchant and have aesistants to heop you. Once you take an action, you get to leave guys behind, but do not get them back automatically. So ypu have to go back over them, buy special tiles tiles that allow you to pay for that or return to the start tile (somewhere in the middle). Nice looking boardgame built from tiles to get some flexability and random setup.

Not sure what the hype is all about. Heavily borrowed from Dorn's older games like Genao, but without a lot of the player interaction in those games - it's a race but a very solitaire one, and a pretty boring pick-up and deliver design. Although I understand there is more replayability with the randomized setup and more players is probably better, I have no real interest in trying it again.

This reminds me a lot of Royal Palace.  You wander around the board, trying to maximise your actions without bumping into other people too much, or having to waste turns regrouping.   Quicker than you think it's going to be!  Better with more people, as there's more interaction that way.

A brilliant design, and a terrific choice for the KSdJ. My favorite game of 2014.

An old-school, throwback game I think (first to "5" wins!). The modular board is a huge attraction. This is my kind of game; I liked it from the first play. Just the right length. Just the right amount of "think." Just the right amount of player interaction. Every game is a little different, and the puzzling out of what the path to victory might be--and then trying to execute your plan--is a great pleasure (or exquisite pain!).

And again Rüdiger Dorn made it to design a really great game. And this time it happened that there is more theme than in his other games. It surprisingly feels quite authentic how you crawl through the alleys of Istanbul and its bazars. A lot of perfectly considered ideas are part of this game, it comes with great game components and the "board" can always be different.
I'm absolutely lokking forward to playing this with the first expansion "Mokka & Bakshish". Could even be better I think!

It's good - until you realize it's a single player game and all you do is compare the rounds it took everyone to own 5/6 rubies, which is the game's goal.

Also, rather obvious winning strategy (rushing the red mosque card), giving the starting player a great advantage once everyone got to know the game.

It's still a good game for people who 1) don't like competitive games where your opponents can upset one's plans and 2) don't play often enough or don't want to think too much while playing and are thus not able/interested in seeing the game's all too obvious ever-repeating winning strategy -
in short, what you might call a decent family game.

For more expert players, definitely don't buy it.

RATING: 5
Doesn't appeal to me very much at all. Everything is so balanced that the end result seems to hang on the luck of someone getting in your way during movement, or which bonus card you picked up. Games always seem to be extremely tight with multiple players finishing on the same number of gems, or being one off. So it always seems to come down to tie breakers. You win or lose and don't feel like you did anything very clever to deserve it, or anything particularly wrong to be denied the win. It's all just very ho hum. No drama. No tension. A bit boring. Then you think that you could have spent the time playing something more fun than micro managing cubes and money. Maybe something with a more exciting theme. (Why is my family member at the police station anyway?)

The movement system seems to have been the inspiration for the game that just melted away in importance. In the more advanced setups it requires a touch more finesse, but still, it's a fairly uninspiring and dull way to steer control.

The only reason I'd play this again is that it's quick. You can bash out a two player game in about 20 minutes and a five player game in under an hour. That's nice, but I've really just got so many better games to play. Some people will really like this sort of light game though, and good on them. Maybe it scratches an itch for some for a simple game at the end of a hard day. I don't see it because you still have to concentrate a bit to do well. Decisions aren't meaningless, just not very fun or interesting.

No negative comments at all as everyone wants to play again. I have the expansion but it won't come to the table until a few more basic games have been played.

Classic Euro - themes, objectives, styling, interaction etc. Not too heavy but requires some forethought. Would make a good family game as a small step up from gateway classics or sdj winners and the like. And the turns flow quick. At first read it seemed a little confusing but it's dead simple.

Very solid med-weight Euro with great bits, smooth play and doesn't take too long. Worthy addition to a collection.

Weve played rousing games of the engine builder worker placement Istanbul with the Mocha and Baksheesh expansion recently. What a superb take on this mechanic with a great race element built in. Instead of victory point salad you are racing to be the first merchant to collect six rubies before your competition can. Along the way your assistants acquire textiles, fruit, spices, jewelry and coffee so you can convert these resources into Lira and eventually the coveted gems. I collected 10 rubies in my first game, but alas did not manage a win. Nonetheless, it was a blast and can't wait for the next time Istanbul makes it to the tabletop!

RATING: 7
Played twice. In Istanbul, players drift their merchants across locations on the board, dropping off or picking up an assistant each time they do so. Players are tested on how efficiently they can spread their pieces out before having to regroup them. That said, I like the feeling of spreading yourself dangerously thin before snapping back to your full self. It's sort of like this quote:

[center][i]“I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.”[/i][/center]
Ahem. Anyway, the rest of the game is your standard convert-stuff-into-gemstones affair. As the locations can be randomised each game, players will compete in recognising the most efficient routes to victory. While this sounds deadly dull, additional elements of randomly moving non-playable characters (a favourite design flourish of the designer's) and delinquent family members mess around with considerations of where to move to next. Opponents' merchants are also obstacles, so there is some welcome friction as players jostle for coveted locations. 

What I am wary of is the betting minigame at the Tea House. There may be a way to mitigate luck there, but it feels out of place in a game which otherwise promotes control. (One game I played basically came down to a dice roll at the Tea House.) That reservation aside, Istanbul is a good heavy game for the casual crowd. It gets a boost in rating because it moves at a good clip even with the full complement of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a good medium-weight worker placement game with a variable board where everyone races to trade goods and be the first to collect 5 gems. 

I'd definitely play this again, though the dice re-rolling power might be the best and thereby, the first 2 players may have a distinct advantage, though, this may be mitigated with a different board setup.

I'm not sure this game deserved to win the KDJ OVER Rococo or Concordia but it definitely deserved to win in my book.

The game feels like a great balance between strategy with an abundance of victory paths while still playing rather quickly.

Good worker placement game with a simple, elegant method of a depleting stack of workers as you move along to take actions. Move around, trigger actions such as gaining goods, trading goods for cash, buying action cards etc. The end goal is to buy X number of gems from the marketplace or through various actions.

Random board placement gives the game good replay value but some boards can end up resulting in very static movement back and forth.

A Goa alkotójának új játéka, le se lehet tagadni. Az akcióválasztás hasonló a Goához, de itt csak az érkezésünk helyén hagyunk el egy segédünket vagy éppen szerezzük őket vissza, majd végrehajtunk egy helyszíni akciót. Tetszett, hogy a helyszíneket háromfajta nehézségi fokozat szerint fel lehet helyezni, illetve lehet teljesen random is, így kellő újrajászthatóságot kapunk. A játékban 5 ékkő összegyűjtése a feladatunk, ami lehet nagyon gyorsan és meglepetésszerűen történik meg, ez annyira nem jött be. Végig gyűjtenünk kell őket, nem lehet a végére tartalékolni, mert addig valaki hirtelen befejezi a játékot. Annyi gondom volt még, hogy 5 fős játéknál egyértelműen úgy éreztem, hogy negyediknek, ötödiknek jönni elég nagy hátrány, amit a kezdeti pénzkülönbség nem kompenzál eléggé. Kevesebb létszámnál kisebb a konfrontáció mértéke is a játékban. Kipróbálnám egyszer hármasban. Korrekt játék, amitől hanyatt nem esik az ember, de gyorsan lejátszható és sokszor elő lehet venni. Kinézetre is nagyon rendben van, a teljes, jól megírt segédlet pedig nagyon hasznos.

[2017-08-28]
Tökéletes hármasban és ötösben is. A korábban írt pénz kompenzáció elég, a legutolsó partinkban könnyedén nyert pont ezt kihasználva az 5. pozícióban ülő játékos.

A decent game, but I was hoping for more. The movement is interesting, as you have to bounce back-and-forth between locations in order to cash in a bunch of points, but I was a bit less drawn in by the decisions than I thought I would be. I'd like to try this with 3 or 4 and see if the gameplay is more interactive and interesting.

UPDATE: It's certainly better with 3 or 4 than with 2. It's still a race game at its heart, which is a bit of a minus in my book. I do like trying to figure out the good paths in a given layout.

Very similar to Dorn's earlier game, Traders of Genoa - the whole order fulfilment and stack of wooden discs movement mechanic.

Enjoyable, but nothing too special.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The rules are very simple: set the tiles, each showing a different location/power, in some order (3 specific ones included in game, or random). Everyone's stack starts at the Fountain. On your turn, move your stack of tokens (sort of like in Traders of Genoa, but not really: there's a big enough twist to make it feel very fresh). Take the action on the space you land, as long as you either covered your own piece or are able to leave one piece there. Actions give you more goods (4 types), improve your storage capacity, acquire bonus action tiles, trade gems, gamble, etc. If you encounter other players' merchants, pay them. If you encounter the neutral Governor and/or Smuggler tokens (randomly placed at start of game), use them to gain a card and/or cube, respectively, then move them to a new random location. But it's all about acquiring gems - the first player to have 5 wins - and several actions get you those (in various ways: buy them for money, trade gems for them, acquire enough other stuff from the board for them). 

The board, made of a bunch of different tiles, is highly modular for high replayability -- different layouts would change the relationships, optimal routes, etc.

With such a simple rule set, you still get a lot of game play! Turns move along quickly but you have interesting decisions to make almost every time. This seems like a perfect fit for the Kennerspiel des Jahres 2014 ... (update) and it was!

RATING: 7
This is a lighter weight action selection/race game played out on a modular board.  Tiles are set up either randomly or following one of the suggested layouts in the rulebook into a grid.  Players have a stack of assistants topped by their merchant and can move 1 or two spaces orthogonally and take the action of the tile they land on.

The movement mechanics in this game are interesting.  Every tile where you take an action you have to leave an assistant behind so your number of available assistants diminishes with each hop to a new tile.  If you don't have an assistant available you don't get to take an action.  However if one of your assistants is already on the target tile, because you had been there in an earlier round, you get to take the action and your assistant back giving you more mileage.

The mechanics are really interesting in this game but I feel like the rest of it is somewhat shallow.  Most of the tiles are some variation on collecting money or goods which are used to buy rubies which are used to win the game.  The board is modular but even with different set ups all the actions you perform are similar enough that this game would probably feel very similar across many plays.  Also, due to the movement mechanics and similarities between the tiles I think players can find action loops that they can just perform over and over to get them to the end game.  This would be boring for both that player and everyone else.

This game didn't click for us.  This is really an abstract pick up and deliver game.  This is our first of such a game that I have owned and not a genre I would seek out.  But I get why people enjoy the game.  Plays quickly and your turn actions are simple.  But even though the actions are simple, you really need to think and plan your moves.  That is a mark of a good game.  But the planning isn't deep.  Issues I had with the game is I felt the theme is lacking and even though I only played once I feel like the gem dealer is a little too powerful.

Love it! The mechanic of the merchant and his assistant is really unique and fresh and what makes this game so interesting. The other thing I quite enjoy about "Istanbul" are its many pretty components and with that the many things you can do in this game. Basically, it is a worker-placement meets delivery game with a twist. 
It works decently with two players but really shines with 4. I see many fun game nights with this.

I was initially soured on the game because I only played the basic setup because most of my games were with new players. Decided to just ignore that and I can see the fun in the base game now. At first I thought this game needed to have one of the expansions incorporated into it to be fun but failed to realize it was because I've only played the expansions with randomized setups.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick to play, easy to learn game about optimizing your path on the bazaar. 

With the random map setup there is quite some replayability here. And there are usually multiple ways to earn rubies, sometimes one place can be a bit better with some maps, but it seemed quite rare.

With the neutral merchants the game wis really tight even with only two players.

The biggest issue of the game is that sometimes you can see somebodies is ahead a turn and there is not much you can do to stop him (one can try to be in his way, but in my experience the two lira you have to pay ti share spaces aren't a big problem in the late game) - though this problem is fixed with the coffee expansion.

Players move around a grid of 16 spaces and perform actions there; like Royal Palace, variety is achieved by allowing the grid to be set up in different ways. Two spaces and some other extras use dice; rolling well is a significant advantage.

To me, this one feels family-weight but gamer-complexity; and for me, the random elements are painful because they're so unnecessary. An otherwise enjoyable efficiency game.

A wonderful return to form by Rudiger Dorn. It's got the best parts of engine-building games but in a short timeframe. The 2-player game isn't very interactive but feels very smooth with a lot of brain-crunching to optimize movements. The 4-player game, on the other hand, is brutal, trying to avoid paying other players to land on their spot while throwing other players' family members in jail for profit.

Istanbul is an efficiency race game with some hidden information and randomness. For the amount of interesting choices it plays pretty fast and has a great moving and action trigger mechanic which rewards planning ahead. There is meaningful player interaction and the game is a very fun puzzle to solve.

Played with both large expansions it gives you several strategic options on how to collect your rubies and lessens the importance of starting player order. For me it’s the best Istanbul experience and my rating is based on it.

Always think about how you should get your next 1 – 2 rubies and make a plan on how to get there with as few actions as possible, make a back-up plan in case of random elements/opponents actions and try to make the most of your bonus cards. If you just do things because the opportunity arises and are not focused enough you will probably fall behind.

RATING: 6
Feels too much like a racing game with no ability to easily "bash on the leader." There are some interesting things here, but it boils down to "do what the others don't do because when someone does something it gets more expensive." So whoever picks the strategy that others don't follow wins. Except it is hard to change strategies mid game and be flexible since there isn't much hidden information or randomness to change it much. It is okay, and I'd want to play it again, but I'm not a huge fan of "first to X wins" games.

I wouldn't want to play this game 5 times per day, but it is pretty easy to learn but hard to master and difficult to know what to do.  I like it more and more.

Edit:  Got rid of this game because it was eventually boring. Just too simple.

Nagyon szépen eltalált felső-kategóriás, családi játék, már-már gémer. A kockadobás első blikkre ijesztően szerencsefaktorosnak tűnik, de a gyakorlatban (pláne a piros mecsetlappal) ez nem érződik. Az egyes fázisok nagyon szépen összeilleszkednek, gyönyörűen felépített a játék. Az első parti után rácsodálkozik az ember, hogy mennyire "szépen össze van rakva".
Folyamatosan taktikázni kell, felmérve a saját és a többi játékos bábuinak aktuális elhelyezkedését. Ugyanakkor, ha nincs stratégia, valami elképzelés, hogy milyen úton-módon szándékszunk rubintokat szerezni, nehéz győzni. Emellett egy harmadik faktor, a jó útvonalak felfedezése, amivel gyorsíthatjuk és tökéletesíthetjük a pénz-/áru-/rubintszerző útvonalainkat. A játék talán legfontosabb pontja ugyanis a megfelelő útvonalak megtalálása.
A mecset lapkák kicsit erősebbek, mint a többi lap. Erre oda kell figyelni, akárcsak a talicskabővítésre: ezek maximális megszerzése az első két parti után kötelezőnek tűnik.
Rengeteg az interakció, de ezeket mégsem érzem agresszívnak, "bántónak" (nincs az a "kiszúrtam veled" élmény).
Jó kis játék ez és ráadásul gyors. A dobozon jelzett 45-60 perc nem hazugság: no ilyet is ritkán tapasztalni...

RATING: 5.5
Average euro, plus some spatial maneuvring element. 

You start out with some workers, some cash and move around the map, getting more cubes, more actions and convert those cubes either directly into points or first into cash and then into points.

Improvement tile that allows you to mess with the dice is clearly the one to get, so you can start dishing in some cash at the Tea-house on your way to the cartmaker or juweler. 

Of course, we only played with the starting setup, and it is bound to change if the setup is changed but to me it holds nothing refreshing. Spatial maneuvring I have seen in Ghost Stories and San Marco f.e. but in reality, would play both games any day over this soulles Euro. Not impressed.

I'll start this by saying I traded it after 6 plays.  It's got nice art and the gameplay is good.  Somehow the race aspect just didn't grab me.  It turned out to be an easy to learn game that is a true contest.  How fast can one decipher the best method?  I feel that we learned a lot about how to get around but in the end it really felt shallow to us.  I'd rather play recently purchased Splendor if I want a quick contest of a puzzle like nature.  There's more angst in Splendor which makes it better.

Ah yes, Rudiger Dorn. Author of a couple of very nice games and even some masterpieces. So when a new title of his hand comes to market, I pay attention.
Dorn's strategy games are usually not on the heavy side, but sorter while still keeping enough depth. And this game is no different. It takes about 45 minutes but has some nice strategic and tactical options and even different paths to explore. All in a nicely developed game system that has a very simple core.
The only negative things I can say is: it doesn't do much new, but what it does it does well. The other thing is that some iconography could have been clearer while other things are missing from the boards, so a couple of extra icons would have been useful.

I'm not sure how the game tries to explain the tall guy, but we like to think of him as the idiot cousin in the family.

Istanbul has that instantly familiar feel of a solidly put together (if perhaps slightly uninspiring) middle weight Euro that Pegasus, ZMan, Hans im Gluck and the like put out with ease. Everything works, and it works well, but it just feels a little... empty. As though there's nothing to keep me invested in trying t be a little better at it, or to want to ask someone to bring it along so I can play. It's a good game, but it's not an exciting game. 5 years ago I'd have loved this, I suspect and I'd happily recommend it to someone still at that stage of discovering gaming.

This has become my favourite board game of all time.  It's a game that can be played with new and experienced folks alike.  It's flaw is that there is no room for a wasted move, the race for gems is so tight. But, this is more than made up for the fact that it is so easy to play yet offers loads of routes to success.  It's fast moving, and highly thematic.  Add either of the expansions, and a great game becomes sublime.

Really charming game of action selection and optimization. Fits expertly into the medium weight category. Little to no downtime. It manages to include just the right amount of direct player interaction at the four-player count (haven't played anything else). And the goal is simple: It's a race for gems. I sincerely appreciate its clarity and focus -- a trait missing from so many games these days. My only hesitation is that, even after a single play, I wonder if there is really enough here to warrant digging into the game in anything more than a passing fashion. I hope I'm wrong, and I hope I can maintain my rating even after a few more plays.

Istanbul has a cool mechanic of moving stacks of your pieces and leaving workers behind.  That is a really cool gimmick.  But, the rest of the game is just trading cubes for more cubes, cubes for money, and cubes/money for victory points.  I wouldn't mind playing again, but its otherwise fairly forgettable.

So far, Istanbul seems to be very balanced and to offer numerous legit paths to victory. The movement mechanic is a nifty innovation and the modular board ensures some variation and replayability. Not sure how this will hold up over time, but I've enjoyed my first few plays. Update: Depending on where the Governor and Smuggler end up, Istanbul can become a very lopsided affair (if they tend to stay in the orbit of one person and avoid the areas where others are, victory is all but assured for the lucky player). Even without that, the bloom comes off this rose fairly quickly ... I think in part because after a couple of games. there is no more strategy to explore ... it's just a matter of tactics forcing you down certain paths based on what other players do (given the high cost of following in their footsteps) and how the tiles are set up. I wouldn't say no to playing this now and again, but it's not a title I need taking up shelf space in my collection.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Incredibly simple, almost gateway-level game, but possibly with a lot more strategy than expected.

On your turn you just make a move then activate an action of the place to where you moved. What adds to the strategy is that you can only move so far before you have to backtrack, and there are sixteen places to go, so there's a ton of options to consider.

Even with all of those options, though, AP doesn't seem to be too big of a problem because of the movement restrictions, so turns tend to be pretty quick and the game has a nice flow to it.

Initial impressions are very good, will have to see how this holds up after more plays.

Update: Seems like there could be a runaway leader issue. If someone gets ahead there's not much anyone else can do to catch up because there is limited interaction. Every game I've played has been anticlimactic as we just play out the final round and watch as the leader gets their final gem to win the game and nobody can do anything to stop it.

Great game with a race element. You need to really plan your moves and execute them precisely and efficiently to win, and it gets sweat inducing toward the end.

RATING: 5.5
The player interaction is deceivingly lackluster. It appears upon reading the rules that players moving around the same 16 squares would be full of interactions, however even when they happen they are a small inconvenience at worst. Blocking a player seems to be a hardly worthwhile strategy.

I also wonder about the longevity of Istanbul. Sure you can randomize the board as much as you want, but being able to move 2 squares a turn means a around 8-10 squares are always available on a turn and the "randomization" factor becomes less meaningful. Have not played enough on different boards to really make a final decision, but the worry is there for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Seems quite good but I'm not sure how much game there is here. Feels like a very simple core that's been obfuscated by adding a few different ways to do exactly the same things.  Will need to play more and see.  Update: enjoyed more as a 2-player but the multiple ways to do the same thing make it feel like you're rubber-banded to the other player and always within one turn of each other's score.

Istanbul is a eurogame where you're getting resources to convert to money and victory points (gems). There is an interesting movement mechanism, where as the merchant goes to a tile to take the action, it requires an assistant to smooth the way and schmooze the owner. The merchant himself is a bumbling fool who can't manage without an assistant's help.

So if you don't already have an assistant assigned to the tile, you have to leave one behind to take care of things. If you already have an assistant there, he's already put in the time setting things up with that shop and can rejoin you. If you ever end up on a tile without an assistant already there and it's just the merchant, then your incompetent merchant can't do the action and has to end his turn. You can always make your way back to the fountain which allows the merchant to recall all his assistants back to him. Oh and if someone is at the spot you want to go to, you're going to have to pay them to use that spot.

So a large part of the game is figuring out how to get where you want to go and how to manage your assistants. You can only move orthogonally one or two spaces on a turn. And the assistant movement mechanism makes retracing your steps an attractive option if you can find a way to do it and still get a useful action.

The other main part of the game is managing your inventory. You start with the ability to hold two of every good. You can later upgrade your wheelbarrow to hold three, four or five goods of each type. Which you'll want to do because most of the time when you take goods you take all that you can carry. Except jewelry which is harder to get.

Make no bones about it, this is a game where you're trying to solve an optimization puzzle. You've got to figure out the best way of getting gems and the best path through town to do it. If you enjoy that sort of thing, like I do, then this will be an interesting challenge. If you don't, then you probably won't have much fun with this one.

This game is all about finding the most efficient way to move through the city. If you can build a path where you are doubling back on yourself so you won't have to go to the Fountain, you'll likely be ahead. I like the random setup option that keeps the replayability higher (than if there weren't).

The race nature of this game leads to some very exciting moments. Several of my games have led to 2nd place making a play for the win by a very low chance dice roll at the end of the game in the gambling house. I think this game will benefit greatly form an expansion, though. You start to see the same situations crop up very quickly. Random setup improves things, but even then it's a difference of degrees. I like shiny stuff and mid-light to mid-heavy seems to be my ideal niche, so I'm loving Istanbul.

After about a dozen plays, it's downgraded a bit.  With both expansions, it's really bad.  The board is just too large, and the second expansion adds nothing but frustration and complexity to the gameplay.  The companion is a useless, clunky addition.  Played with just the coffee expansion, the game is at its best.  And I think it does suffer from being a pure race game without any end of game scoring.  If you're down 4 rubies to 2, you can see the writing on the wall and there's no way to stop the winner from crossing the line, so in that respect, it's definitely a downer.  I think the coffee expansion makes it far more competitive than the base game, and that's a positive, but I won't play it with the letters and seals addition any more.

I've always been intrigued by Dorn's Breadcrumb mechanic (though that didn't save the plodding, overlong Genoa for me), but here it's lightly re-jiggered in a race game that I ultimately found much more palatable.

The micro-turns are a great lesson in how to get them implemented, and that plus the juggling of your personal supply of tokens mixed with the shoulder rubbing inherent in the design is absolutely a keeper.

Just received, hoping it to be a perfect gateway to My Village, GWT and beyond.
Two years ago I've played it once, which was fun. That was with a group of AP-gamers yet it flowed at decent speed. It's not a very complicated game and choices seem pretty obvious. No expansions until Istanbul has proven to work as a 2p game, and we feel that we need a new impulse.

Update Nov.2016:
After 3 2p games I'm getting the rhythm of it. Til now we played with the standard setup, and the opening moves tend to become the same. Time to change the order of the boards.

Update Dec.2016: from 10th play on, always with first expansion, which makes this good game even better!

Wow!!! What a great game! The object is to collect rubies in a Middle Eastern bazaar. There are many choices to make during one's turn about how to gather goods to trade for  rubies.  The mancala mechanic is unique and requires strategic planning to efficiently move around the bazaar. It really is a race to collect the most rubies and we have had to utilize tie breakers on occasion to declare the winner because it moves so fast.  The way that the tiles are randomly placed to create the bazaar ensures that no two games will be alike.  Lots of love for this game!!!

A good Euro, but not an exceptional one.  I do appreciate that this is a race rather than yet another count up your points at the end and see who won.

A worthy Kennerspiel winner. Despite us not being massive Eurogame lovers, we like this one.

It's extremely tight with two competitive experienced players, with mild screwage. Like Thurn and Taxis, the first player to make a mistake loses the game. Unlike Thurn & Taxis, the mistake isn't visible from turn two, which reduces the likelihood of early concessions.

The random tile layout increases replayability, and there is strategic variability within the game due to the randomly placed merchants, different strategies (money versus goods), and so on.

Such a clever and fun design with action selection and pick-up-and-deliver. Has a little bit of that "generic Euro" feel to it, but I don't mind because it so puzzly and neat. A little downer is that you can see who is going to win a round or two before it is over. It should provide a good gaming experience for people who are into Euros. Would smile if this comes to the table again (or I might just buy it myself and bring to the table how often I like :))

What a nice design. There are some really clever, innovative mechanisms regarding the movement and the actions granted by certain tiles on the board. Lovely game and a great choice for both beginners and experienced players alike. Get the Mocha & Baksheesh expansion as soon as you can! It really opens up the game without adding too much complexity.

The downside of Istanbul is that the setup is really burdensome and although the rules are pretty straightforward it still takes a while to explain how the game works, there is a lot of various tile actions and card abilities. It's funny - although the game is not super complicated, I'm pretty hesitant to teach it to new players. It's kind of a chore. I can explain more complex and involving games in less time. Still, I'll gladly play Istanbul with people who already know the rules. 

By the way - no other game in my collection stresses me out more than Istanbul. I don't know why, but the racing aspect of this game and the constant time pressure almost give me a heart attack every single time I play it.

[b]/update, January 2018[/b]: I've traded it away - I still love it, but it's just too light for my gaming group right now and doesn't hit the table at all. I will most definitely buy it again if my gaming group changes.

What a nice surprise. Just when you think there won't be nothing new in gems collecting games and going around markets, here's an interesting rather original game where you "spread and collect" your chance of doing actions in a grid. Very nice idea, wonderfully balanced (we were all about to end in a couple of moves), different strategies, different paths to victory, good rhytm, simple rules (even if there are many details to know before starting).
Very nice experience (irrespective of the fact that i won).

RATING: 8
It’s not often that my wife asks me to pick up a game and it’s even rarer when she teaches it, so I was pretty delighted when both happened with Istanbul. Better yet, I really enjoyed the game!

A quick summary: you have a stack of discs with the top one representing your merchant and the small ones underneath being your assistants. You move around a 4x4 board and you can move 1 to 2 spaces from where you are now. When you move somewhere you take the action of that tile and leave an assistant there. Alternatively, if an assistant is already there you can pick them up and take the action. If you’re out of assistants, you must either go to the fountain or go back to where you’ve placed a previous assistant. The whole while you’re gaining money, goods, and “upgrades” which help you directly and indirectly gain rubies which ultimately decide who wins.

First off, this game does a great job of combatting analysis paralysis. You must move, and you can only go so far. Additionally, if you’ve taken too many actions you must either take an action that’s close enough that has an assistant on it, or you must go to the fountain. In spite of that, your moves and decisions are not pre-determined nor telegraphed, so there’s plenty of strategy to apply here.

I’m happy I own this one now and I’m even happier that it’s a game my wife wanted and taught.

RATING: 5
For all the nice mechanics design the game has big holes in it that forces you to ignore some of the more interesting parts of the game if you actually want to win. This also severely hampers replayibility. Basically you just figure out which 3 spaces you bounce back and forth between to collect coins and go buy your gems. It feels like this wasn't thoroughly playtested. There is a lot to like for a fairly light, fun game. Certainly more interesting than something as silly as Ticket To Ride but it really needs some balancing. It would actually be a bit better if you really had the option of using all the different spaces of the game and still be able to win. Give it a little length and some planning to make you think a bit more. As it stands you just have to identify the shortest route for coin and gem collection and dump your assistants there.

Generic Euro game. The movement mechanic is interesting, and I am glad it's a race to a small, fixed number of VP instead of seeing who has the most VP after a fixed number of rounds. But overall this is the easiest kind of game to make: another acceptable, functional and redundant Euro.

It's one of those games that I truly just enjoy playing, regardless of how the game is going...

Comments re: Mokka and Baksheesh:
Thoughts after one play - I don't like the expansion. At all. I really, really like Istanbul. I don't care how well i do, i just like playing the game. I didn't enjoy playing with this expansion. But i will play the game a few more times before rating. 

Quick reactions:

The Coffee house ability tile fundamentally undermines the movement aspect of the game, making it far easier to move around to get to locations. 

The guild cards don't seem very balanced at all - some enable you to sell one of each of three resources to get 20 lira, others just let you have 5 coffee, or build a single section of your wagon. The more powerful cards seem overly powerful as well.

I have since integrated all versions together, and I like M&B when combined with B&S - the expansions should have been released the other way around...

After the third play, I still really like Istanbul. I think it's just about dropped off my top ten though, maybe hovering at 11. The push your luck aspect is really what keeps it fresh. Will try a different board set up next time.

This game plays very well. It has just the right amount of take that and has lots of options to help keep the game interesting. Moves very quickly and it's your shot again before you know it and it is very satisfying doing the various tasks.

A perfect example of my major complaint about most new games: no one will be playing Istanbul six months from now, let alone years into the future.

Games like Istanbul are completely disposable, to the detriment of the hobby and the professionals who wasted their time on the game's creation: artists, proofreaders, typesetters, developers, playtesters, and even the game's publisher.

Please let these poor souls wake up once this week without crying, knowing that they invested their efforts in something with some degree of permanence.

Excellent game. Lots of options on collecting goods or money and several ways to convert goods or money into jewels. Middle weight game.

Fantastic artwork, and the first expansion makes it have just that much more depth. The second expansion adds more to it and a 5 X 5 grid to play. Of the two, I'd have to say that the Mocha & Baksheesh expansion is the better of the two. But when playing with both together, it takes Istanbul from a fairly light game to one of medium complexity. Any family or gaming group looking to add a "real game" to their home that they can add an expansion to later for deeper play, should look no further than Istanbul (Not Constantinople!)

A test in route optimization. 

Fun theme and great pacing. My one complaint would be that since all the tiles are used every game there's really not that much variance from game to game. And after you've played a few times players generally get really good at immediately identifying the best path. 

If we continue to enjoy it I'll definitely be picking up the expansion to add variety.

-- Sold: 10/30/16 - While very enjoyable it just seemed like too many games were getting picked over this one. Have Yokohama on the way, hopefully that fills in =/

There is literally nothing wrong with this game. Fun theme, fun concept, and player that make better decisions win. Very low on luck factor which I prefer from my games.

RATING: 9
The multitude of the ways in which victory can be achieved means that every game is challenging - can I do everything I need to in time? Can I play spoiler to one of the opponents? With the new expansions out, it will be this much harder to get bored with it too :)

RATING: 7
Elegant game that is quickly explained, and provides a nice spatial puzzle. The endgame can be very tense, with multiple people close to getting their fifth gem, but if someone got out to a good start, it is difficult to stop them. 
Enjoyable.

I was first introduced to this game at Gen Con 2014 and was pleasantly surprised. I was even more surprised to find out that I had been playing it wrong for the first handful of times as well but was happy that, not only did what we were doing wrong speed up the play of the game, it also didn't take away anything from the game that I really enjoyed.

The game does fit in to the "gateway game" weight but I don't think that does it justice. The mechanics are simple but there is a lot of strategy. In many ways, you need to be slightly tactical in what you're doing. As everyone is able to see your "wheelbarrow", the number of goods that you're carrying and how close you are to winning the game (e.g., gems), there's a need to be somewhat strategic in how you approach the end of the game. Being able to take advantage of many paths to victory is very beneficial to ensuring that you have options as your opponents block or race for the same objectives.

The ability to change the setup of the game, along with the simple mechanics and game length, makes this game a no-brainer to me. It is an engaging light to medium weight game with a fair amount of strategy in a deceptively simple package.

RATING: 7
Great spin on worker placement. Adding Movement restrictions and Board layout in this manner is great. Although I feel that going last in a 4-5 player game is too great a disadvantage, you will NEVER be able to go to worthwhile spots without paying 2 to whomever is already there. I honestly think this is best with three players. Still a good Euro that gets an occasional play

Rating based on 1 play. 

Before I played this game I was only mildly interested in it. It looked like a colorful medium-weight euro, but since there are so many of those out there, I didn't pay any particular attention to it (despite its Kennersspiel award).

But then I played it... and I was hooked. This was surprisingly fun! I only played one game and didn't really know what I was doing it, so I ended up dead last, but I found it really interesting and wouldn't have minded to play it once more immediately after that. I feared this would be a game with a lot of AP, but it was barely there, so that was great. The artwork is gorgeous. The fact that you can have a modular board each time you play is fantastic. The mechanic of dropping and picking up your workers worked out a lot better than I'd anticipated.

I'm really looking forward to my next game of Istanbul!

2-4 players. Bought this blind at Essen because for 24€ and with "Kennerspiel 2014" it should be worth it. So far 1.5 plays. The material is nice and the artwork is pretty. The theme is well done. Overall I like the gameplay, not very complicated to explain except for the movement mechanism. On my first try I had to go to the Well quite a lot to reset my helpers, on the second try I managed to win the game without going to the Well at all. It's a little low on interaction in a two player game. It plays quite fast. A nice, accessible euro game. Not overly complex. Very few random elements (which is a plus). Next time though I'll try the more complicated layout. Oh and the rules don't really explain how to move the smuggler and the governor - the die roll is a sum and there are 16 tiles and they never explain that it's a sum - of course what else can it be. I deduced that some tiles are just not part of the random movement.

A really great game by one of my favorite designers, Rudiger Dorn.  If you love thinky, unique, mechanics-driven games that cause you to form a strategy and adjust as the board lay out changes, this is a great game for you.  One of my top games of 2014!

Fun Pickup and Deliver Game that is very easy to get into. The symbols on the cards and marketplaces are easy to graps and once players have understood them it is not a difficult game. This is also supportet by one of the best players aids ever.
The game still offers much room for strategy, especially with some advanced variants in the rules, and a lot of variability in the setup.

Both my plays have been with the suggested starting layout and I have found that I'm starting to understand the route planning and efficiency that the game promotes. I'm surprised that I actually like this game since it's not normally the type of game I'd want to play. There's something about Istanbul that makes me think about the strategy afterwards and mull over choices. I'd like to play this game a little more but I know I'd have a hard time convincing the wife.

Lots of different ways to approach this; I think Rüdiger Dorn has created another very fun game.  The familiar stacks of mancala-inspired strewing — pretty much trademark Dorn — are not used at all in his usual way; however, as the game progresses, you figure out that they sort of are, but with a little evolution that really is interesting.  I think this game has a lot of replay value, with plenty to explore, especially because the customizable board really discourages strategy ruts, I'd imagine.

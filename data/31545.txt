Real charming bluffing game that mixes math and poker.  Lots of laughs, but the end game trigger is lacking.  Players can sit out for a while if they get eliminated, so the game isn't perfect, but it's a lot of fun.

[ESP] No podras para de reir en este juego en que los jugadores se convierten en indios. Cada uno se pone una pluma con un numero en la cinta que llevan en la frente. Se trata de adivinar la suma de los numeros de todas las plumas. Pero solo se pueden ver las plumas de los otros y no la propia. Quien adivine y fanfarronee mejor puede nombrarse cacique y organiza el proximo Pow Wow.

As they say, inverted Liar's Dice.  I think it succeeds more as an activity than a game, but success is success.  Game-wise I found the all-but-one-variable open information to lend itself to less interesting bids than Liar's Dice, but I had more fun playing the game the one time I tried.  Wish it had an interesting decision mechanic like the re-roll.

This is one of those games like Diamant which plays better with more people.  I'd recommend it for 6-8.  Rating will go up by one if playing with Jesse and watching the expressions on his face as he tries to figure out his bid.  Lots of fun and a good party game with the right crowd.  This is one that definitely deserves a reprint.

Yup, this game is the reverse of Liar's Dice (of which I am not a fan).  The game is mostly a betting and bluffing game with a bit of memory and statistics.  The game really breaks down into something un-fun at the end when only 2 players remain, and they must make either safe bets or crazy (confuse your opponent) bets.

Pow Wow is a silly party game that is definitely good for a few laughs.

Everyone straps a feather to their head with a number on it.  So, you can see everyone's number but your own.

Then, starting with whoever goes first, players bet on with the total sum of all of the feathers is, with the goal of getting as close as possible without going over.  This is tricky since the numbers range all the way from -15 or so all the way up to 20.  Maybe you have a -15 on your head, which of course you don't know about, making bidding high dangerous!

Once someone doesn't want to bid higher, they call bullshit, and all of the feathers are revealed and totaled.  If the sum was higher than the last bid, the player calling bullshit loses.  If the sum was lower, the bidder loses.  Once you lose 3 rounds, you're out of the game.  Last man standing wins!

Overall, good for a chuckle, but not something I'd be interested in playing often.

Pow Wow is one of those games that every new gamer has to try. It's essentially a card counting game, though in this case it's all about calculating your opponents' numbers to best guess your own, which is always hidden from you. Excellent choice for teaching newbies and making them feel comfortable, as the laughs tend to come easy with this game.

Feels like Liar's Dice, but looks like Indian Poker?  I've never played Indian Poker per se, but it's probably very similar. In this case, you're declaring the total of all the numbers on everyone's heads, but you can't see your own.  Declarations are like Liar's Dice.  Raise, or call.  Some feathers have extra bits (x2, draw a random card, largest # is really 0) that make for significant swings of fate.  Light, but very fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
In this game you put Indian feathers in a head hard and then on your tun you look at all the numbers on the headband and then try to figure out what you have and then progressively each person is saying a number that is increasing in value until someone calls out if they think it has gone over the total number. I enjoyed the play of this game.

Pow Wow is ridiculous fun. You wear a headband and stick a feather in it that faces your opponents and which you cannot see. There are numbers and some special symbols on the feathers that range from -10 to +20. You go around the table either increasing the bid for how many points in total you think there are or calling. It's so funny how not being able to see just one piece of information makes it so hard for you to ascertain just what the hell is going on when everyone laughs at the bid you just made. Even when I'm eliminated I still enjoy watching the remaining shenanigans.

This is an updated version of Coyote, with a twist.  Once per round, you may say a number and then add a feather to someone else's cap, thus changing the amount of the total.  It makes the game a little harder and funnier.  Also, plays with 8 instead of 6.

Its Indian Poker with a math twist component.  Each player grabs a feather upon which a number between -10 and +20 is printed.  You cannot see your own card which is placed in your colored headband.  The first player tries to guess the total of all cards without guessing a higher number.  If someone challenges that guess, then all feathers are placed on the table and added up.  If the first player did guess higher, they get a vulture token velcro'd to their headband.  If they guess lower or equal, the challenger player gets the vulture.  4 vultures and you are out.  Gameplay and guesses continue around the circle until a guess is challenged.  This game supports quite a few players and rounds go very quickly.  The components are nice enough.  The feathers are paper and so one must be careful not to bend or mark them. The headbands are cloth with a velcro strip and the vulture icons are cardboard with velcro back.  This is a great party game, filler game, or an icebreaker game.  Its stupid, kind of fun, but if you pay attention you can win through deduction.

Really is just like a reversed Liar's Dice, as everyone says.  It's nice to have a light game that will accommodate a bunch of people that's not annoying.

Everyone wears a number on their forehead that they alone do not see. Bidding ensues, until someone thinks the combined number of cards has been exceeded.

The Good: Some good laughs when one person has an overwhelming card on their head, that of course they are oblivious to. Plays fairly quickly - but I felt maybe a little long. Basic rules are easy to explain.

The Bad: Too much luck, due to the special cards thrown in - times 2, eliminate the lowest card, randomly draw a card, etc. Also, the special cards were not intuitive - too easy to forget what they did and then you could not ask without giving the card away.

RATING: 3
This is basically a game where everyone sticks a number on their forehead.  You can see everyone else's number but not your own and you have to make assumptions about the number on your forehead.  In this game it's applied via Indian feathers in a headress.  Each feather has a different number.  This is the type of game where if it was the only game being played in my group, I would sit out and just watch hoping it would be over soon so we could do something else.

Having played both Coyote and Pow Wow, I very much prefer the Pow Wow edition by Ravensburger.  Also, Pow Wow plays up to eight players.  This is more skillful than Liars Dice with a very silly, laugh-out-loud theme.  It has some card luck to it, but it does allow for a good deal of bluffing skills within the game.  It reminds me a lot of Liars Dice/Perudo but with card randomness instead of dice, so you must deduce the probabilities of whether someone's best guess is on the spot with regards to knowing what the deck of cards consists of (and whether the card has been used or not).  After getting used to the game, start playing with two feathers each player and use the tomahawks.

Silly party game where each player wears a number or multiplier on there head that everybody else except that player can see.  The first player looks around at the information available to him/her and then picks a number (you're trying to guess or be below the total) and then the next player either increases that number or calls it, this continues until someone calls and then a buzzard is affixed to the player who called incorrectly or was over the number.  Play until three players have been eliminated then the player with the least amount of buzzards wins.

Pretty simple game. I just assumed I had a 3 the whole time, got burned by being off by one on a challenge, so I upped it to 4 for the rest of the game and "tied" for first. Worked out for me, and you could probably do even better by tracking the feathers that have already been used. There's also a little bit in setting your initial guess so that a specific person might get burned. I won't refuse another play, but I won't be the one suggesting it.

(Just checked the game rules, and the average value of the feathers is, in fact, a little over 4. Right on.)

Fantastic party ice-breaker! Indian poker complete with feathers and headbands. The feathers have either a number like 2, 10, 20 or a multiplier like 2x or even negative numbers. Everyone can see the other players feathers but not their own. A wonderful party filler that everyone really enjoys. 

After several plays I am getting a little board with Pow wow. But I know that if given a little time off, we will come back to it with renewed enthusiasm again and again.

Can be a lot of fun for the occasional occasion, with a large group of players who are all willing to contribute to the bluff and ham it up and are willing to be silly. A niche game only though as there's not a lot of immediate replay, and the huge variation in card values means there's not as much value to the bluff as Liar's Dice ie there's more luck here. But more laughs too.

Here I was thinking that a game that uses the visual concept of Celebrity Head with the mechanics of Bluff (Liar's Dice) would be twice as fun. But no, it turns out to be less than half as enjoyable.

Sure there is some fun as players look around and snicker at how they look and what they have on their heads but Celebrity Head's humour lies in the right brain (i.e imagination) due to the type of questions asked.

In Bluff the game play is distilled, but in Pow Wow not only are the numbers unwieldy but so is the distribution (despite increasing the skill level).

Admittedly, in keeping with the theme I did feel like getting hold of a gun......

-Silly game, but so over the edge that makes it cool to play. I'd say it's fun to play once or twice.

The downside:
-Gets boring fast.

Great Party Game. So easy and so funny. Really entertaining.
Light game, for everyone to play.
I have to rate it an 8, it's not my kind of game, but it's designed for a purpose and does it very well.

A bluff-like game where instead of knowing your own number you know everybody else's. Otherwise they game plays similarly. Works better than I expected.

The flagrantly racist theme makes this uncomfortable, but to the extent that you can shake that, this is fun.

RATING: 6
Only one play, but it is a good deduction/bluffing game along the lines of liar's dice.  What sets this apart is the silly theme.  It's just more fun putting the feathers on your head and having everyone look at each other trying to count.  Might make a good game for a math class.
Had to drop it at least one point to a 7 because the feathers are just too difficult to shuffle...

Fun silly game which you can bring out in big groups. I prefer Bluff and it's similar here except that the information is reversed - you can see the value of everyone except yours. Throw in some doublers and big plus and minus values and you've got a game where everyone will be laughing at you instead of with you. You can almost judge your feather value by the laughter sometimes. The wife really enjoys it.

This is fantastic silly fun.  You feel a little chumpy because the game makes you feel like everyone knows something about you that you don't, but that's what makes the game so great.  Lots of laughs here as you try to gauge what your card is, based on what everyone else is bidding.  Certainly, there is a lot of luck here, but it's really a blast.

Even though it seems a little finicky, I think that the feathers make all the difference creating the ambiance.

RATING: 5
Adding up totals on feathers and guessing on a number.  To me, it would make more sense to have more variables out there besides just the one on your head, but it's a good party deduction game for what it is.

RATING: 6.5
Reimplementation of Coyote, with feathers instead of cards. Feathers fit the theme -- you stick them in your headband -- but those things are impossible to shuffle!! Need to play it with the expanded rules.

The deck has numbers, mostly low, some negative, some high (10, 15, 20), and some specials (2x, cancel highest, etc). Without looking, draw one and put it on your head. Then bet about sum of all cards. In turn, raise sum or call. If called, loser gets a chip stuck to your headband; 3 marks and you're out. Last one in wins!It's the essence of Liar's Dice, plus you get a goofy headband!

Light fun and it does remind me of Liar's Dice.  Simple rules and a quick playing time make it a good group game as well as a good one to mix casual and serious gamers.

I liked it but it fell pretty flat among my semi-regular social gamer group. Just wasn't that fun or exciting, pretty obvious guesses required, not much bluffing.

[Raversburger 'Pow Wow' 2006 edition] {Beer&Pretzels; deduction, bluffing; optimal 6-8p} Pow Wow is an interesting variant of Indian poker. It's fun; esp. with beers.

The feature-like cards are interesting and add much to the game experiences. However, the quality of the components is not that good and not durable - the cards and tiles are thin.

RATING: 5
This one is essentially Liar's Dice in reverse.  Crossed with Indian Poker (or Guts) where you know what everyone else has, but not what you have.  

It was fun, but I see no reason to own both this and Liar's Dice, and I believe that Liar's Dice is more fun.

Funny party game with minimal set up time.

RATING: 6
Pros: Quick
Easy to learn and play
Headbands nice
Inexpensive

Cons: Difficult to shuffle
Too light
Feathers get greasy

Conclusion:  Pow Wow is a tight party game I picked up for around $10.  People seem to enjoy looking at each others forehead.  Even with the advanced rules, it can tend to wear thin.  I like Liar's Dice better.

Bring forth the silly bidding game and smoke 'em tha peace pipe. Yeah this is very silly and I like it. Considering making my own by printing out MINERS helmets with candles for lights...the lights are the numbers...then you can hang dead parakeets or canaries from your head band as you drop out.

I'll have to try this again, being eliminated early in the one game I played. Maybe it was just the group I played with, but it seemed like it should have moved along faster given the game's weight. Nice components.

There's a deep deduction game under here if you want to go that route. Or you can just bluff blunder your way through. It's fun either way. The latest Gigamic edition, called "Coyote" has MUCH better components though. I'd recommend that version.

Eh, alright. A game of numbers, card counting, and bluffing. Almost won the first time playing but kind of gave up at the end. Would probably play again; tomahawks make the game way longer but way more interesting.

This is more fun than it should be.  It is silly and quick.  It is kind of like Liar's Dice in reverse.  Each player has a number but you cannot see your own.  Bid on the total of all numbers without exceeding the total.

After 1 Play: It looked to be a very silly game, and I'm a big fan of silliness.  It's only the look of the game that is actually silly.  The gameplay is pretty straightforward deduction and bluff.

A twist on Indian Poker, this excellent game (also previously published as Coyote) offers plenty of pushing your luck, deduction, some bluffing and plenty of laughs in a quick and enjoyable combination. If anyone in the group is uncomfortable with some basic arithmetic, they'll probably want to sit it out. That's the only caveat I can think of.

Una especie de dudo con plumas de indio en la cabeza. Se trata de adivinar la suma de los numeros de todas las plumas. Pero solo se pueden ver las plumas de los otros y no la propia. Quien adivine y fanfarronee mejor puede nombrarse cacique y organiza el proximo Pow Wow.

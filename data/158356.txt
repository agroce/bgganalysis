BOS - Simple hidden information race game.  Nothing novel or amazing, but still fun.

A bit more luck than I'd like, but quite a fun hand management racing game.

Good game to play with kids that are 5 - 9. Easy to understand. Little kids like being able to touch the bugs and move them around. No reading required. Lots of randomness.

I felt like real horse racing.
This is very exciting game!

Played the Bombyx version at Essen 2014 - opposite to the "children's book"-like pieces the game was quite intense. The fact, that you have to plan your hand (you have to play ALL cards you have) and to think about what yopur opponents might still have plus the bluffing character makes it a great little game!

Light card game. Highly luck-driven. The three Dark Horse tokens bring in an interesting semi-cooperative aspect.

Ho giocato all'edizione Minuscule con gli insetti che cercano di accaparrarsi la risorsa più preziosa, lo zucchero ad esempio. Ogni giocatore riceve due obiettivi e in base alle carte in proprio possesso potrà cercare di spingere i propri insetti verso i frutti più ambiti. Gioco completamente gestito dalla sorte. Per nulla il mio genere di gioco.

A nice light, deduction game, where you want to play cards and move insects to the top, without revealing which ones are the insects you actually want to advance. I recommend it as a filler, family game.

It's super quick, cute, and anyone can play it. The compact tin makes it perfect to travel with.

RATING: 6
Haven't played since I was in high school. I enjoyed the complexity and attention to detail, though it did make the game a bit tedious and long. The sheets for the ships that showed what systems were damaged and what was still working was awesome and was probably my favorite aspect of the game. Duels between a couple ships or very small battles were manageable, but I don't think I could play anything with more than a few ships, even back in high school.

RATING: 10
Best sci-fi boardgame out there, and it really is fun to play.  Very technical and requires a good background in the the TV series to best handle the rules.  Can be intimidating when looking at the manuals, but it is like D&D and requires patience to learn (and is easily remembered).

RATING: 4
It was good to start with and went downhill with each suceeding race and rules expansion. Eventually every race became almost identical and it far outssripped it's original "Star Trek Universe" Stick with the original game and possibly expansions 1&2. Use the battlecard (Code Red?) damage resolution system if you can still find it.

RATING: 8
Alot of good gaming moment from the time when I played it during High School. I was playing the deluxe edition and it is very well balanced between races. Love the concept. It is a good small squadon game (1-3 ships each side), long playing time is an issue, and player can be overloaded easily for playing a lot of ships. Not a fleet game (too much detail). Later expension seem to overload the game. Later edition seem to fix loop holes, but make the rules very hard to learn. Like ASL, need patients to learn the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game system more than a game, which enough expansions, scenarios and ships that it will nearly impossible to play through the entire system. Rules are complex, but you don't need all the rules to start playing. The fun factor completely depends on the personality of the players. Needs a graphical facelift! I prefer Federation Commander to SFB now.

The cherised game of my formative tears. My only recent opponent moved out of the area, unfortunately. Love it or hate it. Not nearly as complex as its reputation would have you believe, just bogged down with with lots of add on ships and weapons. The general rules are much simpler than say, ASL.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Haven't played this in over 20 years, but from what I hear the simpler rules of the early editions were much simpler.  A great game for those who spent many hours watching the Enterprise cruise through space.  Too complex/frustrating for those not used to the fiddling that comes with wargames.  I just remember my brother writing 'Die Adama, burn Galactica burn' across his sheet, and that was the end of the game.

Very absorbing but too complex.  Haven't played it in a long time because it's so slow, which is a pity since there's no game that makes commanding a single ship such a challenge.

RATING: 6
A very good game that I would love to play if it weren't for two huge problems:
1.  No decent online play.  I tried to build an application (hard to find local players) and was threatened with lawsuits.  There is "SFB-Online" but it costs $,  only lets you play a small portion of the game and has an attrocious interface.
2.  Hard core SFB groupies are a bizarre elitist lot who use the word "Curious" to start sentences.

RATING: 5
I absolutely loved the game the two times I played it.  Unfortunately it requires a rules expert on hand to play it, and I am not an expert on this game.  Having two crates of rules, this is a monster of a game.  Also, the game takes an enormously long time to play.  There are many shorter games I'd rather play.

This is definitely a Con game or a weekend play.

The tactics are strong in this one.  Not so hard to learn the basics, but with incredible depth as you add more rules and races.  Fun multiplayer, but the play time is proportional to the number of ships in the game.  Unforgiving of tactical mistakes.  Unfortunately, I often feel that the fun per hour is a little too low for this to be rated higher.

The most detailed attempt at a star trek wargame ever made and well done too, but my GOD the BOOKEEPING!!! Ahhhhhh...  That, and the tons of rules spread all over the planet kept me from ever enjoying this game.  I didn't take accounting in college for a reason, it was boring.  Forget battles with more than say 4 ships, cause you'll never keep up with it, unless of course each player captains their own ship.  Couple that with archaic 2D strategy and I think it turns into a real stinker.  Still, it pretty much sets the stage for all tactical space ship combat.  If you want to fight entire fleets and finish them in a single evening, go play "Full Thrust" from Ground Zero Games.

One of the best multiplayer wargames ever, even if a little bit rules heavy, especially with all the expansions. I&#039;ve had games last for days and days with people coming and going when they could, adding new ships to one side or the other.

THE game for space combat wargamers in the 70's and 80's. Felt more like a modern naval wargame than a model of Trek-style space combat. Still, there was just enough theme to please the niche and it took off. Later Star Fleet Battles material rewards fanaticism-- but doesn't really make for a better game. Like Squad Leader, the heart is in the original game.

Hubby designates this his "Frankenstein edition". He has the core rules and the popular races from the Captain's edition, anything else was salvaged from the earlier Commander's edition from the mid-80s. He does hope to some day waste a bit of money (his words, I swear!) getting a proper and complete set put together.

RATING: 5
More of a wargame than a Eurogame, so it doesn't fit into the style of games that I prefer to play.  The rules can get complex pretty quickly.  If first playing, definitely start with a cadet game and add in a few rules here and there as you go.  Lots of potential for variety and scenarios so it might not get old.  Early damage can really hinder the game experience.  One either sits and repairs or goes kamikaze.

20 years ago, I would have rated this game a 9.  However, it became way overburdened with rules, and as I started playing other boardgames, I realized that the fun/time ratio for this game made it not worth playing any more.  I began with the original Designers edition and bought all three expansions which happily micro-modified almost every rule there was.

This starship combat simulator was a bit too complex for me to enjoy as a teen, although I can appreciate the appeal of that lending itself to so many strategic options.  Flipping all those cards to calculate damage was especially annoying, but I hear there's some kind of quicker alternative I didn't get to try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is essentially the classic &quot;Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men&quot; system of &quot;cross off the boxes&quot; taken to its logical extreme. The fun in this game is the variety of ship designs, seeing how different weapons systems and properties interact; the Hydrans have powerful, short-ranged weapons, the Klingons weaker long-range ones (would somebody *please* teach these guys to build Phaser-I&#039;s), the Romulan ultra-powerful but easily-avoidable plasma torp combined with the cloaking device, and the Federation with their balanced ship designs ... neat stuff, but for a game that wants to be fundamentally simple, the rules are *way* out of hand (this is the game that coined the phase &quot;chief legal officer to the bridge&quot;). The ship designs also got a bit out of control later on; when I was playing, by the time you got to the X-Ships, Andromedans, ISC, etc., things got a little wierd. Again, the flaw in the game is that there often isn&#039;t that much you can do tactically to affect the matchup, just little things ... so the game can feel a bit more like a spectator sport once the basic tactics are mastered. Again, not bad, but would only be truly great at half (or less) of the rules volume.

Rules lawyers love this game. Haven't played it in a while, when I last did, it was starting to collapse under the weight of its own rules. Too bad the computer version had to make it realtime. I miss turn based games on the computer.

RATING: 10
PRO: *sigh* What can one say about SFB? Most complex, comprehensive & challenging space combat series, ever. Can be off-putting to those wanting a simple "blast em" space combat. BUT: if you use only the basic rules, it's very fun and quick. If you enjoy that, you will want to use the later, more complex rules, weapons and ships.

CON: Record keeping/die rolling at advanced levels can be tiring. It BEGS for proper conversion to computer to deal with the massive recording keeping in advanced games. That will never fully happen due to ST licensing complexities. But the biggest problem can be finding other SFB fanatics to play! SFB can easily become a way of life.

SFB. Spoilt by the addition of fighters (which detracted from the WWI flavour of the game) and a more is more philosophy of expansions, expansions, expansions. If I could find people who would limit themselves to a couple of boxes of stuff, then I might play this more. 
Game mechanics are starting to look clunky in the new millenium.

Before the advent of PC starship gaming, this was it.  Although a bit antiquated, this deserves a 2nd glance.  The game plays a bit slow, but it really captures all the tactical options that a would-be starship Captain might utilize.

RATING: 6
I own the Basic Set of the Captain's Edition.  The basic game is quite fun and quick despite the mammoth rulebook (you can explain the basics in 15 minutes).  SFB quickly becomes hideously complex, though, as you add modules.  I also think that 95% of the interesting backstory and technology is contained in the basic set.

RATING: 1
Simply put this would have been an awesome franchise. This game could have been a 10. But unfortunately we had a team of Baboons do the proof reading. Then we had a team of designers with the same creativity as MAO TSE TUNG. The races have almost no creativity in ship design or weapons. Almost every ship has phasers and a primary weapon which shoots forward and does damage similar to a phaser. Battles end up being head on collisions. I was no longer willing to keep up with the rules to play the game. So I unloaded the whole mess on someone else. This is positively the most dissappointing game ever. As I have said elsewhere it's on the same level as giving me the rights to the third movie in the Lord of the Rings Saga and I hire the local theater company to do the movie and film it on my Video Cam on a 500 dollar budget. Then I release the movie and no one else is ever allowed to redo the movie properly.

While definitely not for everybody, Star Fleet Battles is a complex game of space combat between the aliens of the Star Trek universe. The game requires a lot of number-crunching, and there are a lot of detailed rules, but the core rules of the game can be learned in about half an hour if you have a good teacher. Everything else beyond that can be learned bit by bit as you play through scenarios. Highly recommended.

RATING: 6
Played a fair amount of it in the 1980's.  Perhaps it was the way we played, but maneuver didn't seem to play much of a role. It was typically plod along and pound on your opponent.  The new, simplified version out now looks very appealing.

Task Force Games and Amarillo Design Group.  Simply the best, most thought out, space conflict war game for space combat ever conceived.  Star Fleet Battles continues to be improved and added onto 34 years later and continuing.  If you are a Star Trek fan of the Original Series, this is one Star Trek based game that you will fall in love with.  The game rule book looks overwhelming but is more of a reference guide.  Plus with the Silver Anniversary rules book condensing all errata and rules books into one comprehensive rules source - the game now shines more than ever.  Modules, a magazine, Captains Logs and other items make this a living development with unbridled creativity at the root.

At one time, we were consumed by this game. Original basic version (Federation, Klingons, Romulans, and a couple of others) with limited ship types was a gem. Game system became bloated and tedious with addition of more races, more ships, more rules! Also, while great for playing out one on one (or two on two) ship battles, large fleet actions were difficult (too unwieldly to manage multiple ships).

RATING: 8
I probably played this game more than any other game when I was in school, including several very memorable games of "The First Round".  The  energy allocation and combat damage system seemed pretty neat at the time.

Unfortunately, the game was marred by a  ridiculous amount of errata over the years (finally settled down now I think), badly calculated BPV's and a rule set that would rival ASL. It also wins the award for some of the silliest chrome ever seen in a game. Stephen V Cole and his buddies have pretty much pumped this franchise dry with a large number of expansions that were often gratuitous, absurd, or both.

Stick to the small fleet battles with the standard ships if you want to have fun, and complete a game in a couple hours.

I don't know why I like this.  Only played two one on one fights, and them not even with the full ruleset turned on (Lieutenant level, I think), and it was just the coolest thing ever.  Managing power to different systems in a freakin starship is just so cool.

Ooh, just got Battlestations at GenCOn.  Could that be the spiritual successor?  Ship management, but without the 700 pages of rules?

Update: 6-3.  No need to put up with this game's fiddlyness with Federation Commander to play.  Both indeed pale before Battlestations though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great continuous movement mechanism and some great ideas, but the rules lawyering just goes WAY too far. Could cut out 80% of the rules and end up with a better game.

I was obsessed with this game when I was younger.  I spent hours (days) playing this game.  This is also the game I counted the counters so many times, that my family started calling me "The Count".

This original started it all, and it is my favorite wargame.  As a wargame, it might not recreate real battles, but with the theme, it recreates the fictional history of future battles.  

In my opinion, the greatest space wargame created.

This game eventually expanded into a very complex game.  I still love it, but I now prefer [gameid=19854] as a faster, "cleaner", and easier game for day to day play.  To play a fleet battle of [b]Star Fleet Battles[/b], I have to pretty much have a weekend set aside to play, and I have to study the rulebook like I am getting ready for an exam.  But I would never have played [gameid=19854] if not for this game.

I own all of the different versions of [b]Star Fleet Battles[/b], but I record all the plays for my versions of [b]Star Fleet Battles[/b] here as the "base game," and my rating for the game system is here.

RATING: 8
Fun little battleship boardgame in space.

I address the basic game only - never got into expansions and optional rules and all that (Squad Leader Syndrome). The basic game plays a lot like naval games -- except the ships whiz around each other at high speeds instead of plodding along in lines. Melees are the order of the star-date.

The pre-plot impulse move system made for pretty good suspense through the turn. One was never quite sure whether to fire now, or hold fire in case one got closer to another target.

Had fun with it. Me, a PanzerBlitz type.

If I rated based on my high school memories, I'd rate it a 10. As it stands, I'd probably never be willing to play it again. Weird amalgam of theme (funny, I never remember missles, er, drones in Star Trek) and tons of rules supplements make this (almost) the ASL of sci-fi gaming. Unfortunately, the more supplements that came out, the less like Star Trek it felt like.

However, if they ever came out with "SFB lite," I'd be tempted though.

Among the best tactical starship combat games.  Energy allocation for shields, weapons and movement is always a difficult balancing act.  Good theme integration and atmosphere.

Now very dated, especially in production quality and graphics.

Slow and lengthy play, but it's just so cool to tractor beam a buddy's ship, hit it with overloaded torpedos and then beam aboard to seize control of his ship.  Only as complex as you want it to be.

This game consumed me and my friends in highschool for about two years.  We could not get enough. But this is not a casual game.  Lots and lots of rules, that have even more clarifications and rules if you buy the expansions.  You could really dedicate your life to this one game if you werent careful.  Not based on the Star Trek cannon, you are able to command races, from the Star Trek cartoons as well as those introduced in TOS. But be prepared for some serious micromanagment, as this game requires you to manage energy resources as well as make tactical combat decisions.  Lots of fun, if you have the time to spend on it.

A game that you can only appreciate with time. It is incredibly complex and difficult to learn. However, it covers every possibility in the game. Players will find gameplay will smooth itself out as they eliminate or ignore rules and systems that they don't use. Very Enjoyable with a small group of 3-4 players.  Nothing is needed outside of the box and there are plenty of extras included.

I bought this way back when it first was published.... watched the system grow into something  that became s a lifestyle rather than a game and have recently gone over to Fed Commander.

Nothing since has matched the excitement of those first cruiser on cruiser battles.

RATING: N/A
A game that shows the 80's wargame style of special rules for everything, and the dozens of expansions that completely bury the original idea of the game.

The basic idea, allocating power to weapons, shields, and engines, while maneuvering to attack the enemy, is good.

This game did not age well but in it's day we would play 8 hours without blinking and trying to take out the GORN captain "Ogum" I loved playing the Romulans and kicking out a nuclear space mine. Lee F. played Tholians and Virgil G. played Kzintis and Dan? Hydrans and Steve G. feds. I don't think any game rule system has had more errata :) I was also captain in winner of the first SFB space hockey tournament using a Andomeden as a puck. We could not shoot each other just the puck so we where up on the score board so I allocated all my energy to tractor beams and life support surprising the hell out of the other side and tractoring 3 enemy ships at once it was a movement impulse nightmare but made it so we won yeah  :D It even got mentioned in a Captains Log a year or two or three later.

RATING: 4
Way too complex and fiddly for my taste.  I gave it a try when I was younger, but for all the Star Trek theme and flavor, everything always emphasized gaming the system rather than the theme.

For example, there were key tactical concepts that centered around taking advantage of flaws in the impulse turn sequence.

Rather than fix these flaws in simulation, the designers praised the "tactics" of those who exploited them.

Coming from a simulation background prior to this game, that always rubbed me the wrong way.

A great game for playing 1 or 2 vessels a side in multiplayer or 1 to 6 vessels a side head-to-head.  The different races each have their weaknesses and strengths.

This game was one of my favorites back in my teens and twenties. 
I had the Commander's Edition, Volumes 1,2,and 3
Much to my dismay, the collection ended up in a box that was mistakenly taken to the garbage.
These days, I don't have time or space to play and it doesnt exist on vassal so I probably wont replace it with the Captain's Edition.
Extremely fun game, even if you aren't in to Star Trek but oh the book keeping...  holy cow.
Funny how, "Ahead warp 6" and "fire phasers" boils down to a mountain of paper work...  haha
Would still like to play it again some day.

If only rating the nostalgia factor for me, it would be a '9'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Circa '85 to '89, this was a huge '10'.

Current rating is based on a been-there-done-that viewpoint, along with feature creep that came later.

My rating is contingent on the house rules listed below.  Without these rules, the rating drops under 5.

Expansions:
Advanced Missions, C1, C2, C3, Y1, Y2, a few Captain's Logs, the strategy manual, and A Call to Arms.

Miniatures:
(1) Romulan War Eagle
(1) Federation Old Light Cruiser

House Rules:

-Allowed rules and ships are contained in the basic, advanced, C1, C2, C3, Y1, Y2, and T modules.  Errata after 1990CY or additional rules must be approved by the house and unanimous player consent PRIOR to the start of the battle.  Absolutely no custom ship designs.

-Absolutely no Worb (Omega quadrant).

-Tournament ships are only allowed if all ships are tournament ships.

-All battles will be Y179 or earlier (i.e. no x-ships, no fast drones, etc.)
 
-Captain's options will only be used to balance a BPV difference between sides; allowed items are t-bombs and slow to medium drone conversions (i.e. no armored drones, no spearfish drones, no SWACS, no MRS, etc.)

-Hidden mine rules are allowed for t-bombs and NSMs dropped out shuttle bays.  All other optional rules are not used.
 
-Non-Hydran fighters are only allowed by unanimous consent of all players.  P/Fs, interceptors, and heavy fighters are not allowed.
 
-Both sides of a free ship selection battle must have an equivalent number of ships unless approved by the house. 

-Excessive use of EW may carry a penalty from The Masters.  Real captains don't need EW.  No scouts, other ships with special sensors, or ECM drones.

-Announcing firing after an opponent announces fire is allowed.  Exact weapons fired should only be disclosed after the opponent has a chance to say they are or are not firing.  EW works similarly - an open auction.

-Ships may not enter a battle cloaked, at zero speed, or moving in reverse unless specified by the house.
 
-The map floats and weapon status is III unless specified otherwise by the house.
 
-Tractoring of a friendly ships is allowed at the discretion of the house.  In a similar vein, excessive mid-turn speed changes may result in penalties from The Masters. 

-Sublight ships are allowed at the discretion of the house.

-No player may play a Federation vessel in back-to-back games, unless their first ship is imploded by an enveloping type-R plasma.

-If the bridge is hit on a Federation vessel, the Captain's skirt is singed on a 1d6=4,5, or 6.

-Don't even suggest The Ships That Never Were or Unusual Ships

-No unplotted mid-turn speed changes (i.e. gaming the impulse chart).

The basic system is quite enjoyable, especially if you like 2D naval combat games, which is what this amounts to essentially.

Beware of rules lawyers if you play with several of the expansions.  I'd recommend staying away from these as they don't add all that much to the game.  The entire rules with the expansion is several hundread pages of 8½ x 11 inch paper...  Come on, it can't be THAT complex.

Then again, if you're a die hard, then the expansions are a must.

Many nights of my college existence were spent playing this "game".. Rule arguments were intense with respective camps flipping through source books and then flipping again.. Turns could really slow down as well.. Power allocation was great and offered many possibilities ... I Didn't enjoy some of the random elements with some race's weapons.  Feds with their damn over loaded photons would win their game if 3 or 4 of them hit, and would lose if they didn't..

It can be fun, but this game thoroughly failed to avoid unnecessary complexity for a totally fictional subject. Complexity usually comes from the need to simulate reality. Well, there is no reality aside from that explained in the show, so anything added to that is complexity-inutile.

As a big [i]Star Trek[/i] fan, how could I not get this game?  I first bought it when it was in the pocket portfolio format, and eventually got the boxed versions and some of the expansions as well.  IMHO it is a great starship combat game and the solitaire scenarios are good, too.

[b]Note:[/b] I removed all of the SSD books and expansions from this list (except for the Commander's Rulebook and Cadet Training Manual) because they are not stand-alone games.

I loved this game - again, I'm a big star trek fan, and loved the theme and scale (ship to ship combat, and the scaling works well on both single ship and fleet encounters).  Many 'extra rules' and supplements can add to the game (races, weapons, ships, etc) but also in my opinion bogged the game down a bit - my advice, if you like it, play with what you like and toss the rest...  :)

Really liked this game. I think that the impulses were innovative. A really good feature. I loved the Romulan Mauler. With some good luck and adapt handling, and the cloak of course, you could maneuver up to the weak shield side of just about any ship, dump all batteries into one mega shot, and cripple or eliminate just about any ship. If you survived dropping the cloak, of course. God I loved that Mauler.

Are you a Star Trek fan?  Did you always want HUGE starship battles in your show(s) but they never completely delivered?  Then this is the game for you!  I played this game A LOT in 1981-82--loved the Romulans weapon: The Mangler!  My only complaint was the board was just jet-black with white hexes (I know, it's suppose to simulate empty space) but it needed character.  Other than this little bit of bitching, it's a great game & spent many hours commanding fleets of ships against the Klingon threat!  Got my ass kicked a lot too--but it was still great fun!

Star Fleet Battles, was something I used to play often.  But I found I could win by knowing the rules better than my opponent.  Rules memorization seemed to be more important than strategy.

   A really great game and the one that started it all for the SFB machine, still going strong 35+ years later. Part of the pocket model period of the 70s, I sadly missed out on this at the time because I was too young and have only acquired a copy of the original years later. While this version suffers some from plotted movement and other design artifacts that were thankfully later removed (only launching plasma torpedoes at the end of a turn, for one example) it can be forgiven these faults for the innovative combination of game play elements that truly pioneered a genre. 
   Coupled with the limited Trek license, this game defined what single ship space combat duels could do and no one has topped it yet in that department. This version, like its descendants, does not play as well with fleets as it does for duels. Squadron-sized battles are decent but push the limits of what this game can handle with its high level of detail. While some say this is the best version of SFB due to its simplicity and lack of bloat, I do not agree. The latest Captain's Edition is a well honed set of rules with much of the rough edges sanded away. The tournament game, in particular, is as tight a set of space combat rules with truly limitless tactical possibilities as you will find and may be the perfect starship dueling game. Some, however, find it too limiting and prefer the "historical" game with varieties of ships and expanded rules that the tournament does not include. 
   That said, this version launched the SFB empire and deserves its place in war gaming history.

This is the last word in Capital ship combat games for the 23rd century.  The immersive rule set will truly make you feel like you're the nervous captain of a powerful yet vulnerable starship hurtling through space destroying your enemies.

As a game progresses I grow to love my SSD and caress it, wincing at every box that gets blackened out by enemy disrupter fire.  Unbidden, James Horner's music from Wrath of Kahn plays in the back of my mind with its incessant horns and tortured strings accompanied by tribal percussion beats.

My heart yearns for the next game of this classic space combat simulation.

Fun game as long as you stick to a more basic ruleset. ECM and ECCM, throw those rules out. Wild weasels rules for make no sense and are extremely irritating, how does a shuttle suddenly absorb that much firepower and slow down much faster weapons? Use them but when the shuttle is hit by the first one it's gone and can't attract more drones etc. I guess they make as much sense as the 2D universe... and that brings me to the STTNG rant, why do they always fly through "space anomalies"?  ;-)

But in its time it was easily a 7.  Played this, loved this in the late 80's.  In all of our games we only ever blew up one ship, you have to work through SO MANY BOXES to do that.  So many boxes.  And I had to gang up on him with a lot of unanswered plasma torpedoes to pull that off.  Somewhere in a nameless sub-level of the drifting hulk, some ensign was piloting that ship from fourth-backup life support.  SFB can't hold up to modern improvements in space combat simulation, the latest of which is Attack Vector:  Tactical.

Star Fleet Battle is the best Sci-Fi wargame I ever had.  Actually why some people would think that SFB is a complex game intrigues me. I always think it is not a complex game per se, when you consider how complex Advanced Squad Leader or Advanced Third Reich is. In fact SFB was a game I played during teenager and I found it incredibly fun while playing with others (when we still had the luxury of time), each commanding a battleship for duels in the universe and for the Empire (or the Federation for that matter). Phaser, drone, torpedo, guided missiles chasing after the enemy until it runs out of gas.....and wahha! You&#039;ve got a hit! Perhaps I missed its complexity of delving into other following modules after the basic game. But the simple fun of allocating the energy to engines and the roll of dice to see which part of the enemy ships being hit are still lingered in my mind.  Furthermore, things may, however, get complicated if everyone commands a whole fleet of ships.  Rolling action begins.....  
The PC version of the Star Fleet Battles is the &quot;Star Trek: Fleet Command&quot; by Interplay. It is a 3D model of the 2D individual ship. All the mechanics of the boardgame, as the PC game developer claims, are modelled without the roll of the dice to determine which part to hit on a ship. As a result, half of the original boardgame fun is virtually elimiated. The visual effect of the PC game, however, is a real feast.

If you have... great player aids, a large table, cool mats, neat minis, organized rules (in a 3-ring binder or 3), well-thought-out house rules (in another binder), a good mix of balanced (or balance-able) scenarios, a near-encyclopedic knowledge of [i]your[/i] version of the rules such that you can get me up and running (again) in 15 minutes, and a full evening to devote to the game.

Definitely not for everyone.  However, despite the length of the rules, you can teach someone how to play in under 10 minutes; you don't need all the complex stuff (tractors, transporters, etc.) to have a fun game of just flying around and trying to blow the crap out of one another.  The detail, however, leads to a great many tactics and scenarios possible.  I've never gotten tired of this game.

This was my most played wargame in the early-to-mid 1990s when I was part of a group that would play this weekly.  Most of the games were duels or multi-player frag fests (often with tournament crusiers) with the occasional squadron level or fleet action scenarios thrown in.

With the level of detail and the (slow - 32 impulses) speed of play, SFB is at its best in one-on-one duels and (maybe) small squadron level scenarios.  Gets out of hand if there are too many fighters/drones/plasma torpedoes flying around on the board... just too many units to track.

Still have a copy of the rules and a binder of SSDs.  Haven't played SFB in many, many years.  Would prefer to play Federation Commander currently.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In the Star Trek universe, assign action points to weapons, shields, movement, etc. Pre-plot your movement, then attempt to fire on your opponent. Once shields are gone (shields on each side of the ship), roll randomly for hits inside the ship. As a teenager, played this many times and generally enjoyed it, though there were tense battles. My favourite memories in this game was playing a small Romulan ship against a small Federation cruiser and getting to fire off two enveloping plasma torpedoes. It was funny watching my opponent cross off all his squares after the second torpedo hit. But I have been on the receiving end of it when as a Federation cruiser I tried to narrow salvo my photons and missed. The owner of the game knew the rules very well, but we had to ask lots of questions and he was patient. Different races, including Lyrans and Tholians added different dimensions. Now, older and wiser, I'm not sure I could invest the time in it, plus there is a lot of luck with rolling to hit in combat. But it certainly was a very neat concept when it first came out and enjoyed many evenings out playing this.

The definitive space combat game (though certainly not the best).  Detail out the wazoo, too.  One of the biggest disappointments is its departure from 'canon' Star Trek lore.

Simply appalling. This is starship combat as a contest between starship engineers. The Captain has very few decisions to make and the game tends to encourage a whole lot of non-manoeuvring. The paperwork and damage tracking are painful to say the least. The non-canonical Trek universe irks me. It has a huge following (presumably because of the detail), but I regard that as flies flocking to horseshit.

 A friend of mine had all the Starfleet battles stuff. A group of us spent hundreds of hours playing this game and the exspansions during high school.
 It probably should have been called Oceanfleet battles, becasue it is fought in two dimensions. We thought the game was the coolest thing, despite all the errata that came out with every expansion and supplement.

I see the allure, but in order to get to it you have to plough through a LOT of dross.  You take two hours setting up sheets, scenarios, a careful tactical maneuver, and then WHAMO, some Klingon melts through your ship with one barrage.  A whole lotta setup for such quick climax.

RATING: 4
Was great when it began (back somewhere around 1980? -- I was laready playing a while when the first expansion to the original rulebook came out), I played it a ton & had a blast.  But then they just kept on piling on the crap, sometimes seemingly for no reason that to extract more $$$, and the fun of the whole thing collapsed under it's own weight, the thrill of pumping your photons into the K battlecruiser got lost somewhere around rule 53.17.4.13/page 223, and it became an exercise in rule memorization & obscure options rather than strategy.  The game was actually better when it was still just as simple & unrealistic as the TV show that inspired it.  Thus this game went from maybe an 8 to a 4 -- and mind you I am rating it as I last knew it around 1987, and I know from friends much more dross was piled on after then!  Maybe if there is still a way to easily distill the essence back out and shed all the fun-sapping rules it could rise again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I've been fascinated with this game since seeing it played in a middle school library in 1979.  The depth of Star Fleet Battles gameplay is legendary, though admittedly so is the depth of its rules.  

But what that facile statement about rules leaves unsaid is that they can be learned over time, as experience with the game grows.  You can start out with a basic understanding of how ships use energy, move, and fire learned over a half hour or so, then have a perfectly enjoyable game as you learn how each ship's system works one by one.  The Cadet's game is a good introduction to SFB, but not a required one.

The game isn't without its flaws.  Over time, its designers layered on more and more elements, some of which worked well with each other and some of which didn't.  Outside of bare-knuckle tournament play, however, these flaws don't have much impact on the enjoyment of the game.

I still play this game, both in board game and the SFBOL online versions, but now with my son.

Though unwieldy, it's exactly the answer for people inclined to daydream "what if" Star Trek combat scenarios.

It's certainly a lifestyle choice, but not mine. 

There is no one on this planet who could say that this game isn't thorough. They pretty much thought of everything.

Also, for a rulebook that's close to 400 or 500 pages of rules and exceptions, it is *remarkably* clear. There was never a rules clarification that wasn't explicitly answered somewhere in the rules. It was also easy to find the correct reference location within seconds.

RATING: 9
This was the game that brought star trek into the baod gaming world in 1979. Standard hex map with counters for starships and seeking weapons. However, the heart of the game was ship system displays which track damage and power allocation with choices between movement, weapons and shielding. Races are drawn from the TV series including Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Gorn, Orion and Tholian. Also included are Kzintis from the animated series and then mulitple additional races added to the 'trek verse'.Great tactical game but with a rulebook as big as a yellow pages. New gamers need experienced veterans and lots of money to tackle this one. Ships operate like high speed fighters with a dizzying array of weapons like phasers and photons as wells as supporting systems like tractors, transporters and web generators.

Have played this system countless times.

Combined rule books now available for those wanting to get into the game cheaper than buying all the expansions.

This one was very popular at the wargame club when I was in college. I joined in a couple of games and enjoyed it. I think the system is pretty cool, requiring careful planning and smart tactics. Hey, just like a real fleet battle! But those torpedos move awfully slowly... 

Later on I played a little campaign with my brother, where I was the Klingons and he was the Hydrans. We must have had an expansion or something. Whenever I won an engagement, my commander made footstools out of the defeated Hydran captains!

I played this game a few times in my life and dropped far too much on the expansions. I liked the theme but the volume of rules and such make me feel like this is more for a person who likes analysing as much as playing. I can't help but thinking this needs to be revamped, rules lightened, and graphics-upped.

At the time, I thought this game was fantastic.  As life moved on, I realized that was mostly because I hadn't actually played it very much.  In the end it's a lot of effort for not much payoff.

A fine Star Trek space battle game, but has become overcomplicated over the years and editions.  The basic game is the best.

Tournament duel or defined scenario works best. Meaty rules though but gets better the further one develops the rules.

I played this a bunch growing up. We had a lot of fun, and I even knew a lot of the rules back then. So my wife and I bought this when we started playing TGOO together several years ago. We played a few intro scenarios with just the basic rules (phasers, torpedos, maneuvering) and I kicked her butt; now she doesn't want to play. Of course, I'm not about to read 200+ pages of rules, either!

5 years ago, this game would've rated a 10 from me.  Three years ago, it would've gotten an 8, but I have turned down playing the game to play other things recently.  

I am the author of the "training program" page linked to this review page.

As I've gotten older, I've found fewer and fewer people willing to sit down and spend 5 hours to play out a small squadron action.  It's not a game so much as it's a lifestyle choice.

The core engine is a very good game, and as others have said, it's ultimately customizable.  

I got my start designing boardgames professionally by writing for SFB; I've written or edited or developed several products for SFB, including one coming out next year (C5).  

I used to be heavily into the tourney scene, until I realized that no matter how much I practiced my game, there was a level of skill I'd never reach.

SFB Online is a great addition to this game, especially now that it allows non-tourney play, however, I find that my limited gaming time is going to other projects now.

Top 3 things I love about SFB:

1) The incredible balance between ship types.
2) The tactical richness and depth.  You have a bazillion options when you play, and most matchups have interesting mismatches to exploit.
3) The community of SFB players.

Top 3 things I'd like to change:

1) Remove the tax forms at every turn.
2) Reduce the number of impulses per turn to something more reasonable.  32 impulses of "I go, U go" truly bogs down in a fleet action.
3) Get rid of "rules nitpicks", like changing a stinger's speed from 15 to 14 so that it will move on two consecutive impulses.  Or the dreaded "Turn Break Slowdown".

Have a copy of the original edition. Love the concept, but this is too fiddly and time consuming for my tastes twenty years on. I'd love to see a new, streamlined version somewhere between this and Starfire (which is too simple).

RATING: 6
Very mixed about this game...I used to play it a TON, and any game you play that much and think about that much can't be bad.  But the fun-for-time exchange just isn't there, and the small units are too potent relative to their size cost, and the ships feel much more like ships of the line than fragile space vessels...But it DOES provide a great feeling of being a ship captain (just not a spaceship!).

UPDATE:  Re-reading some of my old ratings, I feel like I'm giving SFB the shaft with a "4".  This was probably my most-played game for a year or two in high school.

You know what's great about SFB?  When you get good at SFB, you really feel like you've learned a skill.  Sure it's a meaningless skill in the context of the world at large, but there's this incredibly rich world which you're a master of.  I remember very fondly entering a game midbattle at my college gaming club and fighting 2 or 3 equivalent ships (captained by less-experienced players) to a standstill, allowing my teammates to easily finish them off for the win.  I just don't get the same feeling of accomplishment or mastery from most games.

Doesn't change the fact I wouldn't play it anymore, though!

When this game first came out it was all we played for months. The simultaneous movement was innovative for its time and it scaled well for multiplayer (a rarity at the time). Managing the various ship systems effectively recreated the feel of commanding a starship. The game was released the same year as the first motion picture with the original crew, so being a Trekkie (or Trekker) was still an exclusive club. We reveled in the game’s attention to detail, particularly details in such geekdom as the Starfleet Technical Manual and the ship blueprints. The most fun you can have with two counters and a blank map.

RATING: 5
I think it is a good game but I am not a big Sci-Fi fan so I think that takes a little away from it.  However, this is the first Sci-fi game that I actually can be talked into playing from time to time.  That says alot about how this game is made.  I think it is a very well done game and will be a real hit for the right gamer....one that enjoys Sci-fi games.

I am a Star Trek fan and I was excited to play this game.  I bought the intro version and a friend lent me the full version to read over the rules.  The game does have the feel of star ship battles between the various fleets in Star Trek.  However, I found that the pace of the game to be too slow and the complexity to be too high for most of my playgroup.

8 with original game, 6 with vol. 1(Andromedans), 7 with vol. 2 (PF), 6 with vol. 3 (Web Caster).  Exhausted (in buying supplements, SSDs and rule reading) then.  Should get higher rating with the consolidated Captain Edition, but rolling 60 times for damages is a lifestyle choice, and many other games are waiting for me...

RATING: 1
Imagine ASL but worse. In space. With rules that are less well written. To be fair, playing a duel between two ships just using the basic set rules is an OK game, but it completely eludes me how anyone could possibly play bigger games or use all the expansions unless they literally played or did nothing else their whole life.

RATING: 7.5
One of the best of the genre, if you can get through the rules.  New editions, re-writes, errata galore.  But I lost track of how many games of this I played in high school.  How cool is it to fly a Klingon D7 Battle Cruiser??  :)

This game hits on all cylinders for me.  I LOVE Damage Allocation and SSD's.  Maybe I'm a micro-manager at heart.  Sure if you don't care for the theme and dislike book keeping it can be very tedious, but for those people who it clicks with, it really clicks.  It's important to play with people you trust or don't know you can't trust yet, as there is alot of opportunity for cheating.

I find it best plays as scenarios or with small (3 ship or less) head to head fights.  I've always wanted to play the full war campaign, I forget what it's called, but it is truely epic in scope and grandeur.

#1 Tactical star ship combat game. Not as complicated as most people would have you believe, the giant rulebook contains many extras that are are not used in regular play.
The game is still very well supported by the original designer.
Star Fleet Battles also has a fabulous Online client for playing the game in real time with real opponents. 
sfbonline.com really is an amazing tool that allows SFB fans from all around the world to connect together and blow each other up!!

Used to love it. And then it became...bloated beyond recognition. At it's core, however, lies a great game. If only the creativity of ships and scenarios were up to the challenge, and the rules were put together by someone who didn't write government legal papers for a living.

Used to have this game. Thought it was the greatest game, with so much detail...and more detail is good, right? But somehow I only got to play a couple times, and it took forever to resolve one-on-one spaceship battles, and there was very little real strategy anyway; just maneuver to try to get them in your weapon sights more than they get you in theirs, then roll dice.Looking back, I'd say that this game has too much attention to detail and not enough to playability or fun level. Meh.

Never played the original edition, but it certainly seems more limiting than the newer copies.  The 'sublight' combat rules are interesting, though, and given the oldest Romulan ship something to actually DO...against warp ships, it's a rather boring fight otherwise.  Wonder why these rules never made it into the newer editions?

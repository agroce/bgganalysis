The lab area gets very crowded very quickly and you soon find you don't have the right technologies in the right places.  By the end of the game (2 players, neither of us had any way to place any more tiles in our labs and thus were just going through motions to get to the end.
I wanted so much to like this game, but felt very constricted.  It seems that project tiles need to have different sizes available.  For example even the "T" shaped tiles that only give you 2 VP's (but require less to build) still take up 4 squares in your lab.  It would have been more fun if we had smaller, 3 square shapes for the easier to build/lower VP projects and 4 square shapes for the higher reward/higher VP projects.

Bella tematica.Peso medio.DIfficile al punto giusto.Non molte strategie da poter portare avanti.Le tessere tecnologia portano via un bel po' di spazio.In diverse partite sono state snobbate dai giocatori al tavolo 
 perchè difficili integrarle in una buona strategia.Quindi sarebbe stato opportuno mixare la forma anche di queste tessere.D'altra parte assicurano una buona base di risorse per la costruzione dei progetti.

Expo 1906 is a beutifull and elegant game. It has the best parts from princes of florence and some mechanics from concordia/lewis and clark/ manhattan project. The mechanics are solid and tense. The game is very clear and what will be scored is contested. This was the hidden gem at essen for me.

Its okay, its kind of gives me the fell.  I am looking forward to possibly playing 1906 World Fair which I think might feel like this game just a little better.

I like this game a lot, especially the puzzle mechanic. I haven't raised my rating for it though since the solo variant does get quite easy with time. Would be nice to come up with a way to diversify it.

This game has been discounted for a while (no longer : ), so we were more than pleasantly surprised when we finally played our copy from Origins.
We like spatial / tile placement.  It can get a bit same-y if you play multiple times in a short period of time; you know what you've got
to do and it's a matter of how well you can do it.  
It's more of a puzzle than a strategic challenge.  Nevertheless, we have enjoy it every time we play!

I designed the graphics and illustrations for this game, so I'm biased, but I really like the innovative idea of mixing puzzle composition, action orders and the theme.
They merge very well making for an interesting and innovative game!

So the "Patchwork" part of this game is quite unfulfilling.  The game is challenging but not gratifying to achieve in it.  The tracks are boring and the pieces and artwork are too.  Barenpark or Feast for Odin are a better choice by far.

Opinion: nice surprise with this game, you have a good puzzle here. In a nutshell you have not so many cards for your actions and you play one that cannot be the same as previous player, this until someone plays the meeting room. I like this idea, as makes you plan what you are going to do and have to take a look at what previous other players are doing. Then comes the surprise, you have to make inventions in your personal board... and you have a really lovely puzzle to solve, not only this, you can modify this puzzle some times during the game.
Liked the game, the card actions and the puzzle, but take care with those players with AP

Excellent game, with superb graphic art, intelligent and thematic mechanisms, and a real challenge. The rules are clear and natural, easy to understand and play, while the game itself is complex and brain exciting. A great creation.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: euro de losetes i gestió de recursos amb un element espacial. Cada jugador té un taulell dividit en graella on col·loca losetes. Unes losetes proporcionen recursos, unes altres habilitats especials o descomptes i unes altres PVs. Per poder construir les losetes que proporcionen PVs aquestes han d'estar tocant a losetes que tinguin els recursos corresponents.

Poc a afegir, els jocs amb element espacial no m'agraden especialment, i en aquest cas no crec que sigui diferent. El fet que totes les tecnologies estiguin disponibles sempre pot fer que les partides es repeteixin sovint.

The World's Fair in 1906 was very, very brown. Prepping for the exhibitions entailed fitting geometrical projects into your workshop, adjacent to the resources needed to complete them, which also needed to be fit strategically into the spaces between your projects. You collected money to buy projects and resources, but only just as much as you needed immediately before having to seek more. There was also some race to be the best at promoting certain resources which benefited you when you were the best and completed a project using those resources. 1906 was a very confusing year to be an exhibitionist.

Expo 1906 is spatial puzzle with a minimal sort of economics and some arbitrary race elements. I was excited to try it as it sounded like my kind of game. I really enjoy spacial puzzles. But because mistakes are not easily undone, you have to be careful about how you acquire tiles and place them and for me, even without AP a real factor, that exercise dragged considerably. The game seems to usually last 10 turns and I was checking the clock 4 turns in. Not a terrible game, but it just wasn't engaging or interesting enough for the difficulty.

It is an interesting puzzle but there are other games that I would pull out before this one. In my attempt to whittle down my collection, this doesn't make the cut. I also didn't care for the art and all the browns and the poor box structure (board almost doesn't fit). 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Better enjoy spatial puzzles as this is central to the game as you organize your inventions inside your laboratory along with the necessary resources and technologies. Game is driven by a set of 6 different action cards which are played one by one in round order until someone ends a round by playing a meeting card. Points are earned by completing inventions, declaring bonus chits moving along the patent track, and also building inventions that match the power type of the dominant power system. Fun system as long as one enjoys spatial aspects. If you don't, stay far away! Colors of the game are very sepia/brown and there can be difficulty distinguishing some of the small icons/etc. Oddly, the board doesn't fit very well inside the box either?!?

Played with Jon and Matt. Very awesome. Has artwork that reminded me of gears and piston, but very different gameplay. I am most intrigued by the four actions in meeting room to see how often that card should be expected to play based on the benefits of that card to determine of the 24 jury spots how many actions you are should I expect to have and whether someone will meeting room on the same turn someone else does because I considered that as well in my first play.

Interessante gioco che fondamentalmente è un puzzle. Nulla di originale nelle meccaniche, poche regole così come le azioni da fare, necessita di una buona dose di pianificazione anche se non manca una discreta interazione. Gioco pulito e lineare ma che non fa scattare nessuna scintilla malgrado la tematica. Buono ma non imprescindibile.

Brain burner but too solitaire-ish for our tastes. You spend more time onto Your board than on regular game fighting with opponents. 
Making inventions is real brain burning thing but it's always Your private puzzle inside propper game.
Nice idea but it could be changed to more strategic and less solitaire type of game.

RATING: 6

First thing that I appreciate: the rules are clear, they are well written and we had no rule-issues during our play. This clearly has been playtested enough. As also everything works well together. It has the card mechanism from Historia (a round ends when someone plays a certain card) and for the rest it's the classic resource collection thing with some extra puzzling in the hope you can optimize things. 

What was a bit of a disappointment was that the technologies/improvements didn't seem to be worth investing in, as they take up a lot of space, which makes it almost impossible to built a 5th invention, but are not rewarding enough to compensate for a 5th invention. At least that was our feeling after our play.

What I certainly dislike is the artwork: it gives you an instant depression by just looking at it. 

I've decided I won't keep this one in my collection. It doesn't feel like it has something extra that has an added value to my collection (which is off course hard if you own almost 1.000 games :s) and I think replay ability will be too low.

This is a delightful game where players are competing to complete projects. The project tiles are these neat brown tetris like pieces that you lay into your player grid, and then have to surround the projects with tiles that have printed symbols matching those things on the projects. When completed the project scores, and you get bonus points for having the top marker on the chart area also matching those symbols. The game is very tight, and points are hard to come by, which is fascinating as you try your very best to squeeze out every point.

Until you're an expo master, be prepared to spend a lot of actions re-arranging your board and burning your brain trying to make every important piece fit. It's a good burn though, and certainly rewards the more proficient player. Pairs well with the constricted card play and racing up the side progress board. This game deserves more attention.

tl;dr: that's a lot of brown!

Yes, so this game is very brown and certainly could have looked more attractive. But looks aside, how does it play, you wonder? So did I. The answer is: quite well. This is quite a decent though pretty abstract strategy game.
There are a bunch of different components and mechanisms that interlock quite nicely.
That being said: I wasn't blown away and while the game is worth playing, I did feel like it could have used a bit more development to balance the different elements a bit more.

Strategy challenge of industrial and science advancement simulation to race to file patents and/or create steam or electric powered inventions for the World Exposition at the turn of the century.  In turn order, play action cards from identical player decks to get invention blue prints, go to the academy for tech tree advancements, get invention components, and manage tight finances.  Action decks replenish when a player calls a meeting.  The player laboratory is the distinct feature where invention and component puzzle tiles are arranged to gain the most benefit.  Limited space increases this challenge as the game progresses.  Limited supply makes it crucial to anticipate other player action choices.

Puzzle, Tetris-like game where you need to place Tetris-styled tiles on your board; these tiles can be projects, or (chits) research technologies. These chits need to connect to your projects in order to score.  There is also a race to be the "lead" on certain technologies.  Its a puzzle game and can be quite frustrating if you get it wrong and it can take a bit of time to fix issues to get your projects done.

Pretty good game, not sure I'd buy it though.

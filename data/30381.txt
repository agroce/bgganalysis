My first encounter with the rondel. Rated after one 2-player game. Lovely game. The board and bits are large and awsome. I mean, real clay bricks and cute little church bells! Use yours to taunt your opponent while he/she is undergoing AP!

RATING: 7.5
Solid Euro with excellent components, a solid theme, very good scalability, and straightforward gameplay.

The goal of the game is to build churches in the city of Hamburg (or London, as it's a double-sided board), and keep in mind, this is THE way to score points.  The mechanism is the rondel, and as this is the first rondel game I've played, I found the mechanism to be simple and reasonably unique.  You can select several different actions (produce goods- beer/cloth/sugar, trade goods for money OR buy resources, make donations to the church, build buildings, and build ships).  Essentially, the goal is to produce goods, which can be shipped for money (trade), use the money to buy resources (brick, wood, and church bells), also through trade, and use these resources (can include money) to build further infrastructure such as ships and buildings which will in turn advance opportunities for more money and potentially points, and of course make donations with the resources in order to generate points.  Again, points are obtained through making donations which yield church donation tokens which can be scored for points.

The game ends when all of the churches (I believe it's 6 of them) are built.  

The components for this game are absolutely top notch, and it's pretty thematic.  I've played 2,4, and 5 player and it works very well with each number.  Right off the bat my wife liked it, so it's a keeper for me.  It's solid if not spectacular.

Own the [boardgame=81848]Antverpia[/boardgame] expansion.

Didn't really do it for me. The rondel was interesting though (Hamburgum was my first rondel-based game).

Edit: 4 years and several rondels later I finally try it again and find it more interesting and worthy of further exploration.

You buy and sell resources to help build churches in Germany in this economic optimization game. It's not really my type of game, but it has some things going for it that make it more fun and cool than your average optimization exercise. The rondel is a cool mechanism, plus the brick actually look and feel like brick (I was so surprised at this, expecting bricks to be a red wodden cube), the bell [i]actually looks like a bell[/i]... and the wood is a [i][b]real[/b] piece of wood![/i] That's [i]crazy![/i]

This is my favorite of the rondel games. I enjoy the lack of combat, the battles in Imperial and Antike always kind of annoyed me. This game is fun, moves quickly, and has some neat positioning elements. Timing is key. I may not need to keep my other Gerdts games now that I have this in my collection.

Initial reaction to a single 5 player game using the Hamburg board. Excellent and likely to be the best of my picks from Essen. Love the theme. Update - This, and Amyitis by Ystari, are my joint best of show for Essen 07. Both are top notch games and highly recommmended.

Update: played a 4 player tonight and took a bit of a drubbing. Still very much enjoyed it however which is the sign of a very good game. Just need to work out what I did wrong...

There's a lot going on and I think it's the best Rondel game I've played so far - though I haven't got to Navegador yet. Lovely board and bits and great that you get two sides to it.  I am wondering whether it will appear at little too jig-saw-puzzly and scripted in time, but we'll see.  That may not be a problem.  I also liked the screwage involved in building ships to knock others ships pout of the port - especially if you employ the captain.  I can see myself trying different things each time I play, so that's a good sign.

Played this with four people, one of whom had played before. It was treated as a learning experience and the knowledge picked up from a previous game showed through. The game has many facets, with plenty of control on your own options, short term goals to achieve in terms of game progress and many longer term goals. The player interaction is not extensive, but sufficient that you need to beware of what other players are up to on the board, as well as in the purchase of ships. 

My impression is that Hamburgum acheives a great deal in 75 to 90 minutes of entralling gameplay with very little to dislike and much to admire in the clean gameplay. One of the excellent games to come from Essen 2007 and the best use of the clever rondel mechanism. Extremely good game with 4. I will later test with 3 and 5 players I am sure.

After Murano, my favourite "rondel" game! Much better than Herr Gerdts' Navegador; and while being a euro, it nevertheless "feels" thematic. Surprisingly easy rules (with a surprisingly badly translated rulebook: some of the word choices can leave players confused about what exactly gets scored). 

I'd probably rate Hamburgum considerably higher than a 9, but I'm still not certain about the replay value given the lack of anything random. We'll see.....

UPDATE: Looks like there is more of a line-of-play in here than I thought. Based on another play, I raised my rating from 7 to 8, but let's see what happens with more plays.

UPDATE: 8 seems good, but only 3 and up. Hamburgum is not great with 2.

UPDATE: I'm just not convinced of it's depth. I'll keep it at 6 because there are a lot of economical things to consider and timing is important.

Quite a pleasant surprise.  I'd avoided Hamburgum because of its hackneyed produce stuff, sell it, spend the profits to gain v.p.'s Euro-efficiency mechanics.  And indeed, a lot of the game is about ordering your actions as efficiently as possible.  The rondel again does a good job of making that an interesting exercise and keeping downtime to a minimum. What raises Hamburgum in my estimation is a nice level of screwage through purchasing buildings to constrict others' networks on the board, through making donations to grab a key multiplier from under an opponent's nose, and by purchasing ships to drive others' shipping capacity down.

The board and component artwork is all nice, clear and easy on the eye.

Eurogame típico con tema pegado que pasa sin pena ni gloria. No añade nada especial más allá de la mecánica principal, el rondel, que por otra parte ya comparte con varios otros juegos y que a mi no me gusta especialmente. Los componentes son moderadamente vistosos, pero sin alardes.

Cumple su función correctamente, pero igual que Hamburgum podía ser Mipueblum. Tras un par de partidas resulta repetitivo, como la mayor parte de los Eurogames de tema pegado.

i saw a complaint about the looks recently, but i like that.  one play, london side.  i was cautiously optimistic due to what i'd heard, its play length, and the fact that i think the rondel is a decent mechanic.  i found the game fairly shallow, though, and thematically vapid despite outward appearance.  the boat mechanic was welcome, and i like the scarcity of certain actions as well as the increasing costs/decreasing payouts.  i don't have a whole lot of positive things to say about the play experience, though.  i think i might like it better with four players.  i think antike is still on the bottom of the rondel game list for now, mostly because of its dreadful endgame, but i like imperial a whole lot better than this.

Nálam veri a Navegadort, eddig ez a nyerő rondellások közül (bár egyelőre csak 2-t próbáltam)! Nagyon ritkán dob fel ennyire egy játék, végig pörgős, izgalmas volt. Teljesen eltérő taktikák feszültek egymásnak, tanulságos, hogy nem feltétlen elég a sok pénz. A végén nagyon sok (talán túl sok is) múlik az ütemezésen, ha az ember nyakán marad a sok fa és agyag, akkor akár 20-30 pontot is bukhat ahhoz képest, mintha neki sikerülne befejeznie a játékot. A Rondella neve akár dilemma is lehetne, jól megfogalmazná a lényeget. Bármikor játszom vele, nagyon jó. Kíváncsian várom a többi rondellást:)

A basic rondel game. Not the best one. Less development, more opportunistic. I prefer Antike and Navegador. I also think a more elegant market system escapes Gerdts for some time now. I advise you to prefer another Gerdts rondel game like imperial, antike or navegador.

This is without doubt the lightest of Mac Gerdts' rondel games, but is in no way less challenging that its most renowned brothers. It has a big plus in its capability to scale pretty well down to 2 players, becoming an efficiency race. It lacks the enticing theme and clever faction-control of Imperial, but it is anyway a pretty good game.

A totally different game with the rondel incorparated in an equally good fashion as in Imperial. Game is not very confrontational but still very competitive. The rondel really forces you to think about and plan your moves carefully from the first turn. Lots of different ways to victory. Can be a bit dry.

After the second play we realized it was just not an exiting game and it probably would not get played again due to this. Traded away

Played this at BGG.Con. I think Mac has taken a step backwards with the Rondel series. This is primarily because he has taken player interaction in the form of conflict out of the equation. I found the investment card aspect of Imperial to be an absolutely fascinating take on a game with war and combat in it. The fact that you can win by not engaging in combat was a pure genius move to accommodate more that one style of gamer.

In Hamburgum, Mac  eschews the cries of ATers and delivers cliche euro theme and classic euro non-confrontation. [more here soon about what you actually do in the game, typical cube exchange mechanics]

I predict that fans of Caylus, Goa and other pure Euro ilk will like Hamburgum the best out of the three in the rondel series, while ATers and those with mixed tastes will prefer the other two. Like the majority here at BGG, I'm a gamer with appreciation for both AT confrontation and theme and Euro subtlety and elegance. Imperial is still far and away my favorite of the three. Hamburgum is not bad though for a perfect information game.

The closest thing to a no-luck game I've played since chess.  So far, I love this game.  I thought replayability could be an issue and, while I'm not playing it a ton, it has remained very good over several plays.  I've now played with 3, 4 and 5 players.  It seems to work okay with any number, but I feel like 4 players is best then 5.  3 players is a bit weak.

I think Hamburgum provides a heavyish feel with approachable gameplay.  It feels like one of the better games for players to transition from light to medium/heavy Euros.

Pretty good but not great rondel game.  You can tell that this came out before Navegador as it feels a little less polished.  I do like the bit of freedom you have in the rondel in this one where trade can be used to get money OR spend money.

This game doesn't get the attention it deserves in my opinion.  Highly tactical, highly cutthroat.  I have only played it 2-P so far but want to play again.  The best part of the game is the components with real bells and bricks made of clay.

Notes:
-Do not focus on buying ships scoring markers, because the payout is very limited.  Buildings and citizens can be much more effective.
-Always keep a reserve of cash buy resources.
-Calculate the exact resources required before landing on the church space based on who else can use the church first.

The economy aspects of this game are very fun. Ships start at the top, more production means diminished values, only BUY or SELL but not both, etc. And the bits in this game are awe inspiring!  This game has plenty of depth, yet simple mechanics.  All the different types of victory multipliers leads to multiple paths to victory. And this is a game that rewards a player that doesn't spend his whole game working on his engine... I really really like this game.

Another of Mac Gerdts' patented "rondel" games. This one is more like Navegador than the others being primarily a trading/economic game. Here you are garnering "prestige" by helping to build six medieval churches in Hamburg (expansions let you do similar things in different cities).

As in Navegador, three commodities are produced and sold to fuel the economic engine. Ships figure in the puzzle but in a more abstract way here and determine how many goods can be sold during a trading phase.

The key ingredient in Hamburgum is planning your builds and choosing which rewards you will take from the donations you make to the various churches in order to maximize your prestige by the end. Of the two (Hamburgum and Navegador) I prefer Navegador.

It`s my favorite Rondel-game.
Nice economic game with good looking components. Direct interaction is low, but a lot of indirect can be found. Such which VP-tile I choose, how many steps of churches I build, which amount of ships to push theirs others out of the harbor. These kinds of subtile playoptions and the very low downtime is what I like for this game. Best with 5 Players as there is the most competition.

RATING: 10
This is a cleverly designed game that really emphasizes strategy. The gist of this strategic game is that players are wealthy merchants in the city of Hamburg (or alternatively, London) trying to gain prestige by donating to the construction of the city's major churches. There are many elements to the game. In order to have the supplies and money to donate to the churches, players have to build industry, accumulate goods, build ships, and sell what they make. But they can't focus too much on the trade aspect of the game, or else they will lose opportunities to donate before other players do. 

Each player has a token that the player moves between one and three spaces around a rondel, each space representing an activity that the player can perform; the affect of this is that a player can do one of only three particular activities during any turn, depending on where the player is on the rondel, and it makes players strategize about where they are positioned on the rondel relative to other players, considering what those other players might plan to do next. This also eliminates the element of chance, as there are no dice or luck of a drawn card involved. 

Because there are so many elements to the game, it can take a little while to learn all of the rules. However, the game play itself is rather easy because the players' available actions are controlled by their movement around the rondel.

Great first play of this game. I love that there are multiple strategic paths to take, but it's not a 'point salad' with eighteen different ways to score points. Played with five players, and it was fun but I think the game may shine with 3-4. Will be interesting to see how this fares on a replay.

04/03/2015: A bit of a shine taken off this second play. May just be the theme and artwork are so mediocre. Still fun though. Can't see this going up to an 8, but could potentially drop on further replays.

No, this isn't a game about McDonalds.  There is a remarkable amount of strategy in this game, yet since the game moves so fast if you're playing right that there is very little time to think.  There really is a ton of information to take in on each turn, and given little time and the need to plan a little ahead, this game rewards players who can think quickly.

Things to remember :

- can only acquire 1 Official during Guildhall action.
- may acquire a building anywhere on the map if you have completed a cathedral (master builder).

I hold a soft spot in my heart for this light strategy game because of the theme (I'm from Hamburg). As far as game play goes, each player best tries to maximize VP while doing the usual build-ship/sell-donate-score two-step. It went over well with my non-gaming parents. It's not however the first game I would suggest to play with my regular gaming friends.

RATING: 8
Excellent game. Very similar to Navegador--perhaps a bit [u]too[/u] similar, but fun nonetheless. The rondel adds such interesting timing decisions: it's much more costly to buy goods in bulk, but it's more time-efficent, and since you're all racing to get the donation tokens (and working to get presence on the board), you often don't have the luxury of making multiple purchases. Love the building and shipping bonuses, love the retro/campy look of the board, hate the really butt-ugly cover art.

This game proves the rondel can be used effectively in lighter games, too.  Fun, quick moving (as rondel games usually are), with relatively clear rules.  Watch how the bonus tiles score, and understand them before playing.  Enjoyable for exactly as long as the game lasts - but be aware the game picks up speed toward the end as everyone begins simply executing the timing on the strategies they have built to that point.

A functional and technically sound game design, but one I thought was pretty void of any excitement or interesting decisions. It just felt like I was continually cycling though a lot of the same things, without anything super exciting to work toward.

It was also a slightly frustrating game in that I spent like a lot of the game was simply waiting for your turn to come back around. There wasn't a lot of thinking to do when it wasn't your turn, as you often know what you want your next several actions to be, and other peoples' turns aren't all that interesting to watch either.

Overall, a solidly built game, but without any sort of soul. I wouldn't be super enthused to play it again.

Shorter than I expected it to be, which is good because it feels a little repetitive. It's got that get x, sell x to buy y, use y to get z, use z to get more x, etc. gameplay to it, which is infuriating to me. But I still thought this was short enough, and the Rondel does such a good job of keeping things moving that I didn't hate it. Hey Mac, got any other design ideas?

A good "lighter" economic game, with a touch of area control. While the rules are simple, the gameplay is elegant yet complex, with each mechanism intertwining on several levels. Would be a good stepping stone to either a more complex economic game like cuba (Puerto Rico or whaterver), or on to Antike. Components are top quality.

RATING: 3.5
This game features extremely repetitive action selections… Yes, I’m obviously not an expert after just a single play, but it seemed like you constantly needed to get some goods, trade them at the market for cash, then do something else, then go to the market and buy resources for the cash you earned, then donate to the church or build buildings… If you could sell and buy at the market during the same action I actually think I would like the game more. As it stands now, it’s definitely my least favorite rondel game! It doesn’t have those interesting decisions you make in Navegador, and there isn’t much variability and it feels extremely mechanical and repetitive which equals boring.

The worst part about it is probably that the game doesn’t speed up once you’re close to the end; you don’t have a bigger engine, you don’t get more income or anything else, so the game ends slowly without any satisfaction. Also, it seems that there are way too few paths to victory; every player basically does exactly the same all the time; in Navegador, you have at least a couple of very different strategies, but in Hamburgum there is basically only one strategy; you want to donate to the church, and in order to donate you need resources; resources you need to buy from the market for money you have earned for selling goods earlier in the game... And the 3 goods are almost exactly the same. The game honestly doesn’t allow for a whole lot of creativity and diversity from the players. 

I keep comparing it to Navegador, but in that game there’s the need to get to the market before your opponents and sell before they do in order to get the better prices, so you might be anxious about what your opponents are going to do. That’s (almost) not necessary in Hamburgum, except for the way the ships work, which is one of the only remotely interesting things in the game; the moving of the ships onwards in the three different ports is a cool mechanic, and you can get screwed and screw others if they/you decide to buy ships and move theirs off the board or onto the worse ports. This mechanic increases the spite and interaction, but the most interesting mechanic in Hamburgum is probably which buildings you build and where to build them (which, granted, also means that you have to be faster than your opponents; even moreso in 4-5p games I would guess). The various different buildings make the game much better than it would otherwise be.

Oh, I think I have to mention the components; it’s a nice touch that you get actual bells and bricks made of real bricks and not just cubes. But this doesn’t change the fact that this is a very poor game. As you can tell I don’t enjoy the game too much; it’s definitely a game which is a prime example of “JASE” – and this statement comes from a HUGE fan of eurogames!

Very solid rondel game; nothing much like Antike or Imperial.  More of a "standard" euro but with a Rondel.  It scales very well, but it's downside is that there can be a bit of kingmaking, and also, it has a somewhat lackluster endgame on occasion where you can tell what's going to happen but not do anything much.

This is a very nice game that moves along quite quickly. ie. very little down time. I like the rondel thingy and the way it works. The theme is unique and there seems to be many options. I won by a big margin and am now hopeing that there is not a sure way to win, the one I found, and not many ways to win. We will have to play this again and see. It will get played again as I like games like this. It is being compared to Puerto Rico due to the sales and production theme. It is fun, and somewhat loosely like PR, but not as good.

This is probably my least favorite of the eggert Rondel series.  It's not bad, I suppose, but there wasn't much tension for many of my decisions.  I can't put my finger on why.  The conflict is far more passive-aggressive than games like Imperial or Antike, which may have something to do with it.  I'll probably try it a few more times, but it didn't grab me all that much.

Bravo's competitive reality show 'Shear Genius' was nowhere near as good as Project Runway or even Top Chef, but it did have its moments. One of those moments was about a third of the way through the competition. In the previous elimination challenge, stylists were required to use nontraditional cutting tools for their haircuts. One contestant got stuck with a gigantic pair of hedge clippers and used them quite well, considering: her haircut wasn't exactly a precision job, but it looked really good. It worked!

Problem was, for the next challenge, she insisted on using them again. They worked for her last time, and by God, she was going to stick with those hedge clippers. Her fellow contestants rolled their eyes, but she used them well again. She kept going. For the next elimination challenge, the clippers came out. A few of her fellow stylists had had enough of her shenanigans by that point. There was all sorts of name-calling, everyone behaved like children, the hedge clipper girl did an awful job, the judges hated her, they were fed up with her clippers besides, and she got sent home.

I'm a little worried about hedge clipper syndrome here, and the 75 minute playing time is a huge red flag. But hopes are still high. Good luck, Mac!

I've played all 3 rondel games, and own them all. 

Hamburgum is significantly different from the other two, in that there is no combat. There is, however, a lot of player interaction. Spatial competition in builds, targeted depreciation of resources and manipulation of game tempo (in church builds) all can thwart your opponents' plans. If people are ignoring those things, they are not likely to do well against an experienced opponent.

I wish the resources and money didn't convert so tidily into prestige at the end. It feels a little too easy, although maybe otherwise the person who completes the last church gets too much benefit.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. It plays quickly, has fantastic components and has a unique feel to it. I'm not sure how much replay longevity there will be, but the game itself is very well done.

Thanks Secret Santa!

RATING: 5
Hamburgum is the third game in the ongoing Rondel series, and this time the game is a pure Euro. In this case, players are building churches and guild halls, producing goods, and trying to sell them for maximum profit. The scoring system here is chit driven...as you build churches you gain associated scoring tiles, which are then (or later) flipped over to score points based on your purchased guild halls, or your presence in the harbour (the harbour also driving how many goods you can sell at a time). 

The flow of the game was basically buy building materials, use materials to buy guild buildings which mean you can make more of a given resource, create that resource, sell that resource for money, use that money to buy more building materials, and so forth.

I think the game works well enough, but it felt a touch dry, and is not nearly as textured as Imperial, my current favourite Rondel driven game (and a game that I'm still not sold on either). The Rondel itself also could be contributing to this, because the flow in this game felt very patterned because of the way the Rondel is ordered. I understand that it restricts choices, and is actually decreasing the otherwise even more patterned play, but it still felt formulaic much of the time, which probably just means that I don't find the overall concept here interesting enough.

All of this said, the game works decently enough, but it didn't do anything that surprised or enchanted me either. Most of the decisions seemed fairly straight-forward, and there was no surprising twist to the system to really make me a fan of this particular variation.

This was one of my highlights of the BGG con. Right off the bat let me say that before I played it quite a number of people had mentioned they didn't like the roundel "Action Wheel" which was used in Imperial, Antike and another game which slips my mind at the moment. This almost put me off but after playing it I was so glad I did. The Roundel is a great mechanism that should be in more games. Hamburgum has so much going on that the Roundel is really such a small element. Not liking the Roundel is to me like saying I don't like games with cubes. But the key thing is this game has a nice balance of strategies to try.

Really like the rondel mechanic, it is better than dice or cards for determination of actions.  I like the resource management aspect of the game where you need to balance greed to build the church with getting money from your beer, cloth & sugar, or buying buildings at the guild hall.  The extra prestige points earned as you contribute to the church allows for multiple paths to victory.  The second board on the back which might have been an expansion in past years adds value to the game.  Playable by an 8-1/2 yr old.

RATING: 5
Played once during Spiel 2007. This game is (of course) the third in the series of Mac Gerdts's line of rondel games. Hamburgum is a luckless economic engine where the players attempt to buy the three most important trade goods of 17th century Hamburg at a low price, and then selling it high. The profits are turned over to the bane of humanity, organised religion, in order to finance the construction of various churches. These give points, but also function as the game's clock: as soon as all 6 have been built, the game ends.

I had high hopes for this game at the time it came out: Mac's designs had been quite playable for me until then. Unfortunately, the game proved to be problematic in several ways which stayed my hand in purchasing it. The most important issue I had with it is its token mechanic: the rondel. The more I play it, the more I'm beginning to think it resembles a stair with uneven steps. At some point in the game, you're locked in a certain playing rhytm, but the game simply won't let you take the strides you want. Instead, you are always obliged to insert a few minor steps in between because [i]not[/i] inserting them costs too many resources. Mac really ought to work on this sometime in the future. (Regrettably, he's done very little on this; even in the much better Navegador it is only a single action which revolves backward along the table.) The other genuine issue I had were the game's washed out colours which caused considerable confusion on my behalf and more than a few errors in picking up the correct building tiles. Game-wise, Hamburgum is at the time of writing my second favourite of the series, after Navegador. I think I like this game best of the three rondel games  This is because of the rather direct nature of the rondel's actions: whereas in Antike 'movement' can initiate enormous troop displacement, in Hamburgum 'buy beer' just means 'buy beer'. However, I fear that this simplicity will also eat into the game's longevity, so 'being best' might actually be a rather short-lived designation. It is of course purely guesswork on my part: you cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from just a single game. Nevertheless, I got the impression the game might be a bit more lenient in scaling with player number, and that is a bonus over Antike.

After my first game I spent many hours debating with my sweetheart whether we should buy this game, and although my current feeling is 'no', I might be persuaded (it isn't certain) if the price is right—say about 10 euros or so instead of the ridiculously high 40 which were asked at the time. I like simple economy games for they allow me to think what is best in getting the engine up and running, and that is reflected in my desire to get the game at a low price.

Of the rondel games, my 2nd favourite -- I prefer it to Antike (which I find a touch too simple), but I prefer the interplay of Imperial.  In some ways, this doesn't feel as much like a Rondel game as the other two.

And, I still haven't really figured out how it works... with both Antike and Imperial, I feel like I've got a clue, and I've got a plan, or a hope for a plan.  With this one, I really haven't integrated how it all fits together yet.

In Hamburgum, players guide the families of Hamburg in the pursuit of wealth and prestige. They produce beer, sugar, and cloth and ship these goods overseas. They compete over the best sites for their buildings and the best berths for their ships in the harbor. Ultimately, they vie for the most prestigious church donations, because neither gold nor goods but only prestige decides the final outcome.

Hamburgum is the first economic-only rondel game. It is probably the simplest of the group, and is mainly focused on efficiency and timing. Not a brainburner as Imperial, it manages to move at a faster pace w.r.t. Antike. The end-game is rather predictable, just like the moves on the rondel.

Very good example of no-conflict game.  Moves along quickly enough that it stays always interesting.  In fact, it is fast enough that it is surprising how little production there is.  In fact, the economy is super goofy all around.  The best result is for nobody to produce production buildings.  If somebody buys one, then everybody needs to buy one, and then the net result of selling is exactly the same.  So to make a go of production, one really needs to jump out and monopolize a resource quickly.  Which is why finishinga church is so important so you can paradrop your guys.  It really works well.

Players represent merchants of Hamburg or London, depending on which board you play.  Players take turns to advance their dobber around the rondel, taking the action at where they stop.  Actions are ... acquire stuff (beer, sugar, cloth), trade stuff (sell the beer, sugar, cloth, or buy building materials), buy ships, buy bits of church, or buy buildings.  It's all about being able to buy bits of church for long term reward, but in the meantime you have a bits and pieces game - bit of positional stuff, bit of shafting your opponents by playing with your ships, etc.  Fun game, works well, the turns fly buy due to the rondel mechanic.  To it's credit, it's very different from Antike (conquest) and Imperial (stock markets).  Good game.

I was in a non cathedral making mood when playing it, but I do remember liking something about it.  So my rating is based on a biased opinion against building cathedrals.  I do remember approaching it with an open mind so I don't know.  Oh yeah the rondel thing.  I loved Imperial so the game had a lot to live up to for me.  Quit reading this comment.  I'm drunk.

Another incredible Rondel game.

RATING: N/A
I've played Navegador and fell in love with the Rondel System. Bought this game because would like to own another Rondel game, and this one in particular has zero luck.

[b][FirstImpressionPlayedOn27thSept2014][/b] Pulled it out to the table after owning the game for almost 3 years. I knew it's the easiest in the rondel series but I wasn't expecting it to be too simple. The first halves of the game was a little slow paced, not to my liking actually because it seems repetitive. 

Everybody seem to use the same strategy - gather wealth, use it to buy as many building materials as possible and then make 5 donations in one shot in a single church action. It seems pointless to donate half-way (based on early play) and letting other players finish the job with the remaining donations.

I still think there's a better strategy to discover here, so probably will try one more time.

The rondel strikes for the 3rd time. My favourite rondel is Imperial, but Hamburgum's rondel is better than Antike. 

The theme is well fit, but lack's some kind of player confrontation.

After one play didn't get the whole idea. To repeat soon.

Excellent Rondel game.  Money is tight, and there are too many things you need to do .  Always.   And it looks lovely.  The interesting path-mechanism on the board is made redundant after you have built a Church, which is a shame.  Perhaps needs better integration of rule and board on that matter.

Recent purchase. Haven't played yet. Looking forward to my first game.

Played for the first time. Very enjoyable game. I like the series as a whole. Mechanics are very interesting.

Played it for a second time. This time we played with the right rules. We learned that we did some things wrong the first time when we did the scoring of some the tiles. It truly changes. Both games was very different because of it. Not for the the better I think.

Drop the rating from an 8 to a 7.

Interesting resource-management game. I look forward to playing it again.

Played a prototype.

Played final version. I like the way the boats work now; much better than the prototype. I found, as before, that it's very hard to plan significantly ahead and that I often was hurt seemingly randomly because I had failed to predict what another player would do. I may just have been playing too aggressively. I'll try this one again.

RATING: 7
Initial rating after one play. After having spent some time with Antike (a favorite of my 13-year old son), I expected more of the same. What I got was a cleaner, tighter, quicker game. Broader range of scoring than Antike, but less fiddly without the direct conflict. Three rounds into it and we all knew what was up. One game is all that's needed to understand the strategy potential and prevent a runaway leader. Some have said that the theme is dull, but it didn't put us off a bit.

RATING: 5.83
Mildly interesting game with lots of beautiful bits, but seems to drag toward the end.  I suspect that playing to "completed churches = number of players" instead of to "completed churches = 6" to speed up the game and to add tension.  It might also increase interest in the game if the bonus tiles for church donations (except the 5 PP token) were set up inverted, and, when chosen, remained inverted in a player's play area until scored.  This game suffers a bit from having only one efficient method for earning victory points; it lacks the multiple paths to victory available in some other games, e.g. Puerto Rico.  Rating is a composite of my rating, my wife's rating, and my sister's rating (6, 6.5, and 5 respectively.)

RATING: 6
You're playing to acquire bonus tiles from different city churches. All the churches have the same 1x, 4x, etc. multipliers on their bonus tiles. 

The hook here is each church has a different condition for their 1x, 4x, etc. multiplier tile. So, you want to decide ahead of time which multiplier you want to maximize then chase getting those particular bonus tiles. 

The hard part is that blocking on the board is severe and you can get locked out of an area where you need presence to, ya know, score those bonus tiles you worked so hard to acquire.

I found it just OK. Felt like there were a half dozen substantial decisions in the game to make plans -- go get influence in this church, build this building, etc. -- and then you spent several turns executing your plan with near mindless actions: sell to get money, buy resources, achieve goal. Repeat for next selected plan. Of course, that makes those plans super important and that's the ostensible fun.

My favorite at BGG.Con '08.

I love rondel games. The mechanism seems to keep turn time limited to a minute at the most. (When you take goods like beer or cloth your turn lasts about 5 seconds.) This game takes all the goodness of Antike and Imperial and shifts it out of the realm of war and into a trading/building theme. And I was surprised to discover that the game works beautifully.

Of course, I played with 3 people who were always quick and seemed to grasp the rules (not that they're too tough to pick up) so we didn't slow down on piddly crap and there was no player paralysis.

[3 plays] Great shorter rondel game.  After a few plays I decided I really didn't need it in my collection for these reasons:  One, I spent too much of the game thinking about my next 6,7,8 turns on the rondel.  I hate that much direct calculation.  Two, it felt a bit like a push your luck game in that you needed to get buildings in the beginning to be the most efficient, but if you waited too long, you could miss the bonus tile you really need.  I don't like push your luck elements in heavier games.  Three, the theme just didn't do it for me once I got over the beautiful bits.  I'll still play it anytime as I would any rondel game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game avoids making the 8 because I am uncertain about a few things.  The rondel works well as it even seems worth exploiting it at the cost of prestige as one tactic to attain your goals; however it seems to me this does little to relieve the processional nature of most of the rest of the game.  An important caveat I must make, having said that, is that I really have to play more in order to see how diverse and/or effective the different approaches really are.  Clearly the timing of scoring is vitally important, but at the same time it seems rather obvious when the best time to score is (as late as possible).  The components are of the usual expected high quality.  The choice of boards to play on is also a plus.

Resource management meets the rondel. Both walk away unimpressed.

In Hamburgum, players trade in various goods in order to donate the profits to the church which earns victory points. What sounds primarily like a resource management game then turns out to be much more of a race. In many ways, it's beneficial if you can get things done just a bit faster than your opponents: Goods can be sold at higher prices before new production buildings are constructed, you can choose the best VP chits when donating to the church, and you can cordon off entire areas of the board if you construct early and often.

Yet despite these factors and the rondel that, of course, makes timing even more crucial and puts a spoke in your wheel at every most inopportune moment, the game lacks tension. The hodgepodge of different ideas begins to feel repetitive very quickly, and you're using the same few rondel spaces all the time. This gets even worse when the endgame approaches, as many of the options have already been exhausted, but players actually earn less money than before drawing it out much longer than necessary.

This designers games have components that seem to border on deluxe, are fun to handle the during play, and this one was different enough from Machu Pichu and Concordia to own. Lighter than the other two, but not by much.  I hope the arc of Hamburgum, Machu Pichu, and Concordia continues so we can have another euro treat from this designer.  Please keep the big chunky wooden components and the attention to history.  I adore these productions.

Pretty complicated game that is accessible to non-gamers because of the rondel mechanism - you see at the first glance what you can do and what others can. Plays in under 90 minutes and is pretty tense so if you like competition in games (but only a bit of negative interaction) try this one. It's really good.

Interesting economic engine/efficiency game. The rondel is certainly an efficient game mechanism, used to good effect here.  Not sure quite what what it simulates in the real world, but it works. Particularly like the cross-interaction of VP-gathering donations that need buildings, and the uses for buildings in and of themselves for production as well as VPs.  And lovely bits.  Played wtih 5, 1st game ~2 hrs, should be able to get nearer 1 hour.

Excellent rondel euro game - gather resources and convert to VP - most efficient player wins. Everything is clearly laid out on the baord so playing is a breeze. Competition for VP is intense so players will be bumping into each oter all the time. Very good!

Oh rondel games!  A groovy mechanic.  I enjoyed this game and there are plenty of good elements about it that are pretty interesting.  At the same time, maybe it was a little too euro-dry for me?  I can't decide.  I liked certain elements of the game but there are other things I was a little ho-hum about.  It's a solid game but maybe it felt a little more like other games I have played before...

You're in Hamburg of the 18th century and you're taking part in building churches and gain points (prestige) by making donations to them. So you'll need clay, wood and bells to allow the churches to be built. But where do you get the money for all this?

In the city you need to trade goods, beer, cloth and sugar, buy it on local markets and ship it on your ships as exported goods. If you want to obtain more goods, you need to help local folks build breweries, cloth factories and sugar mills and spread your presence in the city. 

The person who manages all that will gain most prestige points and win the game. Awesome theme and lovely play.

2008-11-10 - another mac gerdts rondel game, which is a good thing in my book.  haven't played Antike, but I've enjoyed both this and imperial.  the rondel is a clean and unobtrusive way to manage the different actions players can take.  Most turns are very quick, so the game moves along at a good clip as long as everyone is on top of it.  Not too much AP as each turn it's easy to choose best action, though you want to plan a few actions in advance The resource management can cause turns to slow down towards the end, but the game timer (the church tiles) start getting snatched up in the end game so things wrap up pretty quickly.  I like the way the game transitions from a focus on building to contributing to churches at the end.  There is a race aspect to the game as you try to beat your opponents to items that everyone is collecting, giving you a sense of urgency to your planning. 

2008-03-01 - got in a third play at home with my wife and two friends.  Game took about 4 hours to play (a little AP and a many interruptions.  Game was close throughout, but everyone passed me by on the final scoring.  Still had a great time.  raising to an 8.  I sure suck at this game.

Another McRondel game and another good one. While this is a good game, it can´t catch up with (for example) Antike, as you can´t change anything in the game. You cannot take over the buildings or something like that.
What you do is getting ressources, selling them to get the money you need to buy end-products which you need to build the churches, which lets you take tiles, that are needed for scoring. So, one big chain with nearly no interaction.

My first experience of a rondel game and an immediate hit. Only played two-player so far, but it's one that Zoe and me have been really competitive at since day one so is always great to play. Control via the rondel is really tricky and I love the fact you've always got the option to splurge a lot of cash to do what you like, if you really have to. The theme is a bit dull, and the box art terrible, but the components and board are brilliant.

Rondel game, so luck-free, but there's enough of interest racing to capture gift tokens for points and at the same time optimize an income-generating machine that it's definitely more interesting than Antike.

SWAG based on (1) solo play says: 7.25.  Good game, and I expect I'll get more repeat interest based on theme, etc.

Bought for 8 quid in The Works - Bargain!

Very keen to test it out, it looks great and is made by one of my favourite designers

Played it. Lots of tough decisions, I can see it would be better with 4+ players as I only played with 2. Need a couple more plays to really fully get it.

Played a couple of times with 4/5 now - compared with most games this would be ok, compared with Mac Gertds other games it's poor. 6.5 overall

Keen to try the advanced variant

After this, the third outing for the rondel mechanism, I guess I'm just not a big fan of rondel games. There's no direct conflict here, and the game falls into such a pre-programmed pattern (get resources, trade for cash, trade for wood/brick, donate or build) that you can find yourself following another player to the same rondel spaces over and over again. Let's give the rondel idea a rest now, please.

More cohesive than Imperial and may I say more fun? Reading the board is much easier and there are plenty of things to do.  It is not at all obvious who is winning unless you do the math and your options do not decrease over the course of the game as much as they appear to. (1 play)

1st played 01/31/08. Taught in ~25min, played in ~75min for 4 players. Good luck/strategy balance. Game actions: Harvest (1 of beer, sugar or cloth), trade (buy materials brick, wood, bell [max 1 in possession] / sell harvest goods), dockyard (purchase ship(s) to sell goods), guild hall (purchase buildings adj to own church donation or building for VPs, $, better future production), & church (donation to build the church for VPs & place disc for each of 5 sections built). Each player chooses to start at any location on the "Rondel" & starts w/ 1 good of each, brick, wood, ship, $, & VPs. ($ & VPs depends on starting position). Players circle around the "R" stopping at each location they like. You advance 1-3 spaces for free and pay 1VP for each additional move. The ships reside in a "berth" which can sell 1-3 packages depending on which of the 3 "B"s it's in. Once the 3-"B" is full (based on player #), ships are moved to the 2-B. Selling $ is based on demand (starting w/ $100 per & reduce by $10 each of same building built). Finishing a church gains your more VPs. The game ends when the 6th church is built. Count up VPs with goods & materials worth $50 and $100=1VP. Recommend borrow and purchase consideration.

Nov08: Well, I took my sweet time getting around to playing this one.  What did I think?  Well let's break it down:

PROS:
1. Very little downtime.  Turns went really fast and game clocked in under 90 minutes.
2. Decisions were tough with plenty of trade offs.
3. You could plan ahead a good 5-10 minutes at a time.

CONS:
1. A little shallow.  There weren't *that* many things to do.  Make money and build churches.
2. I broke away from the pack, de-synced my rondel, and still felt like I was doing the same stuff as everyone else.
3. There aren't *that* many ways to score.  The boat multiplier is about the only unique score.  The rest are just "have buildings concentrated around something".  How exciting.

So overall, not a bad game.  I don't think I need to own it, but I wouldn't turn it down given the option.  It's all about efficiency, without much chrome surrounding it.

Played with 3, 4 and 5 players. Hamburgum is as solid a game as Imperial, though the theme is a little less interesting. The use of the rondel and the complete absence of chance are what make this game, like it predecessor, particularly attractive for me. Furthermore Hamburgum has excellent components, the rules are clear and game play uncomplicated, and scoring appears to be balanced. Player interaction is subtle but important.

Solid game.  The best (along with Imperial) of rondel games.  Navegador is just a poor follow-up...

BUT... Hamburgum - exactly like Imperial - has serious problems with the no. of players.  Imperial is basically playable only with 4 players (despite the declared range 2-6) and Hamburgum... too! (despite the declared range 2-5).

With 5 it's too crowdy and you have very limited control.  End of the game happens too quickly and it's not quite possible to execute conscious, well-developed strategy. 
 With 3 you have plenty of control, BUT - paradoxally - the game drags (up to 3h!).  There is no rush to make donations/build churches, so the game goes on and on and on...
With 3 (and 2 players) there is also too much of room.

4 players is the happy middle-ground, but... having the 2-5 players game playable only with 4 makes made me thinking...

Sold, eventually.

Yawwwnnn.  Yes it was a bore. I mean, had I played it 200 games ago I'm sure my opinion would be a little more positive but now, ahh no. 

Very little luck from what I remember but quite dry and ultimately boring, people were waiting for the game to end. I love the Rondel but here it feels very mechanical and repetitive. The game moves fast thanks to the Rondel, it is low on interaction, it's another "doesn't do anything really wrong but nothing really right either," game.

Buy/sell, buy/sell, buy/sell, too many other good games like Brass, Agricola or many others around to play this, good for pure euro lovers maybe who don't like conflict and own 100 games or less. I would much rather play Antike anyday, more variability and more interaction, more paths too I believe, haven't actually played imperial yet to compare but it sure sounds better. Love the bits especially the bricks which actually feel like little bricks!

This game is part of the rondel series, but one of the lighter ones (not as heavy as Navegador, for example).  It's an engine building, resource management game, with some area control and route building.  It's lots of fun, timing matters a lot, and it plays pretty quickly once everyone knows what they're doing.  I like it a lot.

the second game was really interesting, I am considering a better rating. the production quality is disappointing tough. some parts of the design look very good (the buildings and the map) others are ugly. the bells are nice, but the back of the tiles are slipped: women are headless, the english text on the buildings are not always readable, because their illustration is not properly positioned.

RATING: 6
Solid, well-designed euro about church-building in Hamburg. Players represent wealthy citizens in Hamburg who get VP by donating to six different churches. Donations cost money, and money is earned primarily by producing and selling goods.

Based on three plays, I like Hamburgum, but I am not blown away. The rondel mechanism annoys me, since it limits my choices in arbitrary and irritating ways, and since it also seems to force my choices along certain lines. Turns pass quickly, but that's mostly because each of your turns usually consist of very limited actions ("Get two beer. Next").

So, for now a somewhat lukewarm rating of 7 from me. It's a game I think I ought to like and it may win more favor with me with more plays, but for now I can't help feeling slightly disappointed.

I have to be honest, I really love the Rondel mechanic. It is a [b]very[/b] cool way to flow the game and help limit AP and down time. You must time things and that brings a lot of tension. 

I like that you can pay to grind the Rondel move down a spot or two (I forget the limit you can change) if you realize you need to correct your timing.

I'm strongly thinking of picking up all 3 Rondel games, but I've held off for a bit.

My first--and only--play of this to date was the 2007 Geek Con in Dallas. It was very late, the night before leaving, I was very sick and had 10 gallons of cold medicine liquid in my system and a few cold pills to plug the dam and hold it all in. My buddy Jonathan passed by and later told me I looked like a complete zombie and the waking dead.

I was in first place in the end game, but I became completely convinced I [b]had[/b] to finish this one church and that was a complete mistake...I just needed to follow my course and invest in other churches as I wound down the game....Jorge and I hung heads at my choice of play:

I finished the church.

I lost.

:)

Much thanks to Songlian for teaching us late at night and on vague memories, much thanks to Koldfoot and the guys (I've completely blanked on the names!) for letting me sit in.

I can't rate it off of the one play, but it was very solid. You must watch board position, point position, and Rondel position. Shipping goods and making beer.

Very smooth playing.

After one play, I was unimpressed.

Imperial, by the same designer, was one of my favourites from last year.  It was tense and exciting... this game seems to be repetitive and boring.  Its only redeeming feature is that it plays fairly fast, so you don't have to endure the boredom for very long.

I am going to play again, with the hope of finding 'something I missed,' but first impressions are hard to shake... and this game totally missed the mark for me.  I think that I'm being generous giving it a '5.'

Addendum:  After playing the game with a full five players, I've decided to bump my rating to a '6.'  It's still a little bit of a chore, but with a full table of players, it's much more bearable.  I doubt that I'll ever play the game again with less than 5.

Produce goods. Sell them. Buy resources. Donate them to churches to collect scoring multipliers in 4 categories. (throws hands in the air) Game! Seriously, though, this is a solid entry in the resource management genre. The rondel is effective and the components are top, top notch. The purchasing model escalates in price similar to how Amun-Re works, making efficient purchasing more costly. The building limitations set by the board seem minimal almost to pointlessness. I do enjoy playing the game, but there is one aspect of scoring that bothers me: the uneven value of the tiles. Scoring tiles seem to fall into two categories: fat (25-30 points near the game's end) and skinny (0-12 points). Because the fat tiles are often worth 2-4 times the skinny tiles, it feels like whoever can secure a fat tile advantage is going to win (with both large end-game points and by preventing others from claiming them). Each tile costs exactly the same resources to secure, so it's not like you have to work any harder to get the larger points, it tends to boil down to simple timing. I like the timing aspect of the rondel games, but I feel it is almost too dominant a factor in this one.

Played once (two players on London map), initial impressions good. Preliminary rating around 8, but would like to play again before rating.
Update: Played a second game on the Hamburg map (again with two players) and still liked it, but would be interested in playing with more than 2.
Update: Have played some more times with various number of players and like it a lot. The Rondel mechanism works really well in the game I feel, as it means there's hardly any downtime, while there still is quite a bit to think about. Probably my favourite of Gerdts' three Rondel games.

RATING: 6
Hamburgum fuses tried-and-true resource management with the designer's signature Rondel mechanism. So, in ~16th century Hamburg, the city's prominent merchants build up a trade in beer, sugar, and cloth. As production volume grows, the sale value of these goods drops. But, as you make more money per sale, you can handle bigger purchases of various building materials at market, which in turn grow the production base. There's a network consideration on the board, which means you're in a rush to claim certain locations first. There's a trading capacity represented by ships in the harbor, and these slowly become obsolete over the course of the game. And then there's the central goal of the game, which is to donate materials to the various churches in Hamburg, in return for which you get various scoring tiles. Again, there is a race to get the ones you want.

Rondel games are all about timing, and Hamburgum is no exception. Certainly you need to get your buy/sell volume to high levels quickly, but other than that this game is all about when you do stuff and if other players manage to do it first. As a result, I don't think it will hold up particularly well after one or two more plays. So many better resource/building games out there.

Update: following a second play with three, I'm not sure what to think about this game. I really want to like it, both conceptually and based on the components. But something about it doesn't seem to work for me. I'm not sure how well matched the Rondel is to this style of resource game. Playing is a very strange experience. Turns are simple, but planning short sequences of them is not. The theme and atmosphere are great, but the game doesn't back them up with a robust sense of options. Mechanically, the game is a constant recalibration of your timing. I don't think that meshes well with the usual attractions of resource play. 

Letdown. I want to like it, but I don't think if has much to offer me.

Gets rather repetitive.
Get commodities; sell commodities; build stuff.
Get commodities; sell commodities; build stuff.
Get commodities; sell commodities; build stuff.

The game pretends to escalate but it really doesn't.  You build up an infrastructure to take more commodities in a turn, but the value continually drops.  Since the number of commodities you can sell in a turn remains generally stable, this means that your revenue actually tends to go down, while the cost of things goes up.

It outwears its welcome.  We find that in time the board becomes filled, choices narrow, and the cycle just gets tighter and more programmed.

My personal ranking of rondel games: 
1. Imperial 
2. Imperial 2030
3. Navegador
4. Hamburgum
5. Antike
Hamburgum suffers in direct comparison to Navegador. Without Navegador it would have its spot as the economic version for conflict averse rounds. But Navegador fills the same spot in a smoother and more interactive way making Hamburgum almost superfluous. The rondel actions in Hamburgum are not as balanced leaving a sense of a need for further refinement. The game is more a tactical game of being a step ahead in the race to grab something first than one of different strategies competing against each other. The end is anti-climactic as costs rise while revenues decrease. It's a good game nonetheless but it loses at least one rating point to its newer brother. Also, the art of the box and the components is hideous while at least the board in Navegador is fantastic.

This game is obviously derivative, right down to its stereotyped Euro box front. Most obviously, it apes Puerto Rico's roles and economics model. It also uses a rondel, which artificially limits actions even more severely and artificially than does PR. So why do I like it so much? It's significantly lighter than advertised here on the 'Geek, and it really probably could be played down to an hour. Apart from the lame commodity blocks--green cubes for fabric? are they wearing felt?--the components are really well done, down to the church bells and simulated bricks. The double-sided board is a plus, allowing for greater replayability. Gameplay is quick and not too brain burning, which I generally appreciate. Ultimately, the game is more constricted than maybe some others, like PR, in that rather than truly having many routes to success, all of the routes in Hamburgum revolve around donating to churches. You could focus on trade, for example, but money's only a means to an end in this game, not an end in itself. Still, within those parameters, there are a lot of turn-to-turn decisions to make and some control over your actions. Not too taxing, but I'm looking foward to another play.

After playing Hamburgum, I realized that I appreciate the lack of direct military conflict, which is probably what bothered me about Antike and Imperial.  I still want to try Imperial a few more times because the stock system intrigues me, but I don't really care for Antike.  I also appreciate the quick play time of Hamburgum.  The theme is very humdrum and the artwork is awful (as was Imperial), but the rondel creates a very fast moving game that I am interested in pursuing further.

The mechanics and lack of random elements really should've left this one feeling dry and dull.  Instead, it's now a new favorite in my home that inspires some stiff competition.  One of my biggest surprises of 2009, and an excellent addition to the collection.

Update 10/10/09:

With two players, I'm starting to notice a trend.  It would seem that winning is based on early completion of a church (for the bonus VPs) and a few of the donation tiles.  Right now, I'm curious as to what strategies, if any, could counter that.

RATING: 8
Very good resource management game without combat and without luck, but with the rondel to determine the possible actions. The components are very good (real bells! and they even ring!). Goal of the game is to build churches which generates victory points. While it is useful to build houses early in the game, make sure to also donate for the churches or the donation tokens you need might have gone already ... Also don't overbuild, because having too many houses will make it harder to pay for the last donation to finish a church.

City building game with rondel mechanic. Players produce and sell things to get building materials to be donated to the churches. Comes along with 2-sided board and mini historical book about the game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good eurogame.
The rondel helps people with AP because they are "limited" to only three actions.
Infact you are not but for a huge part of the game I don't think paying VP is in order.
Anyway all actions are very very straightforward.
We still managed to fill 2 hours for our first game easily but when it hits the table again this will be shortened.



7.5 rating can be bettered but I think we have to play the advanced version.

Having read the comments on the other rondel numerous times I think I will like them more and because I like this enough these are on my future shoppinglist.

Also ordered Lisbao expansion for this one.

Quite reminiscent of Navegador with its rondel, market, indirect player interaction, etc.  A bit less economic and a bit more abstract with some area control thrown in, Hamburgum still pulls its weight and should be closer in ranking to Navegador (which I think is a bit overrated).  Not stellar but very playable.

I don't believe that the rondel is one of my favorite mechanisms and it is starting to feel like its played out its welcome.  The game has some interesting tweaks as you have several different ways to score points in building cathedrals and taking different types of scoring tiles.

Certainly another great game, as I continue to love the Rondel. This one is totally different, being a more building and majorities game with special scorings smattered throughout. It's amazing how the same mechanism, and even slightly different takes on the same base concepts serve up a totally new experience. Very brain melty to boot. Will certainly rise in rating with more plays.

Another solid performance from Mac Gerdts.  I've only played this game 5-player, and since I one, perhaps it slants my thinking about whether the game is too brutal for 5... it's possible 1 or 2 in a 5 player game will get completely hosed too early to have much fun the rest of the time.  But I'm not sure about that.  I've never seen a game with so much complexity play so fast.  Yeah for the rondel!!!  Fantastic bits to the game, so-so mapboard... some of the information design is a little funky, and the board is very busy without a place for the eye to rest.

An okay game.  The graphic design isn't to my taste, a little too busy, and the rules aren't as clear as they should be.  In our first game we played about halfway through before we decided to start over because of a major rules misunderstanding, and we still made a couple of mistakes in the full game.

Second play with 5 players was not enjoyable.  The board gets too crowded too quickly.  I think one player only built 2 buildings before being blocked out of everything else.

Received as a Secret Santa gift 2008

After a couple of solo plays I managed to get Hamburgum to the table on May 5, 2009 (!)

I was hoping for a bit deeper play than what it turned out being but maybe the depth is subtle and comes through only after a few plays. I greatly enjoyed the quick play, relatively little down time, and with three we were done very quickly.  For a game with zero randomness it was not overly heady.

The Rondel is great, of course, but it didn't quite hold the tension I'd hoped. I thought there'd be a bit more "should I race around quickly" or "do I have time to stop a few times on the way".

I'm looking forward to many more plays and rank it highly even after just one [real] play.

Update 2: After the third game I feel much better. The game builds up to a climax, there seems to be several ways to take off, and with reasonably quick players the 90 minutes are enjoyable.

Update 1: After two plays, I´m not sure what to think of this game. I really like the simple turn sequence, and the bits are great, and there are interesting decisions each turn. Perhaps it´s been a little slow with five, because most of the time you immediately know what you want to do next turn. Looking forward to playing again, perhaps with 4.

Mac Gerdts is come one of my favourite designer. One thing that I like lots of his games is, of course they are fantastic euro games with minium luck, that they had theme. That little booklet where Mac told backrounds of theme of his game. That reminds me of one other great designer Martin Wallace.

To me this one little thing explain why player donate building materials and money to those six churches. Why player produce beer, clothes and sugar. That is thing that brings soul to game.

Honestly Hamburgum is least-good Rondel series game that I had played (Princes of Machu Pichu game that in hadn't played) but still is it good game. And it is not bad thing to be last in good series.

roundel game of action choosing.  Theme is building churches and surrounding buildings.  Need to get goods to sell to buy resources to build various buildings or make donations to help build a church.  Multiple ways to score victory points makes it appear that there are several ways to try to win.

Nice bits, but the map can be somewhat confusing at times as to where a particular building site lies.

This is definitely the game I am most excited about from Essen (next to Tribune from Karl-Heinz Schmeil)... First of all - the box artwork is not pretty.  I don't like it at all.  The mapboard building locations are color coded which is excellent, but the writing is awfully small and hard to read even when sitting close to the board.  I finally tried it and enjoyed it very much.  The game has a lot going on but it doesn't feel too heavy.  Perhaps after Imperial I was looking for something a bit heavier?  Players should be able to plan out their moves in advance for minimal downtime.  Even so turns go by at a brisk pace.  I guess it just depends on who is playing.The one game we played left everyone guessing who would win.  Player interaction is subtle in this game.  You can definitely do things to mess up your opponents but it isn't blatant as it is compared to a game of El Grande.  The rondel creates a wonderful tension.  A solid game and I hope to play again soon. BTW, I think I still prefer Imperial; that game is extremely elegant for a heavier design. But I am sure you could complete Hamburgum in approx 1 hr with a group of veterans.  That would be extremely difficult to do with Imperial.

Played a second time and I found the lack of direct player interaction somewhat bothered me... It doesn't for many other games so I am not sure why it is such a sore spot on this game?  I lowered my rating by a point to compensate.

Yet another rondel-game. This one is very interesting as well. However, the rondel hinders you in choosing your actions as not all of them are within affordable reach. I prefer games that offer a player total freedom of what to do, E&T for instance. The simplicity of the rondel gives you only a few reasonable options, so at least there is very little downtime.

Score of 8 after one play. There's a lot going on here but it's fairly simple to pick up (I say that after coming in third!). It's all about timing and about church building. I have to remember that; when a game's about church building, you should build the church more and not just horde tons of cash and goods.Anyway, this seems to be a very good game. We did get one rule wrong with a scoring chit for the cathedral with no area (forget the name), but other than that it runs pretty smoothly. I look forward to playing again.

Update: Had a four and a five player game. I did a little better on the 5-player, but I think it's a little better with 4. The downtime isn't that bad, but it seems to slow when you have a few actions where you just collect cubes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good solid game, seemed better on the one time I've played 3 player than the 4 player ones. Less down time and more control of your own destiny. No sign of a 'perfect plan' but zillions of 'doh!' moments, due to the Rondel.

AFTER A COUPLE OF FAUX PAS WITH THE RULES IN THE 1ST GAME PLAYED, PLAYED 
CORRECTLY IN THE 2ND.  EXTREMELY ENJOYABLE ( I AM A BIG,BIG FAN OF THE RONDEL ) NOT QUITE AS DEEP AS IMPERIAL ( A GAME I RATE VERY HIGHLY ), BUT IT DOES INVOLVE PLENTY OF TACTICAL CHOICE. IE: HOW MUCH TO BUY OF DONATION TILES VERSUS BUILDINGS, TO ENHANCE ONES OWN SCORE, & ALSO CAREFUL PROCUREMENT OF SAID TILES & BUILDINGS TO PREVENT OTHER PLAYERS PROFITING FROM THEM.   THROW IN TRYING TO USE THE RONDEL AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE.

Germán. Ez a legjobb szó rá: jó értelemben vett puritán, Hamburgban játszódik, gémer, robosztus, masszív anyaghasználattal (nagyméretű tábla, fa komponensek, vastag lapkák).

A rondellák mesterétől, Gerdtstől ez az első játék, amit próbáltam. Röviden: nem rossz, de hiányzott belőle az a plusz, ami miatt alapjátékká válhatna nálam. De nézzük sorban!

A rondellás akcióválasztás tényleg rendben van, bár itt izgalmasabb lett volna, ha csak egy jelölő van, amit mindenki használ, sokkal jobban lehetne taktikázni, a másikkal kiszúrni, több interakció, stb. Merthogy mindenkinek külön akció jelölője van, amit körbeléptet a rondellán (3 lépésig ingyenes, utána lépésenként -1 pont).

Az akciók:
 - termelés: sör-posztó-cukor hármasból alapesetben jár egy-egy (tökmindegy, hogy a sör, a cukor, vagy a posztó mezőre lépünk, ugyanúgy járnak a nyersanyagok, csak gondolom így színesebb lett a kerék, de ne tévesszen meg senkit), illetve ha van adott épületünk - sörfőzde, takácsműhely vagy cukorfinomító -, akkor abból a termékből épületenként még kapunk 1-1 db-ot
 - kereskedés: kétféle akció választható (vagy-vagy), az egyiknél eladhatunk a hajóink pozícióinak megfelelő mennyiségű terméket, a másiknál pedig nyersanyagot vásárolhatunk (fát és téglát, esetleg harangot)
 - építkezés: épületeket húzhatunk fel a szomszédos mezőkre (épületenként 1-1 fába és téglába kerül a mutatvány), amik vagy termelő épületek vagy valami más bónuszt adnak (érdemes játék előtt megismerkedni velük, hogy ne az első játéknál kelljen fél órát agyalni, hogy melyikkel járunk jobban)
 - hajóépítés: egy fáért egy hajót építhetünk, ami a kikötőbe kerül (kereskedelmi kapacitásunk növelhető vele, viszont figyeljünk arra is, hogy milyen hatással van a többi hajónkra, ha odébb úsztatjuk őket)
 - templom támogatás (vagy egyszerűen csak építés): minden templom öt szint alatt épül fel, különböző bónuszlapkákat adva, amik győzelmi pontokra válthatók -> ergo ezek nélkül nem nagyon lehet nyerni

Jól tervezhető, korrekt nyersanyag-menedzsment, de valahogy túl egyszerűnek éreztem. Igaz, két fős játék volt az első és többen valószínűleg jobb móka, de így olyan száraz volt, mint a sivatagi róka megpörkölt farokvége.

Értem én, miért szeretik annyian annyira, de nem jött át az a plusz, amire számítottam. Jó iparosmunkának tűnik, de semmi több.

I love Mac Gerdts' clever rondel system. He proves that it works just as well in Hamburgum's economic setting as it does in his Imperial and Antike military settings.  The tension really builds in this game as you always have so many things you are trying to do at once.  It always seems that you are just one turn behind the other guy. And it never hurts that the components are top notch.

Seemed decent enough, although I didn't really like the theme or the visual style (some of it was actually pretty ugly). So it's a bit bland. The rondel mechanic felt like it favours the starting player too much, despite the fewer starting points & money (which are basically insignificant).

It might feel likes a mix of many euro mechanics, but the use of rondel is clever in that you can plan a few turns ahead, reducing the downtime and luck. Game play is quite streamlined, and tension exists because everything in the game has to be fighted for in terms of scarcity and time. It's not spectacular, but it has done its job right.

This is Mac Gerdt's third game using his "Rondel" system. In 17th century Germany, one is competing to construct churches. The available actions on the rondel are produce sugar, produce beer, produce cloth, trade, donate to a church, build ships or construct buildings. Goods can be traded in for money, and the quantity of goods that can be traded depend on where a player's ships are located. Building materials can be purchased on the trade action of the rondel. You may purchase more materials (wood, brick or bells), at the cost of more money. Donations to a church give one VP chits, with some counting citizens, ships, donation tiles, or buildings. The game ends when all churches have been completed. I think this is probably the best game out of the three rondel games. The other two, wargamers enjoy, and I am not a wargamer. It will take a few more plays to understand the nuances of this game, but it is a fun econonmic system, with room for tactics, for instance, when one tries to score their ship points.

You might think that the simplicity of the rondel would lend itself better to a game of this scale than to the more epic-feeling Antike and Imperial, but after repeated play of all three titles, I have found the opposite to be true.  Hamburgum's more traditional Euro game structure provides fewer opportunities to recover from early mistakes and "attacks" (church-building is a bloodthirsty business), and its lucklessness doesn't contribute as much to its replay value as is the case with Mac Gerdt's two previous games.  Not bad by any means, but far from great.

I liked this game.  The rondel mechanic is getting a bit less novel now, but it still really seems to work, as down time between turns is almost null, as long as players plan their next move.  The one game we played lead to a blasting run away win, not even close.  Would like to play it again to see if this happens again.

Oddly enough I enjoyed the theme.  Seems almost cliche these days, building churchs or cathredrals, but this one really seemed to work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Potentially a great game, but the end-game just ramps up and arrives too quickly. By the time you get anything going, somebody builds the last church, gains a ton of points and that's it. I have only played once, so take my opinion with the appropriate caution. I do like it enough to want to play again, but if what I noticed in the first game becomes a pattern, I doubt we'll want to keep the game in the collection.

I like the feel of the game. Like the other rondel games, you need to plan a series of moves. Since money is only used to buy goods early game, you don't need much cash until late game. Building your city network so that it will be optimized for multiple bonuses is essential. Getting into the city as the second or third donation is good, since you get the bonus tile cheaper. I didn't deal with putting many ships out, but that can be a good way to hinder other player's progress.

Another forgettable box cover that hides a nice economic game with several ways to victory. It's lighter than other Gerdts games, but still features meaty decisions that will shape different strategies. The rondel always works wonders to create a fluid gameplay, as always.

First impression (4- and 5-player): It's a good resource management / optimization game. It's a pleasant game to play. It's a meaty game but not too much of a brain burner. Plays pretty fast too. For some reason it reminds me about Caylus even though there aren't too many similarities between games. Both have similar building aspect. There isn't any luck involved in the game but it doesn't feel too deterministic. Works well with 4 and 5 players. A very good game.

A decent game of trading and donations. The choices are limited, at 1 per action, so a player needs to get the most bang for his Thaler (or Pound Sterling) and have it work for several turns. The trading and stock market aspect of this one is excellent, with its "supply & demand" mechanism. The use of ships, people (houses), and the rondel makes for a fun game. However, the scoring system (donations) is convoluted and could use a few tweaks to move this from just a good game to an excellent one. The art goes from plain (most of the game) to godawful (the cover). Overall, though, this is a good game that is well worth playing.

I've been impressed by the rondel mechanism and Mac Gerdts (the designer) has done a great job of utilising it in a game that is very different to previous rondel games - Antike and Imperial. The game flows very well and partly thanks to the rondel there is very little downtime. However, the actions are very abstracted and although it's a nice efficiency engine game, the lack of interaction and the theme never really draw the player into the game enough to hide that fact you're simply maximising the rondel. Great components, the clay bricks are a great touch, but the art is nasty and a bit confusing.

After first play - I enjoyed playing this. The first time I have played a game with a rondel - the rules were really easy to pick up and the game play straightforward. I suspect the game plays better with more players; this game was a 2 player game, which at times became a parade of produce goods, trade, donate to church. Having said that, there was a lot to think about over the course of the game and I am keen to play again.

Disclaimer: I helped playtest this game.

Played once at home with friends (4p) - two of us liked it a lot, one was medium on the game (claimed it had too much going on) and one was noncommital but appeared to be more on the 'like it' side. My opinion of the game hasn't changed - I like it quite a bit, especially when played more quickly. I disagree somewhat with those claiming that the three goods are essentially identical in function - they're quite different in terms of location on the Rondel, which leads to them emphasizing different play tactics. Sugar, being immediately in front of Church, demands more forethought as you can't sell it, buy resources and then donate without paying extra. Beer and Cloth are more similar to each other but still have differences based on market position. New players will tend to drive all three commodities to the minimum amounts quickly; more experienced players will tend to buy fewer buildings, leading to more variability.

Nothing like Antike or Imperial, despite the Rondel. This is closer to Cuba, maybe Puerto Rico/Caylus in it's genetics. Hamburgum is an economic/VP engine building game, and the scoring system is quite bizzare (though unique) - it all works together pretty well. Not particularly exciting or interesting.

The rules and mechanics are straightforward and work well, the game is fast moving with little downtime and although there is little direct player interaction, there is scope for affecting opponents by taking desirable donation tokens or buildings or reducing the capacity of their ships. Despite being a strategy game with very little randomness it should be suitable for families (I have played with my 12 year old) or groups with a little experience of eurogames although it's probably not a gateway game . It would need more plays to tell whether it has the depth to appeal to those who prefer heavyweight games.

I'm a fan of the rondel mechanism as the game churns along so quickly. It's nice seeing plans come together (or fall apart with out-of-sync-ness). I think the game may be all about finding balance - buildings vs donations, money engine vs points - and where to specialise to maximise point conversion.

Acquistato nel 2008 e giocato per la prima volta nel 2010: forse è il destino dei giochi di Gerds (era successo anche per Imperial).

Considerato uno dei giochi minori del ciclo della Rondel, Hamburgum mantiene l'originalità della meccanica marchio di fabbrica dell'autore ma rimane un tedescone da manuale: penuria di risorse e di azioni, che devono essere pianificate con attenzione. Ottimo il mercato delle risorse e come è legato all'abbondanza degli edifici di produzione, e il meccanismo delle navi nel porto, che determinano la possibilità di commercio. 

Grafica un po' sotto la media, ma gradevole.

I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed by this one.  To me, the rondel really constrained the action choices, and it seemed like I never had good options to take.  And I don't really like how moving 1-3 spaces is all free, instead of having some sliding scale of cost.  I personally find the board art pretty ugly as well.

This isn't a terrible game, and perhaps the circumstances of the one game I did play figure into this. We played with 5, 4 of whom never played before. It took almost 3 hours. On a first play, I couldn't figure out much of strategy, though in time I might. But here's my critique: why would I? I really couldn't find what was distinct about this game that would want to make me play it repeatedly. It's an investing game that makes me a)gather commodities to b)sell for money to c)buy building materials to d)build buildings (or make church contributions) to e)make money, around and around until the church contributions have positioned me well enough to make good on the buildings I've previously built. Since I get one thing to do on my turn, I personally found this tortuous. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Beautiful bits for this resource management game -- real clay bricks and metal church bells, not to mention a gorgeous double-sided board and chunky wood bits. 

You're basically balancing your need to build buildings so you can produce goods to trade to procure more building materials to make donations to the church (the only way to score Veeps.) 

Choosing actions on the rondel makes things move along quickly and the theme carries out well throughout the game. I like that every turn is a new decision, which really makes an impact on the outcome of the game.

I suspect my rating will go up with more plays (and with more than two people.)

You definitely need to play it more often to start to like it. It's not the usual strategy game where you have multiple paths to victory. The only path here is the donations.

OK rondel-game, but not my favorite. That's because it's sort-off fix phased: first there is a rush on buildings and when the map has been built completely full then it's a rush to finish off those churches. 
What this game also seems to miss is a differentiation in goods. In Navegador, because sugarcane, gold and spices all have a different value. Here cloth, beer and sugar all is the same, especially as they all drop very quickly to 50.

It all makes that this game becomes a bit dull near the end.

One interesting design aspect in Euro games is the tactical/strategic element of sequencing your actions in an optimal order. This can be a heady exercise, but don't worry 'coz the innovative rondel can fix your headache or AP in your game group. Now your actions are listed in a circular fashion whereby you are limited to 1-3 actions (some as simply getting 1 or more cubes of a colour, or selling some cubes for money) at no cost otherwise going beyond this fixed but variable list will cost you VP. I've played 2 of the 3 games using this mechanic (only set up and had rules explanation for Imperial), and as I wasn't keen on the combative and fiddly nature of Antike, Hamburgum was an interesting economic exercise done at break neck speed.

This is a pretty straight up Euro efficiency exercise but something about it makes me want to keep playing it.

I don't think I would ever turn this game down but it's nothing to write home about either.

I was surprised at how much I liked this game.  I love the positional play on the board as well as the economic system.  The game is much easier to get into than the other Rondel games.  One potential fear I have is that the Rondel plays a too heavy roll in defining strategy and making the game feel scripted.

A decent enough game, but like other games using the rondel mechanic, I didn't feel like I had much control over my actions.  I don't mind complexity (see my other ratings), but I DO like to feel like I know what I'm doing.  Despite coming in second out of five, I never felt like I was playing well, I NEVER had that feeling of satisfaction from making a good move.  Also, I'm not a big fan of the theme. I'd play it again, if it was what everyone else wanted to play, but I wouldn't pick it to play from a stack of good games, if the choice was up to me. Personally, I think the "rondel" mechanic accomplishes something badly that other games accomplish in much better ways, such as Caylus's variable turn order mechanic, and Thebes's variable time to perform an action mechanic.

I like that this game is lighter than the other Gerdts games.  The rondel is light but decisions are still meaningful.  The pieces are gorgeous!  I mean who puts actual clay and little tiny bells into a game? 

At its most basic, Hamburgum is a produce goods, trade goods for stuff which you trade for victory points, but there are so many decisions that in turn affect other decisions that it is difficult to accurately describe Hamburgum in basic terms.

Gerdts is the king of making games that feel strange on the first play, but reveal more interesting and innovative mechanics the further you explore.

Hamburgum is basically a standard cube-farming euro, using the designer's signature "rondel" mechanic. It's a good design and I always enjoy using the rondel. But I find I prefer the designer's other "rondel" games (Imperial, Antike, Navegador) which I feel offer more interesting play in addition to having the rondel.

One of those games where you are collecting resources to build stuff and make victory points. Should normally come out quite evenly at the end for everyone if you are not wasting too may turns on useless 'quests'. One of those games that you have to play several times to get a hold of the best strategy. You are definitely in the dark of what's best during the first game. Would think that 4 or 5 player games would be better. I thought that the pieces were quite nicely done. Rules above average for this type of game, in my opinion. Not sure that there is much sense in the starting advantage given to turn order. Would remove the supplementary PP and $$ provided depending on turn order.

"Big Mac" Gerts' Hamburgum is a rondel-based game of production (sugar, beer, and cloth) and sale of goods (via ships that are built and moved along a dockyard; each ship can carry limited numbers of only one good type!) for money, the purchase of building materials, and the donation of these materials in required quantities to each of five churches for unique VP scoring tokens. Donating to churches also enables players to purchase buildings in the adjacent neighborhood, such as production buildings (increasing sugar, beer, and cloth output for the player), merchants (income), etc. A good optimization game, with the map of Londinium on reverse adding replayability and variety. Nothing new or innovative, but an enjoyable Euro with minor elements of turn order timing and route building, as well as balance.

My wife bought this game cheap in the Works several years ago - but while she and some others in my gaming groups have managed to play it a handful of times, I'd somehow managed to avoid it until last night (June 2016). I wasn't expecting much, and nor was I particularly in the mood for learning a new game - but I found I rather enjoyed it. Not an great game by any means, but there is definitely an interesting system here (the rondel led to many interesting decisions in a way which I never felt it did in Imperial in my one play of that game), and it's a game I'd happily play again, if perhaps not too frequently.

Hamburgum uses the rondel action-selection mechanism but suffers from low-player interaction. Working the ships (impacting players' ability to sell for maximum market demand) is a very interesting aspect and I wish it had more impact on the game.

Very difficult to judge after one game.  The end came at light speed, and I ended up feeling like I'd only had 15 or so opportunities to act, which was disappointing somehow.  Also, I'm not sure the rondel works as well here, since losing one or two VPs doesn't seem much of a cost sometimes.  I'll certainly try again.

Played two player and for two games: excellent, if anything exceeded expectations. It takes a while to play, but thanks to the rondel, feels very pacey. I won by arund £50 in the first game, lost the second by a similar amoumt, which I think is an interesting situation for a zero-randomness game. I certainly prefer Imperial/2030, but this is really a very different game, particularly as it plays 2 player so well, closer to the niche of Brass, Puerto Rico and Powergrid. Mrs S loves it. Plus it cost £7.99 at the works - bargain. Nice bits!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very smooth flowing economic game that's got plenty of room for changing strategies, player interaction and replayability. Nice mix of ideas that keep me engaged and coming back for more. Very reasonable playing time. I think your milage my vary according to the speed of your playing group - you have to keep up a decent pace. It can be frustrating for a player to wait for your somewhat lengthy church or building turn when their next planned turn is to simply just take a commodity. The turn lengths are a little unbalanced in that regard.

Works best as a three player game.

RATING: 8
Mac Gerdts and his rondel have done it again! Players are businessmen that try to reach fame out of giving donations to build churches.  To do so, they have to collect money, either from trading goods at port or from open buildings in town.  With that money, they may buy materials to give the said donations, open new buildings or put new boats in the dock.  Nevertheless, players need to focus on the game's objective, which is not making money, or building a merchant empire, but getting victory points.  The sin of this game is that its author has been able to publish, in a short period of time, three outstanding games that share the rondel mechanic, even if they have nothing more in common.  The editor has some part of the guilt, cause the graphic art and the general appereance of the games are very similar too.  This way, players may have become saturated of joy and some of them would have though that there is a lack of originality or a repetitive pattern.  I believe this would explain the [i]low[/i] rates of this game compairing with the ones of [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/19600]Antike[/url][/i] and [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24181]Imperial[/url][/i].

Another game I bought locally from someone selling an open copy. I was afraid that it'd be too similar to Navegador, but my wife and I played it twice one day and thought it was different enough. I enjoy no-luck Euros, and the rondel is a great way for action selection. It was fun with 2-players and I also really enjoy playing with 3-5.

This is a very solid design that builds interestingly on the work done by Antike and Imperial.  
Personally, I think I would rate it as the best of the three, but I suspect that Imperial will be the 'geeks preferred choice.  However, it does expose the weakness of the Rondel mechanic a little more than the other two - the mechanics don't feel anything like as integrated with one another in terms of timing issues (perhaps not a long enough development cycle?)
Still a perfectly fine game.

Ah, the rondel. It's amazing how well this works in such different games.  This game is all about incremental planning; taking three or four turns that look like nothing is going on for a sweeping power move.  The crux of the game is the economy of actions, getting the most done without expending too many turns to do it, sniping actions on the go while racing to get position. There are a ton of ways to do it, and none of them are obvious.  Very engaging, and probably for many, frustrating.  I quite enjoy it.

My first experience with the Rondell mechanic did not disappoint. I am amazed at what an ingenious little invention this is and how it manages to keep the engine humming along while creating balance at the same time. A wealth of strategic possibilities emerge during the course of the game that will keep me engaged for repeat plays. The quality of the game is stunning with tons of wooden pieces, great artwork on the board and chits and even little bells and real bricks. Loved it.

Not nearly as "magical" as the earlier Rondel games.  In this case, the Rondel seems a bit more tacked on than in the other games.  Our group seemed to had to continue consulting the rules to understand which things applied to things in a district and what was map-wide.  The rules and components didn't really seem to come together, and it felt like a series of unconnected systems.

Another successful Rondel game! As usual, the game moves along quickly because of the Rondel. It's an economic game: figure out how to make money (producing and selling goods, where capacity to sell is manipulatable by shipbuilding), buy materials to build buildings and donate to the churches, as efficiently as possible. May be as good as Imperial, but plays more quickly. One odd thing, however, is how things seem to slow down later in the game: goods sell for less money so it's harder to raise cash, but the final church piece is more expensive because of all the buildings that have been built. Still, I look forward to playing this more!

Games where you buy and sell goods rank among my favorites, and I like Hamburgum as well.  It moves FAST and the rondel is always an interesting mechanic.

I like the game. It isn't like the other rondel games. Mac used a kind of simple resource management game with the rondel, very destinctive from his previous titles. I don't think this one is brilliant but, either way, it is an excelent eurogame, very deep, full of tactical and timing decisions. I like the shipping system very much and I could rate it higher later.

RATING: 6.5
Another Mac Gerdts rondel game, quite clearly an ancestor of Navegador and Concordia. Players' donations to churches in Hamburg provide bonus tiles granting bonuses like "4 points per brewery" or "4 points per person in the blue district". These bonuses constitute the overwhelming majority of player VP. Trading spaces allowing [i]either[/i] the sale of beer/cloth/sugar or the purchase of wood/bricks/bells, used for both buildings and donations, but trading is limited by the number of a player's ships... produced, naturally, on the ship space. Players can initially only build adjacent to churches where they have donated, and buildings are needed for increases in production and other effects.

As usual in rondel games it's all a timing nightmare. The requirement to sell first at one trade space and buy at the other (opposite sides of the board) is particularly challenging as it does take several turns to get anywhere. With inexpert players like us it feels less like runners in competition than runners in the dark accidentally tripping over each other because other players' actions are so hard to predict and there are so many ways to inadvertently get in someone's way. 

Artwork is OK but graphic design is hideous (e.g. the eye-melting inner-glow gradient borders).

It's not awful but something about the gameplay doesn't feel quite right. The spatial element is nice but the combination of timing games and various building/scoring constraints comes up as less than the sum of the parts. It's a lesser Gerdts and in practice I expect that it will never get played over Navegador.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Enjoyed Hamburgum very much on first playing and have currently played it eleven times.  The rondel works superbly for this game.  The mix of economics and church building for VP is blended extremely well.  Very nice level of complexity.  PS:  Bumping this back down to an 8 only because it has been superseded in my affections by the author's newer rondel game Navegador.

The type of game I enjoy playing but have no reason whatsoever to own. I picked up on some of the game's subtleties quite quickly and actually won my first game of it, which probably has alot to do with my rating. If I hadn't won, I'd probably be feeling very 'sixxy' about the game right now. It's interesting to note that I nearly completely ignored the commodities (beer, sugar, cloth) in the game and still won handily. I focused on the buildings and churches.

It clearly inherits the rondel's sequencing / race aspects from the earlier games, but it feels quite different. You need to balance church donations (which earn the right to score VP) with other investments (which determine how many VP you get). Keen to play again soon.

Stragely reminds me of Container, minus the player interaction. It has a lot of "do this to get that, then use that to get another thing to use that thing to get victory points." The whole A to B to C to VP is confusing and makes coming up with strategies very hard, especially seeing where you're heading due to all the steps needed to get VPs. Still, it was pretty fun and I think better than Container because it didn't rely on player interaction to determine who would win, which often resulted in Container games being a "one player gives the game to another" situation.

In my first game of Hamburgum, I learned that I like the rondel.  However, I don't like games where I'm churning goods into other goods into other goods into victory points.

However I will not likely play Hamburgum again although I would take one for the team if necessary.

Quality rondel-driven city builder. The aim is to make donations to the city's churches and your efforts are funded through the trading of goods and the construction of building. The donations then lead to victory points awarded for achievements in the game such as having a certain number of citizens in one of the city's areas, having built a certain number of one type of building, or based on a number of donations made etc. Like all of Mac Gerdts' rondel games, the key to success is to gauge the timing of the options available to you and which ones to pass over. This leads to 'Hamburgum' being a very well balanced game to play and is further evidence of the enduring appeal of the rondel as an excellent central mechanism for games of this nature.

RATING: 6
Played once.  The roundel works pretty well and the game is quite different from the other roundel games that I've played.  You're buying and selling the three commodities to raise money to increase your economic engine and donate to the churches in the area.  All the points come from the church donations but you can hang onto some of your scoring cards to try to increase the points you'll get from them.  There are 30 donations and in our game we averaged about 9.5 points per donation (that's including the church completion bonuses and points lost to moving extra on the wheel: sum of total scores/30)  The other thing I noticed was that the game went quicker than thought as people started making 2 and 3 donations at once. 2008/2/4

Without our house rules, I'd give it a 6 or even 5.5, as the game is repetitive and all is about money.

The rule changes: whenever you choose Church in rondel, you must afford only one donation token, and must score it immediately. The game ends as soon as the last church is built. No further goods or money to prestige scoring. The routes on map now are not used.

Now timing, citizens, ships and money are all important, creating tough decisions.

Now it is a 7.5 so far.

I'm not a great fan of the rondle games at the best of times.  This is better than Antike, but I still don't like it.  I admit that I have only played it once, but I felt I was playing against the system rather than the other players.  If I am persuaded by someone to play it again a few more times (and it may take some persuading) I would not be surprised if my rating went up a bit, but any game that puts you off that mch in the first try is difficult to make yourself go back to to try again.

Great materials, very clear board, nice mechanics (the wheel works always really well, even better in a resource management game than in games involfing battles like the previous Antike and Imperial). Still, after a few plays it's really dry, and doesn't give me the "feeling" that I really am in Hamburg trading goods and building churces... above average, but kind of boring after a couple of games.

This rondel game falls in line with Antike in that there are lots of ways to score points, you have to use a good distribution of them, and you have to use one of them more effectively than everyone else. After one play, this rates just below Antike for me - its fast and interesting (though no direct conflict).

Excellente alternative a Imperial pour ceux qui ne sont pas toujours 4 ou 5 joueurs. Le materiel est impressionnant par sa qualite, pas necessairement par son originalite. Le jeu est interessant, demande de la planification et exige la prise de decision, mais il lui manque un peu de plaisir pour le rendre memorable.

Does the world really need another game about building churches in which there is a strange 1600s guy starting at you from the cover of the box?  Well… yes.  Hamburgum has the excellent rondel mechanic, which makes for a lot of choices while keeping turn lengths down.

Played with 2-, 3- and 4-players. Great fun with the rondel. Little interaction among players except in the harbor and placement of citizens, but the game is still very fun. It plays very quickly and there is little down time between turns since each turn is pretty much a micro-turn. Highly recommended.

Very likeable game with rondel-type action mechanic. Plus it's about the city of Hamburg and you get to produce and sell beer. Still, for me Imperial remains the best rondel game of Mac Gerdts so far. In terms of interaction, tension and innovation it excels this one by far. On the upside, this one is played much faster.

It scratches the "build stuff that helps you build more stuff" itch I often get.  It reminds me of Puerto Rico, but plays very well with 2 players.  I played with 4, and it played more tightly, with more fighting for locations, but not necessarily better.

RATING: 5
Based on 1 play with 2 players.

I normally don't rate games after 1 play, but I am surprised at how much I DIDN'T enjoy this.

I really thought I'd like/love this game.

Everything works as it should, but it came off as dry.

I really want to remind that this is based on ONE play with 2 players.

I think it would actually be better with more players and after I was able to explore the strategies more.  Still, it's hard for me to imagine rating this more than a 7.5 and I am a pretty generous rater.

I am disappointed, but I definitely need to play this more, before I give a final verdict.

Update:  Rating went down and I have no desire to play again.  I need to trade this.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1


Overall - 1

I feel this will go up with plays but need more plays and will hold detailed comment until a later time. 

UPDATE: Not going to increase the rating it's fine at a 7. The game is interesting and is all about timing your chances to score. Pretty neat idea, I would say one of the lighter Gerdts games.

[q="THoiA's Thoughts"]I do greatly prefer the Londinum side of the board as it's less linear. Hamburgum's side can keep the two players isolated a wee bit more. That's not an issue when playing with more players but Londinium is definitely more difficult to "hide" from the other player.[/q]

Good but not great. The Rondel works OK here though not as well as in Imperial; it is definitely possible for multiple strategies to flourish, but I'm a little disappointed by the churches being so similar. You have to balance efficiency of money versus efficiency of turns, a tricky proposition.

Excellent, excellent components. Simple rules and great game play. Still my favorite of the series is Imperial. Hamburgum has a little pre-determined overall play (first go for buildings then for the churches) which seems it cannot be avoided. But in any way it is a great game to play just for the components alone!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very straightforward trading & building roundel game.  You get goods, sell goods, buy building materials and build buildings, churches and ships.  Buildings help you get more goods, usually, but flood the market and drive prices down.  Churches give you bonuses and are the game clock.  Ships help you trade. Everything is laid out at the beginning and it's a lot of being efficient and timing your trips around the roundel.

There is just enough here to make the game interesting, but not enough to complicate it unduly.  The lack of extraneous complications gives the game a similar feel to Puerto Rico to me.  In both games it's very easy to see what's going on and it's about making the best choices.  There is no hidden information or uncalculable factors.

Of the three first Rondel games by Mr Gerdts, this is the one that I like best. Hamburgum is less original and maybe a little bit drier than Antike and Imperial, but it is the first one with which I did not experience any problems (like the endgame in Antike and the investor card in Imperial). The game provides plenty of turn angst up until the last turn and and it feels nicely streamlined once you get going. I really do not care for the artwork of this game, but just as Antike and Imperial it comes with unbelievably high quality components (lots of wood and even clay and little shiny tower bells). And it plays great with 5.

RATING: 6
I have a soft spot in my heart for the lightest of the rondel games, it's the zippiest realization of the euro side of Gerdts' designs. Navegador might be the "better" game, but Hamburgum is fast and functional in a much more straightforward way.

One play, Spiel 2007. Build-a-VP-engine game where you choose your next action from a rondel. There's not much player interaction, so its all about being more efficient than the next guy.

I had this one on my radar for at least two years, I think it was one of the first games I had on my wish list. For price reasons, I always seemed to end up buying something else. Well, my wife Deb took care of this for me, buying it for Christmas.

Wow, we really enjoyed this one. We've played Imperial once, but this is our first rondel game we own. Imperial was ok, but in general we're attracted more to building than finance games.

Turns are quick so no downtime, easy to learn, fast to play, lots of nice decisions to make; where to build, what bonuses to go for, which characters to have, which spots on the rondel to skip and which to go for. Everything just works really smoothly here, and it's great fun.

Rated after three games. I kinda like the rondel, but I seem to suck in the games, which are using it. For example the latest game, I had some plans, which failed, because of my miscalculations. Then my backup plans failed for the very same reason. This game is about building churches, manufacturing and trading. Idea is good and mostly themed ok. There should be a little bit more interaction between players, I think. Nice game, but nothing that would make me to really want to play this.

Clever ideas do not a good game make. I've played this half a dozen times trying to like it cause several of the mechanics are "cool", plus Mac Gertds is one of my favorite designers (Imperial and Machu Picchu are both in my top 10). My last game was just awful- there is absolutely no tension in this game, nothing important ever feels at stake. The incremental nature of the game is exacerbated by the fact it is so repetitive and long, and there is no genuine palette of strategies. One of the worst aspects is the end-game, which sees itself dragging on as players vie for what are generally the leftover scraps after all the lucrative donations have been made. In sum, there just isn't enough going on in this game to give it real texture or depth.

The rondel is an interesting mechanism.  When the action you want is on the opposite side, do you pay the victory point cost, or take the most useful action you can get to for free?  Makes for lots of tense decision-making over the course of a game.

Purchased Essen 2007. Another good rondel game, this one lighter than Antike. It doesn't feel like there are many paths to take towards victory, as everyone has to make church donations to score points. However, there are different strategies in how you get to the donation stage and which tiles you choose to score points with once you're there. It seems quite well-balanced: in our first 4-player game three players ended with the same score and the winner was just one point ahead, despite all of us taking different approaches to the game.
I like how the rondel speeds up play, forcing you into difficult decisions and making you think you're just behind another player (even though you may have actually been round the rondel more than them).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Reminiscent of Peurto Rico where instead of playing the role selection timing against the other players you're playing the rondel timing race against the other players. I particularly like the counter balanced cost to the 5th church build being higher for players with more buildings on the board (it creates two distinct strategies to try that so far has been quite fun to experiment with)

The rondel itself is a nice way to make sure a balance of roles get done.  It's an abstract method for handling simultaneous activity (i.e. you select the next action and not the current action again because thematically the time is still occurring with doing the prior action) Another way of looking at it is you're allocating sequentially what you are doing simultaneously -- but in an non-ending circular manner.

The word sluggish comes to mind when I think about Hamburgum.  The other would be mechanical.  Since I have yet to try Imperial or Antike, this is my first introduction to the rondel system, and seeing how the actions are arranged, I can't help but feel that the game would probably play the same time after time after time.

Don't believe me?  Let me demonstrate.  The goal of Hamburgum is to build churches, but in order to purchase the necessary materials you will need to have an income.  Since all buying and selling has to be done by selecting trade, with the restriction that you can't do both at the same time, that means you have to perform the action twice.  Luckily there are two "Trade" sections on the rondel, so to maximize your efficiency, it is almost mandatory that you utilize both of them every time you make a trip around the circle.  Therefore, before you pass the "Church" and "Guildhall", you must acquire enough lumbers and bricks.  Then prior to hitting the next "Trade", you should have already obtained one or two different types of goods to ship for money.  "Dockyard" is optional and used infrequently, it could even be skipped completely if you manage to snatch up most if not all of the captain buildings.  Round and round we go as you repeat the process.

I don't know about you but that doesn't seem very exciting for me.  The lack of varied play totally make this game unappealing.  Not to mention the terrible and convoluted VP scoring rules from the collection tiles.  I get a headache just recalling how many times we had to read the rules to make sure we understand how the points are assigned.  So there you go, Hamburgum is a big, fat dud in my book!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Hamburgum is a nicely designed Euro with many interlocking parts that all work together well.  Frustration throughout the game is medium-to-high as you always want to do more than you can, and the rondel works like magic with action selection.  Looking forward to trying this with more than 2 players, although it works very well with 2.

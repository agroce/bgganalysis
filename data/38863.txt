RATING: 6.5
There are several things to like about this title. First, the speed at which it can play once everyone knows what's going on. Second, the interesting mechanic of "full / half" moves on the market board. Third, the attempt at modeling a real open outcry market -- something many games try (my games and prototypes included), but don't really do very well. Fourth, the risk of being excluded due to having the lowest contribution to charity.

All mechanics are clean, clear, and stripped to their bare minimum. There is absolutely nothing unnecessary in anything about this game. 

Is this a great game? No... but it doesn't have to be for what it is.

Hab und Gut (and its close relation, Mercurius) fill a unique slot in my collection. There are two very unusual (and quite brilliant) mechanics here: Partially communal cards to select from (i.e. limited information); and the end-game elimination of the stingiest player. Both add a very unusual feel to the game, and are wholly successful.

One of the most tense games I have ever played! It's also the game that I have the greatest difficulty maintaining a poker face in.
It's amazing: a brainburner with rules that can be explained in five minutes! Therefore, suitable for both gamers and family alike.
Any negatives? Two:
1) Rather lightly themed, but this is made up for by Michael Menzel's unbelievably beautiful art.
2) There is GOBS of room for analysis paralysis! Even players that you would normally consider immune to the contagion might fall victim.
Probably at it's best with 4 players (you have 50% information). Three players is utterly cutthroat (66% information). The two player variant (75% information) works very nice, as well. But five players is good, but very chaotic (40% information). You'll also find the following to be the case: the more players you have, the more all the stock prices will tend to be high by game end; the fewer the players, the greater variety in prices at game end.

RATING: 6
A simple stock market game in which players have partial information about how the market is likely to behave.  Packs a High Society-style sting in the tale in that the player who gave the least to charity automatically loses.  

I've quite enjoyed playing this game, would certainly play again, and yet don't feel very enthusiastic about it. I think that's because the decisions it presents all feel fairly obvious.

Varias partidas no registradas.

Buen juego para pasar un rato con un grupo amplio que puede ser no jugón.
Me gusta este juego pq te sirve de comodín para una sesión larga (se juega en una hora o así) y la mecánica, sin ser perfecta, es divertida y original. Es una simplificación del funcionamiento de la bolsa y suele gustar a todo el mundo.

En la parte mala, con las partidas te das cuenta de que la suerte influye bastante dado que dispones solo de info parcial y también si lo juegas mucho puede llegar a cansar pq la mecánica es relativamente simple.

Pero en cualquier caso, por lo que vale, y el punto de originalidad yo creo que es un juego que merece la pena tener, aunque sea para jugar con las visitas no jugonas.

Love the shared-card thing, haven't even heard of that existing in any kind of form in any other game.  I love most of what happens in the game too, with some notable exceptions.  A 4P game was good, with prices ending universally high.  A 5P game was eh, with prices ending really universally high.  I think the game does better with each fewer player, and expect 3P to be best.  I also think open information would benefit it a lot, and it could be done if players reveal their stocks and pre-choose which ones they are donating in secret.  With more open info, I think people would have a better sense of alliances than they get from looking at remaining share counts, and the decisions on stock manipulation could end up being less chaotic.  I'm also not a fan of going through a percentage of the deck, shuffling it all, and going through a percentage again because of how lopsided the distributions can be.  I wouldn't want it to be totally deterministic, just some kind of middle ground.  All that said, I still dig and recommend it.  With 3P, 4P at most.

Részvényes játék egy ötletes kiesési mechanizmussal: részvényeink bizonyos hányadát el kell adományozni, aki a legkevesebbet adományozza, az kiesik. A mi partinkban az esett ki, aki amúgy a leggazdagabb volt, ez azért nem túl szimpatikus, bár mindenképp izgalmat visz bele.

A játék egyébként nagyon szerencsefüggő (40% infó van kb., meg amit mások vásárlásaiból kikövetkeztetünk). Lehet taktikusan játszani, de akkor is nagyon függ a szerencsétől. Fontos, hogy ki kezd!
---
Másodjára sem estem hanyatt a játéktól. Elég zavaró volt, hogy az első körben 0 infóm volt a "nyerő" részvényről, és mindenki kétszer jött, mire újra sorra kerültem, így addigra már egekben volt a részvény ára. Így a játék 1. körében (a 8-ból) már elég nagy biztonsággal meg lehetett tippelni a későbbi győztest: aki olcsóért vette meg a jó részvényt. Erről eszembe jut a vicc: hogyan lehet a kákán csomót keresni. Olcsón kell megvenni, drágán eladni:)
A játék sorrend mechanizmusa nem tetszik, az infóhiány is zavar, de ettől könnyed játéknak elmegy végül is:) Jellemző, hogy eddig mindkét partiban olyan lett az utolsó, aki amúgy 2. lett volna, ha nincs az adományozás. Tényleg izgalmassá teszi ez a része.

Hab & Gut is an obscure little gem, that was recommended by fellow gamers from La Tana dei Goblin Bologna.
I was skeptical when I read the rules, because the design seems very dry and stripped to the bone... but the gameplay is smooth, full of choices and indeed has room for skilfull play!
Each turn, players must buy or sell shares (of one or more good), then they must influence the market. And here lies the genius of this game: between players there are Scrabble-like holders, holding the cards used to influence the market, and every player can see exactly two of them! So the players must evaluate what others are buying/selling, matching these informations with other known info (cards in visible holders) and buy/sell accordingly...
The additional twist is charity: every player must donate, and the one whose donations are less impressive is out of the game! This is reminiscent of High Society, but here the donations are secret (with just an update at half game) and the tension is definitely higher.
A good design I am eager to play again.

RATING: 7
A game that reflects the uncertainty of the stock market. You have always some information about the stock (good system) but not all. But the toughest part is to spend some money in the city, because the one who spends less than all the others, looses anyway. So we had a player with most value of stock and money, but he didn't spend enough, so he lost.

Not just another stock market trading game. This game introduces two new concepts to this familiar theme. You have to donate some stocks to charity or be eliminated from end game scoring if lowest. Hand management is shared. Sharing hands with those you are sitting next two was fun and added a whole new dynamic to think about. 

My rating on this game just keeps going up. I just love it. The mechanics are so simple, but unique with the shared hands. You are sort of working with each of your neighbors, but at the same time, you are racing them to use the cards the way you want to.

I've enjoyed my first two plays of Hab & Gut.  As some have said, it's definitely a bit dry, but I did feel like there were a good number of options around what you can do each turn and setting yourself up to buy low and sell high.  The mechanic where you are sharing knowledge about the potential changes in the market with your neighbor is neat and pretty well executed in a simple rules set.  It's definitely one of the best straightforward buy/sell stock market games I've played.

RATING: 7.6
A good, short, light stock-market game. The mechanics were not immediately apparent (at least to me). It was one of those games where you get part way through and suddenly realise what you should have done in those first few turns.

Basically, it is all about pushing prices down, buying low, then ramping prices up, whilst trying to stop other players doing the same. The 'lowest donation to charity loses' mechanism helps avoid any runaway leader problems too. Like the 'shared information' system as well. Only concern is that player/turn order seems like it might be quite important. As there are 2 sets of 4 rounds, this may be a point against the 4p game.

After second play it began to feel a little too luck-dependent for a stock-market game, but I suppose that is the price you pay for a game that is around the hour mark.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Got to play this easy, quick game.  A stock/deduction type of game that is easy to get into and tough to figure out when to buy and sell.  It also adds an element of donation where if you do not donate enough, you lose, period.  So, that needs to be balanced out in what you work on earning.  

Update: May 2017 - bumped to an 8.  Very cool and quick stock game.  More than meets the eye.

Good game but it does not last long enough, or a round could have more turns, or there could be more shares to buy or sell each turn (I guess I could slightly modify the number of shares you can buy or sell and see if it affects the game positively).

An okay game (and certainly a lot better than the old 3M game Stocks & Bonds)... it is a pretty good stock market simulation... and I really like the semi-secret information (cards between players).  I don't think I like the high probability of everything rising over the course of the game.  Important to avoid over-thinking this one or else it drags well past the estimated play time.

Great stock market - buy low, sell high. But two things make it stand out. First, the hidden and shared information. Second, least charitable auto-loses. Lots of bluffing too. And short playtime.

RATING: 4
Provisional rating, as I've only played 5 player and I strongly suspect this is at least 1 and possibly 2 too many!

I like stock/shares type games, so I was expecting to like this much more than I did. Shared partial information mechanic sounded really interesting. But game felt rather chaotic and your decisions largely obvious when it came to actual card play.

Furthermore charity mechanic just penalises those who get off to a slow start worse than those who fortunately get shares going up.

Might be better if charity cards just stayed hidden and unevaluated until the end of the game, but that will make it even more chaotic as an early 'good' share could tank by the end.

However I suspect with 'sensible' play the mechanic of 1 for full effect, 1 for 1/2 will get shares rising in value rather than falling (ie. play + for full, - for half). Given all cards out have to be played, it makes sense to limit the impact on your majority holdings by playing the negatives for half, and grabbing the high + for full as soon as you can. Unless you're going a turn with no shares the optimum play is improving yours rather than trying to hurt opponents, unless all are in something you're not.

Overall, thought I'd like it - and didn't :(

Positively surprised by this underrated game. A handful  of very simple rules are enough to simulate how a stock market works. Looking forward to more plays, but so far this game looks very promising for its length and depth. The shared information mechanism is unique among the games I have tried, which is also a plus.

RATING: 8
I like this for a stock market game. At its essence, a basic buy and sell game. But it has an innovative mechanism in terms of looking at the shared cards of your two neighbours. In a four player game, that is half the information; except each player has different halves! Also, the least charitable is eliminated; which gives this game 2 dynamics which make this a very good game at a length of just over an hour.

This is probably the best stock market game around.

Update Dec 2017. After 9 years, it gets bumped from 7.5 to 8. It has held up as the best stock market game out there.

Excellent, quick little stock market game.  I enjoy trying to deduce the hidden information based on the actions your opponents take.  I like the 3-player game quite a bit more than with 4 players.  With 3 you know 2/3rds of the market information and there are only two market manipulations between your turns (except for when you go first).  With 4 players you only know half of the market information and there are 3 market manipulations between your turns - with one brutal turn where 6 manipulations occur between your turns.  The added chaos of the 4 player game makes it more difficult to plan ahead.  I can't imagine playing with 5!

It's a little too random for some people, but I enjoy it.  Much better than Palmyra or other simple stock market games that I have tried (though I still enjoy Members Only).

Very tight and tough decisions at 3p. Looking for more plays. Sweet spot is probably at 3p or 4p. 5p will prob be too much chaos in my opinion.

RATING: 8
I'm a sucker for stock trading/commodity speculation games, and this is a pretty good one.  The system of having shared insider information works really well, as you end up trading based on a combination of observing what other people are trading as well as the insider information that you know.  To top it off, the person who makes the least "charitable donations" during the game loses automatically, adding a lot of tension to the game.

Never a fan of stock market games but this one is quite clever where you play cards from a rack that is shared with the neighbour to your left and lower or raise the prices. The trick is from one rack you move a good full distance and from the other rack you move it by half. 1 Play. Give it a try.

So far I am a bit underwhelmed by this one. There is just way too much hidden information. If it were all trackable, I would say open it up, but since charity is secret, held shares need to be secret as well. So fine, you need to remember what people have and worry about what they may or may not have given to charity. But there is also the shere randomness of the deal. While the shared hands are very interesting, in a five player game, there is just way too much chaos with three of the hands unseen. I wonder if the game works better with 3. I'm not against hidden information and luck-driven card draws, but when I compare this game to Manila (another luckfest of a shares game), it loses in a big way to that games ability to be very fun and exciting while also having a lot of interesting manipulation.

This is a model of efficient game design. This game design is stripped to the bone! This is a very simple game of buying and selling stock in a market driven by players. The hook in the game is that players can see some of the fluctuations that will happen, and the fluctuations each payer can see are different, but shared between pairs of players. After players buy or sell shares, they choose a couple cardst to affect the market (+/- # spaces). The catch is that the player selects one of the cards to only affect the market at half face value. So although the cards are all chosen at the beginning of each round (of which there are two), it's up to the players to determine where things will really end up. There's also a donate to charity thing, but all-in all, a very straight-forward game. I like the mechanic, but it almost feel like the core to a more interesting game, and not enough meat on the bone for a stand-alone game.

I do like it, but it doesn't wow me.  I don't know if it is the random nature of whether you get in on the right commodities at the right time or whether it is the difficulty in anticipating how much to donate.

A simple stock market game where players buy, sell, and influence share values.   The catch is that players must donate some of their holdings to charity, and the least charitable player cannot win.   It's the same concept that has been used in other games (like High Society) but halfway thru the game, the secret donations are revealed, so you will have some idea how you are doing.   Players get to see half of the market influencing cards, and they share some of the knowledge with the players on their right and left, which is a clever idea and it works well here.  There is an almost appalling lack of control because only half of the cards are visible to you, and you will only select half of those, so the amount of influence you have is very low.   But, despite that, it's simple and fun and for a pure stock market game with speculation, this seems like an excellent choice.

[1 play] This was actually a pleasant surprise because I normally loathe stock market games. This game isn't bad, and the mechanic with being able to see only some of the card racks is pretty clever. 

I also had a flash of insight while playing this game, and realized how similar it was to some horseracing games (like Jockey or Winner's Circle). I tend to like horseracing games and dislike stock games, but if you look past the completely different themes, the underlying mechanics are pretty similar. Betting on a horse is like investing in a stock, and in Hab & Gut, all the players are trying to manipulate the market to make the stocks go up or down in a way that benefits them, just like how in a racing game we might all be moving the horses and trying to do so in the way that helps us most.

Tried in Essen and played at Beyond Monopoly! properly. Excellent! very simple stock market manipulation game, but the element of shared info is very interesting. It's sort of a co-op game, but it's still very competitive. The elimination of the player at the end who made least money for their customers is brilliant. It really forces you to make decisions that take money out of your pocket. Goes in my must-buy list. *** Played again at BM!, lost horribly, still really enjoyed it.

A commodities game.  The board doesn't look very interesting, but this is a short little game (45 mins.) with good mechanics.  Rules are easy, but strategy with some very hard choices lends depth.  

there is an interesting mechanic where each set of cards is available to two adjacent players, so that each player shares cards with the person on the right and the left.  So here enters a lot of hard choices considering which cards to play first.  some memory of what others purchased is helpful.  

Donations to charity are expected and at game end, he who donated the least automatically loses.  The person left who made the most money wins.  So, did you give a lot more to charity than needed, and that lost the game for you?  Did you play cards that hurt your opponent but not enough that helped you? Did you buy low & did the market advance or did it fall?

I played with 3 and even then the market could wildly fluctuate.

An excellent, and fairly simple stock market game with an ingenious way of having each player know only a fraction of the information about which way stocks will go for the 6 types of shares available.  I also like the mechanic that makes the person who contributes the least amount of money to the church ineligible for winning.  I'm surprised I haven't heard more about this one.

Hab & Gut is a simple stock market game built around the idea of sharing information with your immediate neighbours but not the other players at the table. With three players, that means you know 2/3rds of all possible stock price manipulations which still seems reasonable to make sound investment decisions, but with 5 that number goes down to 2/5ths and that changes the game into a lottery.

On average, stocks tend to move upwards, and towards the end of the game many stocks cluster at the top of the scale which isn't very useful.

In addition, it's very dry. Buying and selling shares and adjusting stock prices is what you do all game long, although in fairness it has to be said that Hab & Gut is a fairly short game all things considered.

My initial impression was that I would like this game of market manipulation and that the shared card mechanic was interesting. The mechanic worked better than I expected and would have raised the game to a 9. However, the rules concerning turns was confusing and we had to restart the game. This unclarity brought the game back to an 8. The main reason this game is not a 9 or 10 is that the act of purchasing and selling shares does not itself change the price. This makes the market manipulation aspect slightly unrealistic although it is still a good basic mechanic.

I like the idea of semi-hidden information and its execution in this game is just great. In a two-page booklet there are all the rules and than you go - incredibly simple gameplay and yet rewards planning and outguessing of your opponents based on bluffing and double bluffing. On top of that the victory conditions enable you to win even with an optimizer - a big plus for me.

RATING: 8
This one looked very dull from the descriptions but I'm glad I gave it a chance, because it's very good.  I feel like this is the game that the old Knizia game Palmyra was trying to be, but failing.

Players buy or sell commodities, then play cards affecting the commodity prices.  The cards are displayed on Scrabble-like racks between each of the players, so that each player can see two sets of cards.  Players can control the order in which these cards are played, along with choosing whether they have full impact on the price or only half their advertised impact.  Watching the other players buy and sell will give you some additional information about what to expect.

The added twist is that players may donate some of their commodities to charity.  Those stocks are cashed in twice during the game, and whoever has been least generous will not be eligible to win.  We've seen this before, in a slightly different form, in games like High Society, Cleopatra and the Society of Architects, and Himalaya.  It works especially well here because unlike those games, the charity donations are done in secret and are not trackable.  You know when someone donates a commodity, but you don't know how valuable of a commodity it was.  You do get one update halfway through the game, which will help you decide how generous to be in the second half.

An interesting economic game in which players share market information with the players on each side of them. 

The racks of cards which control the commodities' prices are set up between the players, and each turn you must play one from each. This means that you know half the information of each of your neighboring players. This adds a nice element of deduction and semi-conspiracy to the game as you try to guess if they'll work with you to raise the price of a particular item.

It's definitely a well-put-together game, but it isn't particularly thrilling.

There is some good concept in there, but the game itself is _awfully_ bland and unengaging.  Zero emotions.

What's more, randomness is huge (certain manipulation cards are removed randomly before the game and players don't know which ones so they can easily invest in commodities with shortages of positive modifiers and fall unconsciously into a trap with no prospect for a good score).

2 plays are definitely enough - no more, thank you.

One play only, but I like it.

Stock market game boiled down to the basics, with the players each either buying or selling shares then manipulating the market. Repeat 7 more times, and that's it.

Two pieces of hidden information give it legs, in that each player can only see a subset of the market manipulation cards, and the give shares to charity mechanic isn't one you need to win but is one you cannot lose as the person giving the least to charity loses regardless - a nice touch.

Too many auction games wrap too much chrome around the core of the game. This one, like Knizia's best, moves the focus away from the chrome and onto reading the others and predicting the market.

Avoid this if your intolerant to luck or player elmination.  Probably not a good one for ultra competative groups either.

I love money games.  But when they have a stock market theme, they have to be very good.

This game adds just the right amount of tension and strategy that a game like Shark lacks.

Stock prices are determined entirely by the players through judicious use of cards.  Since two racks of cards are known by each player, there can be some sort of advance planning... however, there are always players who will spoil any plans you have.  Table talk is almost necessary and can play an important role in determining the outcome.

The one twist that I really like in the game, and the reason I rated it higher, is the fact that you can't just hoard your money to win... you must give a little to charity, too (if you are the player who contributed least, you cannot win regardless of your cash-on-hand).

It is probably best played with three or four players so that there is more uncertainty.in the card mix each round.

This is a simple stock-manipulation game. There are six commodities represented on a price track that ranges from $0 value to $250. All commodities start at $40. Everyone starts with $300. You make money by buying and selling stocks, but you also need to give some of your purchased stocks to charity. The player with the most money wins, but the player who gives the least to charity automatically loses.

The game has few unique twists. Buying or selling a commodity does NOT affect its price. The prices change through the use of manipulation cards. BETWEEN each player is a hand of 8 cards. That hand is shared by the players on either side of it. This means that although there are four hands, every player can see two of them (in a 4-player game). These manipulation cards are suited by commodity and have values of -6, -4, -2, +2, +4 and +6. A turn goes as follows:

1) Buy OR sell 1-3 commodities. (optional)
2) Give 1 commodity share to charity. (optional)
3) Play manipulation cards. (mandatory)

All shares owned or given to charity are kept face down, so you don't know exactly what are people holding and what they have donated. To manipulate the share prices, you play one manipulation card at full value from one hand and another manipulation card at half-value from the other hand. Because you are buying or selling before you manipulate, it is hard to create and ideal situation for yourself through the play of cards.

It's a simple game, but I think that the fresh ideas introduced give it a pretty unique feel. It's light - you only have control up to a certain extent - but interesting enough for us economically-minded gamers. A good evening closer or opener for sure.

Another of these rare games where the rules are so simple that you wonder if the game will work at all. After one play, I know that it works but I'm afraid that there might be a decisive starting player advantage. With two thirds of the information available, the best shares are pretty obvious. The first player can buy cheap and drive the respective shares up without too much of a risk while the other players may have to follow if there is a clear best option. Fine as a filler but limited in its appeal as a stock market game.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  Of all the games I've tried with a stock market mechanism, I like this one best.  I think the old time theme is a little dumb, I would much rather prefer a more modern theme that makes sense.  Why would you be giving money away to charity?  I would like to see it rethemed to a game in which you play one of those evil Wall Street brokers that is privy to inside information on trades and has to set some stocks aside as bribes to keep the regulators pacified.  Whoever gives the least bribes is caught and imprisoned, thus losing the game.

Anyway, I really enjoy the almost cooperative element of sharing information with two different partners - once you see your neighbor's buying preferences you can pretty much tell how they're going to play your shared cards.  It is also fun to guess what other players have in store based on what they're buying.  And the High Society mechanic of whoever gives the least automatically loses is fun, automatically making the game much better.

There are a couple small problems.  First off, I think there should be more negative cards, but that's probably due to our playing style, as we like games where you can hurt the other players.  I guess you can tell from the way the board is set up that the market trends up, but it seems pretty tricky to truly buy low and sell high.  Secondly, since the market trends up, it seems like the last couple of rounds are not as meaningful, since it's too expensive to really buy anything worthwhile and everyone just passes.

Comments after 2 plays.

In my two plays (both 5 player games), this pattern formed:  the price of once stock was driven down of one stock and the first player at that time (3rd player at beginning of game) was able to buy 3 full stock shares.  He was able to sell stock one turn later at a substantial higher rate than in the 3rd round.  Both the initial 3rd players proceeded to win the game.  I think this player advantage can be countered, but I also think that it is also always present (not just groupthink).

Besides the potential turn order problem.  I think the game has too much chaos for my tastes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the better stock market games I've played. After reading the rules I thought that the mechanism around partial market information might be the game's saving grace as other than that it felt quite lame. And the game plays well using this single mechanism to its advantage. Game plays quickly and the High Society scoring mechanism adds a bit of positive tension. The biggest problem might lie in the ever climbing prices as players buying a lot for cheap in the early game profit most in the late game.

I think stocks will always trend upwards which means scoring could be tight and the need to pay attention to what your opponents buy is important (especially the persons to your left and right). Give too much to charity and you'll lose, but give too little and you'll also lose.  Very neat game that I bet gets picked up by an English publisher eventually...  

UPDATE: Think this is a very underrated gem.  Four players is definitely the sweet spot.

RATING: 5
Very simple yet cleaver "market" game with two interesting dynamics that work very well together to form an entertaining and fun experience. Each player is able to see market manipulation cards on either side of them as can their neighboring opponents. In addition, the player who gives the least to charity by the end of the game cannot win. This creates a very cool non-perfect information game where each person only knows a portion of the total information available and needs to do their best to try and figure things out with player’s actions and choices.  Sees like it would be great with 3-5 players.

RATING: 6
Quick stock manipulation game with a clever mechanism to partially share information (you look at and select cards from two sets of cards, one shared with your left neighbour and the other one shared with your right neighbour). Make sure to donate enough money to charity or you'll not be in the running to win.

Not a thrilling stock game. 

Maybe better with less, only played with 5 and seemed very random.

the winner bought a few shares very early then passed every turn of the second half only pausing to sell them when they maxed out...

Played in Essen 2008. After reading the description and rules I thought that I'm going to like it (a lot). But it was a disappointment. Shared information -system is unique idea and it works, but all the rest needs more tweaking and fixing. I REALLY hope, that they will use the same shared information -idea again with better game.

RATING: 8
Good with 5 and probably ideal with 4 players (not recommended with three).  One of the better Stock Market type of games.  Players get a select portion of all the hidden information available (peek into the potential future market up or down ticks) to make their speculations.  You can also pay attention to what other players are speculating on for added info, but are they can be bluffing or could be tipping their view of the future?  I really love the novelty or innovative mechanisms this game captures.  It's not a perfect game but very interesting for a game running 45-75 mins.

RATING: 8
I really enjoyed this stock market simulation game in which each person has a limited knowledge of how commodities will be moving in the market (which is also shared by the player on either side of them!...and which could be played by them as well during the market manipulation stage).  There are four rounds of buying OR selling stock along with the opportunity to give a stock to charity (whomever gives the least money to charity at the end of the game automatically loses the game) and a market manipulation round after each round of buying/selling stock.  Then, stocks sold for charity are revealed and you have an idea where everyone is at in that aspect of the game.  Do the same thing all over again and the game is over except you also cash out all your stock as well - whoever has the most money as long they weren't the one who were the most miserly wins).  I do wish they would have included more negative manipulation cards however - stocks tend to be very high value at the end of the game.  When performing the stock manipulation phase - you play one market commodity card from both sides - one at full value (positive or negative) and one at half value.

A very interesting stock market game where you have partial information in the game about how stock prices will move.

After that, the player with the most money wins.

Original way to simulate the "I have some knowledge about the stock-market, but not all". 

Game is simple. You buy stock, and the stock will change in value because of the actions of all the players. These actions depend on the cards they play from their shared (with their neighbor) hand. You try to sell at the right moment.

Very fun and fast economic game where you make decisions base on half the available information.  We liked it a lot as a group but the player elimination at the end can be quite frustrating if the one eliminated happened to be the one leading.

Clever stock market game where the market is influenced by cards.  You make decisions based on what cards you have and the cards visible from your opponents.  You can see half the cards of each of your neighbors to the left and right.  Worked well as a three player being able to see 2/3 of the cards.  With 4 players you would see 1/2 the cards and with 5 players only 2/5 of the cards.  

Additionally each round you can donate stock to charity.  At the end of the game whoever donated the least is eliminated.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rating based on a 5-player game.  The blind charity giving seemed to dominate the game.  The decisions were largely meaningless unkless you were playing last, because any influence you assert is likely to be undone by the players after you.  All the share prices headed upwards at varying rates, and stayed there mostly; since players are going to burn the negative cards at half effect to protext their investments, I can't really see that changing in future plays, except as a tactic when playing last, since you'll have fiorst opportunity to buy cheaply.  Even then, most other players are likely to follow suit if the shares are available.

(Disclaimer: A three player game may be more interesting, since you have more variability in the cards out there, and can see more of the available information.)

I bought Hab & Gut in a sale from a French shop. It seemed a very simple stock game, with fast gameplay...

And this is exactly what I found after playing it, maybe a bit less fun tan I expected. 

You have only partial information about what the evolution of the market will be and there are a couple of mechanisms that give some minimal meat to the gameplay.

Otherwise, it's a pretty simple game what will not have big lovers.

A decent stock market game, based on shared partial information. Slightly longish and repetitive, at least with slow players. 

The main issue here is that the prices can easily get stuck at the maximum, which makes the affected shares useless. A few negative joker cards might have been helpful here.

5 Nov: Played once so far with four.  An ingenious take on the stock market genre that allows for collusion, educated guesses as to the information you don't know, and a 'donation' mechanic that forces you to divert some of your gains elsewhere.

規則:
◎期貨指示物放在對應的價位欄上40元位置，牌架放在兩位玩家之間，每個牌架8張炒股卡
◎每人300元和一個捐獻板，起始玩家多拿一個高帽指示物
◎遊戲分成2輪，每輪進行4個回合，每回合由起始玩家開始順時針進行，每個回合分成兩個階段，一個階段輪流執行完後換下個階段

>依照時價賣出1~3張股票
>什麼都不做
2.炒股階段  玩家從左右兩側的炒股卡各挑1張打出，先後不拘，先打出去的炒股卡效果完整，第二張效用只剩一半
◎當第一輪的4個回合結束後，捐獻板上的股票翻開並且賣出，所得放在捐獻板，此舉是在讓玩家確認自己在捐款上是否處於落後
◎第一輪結算完，將所有的股票卡重新洗牌，每個牌架重發8張卡，照第一輪方式進行第二輪
◎第二輪打完牌遊戲結束，一樣賣出捐獻板上的股票換錢，捐獻金額最低的玩家淘汰(平手一起淘汰)，未被淘汰的玩家賣出股票，結算金額總數(不包含捐獻板上的錢)最高的玩家獲勝。

*若兩人皆達到250元標準，比較個人獲利，獲利最多的玩家獲勝。

This is a surprisingly good game! I'd recommend playing it with at least 4 players! It's amazing how the players start to speculate on changes in the market! If you play with 4 players, you share information with the player to you right and the player to your left, then you start analysing the player opposite to you, things he buys and things he sells, add that to what you know and your in for a really cool ride! Nice game indeed!

On top of this it's a really easy game to play, uncomplicated, simple mechanics but awesome effect! Great surprise!

Just rose the score from 8 to 8.5 (21/08/2011) and might even raise it to a 9. This has caught me by surprise yet again. How players respond to certain actions is amazing, and the way you may use that to your advantage! Fantastic game, incredibly simple! It has just about three rules! I'm blown by this game!

- Rules are short and well explained! Easy to teach and even easier to play! Top notch this one!

Stock buying, selling, and donating (with the least generous player being eliminated at game end), along with market manipulation via the play of price adjustment cards.

Hab & Gut é incrivelmente fácil de aprender a jogar e uma partida demora menos de uma hora. A mecânica de mão partilhada é verdadeiramente original e dá muito que pensar, pois nem sempre estamos a trabalhar para nós, por muito que nisso acreditemos. O tabuleiro, de formato original, proporciona um emotivo acompanhamento daquilo que pode ser a fortuna ou a ruína de cada um. Palavra final para os “rebuçados”, que são a arte ilustrativa de Michael Menzel e as réguas para a disposição das cartas de manipulação do mercado, que tornam este jogo uma peça de colecção que todos deveriam ter em casa. Obrigatório!

First play with three had some surprises - namely how much other put into "charity" so there is a bit of a psychological element of knowing your opponents.  Beyond that, knowing some but not all the potential market information makes for some interesting decisions.  Plays quickly so that's a plus, but sense it is best with 3 and perhaps passable with 4 to avoid too much chaos between turns.

Hab & Gut is pretty straightforward stock exchange game. It has (at least to me) a new mechanism of 'shared partial knowledge' which gives people sitting next to each other some knowledge about whether the stock is going to rise or fall. It's also possible at least partly manipulate the market to suit your needs. Easy to learn and inventive but also somewhat repetitive. I also dislike the instant loss rule if ou haven't donated enough money to charity (maybe because in my last game I lost because of it :-).

Reduced stock market game where players have more or less information about coming changes. It's an interesting, fresh and not very complicated game when you like to speculate in shares. But be careful: if you have donated the fewest money of all players you lose immediately.

I fare poorly in stock games, but this one is quick and painless enough for me to believe it will make a fun occasional play--the charity mechanic and shared partial knowledge of stock fluctuations make it engaging.

It's certainly a game where you have to be keep an eye on what your neighbours are up to. You can see half the market movement cards in the game, just not the same half as the other players. When you see the player on the other side of you buying into a colour share then it's probably because they know something you don't. Bluffing doesn't really enter into it. So, pay attention to your opponents buys and sells and market movements, react accordingly with your buying, selling and market movements and see how you go. You won't fall asleep while playing by any means. It takes only about 30 minutes to play. It's reasonably fun. It's probably not a game you'll want to bring to the table over and over again. Fun, but it kind of feels like half a game system in need of another half somewhere.

A kiállítás eddigi legkellemesebb meglepetése. Alapvetően egy tőzsdejáték, de rengeteg jó ötlet van benne. Például az, hogy a játékosok egymás között tartják a kártyákat, így egy játékos 2 kártyapakliból is dolgozhat. Ha valaki keveset adományozott játék közben, automatikusan kiesik a játékvégi pontozásból. Izgalmas és nagyon élvezetes. A hossza is tökéletes.

Great game! You will have the feeling of playing with real actions! 

+ Fun
+ Excellent implemation of theme 
+ Fast
+ The more I play it the more I like it
+ Unique system (nobody has the perfect information and nobody knows the same info about how prices will change)

- If you are behind you will probably not come back (I guess) 
- More "random" with 5 player than with 3

Stock market games are usually hit or miss for me, but in this case, it's somewhere between.  I've given it a relatively high score because I wouldn't hesitate to play it again.  But would I purchase it?  Would I displace another game to make room in my crowded collection?  Hmmm.  Not sure yet.

It has some really cool mechanisms.  

The elimination of the player who donates the least to charity provides just the right amount of speculative uncertainty.  Furthermore, the amounts donated by each player in the first half of the game are revealed at the game's midpoint, giving the players some idea about their current standings, and whether or not to donate more aggressively in the second half.

Sharing a different card supply with each neighbor gives some insight into the near future of the market.  Every card you see on the racks [i]will[/i] be played, but only half of them will be played at full effect.  Once your neighbors have chosen which cards to play at full- or half-effect, you can begin to determine which stocks to sell and which to buy.  But only with modest confidence.  

The board is rather bland; and though the components are of high quality, the overall appearance struck me as uninspired.  It didn't [i]look[/i] like an innovative game.  After all, the board is nothing more than a simple orthogonal grid, making it clear that it's a rather pure stock market game.  And in fact, that is the case -- the market is [i]directly[/i] manipulated by the players.  

That said, the shared card supplies was enough to make the play engaging.  And the donation-based elimination provided necessary tension.  In the case of Hab & Gut, the bland appearance is deceiving.

So would I make room in my collection to add Hab & Gut?  Not sure.  But I'm leaning toward "Yes".

[COLOR=#006600][b]Why we own it: [/b][/COLOR] 

[i]Update 11 Jan 2010[/i]: I gave in.  We own it now.  (I know, big surprise.)  That shared card supply was the clincher.

Egyszerű tőzsdejáték, amit két érdekességgel dobtak fel. Egyrészt, aki a legkevesebbet adakozik a játék során, automatikusan kiesik és utolsó lesz. A másik dolog pedig, hogy a tőzsdei árak mozgását befolyásoló lapokból mennyit látunk. Minden játékos között van kezdetben 8-8 ilyen lap, tehát minden játékos kettő ilyet lát és játékosszámtól függően 1-2 vagy 3 ilyen nyolcast pedig nem. Ezekből kell kettőt választani körönként, amivel az árakat lehet manipulálni. Érdekes jó ötlet. A játék másodikra már gyorsan is lemehet. Könnyed átvezetőnek is elmegy.

Sure this is not a realistic market simulation game, but who cares. The shared information mechanism and the "least generous loses" rule are both winners in my book. The weight vs. playing time balance is perfect for me. Played with 3, 4 and 5 many times and I've enjoyed every game.

At about an hour per game, this is the perfect lunch time game and since I do 90% of my gaming at work at lunch, this was an amazing find. I would never say no to a game.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 5er.

An interesting stock-manipulation game. It's basically the price-speculation part of Automobile, but boiled down to the barest essentials. It _ought_ to play quickly, although our first game took 105 minutes! It was fun at first, but I'm not sure if there might be too much randomness (card dealing) and ability to benefit from turn order. Also, I'm not sure that I like the stock manipulation mixture is ideal: almost every stock ended up near the top of the charts!

--- Summary ---
2 halves, each with 4 rounds. At start of game, set stock prices at $40 each and give each player $300. At the start of each half, deal 8 cards per player (6 stock colors, +2/4/6 or -2/4/6). Cards are placed in racks so only you and your left-hand neighbor can see them. Each round has 2 phases, starting with the Start player and going clockwise. On your turn in Phase 1, either buy 0-3 stocks or sell 0-3 stocks, then you may donate ONE share face down to charity. In Phase 2, choose a card from the left and right rack to adjust appropriate stock price on the cost chart (min 0, max 250): one for full value, the other for half. At end of round, pass Start Player marker to the left and repeat.

At the end of each half, sell stocks donated to charity and set cash aside. At end of game, players sell any stocks they still own. The player who donated the least to charity is ineligible; of the remaining players, the player with the most cash wins.

RATING: 7
An easy to learn market game that plays out fairly quickly.  More and more, I'm appreciating games that don't have a steep learning curve.  If it does, it better be good!  The prices generally tend to increase quite a bit for each item over the course of the game, so I wish there were more negative cards.  That would be more realistic and, more importantly, prevent players from passing too often in the later rounds because they can't afford anything.  A fun one that I hope hits the table again soon.

Observations after one play - Very interesting mechanics. However i feel buying and selling should have a spread i.e buy at one level higher,sell at one level lower. Plus markets move mainly with supply and demand and the game seems to lack that as all stocks in one commoditycan be bought in a round cheaply. Fact that 3 stocks ended on max seemed a bit lame - would be better if some stocks had a higher beta? Which would not work with market info jnown to players....Will try game again.

2nd game dispelled fears from first. Spread unworkable, this is a clever and light market game with the 'high Society' min = loser mechanic to add some spice

RATING: 6
Simple stock game.  The least philanthropic loses automatically, regardless of money earned and adds amazing tension.  We see games where the difference between donations is often as little as $15--in other words, a single stock price bump or drop could completely change it.

Other than that, the market system doesn't work as nicely as I'd like with its innovative system of being able to see half of your neighbors' cards.  Also, for a game where you have as little control over the stock market as you do with this one, it takes longer than it really should to play.  Given the same circumstances, I'd rather play a couple games of Handelsfursten.

Rating drop.  
After more plays we've decided that the market fluctuations are too large to make the harsh ending elimination rules fair.  A single final turn can break someone's investment in their charities.  To have such a rule breaks theme since it should be the charitable amount should be locked at the time of 'donation.'

as mentioned above, the market fluctuations are too extreme to be fun.  Perhaps with entirely open information, although that would make the game even longer.  But as is, it's just not controllable to be fun.

tl;dr: chaotic!

Buy low, sell high. Simple concept, but in this game it is really hard to pull off. Even in a three player game, where every player has two thirds of the info, you still have situations where you can't see a stellar rise in value of one commodity coming from the one set of cards you can't see. So there's always some crap shoot situation going on.
If you don't mind that, this is an enjoyable stock market manipulation game.

Beautifully mean and vindictive and so very simple to play.

This is the core of simple design and a few rules making a very playable game.

Update: I do feel it's better with 4 than with 5, but it is just about perfect with 4, so it's hardly a big criticism. Turn order is just a bit screwy with 5.

I already knew I loved this game, but it was reaffirmed recently when I was looking at +6, +6, +4, -4 Green on one side and a +4, -2 Green on the other. I crashed the price of green on the turn where I was to buy first, bought 3, leaving 2 for my 'partner' (so he wouldn't screw me over) and then rose it to it's maximum just as the game ended. I did lose by 10DM (the smallest denomination in the game) but it absolutely cemented this as one my all-time favourite games.

Nagyon aranyos kis könnyed tőzsdeszimulációs játék. Van benne egy kis blöff is és az ellenfeleink cselekedetiből próbálunk következtetni az általuk birtokolt információra.

A fix körszám miatt nem tud elhúzódni sem a parti. Van benne olyan mechanizmus is, hogy mindenkinek adakozni kell titkosan a játék folyamán, és aki a végén a legkevesebbet adakozik, elesik a győzelem lehetőségétől. Ezt a mechanizmust nem igazán kedvelem, de itt nem tűnt zavarónak. Talán épp a céljának megfelelően működött, azaz behozott némi interakciót a játékba, mert mindenki figyelte, hogy a többiek hányszor adakoznak.

Mindent egybevetve nagyon kellemes kis játék, ami mindenképpen megvan kb. 45 perc alatt.

The split-hand mechanic means that in a four-player game, each player can see half of the active cards, but a DIFFERENT HALF.

A pure stock market game and my favorite. It is a lot of fun and the donation element is brilliant.  I have seen all kinds of attempted strategies with this one.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they crash and burn, but it is always so much fun either way.  One really does not know who will win until the final count and I have seen some real surprises. 

Picking from a shared hand is a cool mechanic that seems as thorough it might be used more.

Why was this game never distributed in the US?




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4

This is a pretty straightforward stock game with three interesting mechanisms.  First, you have access to two sets of market manipulation cards which you share with your immediate neighbors.  Second, you must play two market manipulation cards per turn, one for full value and the other for half.  And third, the player who gives up the least money to charity loses outright.

The game is all about trying to maximize/minimize the cards you have access to before your neighbor undercuts your plan.

I really enjoy stock games and this one was pretty good.  It's not necessarily revolutionary, but that's okay.

I might like it better with 3 or 4.

After one play with 3 players, I am not sure how much I like this game. I really like the partial market information and having to make the most of that.

Jeu où on dispose entre chaque joueur un chevalet avec 8 cartes "informatives" et où chacun ne voit donc que 16 des cartes en jeu (chevalets à sa gauche et sa droite). Cependant, cette disposition fait en sorte que le ratio "d’informations partiellement partagées" varie en fonction des configurations. Ex : selon le nombre de joueurs, chaque joueur voit à :
3 joueurs, 16/24 des cartes (66% de l’information), 
4 joueurs, 16/32 des cartes (50% de l’information),
5 joueurs, 16/40 des cartes (40% de l’information).

Personnellement, c’est cette mécanique "d’informations partiellement partagées" qui avait soulevé ma curiosité puisqu’elle ne ressemble à aucune autre que je connais. Cependant, mes premières parties à 5 joueurs m'avaient laissé incertaine tant qu'à mon appréciation (possiblement sa pire configuration, l'information étant trop diluée). Par la suite, j'y ai aussi rejoué dans les autres configurations sans parvenir à l'apprécier suffisamment pour vouloir le conserver.

This might not be a "pure" stock-market game (Black Friday might be the closest thing to one that I've played so far), but it's still a pretty nifty game with a buy-low-sell-high mechanism being the primary part of the game.  You manipulate the market using cards on a rack that you and your immediate neighbor can see (you can only see two racks, regardless of how many people are playing the game), and on your turn you can either buy stock or sell stock (but not both).  You also have to think about how much you want to donate to your charity, because whoever has donated the least amount of money to charity at the end of the game automatically loses, regardless of how much his net worth is at the end of the game.  It's a clever design with a straightforward flow, with temporary alliances developing over the course of the game, and a nice tension in how you pick which cards to manipulate the market (you have to anticipate what your neighbors will do).  It may not have great staying power, but I'm interested in playing again.

I like the use of hidden information and the not just earning money idea.

Ottimo gioco di compravendita, facile nelle meccaniche e molto intrigante per la parte di bluff dovuta alle conoscenza dell'andamento del mercato, in più il meccanismo di eliminazione costringe a delle scelte molto importanti.

i like the "shared information" mechanism. But since it's "rich gets richer", a player that much in the lead after 3 out of 8 rounds that nobody had a chance to catch up.

I am a big fan of share trading games. This one is in my opinion the best. It is just share trading, but with a little twist (the donation part) to prevent players to just hoarding the shares.

Hab & Gut is a light stock game that crams a lot of cleverness into its tight design.

The semi-secret market information creates uncertainty in upcoming stock prices, but players can make educated guesses about market swings based on other players' actions.

The charity mechanism is also a kick in the pants, as players need to go against their greedy nature and give up a portion of their investments to have a crack at winning.

Update:

There's a lot of chaos in H&G that's more irritating than fun.  Rating lowered accordingly.

This is a great stock market game. Each player has some information to base their decisions on. It may not work out the way they want but they at least know potential about the different stocks. The semi hidden information is a great mechanism for this.

Pretty cool after first play.

Bluff and some hidden information makes a dryish stocks game much more interesting.

Very Fun, awesome stock manipulation that you could teach to anyone fairly fast. I love the shared information aspect of this game. I wasn't paying attention when this was new, but did it get the buzz it deserved?

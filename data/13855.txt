Well, it's happened.  Too long had Carthage sat unplayed (like so many others...)  I intend on writing a full review, so I'll keep this brief.  I horrendously enjoy this game.  It is a game I feared would never BE made.  The fact that it exists, and is so entertaining to me, makes me happy.  If you are interested in the Punic Wars, you MUST get this game.  More to follow...

This is a great game wrapped up in some very loose rules which, if you like clarity, will drive you mad. Trips over its own complexity and you can't help thinking a bit of streamlining (Mark Herman style) would have made this a classic, like SPQR.

Richard Berg's games require, in his words, "common sense".
Now this would be all well and good if "common sense" didn't include in-depth knowledge of the Roman Political system or how ancient armies actually fought.

This is my final gasp at enjoying a Berg game, but the rule ambiguities could catch up with me... again.

Update:  We didn't even make it through an entire game.  So many rules headaches for so little gain.  And it became very boring;  Most decisions were painfully obvious, very little strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
There is a good game in here somewhere, but for now I find myself confused by the rules far too often. There are a lot of "buts" left open by the rulebooks. This could be my own fault for not having a good enough total grasp, but it seems to me there is much confusion on certain issues. Fun game anyway.

I am upping this rating after playing a lot of Carthage this weekend at the Friendly Fire con in Sweden. Learnt a lot about the system. I still feel this game's substance is somewhat let down by a poorly organised ruleset however. If that was amended, it would be a nine I think.

I have discovered the joys of PBEM by VASSAL for this system, and it really shines in that format. I have upped the rating by a whole point for this. This game keeps finding ways of bringing me enjoyment. Very good product, despite my complaints above. The system is robust and very historically evocative.

RATING: 9
The most complex game I have tackled. It will require much effort to learn the system. The short scenarios allow you to have fun in the process. So far I've played the Mercenary War and found it fun and challenging. I love this historical period and this game seems an accurate simulation while leaving room for skill.

Played the mercenary war scenario. ItÂ´s simple, but surprisingly fun. The system seems to create a very interesting narrative.
The full rules seem to be quite heavy, but once you play things run along smoothly. One warning however: There are a lot of table lookups.
The full scenario (1st punic war) is a bit of a monster that I will hopefully play one day. Considering that the game is sold at a reduced price at the moment buying it for the small scenarios is a real option.

RATING: 7
Half way through our first learning game using the Mercenary War scenario.  The system is complex to learn, but plays smoothly.  The difficulty is in determining optimum strategies when one is presented with a myriad of options.

Finished that first scenario with my Mercenaries pulling out an unexpected win after defeating the Carthaginian general in a devious ploy at the gates of Leptis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Played the smaller scenarios several times, especially the Agathocles(with a personal tweak that I think makes the scenario a little more competitive or it appears that way so far :) ).  The system is very cool with the Roman election rules cleared up, the Carthage rules are easy to grasp and the naval rules are very good, especially in the way they depict the possibility of naval disasters).  This game clearly builds on the RRR and I look forward to the next game in the series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A split rating. I finally had a chance to play the game, and I'm actually rather impressed with the system. The core move/fight mechanics work well, and the tension from the LAMs and continuation rolls feels both realistic and makes the game fun. The battle system works nicely, and although there are a ton of modifiers, it's not too bad and seems to generate plausible results. I love the "guile" mechanic.  The naval rules are a trifle overwrought, but it's not too bad.

So the game gets an '8' for style. The problem here kicks in with the scenario mix, which is awful, and is why I can only give the game a '7'. There are only 4 scenarios in the box. Two are admitted by the designer to be pretty unbalanced, so that can't be good. One (Hiero, Hero, or Gyro) is trivial and useful only as a "push counters around" exercise to learn the game. That leaves us with one legit scenario, the 24-turn monster 1st Punic War. Now, that's what everyone wants to play, of course, but since I don't routinely have 20+ hours to commit to a game, I'd really appreciate something - something interesting, even if it's not the system at its finest - that can be played in 6 hours, which is about the magic number for long-but-playable games.

It could have been just some scenarios that cover jut the early-, mid-, or late-war. I don't know enough about the 1st Punic War to make a suggestion; but there had to be *something* in there worth gaming. If not, why are we even here?

All this comes back to the odd choices for the first couple games in this series. Rise of the Roman Republic didn't exactly have blockbuster scenarios either. It's nice that these early games are warmups for the designer, to allow him to iterate until he gets it right (this is a big game, after all, and my favorite games at this "operational" level - Great Campaigns of the ACW and MMP's OCS - have both gone through major iterative changes). But we won't get to the 2nd Punic War soon enough for me. This is a game I want to play. But the scenario problem is holding me back.

Have a fascination for ancient history of Rome.  This operational level game "gets" the feel of early to mid-Republic right.  Lots of tension and choices managed by a fickle finger of fate.  First ancient era operational game to get battles results right in my opinion where armies of victors can be as exhausted as losers and seldom is one side completely wiped out. Like how movement and attrition is handled into a realistic supply system as well.

[2/27/18] Played a good chuck of the Mercenary War before both sides were wiped out by a longhaired housecat.

There's a lot to like here.  But it can also feel pretty heavy.  This is the first game where I've kept around a notepad for calculating battle outcomes.

Currently playing the Hiero scenario.

RATING: 4
I played a couple of the smaller scenarios solitaire. It's decent. The chit drawing and attrition mechanics are kind of neat, and the designer uses a similar system in Pax Romana.

I worry how many games are going to boil down to the continuation rolls, however. On top of that there's really only one scenario everyone's after and it's a monster. That being said, the history does appear to be well researched, and from what I can tell all of those charts and whatnot do fit the history.

Not having actually played the full campaign game, the most worrying aspect is the map. Considering that the vast majority of the conflict centered in and around Sicily, why bother providing such rich detail of the entire Italian peninsula? Is this provided for some sort of Carthaginian invasion dream scenario? Historically the Carthaginians never did more than raid the Italian coastline from time to time. Or was this map also meant for use in a future 2nd Punic War game? One would think there would be much more focus on Sicily, which makes me wonder how the game will play out in general as compared to history.

I've also docked it for the copious amounts of errata for an already overworked political system, not to mention some substantial errata for other parts of the game. This is yet another beta product from GMT/Berg that did not get the playtesting or rules vetting that it needed. My tolerance for such nonsense is at an end.

Overall I'm not really sure how historical the system is, despite the copious detail. The excessively granular hex-based movement system lets armies perform maneuvers that only a general armed with a satellite would be able to pull off. There's a reason point to point (road) systems are popular in ancients games - because that's where the armies actually moved. And, for all his detail on the Roman magistrates, he gives the Romans three Praetors, when historically there was only one until very late in the war. And if it's not really historical, why bother with this level of detail?

Skip it.

A surprisingly manageable game system from Richard Berg. Plays smoothly enough - for a Berg game. The game concepts are relatively simple, though you would not know it from the overwrought Avalon Hill legalese-filled rulebook. (One negative aspect of the Consimworld rules lawyers coming home to roost, IMO.) But there's really only one playable scenario. Sure, the full 1st Punic War campaign would be great to play but how often can you say you have 20 hours to spare for a game?

Solo he jugado a los dos primeros escenarios.

La sensaciÃ³n que me han dado las partidas es que se activan muy poco las unidades. Las operaciones son muy pocas. Todo depende de la tirada de continuaciÃ³n. Demasiado azar para mi.
Las batallas estÃ¡n muy bien simuladas, igual que las interceptaciones.

What one has to answer when deciding whether to replay or even keep a game is: was it fun? There are probably as many ways to define "fun" as there are players. For this player, this was not fun. It was entirely too much work trying to wade through the rules (sixty-two pages) trying to figure out how to do things, despite the excellent history and attractive components. While I wish I could port the excellent combat system to other games, this game is headed for eBay.

Overall, a state of the art integrated poly/mil opera set in the ancient world. Some dynamite mechanics in this beast. Hats off to Mr.Berg for this gem of a wargame.

Posted session reports (see link below), which should provide you with an idea why this is a great game:

Campaign 2013: http://boardgamegeek.com/article/12266091

Campaign 2014: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1248208

Campaign 2015: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1360567

We completed the campaign scenario (24 turns) in 50 hours in 2013; it had a spectacular ending.

Ohhhh yeah, there are some loose rules...and needless rules ambiguity. My crew has tackled PAX Romana and now Carthage. We were able to make it thru the rules (it does take persistence) to the great story/experience contained in the game. Once the game "clicks" (i.e. you get it), great flow as indicated by other commenters. 

The 80+ hours we have spent playing Carthage produced outstanding game value (story and experience). Just bought the first game in this series as a result: Rise of the Roman Republic.

Just a peeve, but, NO reason a game like this shouldn't have a "here's how to play it video" from GMT. None. For the money they make on a game like this, pay someone a few quid to do a video. P.S. GMT would earn a GREAT return on that token investment via more game sales.

Let's hope Berg gets it in gear and produces the third title in this series: Thunderbolt: The Second Punic War. Berg has indicated this four mapper is in playtest (JAN 2014...possible publish in 2016).

A lot of (slowmoving, wonderfully detailed, ancient period flavoured) fun. Gorgeous maps! On the other hand, the rules are a mess. This system is in urgent need of an updated rulebook including the numerous errata and examples on how to play. Has potential to become the best Ancient warfare game on the strategic scale. Me and this game - it is a love/hate relationship.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Carthage builds nicely on Rise of the Roman Republic by introducing a full set of rules for naval warfare. However, with the expanded rules it becomes even more inconvenient to have them split among two separate rule books: the Ancient World Series rules and the Carthage rules/scenario book. This game desperately needs all the rules integrated into a single volume!

Where Carthage disappoints is in the selection of scenarios. Three of them are tidbits, suitable only for learning, or re-learning, the rules. This leaves the First Punic War as the only scenario to provide any sustenance. While this is a meaty affair, full of historical flavour, it is too long for what it offers in gaming terms. In other words, it is a wonderful and highly detailed simulation but only moderately interesting as a game. 

Overall I can rate Carthage only slightly above its predecessor. I'm still waiting for a volume to unlock the potential of the Ancient World system as a game.

Its a wonderful strategic level game, the main scenario encompassing all of the first Punic War.  Its a wonderfully deep system, forcing you to deal with a lot beyond just pushing counters.  Politics and random events step in to keep things from being too predictable.  Politics especially makes it interesting, constantly making the Romans change leaders, while Carthage punishes success by cutting back the number of armies you can have.

The system took a while for me to get into, as many of the concepts are foreign to me, but once into it, it flows very nicely, making the game actually play quickly.  

The charts and displays are very well laid out, and the map is spectacular!  The map is as much a work of art is it functions as a map for a game.

This wasn't an era I'd been interested in, but now I'm getting books to study this as the game makes it so appealing.

This game is simply great.  A true delight to play.

I know we've just scratched the surface; I'll hold off a rating until we've scratched some more. [UPDATE: Ancients just ain't my thang, so I sold it to skippen. Hope he has fun. I'll stick to WW2.]

It comes down to this: I don't enjoy the historicity of all the chrome. I want to play a game, not watch the History Channel.

Initial rating, based on the idea of the game and on reading the rules.  I need to play it sometime.  Would also like to get the first game of the set, just because I like the period.

Passionnant : activation alÃ©atoire et test de continuation qui permettent une certaine incertitude tout en favorisant les bons leaders, rÃ¨gles politiques pour chaque camp qui rendent bien l'ambiance. TrÃ¨s complexe avec beaucoup de chrome.    
Merci Ã  Alan Ray pour son suivi sur consimworld.

A large, dense game.  The series rules are mostly elegant and not too heavy, but the specific rules are much more fiddly, and required constant referencing during play.  Playing the game feels like the accounts of the period I have read.  It's fun, but requires a considerable commitment to play.

Second volume in Ancient World series. Cleans up some of the more desnse Roman political rules from RotRR, but adds in Carthaginian politics, too. The map is a true work of art! Core system is quite manageable, but when all the special rules get tossed in this game really requires a dedicated effort to get into. Fills a niche, and is an ancient historical gamer's delight. A game that I yearn to play more because of the subject matter, but it's just too much.

Must-have for any ancients lover.  Strategic level - which is my favourite by far - and one of the most thrilling chapters of Roman history.  The 2nd Punic War is the only other subject that can beat this.

Ambitious, original - not enough games to really pass judgement, but will try again.

Carthage proposes some new & interesting concepts but sometimes rules are way too complicated for what they achieve.

Once you get over it (and the fact that you will always need your rulebook & playbook handy, especially the political rules) the game plays rather smoothly & is very interesting with many options & strategies available.

Even if the replay value is great, I doubt however that I will play this one very often as the Punic War scenario (the real meaty one) is very very very long...

Looks different. Looks like a lot of dice rolling. I don't even have a hint if it's a good game without playing it. ***Update: Havent played yet. The rules make me think of a computer game. A lot of modifiers for combat result. I think it will be hard to predict combat result. No simple probability in this one. *** Update: Tried "Hiero, Hero or Gyro" solo just to learn the rules. Made a lot of errors. Then started to set up "The First Punic War" and there's were I am. ***Update: Only played one turn. It looks more interesting than before. Now I understand most of it. Naval tactics for Rome still eludes me though. Decided to buy "The Ancient World 3" if it's ever made.

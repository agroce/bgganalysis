Game play consists of speaking the name of the vegetable shown on the card you turn over. Except that you can't repeat what the player before you said, or name a particular vegetable if there's been a particular card played.
I don't think quickly enough to process whether or not I'm allowed to say the name of the vegetable I turn over so I'll never enjoy this game.

I got this game thinking from the description it sounded like Taradiddle which is a family favorite game that has gotten so much play our cards are falling apart, however it is nothing like it since the cards are played face up, I really don't understand how this is a game at all?  Why would anyone ever mess up and even if they did they still need to be caught (or I guess they could catch themselves but then that would be foolish?) and it's way too punishing if you do, I don't see how they could ever have any chance again, may as well just be eliminated at that point.  If you read the description of this game and think I must be missing something, no, that's really all there is to it, lay down a card and say what it is, unless it's been said or played or infested, then say something that isn't.... how is this a game?  I don't get it...?!??!  Cards are an odd size.

The tongue twisteriness of the game (you can't say lettuce! Or cauliflower!) makes this game vaguely Anomia-like, but I think Anomia might be the better game.

I hate that we've already "memorized" the Anomia cards, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There's a lot of these "say something as quickly as possible, but some words are taboo" sort of games around. This and its sister game, Kakerlakensuppe are far and away my favorite. 

There's an emphasis on speed here without requiring you to be faster than [i]someone else[/i] which I think makes the game (a) more approachable (b) funnier - as all eyes are on you and (c) better paced. Yeah it's funny in Anomia when someone stares blankly at the category "noun" for what feels like an eternity but I'd rather have something a little snappier, I guess.

Doesn't hurt that the art's great and it's in a cute tiny box!

Its sister soup game gets an extra half point for the added slurp/"mmmm!" twist - it's funnier both because of the noises and because it's just yet another thing you have to keep track of. They're really the same game, though - you could just use those rules for this set.

The rules, while simple, are poorly worded. See here for a clearer overview: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/12352412#12352412

Update: My favorite story so far was when my boyfriend played a tomato and exclaimed "tomato!" (toe-may-toe) -> person to his left plays a tomato and yells "tomato!" (tuh-mah-toe). Good instincts, but not quite!

Update #2: I have mixed this with Kakerlakensuppe. I will never go back. The extra brain squeeze of having to keep the two taboo card rules separate is just too good.

RATING: 7
This is a great party filler game! It's a game where you need to think and react extremely fast (within 3 seconds or you lose), and I like those kind of speed games (like Geistesblitz, Jungle Speed, Spot It etc).

Everybody I've introduced it to said it is a funny game and it's a plus that it's actually almost equally good with 3-6 players. It only takes 10-15 minutes so it's great to play between bigger games and when you wait for people to show up and you want to play a short, not so serious game in which there will be laughs!

The only reason I've sold it is because my parents own it as well, so I can always borrow it from them. It hasn't seen much play as of late simply because there are so many games to choose from, and it's not something I'm going to play with "real gamers".

I love this game. Simple, fast, does what it sets out to do – and often hilarious if you're in the right mood. The last time I played this we couldn't say the names we were laughing so hard. I should add that there's no obligation to play with all of the cards. Just leave some cards in the box and shorten the game, if necessary.

I especially like to play in other languages (that I don't otherwise speak, usually German). That may sound odd or pointless but I like the slight challenge it adds and just find it fun to pronounce the different words!
[And he ponders a house rule where you _can_ in fact repeat consecutive vegetable names so long as you change languages, but then you can't repeat languages...]

Awesome game!!!! For both younger and older folks.

Can you remember 4 vegetables?? Can you name them at the right time?? Yes??? Weeeeell, I beg to DIFFER!!! The rules say, if you flip the same vegetable that's already on a table, you have to name another. And if someone already named the vegetable you just flipped, you also have to say another. Thes rules cumulate. And if a cockroach shows up with an x-ed out vegetable you can't name it. Easy, right??

Well, sure, the only thing is, you can't HESITATE more than 2 seconds to name the vegetable!!! THAT rule alone makes the game!!!

Try playing the game. I've already had folks at the table that couldn't stop laughing from all the trip ups folks were having while trying to name the right vegetable at the right time. CAUTION: You may get cramps from laughing so hard!  :)

Again, OUTSTANDINGLY FUN GAME!!

Initial Rating: 5.0 (April 2013)

A fun game with the right group. From this category of games (Snorta, Tarantel Tango, etc.), this is the game I have liked the less. It IS fun, however I’m not fan of the vegetable theme they chose, I prefer to play with animals :D. Also it seems the game has too many cards, so it can take a lot longer than the other mentioned games.

The game is challenging if you play it fast enough, I had a lot of trouble remembering the vegetables, that’s weird as I’m good at this kind of games :S.

I have only played with 3 players, I will play again with more and I will come back to re comment.

Nowadays, I have come to appreciate many games from Jacques Zeimet, so I’m upgrading Kakerlakensalat´s rating to signal my desire to play the game again. I had fun when I played it and I want to play it again in the near future.

I finally played the game again. It wasn´t as fun as I expected, perhaps because the game ran for 22 minutes :/, way too long for what if offers. I´m open to playing it again but my desire to do so (or to buy it) took a plunge.

Even though it's so simple, I found it very difficult to explain the rules, and then quite challenging to play.  If you play fast enough it can be quite a challenge.  Not a game for rules lawyers, since it's pretty tough calling when a player has paused too long, but you wouldn't want to play a light filler with those people anyway, since these games are all about laughter and silliness.  One problem I have with the game is that it seems like there are too many cards - the game could easily drag on forever, which is problematic for something so light.

A game, teaching players to lie... When it is necessary. The main thing in the game is reaction. You must name the card you placed, unless the same card was placed before. In that case you must lie. Moreover, you must lie if other player while lying named your card. And when the card, which bans saying the card's name, is visible... Reaction is everything.

Žaidimas, mokantis meluoti... Kai to reikia. Pagrindinis dalykas - reakcija. Privalai sakyti kortą, kurią padėjai, nebent prieš tai buvo padėta ta pati korta. Tada turi meluoti. Be to, meluoti turi ir tada, jei kitas žaidėjas meluodamas tavo kortą sakė. Ir dar jeigu atversta korta, neleidžianti sakyti tos kortos pavadinimo... Žodžiu reakcija.

Mir gefallen diese Art Spiele gerade sehr gut ;).
Jeder erhält einen gleich hohen Stapel an Karten. Wer an der Reihe ist deckt auf und sagt dazu etwas. Bei den fiesen 7 zählt man hoch bis zur 7 und dann wieder runter, bei Kakerlakensalat muss man das Gemüse sagen, das man ausgespielt hat.
Natürlich wäre das zu einfach. Während es bei "fiesen 7" Gauner am Telefon und mit einer Waffe bedrohte Gauner gibt, bei der man sich räuspern muss, bzw. nichts sagen darf, ist es bei Kakerlakensalat etwas fieser ;). Wenn meine ausgespielte Karte das Gemüse zeigt, das mein Vorgänger gespielt hat, oder mein Vorgänger benannt hat oder eine Kakerlakenkarte dieses Gemüse verbietet, darf ich es nicht nennen und muss eines der anderen 3 Gemüse sagen.
Bei beiden Spielern gilt: Wer einen Fehler macht nimmt den Abwurfstapel auf seine Hand. Wer seinen Handstapel zuerst leer hat gewinnt auch das Spiel.
Schnelles denken... was darf ich sagen, was darf ich nicht... denk blos nicht zu viel, sonst wirds nichts ;).
Die nächste Steigerung kommt vermutlich mit dem Spiel "Gobbit", bei dem man alle Karten der anderen Spieler "fressen" möchte.

Players divide a deck of cards up evenly among themselves.  The cards contain either cockroach, lettuce, tomato, cauliflower or pepper.  You call the name of the card when you place it down and then the next person takes his/her turn.  However, a) if a card matches the last vegetable layed down then the person needs to lie and say one of the other vegetables b) If the last person lied and the next card matches the vegetable stated then that person needs to lie too c) When cockroach is played the stack is moved to the side and a new stack is created... the cockroach card on top of stack one contains a vegetable too which cannot be stated (one must lie).  If anyone makes an incorrect statement than s/he takes all of the cards played so far.  Another quick silly game.  I laughed but I cannot really say I loved it.

The game is quite fun trying not to mess up by saying the wrong word. The rules were not very clear which is odd in such a simple game. I played a four player game and it never seemed to end. None of us could manage to go through the entire deck without messing up. It overstayed it's welcome and a fun game turned into a very annoying game that drags. Not recommended.

God, I hate the theme for this game. I hate bugs. But! This game is so much fun to play! Paulo and I always tend to shorten the amount of time given to players to say the correct vegetable (only 1.5 seconds!) so games are extra hectic and brain burning! I find this to be the perfect first game for a whole day of gaming ahead of players! It gets everyone's blood up and their brains working! Wonderful little series of games from this company!

RATING: 4
If you can concentrate, then it's not too hard to get through without a mistake, so it's not much of a game. If you get the game going super-fast, then it becomes one of arbitrary judgement on whether someone hesitated too long (they have to pick up the pile in the middle and add it to their deck Remmi Demmi style, first to get rid of their deck wins). Meaning it's only enjoyable if everyone buys in to not caring about the win and accepting group judgement, whether you believed it just or not. And if you're not playing to win, then it's more a pastime rather than a game. And it's not a very interesting pastime in the cold light of day.

My new cockroach game, a card game which tests your reaction. Everyone has a pile of cards facedown in front of him/her. Then starting with 1 player, he would open the first card in the middle of the table and say the vegetable's name. The next player would then open his card and place it on the previous card. This is when the fun begins, if P2's card matches P1's card OR what P1 said, P2 have to say another vegetable which doesn't match both. But if P2's card doesn't match P1's card AND what P1 said, he have to say the truth(the vege on the card).

There are also some cockroaches(infested vegetable) card which prohibits the next player from saying that vegetable if his card matches the one on the cockroach card.

Fun game, equally fun as cockroach poker royal but at the end it kind of get a bit draggy if you played it too many times like me.

Not a game in the normal sense because the rules are ridiculously simple.  You just play the top card from your deck and say what it is, except for certain conditions in which you must say it's something else.  And so if you play it late night after a day of boardgaming and everyone is sleepy and silly, it's easy to make mistakes in this theoretically simple task, to the amusement of all. Especially when you're all trying to play it with the Czech names for the vegetables and bugs.

It's a ... uhm, a game about quick thinking and speech patterns (sorta). There are 4 vegetables, you open a card and say the name of the vegetable on the card, except if it's the same as previous card in which case you must name one of 3 other vegetables, unless this one was just named so you pick one of 2 left. Unless there's a cockroach in which case you scream: cockroach! (Zee KakeRlakeN - best german work ewar). And zee KakeRlakeN makes a certain vegetable verboten.

This is a good game and quite fun and though I would rarely request its play,like Apples to Apples, there are times when it is the perfect game to break out.  It is also quite fun with our 7 year old daughter.  It can overstay it's welcome however because of the mechanic that adds to your deck with each mistake.  My family is all about the same skill level which means that we tend to all get the big stack about once, which just draws the game out longer.

I think the biggest problem with this game is the lack of an effective and consistent timing mechanism to put "pressure" on the players to speak quickly--since that's the basis of the fun, not having that seems to limit the play.

[Drei Magier Spiele 2007 edition] {Party, food; perception; optimal 5p or more} Kakerlakensalat is a loud, chaotic and funny party game. It's particular good to play with children.  However, I am concerned about its replayability, which should be very weak.  Once all players mastered the reaction, the game is no longer fun.  The "sure" winner problem is much stronger in Kakerlakensalat than other reaction games - the winner is the same guy.  Even though the game states the max number of players is 6, the game can accommodate more people.

The illustration of card, though colorful, is average - esp. the cockroach, cards are similar.  The cards are smaller than average size. I prefer bigger cards.

It would be nice to play other people's copy. It will be great if it ends around 15 minutes; however, it may drag too long if players continue to make mistakes.  Alternatively, if the game really runs long, fewer cards can be used to shorten the game.

This game is confusing and difficult to play, but not in the rewarding way.  Unfortunately, Craperjunglefaker is no fun and not stimulating in any sort of way.  Play Halli Galli or Jungle Speed instead.

This runs a little long if each player makes mistakes (perhaps it's better with more than 4 so you have smaller decks), but is an odd and very successful combination of laughter, stress, swearing and concentration.

Update: Yeah, it's much better with more players. Much faster and over in time to leave you wanting more.

Rating up from 6.5 to 7.

Easy and gorgeous! Our number one family party game. For the hungarian players this version is more difficult and eventful than the 'Kakerlakunsuppe' (Because the hungarian words 'tomato' and 'pepper' are very similar.)

RATING: 4.5
I guess it can be fun with more players, but I'm only guessing here. Otherwise this rather seems like a lesson in getting you accustomed to dull family games.

Das Spiel kannst du mit deiner Oma, deinen Kindern oder auch mit den Kumpels spielen. Ein bisschen Beshwipst macht das manchmal sogar mehr Spaß.

Die Regeln sind einfach und erweisen sich unter Zeitdruck als nicht immer leicht umsetzbar, was ja den Reiz an dem Spiel ausmacht.

Fun little card game.  Very popular with friends who play more casual games.  If you want to sabotage someone mention how the lettuce looks like cabbage.  Count the number of cabbage curses

About [thing=32341][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=32341][/thing] is very easy party game in which players simply wants to get rid of all their cards, by naming them properly. Can't get much simpler than that.

[thing=32341][/thing] is about pattern recognition in a speditious environment, and main about not screwing it up.

The rules are pretty easy, it plays fast (but can drag a little if everyone keeps getting cards) and fits well for family gaming, as there are no attacks, and even small kids can grasp the rules quickly.

Production value is OK - it is just cards, in a weird size, bad for sleeves, and with a not good nor bad art and graphics. Replay value is in the same league, as the random order of the cards will make for different games, but the feel will be mostly the same, as there aren't ways to play differently (in the sense of going for another strategy, or making different choices).

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
As per the description: the 128 cards – 120 vegetable cards in the four types and eight "taboo" vegetable cards, two of each type that bear cockroaches – are shuffled and divided among the players. On a turn, a player plays the top card from his deck onto the central pile of cards, naming the vegetable as he plays it, e.g., "Pepper!" – except in the following situations:

• If his vegetable matches the previously played vegetable, the player must lie.
• If his vegetable matches the claim made by the previous player (perhaps because that player lied), then the player must lie.
• If he plays a taboo card, he shouts "Cockroach!" and the next player starts a new pile next to the first one so that the taboo card remains visible.
• If his vegetable matches a visible taboo card, he must lie.

Make a mistake or stumble or hesitate too long, and a player must pick up all cards played to that point in the game. The first player to run out of cards wins!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
None. Simply flip a card and say a name. Ok, you can pick the name. That is the decision, but truly it will just be the first name to pop in your head.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Language independent;
- Portable;
- Works well for family gaming;
- Way more fun than expected.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Replay value may be an issue;
- No decisions;
- Playing time can (but usually don't) drag a little more than it should.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Rembering childhood, when naming things was hard and people laugh at you while saying "how adorable", but whitout the last part: is just the laughing part that remains.

As I mentioned already, [thing=32341][/thing] is about not screwing it up - it isn't about speed, dexterity, nor being smarter or trickier. It is simply a matter of not making mistakes. For most of the time is very easy, but names keep being tossed, and your brain starts to not connect the picture to its proper name, things get mixed and someone is bound to stutter, falter or simply make a mistake.

I was worried that the small set of rules and the nature of [thing=32341][/thing] wouldn't truly allow for a fun time. It seemed too easy to get it right and without challenge nor decisions, it would fell and feel flat. I was wrong. We had a blast, wanted to play more immediately after and, once the night was over, kept talking about how good the game is and how fun the play was. Sure, is silly fun, but, sometimes, this is exactly what we need: lots of laughs and little worries. This is what we got with [thing=32341][/thing]. Definitely recommended.

A play on the dissonance between what a person sees and what he wants to say versus what he is supposed to say.  Cockroach Salad is more fun when people are screwing up constantly and less so if they are hitting each note perfectly without flubbing.

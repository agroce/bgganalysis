1 play / 4 players

LIKE: Many options, but only three turns per round creates for a tense game. Very interesting mechanisms using the shuffling of turn order. Lots of combos and some planning ahead. Some player interaction with majority control and bonuses.
DISLIKE: No theme, aside from the king, although the game is still interesting on it's own. Hidden goal cards were boring, I wonder if public shared goals would add to the spirit of the area control? Also, the scoring track was poorly thought out.

OVERALL: I would be willing to play this again, but it is a bit dry (-1 for being very dry). It's a good area majority game, very competitive but not cutthroat.

Juego con muchas opciones, con un toque al Grande (Provincias - corte) pero en realidad es muy diferente, porque a parte de mecánica de mayorías tiene más cosas, como colección de losetas, planificación de movimiento en círculo, tablero modular, etc. Un partida a 4, muy chulo el juego, aunque eso sí muy muy euro puro-y-duro-seco-como-el-sólo incluso más diría que el hansa teutónica del mismo autor. Prefiero el Grande.

Excellent area control game by Andreas Steding!

RATING: 8.65
A vastly superior game when compared with Herr Steding's Hansa Teutonica. I've come to the conclusion that I am a fan of rondel games, so long as the rondel is disguised in some way as it is in both Murano and The Staufer Dynasty! Don't let me know it's a rondel game, and I'll be very happy!

Timing is everything in this one, especially when considering when to go after your secret end-game goals (which really make the game). Starting to place envoys or nobles in a region which isn't scoring is a sure-fire way to tip off your opponents as to what cities are crucial for you. The random set-up of just about everything in the game ensures immense re-playability!

Completely pasted on theme; but Franz Vohwinkel's art is so evocative and almost breathtakingly beautiful that one is nevertheless caught up in the chimerical theme: The Staufer Dynasty is the most gorgeous game I have ever played!

This one is much thinkier than it looks at first glance, but the ruleset is quite simple overall. The end game scoring cards seemed impossible to balance with the scoring objectives but we managed to make them work in the last round or two. The art and the theme is intriguing, I wish it came through a little more strongly, this one definitely just feels like a cube pusher (meeple dropper?). Overall quite satisfying though, the turn order machinations combined with the advanced scoring information mean that this is a game that greatly rewards long term planning, though there are some wrinkles.

A decent take on worker placement/abstract/euro effects that provides a modicum of fun, but this game is not thematic enough for my tastes.  

I can't help but compare this to Steding's famous Hansa Teutonica (HT) design which had deeply felt frenetic upgrade fever as its core appeal, sharp spatial conflicts, and additional attraction in acquiring chits with cool effects.  There is some of that HT magic here, but the upgrade fever is not fevered, and the rondel spatial aspect is not as interesting as the spatial roads in HT.  

On the other hand, the chit combo's are much more central in this game, which for some, might be quite fun.  I liked them, and yes, I might be interested in exploring in future plays how they combine and dovetail to be particularly effective.  The secret goals do add interest and variability, and I am also drawn to the interesting turn order mechanic.  Bottom line:  decent game, not particularly fireworks.

Great area control Euro with a theme surrounding Barbarossa and Henry the VIth, you are spreading influence the various areas of the Roman German Empire and collecting victory points in a myriad of ways. Pay careful attention to the setup, which is interesting but a little unusual. Beyond that, it is a very intuitive design with a load of choices, hidden goals that will vary between games, and privilege cards that can also help you differentiate each experience.

Admittedly, area majority games really need more than 2 players for competition interaction. But the mechanics remain the same at all player counts, so I was able to get the gist of what it would be like with more.

My main complaint is that you have so few actions in the game, that small differences in turn order, hidden objectives, and chest distribution can have a disproportionate effect on the outcome of the game. Hansa Teutonica plays towards the more deterministic end of both of these axes, with very few random elements and more time in which to make the randomness not really matter.

I won't be picking this one up, but I'd be happy to play it with 4-5. It's a pretty short game.

Do you like planning? Then this game is for you. With very little engine building everything is about planning to get the maximum score. Some mechanics are fresh. 

Its a fun game, beautiful but very very euro old school somehow. Somehow it reminds me of ticket to ride. You have tickets, drafting, and spots you compete to make routs* Still enough twists to make it stand on its own.

In this game, you choose between only two actions: taking supplies or deployment ( placing your workers ), but boy does it has a lot of depth.

A solid mid weight Euro that employs area control along with a unique turn order mechanic while tossing in cards/tiles that break the rules.

I was interested in this game because I've enjoyed other Andreas Steding titles; notably Kogge and Hansa Teutonica. Although not on par with these titles and while not bringing anything particularly new or innovative, the game is enjoyable nonetheless and has it's charm. The rules are simple to teach and the game plays fast; not overstaying it's welcome.

Notinhg new here. You do your things for this or at the most the next turn because you cannot afford to have your workers on the board for more than 1 turn. They are too hard to get and are too few for more than that.

The scoring board is just plain "stupid". Who the hell had that idea? 25 VP chits? Were they an extra component just stocking at the warehouse?

Others say: a solid but dry game, feels like old school area majority (been there, done that), what it does is done well, but it's not incredibly special/new/interesting, supposedly the theme and gameplay don't really mesh.

Juego de mayorías bastante original. Lo he probado a cinco y va estupendamente. Se supone que va de 2-5, aunque a 2 me le imagino un poco truño. Tiene un curioso sistema de ordenación de turno. Cada jugador realizará tres acciones en cada turno y la partida consta de cinco turnos. En cada turno se evaluan mayorías en uno (o dos territorios). Cuando llega la ronda de un jugador, éste debe decidir si quiere obtener recursos o situarse en el mapa. Al hacerlo, influye en el orden de rondas en el turno siguiente. Al situarte en el mapa debes pagar con meeples el desplazamiento y el coste de la casilla que ocupas, colocando meeples en el tablero que iran siendo recuperados a medida que se mueva el rey.
Además, cada jugador dispone de unos objetivos secretos que le darán puntos al final de la partida, y unos privilegios que se pueden ganar durante la partida entregando cofres. Es un buen rompecabezas y tiene bastante interacción. Me parece muy recomendable para jugones. No estoy seguro de cómo funcionará con no-jugones. Las reglas son sencillas, pero tantas cosas en el tablero seguro que echan para atrás a más de uno.

Hansa Teutonica is one of my favorite games, so Steding's The Staufer Dinasty has been on my radar for a long time. Its price tag was more than I was willing to pay, though. Thanks to Juegame Store's clearance, I bought a copy for a reasonable price. Let's see if the game is worth it after all!

Point-salad mancala heaven. Yes, the box and board look incredibly boring, and if you want theme, look elsewhere. But if you want fast, engaging gameplay, really interesting decisions to make, and several variable routes to victory, then check this game out. The in-game scoring and special power tiles make decisions intensely tactical, but the long-game scoring cards require a good deal of strategy: if you don't pay at least some attention to both, you will probably lose. The trick is finding the right balance between tactical opportunities and strategic planning. Great game!

I just didn't find anything in this game that was all that interesting, as it's just a very bland Euro.  There are many other bland Euros I like, but I didn't see anything here that was really interesting or new, and there was a mechanism or two that I really didn't like.

Overall, the game is a very simple area majority game.  Each round, usually two regions score.  One region is known, and the other is variable where the players will control what scores.

Other than that, pretty much everything you do gets you bonus chips that do all sorts of things.  These almost felt just tacked onto the design.

I thought the turn order was very problematic, as the last player gets a LOT of control often over what scores, and also another mechanism where players get their guys back to use again.

Overall, this one is unfortunately a "pass" for me. If others really wanted to play it, I'd play along, but would never choose to play myself. Definitely in the category of games that technically work mechanically decent, but lack any fun or interest.

Feels fresh and plays very smoothly, both of which are pretty rare these days. Plays in less than an hour, and the artwork is very pretty. There are interesting tradeoffs to be made, the turn order is inspired, and there is a decent amount of interaction.

But it is a little dry - I don't mean thematically (which it is but I don't care), but the gameplay never generates a lot of tension or excitement. I was never on the edge of my seat, or agonizing over any particular decision. Still, would be happy to play anytime.

Some pretty cool mechanics in this euro. I like that it's not riddled with unnecessary mechanics, gameplay is straight forward, either get dudes or deploy dudes. The turn order track mechanic is well done.  after my initial few plays I don't think this one will hold much replay value, even with the random board setup.

Very good. Reminds me of Il Vechio in it's simplicity and yet also replayability. On you turn you either get more dudes, or send a dude to a occupy a seat. That's it. The score districts for majorities. Private goals (in addition to public goals) create some asymmetry, and chests with bonuses that you get (almost) every time you claim a seat or get dudes also adds to the texture. But definitely on the lighter end for a box that size (but not nearly as light as say Splendor).

RATING: 5
I passed up the opportunity to play Die Staufer when it came out at Spiel 2014: big box, well-known author, big publisher... not a combination which would disappear from sight quickly. I gambled on me playing the game sooner rather than earlier, and that turned out to be the case. 

Die Staufer is... how to put this. The game is well-crafted, and it is impressive how the decisions are forced upon the players with just a two option-action choice, with one being a simple and straightforward replenishment. It is then unfortunate that the game itself is so dry and barren. It is again and again about weighing the amount of meeples you still have against the benefits of spending them, and obtaining a few bonuses along the way so that future expenditures become easier or more profitable. You'd think that this is the core of any game featuring currency, but in Die Staufer what happens is that you simply spend the meeples in two parts: travelling to a location, and then distributing them Mancala-wise in a neutral zone according to how valuable the location is. You can make short voyages to valuable locations, or long ones to not-so-valuable ones, or anything in between. At some point you get part of your meeples back in your supply so that is another aspect to be managed. And that is basically all you do: where to travel, at what cost. There is little creative play to be found here; this is about meticulously calculating moves and stringing them together with clockwork precision. As such, even though it feels like there aren't many buttons to push, it still makes me think of a button pusher.

I also think that at the high player end player chaos will reign supreme. Players are forced into this sardine can and probably need to ponder where they want to be on the 2nd next turn; there is simply no opportunity to strike earlier. Fans of this mess—they play Caylus and El Grande at the maximum number—will probably dig Die Staufer at 5 too. I'd prefer the lower end.

I'm not really sure whether this game would have any lasting appeal. The variability arises from how the cities and the various bonuses are distributed, but unfortunately the end condition is always the same, and thus how the game is played too. Sometimes you will attempt a chest-strategy, and sometimes being in the right place at the right time, and then all that is left is working out the intricacies of the random draws. Which, by the way, feel out of touch with a game this precise. It's not like you have much opportunity to actively hinder each other here because it is simply very difficult to deduce what someone is up to. Was that action taken because of a scoring goal, or because there was no other opportunity? It's hard to say. In any case, the overall package reminds me to some extent of (at the time of writing) hot and popular and equally dull Istanbul. Only then in a package which is quite thinky and thus quite long—not a combination I'm particularly fond of. At least Istanbul moves along at a brisk pace then. As a consequence, although I recognise that the game works well on a mechanical level, I also realise that it is simply not, or no longer, a game which I find appealing to play more than a few times at best. This is reflected in the game's rate. I'll stick to the author's previous offering Hansa Teutonica for the time being.

[b]Update[/b] Or Norenberc, for that matter. Norenberc's system is so much cleaner than Die Staufer's, and although scoring in Norenberc isn't all that transparent it certainly is more transparent than in this game. Die Staufer feels more and more overburdened.

RATING: 6.5
It's hard to describe the gameplay. I like the way that turn order resequences depending on the actions you take, the planning is not entirely intuitive. There are a good few things tugging on your attention e.g. turn sequence, where to score, whether you can make an area score, benefits from the chest vs the main action. All in all, a very good game.

Downgraded it from 7 to 6 after 4 plays. It is okay and new, but there are many other games that scratch the same itch when it comes to game length and complexity. For example, I'd rather play Hansa Teutonica from the same author. It is almost purely tactical, as the chest tiles can vary wildly and some just seem clearly better than others. Also, the end game bonus tiles only seem to matter in the last 2 turns.

Players are nobles in the 12th century, accompanying Henry VI on his tour of the areas of Europe brought under control by the Staufer family, an area that included much of modern-day Germany, from the Baltic Sea in the north to Sicily in the south. You're eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.

2014-10-19 : The board looks a bit overwhelming but once your know the rules play becomes pretty straightforward. Will pick this up when it becomes available in my FLGS
2015-02-28 : Our first 5-player game ended in a 3-way tie, with each of them using a different strategy so the game is definitely balanced and has multiple paths to victory. The rulebook is very well done, the only negative points are the awful gothic font that was used with the names of the cities and the point track which is totally confusing. Rating could go up to 8 after a subsequent play with 3 or 4 because the group's impression was that 5 was pushing it. 
2015-03-03 : 4-player game and normally the rating would have gone up to 8 was it not for the fact the board situation can change so much, it is very AP prone.

The Staufer Dynasty is quick and thinky area control game. It takes aspects of El Grande (a king that moves and affects placement, the area control, and managing province & court figures) but adds an interesting turn order mechanism, some hidden goals, and a multitude of special powers. Turns are simple enough in that you can either get figures or place figures on the board. That said, this has implications on the turn order. When you choose figures that pawn will be near the top of the turn order for next round, whereas when you deploy, you will be near the bottom. Regardless of whether you supply or deploy, you will likely be getting chests... these range from instant benefits, once per game abilities, end-game scoring opportunities, or working towards permanent special abilities. You only have 3 actions per round in a 5 round game, so there is little time to dilly-dally. The board is a rondel with various regions. When deploying figures to a region, depending on how far away from the king you are moving (in a clockwise direction), the more expensive the deploy action is (dropping one figure per region you're travelling to). Each region has a number of sub-regions... left most are better for tiebreaking but are more expensive. 

There are 3 types of end game scoring cards and each player receives 1 of each type. There are sub-region scoring cards where you will typically get more points by having the same valued sub-region in multiple regions, though there are also set types and others. There are patterned region scoring cards where if you meet certain patterns on the various regions, you will score and you can score these patterns more than once. Then there are region specific scoring cards where you try to have the majority (or at least second place) in the subregions of the main region on your card. This seems to be a point of contention among people who have played the game... everyone has a different region card, so it's usually not difficult to achieve, which makes it a moot point. Some feel there is an imbalance in the pattern and sub-region cards. Some have suggested to make a public goal(s) for players to fight over. I'm not sure if it's a problem, and if it is, what the solution should be.

Overall, this is a tight and quick area majority game with interesting decisions to make each turn. There is a fair bit of variety in the game due to all of the elements that are randomized each game. Another benefit is that most components are double-sided to make it work well within the various player counts. It's a good game, but I'm not sure how good until I play it more.

The 'the person most to the [left|right] wins ties" and the feeling that you have to 'choose your battles' is directly from HT, but otherwise not much is the same.
Quite tricky timing and placing workers mechanism which I liked. Some things you get just seems to be way better than others though.

Sokat vártam a hansa után, de azért annyira nem sikerült jól. Mondjuk eléggé fel volt adva a lecke, szóval ettől még nem egy rossz játék. Talán egy kicsit túl fontosnak érzem az elején a megfelelő kártyák megszerzését, amik között kiemelkedően erősnek tűnik a mozgást és a beülést olcsósító. Tekintve, hogy korlátos belőlük a készlet, ez kicsit frusztráló lehet. Nagyon fontos a játékossorrend, ami nem lenne akkora baj, de akkor kell döntened róla, hogy mennyire akarsz elöl lenni a következő körben, amikor még fogalmad sincs róla, hogy alakulnak majd addigra a dolgok. Ez is kicsit frusztráló. Az elsőre is kitűnt, hogy nagyon fontos a végpontozás, ami csomó dolgot von persze maga után. Az biztos, hogy bőven van benne próbálgatni, megismerni való. Nem egy olyan játék, amiről egy-két játék után ki lehet jelenti, hogy mindent tudsz róla.

At first sight, all the little tiles and tokens in this game suggest quite a bit of complexity. It turns out, however, that this is misleading and the Staufer is a fairly simple game at heart. In fact, its biggest issue probably is that there is precious little to distinguish the game from other titles in the venerable realm of tactical, medium-weight area majority games.

The Staufer is not a bad game. It just isn't a step up for this kind of game either.

Ein taktisch geprägtes Setz- und Mehrheitenspiel mit Mancala-Prinzip, indem man durchaus die Birne bemühen muss, um die richtigen Züge im richtigen Augenblick zu machen. Da liegt auch schon das kleine Häkchen: die Spielidee kommt aus dem Hirn, wo es verharrt - es fehlt der guten Idee an Welt und Seele. Heinrich und die Staufer sind nicht zu finden. DIE STAUFER spielen sich sehr interessant, aber ohne das letzte Mysterium. Das Spiel hat meine volle Sympathie, mein lächelndes Gefallen, aber nicht mein ganzes, unbegründetes Herz. Eine gute Vernunftheirat findet Platz in meiner Sammlung.

I didn't like El Grande, and this is El Grande with a load of chrome but no more depth. It pretty much works OK but I can't be bothered with so many rules for a not so thrilling game. Point salad Euro completely lacking in soul. Lots of bits and false choices don't make an interesting complex game!

Overall, I had a lot of fun with The Staufer Dynasty, the turn order mechanism is a clever balancing act, if you use a follower to recruit then you get the benefit of going first the following round, but you may miss out on seizing control of a crucial office. There is plenty of information available about future turns but it is just as important to opportunistically pick up points in the current round as to consider long-term strategy. The variable set-up and different sets of privilege cards ensure that no two games are. The game scales well, and plays fine even with just two players, it is also quick at about 20 minutes per player.

Recognizably derivative of El Grande, but manages to throw in some interesting elements. For example, I was impressed with the strategic implications of the simple, noble-only seat mechanic. The action choice/turn order mechanic is excellent as well.

The art is very nice, but there is nothing thematic about the gameplay, so be warned that you will be memorizing what feels like a spaghetti tangle of mechanics without any useful conceptual framework to hang them on (unless you've played this kind of area-control game before). However, it actually is a pretty short game for a euro and the priority of what to focus on is relatively clear. This is a good thing, and results in plenty of agonizing choices to make.

Note, 20 minutes per player is complete B.S. For your first game, plan on 1 hour/player, and it's hard to see how that would ever get much below 30-40 minutes/player if you're trying to be strategic at all.

Not a favorite, but extra points for the tight design. I think overall El Grande is the better, smoother, more elegant game, but Staufer Dynasty is a nice, shorter alternative.

We played half a game and I look forward to trying a whole one, but it felt very old-school.  I am sort of tired of area majority.  In addition, you have end game goals that are dependent on having meeples in certain positions, but most meeples in regions that score at the end of each round are removed.  I just don't care enough to plan ahead enough to try to win it.  I'm not sure if that means I should not play it.  Meaty for a short game.  Almost superfiller.

1 session: This game plays like it was made by the resentful child of Euro designers, trying to show the emptiness of their parents' traditions. Since I am myself kind of a stereotype, I enjoyed it a little. Only a little, though. If I'm going to get a net gain of 5 points for every action I make, I want to have a little more fun on the journey.

This game got some buzz at and after the fair, which I don't share. It's very much an abstract game and it's all about using special actions. While some mechanics may be interesting, the whole game didn't work for me.

Just another majority game with many different icons/rules with no theme at all. Good old "El Grande" is more tense, even though it's faster and much easier to learn/explain.

Vaguely reminiscent of League of Six.  The things you buy have multiple costs, both of which are paid by going around in a circle to the various locations.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2016)

I didn’t know what to expect from the game. In one hand, it is from designer Andreas Steding who designed the great Hansa Teutonica. On the other hand I have heard bad things about the game and I also have seen it a lot on sales (in fact I bought it in one).

The game components are beautiful and the modular boards are also very nice. The art is great. All things considered, it looks gorgeous on the table. The insert is regular, the big board pieces are very loose so they can get damaged very easily.

The rules are pretty easy to learn. You can teach it under 18 minutes The playtime is rather short, The Staufer Dynasty flows quickly (each player only makes 15 moves during the whole game).

The theme is ok, but I don’t feel it as is usual from (most) eurogames.

The Staufer Dynasty offers only 2 choices each turn: Supply action (get more meeples) or Move/Deploy (use your meeples), but they aren’t obvious nor easy. You have to plan ahead to win the game, but there are also plenty of tactical choices. The luck factor is rather low (with the chests), all other information is available from the beginning.

Due to its modular nature and the way the scoring parameters are set, it has a lot of replayability.

The Staufer Dynasty is an area control game and I really like how it works mechanically. Most area control games have lots of “in your face” and “take that” and I no longer enjoy those mechanisms (besides, the strategy in those games is to lay low until the game is about to finish). Here, no one can attack you directly.

Bottom line, The Staufer Dynasty is a good light-medium eurogame. It features non aggressive/confrontational area control and I really like that part of the game. It has an impressive depth for such a simple game. I want to play it again soon.

First game was overwhelming as I tried to get a handle on the game's systems. Actions are very limited and the game affords quite a bit of latitude for planning future rounds which I was not able to leverage or even appreciate. The experience left me with a positive, but not glowing impression of the game.

The second game a few days latter was much better! The game really came into focus. There is a lot of planning for future rounds and setting yourself up for end game scoring. But tactical decisions abound as well, picking up choice chests, or committing to a region that will score this round. Resource management is also key, you have to carefully manage your supply of envoys.

I'm looking forward to some more plays.

RATING: 8
The abundance of material and many tiles with special functions suggest complexity while Die Staufer has a simple structure as its core. One game consists of 15 moves per player, in each of them one of two basic actions (take resources / build a settlement) can be chosen to win majorities. With an action, a player gets one or more chests providing VPs directly or giving a specific benefit. Usually two of the six regions are scored each of the five turns. At game end, three hidden goal cards given to each player at the start are scored as well.

Due to the multitude of tiles creating many opportunities, Die Staufer is a brain-burning tactical optimization exercise while players have to keep the strategic direction in mind. The variable setup guarantees replayability. It’s undeniably a well-constructed game which I enjoy. It fails to evoke enthusiasm on first sight but my appreciation of the system grew afterwards.

Really innovative, but not necessarily perfectly intuitive. The game sort of like mixes area majorities scoring and worker placement and adds a rondel in which the king pawn is pushing the court forward. There's lots of replayability thanks to multiple layers of randomized setup and Steding has used the two levels of workers to his advantage in a similar way he did with Hansa Teutonica. I'm not sure whether I like the turn order mechanism, though, and the scoring table is pretty crappy.

RATING: 7.5
The staufer dynasty  biggest problem is that it has a ton of bits.
I thought the rulebook was quite poor.  Reading all that text in a foreign language made it a little bit hard to grasp.  the rules of the game are pretty easy so because it was quite big it looked harder than it actually was.

One page of rules would be plenty, 3 pages of examples and a 2 pages of card,symbol and endgame scoring explanation would have been enough.

The game comes with a ton of playing pieces.

Allthough each game will be different , you will do basicly the same thing four rounds. the fifth round is a little bit different as you don't have to prepare for a final round and you will distributing your pieces on the board to score as many points as possible.

Playing time is excellent  and allthough two friends weren't impressed by the game I think there is a reasonable challenge and very little luck.
the luck has to do with your three hidden goals and the last scoring tiles. this could make it easy or hard.

But since you know almost everything upfront it is a game of carefully setting up and outplaying your opponents. 
The turnorder is a simple mechanism but it works really great. 

I liked it with three ,fellow BGG think it is best with four. 
I am not sure if I will come to that same conclusion.  I fear you might loose too much control over the turnorder.

Apart from the rules and probably the rules are so big because of that is that there are a lot of  rulebending treasure chests and cards.  I wouldn't mind if there were less available...
Allthough from a replay stance of view this is probably a good thing. 

SO  POSITIVE

Staufer Dynasty ins't a long game, but when you compare the length and what you get/feel - that doesn't quite fit. The game isn't bad either, but it's far from innovative and the key ingredient is missing.

I always want to give a new Hans im Glück title a try, even if nowadays they have moved to „complex, dry Euro” territory. And it seems to me, unlike the BGG crowd, I like Hansa Teutonica designer Andreas Steding’s less unique, less perfect non-HT games more, so I wanted to try this one as well. And, just like in case of Firenze, I quite like it. It’s JASE of course, with lots of Euro optimization and calculation, but it’s still quite a fine one, even if I still prefer somewhat simpler rules and a more engaging gameplay.

RATING: 6
This is a game I don't mind playing once in a while but I definitely don't need to own the game.  Each game will look considerably different as the goal cards, setup, chests, etc will look different and score differently.  The central mechanism is straightforward to play and the game plays in 60 minutes once everyone knows the game.  Five rounds, 15 actions.  Feels difficult to really do much prep work for your end game cards until the final couple rounds as scoring can make things a bit tricky as that displaces your dudes in that region.  This game is pretty tactical early and switches over to strategic late...

This was one of the main games I wanted to check out at BGG Con. It sounded really good on paper, it's by the designer of Hansa Teutonica, and the turn order mechanism sounded really neat.

We played it at full 5 players, and the result was extremely underwhelming. By far the best part was the turn order mechanism. The rest was a completely generic euro of spending resources to go places and get things and score majorities.

The game felt extremely chaotic, and trying to achieve the end game bonuses seemed ridiculously hard. Maybe the fun of the game comes from taming the chaotic nature of the game into something remotely predictable?

Definitely not a game for me.

Middle-weight Euros that have you hunting for victory points in a pin ball machine of interlocking mechanisms are probably the most densely populated niche in boardgaming (apart from bad zombie games, maybe). Being a standout in this crowd is a tough order, and I’m not sure what, exactly, might constitute Die Staufer’s claim to uniqueness.

The turn order shifting is nifty, the mancala-inspired movement is well done, but it’s hard to identify anything that would me go for a second play of this instead of another one from the vast hill of similar options. Maybe more plays would help, and I certainly would not stay out of them.

Even more theme-less than expected. I found it to be a little too much information to handle. The end-scoring cards were hard to work from until late in the game, which of course may beasier once you know that´s the way the game works. I´ll play again if someone really wants to.

[b]2015-11-06 5[/b] After 1x 5p Play:
Very nice board and production quality. (Apparently) Mancala mechanic is not my favourite. Don't understand why the workers need to be personified if the mechanics don't make thematic sense anyway (ex, pay people forward to take a seat). End game scoring card draw is too random. Some gained 40+ points others, even if they succeeded, would only get 20ish. Could try again, but not impressed after first game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Endgame cards seemed overpowered and somewhat arbitrary in terms of how well they worked together and how they fit in with the semi-random order of town scoring. Not sure if I like the privilege cards (received for two purple chests) but perhaps with more experience it will be easier to weigh the relative value of each.

----------

After playing again, I still don't like the hidden endgame goals because they make up such a large percentage of ones overall score and because it is so easy for players to mess up the goals of others merely by coincidence.  The game as a whole is very bizarre.  It's like someone played a few Feld point salad games and thought he could make his own.  It reminds me of poor man's Rialto in that on its face it seems like an area control game, but in reality there are many ways to score.

RATING: 8.5
The game could use a bag for the treasure chests, they aren't easy to mix or stack  because they're a weird shape and small, to boot.

It looks like a complicated setup, but it's not as bad as it looks, by the second game, you'll just be used to throwing the board and chests out there.

Very high decision-making to accessibility ratio, the game is not hard to introduce to new players given that the actions are quite simple to take with only two primary choices.

Initial plays seem very positive.  I really like the pace of the game and the interesting but not overwhelming decisions.  I feel like there are multiple strategies for points, but not so many that you can completely ignore parts of the game.  The token and card bonuses are all very compelling which really helps add to the decision tree.  The variable setup is nice although I don't know that it really changes the overall feel of each game. Overall a good, solid worker placement/area control game with some added replayability.

Fell short of expectations (same designer as Hansa Teutonica, after all) but I am willing to pin this on the 5p player count. I'd try it again at 3p or 4p. The turn order mechanism was fascinating to me, but everything else felt like complexity for complexity's sake. Will try again someday.

Played this again at 4p and it improved significantly. Still unlikely to request this in a vacuum but happy to play it.

RATING: 8.25
The rules are not complicated, but it takes 20 good minutes to explain them and there are quite a bit icons involved (the iconography is not perfect, but quite good, and it will help you remember). Medium setup time.

The theme is curious: a cohort of buttkissers following the king in his travels, hoping to improve their influence. Nonetheless, even if some mechanics try to represent that, this is another abstract euro at heart.

The components and the graphic design are nice, except for the scoring table: it only goes up to 25, and you have to take tokens each 25 points, at least 4-5 times during the game. It's not easy to see who's winning. Big fail on that. The board in the endgame, full of meeples, is a visual pleasure for boardgame aficionados ;-)

The mechanics are quite cool, nothing really original, but some of them have twists that make them interesting. You are going to get plenty of rewards and it's your job to combo them in order to get the max out of your actions. Even if there's some meat in it, the game is not too thinky and the gameplay is fluid. There are some luck (and random) elements, not strong, but they are there.

There are many variable components that will make sure that no 2 games are alike.

Basically, it is a medium worker placement euro, dynamic, that can be played in a bit more than an hour, much to my taste.

The biggest drawback are the secret goals. They almost make up for half your total score, so yes, the game will never be decided before the end, but you won't have a real indication of how you're doing either. And what's worse, if you have bad luck, some of your goals will get blocked and all your previous good work will be worthless.

RATING: 8
Bought this blindly before even reading the rules because a combination of Steding and HiG promises quite a lot, and the game definitely lives up to the expectations.

The core is a unique mashup of blocking worker placement through rondel-style selection, eventually leading to area influence scoring (simple, and without tug-of-war issues) at the end of the round. All this on top of a massively randomized setup and a devious turn order scheme, creating a refreshingly original experience.

The scoring methods are limited to a reasonable amount of options, and it is easy enough to have some kind of an idea of how well everyone is doing at all times. The scoring track is very awkward, though: Not divisible by ten, and gets lapped multiple times during a game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Well, first the bad.  The game has no theme at all--none. Second, the scoreboard, a separate board in the game, only goes to 25 in a game that scores more than 100 by the end. Third, half the points you score in the game should come at the end from hidden, secret, individual objectives.

But if you can live with those shortcomings, the rest of this game is a gem.  Superb area control, tough decisions, plenty of thinking ahead, strategy, and different paths to victory.  Somewhat of a point buffet along the lines of a Feld.  The good here far outweighs the bad and is a game I can certainly recommend.  Have only played with 4 and it was fine with that number.  With less I think you would start to lose the tension brought about by competing for the best treasure chests.

[b]The Staufer Dynasty[/b] was sold via auction 4/25/15.

[i]The Staufer Dynasty is an area control game with some specific rules on how you move around the board and eventually claim spots in a territory. Mix in some bonus tiles that let you move for free or spend one worker to claim a spot on the board. There are also end game goals you are trying to complete, but in reality you can really only accomplish them on your last turn.  

Here are my thoughts, I would much rather play El Grande if I want to play an  area control game. El Grande is a much cleaner design with a lot less rules overhead. There is also much more player interaction in El Grande, you are vying for control of the same region in order to score it. In The Staufer Dynasty everything is indirect, it feels more like worker placement. Someone takes one space so you now need to take another spot. I also prefer the immediacy of your actions in El Grande, you get into it with people where as The Staufer Dynasty is a much more passive affair. 

My thoughts in a nutshell: El Grande creates an amazing meta game due to those tense, edge of your seat moments that you will be talking about during future plays. The Staufer Dynasty is completely devoid of those moments and therefore falls completely flat for me (it feels too much like a solitaire game).[/i]

I was expecting a medieval rivalry, semi-4x game from the look and title of this game. Staufer Dynasty is not that, but it's a fantastic game. The gameplay is simple and straight-forward: there are only two actions to choose but your decisions are limitless after that initial choice. It's not daunting, it's freeing. The artwork is gorgeous, the board unique, and the game's strategy is simple but deep. It's fun and not a terrible brain burner.

I like euros, but this is the epitome of jase. Doesn’t work for two. Theme is non existent. Too much randomness with collecting tiles. Too many icons to memorize. By the last round I had five tiles and had to look up what each of them meant. Add that to cards that you buy that have more confusing icons and it’s just not fun anymore. My wife summed it up well: “I’m bored.” Stick with hansa teutonica, the designer’s previous game.

This and World’s Fair are what Guilds of London (which I don’t like) could have been. Staufer has a nice tension between pursuing short and long term goals. Your choices each turn are get more resources or deploy resources, but every decision is a high impact one. You only get 15 turns a game but you feel like you had more.  I actually like this better than Hansa Teutonica, the best known game from this designer.

In The Staufer Dynasty, players claim spaces on the board to try to earn majorities as well as claim special ability tiles associated with those spaces. Payment for these spaces is a little strange though. The board is arranged in a circle consisting of six regions, and the King token is assigned at the start of the turn to one of those regions. Payment comes in two parts: you have to pay the travel cost (distance clockwise from the King), and the cost of the space. These costs aren’t paid to a bank--they’re paid in the form of pawns placed one by one on the travel area of the regions, clockwise from the king for the travel, and clockwise from the region for the space. At the end of each turn, one or two regions score (claimed spaces in non-scoring regions stay claimed, others are returned), and then the King moves clockwise a number of spaces, and the spent pawns in the travel regions passed by the King are returned to their owners, ready to be spent again. I felt like this was a pretty solid middleweight Euro, but the mechanisms used by the game were very strange and unique. I don’t know that they made it a better game, but they definitely made it different.

In this game, you have 15 turns to get the most points possible by predicting which regions will score, when they will score, and how best to position yourself for bonus points from the three secret endgame cards in your hand. To do this, you have to take actions that grant you chests with useful powers, and then know when best to use the chests. On your turn, you make one simple choice. Get more guys, or place guys you have. This is not a game that gives you a turn to figure out things before stuff starts mattering; the clock is fierce. 

While the game has that puzzle like quality to it, the puzzle is not solvable, as you are competing with other players for chests, powers, and meeple spots. It's very easy to set up for something early and have it taken away from you through other player's moves, and since actions are so limited, you have little if any ability to make a counter move in response.

Additionally, for the first four rounds of the game, when a region scores, every meeple in a scoring spot gets removed from the board, which means they are no longer lined up to help with your two endgame points. You only know half of the provinces that score each game for certain, the other half gets assigned if a certain criteria is met. This can get quite annoying if you are a person who likes having a plan and then following through with said plan.

Of course in any area majority game, turn order can be very important. If you go first you might grab the exact spot with the exact chest you need. If you go last, you can be the determining factor which second region scores, or beat someone out for a majority. The problem here is that players who took 'get more meeple' actions in the previous round go earlier in the current one. Players who took actions on the board go later. This makes for a sort of boom/bust cycle where your turn order is more to do with when you have to take meeples, than it is about having a specific strategy. Since taking meeples is one of the few actions you get in a current round, it usually means it's best to just sort of pick a few rounds to sit out and just collect, and then a few rounds where you have all the guys and you do all the things. The ebb and flow of this is alright, and i'm sure I never manage it that well, but regardless it bothers me.

5 players, 20mins per player. Maybe consider after all? Larry Levy: The Staufer Dynasty:  I usually make a point of playing the meatier Hans im Glück designs, but I didn’t know anyone who owned this one from Andreas (Hansa Teutonica) Steding.  The reviews for it were sufficiently mixed that I wanted to try it before committing to it myself.  But it was quite good and, remarkably, the estimate on the box of 20 minutes per player was accurate.  Some have complained about the hidden goal cards, but in my game, at least, there wasn’t the kind of random overlap that can lead to problems.  Lots of interesting decisions, moves fast, feels like a winner.  Once again, HiG does not disappoint!

This just seemed like another dull euro exercise. Move pieces around to manipulate turn order and score points. Get cards to score points. Time where your pieces will be to score well when the scoring round occurs. I can sort of understand why others are so intrigued but I was unimpressed. Sold.

A very clever area-majority euro. It may not make much sense thematically, but the way players pay for actions and recover workers as the king moves around the board rewards smart strategy. It is 100% a game about planning ahead. The only immediate rewards are the treasure chest tokens, and choosing which ones to pursue can be difficult, as all seem to play part in a valid strategy. The way player turn order adjusts each round is unique and plays a large part in which actions you choose. Not being able to take a turn for half of a round can be pretty devastating. Staufer feels heavier than it plays. There are many options to consider, but once you are familiar with the choices turns will flow like a much lighter game. 

My only real complaint is the scoreboard, which is way too small. Luckily, there is a better one available in the BGG file section. Overall, this could become one of my favorites with more plays.

I think this will replace El Grande as my go-to majority/area control game. Turns are very simple in that you get two possible actions, but the consequences of each can be huge, particularly later in the game.

One of the best games that I've played lately. Excellent planning, scales well at both 3 and 5 player counts. The turn order mechanism is really fascinating, as if you restock, you get the benefit of going first the following round. Plenty of information is available about future turns, and the various privilege cards provide for tense goals. Love the hidden victory conditions at the end to give you even more things to shoot for, and you find yourself constantly trying to decide between a long-term strategy and opportunistically picking up points in the current round.

RATING: 8
This is a worker placement game with some really abstracted mechanics that offer a variety of different ways to score points.  What a lot of people have taken to calling a "victory point salad" style of game.

One of the things I like best about this game is the very variable setup.  Everything is very modular and each time you play you are likely going to have a different setup from the 6 different pieces of the map to the point bonuses in each map region to the 3 different pieces of each round.  This also means players can each have a very different strategy when playing and they all be viable, and these are likely going to be different strategies from the last time you played.  This offers almost unlimited replayability.

The other thing that I like is this is a reasonably deep game with incredibly simple rules.  Each player has 3 actions each round and each of those actions is either placing workers or resupplying yourself with more workers.  That's it.  However where you place workers, which kind of supply action you take, which of your bonus tiles you use, etc. means each time you make this 50/50 choice there are a dozen different WAYS to take that action.  Where you go on each of these action tracks and in what order also determines the next round's player order which is also neat and something else you need to consider when making your plans and choices.  Finally, each player ALSO has 3 end of game goal cards.  This makes for a huge wealth of things to consider but the simplicity of choosing to place or get more workers each turn also makes it reasonably accessible even if it takes some time or even a couple plays to really work out how you should be doing these things.

The game looks great also, the meeples are all different shapes depending on what they are used for.  The board is pretty and shows a lot of information without looking too cluttered and everything has modular pieces that also fit together perfectly which surprisingly not all games accomplish so well.

There's not really any theme to speak of but this game is all about the mechanics which are so silky smooth and clever that for me the lack of theme doesn't even register to me.  But for those who can't enjoy interesting mechanics without a story this game probably won't resonate with them.

First impressions: I picked this up despite remarkably polarized Geekbuddy Analysis because Andreas Steding ([i]Hansa Teutonica[/i]) is usually good value. [i]Staufer[/i] seems to be part of the same family as his earlier games [i]Power & Weakness[/i] and [i]Five Points: Gangs of New York[/i] in that it features a kind of dynamic area majority: 1-2 of the six board regions will score each round, with one of these regions being known and 1 determined by the players. Victory points are likely to be split between end-game placement and end-of-round majorities, with the twist that figures used for end-of-round scoring are removed. (You might be better off arranging a scoring elsewhere so yours are left on the board.) 

Players get only 15 actions. Supply actions provide more workers (and give earlier turn order in the next round), while movement actions place figures for the majority scoring. Complicating matters are the chest tokens available for claiming locations or taking supply; some of these can be traded in for permanent bonus cards, some grant end-game points, and others grant one-off abilities. The cost of some placements are so high (e.g. pay 7 workers to place 1) that certain chests ("trade in to pay only 1 worker") are indispensable.

Many elements of [i]Staufer[/i] are variable (order of regions, points per region, location of chests, scoring regions, king's location, bonus cards available) but by and large the variability is measured in incremental VP gain. Each game will be the same optimization puzzle, with some constants rejiggered to prevent scripted play.

Is that optimization puzzle worth playing? Well, I like the interwoven mechanisms and the dynamic scoring is quite interactive; it's quite easy for players to collude to force a particular outcome. Beyond that it's quite a gentle affair, though, with low interaction and complexity in the wrong places. I always suspect that HiG has developed the sharp edges out of a design in the name of family-friendliness.

Rating for the two-player game.  Definitely not a two-player game.  Also, it's a bit fiddly for what it is.  We had played Trajan just before and I can't imagine why I'd play this over Trajan.

I've had mixed feelings about [person=1018][/person]. All of his designs have been solid, but while I appreciated [thing=43015][/thing], I didn't really enjoy it that much. [thing=75091][/thing] is solid and quite enjoyable but it doesn't really stand out.
This new title of his is put out by [company=133][/company], known for their very talented development team. They take games that would be good and tweak them until they play better and give more bang for their buck. And you can feel that in this game as well: it is very well developed. And it features a great turn order mechanism. But most of all this is an area majority game. It has some very basic area majority elements which are souped up with bonuses and other stuff to make it be more than just an other area majority game. But most of all the turn order mechanism makes it stand out.

Initial rating: 7.2/10
BGG scale: 7/10

The Staufer Dynasty was a pleasant surprise; a clever little area control game where there seemed to be a lot of ways to take clever actions and plan accordingly. I was surprised just how much I enjoyed this.

Nothing new, but very solid, dry eurogame.

You have the choice between two actions, but every action let you make different things at the same time. If you take ressources (meeples), you will take also take a chest (that give you points or a onetime bonus) and will affect the turn order. 

If you take the second action you will fight for majority, but also take a chest. And ecery gegion has it own bonus.

You score points during the game and during the final scoring (secret goals). What if you would have a combo with the scoring region in the last round and you secret goal. To big advantage? After one play hard to say.

First, my brain does not work on Andreas Steding games.

Second, the scoring track may be the single worst accessory ever included in a board game.  It's hard to overstate how nonfunctional it is.  If I play again, we will keep score with poker chips.

That said, I give it a 7 because it is a really good game.  Easily an 8 or 9 with a scoring track that communicates the relative place of the players.

I liked Staufer Dynasty. It's one of those games where you can play tactically and succeed, but some long-range planning definitely helps. It's also a game where there's definitely a choice between grabbing points or building up your ability to get things done more efficiently later. Staufer Dynasty is more abstract than I typically like in a game, but enjoyable nonetheless.

This was a sleeper hit for me. I love it when a simple either-or decision can have a ripple effect that creates depth for all players in the game. I think this game doesn't get the attention it deserves.

I know next to nothing about this game, but I want to try it. Here's why:
1) Nice cover picture
2) It's an auction game. I do poorly at those, but I quite enjoy them
3) It plays 5 players. That's a pretty big thing for me

I liked the turn-order mechanism. 

I didn't care for the massive importance of end-game goals that you don't have enough control over... if they're hidden you can't make very well informed decisions- but you certainly may accidentally get trod on, whether by players who accidentally snipe spots you need, or by getting goals that will be harder to fulfill just because the king started in a bad spot for your end-game plans (and you almost can't even LOOK at your goals until the last half of the game, because of how much the board changes turn to turn, and because trying to put things in places pre-emptively makes it that much more likely to get forcefully cleared by the round scoring).

I guess, overall, it's much more tactical than I'd prefer, with a whole lot of "hope this turns out ok".

RATING: 4
Disappointing, considering this is the designer of Kogge and Hansa Teutonica. While some of the mechanics are novel, gameplay feels depressingly familiar; the clever ideas just didn't translate into anything different experience-wise than what we've seen a million times before. In sum, Just Another Soulless Euro.

Worker placement area control strategy puzzle with a fantasy wrapper. I like the unique random location order setup tiles. Reminds me of Cyclades. Hex modular wedge tiles surround a unique turn order track to re-supply or deploy dudes. The meat of the game is planning your worker placement around the movement of the king token. Score in-game and end game points by matching area control of locations with card drawn patterns and collect chests. This one is too abstract for me. I'm not really sure how the fantasy theme ties in.

Never tought choosing between 2 action would lead to so much thinking in a good way :D
Either you restock or move and pay for a seat, but man oh man it does it in very good way.

Player order is an very interesting system,one round you can do most action first but other rounds it's possible you have to wait a few turbs to go. Really like this system.

5 rounds 4 actions each round. scoring at end of each round. One condition you know what will score the other one depends on what condition it wants.

Very different and hidden end scoring goals for every player.

Rule is not complicated and there are many ways to get score. The personal goal card make it is various among the main area controlling mechanism but don't involve in all game. Players always have things can do and plan for the next rounds so the advantaged player will change in each round. For example, if you take advantage in current round, you almost can't take advantage in the next round due to your resource limited. This makes the players always race for scores in each rounds and wouldn't be bored.

Really deserves more play. The card mechanics are original, requiring you to discard cards just so you can play the game. Also, some cards must be played vertically, requiring you to plan accordingly. An underappreciated gem.

I really wanted to like this title, but after only one play it has dropped a bit from my expectations. Perhaps that will change in the future, but the game forced far more rules checking then I felt comfortable with. Also, keeping track of your money via chips or on paper wasn't particularly elegant to my group.

RATING: 10
Lots of fun to play. Many strategic decisions involved in card play. Make sure you rent out the whole building, attic to cellar, and only kill your tenants as a last resort.

Really unsure what to make of this game -- it seemed a bit plodding and slow for a take-that game. Might be quicker with more people, and I think I'm going to pull out the Monopoly money when we play at work. Keeping track of money on a score pad just seemed a bit odd.

Really good idea, very well done, and absolut fun.  Just take it for what it is, a fun-fast-Friedemann-filler.  The characters and events are great, pictures are really funny, and game is fast and short enough to play 2 or 3 times in a row.  Really good, although obviously there is quite of luck involved.  But who could care?

Good lighthearted game that has lots of "take that" opportunities. Slightly twisted view of landlord/tenant relationship. Can lead to some amusing play/table talk. Nice mechanics in that all cards are dual use, hand replenishment card costs increase dramatically with numbers taken. Money/Card/Resource ( tenants & houses )management card game

RATING: 4
A fun game, but with a couple of broken rules that don't make it very appealing for a serious gamer - no cap on the number of cards you can buy each turn means that the game suffers from a serious runaway leader effect.  With a few slight house rule mods I would bump the rating up to a 6 or 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light game.  Reasonably fun, and reasonably quick with 2 players.  Lots of direct player interaction.  It looks like it might be susceptible to a runaway leader problem.

Artwork reminds of Mad magazine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice little "take that" style game with some interesting mechanics (double sided cards) and a very dark theme (don't like those tenants? murder them, or bomb the building).

Works best with several players because you need to generate rent to buy cards, so with 2 or 3 a good starting hand can put you in an unassailable lead with a massive hand of cards early on. With 4+, bash the leader kicks in eliminating any early advantage of a good hand.

RATING: 5
6 plays.  A "take that" style game with lots of luck and chaos.  Amusing if you don't play it often.  It's always funny when the police fail to catch a bomber and send an innocent player to jail instead.  I like the dual-use of cards; you have to decide which cards to play face down as floors/levels of apartment buildings so there's some tension when deciding which cards to "remove" from the game for making buildings.  Other redeeming features: pocket-sized game for 2-6 players.  **NOTE: Pay close attention to the rules about getting paid $1 each for empty apartments, I always forget it or get it wrong.**

It was a cute idea to use two sides of the card for the game (the back side represent floors of the buildings).  This does get old fast and so does not have much replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Always seems more fun in principle than in practice; suffers from "sore loser" problems, in that it depends on everyone who is behind to concentrate on attacking the leader, and a rupture of this ethic can create a quick runaway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this game, but the replay value for me is a little low.  Also, it seems like every time we play there is some confusion over how to handle some of the rules.  That being said, it's still a very unique and humorous game.  There is a kingmaking aspect that probably results in my not wanting to play it very frequently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The cards are hilarious, but the gameplay is neither particularly interesting nor particularly fun for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not completely broken, but games where what you build usually lasts as long as the next players turns don't usually do much for me. Nor do games where you arbitrarily choose who to attack (i.e. attack the leader). Having said that, however, it's not completely objectionable. Clearly dated though.

Rating is this high ONLY with the suggested variant (hand limit, increased cost to build etc). The economics are broken otherwise. 

Underrated. Light, lots of options and lots of fun. Compared to Munchkin because you can screw your friends, but has more of an economic element which is what seals the deal for me. 

Great for the Bang crowd. 

There are so many ways in which this game could be expanded. Wish the cards were in color. Probably going to buy a second set and create an expansion set of our own. We love it that much.

I quite like this and it certainly is a favourite amongst the group. Sometimes it can be a great battle of evictions, bombings, etc and yet others it is like a series of solitaire games.

We have played this game many many times over the last 6 years (starting in Gozo), frequently on holiday by a pool under an umbrella in the heat of the day. It can be played a number of ways e.g. lots of low rise buildings for pensioners or high rise blocks for students and others. It can be played gently or aggressively with bombings and mayhem. Everybody we have played it with loves it

This is a cute little card game where you play the cards as stories, or as inhabitants.  You also can cause a little mahem by bombing others.  It is irreverent, and has some drawings that are PG-13.

I'm a big fan of Friese games and this one did not disappoint.  It has a quirky theme that works and is well developed. There is plenty of interaction and even if mainly of the balance-the-game-by-sticking-it-to-the-leader type, the leader can cover himself by careful game play and by using some of his extra earnings to keep more cards which should afford him more protection.  This also tends to prevent any runaway leader effect which I haven't seen in our games.  To the contrary, our games have been close, the last one won by the player who appeared out of it through most of the game, but who managed to score over 50 points the last 2 turns while at the same time disrupting his opponents rentals.  Plays great with 3 players.

Not enough player interaction in the 2-player game. The jail situations just bounce back to the Police player too easily. Hoping it will be much more fun with more players. Oddly, there are several cards in the deck that aren't described in the rules (The Manager is especially perplexing). Game also runs too long with just 2-players, need only 1/2 of the deck to develop the game.

For a "take that" card game it isn't bad.  There are some fun combos to make and the game seems to give enough options that there is usually something worthwhile to do on your turn.  I would never play this with more than three players though as the downtime would stretch this game thin. I do enjoy the economic aspect of the game, although there certainly is a rich get richer element to the game that is intended to be balanced by other players knocking people down.  Still, there is a real hand management aspect, and a significant puzzle solving element that keep me intrigued.

[RGG edition] {Economic, builder; utility cards, pattern-building} The system and play of Landlord is fine: money management, building and sabotage but some cards are over-powered. I find the theme disgusting and I don't like the heavy 'take-that' element in this supposed development game. I also find the artwork horrible: it's so dark, disgusting and ugly. However, this should be fine game for some players.

For similar games, I prefer Spank the monkey or Clocktowers. This game does not give me the fun I want.

Take-that! cards with poor artwork and not great rules.

I'm glad to have played it (see my microbadges!) but can't say it is a classic.

Also, if people can interact with your tenants etc, why have the info on the cards only be one way round? It's frustrating when you're across a table from someone and can't see which of their tenants it is best to steal.

It's a fun, start-up game for most of our game nights.  I own the original German version with the not so politically correct graphics.

(There is a newer version available with toned-down graphics.)
Definately recommended!

There are a few weird quirks in the game: tenants whose value is not how much they pay (Mover, Celebrities), cards with abilities you always have to look up (Politics - what do Eviction and Demolition do again?), and the complete uselessness of the Jail. Still, despite its randomness, quirks, and poorly written rules (in my version at least), it's decently fun once in a while.

Fun FF game, cards and options create a lot of laughs.  Lots of fun.  Choices to benefit your own tennants or to defile tennants of other landlords brings about lots of conflict. Great art, fun game.

RATING: 7
I have very mixed feelings about harsh "take that" games. For example, I love Intrigue, but at the mere thought of playing, my brain breaks out in a sort of internal rash induced by the anticipation of codified mean. And while Landlord isn't as mean as Intrigue (which is without a doubt the most vicious game ever) it is still brutal enough to win the award: "my 2nd favorite game that fills me with misery and dread."

Having a building demolished and tenants stolen by your gaming buddy is the intellectual equivalent to having the guy across the table put your hand in a wood-chipper. Wait? What? We play this for fun? Yes. Actually it is fun-- a lot of fun. Fun, despite the extreme harshness of bad things that can be inflicted on you; fun, despite a few of the crass drawings entirely missing the mark of "funny" and veering deep into "depressing." (For example, a picture of a cruel-smiled father holding a baseball bat standing beside his son and wife who each sport a bad bruise. Really unpleasant and decidedly not-funny imho.) 

Good strategy games almost universally share one element: they force you to make hard choices. It is the tension of the "tough choice" that is at the heart of the gamer's joy. Landlord relies upon a cool mechanism-- seen  in many beloved card games since (like RftG, and San Juan)-- to produce the dilemmas. Like RftG and SJ, in Landlord all the cards are dual-purpose: either they are apartment buildings (think cards-as-generic-currency) where you can house your tenants or they are tenants and actions. Like all "dual-purpose-cards" card games, the essence of the game is hand-management and timing.

The game pleasingly oozes theme: the backs of all the cards are building floors that you lay in front of you to build apartments while the flip side of the cards are tenants (that live in your constructed buildings) or actions (like eviction.) The tenants have varying requirements and issues (musicians move in and other tenants move out) and pay different rents (lower for students, higher for yuppies.)

Each player lays out cards trying to build buildings, fill them with tenants and collect rents. Once you have collected rent you can spend it to buy more cards or alternatively just hoard the money-- for as any ruthless real life Landlord will tell you, the winner is whoever has the most money at the end.

Landlord is one of the few games that compels me to quote philosophers: Derrida invokes Aristotle, writing, "Oh my friends, there is no friend." Oh Derrida, have you too suffered at the hands of Landlord's Bombers and Movers? This is Landlord's deep, dark soul-- 'friends, there is no friend'. And anytime I can summon up the heartless callousness of my inner Gordon Gecko I would be more than happy not only to play, but delighted to demolish my opponents' buildings full of single mothers and their crying babies.

The guys love this "screw your neighbor game" but I found missing that something. We play it with cheapass money for scoring so, I can't help but draw parallels to CG. If they were closet nihilists. Deliciously un-P.C. Not for young kids unless you want to address lots of hairy moral questions.

RATING: N/A
A fun little "take that" card game, where you build apartment buildings, then populate them with crazy tenants, which provide income. Lots of crazy stuff goes on, musicians drive existing renters away, celebrities increase your revenue, old folks only live on the bottom floor, and squatters drive everyone away. Or, I can play event cards and just Evict your tenants, Murder them, or just Bomb the entire building. :ninja:

The artwork in this game is truly delicious, which is a big part of the fun. The scientist is experimenting on a lab rat with a buzzsaw. The Celebrities have a coke sniffing tube in their nose. The alibi card is an orgy, the student is watching porn, the police are machine gunning some likely innocent victim.

I was fortunate enough to snag a copy of the Abacus English edition, which has all this great artwork I described above that the European version has, but is still in full English. The Rio Grande US version has been sanitized completely.

Тема хороша, но игра хаотична и механика в ней тоже слишком зависит от пришедших на руку карт. Выигрышная стратегия одна - накупать (благо, ограничения на руку нет) карты, а затем всех опускать. 

С хомрулом "8 карт на руках" становится чудесной.

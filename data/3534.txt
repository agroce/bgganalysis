With Ares #12.  From Ebay, 07/10/06.  Unpunched.  This is the transition issue from SPI to TSR.  Very hard to find.  The game can be use to support the Universe RPG from SPI.

This goes down for my vote as 'most obscure great game ever.'  It is just an amazing combination of combat, politics, economics, neat rules.  It has everything in a compact game.

The economcics system is intricate and it works as a game, a very complex system.  amazing that they got it so well in a subscription game.  You can do it all here -own warehouses, do transport, try to extort, etc.

RATING: 8
Takes the Business Management model for supply and demand
(hidden bidding ect) and adds the key concept of transportation
(reducing the effect of production).

This makes the game a far more believable simulation of
market forces - BUT, a much harder game to actually
bring to a conclusion. In the end, games are won/lost
by very random event chits. The profit margins are just
too low to get a player to victory conditions in any
reasonable amount of time.

The military situation opens up the possibility to 
go for a 'race to the bottom' strategy - but it is 
not mandatory (as it is in Business Management).

Overall, a very intriguing design, that frays a bit
at the edges, but the core largely holds up. Unfortunately,
the choice of 'fixing' the slow pace of commercial gains
in a competitive environment via random event chits
ends up turning the game into a largely dissatisfying 
situation - which is further aggravated by the secret 
events being somewhat recognizable by their requirements.
Still, a favorite game concept, even if the execution 
doesn't completely work.

I have fond memories of this game which features a wealth of options and a complex economical engine if I recall correctly. We played it to death, but it was eons ago...
I don't know how it compares to modern designs so it is rated more on a nostalgia basis.

RATING: 4
Lots of interesting ideas. The ability to customize ships, the market system, the market advantage, business/political/criminal connections, reputation, sabotage, factories, warehouses. It all seems like it ought to be really cool.

Unfortunately it's all brought down by a clever but tedious market system that's a pain to get through. The real game breakers, however, are the wildly chaotic and potentially fatal random events. These were just not well thought out and can effectively knock you out of the game early.

So, a good game to borrow ideas from, or even streamline for a future version, but not really playable as written.

It is because of this game I decided to become an economist. It was in 1986 - in deep communism the laws of demand and supply were quite a discovery for me.
However, after we got the computers and there are many other innovative systems for the boardgames, it has lost it appeal. Too many details, too many dice rolling, too laborious for little effect.

 A full game will take close to 8 hours. 
Maybe the game is too ambitious because it is crammed with extra stuff besides the market.

But that makes the game also so interesting to play. I have a pretty good idea how the market works and how to exploit it. The other stuff I need more time to figure out.

Wow, this one is a very good economic game.  There is a lot of dice rolling, but it seems to work pretty well.  Lots of aspects to consider; agents, sabotage, warehousing items, smuggling, political connections, all of it is there.  We need to learn how to move things along more smoothlu, but this could be a top 20 game.

The best economic simulator in nerd game history. Yes, it was SPI: Ugly utilitarian board, ugly boring counters, dry lifeless rule book (but sweet comic!), etc... Yes it came in a magazine which means the counter mix is woefully too small, and it was in dire need of more events chits.

Doesn't matter. Awesome game, awesome design. Classic in all respects. I have many copies and am always looking for more.

RATING: 6
Some good ideas here: the economic track for each planet, buying "connections" (criminal, political etc.) enabling you to get a peak at certain event chits coming up. As always, combat seems to mess up the fun of making your fortune as a trader. Includes rules for linking to SPI's Universe RPG.

RATING: 3
So, I picked up this game because I had seen it described as similar to Merchant of Venus and someone actually said it's what Merchant should have been. I can't disagree more.

After two plays, we may not have completely explored the strategy of the game, but since it takes so long to get moving, I can't build up the desire to do so. I keep getting flashbacks of Die Macher.

So, there are really cool elements in this game. The concept of reputation is great, I love the way the markets respond to trading, and the whole connections and news stuff is pretty cool. The problem is that trading (the core of the game) is almost impossible to make any serious profit with. You have to buy above market value if you want to have a chance to get anything, and sell below market value for the same reason. If you're lucky, you can make 2-3HT per item sold.

The criminal opportunities in the game offer the best profits, but they show up randomly and taking advantage of them is extremely risky, as in lose your ship and get pretty much knocked out of the game risky.

Add to this the fact that so many of the aspects of the game have irritating arithmetic to do (e.g. if you attack a ship and want to salvage its cargo, a cool idea by the way, you have to roll two dice, subtract two, and multiply by ten to get the percentage of the cargo that you can salvage). Now this isn't terribly difficult, but it's not easy to remember and it's cumbersome, and this is just one example from the game.

In the end, they built an extremely detailed game that incorporated many cool aspects of ship building and upgrading, combat, trading and diplomacy, but it's just too cumbersome a game to really enjoy. If you enjoy games with high levels of detail that will literally take all day, then you should check this out. Otherwise, find yourself a copy of Merchant of Venus.

I don't think there's a better economics game out there. The supply and demand system works like a dream, permitting manipulation of markets and all sorts of tricks. There are many, many options, but I like the way the game rewards commodity trading rather than piracy and ship trading. The random event chits can unhinge things a little, but make the whole influence-peddling side work well. I umpired a PBM game of this many years ago and it translates smoothly to play by mail format.

Have been playing regular games by moderated PBEM with either 6 or 8 players since 2010. The 8 player version adds 2 extra planets and 2 additional commodities. This version (4th revision) is very close to the original but has been adapted for PBEM play and includes roughly double the number of opportunities and events compared to the Ares game. Games tend to last in the area of 15-20 turns for both the Basic game and Corporation game.

Being myself an economist, this is one of the games that fascinate me most, in this case for its S/D mechanisms.
Being a SF-RPG fan (Traveller, Firefly) I appreciate SPI Universe background.
So I would rate it very high... if I ever manage to actually play it!

This is what Merchants of Venus should have been.  The supply/demand economics are very well done.  Ditto the combat system and salvage rules. They key to keeping it playable is a good sequence of events play aid (such as Die Macher or even Civilization have). Be warned that this is a simulation game with dice (so randomness outside your control can hurt you) -- but good playing and cooperating with the right players will win out.

My current circle of players is such that I haven't played this one is awhile.  I need to work on that.

I'm playing with my local rule.  No combat, less profitable traveller business, more favorable economic events.  Even with this modification, this game is not so profitable.  Very severe business game.  I love this game best in the business game line-up.

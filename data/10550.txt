Easy to teach, plays quickly and supports a lot of players, with mild educational value. An ideal game club game, although less appealing to some than more thematic choices.

My other favorite word game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The best word game I’ve played, just beating ‘What’s my Word’ which probably has a lot to do with the scalability of Big Boggle. The extra dice lead to more variation and a minimum of 4 letter words make this game a bigger challenge. Very enjoyably game that I feel will see a lot of miles. I predict this will be my most played game this time next year.

This is way better than Boggle.  The best part is that you don't have to waste your time looking for mind-numbing three letter words like 'sot' to keep your brother-in-law from beating you.

RATING: 9.5
I have been playing Big Boggle for over 30 years and I never tire of it. Every game is always different and with large groups this is a BLAST! What a great party game. My kids grew up playing this and I can tell you that the game has the hidden element of helping a childs vocabulary, so that is a big plus to the  parents out there. A great learning tool for kids. The other thing I loved about the game was my wife, who is not a gamer, loves it and loves to play it! That's good for me. VERY GOOD. One of my all-time favorite games.

Boggle, but BIG! I like word games and the larger grid (5x5 instead of 4x4) allows for many more word possibilities.

Immediately trashed (downsized) the box.
This version comes with an elbow-shaped cover that covers 2 edges of the "board", limiting play to a regular-Boggle-sized 4x4 grid of letters.

RATING: 7
Like Boggle, but bigger! The extra letters give players more options, and the four-letter minimum helps avoid the lame three letter words. I prefer to disallow plurals (I enjoy finding unique words, not adding -s to the ends of my words) and to disallow claiming any word that the player is not reasonably confident [i]is[/i] a word. Big Boggle is a fun challenge once in a while, and a game I'm always happy to play even if I would usually suggest something else instead. (2011-02)

Definitely a cut above Boggle in my book.  Longer words are more interesting, and prevents some of the repetition of the same old words again and again (art, rat, tar).

this version is more conducive to longer words.

RATING: 9
50 plays

(Version we have is "Boggle Deluxe", which is normal Boggle but the grid is 5 by 5. "Big Boggle" actually has a "double letter" cube with "he", "ar", etc., which sounds kinda lame.)

If your crowd is wordy, this is an absolute must. You will attract everyone if you just start playing; no one ever says "that's enough Boggle for me". 5x5 is the perfect size... we play with a 4-letter minimum, so the real joy comes from the few longer words that emerge each round.

One of the ultimate "the more, the merrier"-type group games, for the beach, family reunions, etc.

The 5x5 version is crucial! You won't go back to 4x4.

I love good word games, and my love for this game stretches back to childhood. However, a few year stint of the online version catapulted me into an insane level. My wife likes playing this, but we mutually agreed not to count it in our statistics, because of the supremely unbalanced nature of victories.

Heaps of nostalgia and very a fun word game. Have very vivid memories of playing this game with my Nan and her friends when I was a kid, and we still play it to this day. Absolutely love it - and a game I expect I will always enjoy playing.

RATING: 9
Bigger the boggle, the more the fun.  I like this larger version more than the original.  More potential for larger words.  We play that only 4 letters+ allowed.

Jan 2011:  Upped to a 9 from 8.  Wife and I have been playing this a ton, and it's fun to see improvement over time.

RATING: 8
considering how much I love boggle I'm surprised I don't love this even more... amazing how just one more row of letters and it becomes a big mess for me, but my family prefers this version since I'm a bit handicapped it's a much closer game (I still win though)

So simple, and the scoring is pretty brilliant, where you only ever score points if you find a word that no one else has.  The best part is that there's no silly gimmicks or special rules to pay attention to, it's just pure word seeking, which is definitely what I want out of a word game.

Also, it makes more noise than any other game.

I like this so much better than scrabble because it's quick paced, there's no downtime, and players don't have an advantage based on the tiles they draw since everyone is essentially playing with the same ones.

My father was so into Boggle that he bought nine copies of Big Boggle, glued them together for a 15x15 board, and would play one hour rounds with a seven letter word minimum. He probably played thousands of games that way with his ex over the years. While I don't have the patience to play hour long rounds of Boggle, I do enjoy playing on a 5x5 or 6x6 board for 5 minutes with a five letter minimum.

Plays just like regular Boggle except that minimum word size is 4 letters.  Comes with a piece with two legs joined at a right triangle in order to cover an outermost column/row in order to play the traditional 4x4 Boggle grid.  Just like regular Boggle, this could use a piece of thick cloth in the top of the lid to reduce the noise while shaking.

I love this game. Easily my favorite word game, I don't see this leaving the collection any time soon. 3 minutes of pattern recognition and puzzle solving.

We have the white/orange box version with the flashing-light timer built in. I prefer the bigger Boggle over the normal as it's a little less of a scribble fest as you dash down all of the 3-letter words. I must try the suggestion of restricting words to 5-letters in the biiger version and 4-letters in the normal to further this effect.

I remember playing this with my Nannie growing up, so I have some nostalgia for it. But, it also feels like good brain training. Plus, it's interesting how many words can be hidden in plain sight.

I like Boggle Master more than regular Boggle because the letter grid is bigger, so there are longer, more interesting words to be discovered.

What everyone says about Big Boggle is correct: It's way better than regular Boggle. Bigger words equals more fun. I find I'm not that good at it, which makes me want to play it more. It's a nice challenge, quick moving, and 50 point games are over in a couple rounds. On the downside, player interaction is nonexistent. But so what, it's fun. A classic for good reason. As of January 2012, it's back in print, so go get it!

Good evolution of the basic game ([gameid=1293]).

The basic premise is more cubes to work with, but only 4+ letter words count.

We found this to be a good version for the family as "junior" players can be allowed to score 3 letter words, while experienced players words of 4 or more letters.

The ultimate word game!  Bigger than Boggle, and the length limit reflects the difference in board size.  This eliminatesz the three letter words that are often scored in Boggle and provides more opportunities for long 7-9 letter words.  But ambidexterous still does not come up very often.

This is a very quick game that I enjoy.  This is much better than Boggle because it allows you to play Boggle with it if you want and gives you more letters and a bigger grid for bigger words.

A streamlined rule set which puts Knizia to shame.   Larger board allows for finding larger words.  Some board configurations can drag on a bit as there are few common words available.  Near-endless replayability.

RATING: 8.3
Number of players: 2+

Components: (9)
I think this probably varies depending on which version a person purchases. In the version that I own, the dice and easily read and the tray holds them all well. However, there was a moderate flaw with my copy; the hour glass sometimes gets clogged. You don’t have time to look for this during a game, but it’s frustrating to HAVE to. 

Rules: (10)
Just look for words. They have to be 4 letters or more. They can go in in direction, they can be all bent up. That’s pretty much it. 

Setup: (10)
Shake the tray to randomize the dice.

Area required to play: (10)
Hold a notebook and play this on the couch if you want.
 
Fun: (7)
It’s pretty good. I wouldn’t think this would be something that most people would want to play for hours and hours nightly, but it’s something good to get off the shelf once in awhile.

Theme Integration / Mechanics: (10)
There is no theme, but the mechanic to Boggle has been tried and proven.

Replay Value: (10)
Infinite. The language keeps getting larger.

Storage: (8)
This is another game with a pretty small box that still ends up being too large for the game. 

Accessibility: (9)
A child old enough to read can play this game. They may not be good at it, they may no enjoy it, but they could understand it and play independently.

A timed word game where players attempt to find as many connected words as possible from the face up letters resting in a 25 cube grid.

Un buen juego de palabras, pero uno en el que es imposible ganar si no tienes la habilidad requerida (siempre de los siempres pierdo contra mi novia).

01/08/2013: This is another "classic" from my past.  I've enjoyed this game since I was a kid.  Despite the fact that I don't think I have a very good vocabulary, I seem to do well at this game.  I think it has to do with the spacial / puzzle element of connecting letters all around the grid to form various words.  The key is to always look for those words where you can add on the plural as well as the singular.  Past tense is a good one too.  Another fun, simple family / party game for those non-gamers and word game fans.

Ok folks, you can call me crazy, but this is one of my top favourite games !! It´s one of my five games for the trip to "lonely island". Especially the "wife-factor" is very high. Moreover the game is a brainer in this version (be sure to get the big one, which is called "Maxi Boggle" in Germany by the way). It is fast to play and causes lots of fun, if you like any sort of crossword puzzles, etc.

Love this game!  But you need a bunch of fellow wordnerds, the type that simultaneously go "oooooooo" when someone finds an eight or nine-letter word and are equally amused by sticking the suffix -er onto any and all verbs, to really have fun with this.  I've been looking for this ever since my Sunday Big Boggle group from college moved away and the local game store told me it was out of print.

Big Boggle takes some getting used to if, like me, you played alot of the regular game.  With minimum scoring allowed for 4 letter words (not 3 letters like the original), this shift means a bit more searching for viable words.

I like this game fine, but prefer standard Boggle.  Bigger is not always better unless you're one of those variant Bogglers who don't allow 3-letter (or, horrors, 4-letter) words.  If you're one of those silly folk, then you'll love the more expansive grid.  Me, I love the fact that someone who doesn't make BINGOs in Scrabble can compete in this game with all those three letter strings that make a word in both directions.

I really like this, but the problem is that your skill in the game depends on how your brain is wired, and you can't really improve.  Example:  in 2003 (the year we got the game) my wife and I played 45 times.  I won 38 of them.  She's a very intelligent person, she just thinks differently than I do.  It might be fun to play again, but she'd probably lose, so we haven't played yet in 2004.  I think it got pulled out for a few games in 2005.

On its own Boggle is merely a good party game. But with house rules like minimum 7-letter words, no plurals, etc, this really becomes a brain-burning social activity that I just love.

I like words, so I kind of like Boggle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like Big Boggle about as much I like standard Boggle.  Its interesting that the rules eliminate the three-letter words which were the staple of 4x4 Boggle, but in most situations, the increased word-grid provided for many more word opportunities.

Not the Biggest Boggle fan (hah!)  Will gladly play if someone suggests it, though.

RATING: 6.5
Easier to handicap than regular Boggle.  Let kids have the 3 letter words -- adults need 4 or more letters.

Much better/more strategic game with 3 players.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Better than the original because it allows for 4+ letter words more easily than Boggle.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Bigger and better than regular Boggle, mainly because of the four letter word requirement.  I like having more dice too.  In fact, more dice in any game is almost always a good thing.  If I ever beat Karen Ford my life will be complete.  She's so good it Boggles the mind.

I love Boggle, it is my favorite word game.  Big Boggle is even better.  The minimum number of letters for words is 4 but you also get an extra row/column of letters to work with (for 9 extra letters).  In this copy there is also a cube with two letters on each side (the standard Qu, but also In, He, etc.)

I like this version a little bit better, you have to work harder for words and you have more to work with as well.  Still my favorite word game.

Big Boggle  It's like boggle except bigger!  ...and bigger is almost always better.  It is true in this case as well.  I like boggle enough to play it with non-gamers and Big Boggle takes it up a notch.  It uses a 5x5 grid of letter instead of the 4x4 grid of the original.  The minimum length word allowed has been increased to a four letter word.  They include a letter die that has two letters on the die, so now "QU" and "TH" are on the die faces making more and longer words possible.   If you like Boggle, check it out.

As a lover of word games, This is a superb game that requires little time, unlike scrabble, and can be played as many or as few times as desired. Basically a sandbox wordsearch game. Also try to find this 5x5 grid version. It is much more fun than the 4x4 which gets really boring really fast.

I'm rubbish at regular Boggle, getting only 3-4 letter words usually, with 5 letter ones occasionally. Taking points away for the 3 letter ones really hurts.

It isn't that I'm a bad speller, but I just don't see the words on the board. I don't know why my brain doesn't work that way.

RATING: 7
I grew up loving Boggle. I don't know that this version is a major improvement over the original, but it does allow you to stretch your word-finding skills to longer words.

As with the original, players of different skill levels don't necessarily play well together.

I love word games (I was an English major), and I like this and Scrabble probably because they give me a chance to show off my vocabulary and usually stomp all my opponents.  :-)

EDIT:  Okay.  It's been a few years, and stomping has lost its appeal, so I've lowered my rating.

At first I disliked the larger board and four-letter minimum of Big Boggle, but with practice (enforced at the internet site where I used to play) it eventually became my preferred format for Boggle.

RATING: 5.5
[Parker Electronic 'Super Boggle' 2003 edition] {dice, word; dice-rolling, word recognition, paper-and-pencil; optimal 4-8p} I am not really a fan of word games but I think it's a good game for English learners in building vocabulary; esp. for colleague students. However, it's easy to have a sure winner. Skilful and experienced players usually win but he may not be the one with best vocabulary.

Boggle is a quiet game and lacks strong player interaction because everyone is writing individually. Nevertheless, it is still entertaining when players are discussing their lists of words to figure out familiar patterns of each player, learn new words and find out missing words on the board. I think the replay value of Big Boggle is low because I found that most words are repeating throughout the games.

One should buy Big Boggle rather than Boggle because short words (3 characters) help little in building vocabulary and Big Boggle can be played as normal Boggle as well.

The 1979 version.  This is a fun game, always brought out with wordy family members.  Big Boggle is a big step up from Boggle.

My wife loves Boggle so I play it with her.  I'm not a big fan, but I will say that I like Big Boggle way more than the basic version.  I love the dice with 2 letters on them as that really opens things up.

I rate it a 6.  I honestly think that I would rate it higher if I had tougher competition.  When we play, its just a word finding exercise and nothing more.

This was surprisingly fun to rediscover, after distinctly not liking it during my youth.  If I recall correctly, my mom used to slaughter us as kids, which may or may not have led to my dislike of Boggle.  Still, lots of fun now, and the bigger 5x5 grid of Big Boggle can lead to long words.

Excellent word game.  Players adept in finding lots of four or five letter words can easily compete with players spending more time looking for 7 & 8 letter words.  Don't bother playing regular Boggle unless you want to play with ten year olds.

The phone app is better since you can see how many words could have been made, which is helpful to get better at the game.

Much better with the 5x5 grid. You can still use three letter words if you like. The 3 minute timer is way too long in my opinion - about half that time seems about right.

My wife and I have a natural affinity to word games and have many fond memories with Boggle.  I found Big Boggle at a thrift store and we played it a few times.  It definitely made for a much wider variety of words but it also took out some of the tension/difficulty in the game because there were so many more word possibilities which meant less overlap between players which is where Boggle really shines for my wife and I...trying to find those few words that the other person misses.  So Big Boggle eventually went away.

It's a word game.  I'm not into word games.  To each his own, I guess.  Necessity of more than three letter words makes it better than [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1293]regular Boggle[/url], though.  I play it a lot when I go home because my mother loves it.

A game my wife and I both enjoy.  Unlike Scrabble (which we also play, but FAR more seldom) in Boggle, your opponent can not only deny you points for words, but also almost invariably will have some words to themselves to hang their hat on.  I think that's the one factor that's kept us coming back to this game... often enough that we now prefer the BIG Boggle Variety to the simpler original.  I can't imagine ever NOT wanting to play this.

After 2+ Plays: Loved boggle until I played this.  Now, I doubt I would ever play regular boggle again.  A lot more variety when you're looking for 4 letter words.  With regular boggle, you would be finding the same 3 letter words every game.

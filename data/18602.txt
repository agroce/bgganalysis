RATING: 5
"Caylus... I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we're not meant for each other, our expectations are so different and, probably, incompatible." 
"Can we still be friends?" 
"I doubt it."

To make it short: too long for what it has to offer, too fiddly and somewhat dry. It works, no doubt about it, but of all the optimization games I tried, this is the one that gets closest to solving an equation. 
Give me Goa any day of the week.

"It's not you, Caylus, it's me."

Finally got to play this and wow its a brain-burner on your first go.  Just the rules explanation went a long way to melting my brain.  Great to see the multiple paths to victory.  Now to try to get my mind around the strategies.  Based on 1 play.  I expect my rating to rise if I play more.
Only bad thing - it takes ages to play - for 5 of us it went on over 3 hours.  Too long for me.

Update: I think I just don't enjoy heavy euros. Where is the fun? Downgraded to a 4.

RATING: 7
Rating based on one turn-based game on BGA (which remains unfinished after 2 months!), so might not be a fair rating yet. 

Getting anything done feels very arduous and convoluted. Will probably have a rules refresher after this game and play again in real time to get a better feel for it. Still, I can't see this being one we pick up, I just want to give it a fair trial.

RATING: 10
Hmm. I would like to give this a 9 because my game preferences are getting heavier and this obviously is innovative and deep but it stays an 8 because it is beyond my strategic comprehension. I admire it tremendously but I can't get my head round how you win or even half the time how you go about trying to win.

Update: Spent one whole summer playing it. Now a 10. Absolutely brilliant. Whole provost/bailiff time management thing is intriguing. So much depth. Excellent with 2.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A "gamer's game" with no luck, multiple paths to victory, and alot of very well designed interlocking ideas/parts, despite the generally unoriginal theme.  

This is a placement game, where you have to make tough decisions (including economic) as to where to place your workers, and they cost money to place, which is tight through alot of the game (potentially).  Do you collect resources (essential for building), do you build buildings (useful for scoring points, generating more points when others use your buildings, and provides a cheap building location for yourself), do you work on the castle (required for scoring points, and gaining royal favours, and also required or you lose points), do you try to rack up royal favours in the joust square, do you want to dirty other players (or prevent yourself from being dirtied) by controlling the provost, do you even have enough money to do anything?  

The tight economics, tile-laying strategy, resource management, perfect balance, and multiple options make this about as deep as it gets for a Euro.

The only real negatives are that it's a bit long (this can be bad when you're 30+ points behind, and there's an hour left to play), and although it plays 2-5, and is an outstanding 2-3 player game, you have to force me to play 4 players and I refuse to subject myself to a grinding 5-player game.

I think the only problem with this game is that, given the incremental nature of it and the similarities between each turn, a more experienced player will simply stomp on newer players each and every turn. It's not a runaway leader problem, but it can be disheartening to simply be unable to do anything meaningful due to the overwhelming amount of stuff going on.

130929 I've come to really dislike worker placement games.  Caylus is maybe a touch heavy for my typical playing preference but the fact I am willing and interested in playing this must account for something.  This really is the only WP game I'd happily play.  Though I still dislike the mechanism such that I haven't felt the need to purchase the game....

120102 I like it more and more every time!  

After playing a few other worker placement games, I've come to really appreciate how they kept the mechanisms streamlined to be primarily focused on just the worker placement and avoided adding too much area control or set collection.  Just a beautifully balanced finely tuned game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Just the first game and can't say the rules are simple but love it! Corrected some misreadings and the second game was enjoyable.

Replayed the game after five years and so many different worker-placement games, must say that; "Caylus is still the loverly King of Worker-placement".

This Christmas, Caylus picked up where Settlers of Catan left off, pulling some non-game-playing friends a little further into the Euro game genre. We played our first two games on Christmas Eve, with two or three more planned for tonight.

August 2012 update: nobody in my group ever wants to play it. They say it's dry. :/

RATING: 6
Down from 8 to 6. A fine game, but I've lost my interest in playing it. In the long run the fairly low replay value, long play time and WP player screwage are weighing it down. 

Caylus is a brilliant design that epitomises the worker placement genre. At first glance it appears overwhelmingly complex, but there is a method to the madness and learning the mechanics and strategies is an interesting challenge. Once you do that, though, the game becomes an increasingly tedious and repetitive analysis-paralysis excercise.

Like most WP games, the main interaction comes from blocking other players and making mistakes is very costly. Caylus also has many mechanics that punish you for mistakes and by which the other players may screw you over. This can be very frustrating and causes serious AP issues as players try to calculate everything and avoid making a mistake while trying their best to calculate what others might be doing and how to wreck their plans. 

The game is very long (too long!) and playing it makes me feel like I just ran a marathon. It is challenging and interesting in a masochistic way. The game experience is highly frustrating and the only times the suffering feels justified is when you win. 

The iPhone app version is very well done. It has nice graphics and cuts the play time and bookkeeping down nicely. It still feels just as fiendishly frustrating to play as the original. Worth the money for everyone who enjoys the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I prefer Pillars of the Earth or Le Havre, personally (the kids take to these games much easier). No offense to any die-hard Caylus lovers out there. I DO find this an interesting play, and with more plays, it should rise in stature in my eyes. I like the fact that there's perfect information and no luck. It is brilliant in this regard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really, really enjoy this game.  People say it's old school now, but we still get it to the table several times a year.  Tight and brain burning, trying to figure out which prestige buildings you can/will build.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I especially like how setting up the 6 neutral buildings randomly at the beginning of each game affects the whole flavour of each individual game. It contributes to a high replayability, high complexity for determining optimal strategies, without randomization. This is one of the reasons I think this one will be played for a long time. The rules were remarkably clear for a game this complex (2nd edition).

In my opinion, it has a similar feel than both puerto rico (production building cash victory points cycle) and in the shadow of the emperor (selecting opportune favors, trying to place "better" than other players in castle building in each turn, buying worker placement vs. buying elector placement).

After a weekend of playing, my initial impression is that I like it better for 2 players than 3. In a 2 against 1 scenario there is not much that can be done against the provost, so there it can possibly be frustrating at times. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
after two plays. 1 3-player, 1 5-player. really liked the progressive scoring and lots and lots of options. HATED the coalition building that happened occasionally, it was such a small part of the game but could have such a big impact, led to king-making and a bad feeling all-around.

Caylus is my gateway game, no fooling! My profile (and number of plays) shows how much I love it. (Why has Caylus slipped from my #1? Just the fact that I don't play it often because it is not as engaging when you play with less enthusiastic players.) But there's nothing like it when you're in the mood for its lax theme and abstract economy!

Best Ystari game and one of the best eurogame. Many ways to collect points. There is a lot of strategic decisions, indirect interaction and fun of course. The game that you want to play again and again, to try different strategies and that gives a lot of satisfaction for the winner.

Bought it, played it, sold it. A perfectly reasonable game but its array of mechanics and game length meant that Caylus was for gamers only and mostly going to sit on the shelf. Removing one mechanism (if that were possible) might produce more focused gameplay. I'll happily play other people's copies.

2 plays / 3,5 players

LIKE: Tight resource game. great action selection track. Love how players can pass on their round to increase the action cost to others.
DISLIKE: if you are new, the combo strategies can be used against you. Lots of little rules with the building.
OVERALL: Great game, worthy of it's classic status. I felt the 5 players was great. My first game was fast, the Provost rarely went backwards. The game can get cutthroat, which increases the interaction, but could frustrate some players.

RATING: 9
Wow.  This was one of the first heavier strategy games I played and it blew me away.  As I've played more games, I still think this is one of the best designs out there.  The game is too dry for some, but the depth is impressive.  The sweet spot is definitely 3 player, but 2 and 4 are still very good.  

My two complaints about the game are that it overstays its welcome if players aren't moving the Provost forward and that the building favours track eliminates the need to construct certain buildings.

boring, clunky game play
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Rather complicated in really just one way: there are alot of buildings with a variety of costs and implications. So each turn is truly full of options - and that can make for slow play. Still, very tasty in the amount of options each turn - lots of paths to try out. Additional plays continue to show this game to be very good indeed.

Este es un JUEGAZO en toda regla xD Euro durillo con una mecánica brillante y padre de muchos otros sucedáneos de colocación de trabajadores no tan pulidos. Juego de planificar y pensar mucho, absolutamente nada dependiente de la suerte. La edición deluxe no me gusta el diseño interior y es muy cara. Funciona diferente pero perfecto, para cualquier numero de jugadores de 2-5, eso sí el juego cambia mucho con 2, con 3, o 4-5.

A game with a lot of tough decisions. My GF's favourite game.


2013/01
Update - Caylus was one of the first meaty games I picked up and I still love it. I'm a bit hesitant to put it on the table, though, because it is prone to dragging on forever. If everything goes well, a game can be finished in less than 2 hours but I've witnessed over 5 hour games, too. Should that happen, it kills the game completely.

Too much counting, this game made me realise that I'm not a big friend of euro-games. The reason for the low rating is that I don't want to play this anymore.

RATING: 6.5
Too boring for me. It's completely dry and very chess-like (perfect information game and apart from the player order at the start, completely luck-free). I guess if you are interested in calculating a lot of things, you may like it but it's too complex for me to be entertaining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I'm really split on this game.  I'll see where my thoughts go the more I play it.  So far, I've actually enjoyed it and yet...there are a few things about it I normally don't much care for in games: lack of player interaction (there's only the possibility of stitching another player up by combined Provost movement), overly puzzle-like game play, systematic procedures, lack of strategy (there's plenty of short term planning and the chance to have a starting aim - eg I'll go for gold or Castle building - but that's it).  Like most of this sort of game, keeping on top of your money supply is absolutely critical.

Other negatives are that some of the artwork is really dull and the game takes too long...3 to 4 hours depending how much AP there is.  If this was playable in 2.5 hours, it would be better for what it is - still, I suppose we've got Pillars of Earth (which I found vastly inferior) and Yspahan (which I like) for that.

And yet, I did like this, so what gives?  It must have something to save it from those faults above.

Hmm (scratches head)...I think it's the fact that there is SO much to think about.  Ok, so it's a bit puzzle-like and there is a system (buy this to get that), but even so, within that there seems to be a labyrinthine structure which I quite enjoyed.  And I like brain-burning games if they're not too unforgiving (that's where AoS falls down like a building in an earthquake for me).  In this one, you're never quite sure who's going to win because you can look behind and then come from nowhere.  Certain paths are slower burning than others.  I like that unpredictability - it makes up for the fact that there is no randomness in this (save for the set up).

So yeah, the game is a bit like problem solving, and normally that can be very dull, and yet, the problem solving here is so intriguing that I ended up liking it despite myself.

Even so, if the game was quicker and had just a wee bit more interaction, it would rate better for me.

A little bit more play has seen me raise this from a 7.5 to an 8.5

Caylus was far from the first worker placement game I've played, but even without a sense of novelty, I can see why it's considered a classic. Multiple paths to victory, lots of difficult decisions, and repeated plays are rewarded with better performances. I've only played the game with two players, and while it's still great fun, I suspect it's even better with more players.

Very well, there is really no luck elements in this game and it feels a lot like playing multiplayer chess where every move requires considerable thinking. That said, the game doesnt really feel that fun to play, it is difficult to teach, slow to play and feels very 'scripted'. Dont get me wrong, this game is a "masterpiece" mechanics wise and I'm giving it the rating I do because of the strategic thinking required when playing. But it definitely doesnt tickle my soft spots.

My favorite worker placement game. The concept of the game is wonderful and the way each and every building and piece is placed on the board is brimming with flavor. Despite a long and complicated set of rules you are not always going to be doing everything at once and most of the phases of the game are far more simple than they seem to be. If anything bad can be said about this game is that there are often moments where someone is bribing the provost to screw over another player, but just the fact that you can bankrupt yourself to guarantee another player doesn't jump too far ahead is amazing.

It's really a good game as Puerto Rico, as the rule is really depends on other players and sequence of play can be changed, so it's more flexible then Puerto Rico.

I haven't ever played this one against someone who had my level of ignorance about the upcoming buildings, and as a result it's never been much fun for me.  Of course, plenty of Euro games are only fun if everyone's learning them at the same rate, so this is hardly a fault in the game, but it genuinely affects my desire to play this one.

Theme is pasted on.  Fairly easy game to learn and play.  Game play is like work and similar to many eurogames.  Mechanics are also similar to many eurogames (worker placement, building with resources, variable turn order); however, there is one new, semi-interesting mechanic.  Game play is also fairly balanced.  Game length is a little longer than typical euros but OK.  Components were excellent.

RATING: 9.2
An exciting game if played with a group of friends who likes brain draining games.  This game makes you think a lot, 1 wrong move may led to losing many prestige points in the game.

It is also important to take note of the order on the activation of buildings, as it is always forgotten by players.

Good points: Many dimensions to the game, you need money to place the workers, resources to build buildings as well as the castle.  Royal favours can be really useful in the game too.  Provost is a good way to slow down a player's progress

Bad points: Nothing bad I can really pinpoint about except that it can really be brain draining.

After thought: A game that is really fun if you are a serious gamer, however i doubt that it will appeal to casual gamers.  My favourite game to this point of time and I would really recommend to all serious gamers.

I finally played Caylus, and I must say that I like it better than Puerto Rico. Caylus is fairly balanced - one wrong move won't take you completely out of the game, since you receive money at the beginning of every round that you can use to place one or more workers on a building. The board is also intuitive (esp. vs. Puerto Rico).

Howver, my bf felt that he was "out of the game "pretty early, and thus didn't really enjoy playing. He says that it suffers from the Power Grid factor (slow, dull, and uninteresting). I can see why he says this, but we're both willing to give the game another go. 

*** UPDATE: I lowered my rating because my husband will never play this game again and I don't care for it that much. I much prefer Cuba and Agricola for my worker placement fix. ***

Clásico juego de gestión de recursos, ambientado en la Europa medieval. Los jugadores han de colocar trabajadores en los diferentes edificios para contribuir a la construcción de un castillo. El juego es perfecto para 2-3 jugadores, a 4 ó 5 se descontrola bastante. Funciona muy bien, hay muchas estrategias a seguir, cero azar y bastante interacción entre los jugadores. Como nota negativa creo que en determinadas partidas al que se queda a la cola le cuesta mucho alcanzar al resto de los jugadores, es un juego que no perdona los fallos, pero jugado con gente que sepa jugarlo es una maravilla.Es un juego muy rápido de desplegar, que ocupa poco espacio en la mesa y que se disfruta desde el primer turno.
Uno de mis favoritos sin ninguna duda.

RATING: 6
Good game. But chunkiness. When I play it, I feel a lack of continuum. "Place workers. Execute special buildings. Move the provost. Execute all other buildings. Build the castle. Get the favor. Next round. Same thing." Not that this makes anything bad with the game itself, but it leads more to a feeling of tedium and certainly prevents me from enjoying it more than I do. But what's worse is the main game: cube management. That's not bad: what's bad is that the game has lots of other things going on that it seems to hide the fact that it is a cube management game. Moral: if a game is about X, make it seem like it is about X. For cube and card management, Macao is a great example. It doesn't pretend to be something else.

So great game, but I'm inclined to play others, like Troyes and Luna!

RATING: 7
Early worker placement game with relatively straightforward scoring.  The fun comes from the unique Provost/Bailiff tokens that move up/down and activate buildings.  So you might be the first to build at the end of the line, but other players can prevent you from activating that building this turn and thereby ruin your plans.  This gives you more influence over your opponents than just taking up spaces for their workers.

I spend US$14 more to get the Essen edition (compared with the RGG version, which has lower price) of Caylus. What should I say? This is the best purchase I have had in 2005 (the other would be the Struggle of Empires by Mr. Martin Wallace). I would give a solid 10 after 2 plays.

RATING: 7
Solid worker placement with some good depth. Not anywhere near close to as 'complex' as its reputation makes it sound. Complex maybe for 2005. Certainly on par with other worker placements like Carson City or Age of Empires 3 in 2013 (if possibly even less complex than those). Still an interesting game with favor tracks, building options, and so forth.

2-5(3)

With two it's very tight. The game can be as rich or poor as you make it (depending on how soon players pass), and there are several strategies to pursue, and seemingly all of which require some attention. Castle batches, buildings (both production and point buildings), favors, etc. I like the perfect information, the breadth of the decision tree, the game of chicken, trying to plan a turn (grabbing the most desirable spots, often the production buildings) while risking a pass. The goods all have different applications but still seem reasonably balanced. Gold, hard as it is to get, seems really potent, though. Interesting how this takes a while but still moves quickly and often feels like it ends "too soon".

Some AP in going through all the buildings and, at least with two, the Provost is more a threat than anything (you're often very reluctant to pay to activate him).

Best game of the weekend for me.  At times I wanted it to go faster and faster (and we were no slouchs - 2h30 for a 5 player game).  At times I was so frustrated that I was virtually out of money and others had pots.  None of us had decent strategies worked out and in the end I came second due to two rounds were I built the most bits of tower. 

Also don't be put off by the rules.  They seem needlessly complicated to me.  When you start playing it is pretty straightforward.

My wife and I learned this together using BSW then found friends with a copy.  After playing fairly often for about a month I was impressed, but not ready to give it a 10.  We had a hiatus then played again the other day, and the game had won me over... I can now safely say that I will never turn down a game of Caylus (short of injury or childbirth or something like that).  It is deeper and more interactive than Puerto Rico without the player order bugs.  I'm a big fan of synergistic games with combinatorially many ways of combining components, but usually they suffer from some combinations being significantly stronger than others.  I have to be careful with that sentence because I think that many people might think that some combinations really are super-strong in Caylus (especially in 2p games), but I think that the game forces you to always interact with your opponents, it's not solitaire...  Anyway, this is the first 10 I've given out since my honeymoon period with board gaming.  I think I feel it strongly enough to want to downgrade some other rankings just to make this one stick out more.  I started to wonder why this game wasn't rated higher, but I saw a post saying it reached number 2 before some sort of backlash brought it back down to earth... This game is the chess/go of Eurogames, makes me feel like you could spend a long long time studying it and still finding depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Goodlooking game, but - as goes for so many eurogames - a collection of game mechanics to create fuzz in order to prevent players from determining an optimal strategy, so that the lesser gods can keep up. 

The provost is a game mechanic that doesn't really work. Players are rarely willing to pay for it and if they do if the occasion arrise it can have large consequences if you are in the wrong player order. Besides the major will move anyway. 

I don't like the pass mechanism, which makes labourers disproportionally more expensive. 

Caylus is not unpleasant to play and does have some strong game mechanics, such as the tile laying one. But I haven't seen any of the more expensive ones on the board and I wish  that this mechanic have been done in a more natural way. The reason? See the first paragraph! 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Amazing worker placement game. Very well balanced. The rules are quite easy to teach for a game this complex. The rulebook is very clear. Players are supposed to be master builders trying to build a castle for the King. The game is highly interactive. You can play with the turn order, with the game length and you can try to screw your opponents by using the provost pawn. Many paths to victory, many ways to score VPs, many options to choose from. The "King's favours" mechanic seems very interesting. The random initial setup adds a bit to the replayability. 
Minor issues: the theme is not as strong as I would like and keep in mind that some players might not like the provost mechanic cause it makes the game quite cutthroat (for a euro).

I liked the game immensely, but it wasn't as difficult as I expected it to be.  Since I have only played it once, that may change.  My strategy was simply to build a lot of buildings and make sure that we progressed two spaces every turn instead of one.  The quicker someone that invests a lot in early game can end it, the better it is for them, because no one has time to build the really expensive buildings.  Still a really great game, though.

The best euro for a highly competitive match because interaction is so important at every step of this game, and you can be quite mean.

A euro that fires on all levels and really scratches that competitive itch that you don't get with many other worker placement games.

This is not a strategy game, but a tactics game. Pattern recognition plays a heavy role and exploiting already existing situations is more important than planning.

The short version: Too many options very little depth.

What keeps me from giving a higher rating to this game is that I dont like the possibility to buy victory points with all resources whitout transforming them.  I also question the "worker placement" method in this game and all other games that use it as I am not convinced it makes an interesting system for the players. I also feel that is is too easy to build buildings, removing tension and stress in the game.

I’ve gone all out with this game! I’ve bought the second edition but have additionally bought: -

*The metal coins and black purse
*Larger 10mm resource cubes
*Gold bar tokens to replace the gold resource cubes
*A small compartmentalised storage container for the resources
*Extra houses as to not run out during a game
*Extra residencies
*The Jeweller tile
*Some favour tins to hold the tiles

Barring Chess and Go this is my favourite game! Next to no luck involved, tactics, strategy and different paths to victory, this game has it all. I’ve introduced this to my partner and she really enjoyed it, even stopping halfway through the game to tell me! I wish I could rate it higher but the scoring system I use won’t allow me to push it past my Chess and Go ratings. I chose this game over Agricola and I’m very happy with that decision. 

I want to play this game all the time and nothing else at the minute

Coming up to 800 plays on BSW

I've really slowed down my plays with this game over the last few months. To get any better at it is going to take work and study. I'm not prepared to do that at the moment. I'm playing other games again now.

Update: Dropped to an 8 for no other reason than I'm burned out on this and Euro's in general. It took nearly 800 plays to reach this point. Still a great game and the best Euro I've played.

I was quite surprised I liked this game considering there are no elements of luck involved. When I first heard the rules I thought it was going to be extremely complex and hard to play but after just one round I found it quite easy to get a grasp of the mechanics. I really enjoyed the different phases of the game and how each stage had an impact on the game. I’m already looking forward to my second play.

Great worker placement game that offers some tough choices. Provost adds a neat twist where workers can be screwed out of their actions by other players for the cost of some gold. Unfortunately the game does not play well with only 2-player so it sat unplayed for several years. Sold to make room.

RATING: 8
The rules seemed very complicated when I first read them, but in actual play the game turns out to be straightforward and quick-paced. When learning the game I recommend just setting up the board and playing a simulated turn as one reads the rules, instead of trying to read the rules first. I also like how nearly every rule is marked on the board with icons. And the multitude of wooden pieces accompanying the game is very nice to handle and behold. As for actual play, it is fun, but I haven't yet played enough to know what would be a good strategy for me, or how much fun it'd be once I figure that out.

{1 play, 5 players} I know everyone's CRAZY for this right now, but it hasn't grabbed me, yet.  Mind you, I'm not a big fan of games designed for this kind of long-term thinking, like Goa, for example (though I don't mind it all in Prince of Florence, and can't really say why).  I do want to try it again, though, and that's a good sign.  And though it was long (we took 3 hours), it never felt long, which is always a plus for games like this.

*** UPDATE ***

Well, it's been about two years now and this one did not come though.  There's just something "unfun" going on here, despite the cleverness of many of the mechanisms.  I should rate it lower, since I think I *would* actively avoid a game of this if it were starting up, but everything in it works (I don't even mind the "worthless" cube favor track), and it definitely feels different, so it gets a 6 out of respect.  However, it really feels long to me now, which it didn't before - never a good sign.  FWIW, I rarely see anyone playing this anymore at game nights/days/conventions, and though my anecdotal evidence may be too small a sample, I still suspect that many of you have cooled on this one (and won't admit it).

This game just doesn't gel for me. Ostensibly, it's good - with some difficult strategic decisions to make and fairly tight overall. But there is little or no tie in between the theme and the mechanisms or between the mechanisms themselves. I agree with what others have said: deep, but not very elegant. 

Good, but maybe too much work for the payoff. I've been told I need more plays but I don't like that argument. 

For resource management - I'd much rather play Goa or Puerto Rico.

November 2010 Update:  Caylus hasn't aged well.  Every time I go back to play it, it feels like a disconnected jumble of mechanics.  It's still a good game, but I feel like everything in it is done better by other games.

---

Comment from 2008: A very good game.  The main concerns I have are the length of the game, and the feeling that, aside from choosing a basic strategies, the tactical decisions the game forces on you are not as interesting as they could be.  There's certainly a lot of game here, and it's stays interesting to the end.

A serious game for serious gamers. For the rest of us, it's dry, with a zero fun factor.  Also has too many choices each turn for my taste, no "flow," requires too much calculation and has a draggy endgame. Blue buildings are hard to build and are generally ignored. May challenge Puerto Rico as "greatest game," but isn't nearly as playable or pleasant, IMHO.

I prefer the card game as it is more streamlined and less fiddly. This is a very good game but it feels like work and players are too quiet when playing because it requires all your concentration to push cubes around in the correct way to make victory points (or prestige points or what ever the heck they call them in euros nowadays).
It has very quick turns which I like but could suffer major AP from those prone to over analysis.

When can I start having fun. I have played this twice now and sat in near silence with the people around me. Where's the fun in that?

Revisited this one after a multi-year hiatus, after I fell in love with Agricola.  The only complaint I really have is downtime: downtime with players, and reverse-funnel decision expansion with turns getting slower as the game progresses.  You can play around that with 2-3 fast players, though, and it is possible to RIP through a 3P game with motivated players.  Overall, I can conclude that this one has stood the test of time for me.  Made me peek back at the iOS implementation, whose UI I still unfortunately hate.

We had just played Magna Carta last week, so I wasn't really looking forward to playing its big brother Caylus tonight. That's how things shook out, though, so I sat down to play.

And I had a great time. This second game, with only people who already knew how to play, was pretty much fantastic. Everyone had a different strategy, there was a little screwage and a lot of cursing. It was a really good hour and a half.

Now I'm really looking forward to playing Caylus again.

UPDATE: Dave is right; this game really gets an extra half-point when you call the provost "the fucker".

UPDATE: The novelty of calling the provost rude names has worn off, but Caylus is still pretty fun. Of the games I've played so far, I think I vastly prefer three-player to five, and non-boozy to boozy.

I really like Caylus, but nobody likes playing Caylus with me. The rulebook sucks, but that isn't a criticism of the core mechanics. I love the full-information nature of the game, and the elegant system for turn ordering and action selection/blocking. Pretty sure I'm still screwing the rules up somehow, since it seems like every time I play I discover something else I'm doing wrong. 

I fear that, as much as I like the game, the one thing it lacks is the opportunity for a newcomer to succeed. It's a game that rewards careful study, much like Chess, which I both admire and despise. Have to think this through a bit, but it's depressing my rating for the moment.

I like Caylus. The problem with Caylus is that it seems overly mathematical. I feel like I could solve this game if I spent time thinking about it in my free time, wrote the values down on a spreadsheet. By "solve" I mean come up with the optimal strategy based on opponents' optimal strategies, assuming the opponents are rational. This is a very math-analytic game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a solid strategy game that presents the players with several options and approaches to take.  On any given turn you never feel that there is a 'correct' answer that should be followed, but are usually presented with several viable options to debate.  While some consider the game complex, it is really the interaction of the numerous elements that is complex. The game play is surprisingly easy.  It is definitely a game that favors players who have played before and have learned the various buildings.  A solid game if you are in the mood to wrap your brain around something. [GTI: TPSD]

I've seen Caylus described as 'dry' many times, and maybe the components aren't overflowing with amazing color and artwork, sure, but despite all that...this seems to really hold up as a paragon of the worker placement genre. Lots of little considerations, playing on your own or other players' buildings, working to score in one of the Castle sections. I also really dig the movement of the Provost and Bailiff, and the rather elegant and simple flow of most actions taken. I'm late to the party on this, but there is no question why it was such a popular game, and you will find its DNA in many hundreds of Euros to follow.

I had been avoiding this from early on in my time at the 'new' gaming group I started attending at the beginning of 2008.
I realise I'll probably do better in a second game but getting thrashed in the first doesn't engender me to play again. Worker placement games seem to cause me difficulties.
2011-10? I played again, three player, and did do a lot better than I managed in the first game. I'm still not wanting to play more though.

After playing Caylus a couple of times I've really started enjoying it. It's best played with people of the same skill level. I've only played it once on 3 so I can't comment on how well it plays with more players then 2 players but it's good on 2. It's a simple yet very deep game where you can explore new strategies and learn to think ahead. It's quick to set up and pack away which is good. It can become a bit too complex once you really get the hang of it though. Depending on who you are playing against it can be a bit annoying and you might have to think long about the outcome of every round.

The only reason I'm not granting Caylus a ten is because it goes on for a tad too long.  Otherwise, this is a terrific game of managing your resources and weighing your options.  Although there are 7 phases in a turn, everything gels and there is a natural progression from one phase to the next.  I absolutely love the turn angst when deciding where to place my workers or which favor to choose.  Highly recommended.  

Update: Caylus has dropped 4 points.  My most recent play was much too long, and hoping that a game will end just so the repetition will cease is not a good sign.  Games with similar complexity usually have rules that inspire curiosity and excitement; explaining Caylus' rules just inspires a dull, glazed look.  I still think that some of the game's mechanics are spiffy, but it just plays too long, and this is coming from someone who thinks that three hours of Power Grid rocks!

I've played the online version a couple of times, and really enjoy it. If the face to face experience is similar, the rating would stay there.

UPDATE: I still enjoy it very much, but my wife hated it, and I doubt I can actually play it with anyone else. The "unfriendliness" of this game drops it's rating to an 8.

A little confusing at first, and a great many methods available with which to win, made my first experience a bit overwhelming and not as enjoyable as it could have been, but I expect to play this again with a little more confidence and understanding of what I should do to win.  A definite game to try at least once for all serious gamers.

Caylus's reputation as a true "gamer's game" is well deserved.  

It's kinda a mish-mash of popular euro game mechanics.  A bit of auction, a bit of role selection, variable turn order, multiple paths to victory...plenty to sink your teeth into.

Not a good game to bring out with people new to boardgames though.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Excelent game! a gem of a game, may take awhile to understand and to play the game, but the rules are very well written which helps. The theme and the length of the game may not be of everyone's liking though.

Things I don't like:

- very few special buildings are built (1 or 2) per player, sometimes none.
- in the beggining moving the provost is important, but near the end he's so far ahead that it becomes useless to move him (yes, even if you arrange the bailif to move just 1 space each turn during the whole game).
- you never build the road all the way 'till the end.
- the last buildings to be build near the end of the game will most likely never get to be used.

I was skeptical when I opened the box and glanced at the rules.  Playing the game made all the difference in the world.

The game flows very naturally.  All the information you need is printed on the board and tiles.  There is no language dependence so they could have printed it in Russian and it still would have been fully accessible.

The interaction between players is somewhat transparent, but it is clearly there.  Buying buildings and getting bonuses when other people use them is a genuis implementation.  While I did not feel a "squeeze" in resources in the game like I would expect with a resource management game, decisions were extraordinarily difficult to make.  I wanted to do everything, but I didn't want to allow my opponents to do the stuff I didn't take.

The game is quite enjoyable.  My only complaint is the play time, which honestly, I didn't notice go by, however if I am planning a game night, that is a large block of time to allocate.

I really enjoy this game and am impressed by the fact that all the action takes place on one board, unlike Agricola or Puerto Rico which have individual playing boards. I also like how building the buildings gives you some sort of in game bonuses or benefits beyond just points unlike Stone Age where your huts only count for points. The ios version is also very good.

RATING: 7.5
A great open information system game with multiple paths to victory (favor track, castle building, gold hording, upgrade building, cash-to-VP conversion). The game certainly is on the long side of the spectrum and has some potential for analysis paralysis. After some familiarization with the game however, decisions should become more obvious and rapid.  

I really enjoy the tension as players race to get to key areas of the board, either for resources, cash, favors, or VPs. This keeps all players constantly involved and immersed in the game. In addition, the game scales well from 2 to 5 in my opinion (certainly as well as PR). The 2 major knocks against the game are the longish playing time and the fairly static valuation of the different areas on the board which can make the game a bit repetitive. 

Dropped rating from 9 to 8 as it does run a little bit too long for my tastes.

Az egyik kedvencem ez a játék. A kisbírós mechanizmus egyfelől nagyon ötletes, a játék hossza ettől függően nagyon széles skálán mozoghat. (Ezzel viszont elveszik a lehetősége az egyes partik eredményének összehasonlíthatóságának.) Másfelől leginkább a kisbíró révén kerül konfliktus a játékba, érvényesülhet pl. a "dögöljön meg a szomszéd tehene is" effektus, de össze is foghatnak a játékosok egymás ellen. Nagyon durván nyersanyaghiányos játék. Talán egyszer éreztem eddig úgy, hogy nagyjából megépítettem, amit szerettem volna:)
Egyik partit úgy játszottuk, hogy nem volt ott az eredeti készlet és ezért, (mintha amúgy nem lenne elég nehéz) a Catan, a Wikinger, és a Puerto Rico fa anyagaiból raktuk össze a készletet, így a szabályokon kívül a színek átkódolását is meg kellett jegyezni:)

Szerencse szerepe nagyon kicsi!

Eszembe jutott egy plusz erénye: kis helyet foglal: van a tábla és pár lapka és pénz az asztalon, kb. ennyi. Nincs feleslegesen százezer jelző. Ugyanez a játékmechanizmusra is igaz, letisztult, egzakt. Kedvenc!

Good worker placement game that nevertheless has left me personally neutral. The rules take you one run to understand and about 10min to explain, which is definitely a plus. Mechanism-wise, there is no groundbreaking, breathtaking difference from all those other games of the same category out there. It must have been something in its time of initial publish, but..It would probably be a great game for a euro-game fan, but it felt somewhat too mechanism-focused and relatively dry for me that also enjoys at least a hint of a theme in my game.

I've played 100 times in three months, and written and thought far too much about this. Burnt out a bit, after so many plays (over 100), so I lowered my rating.

A superb game of building alongside some very wonderful management play.
You need to build a number of things in order to gain Victory Points. In order to build you must manage resources/money/workers all of which always seem to be tight ( but not scarce ) There are many different paths to Victory Points and limited options to impede other players. Its all about choices...choices ...choices...

This is THE very first worker placement game, and it is the first heavy eurogame I had the chance to enjoy. Since that first play, my own perception of the boardgaming world was turned upside down. The game experience is a pain with 5 players, enjoyable with 4, but it really shines with 3. And with 2 is a true masterpiece. It doesn't get played as often as it deserves because of its lenght, but Caylus is undoubtely one of my favorite games!

Initial Impression: This is a good worker placement game with an interesting mechanism involving claiming areas on a track in order to gain resources. The theme is weak but the gameplay can be a real brainburner. If given the option, I would choose to play Carson City, which uses a similar mechanism but adds area control and direct interaction to the mix.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My first game wasn't that exciting : There are a lot of possibilities but the game was becoming really interesting in the third part of the game, but then it was almost decided. Maybe we played too fast on the castle and too less on buildings. Maybe a next playing will revise my view. I had to admit that although this game became a classic and a trendsetter (workerplacement games) I am not a heavy fan of this game, because I never know what to do.

7 years later I played it again and still I struggle with my strategy, this time I had some more fun in playing the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
This game is brilliant. For a game with pretty concrete strategies, after 12 plays I still feel as though there is a lot of variety. Unlike other games, this one is truly a different game at different player counts. I don't think it is as meaningful as Ryan Sturm does, but it is a solid worker placement game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Classic game that still holds up. The simplicity, variety of decisions and, of course, the provost seem to be the keys to excellence. I do worry a bit that, despite the analysis you need to do to win (assuming players are equally skilled), the layered mechanisms obfuscate dominant strategies. However, the control the players get over the game's pacing and what resources end up being scarce alters the calculus enough for me to, for the most part, ignore that feeling. Still, I've yet to have a game where the winner didn't go up the influence royal favor track. 

The interactivity between the players and pace control keeps you entirely engaged. Further, you want to play again once you finish. Though, I do wish there was a way to cut 10-15 minutes from its playtime (most games are 90-120 minutes, though you can get it down closer to 60-75 with 2 players). This does feel unlike most other worker placement games I've played.

RATING: 7
Will I ever tire of winning the King's Favor?  I highly doubt it for not even Agricola has diminished my enthusiasm!   The order in which the buildings are built, the Provost movement, and the fight (or lack of a fight) for favors will probably keep this game from becoming stale anytime soon. So far no two sessions have played out the same, which is awesome since Caylus is a perfect information sort of game.  
  
The main downside to Caylus is the hard-to-follow rulebook, but Ystari games provides an easy-to-follow rules summary online.  The other downside to Caylus is that it doesn't scale as well as Agricola.  I love the control in a 2-player game.  I also love the player/provost interaction in a 3-4 player game.  Unfortunately, the 5-player game feels more tedious for your choices are rather limited.  With experienced players this game shouldn't take longer than 60-120 minutes.

I like Caylus.

I think Caylus is a great game for two or three players.  I find it too long for four or five.

Caylus borrows mechanics and ideas from a lot of other very good games and combined them to create a very good gaming experience.  For me, it feels a lot like Keythedral and given the choice I would rather play Keythedral with three or more and Caylus with two.

A worker placement game with much depth, probably more than Cuba, Leonardo da Vinci, and Pillars of the Earth. However the theme is not attractive to me, the art is inferior to these other games, and generally I would pick other worker placement games over this one. It most reminds me of Cuba because you are able to purchase a wide variety of buildings from the start. I do like it and would enjoy playing again.

Update: Purchased the special edition with art by Mike Doyle. Wow, this is probably the most attractive game I own.

LIKES - Strongly influenced development of other succeeding worker placement games.  Paying to place workers.  Bribing the baliff.  Outstanding strategic depth and decisions to be made.

DISLIKES - Only accessible to hardcore gamers.  

WHY A 6.5 BASED ON BGG DEFINITIONS - This is an excellently designed game (9), However, I would "sporadically" play this game because it is not appealing to the majority of non-gamer gamers.  It is going to be difficult to get this one to the table as a result, which is too bad because this is an inspired game.

The layers of strategy, timing, and backstabbing made our evening very enjoyable.  I can see why it is rated so high.  I can't wait to play again.

I don't like this game as much as most others do, due to the steep learning curve. In the first few games one has no idea what actions are optimal, and one is pretty much unable to rationally think it through.

Worthy of the hype. There are many paths to victory  and I do honestly enjoy myself whilst playing this game.

After one play, this gets a 7.5, although depending upon repeated plays I'm not sure which way the rating will go.  There's lots to like here, like the multiple victory paths, little downtime, and the low level of luck, but there's also quite a bit to dislike: long play time, and game-deciding king-making.  I enjoyed our first game, and it only took about 2 hours to play after the rule explanation.

3 Plays down and a definite upgrade from an 8 to a 9. Once the rules are fully understood and the importance of reading the need to develop the castle and key buildings, the scoring possibilities explode. A wonderfully wide and exquisitely balanced luck-free game.

I've played this with 3 players and with 5 players.  5 players made the game way too long and playing with 3 was...well, it left something to be desired.  Anyway, I'm wondering if 4 players is the sweet spot and looking forward to an opportunity to try it.

So, my rating of 7.5 will stay because I don't consider Caylus as an excellent game.  Good, but not excellent.

Maybe I am buying into the hype, and maybe this is just like Puerto Rico and I am not willing to admit it, but I have enjoyed the two games of this I have played.  I lost both games, but it was fun.  Now that I think about it, I don't know if I really want to play it again.  Weird.  Maybe I should drop this down to a 6 then... UPDATE: Dropped to a 4 cause I have NO interest at all in playing this ever again. Too long for what it is.

This is a classic game.  The various ways to get points make for lots of replayability and the provost is a fantastic mechanic to either try and rush the game or as a way to directly inconvenience other players.  Fantastic design (AND my wife loves it!)

I spend a lot of time researching before I buy a game (about half of games were given as gifts).  I have been interested by Caylus for some time and finally pulled the trigger on purchasing and I am glad that I did.  I was impressed with how well the theme fits with all of the actions taken in the game.  I had read that the mechanics were great but as in many Euros the theme was more or less pasted on.  

I have found that Caylus is the total package: it has incredibly interesting and meaningful decisions to make, there are multiple viable strategies, it is highly interactive (even when played with 2), and the presentation and theme add to the overall experience.

RATING: 8
Not sure what to say about this one that has not already been said elsewhere. Suffice to say I spent about 4 years or so knowing about this gem and hearing about it, reading about it, and avoiding it. Only because there were so many others I was enjoying I did not want to blast through the current heavyweights, I wanted to savor it. 

With all the hype of a good 2.75 years behind it, that first play with other newbs being taught by a seasoned vet between TWO tables, was what Board Gaming is all about to me: Superb, clever, funny, and just deep enough to have a table full of ADULT gamers on their toes. The simplistic elegance of playing the game well is fantastically hidden in a system and art that actually concedes a bigger scale than is really on tap. Nearly unspeakable was my own glee when I "got it" not the last at the table to grasp, but not the first either, was just right to me. 

Elegance deontes to me in a Board game one that can convey its theme and sense of purpose in spite of the bits and bobs in the box or on the table, and I am ever appreciative of those designers/Publishers who deliver on this. 

Caylus IS this to me, and will for a long time be that to me. 

That I do not own a copy is not nearly as telling as is the fact that I unwilling to own such a Gem when there is much to my collection as it stands that has yet to be played.

They would not see time at all!

RATING: 7
UPDATE: it is sinking rapidly on my list, and on not my list alone by the sound of it (8.5>7.5>7). It feels more and more like a progressive resource management game akin to Settlers on the PC, except that the fun-pyramid has been turned upside-down. A PC takes over the boring calculating-in-the-background-bit, to allow players to concentrate on all the action and excitement. Here I keep feeling like the computer making all the boring little programmed advancement steps, and I suspect it is [i]the game[/i] that is having all the fun. Throw the marble in at the top, watch it all click and tick, and observe how clever it comes out at the other end. But a good chef knows what ingredients to leave out to make it taste distinct. What we have here is a brainy mechanism soup with one or two too many bits thrown in that thorough playtesting should have thrown out.

I especially don't like the hoarding factor that allows a capable leader to bully players out of catching up moves through sheer castle wall + favour monopolies alone. It also has caught the worst aspect of chess, in that it only makes sense to play players of similar abilities. With the observation that at least with chess you only need one more to have a balanced game. The problem starts with the layout of the board. If the castle and favour track had been placed in the centre, it's importance would have been more intuitive. Now they have been squeezed into a fifth on the side. Downtime can take silly proportions, not helped by a game group that has some players who cannot get themselves to make a move if it isn't the best one. [i]Now if the next player placed there and .....[/i] Peculiarly, and leaving the time to get there aside, it seems to start to get interesting when it ends. Bored already and it is still a few turns short. Strange. I'm starting to suspect Caylus is the reason why someone invented the computer 40 years earlier. So there was no need for it. It takes too long without enough fun, to do too little.

I still think it can be a decent game for comparable players in the right mood with less to choose from, and I am sure some people have had memorable experiences, but I have completely gone off it.

OLD COMMENTS:
First play could be typified by turn-by-turn realizations along the lines of "make mental note not to do that ever again", "ah, that's how it works" and "I should have planned that better". Second one just under my belt and has been plain sailing. Played with one new player and we played one trial round before kicking off proper, wished that had been done for my virgin game as well.

p: This game is inevitably gonna suffer from the same problem I had with Puerto Rico. It has already been praised sky-high, so my initial impression will be measured against mythical expectations. Not fair, but hard to avoid. It probably means that small faults will bring it down a bit further on my scale than it maybe deserves. 

And indeed, like Puerto Rico, my initial response is favourable, but not THAT much. Don't get me wrong, I'll happily play this as it incorporates a lot of elements that get my juices flowing, but it also has elements that keep it well away from my perfect 10. Downtime being the main one. I have played many, many games that thrilled me as least as much on a first play. And it aren't always the flawless games that give me the greatest joy either. Furthermore, this one doesn't offer enough new elements to me to make it particularly stand out, even though it does integrate them very well indeed. Yup, it's high on my hill of great games too, but surely it's not the top ?!

In Settlers the PC game it can be frustrating to hang around with nothing to do until the sawmill has spit out the next plank for the next building for the next resource, but at least you can speed it up. Here you can only stack your resource cubes in new and interesting ways, until all other players have pondered in turn over the perfect information on the table. And whilst it is fantastic that there is quite a bit you can do with your dobbers, only a few are genuinely worth considering, meaning it can feel a bit "programmable".

It also doesn't have the sort of player interaction I like best, as apart from blocking players off their preferred locations, there is not a lot you can do to engage with them. No trading, no negotiating, and no way to mess around with people's hoards. Settlers improves a lot because of the threat of losing half your card resources, making it much more risky to produce powerful combo moves or hang back for that ideal option. Here, with acquired resources safely in the hand, people who carve out a slender lead probably also carve out the option to make more powerful follow-ups, whilst stragglers will keep struggling to acquire the right materials to catch up. Some people will love all that. I don't.

Also a bit worried to see players frequently make the same move combos, just in different phases. One player executes a tile combo with the next player in line preparing for the exact same combo in the next turn, whilst number three realises he's frozen out for now but is gonna make damn sure to sit in the preparation slots next turn. I hope it is more "what to do in what turn", rather than "what turn to do IT in".

On the plus side, I'm a big fan of games where people "bid" for turn order, and the cost of giving up a valuable action slot can be hefty and is a nice twist. I welcome the semi-random set-up and the way to speed up or slow down game progress. With an overdose of resources for development mechanisms on offer any big fans of a well done acoustic settler's pc game will have their pleasure points tickled. And Caylus is certainly challenging and full of great dilemmas. Using the same materials for so many mechanisms is done elegantly, but maybe I would enjoy it more if there was slightly less you could do by yourself. For the downside of so many options is that people will wait until their own turn before they start thinking, and for the 2+ hours you'll invest,  you don't get that many turns. I don't feel that the excitement during your turn is enough to forget the thumb twiddling between turns, even if it's suicide not to pay attention to your opponent's moves.

I am pleased that for once the general excitement of the (easy excitable) gaming community is blasting a small designers' outfit into the outer stratosphere. But that a relatively hard to get game has found itself centre stage says probably more about the output quality of the bigger companies. The lack of imposing titles from the usual suspects has meant that the "next new thing" gamers have been allowed to drift. Add to that the directional power of the wildfire buzz generated on places like BGG and the result? What, call yourself a gamer and you haven't played this yet? I'm sure you are  looking for a way to fill that "big empty void" as soon as you can.

There seems to be a tendency to quest for the ultimate game by some geeks over here, often with lengthy discussions about its perfections, something I will never understand. Maybe I do like gaming and games more than game titles. I have noticed that in our group too, there often seems to be an unwritten short-list of hot games to seek out, invisibly herding general opinion towards a handful of new releases. There was a small outcry when they discovered I had owned a copy of PR for two years without touching it. As if I was missing out on something. They should have seen my face when I opened my red Hilly Billy tube!

Relying on general opinion all adds up to top 100 lists of favourite albums dictated by people who on the whole probably couldn't name 100 albums between them. There is nothing wrong with that. Just don't take those lists too seriously. And if you really want to discover what is out there, it is often wiser to find the discerning voice. Seems I'll just have to accept that this will be the  Beatles' "White Album" for a while. And for that reason alone it no doubt will be remembered that way too.  A classic! But proclaimed by whom and compared to what?

Looking forward to additional plays and expect the rating will go up.

I don't want to give too many 10 ratings, but Caylus gets very close to being perfect euro game. Scales to all possible player amounts well (2-5), requires thinking and is not too easy. I think this is the best worker placement game I've played so far (compared to Pillars of Earth, Stone Age, Agricola and that one polish game which name I never remember), and I like worker placement as mechanic a lot, and even though I have almost 100 games under my belt and have only won ONCE.

Resource management game, where actions, money and goods are used to collect victory points.
Interesting is that actions give money and goods, money gives actions and sometime goods and VP too, while goods are needed to VP but also can be used to collect money. Difficult to assess a winning strategy.
A lot of replay value, as players will score part of their points to build houses that will score VP, and will give to everybody their benefit. How much a building is useful depends by the construction order and by which other buildings have been done.
No luck apart starting order that can be managed.
Meaty.

I don't believe this is as complicated to learn and play as people think it is. Winning is another matter entirely. I don't really like a game where the players don't bribe the provost enough. Maybe I should bribe the provost first and provoke my fellow players into counter bribing or revenge bribing. That might create the more defense oriented game of Caylus that I am seeking.

This game is fun but can be a bit lengthy and gets a repetitive feel if played with the same players. This is based off of 3 plays. I like the game and fear that it may play best with players who don't know each other but know the game. I haven't found away to win so this will keep me intrigued with playing the game.

11/13/07: Lowered my rating because the game feels redundant. I know this game has a lot of different ways to win, but they all feel the same. I'll only play 3 or 4 player and need to be in the mood. Age of Empires III is much better.

10/29/10: Raised rating simply because this is a good Euro. The player interaction is higher than most Euros and ,if you can get a few AT'ers to play, a lot more fun.

Caylus is a brilliant, tension filled brain burner that belongs in every Euro game collection. The king of worker placement games has some close rivals but I have yet to find better. Not the easiest to learn but ever so rewarding to play. This is an iconic strategy game that has no tolerance for  luck.  High replayability, great components, multiple paths to victory, and pure gaming awesomeness.

RATING: 8.6
This game can be likened to multi-player chess and provides relatively good player interaction for a euro. When the provost moves, it can get really emotional, especially if you are getting targeted by the rest. The artwork is mediocre.

I must admit, I was surprised by this game after having finally played it. I was so afraid it was not going to live up to all the hype, but wrong I was. This was the best 2-player, non-wargame, I've played. Can not wait to try it out with more. I think I may enjoy the 3-player game more; but that with 4, and especially 5, the game may not be so grand. However, I'm sure it will still be fun with any number.

I love this game but can never get it to the table. With five people, it takes way too long and I don't do that again. With two players, the bidding suffers, but the rest is really good. Three is probably the sweet spot.

This game is a phenomenal system. The continual trade-offs and min/maxing actually make an extraordinary gaming experience. I have always loved chess. Caylus is the closest board game with all the bonus of being a 'Euro'. What I also appreciate is the constant state of flux as players get involved. Every choice has a minus and a plus. If played properly, it is as pure gaming as you can get, all without player elimination!

Lots of paths to go down with this game.  Not a difficult game, in my view.  Game should move fairly quickly once a round or two (and the rules) are gone thru.  Enjoyed my playing of this!

7/19/06 - Played three times now...4 player, 3 player and 2 player.  Each time I've played it, it had dropped.  I'm certain this is the level it will be at for me.  I don't mind it, I will play it if asked to play it, but I won't go out of my way to teach it new to anyone.  Many other games that are more enjoyable that I would rather learn, teach and enjoy.  
6/4/07 - I would like to play this again.

10/4/10 - okay, I have played this now at least once a week for the past three weeks.  It's a strong 8 right now.  Two player games have been quite awesome and nothing seems to fill that void.  My last game of this took 1.5 hours with two.  Nice!

RATING: 5.5
If I were doing ratings as BGG would have me do (by my desire to play the game), I'd give this a two. As it is, I recognize how it distills worker placement games in an effective way, even if what it distills is everything I hate about worker placement games. Runaway leader problems, extremely scripted turns, and a play time far longer than the game justifies all make this an unplayable mess.

Caylus, despite any other pretenders, is the true successor of Puerto Rico.  The similarities are truly uncanny.  Like Puerto Rico, Caylus is on the whole more of a short-term optimization game than a long-range strategic one.  The mechanics also bear a striking similarity, if not in fact at least in feel.Most importantly and most unfortunately, both reach a certain threshhold of plays before it feels like a dessicated husk of the game you once loved.  Puerto Rico hit this barrier after a very respectable number of plays; Caylus did not manage the same dignity.  As I approached ten plays, the repetition and stagnancy of the worker placement phase drove towards tedium.  For all its pretensions of variability, Caylus never procures enough to significantly alter your paradigm within a game, let alone between them. So Caylus has dropped from its lofty perch and we shall see if it continues to fall.

Perhaps my favourite three player game? For a game with so little randomness (starting six tiles and turn order) I still find it amazing how I can destroy everyone at the table with 75 points then lose with 110 points. Oh boy does the stress build when you realize you just put three workers near the end of the track and that person across the table grins as they go on the move provost spot. I am way too greedy when I play this game. Holy crap I love little wooden cubes.

Oh ya. This game is just dripping with theme.

Can tend to be a bit more tatical than I prefer.  While fun to play, I feel that it might be too long of a game by a third. 

After a dozen or so plays I'm finding I like it less and less.  Think it may be that I'm not finding any cleverness to play.  There are no mechanisms that let you think "ooohh.. that was a cool play".

A few more plays and few a few more fractions off my rating.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
2 plays.  It's not the best thing since sliced bread so don't be fooled by the phenomenal rating... but it's a pretty good game.  Steep learning curve for newbies.  I tried to be the "builder of useful buildings" to earn lots of points, but that was difficult to do as a newbie.  Getting the free favors for building the most pieces of the castle seems important... much like making the best offering in Amun-Re to get the most bonus actions.

UPDATE 2014:
With 7 plays logged... The reason I dislike the game is the provost.  It annoys me to have to guess where the provost will end up and to have to hope (and/or ride coattails) to not get negatively impacted.  Early in the game there's some rather petty blocking of actions... actions that nobody will give a rat's pituty about just a few turns later... this really burns me for some reason.  It's a solid (and very strategic/calculating) game if you don't mind dry, set collection/cube-pushing games... and you can tolerate the damn provost.  My tolerance level increases if I play multiple times in a short period of time and the rules, mechanics and strategies are fresher in my mind... otherwise I just get heated and annoyed by people hitting me with the provost and snaking the favors.  Sarah likes b/c she feels there are many ways to win and you don't need to focus heavily on the favors.  I'm not sure, but I won recently by focusing on making buildings and making only the minimum 2 houses per castle area (and got only 5-6 favors for the entire game).

Jonathan68 on BGG says:
Since Caylus is 10 years old now and is one of the founding fathers of worker placement games, a lot of it’s mechanics aren’t unique. What keeps Caylus relevant and what makes it stand apart is the arrangement in which it uses those mechanics. Here are a few notable points: (1) Caylus has a balance of strategy and tactics not often seen in games these days. Like any game you have to adapt to what’s going on to maximize your points but you have a lot of freedom to approach the game in widely different ways. Rarely is there ever a strategy you can’t use because you were muscled out of the spaces and resources you need; there are multiple paths to victory and multiple ways to go about those paths. (2) Caylus gives more workers than most. The aforementioned point is partly because each player gets 6 workers and because there are a lot of spaces that provide the resources you need. This gives you a lot of options, especially as the game moves into the final rounds. (3) Caylus has a lot more player interaction than most Euros. The ever changing turn order, the race to resource spaces, the limited space in the castle sections, the influencing of the provost, even the lack of individual player boards, all create a very engaging experience with your opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a phenomenal game.  It's very fun to have to stay on your toes and keep shifting your strategies depending on other players' moves during the 'placing of workers' phase.  I also like how you can attempt to speed up the game or slow down the game depending on how well you're doing (how the bailiff moves), and in general, it's nice to get a sense of how long the game is going to take.  It's also nice to get a clear sense of how everyone is doing at all times...unlike Tigris and Euphrates, Settlers of Catan (with people hiding their VP cards), Puerto Rico (difficult to calculate how many points people have) and even Carcassone (since it's not so easy to read the farmland).

RATING: 6
I will say now that my rating is based on our first and only play so far, but based on that experience, my desire to play it again soon is low. There are a number of other things I would much, much rather play, though perhaps my rating would go up after more plays.

In short, we found the lack of money in the beginning far more frustrating than either fun or challenging. It feels like you have to claw your way out of a hole from the beginning, and one good screw on a turn (say, by the evil provost, a lack of money and a bad position in the turn order), can set you back two turns before you recover. Intricate, yes. Strategic depth, certainly. Painful, absolutely, excruciatingly so. In the end, I didn't feel so much like I'd had fun, more like I'd been put through a wringer washer a couple times - and I didn't finish in last place (of course, I didn't win, either). Will try again some other day and re-evaluate the rating!

See my notes of "Scepter of Zavandor" for a related thought about the evil starting conditions in these games.

Ouch! Played once and realise that there is a lot to this game and a lot I don't yet know. However, it's the kind of game I like, I'll want to play this again soon.

I've managed a second play of this now (months later!) and fared a lot better as I managed to hit on a strategy that worked for that particular game - building the castle and almost no buildings outside worked for me this time. There were no "luxury" buildings going to be built which helped me stick with the one strategy throughout. I finished in a 2-way tie for the win.

RATING: 9
I learned Caylus only after learning many other worker placement development games that were developed (obviously) by people who learned from Caylus.  All at once I could see why Caylus has had such an impact on the games to come after it.  There is just something really fun about trying to gauge the other player's intentions when you tempt the Provost.  There are subtleties in placing workers near the end of the road versus passing position for the round versus Castle donations versus building.  I can see that the direct conflict in this game could become tense with an unfriendly crowd, so I'll probably be careful about who I play this game with.

On it's way to me via my first math trade.

Well, it arrived and I really enjoyed the first game.  Very deep and so many factors to consider, I'm really hoping to play more of this soon!

Caylus really grabbed ahold of me.  I've barely scratched the surface of this title, but I'd love to get more plays in soon.  My biggest problem is finding more than one other person that loves heavy Euros like this.  Most of my group is not interested in this game.

Due to lack of interest from my group, and heavy euros (like Le Havre and Agricola) in my collection Caylus was sold and made space in my collection for other games.

The only problem is that the game can slow down by AP, just make sure to play it with the right people.

I do not understand why this game got so good ratings. I have played it a few times and I think it's really boring. Between every turn you have to re-think your moves and it just takes too long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Good game - with 5 problems:

1. Game Length, it runs a little longer than I'd like, probably because you have perfect information so analysis paralysis can set in. If you have anyone in your game group with this afliction avoid this game or settle down for a long wait between turns! With slow players you might want to avoid playing with 5

2. Graphics - the icons on the tiles are pretty small, especially the building costs and the colours aren't that distinct, causing some players problems
 
3. Money - ugh, horrible plastic disks, and they give you 5's and 1's but most of the time you never need 5's - and the mix is off, more 1's are needed. [fixed with the 2nd printing, but doesn't help me ...]

4. 3 Player - this seems to suffer like many games in that it isn't so great with 3. With 3 if one of your opponents starts competing with you for something (buildings, type of cube, favors, castle building etc) then the player who's doing something else will probably win. Yes you can try to switch strategy mid-game but it's not ideal. Not such a problem with 4,5 and non-existant with 2.

5. Gets rather repetitive - each turn is similar and given the length it can drag a bit, especially if your group has any players who suffer AP :( More I play it the less I like it.

But negatives aside, there's lots of decisions to make and various strategies to follow, and you have to plan for the next turn in the current turn (money needed, cubes needed etc). Not at the stage where it would hit the trade pile 

** update, now played the card game version - much prefer that, and now Caylus is traded for the card game version. Doubt I'll ever play it again.

*** Update, played again, wasn't that great, I can see why others like it, but I don't find it very enjoyable, I just wanted the game to end (not a good sign), dropped my rating, doubt I'll play this again (but I said that last time!)

An interesting challenge with the novel baliff/Provost idea, and some nice manouvering around the Pub and bridge. Not as gripping with its theme as some other building games for some reason.

There can be some scripted moves and actions in the beginning. Also if you play with inexperienced player the game tends to be very unforgiving. One mistake and you will have serious problem to win the game. Rating lowered.
--- Update 2 ---
When the initial gloss have gone away and you start to see the way the game works it is quite boring. I usually can spot the winner in 4-player games in the middle of the game. The only way to stop the runaway leader is if he does some mistake.
Also not very fun to play if people have different level of knowledge of the tactics in the game. Rating lowered.

Caylus is a really fun worker placement game where there are multiple paths to victory. Specialization is rewarded and if you fail to corner a market, you will fall behind. It has lots of player interaction and plenty of chances to be as nice or as mean as you'd like. Great game!

Reminds me a bit of Goa, in that you determine your actions each turn by claiming tiles, but the options seemed to be much more open in Caylus.  UPDATE:  Rated this a 9 after one play, then changed the rating from 9 to 9.5 after another play (4 players, 1 hour 45 minutes).  Had a blast even though I came in dead last!  After 10-12 plays, rating upped to 9.75 -- each game plays out quite differently, even with the same group.

1289. Pour consolider les frontieres du royaume de France, le roi Philippe Le Bel a décidé de faire construire un nouveau chateau. Pour l'instant, Caylus n'est qu'un modeste bourg mais, bientot, les ouvriers et les artisans affluent par dizaines, attirés par la fortune que peut leur apporter ce formidable ouvrage. Autour de ce chantier, une ville commence lentement à émerger

El mejor eurogame que he jugado. Escala perfectamente hasta los 5 jugadores, haciendo que sea un juego excepcional con 2 y 3 jugadores, y tiene una pequeña presencia de "puteo" que hace que o genere una sensación de "solitario multijugador".

Exige, eso sí, máxima concentración. Hasta que no queme este juego no me planteo comprar otro euro "pesado". Edito: mentira podrida. Me compré despues Power Grid y Carson City. Asco de consumo.

Duración entre 90 y 120 minutos

RATING: 6
The game's OK, and there are certainly a variety of different strategic options, etc. but after a couple of plays it doesn't feel like the strategic event horizon that it seemed to have a couple of moves into my first game is really an illusion--the random tile set up and impact of where buildings get placed on the track certainly has a huge impact on the game, but there's an aweful lot of bean-counting for each true strategic decision.  I'm especially disappointed by having to pay 1 to place each worker since this creates a huge overhead of moving individual coin chips back and forwards, probably doubling the length of the game.

OK, believe the hype.  This game is very, very good.  I'd give it a better grade if I weren't so utterly duff at these economic games.  Every aspect of the rules is entirely interdependent with every other aspect.  The choices are agonising at every turn.  A masterpiece.  The only flaw, as far as I'm concerned, is that the components, while very good quality, just aren't quite as good as you want them to be.  The colours aren't distinctive enough, particularly for the goods, and the coins are a bit dull (and there aren't quite enough 1d coins); they'll get replaced by pfennigs and marks by the next time we play.

In my first game, I was clueless and did not have much fun. However, I could not resist to buy the Special Edition and I have not regretted it for a minute. This game is truly a masterpiece for 2 or 3 players. With more, you cannot really make any plans.

Lots of depth with a multitude of strategies and paths to victory.

Games can play somewhat differently depending on when/which buildings are built. Very good replayability. Scales well to 2 and 3 players.

Update Aug 2012. Dropped from 9 to 7.  Revisited after a few years and Caylus feels broken. After some 14 games, the winner is known about a third of the way through. Whoever gets 2 of the 3 triple-productions always wins. I haven't seen otherwise. Caylus was novel in its day and was a first in many ways. But now it's just another worker placement. And one that doesn't feel balanced.

3/29/06 - finally got a copy of this game but it was worth the wait because it comes with the cardboard money and surprise..surprise it also contained the jewelers tile. Yippee!! I have played this game a few times already but I'm still not sure what the best strategy is even though I have won a few times. At the moment, I think a mix of castle building and building..er..uhm buildings seems to, at least, get you a fair amount of victory points. 5 player games are very tough because you are inevitably fighting for first place in the turn order. So overall, a great game..no two games are alike..which scores big for me and the board apart from the fixed buildings has a different feel to it every game.

A bland, dry, themeless game with a crushingly cruel blocking mechanic. The mechanics are all very good, and the game pits players against each other in tense, tight matches, so I can't say this is a bad game, but it's just too cold and mean for my taste. I would so much rather play the dozens of other worker placement Euros that are much more fun and pleasant rather than play this sullen older brother of theirs.

I must admit to some surprise that Caylus has both gotten so much acclaim and held its appeal for so long; we'll see if things hold up after the second printing. The game is neat in spots, and has interesting stuff, but at the end of the day it's klunky, inelegant, highly derivitive, poorly-themed, unevenly paced, excessively-analytical, and much too long. Caylus is a classic eurogame in that it's all about taking some resources and turning them into other resources or using them to compete for victory points in some way. Some of the techniques with which they've done this are clever. But the good eurogames take these basic ideas and give them some spark of artistic creation, an idea that breathes life into it somehow: either a well-done theme, as in Settlers; the excitement of Beowulf; or a clever central driver, like Puerto Rico; or something like that. Or it's a design which is in and of itself elegant and artistic, like a Through the Desert. Caylus has no spark. It's entirely mechanical and processional, constrained and technical, without life - which would be much more forgivable were the game not of ungodly length, 3  hours with 5 players if players take any time to think about their moves at all.

This is the core complaint about Caylus, I think, but there is more: there is brutal and completely unnecessary kingmaking with the Provost and some buildings. There are way-too-fiddly mechanical details, like the costs to operate buildings. The Royal Favors are unbalanced. Many buildings are unbalanced. The game lacks variability, tension, or excitement.

I've had differences of opinion with the BGG raters on a number of games: Bang! I thought was hideous, Carcassonne is overrated, Puerto Rico is a fine game but far from #1, and Scrabble and Beowulf are both criminally under-rated. But many of those I could easily ascribe to taste, with my idea of what makes a good game being different from most people's. This is the first game for which I think the raters here are delusional. Caylus is, at best, a second-tier game. Mechanically interesting, it still manages to lack almost everything that a good game should have.

Updated 6/7/10.  (Rating based on one 2-player game.)

Oh how I wanted to like Caylus. I finally got to play it, after what feels like months of trying, but, sadly, the game was a bit disappointing. I’ll admit at the outset that I’ve been slightly biased against the game because of the dry theme, drab artwork, and sub-par components (and, indeed, many of the houses and workers were significantly deformed). I’ll also admit that I was thoroughly destroyed in my first game, which likely left a bitter taste in my mouth. But, alas, I think my problems with Caylus run a bit deeper. 

My biggest critique was that the game was simply “all work and no play.” The game was sufficiently abstracted that collecting and spending cubes of various colors lacked any sense of meaning to me.  The issue isn't so much a lack of theme for its own sake (I have no doubt that the game contains plenty of subtle thematic chrome), but rather the importance of theme in providing contextual gameplay cues.  Caylus lacked those contextual clues for me.  Maybe I build Random Building X and put my blue house on it. I don't really have a sense of what that means. Was it a good move? What do I do with it now? Will people use it other than me? Do I want them to? Did I just flood the game with pink cubes? Should I try to eliminate other sources of pink cubes? Is that even an efficient strategy? Or should I just take the pink cubes and go build the castle? Do I want to build the castle? It gets me some VP. But so would building another Random Building. But that one produces blue cubes... I ended up getting lost in a sea of seemingly unrelated information each turn because I couldn't intuit a strategy without a stronger sense of thematic integration.

Not surprisingly, much of our gameplay time was simply spent staring intently at the board, counting, recounting, processing, and then recounting again; this may be the single-most paralyzing game that I’ve played. Indeed, the experience didn’t feel so much like gaming, as it felt like we were both trying to reverse-engineer the spreadsheet that (hypothetically) the designer used to balance the game. 

In addition, the game allows for significant interference with other players: spending money to block their actions, occupying buildings they want, building buildings before they do, and out-building them at the castle to snatch a royal favor from under my their nose. The resulting dynamic, combining luckless play, deep and challenging strategy, and intentional interference with your opponent, makes the game feel a bit like a chess match. I hate chess. In our game, there was a moment halfway through the game where it was obvious that I had lost, badly. Not only was it simply demoralizing for future rounds (the game lacks any sort of catch-up mechanic), but it’s hard not to internalize such losses as a sort of personal failing when the game is perfect information. In short, Caylus is a gamer’s game that makes me feel inadequate as a gamer.

For a similar experience that is much more thematic and more satisfying, I recommend Le Havre.

Great game, with more interaction than most of the "big games" that I played so far (not that many actually). 
A very good cut throat aspect with the prevot and the "getting the favor at the castle" phases. 

Does not take that much time (at least with 2 or 3 players). Play very well with 2. 

Ask for both tactic and strategy.

Strategy is hard to get at the begining though... Need more plays.

The more I play the more I like.

No randomness, but every games are so different

RATING: 7
The original worker placement that stood the test of time and is still going strong today. In typical Euro fashion, players must gather resources, and construct buildings to score victory points. Money is very tight in this game having to pay for each worker you place leads to very difficult decisions. I also really enjoyed the favors for a bit of customization between players. Ultimately, the game is a bit too mean for my taste as you can really screw over some players by moving the prefect. The game also needs some variability because after a while I think players could figure out optimal moves. A good game with a bite that is best played only occasionally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Certainly the many possibilities in this game are intriguing. The game has a strategic depth that few other Euros offer. I can see why it is threatening to unseat the king of resource management games - Puerto Rico. I'd personally probably choose Caylus over PR if in a true game environment and equipped with sufficient time.

Much as say the university in PR, some parts of Caylus may not be too well balanced. The goods favour track is inferior to the other choices, I should say.

Thematically, I feel the game leaves me wanting. For this sort of complexity, I don't think the theme is conveyed in a sufficiently immersive manner. I'm thinking far more in a resources and assets mode than getting the castle-building vibes. In the Shadow of the Emperor or even El Grande strike me as thematically more immersive.

Good game, for sure. Great game? Well, if I were an American (who do seem to use the term in an inflationary manner) I'd probably agree. But as I'm not, I'd probably point to the game not posessing quite the excitement I wish for. It's simply a more calculational game - in that regard not unsimilar to Goa and Princes of Florence - neither being games I'm terribly fond of.

This game is The Game for me. As soon as I finish a game I want to play again. Haven't had a game give me that effect for a while. It's got building aspects, resource management, money management, a little screwage factor and penalties for not helping build the Castle. Very clever mechanics in the middle making a great game. 21 Plays

BIGGEST DRAWBACK: Mechanics are not very thematic (or reasonable). Why do you get a coin for placing a worker on the bridge? Why does the price for the other players increase then? Don't get me wrong: the mechanics work fine for the game, but I find it hard to understand them in context of the theme. I just don't feel like a medieval castle builder. But medieval themes are cool anyway...

While the power levels of the buildings increase over time, the game feels very samey to me throughout. 

I do love, however, some of the aspects of this game. Like the ability to speed up or slow down the end game (although I wish it didn't come at the price of slowing down the game overall as it discourages the use of the most powerful building each turn). Or how using other people's buildings gives them points. Or how favours can give you a specific overall plan for how to win.

Not bad, makes a good first "heavier" Euro as it manages to stay pretty engaging right 'til the end (which, even so, probably doesn't come as soon as I would like). This might be the game to make me fall in love with turn angst. It's pretty dry though.

Update: I played and enjoyed a bunch of this on BSW back in the day, but one day I just stopped and haven't really gone back since. My enjoyment while playing is probably around a BGG 7, but my lack of interest in pulling it out necessitates a drop. It's not something I'd be super against playing... but I guess in the end it really was a little too dry for the long haul.

After about 12 plays, the gameplay of this one is still really good.  A brain-burner with very little downtime.  Choices are agonizing.  Long term strategies are aplenty.  I think my only major gripe is the lack of strategic control from table randomness that makes this game a little too tactical for my tastes.  Like Puerto Rico, somebody doing something you weren't expecting can totally take you out of your element and advantage others at the table.  You can't easily predict the moves of other players.  It breaks the game down into little tactical movements with long term strategy, instead of shorter term strategies that give players that sense of accomplishment after a beautiful tactical play.  This gripe is little, a chink in the armor of an otherwise great game.

9 - Very well done game.  I really enjoy the mechanics and the depth.  There is absolutely no luck involved, which makes it a very deep game.  Not only that, but it is quite heavy because of all of the rules and details to remember.  Definitely a gamer's game, but the best that I've played so far.  My only complaints of this game are that it is not a very attractive game.  In fact, the wooden blocks and dull board make it a rather boring game to watch.  My other complaint is finding the right crowd to play with.  Because it is a gamer's game, it is relatively hard to find people to play this with.  There are no problems finding players online, which is fine if you enjoy competition at almost a chess tournament like level.

[u]October 2008:[/u] I have loved this game very very much, however I might have overplayed it a bit this year.

[u]May 2009:[/u] Ok, to be more specific: I've loved the game from the beginning, it is very challenging, the theme is stretched thin, true, but as for the mental challenge, it's one of the toughest game there is for a 2hr time. I can understand people who believe the game is soulless and it is true that I play this almost as if I were playing an abstract. However, as far as management goes, this game is great and second only to Antiquity (though Antiquity is painfully fiddly, so much I got rid of it). I'm still playing from time to time and since I'm always playing with my gf who has started long after I did, I'm experimenting and discovering tons of viable strategic routes. It is easy to think this game is solved, however, if you just have the guts to try something different, you'll realize there is a lot more to it.

RATING: 8.5
First of all a big "thank you" to Caylus for being one of the inspirations for Agricola, my favorite game! The two games share a similar worker placement mechanic, but other than that they are very different.

Caylus is an old worker placement game, probably one of the very first of its kind, but it still holds up!

The "snake pattern" is awesome as you need to think about in which order you get the resources - oh how many times I've been witness to somebody who went for the king's favor without having cloth, or wanted to build a building before they got the stone etc...

I also like the fact that you only have a handful or workers or so which means that you need to think carefully about where to place them - and in most WP games you can place all of your workers, but in this one you cannot if you don't have enough money! So you also need to juggle your income. The passing mechanism is great as well as it makes it much more expensive for the remaining players to place their workers, so the rounds usually end quickly once one or two players have passed.

The favors are a good idea as they are ways of specializing, and it doesn't seem like any of the favor tracks are better than others. The race for delivering batches makes the game even more tense!

Finally, the provost (and the bailiff) is what really makes the game intense! You cannot just jump ahead and get the benefit of the newly built and better buildings as your opponents can move the provost behind - which means that the buildings ahead won't get activated and you have lost those actions! That can be devastating, so you better be careful...

I like Caylus better with fewer rather than many players as you have much more control of what is happening, and due to Caylus being quite a heavy and thinky game AP is much worse with 4 and 5 players.

RATING: 10
An excellent game.  This game can get rather complicated, but once the game play becomes consistent, there are patterns that develop over time.  

Do not become overly frustrated with the rulebook.  Yes, it is poorly written and difficult to grasp at times.  That should not deter you from attempting the game - it is that good of a game.  Try as best as you can to wade through the rulebook and play a game with at least one other person who is familiar with the rules and can walk you through it.  It becomes intuitive after one or two rounds.

Strategy, on the other hand, is not as intuitive.  Luckily, the seating position does not have a detrimental impact on the game like PR does.  It will take you a few games to develop a winning strategy, but the gameplay experiences of playing while developing that strategy makes this game a winner.

Overal, an excellent game, and definitely something I would play again.

Over time this game has stood out as a great design.  Many games since have stolen one or more parts but the original stands out.

Things I don't like about Caylus: 1) The stupid plastic coins that are hard to pick up.

Beautiful board and the "real" deniers are amazing! I have a love/hate relationship with the Provost. He is the "screw you factor" of this game and can really mess up your well laid plans. Has a little bit of a learning curve for new player (don't all new games?) but all-in-all I really enjoy playing this one.

Best with 3 (Don't even want to try with 5!)

Rated "7" after one play. By the time I played this "modern classic," I already had at least six other worker placement games under my belt. Surprisingly, there's still a bit about Caylus that I enjoyed. I like how you have to pay to place workers. And, the moving provost (or baliff? Or something?) offers a nice "screw you" factor that leads to some tense decisions. I also totally dig how the early sections of the road become obsolete, with new buildings cropping up later on. And, mooching VPs when others use your hard earned spot is also nice.

At the same time, the theme is thin. Given the choice, I'd still choose Carson City or Age of Empires III for that worker placement style. The first two offer far better theme, and all three offer a greater degree of interaction, whether it's fighting for plots of land in the west, or regions in the New World, or factions in ancient Rome. Still, I admire what Caylus essentially got started. These worker placement games are the "bees knees."

I finally, finally got to play this after missing several games of it that filled up before I made it to games night.  I definitely enjoyed it.  PR, Power Grid, and Wallenstein are still higher on my list for games of more or less similar length and weight, and I think Caylus has been massively over-hyped, but it's a solid game in my book (even though I lost badly in that first game).

First play and yeah I can see what all the hype is about. Placing the workers gives you 20-30 different options each turn, way more than I've seen in other games. You need to work out what you want to do each turn and work out the order to do things in because other players want to do the same things and will block you. I definately see the similarity to Keythedral. Our 5 player game took 2 hours. Three of my opponents had played before and destroyed us beginners. Interestingly they were all playing quite different strategies.

RATING: 9
Like Puerto Rico, this is a brilliant machine.  It's intensely tactical: you have an endless number of chances to make tiny mistakes in execution that will leave you one denier, one cube or one worker short at the critical moment.  As a result you have to hold a fairly large plan in your head and keep adjusting it as other players place their workers.  Only played with 2 and 3 players so far, and it seems like the building favor track is strictly stronger than the others.  Rating might go down if this continues to be the case, as that's a fairly serious flaw.  (It's been suggested to me that the building track is less strong with more players.)

Enjoyable and tense game of "castle building".  Right out of the gate I played this about five times, but it has since waned somewhat.  I do like that it scales fairly well for two, which will help keep it out of the lower rankings, in all likelihood, since my wife also enjoys it.  Still, for a multi-player, it is currently sitting behind some other games that my group is more fond of.  But, I still think it's a solid game and I'm positive I'll play it some more.

Caylus is a staple game of my collection.  The first reason why, it is my wife's favorite game.  She judges all games I can get her to play to Caylus.  "Well it isn't is good as Caylus, or this seems similar to Caylus..."  I feel the hatred that Caylus can garner here on the Geek is a bit unjustified.  The provost can create some angst, I know I've experienced it once or twice.. :)  but what an awesome mechanic, a nice Euro with some major wronk factor! The second reason... it is pretty big hit with the gaming group.  Long live Caylus!

:sugar: :( :) :D :D :)

UPDATE 5/15: This got traded away a while ago (it just didn't get played -- mine is not a WP-heavy group, and I when I do get the urge for WP I, as I mentioned, tend to reach for Le Havre or Agricola, so Jones Theory and all that) but I keep pounding away at the iOS version of the game and it really is quite a treat of a game -- smart, interesting, and rich with possibilities without provoking sensory overload. This game is a bit of a slow burn -- it feels very samey when you first get into it -- but with further exploration you begin to see the possibilities inherent in different arrangements of buildings on the road and different ways to use the Provost to suck money from your fellow players' coffers, etc.

I do suspect that a game among people who have all mastered their strategy will come down to a simple question of execution, but there's a lot of climbing to do before you summit. If you can't figure out why you would ever put a meeple on the gate, you're still a beginner.

--

Scratches a pretty specific itch -- Caylus is worker placement made pure, with no extrinsic luck elements (apart from the placement of the six starting buildings and inital player order) or hidden information to get in the way of the raw test of skill. All the other heavy WP games I've played (Agricola more than Dominant Species more than Le Havre) have at least a little bit of luck or incomplete information. The game takes advantage of one of my favorite mechanics, wherein the players organically expand the scope of possible actions available not only to them but to others by building new buildings. (Compare Brass and Le Havre, which do the same thing.)  And the game is a true test; a brain burner with a lot of things going on, and working out a clever plan gives the player that warm fuzzy sense of satisfaction that good Euro games give you. 

That's the good news.

The bad news is the unintuitive rules, the paper-thin theme, and the easily-forgotten maintenance players must do to keep the game going. I played this on iOS devices before I played it in the flesh, and I was more sold on the game in computer form, since the computer did all of the busywork for me. This is a good and important game, and a landmark of game design. But if I want a worker placement game, my inclination is to reach for Le Havre or Agricola before this one, at least most of the time.

OK, two things.

A.  This is a really terrific game. Full of nastiness, it's really about being the toughest bully on the block, beating down your opponents. A very destructive game but a very solid one too.
B.  The theme is unacceptably lame.

What needs to happen is somebody needs to retheme this baby to something with a little more razzle-dazzle.  I think I'm the one to do it.

Players in "American Idol: The Journey" represent one of five celebrities from the hit FOX game show.  Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, Clay Aiken, Fantasia Barrino, and Carrie Underwood have all won the grand prize, but where do they go from here?  We'll track their progress over the course of three years, each ending in the Grammy Awards.  Whoever has sold the most records by the end of the third awards ceremony is the winner!

Our stars have to balance their efforts between recording singles ('craft buildings') and doing PR events ('castle building').  Either activity sells records, but Clay's going to need to balance his efforts.  If anybody completely ignores the PR effort, not only will he be forgotten come Grammy time, but they will actually LOSE reccord sales!

These tarts have some nasty tricks up their sleeve, and aren't afraid to pay to have nasty rumors published in Page Six, Defamer, Gawker, and the like.  This underhanded behavior is abstracted easily and effortlessly ('provost') and can potentially ruin a girl's entire plans for the next month or so.

Toward the third year, our stars begin to run out of ideas.  Often, to keep themselves in the running they will expend massive amounts of Street Cred ('gold cubes') to put out a Remix Record ('prestige building').  The Cred is worth a lot if you can hold onto it, but sometimes it's best to just cash in, especially if Kelly Clarkson is angling to do the same!

One single worth mentioning is the megahit "Since U Been Gone" ('Church').  Sure, Kelly recorded it in real life, but this game lets anybody release this hot single.  When this track drops, the artist responsible can immediately get tons of cash, sell even MORE records, get a great review on Pitchfork ('street cred,' or 'resource track'), or immediately drop ANOTHER single which is also guaranteed to hit the top of the charts.

THAT game would sell to Americans.  It's not that nobody is interested in or capable of playing good games, it's that I am too embarassed to tell half my friends that I enjoy activities where I pretend I'm a fucking 'master builder' in the days of King Philip the Fair.  Idol worship might not be that much better, but it's a step in the right direction.

-------------

About BSW.  This game is fantastic there.  In larger games you lose the ability to quickly make provost deals with other players, which is unfortunate.  However, if you play with groups where personal politics play an unfortunate role ("I don't want to screw him over this early, he'll have a vendetta against me for the rest of the game!"), the mostly-silent BSW environment basically negates this aspect.  I haven't played enough multiplayer on BSW to tell how adversely this affects play among mid-level players (experts won't need table-talk and novice decisions are arbitrary enough that it shouldn't matter either way), but I'll keep my eye out.

Two player is another story.  My preferred opponent and I have played this a few dozen times on BSW and we're down to about thirty minutes.

Caylus really provides two games in one box: the 2-player and multiplayer game.  Both are exquisite.  The game scales very well from 3-5, although either your tolerance for multiplayer chaos or your group's willingness to collude and negotiate needs to go way up for each player you add over 3.

Unfortunately it's not American Idol-themed, but it's the best we've got right now.  Anyone interested in low-to-no-luck games that hold up well to lengthy analysis should look seriously at Caylus.

This is my favorite of the heavier Euros.  There is lots of things going on and always leaves you with a sense that there is too much to do with too little resources.  The interplay between all of the mechanics is finely balanced.  Though I haven't played it many times, the games have been varied enough that I continually want to play more.

I am holding back on a full 10 because I have only played this with 2 players and a few 4 player games.  I haven't fully explored the 3-player or 5-player options which I hear can radically change the game play.

This is perhaps my favorite 2-player strategy game. I see it as being a shining example of truely excellent game design with the one exception of the stone building resource "kickbacks" being a bit too powerful. In a two player game, if one player has two of those types of stone buildings versus the other player having one, then those extra few cubes in "kickbacks" can make a huge difference.

Really great worker placement game, absolutely no luck involved. I used to like Lord of Waterdeep until I played this and completely lost interest in the former (haven't tried the expansion though).

An excellent economy, resource management, logistics game. Less thematic than Power Grid or Puerto Rico, unfortunately. Replay value seems to be very high. Not much fun as a two-player game, though.

RATING: 7
Caylus certainly feels like it borrows mechanics from several different games, but it all fits together very well. The game was pleasantly easy to get started playing, too, so the complexity is not in the rules so much as in the menu of decisions you are evaluating. 

Caylus belongs in the same company with Princes of Florence and Puerto Rico. I fully expect to see deeply thought out strategy articles, particularly now that it will be on BSW as well. After my introduction, I found myself thinking of different things I'd like to try in future playings.

I'm not convinced that the starting positions are necessarily balanced by the differential starting money, but the game is long enough that this disparity seems to fade into irrelevance. 

I think my rating could go up or down with more playings. One thing is for sure, I really want there to be more playings.

RATING: 7
Caylus has a lot of familiar mechanisms from previous games but combines them in a very fresh way. A zero luck, heavier medium weight Euro that features the special buildings of Puerto Rico and the resource gathering and competition of Keythedral and then adds in yet another thing to invest in in the form of an area influence contest at the castle which hands out one time bonuses. The core of Caylus is extremely tactical worker placement which is a straight pull from Keythedral, but it ends up being slightly more interesting because there is more than just goods cubes up for grabs, and the goods cubes themselves can generate VPs in more than one way. I will say, right here though, that this game has started to descend in my personal ratings. I was a very solid 9 for quite some time, but then it was down to an 8, and now it is at 7 because I think Agricola does the things I like here in a more enjoyable and variable way.

To me, the biggest strength of Caylus at first blush was the variability of play due to the way buildings are placed on the board. The initial seeding of buildings stays the same, but the order in which players voluntarily build changes the complexion of the game considerably from outing to outing. Games that are gold rich are considerably different from ones that are cloth rich, and so on. Lately though, I think I've started to not feel that way as much. Certainly, what you can do in a game that is gold poor is different, but it doesn't really feel all that different to me anymore. Unlike Puerto Rico's buildings, the ones in Caylus really don't seem to severely augment the game state that much because in Caylus, the various types of cubes really aren't all that important because you can probably find something useful to do with any of them. What this means, tactically speaking, is that grabbing cloth or spam isn't a hard choice because in many cases, it doesn't matter that much at all. If you're planning on building something out of stone be sure to have stone. By the late game be sure to grab some gold and a lot of one or another thing, but tactically, which is the level that this game operates on almost full time, your priority through most of the game should just be to hoard stuff, and to blow at least some of it on the king's favour track so that you can get the bonus favours and the victory points from the work. I think the game has been hurt somewhat in the long run as well by my disillusionment with the buildings you can put up...I used to actually ponder one over another, but at this point it seems clear there are two things that really matter: 1) the victory points you get immediately. 2) If it comes with a favour (because these generally let you build more buildings (if you're on the building track at least, and you probably should be if you want to win) which will net you even more victory points. Oh, and in the case of the blues, 3) Whether or not it generates income for you. Upon discovering this, my opnion of Caylus took a bit of a dip, because the game suddenly felt much more limited than it did previously.

That's the bad, so why does this game still get an 7? The bottom line is that this is still a resource gathering, neighbour screwing good time in the tradition of Keythedral but with more gamey stuff added onto it. There are a lot of interesting minor tactical decisons on when and where to place dudes, how much to bribe (and when), and how to go about accomplishing certain things. It definitely doesn't stand out at the level of a Puerto Rico in terms of variability, or at a Princes of Florence, in terms of agonizingly tough choices, but it does have some variability, and it does manage to cram some tough choices in, and the overall package is definitely fun.

I've played it at all scales now, and IMO it works very well with all of them, though, for the purposes of having slightly more control and a slightly faster game I prefer to cap games at 4 players. The 2 player version of it even seems to work very well, and while it doesn't have the new nuances that a Goa 2 player brings to the table, or a Zepter, it does at least manage to give one the flavour of the bigger game with only 2 at the table, and there is still some fierce competition over certain spots on the board, which is the entire crux of that portion of the game. 

It must be stated that I really prefer to play this with experienced hands who play quickly at this point though...I have played 4 handed games of Caylus that clock in at under 2 hours and 3 player games that are right around 60 minutes and to me, that 60-90 minutes is exactly where this game wants to be. I will generally avoid playing this game with people prone to AP, because it just does not stand up well to slower play for me anymore.

On a final aside, I feel that Agricola does almost everything I like about Caylus more effectively, and with more variability. The only plus here is that there aren't personally random cards in this like there are in Agricola. I think both are weaker than Le Havre.

I really like this one.  I think people are right in saying that it feels crammed with every different mechanic that the designer could think of, but that doesn't change the strange fascination that I have with it.  I like that it is a perfect information game.  The only random elements are in the initial setup, and after that there are so many paths that you can take.  They interact so subtly that I haven't even begun to figure them out.
I think many people are 'over' this game, but I still look forward to playing it again.

Great theme, clever and polished rules and nice mechanism - Caylus is all of these. 

After many plays I'm totally into this game. What I like the most is that everything in the game is balanced and fast. Each of every mechanism is oiled and easy to understand. The game for me absolutely feels like I'm a masterbuilder of the 13th century in the medieval Kingdom of France. I mean, besides the strong euro-side of the game, there is a well fitted and supported theme.
The game is complex, but it's easy to teach. The rulebook is exceptional and well written. Under a short period of time everyone in my gaming group got fast acquainted with the game.

The word 'agressiv' is too much to describe how the game feels to me in a good way, but it isn't peaceful at all. You need to be a cunning strategist who can easily adapt to the changing situations and who immediatly can choose the best of the available actions whose number is always limited or surely decreasing. You need to plan and think ahead. 

I really enjoy how the competition among players results in building up a magnificent village. Ok, I must confess, I remember that our first play produced a really poorly built village. But since then our villages and of course, gameplays constantly get better. :)

I own the new Ystari edition of the game from 2012. It's beautiful and really a piece of art. 

Great, fast, clever - this is Caylus. :D
No doubt, my rating is 10 points.

RATING: 3
So the board game community's hunt for the Next Big Eurogame apparently ends here...and of course, the usual excessive praising of a good but not necessarily groundbreaking or innovative game has followed.  I have to admit I wasn't really interested in Caylus, particularly after reading the rules and anticipating yet another Euro with a worn-out theme, crappy art, and and typical gameplay that rewards exploitation of procedure over creative strategy.  Nonetheless, I gave it a shot and I'm impressed that it was at least interesting and in some spots quite smart- it's probably the best new Euro I've played in a while, but that isn't really saying much.  That being said, I think  the game is pretty dry and boring despite some welcome nastiness and I think overall this is more of a flowchart than a game- seriously, it's all about who can exploit the procedural structure of the game more than anything else.  I'm really surprised that the I-hate-luck crowd is digging this because in Caylus other players' actions have a much more detrimental effect on strategy on this than rolling a dice ever have- you can literally be put out of the game by fault of simply going after another player.  The game has an otherwise really tight design and there is a good sense of development throughout that really makes for some interesting decisions and the possibility for several strategic and tactical avenues to pursue- just be flexible or you'll be eff-you-see-kaid, which is another problem because there are way too many "There's nothing else I can do but make this suboptimal move" moments- indeed, I'd say that 1/3 to 1/2 of my decisions throughout a typical game were circumstantially forced on me rather than through my own strategic planning or speculation.  There's definitely elements of Keythedral and other Richard Breese designs here, but this is probably a better development of that designer's ideas but those games were much more fun than Caylus.  All in all, it's an OK game, that's about it.  Nothing new, nothing terribly exciting, and no action we haven't performed in a hundred other games this year alone.  As far as the length goes, the problem is that a player's plans can literally change throughout the turn sequence causing the beard-stroking min-maxers to have to recalculate every five minutes.  My group has had no problem going through the game in 90 minutes.  A big "so what" I guess is my response to all the hype- it used to be that Euro games of this quality were par for course, now they're exceptions given the glut of German game junk that's been cranked out over the past few years.   Honestly though, I'll likely never play this game again, and in 10 years you probably won't even remember its name.

Rather simple, well written (english) rules, but a gameplay with lots of difficult choices. Nearly perfect blend of nicly working game mechanics, the provost and bailiff couple movement along the road is a fantastic unique idea. Rating based on a three player game, might be even higher for 4 or 5 players because I expect more building activities (with three players it is easier for a leading player to move the provost down the road as strategy to let the game end fast).

Hard to avoid comparing this to Agricola since they are both worker placement games. Agricola has fired this game for me, as it scratches the same itch.

At the end, Agricola gives you a nice little farm, but what does Caylus give? Prestige points on a track. Bleh.

Dull and lifeless. My first play at Origins took five players three hours to get through, and I didn't feel satisfied at the end.

Aug. 3rd, 2008 -- Two years later, I finally had a chance to give Caylus another try. It was a two-player game instead of the full five players like in the first play, so the game moved a lot quicker. It seemed there was more to do, but I still haven't really made my mind up about the game. It seems a bit dry. No change in rating 6/10

I like this less everytime I play it.  It takes about 20 minutes longer than I get enjoyment out of it.  While not a bad game it simply doesn't deliver back what you put into it.  While I don't consider it a 'bad' game it simply doesn't give me enough enjoyment for the time invested.

Update:  I like it as a two player if they are both experienced enough not to take forever.

Caylus... There is quite a bit of history attached to this game. When I first played it at Spiel (in 2005), I was, like many others, enamoured by the design. But the feeling of fun I had while in Essen did not reappear when I played the game at home (with my partner, so just with 2 players), and especially not when people at my local gaming club brought the title along so we could have a bit of exceedingly grating fun at 5 players. I was at the time too inexperienced with games in general to spot what Caylus was [i]truly[/i] about, and this was reflected in my comment for this game, which at the time of writing is in its fifth or sixth revision. I argued about player chaos, skill level differences, playing time, and a few other things... Issues those were, yes, but there were more subtle problems lurking beneath the surface. But since I never felt comfortable playing the game, I didn't really explore why.

Enter the cardgame Caylus Magna Carta, CMC for short. The cardgame did away with certain mechanics in the game (for example the bailiff, the favours, one resource), streamlined the entire thing (getting rid of many buildings, making resources much easier to obtain and money more difficult), and added a fun piece of hand management. [i]There[/i] I did get a handle on what made Caylus 'tick', and found that I could enjoy it, provided I didn't make stupid errors like forgetting that yes, efficiency of resource conversion is indeed important. The more complex and involved original was relegated to the closet; spurred by the comments of many who played CMC that they found it easier to grasp and play—certainly an issue in casual game groups. This quickly led me favouring CMC over the original, which had been stuck in its box for so long that I eventually sold it off without a second thought.

Sometime before the original was sold, the expansion for CMC appeared, and after giving [i]that[/i] some test runs, I discovered that it gave the somewhat cramped base game a boost of fluidity and strategy alternatives which were really quite welcome. In fact I hadn't realised that the game actually needed this bit of strengthening. Or perhaps 'needed' is too large a word; 'profited from' is a better way of phrasing it. But there was a downside too: the expanded CMC now really took a long time to play to completion, a shame really.

And with all that knowledge [i]now[/i] go back to the original, this title therefore, and play with 3 players. Frankly, afterwards I looked over my comments and could not really understand the hubbub. There were differences, yes, but they were not as big as I wanted them to be. The player chaos? Well, that's a consequence of a luckless design and having very few buildings for players to use in the beginning (and still not that many near the end). At 4 and especially 5 getting Caylus up and running can be a pain for inexperienced gamers: the contention is murder, and you don't have a feeling of 'getting anywhere' because resources are simply hard to obtain. In addition getting buildings along the road is just messy. Don't even get me started on prestige buildings. Skill level differences? Well... yes, they are important, and then perhaps the card game has the advantage of 'easing' the player into the rythm of using other player's buildings to gain an advantage. But surely with just two or three players the feeling of being able to do a lot without being checked all the time is ubiquitous. It makes it more important at the high end of the player scale... But really, don't play at that number then if that is a serious issue!

And so forth. A lot of little things clicked into place, meaning I can finally consider this game without the burden of inexperience or fear for its complexity. My verdict is now going to be: solid game, rewards repeated plays, is probably very good material for large groups of experienced gamers... But there are some issues which cause me to rate it somewhat below the cardgame. There are too many little mechanisms in place (bailiff, castle section end scoring, penalty for not constructing a castle section, building buildings too cumbersome, favours coupled to castle section, ...) which can easily be removed from the game without loss to Caylus' inner core of arbitrary cross-player reuse of previously laid down action tiles. This title makes it clear that the player has to deal with all the little details, and that he has to go through a lot of motions which don't really add anything worthwhile save for it becoming yet another detail to consider, or for the fourth and fifth player to have something to do without introducing too much resources and thus upsetting the balance as-is. In that the cardgame is simply better: you can more readily manage the game's core directly instead of managing the core's outer layers so that in the next turn(s?) you can finally get some stuff done.

Was I right in selling off the original? Yes and no. I feel that with the expansion the cardgame provides me with everything I need from this particular set of mechanics, so in that the sale was justified. But no, it wasn't right because I did not have a good idea of [i]why[/i] I thought about Caylus the way I did. I'll make up by boosting the game's rating to what it deserves at thein my opinion best number of players to play this game with, namely three: a 6. Will I play anew with four or two, or perhaps even five? I can't honestly say. But the issues I now have clear in my mind won't go away, so I guess I'll always suggest we do CMC instead, if necessary with the expansion.

[u]2 PLAYERS[/u]: Played too long ago to remember.
[u]3 PLAYERS[/u]: 6
[u]4 PLAYERS[/u]: 5 at best, already there is notable friction in getting the game going, and forcing players into certain directions because the obvious options are taken.
[u]5 PLAYERS[/u]: < 4 because in my memory, it is an exceedingly grating mess. Even these days I will not willingly play this game with 5.

RATING: 8
A much more interesting game than it appears at first, Caylus succeeds where other worker-placement games don't by making the core VP engine (namely, castle building) directly competitive.

I do need to lower its score some from where I originally had it (10), though, since it's kinda hard to justify the game being over 2 hours long when the winner is usually decided in 30 minutes.

RATING: 7.8
Caylus is good but always seems to be a long game for us and a little dry.  But the great thing is there are so many possible paths to victory...  We usually have a close game and every dollar counts.  There is so much strategy my brain hurts. :)

Acquired Nov 2007 - First game March 2008.  Rating based on less than 5 plays.

This is it!  This seems to be the worker placement game that I was looking for.  Yes, it is a long game to play, but it is so much fun to plan your attack.  I've played Pillars, Cuba, Stone Age,  etc before playing this one and I can see that they are all lighter copies of this design.  I'm very much looking forward to repeated plays of this one and consider it a treat whenever I can table it.

Por fín probé el famoso Caylus y... aburrimiento! Preguntando a cada poco cuánto quedaba para terminar. Hay mucho puteo; tanto que te puedes quedar sin hacer casi nada en la ronda; para eso prefiero 1000000 veces el Carson City (que los comparan tanto y no sé por qué) que es mucho más divertido. Un clásico que ya ha sido superado por otros euros más modernos. Decepción!

This is my preliminary rating (8), based on two plays, and it could potentially go up.  I doubt it will go down.  I thought this was a fanastic game, and even with my raised expectations based on the positive early evaluations, I was not at all disappointed.

Update:  Boy was I wrong.  This game really got old fast for me, for some reason.  I don't look forward to playing again any time soon.

Update: I traded Caylus away, mainly because I got a chance to try Caylus Magna Carta.  CMC has everything I originally liked about Caylus, but played in half the time, or less. I can't imagine a situation where I'd choose to play Caylus over Caylus Magna Carta.

What a cool game!  Caylus is a neat worker placement type euro game with unique game mechanisms that force competition among the players through out each and every game turn on an incremental basis.  The game design is clever and the buildings in the kingdom are well thought out for initial creation and re-use by players as the game progresses.  This game is fantastic with 2, 3, 4 or even 5 players.  This is also a heavy thinker euro style game as players need to machinate many plays and the order of resolution of those plays.  Money management is also important as it is not necessarily the amount of money one has, but whether one has enough or more money than his opponents and enough money each turn to not get squeezed in his ability to do actions.  Adding flavor to the game is the dynamic of the bailiff and provost which allows players to game the system or suggestively intimidate other players with certain control mechanisms available for play each turn.  This fantastic game has great replayability and is highly enjoyable.  Caylus is one of my favorite, fun to play euro style games of all time.

This feels more like work than a game. "I just burned some brain cells" ... not for me. Too dry, I guess, and one bad decision can kill you. Very unforgiving. Just ... not for me.

Update: up to 7 since I appreciate the complexity and the many ways one can win (or lose). Still a bit dry, but it slowly grows on me. Could be a bit shorter, and it would be played more often. Ah, well.

The one thing I dislike most about Caylus is the white thingy that goes back and forth and screws plans. The game would be better without it.

[EDIT: After repeated plays, it's less shiny and I'm seeing some of its rough spots. Still, I enjoy it, if I'm playing with folks who can decide moves swiftly, though it comes out less often than other games due to its potential length.]

I bought this new for $54.99.  I believe I researched it before buying it.  It's a very competitive game for up to 5 players.  New players do not perform well.

This is one of the few worker placement games that I own and really like.  Nice game components, board and rulebook.  I believe they reissued the game with a different board, but as the same game - the board has quite different artwork.

I've played it twice now, and my opinion of it hasn't changed all that much. While it was somewhat interesting, it just wasn't fun.Definitely not a bad game, but I just don't understand all the fawning over it. It has some interesting mechanisms, some of which take getting used to. Its most serious drawback is the length of time to play it; if you're going to play it well, you're going to need time to think about the many, many options as well as try to predict what the other players will do. Both games I've played now have gone to the three-hour mark, which is not a good thing.Update - I've played it four more times, and I'm convinced this game is way too overrated. A small number of mid-game errors can make this two-plus-hour-long game painful as you slowly watch yourself torn apart by a good player. I really want to like this game, but I just can't.

1 game learning curve. The 1VP reward for using other's buildings is too small. Always starts SSSLLOOWW, and is way way too long for what it is. Has nothing in common with Puerto Rico. 61+ pages of rules articles shows the clunkiness of this game. Painful/boring blocking strategies (some intentional, othersd not) abound.

When you learn to play Caylus it is a great game. Little rules, distilled concepts and a very complete and tight experience. Zero luck, non scripted start, tactic and strategic play and growing confrontation, with a very exciting ending. First matches can be dry, chaotic and long, but if you persist playing perhaps can find gem inside this game.

Played with 2 and 4 players. Different but very funny in both cases.

Excellent game.  Very well balanced. Every move affects others even if you pass.  Time goes by quickly.  The only luck in game is who gets to place where first.  Good strategy and tactic game.  I recommend reading rules and then have someone read the rules to you while going through dry run if no one has played before. Board is intuitive and didnt need to go back to rule book very often. Wife likes it and she doesn't really enjoy medium to heavy weight games. Multiple ways to win.  No game is ever the same although it is worker placement which can make it seem somewhat slow at beginning. Best balanced game i have ever seen.  One of my favorite.  Other great games of this level: el grande, tigris and euphrates, castles of burgundy, cities and knights (catan), stone age, agricola, puerto rico,etc.

One of my favorite strategic game. Unfortunately we didn't play it very often due to high learning curve (or better: people who knows the buildings are always ahead wrt the ones who don't know them). Great mechanics.
EDIT: lowered the rating, after several plays it looks like it's not a title beloved by our playgroup, and in effect I really don't want to play it so often due to complexity.

This worker placement is well designed game that was enjoyable but I'd like to play this again as I didn't do so well and the jury is still out on this game because in the 5 player game, I didn't go for resources early and paid for it during the rest of the game. I tried to focus on favours but this didn't help me either. We played with 5 and I'd like to try it with 3 players.

An excellent, excellent game.  Tons of options for strategic and tactical play with multiple paths to victory, lots of interaction, practically no downtime, beautiful graphics and outstanding graphic design.

RATING: 6.7
2nd game: having gotten used to the rules and options, I enjoyed it more. But the massive array of options (for example, building options) open at the start feels too much and slightly inelegant. I feel that a better game would find a way to reduce the number of things we need to choose between at any one time.

Go ahead and stick your brain in the microwave before playing this so that you can get a sense of what it's going to feel like after a couple hours of this game.

Is that a bad thing?  Not necessarily.

Just be prepared for a decision-heavy stress-fest that provides great feelings of accomplishment when you do something that works, and harsh feelings of self-loathing when you do something that fails.

This is the epitome of the low-luck, open-information, efficiency, optimization Eurogame. Such clean, intuitive rules, yet complex enough to make for excellent replayability. Very simple to set up, requires minimal table space, and turns go quickly. 

Caylus is a brain burner, and one that can take many plays to develop a good strategy to become a competetive player. This is a game where the players really play each other. The provost mechanic is simply brilliant. Mean enough to allow for clever manipulation, but not too punishing to make players frustrated with the game (I'm looking at you, Vanuatu!).

A pesar de que hay que tener en cuenta muchos aspectos durante el transcurso de la partida y tener que pensar con dos turnos de antelacion, el tablero consigue que se puedan recoger todos los datos de la partida (que no son pocos) con un simple vistazo, mientras se lleva el orden del turno si que puedan haber confusiones sobre lo que toca resolverse en cada momento.

Finally managed to learn and play a classic. At the surface, it's just a worker placement game in a machine to earn points. The interesting twist on happens when players construct additional worker positions in the town and are then rewarded each time another player uses their spaces. This makes it a race to build out high value and useful tiles quickly to slowly gain points from the other players. Manipulation of the provost also allows players to control the pacing of the game as well as forcing other players to keep just enough money around to counter your manipulation of the provost. This leads to a slight cold war style game where players may choose to manipulate things but it could also lead to retaliation by the other players depending on pass order.

This turned out to be much better than anticipated.  Royal Favors may be a little overpowered, and the game is slightly longer than I had hoped (maybe get Magna Carta?), but still had a good time. Signed box cover by the designer, with the jeweller tile (which essentially makes it the 2nd edition).

RATING: 7
Good management game. Deep, interesting. Maybe a tad too long, but time usually flies by.

*********************************************************
Update: downgrade from 9 to 8: Since I do not like the 5 player game, I guess that Caylus will hit the table rarely, since Caylus Magna Charta is quicker and almost as interesting (more balanced and still varied enough even if the winning options look narrowed).

*********************************************************
Update: down to 7.5. Without a doubt, Agricola is more entertaining and more varied than Caylus. I don't mind the deck randomness (it makes the game less "serious") when it adds such a plethora of viable game approaches. 

*********************************************************
Update: down to 7. Uwe strikes back. Le Havre corrects Caylus in the other direction with respect to Agricola, offering a more strategic game,with better narrative arc and broader choices, at the cost of a relatively longish gameplay. My desire to play Caylus consequently fades a little bit. Now I see Magna Charta as the preferred game of the Caylus family.

RATING: 9
- Gameplay and replayability: 4/4. As this is a perfect information game that is void of luck, it is a great game if you are looking for a brain burner. Expect to be tired after a match of Caylus! However, in exchange for the effort you get lots of fun and excitement. It is nice to pick a strategy and first invest a little before reaping its benefits. Another fun aspect is the nailbiting worker placement phase in which you have to take the other player's preferred actions into account and act preemptively on this, trying to block them and avoiding they block the actions you want to do.

- Absence of luck: 4/4. There are no random elements, and other players can disturb your game almost only if intended. I'd call Caylus chess-like were it not that it does have a totally different feel to it.

- Duration: 2/4. My last 2 and 4 player games took some 3 hours (the number of players doesn't influence the duration much). Even if those 3 hours are lots of fun, it is a bit too long to hit the table often, especially considering the mental effort it takes. I would hesitate to play this after a hard day's work, which is a bit of a pity. A nice thing though is that unlike the total duration suggests, Caylus plays quickly: you never have to wait long until your next turn.

- Player range: Caylus is superb with 2 players and it is also great with 3 or 4.

- Theme and looks: 3/4. The board is beautiful, and although the colored cubes and cylinders do abstract the theme away I do feel it creates a medieval atmosphere.

- Set up/clean up time: 4/4. Can be set up and cleaned up in 5 minutes or so.

- Learning curve and documentation. 2/4. Caylus has quite a lot of rules to learn. For a newcomer there will be a lot to swallow at once, and it takes at least one game to get to know the tiny-but-important aspects of the game. It is just impossible for a first time player to win the game. If you have to learn the game through the rulebook instead of by getting an explanation and guidance by someone that already knows the game, expect to have to study a few hours. But however difficult the rules may seem at first, they become easy and straightforward after playing a game or two.
Because of the rather extended rule set, Caylus requires a bit more documentation than an average game. The manual is good and the in-game documentation is great, but I do think a reference sheet is indispensable. Especially if it has been a while after the last play, you need an overview to quickly get up to speed again. I always wonder why there are so little games that provide this. One would expect that this can't be too hard for a game developer. Luckily there is boardgamegeek for you.

- Like: interactive, zero luck, strategic, competitive, engine building, large player range, short waiting time between turns

- Dislike: rather long, no reference sheet, colored cubes hurt the theme

Ouch. Said my brain.  I love Caylus. When I bought Caylus, the only notable games I had played were Settlers, Carcassonne, and Puerto Rico - Caylus blew my mind. My one reason this is not a ten is because it takes 2 games to have a basic understanding of the game. It is difficult to learn and difficult to teach but boy is it fun when everyone knows what is going on.

De eerste keer dat ik dit spel speelde vond ik er maar weinig aan. Ik vond het veel te zwaar. Als je worker placement spellen als Stenen Tijdperk, Agricola, Fresco, Carson City, enz gewoon bent, dan valt Caylus toch een heel stuk zwaarder uit. Ik zag wel goede spelmechanismen en daarom besloot ik om deze grootvader van de worker placements toch nog een tweede kans te geven. Daar heb ik geen spijt van. Ik las de regels opnieuw en in mijn tweede spel viel alles (toch grotendeels) op zijn plaats. Ik begon het leuk te vinden. Caylus is een zwaar, maar heel leuk spel voor spelers die graag hun hersenen laten knarsen. Volgens mij is dit één van de pittigste spellen die ik ooit heb gespeeld (samen met Imperial 2030 en Race for the galaxy). De lange speelduur is een nadeel, al verveel ik me niet tijdens dit spel.

This one was of my first worker placement game, so I enjoyed it initially. Lots of decisions to make without dice or cards. Unfortunately, after a recent play, my rating plummeted.

First, knowing the tiles in advance can provide a significant advantage over noobs, so you have to avoid playing with sharks. Second, I think this game has been fired by games like [i]Dominant Species[/i] and [i]Lancaster[/i]. I just don't see the appeal of this game over newer, better AP games.

Good deep game with many ways to win and every game would seem to pan out a bit differently (at least until "best strategies" start to emerge). It gets a little fiddly with the constant spending & earning of cheap money but is otherwise a very simple mechanism. I may tire of it after we're 'cracked' it.

Rating has gone up. Great depth to this game that is perhaps a little too abstract at first blush. Could have used a little more development in that the buildings don't all pay off the amount you want to allow as many possible strategies to emerge as one would like. Still plenty of different approaches.

Bridge mechanic is a little weird and quasi-cooperative in a game that doesn't really call for negotiation. But have not come up with anything better to replace it.

Great, but a brain burner and a bit long, yet it doesn't feel that dry.  It seems what causes a lot of the downtime is trying to keep track in your head of what you'll be able to do by the end of the turn (of course it's amusing when someone else gets it wrong, and a tragedy when you get it wrong :-).

I finally got to play Caylus tonight, twelve years after its original release. It holds up, but it didn't blow me away. I think it was so influential, and has been so often imitated, that it felt like I've already played it many times. This came as a surprise, because usually when I play older Euros I see directions in game design that were abandoned: Mexica, Endeavor, and Maharaja are examples of games that I love that did not strongly influence the designs of the following decade. Caylus (a worker placement, point salad, resource converter) was just the opposite: there is no part of it that hasn't been stolen over and over again. That's to the designer's credit, and if I had found it ten years ago it would probably still be a favorite, but entering the game today felt a bit like entering a looted tomb.

A very good worker placement, perfect information game.  There is much to adore here but also a couple of flaws: the game is a little bit too long since all the turns are really quite similar and the economy is so very, very tight that the movement of provost can really completely wreck your plans, thus leaving you with absolutely nothing to do for the whole turn.

RATING: 4
Caylus is a worker placement resource management game that is quite heavy.  I don't think is is that deep, but there are a lot of things to consider to keep yourself from slipping up with a silly mistake.  So you'll need to remember that the joust happens before other "favor" options, that red (or some other player) will get 3 gold before you can move the Provost, that several things can trigger the scoring round, the amount of resources each player has, etc.  If you are willing to take the time to remember all of the options, and then follow the order that everything will happen in, you have done 90% of what you will need to do to play the game well.  It is the last 10% of the game that requires good judgement, and that is the 10% that I enjoy quite a bit.   

As you can probably tell, Caylus is not my favorite type of game.  It demands your whole attention, but only because you have to think everything through without forgetting one of the many facets.  It is mostly a cluttered memory game, and I don't like cluttered games.  They lead to Analysis Paralysis in a lot of players.   I prefer a games with simple choices (where you can see the trade-offs right away), but making the right play takes good judgment.  Those games move quicker, and are more enjoyable for me to play.

Even so, if you are willing to take the time to learn the game, and you are in the right mood (which comes a couple of times a year for me), then the activity of playing can be quite enjoyable.

Sloooooooooooooow. Sounded great when I first read the rules a few years ago but has never grabbed me after 3 or 4 in person plays and another half dozen of the iOS version. The provost mechanic is somewhat interesting, if a bit mean-spirited for this type of game. I think my main complaint is that I don't feel much of an "arc" in this game - I'm not building a civ or gaining much over time; each turn just feels very similar as we move along, only it gets slower and slower as it goes.

To me, this should be pretty high up there on any list of JASE examples.

Fantastic game that might easily get a 10 rating after some more plays.

There's almost no downtime which is amazing considering all the of decisions you have to make each turn. To make things even better there are many different paths to victory which increases the replayability a lot.

Update: The game is just a little too long to get a higher rating. Had it been playable in 1-2 hours it would have been a 10 for me.

RATING: 7
Deserving of its regard, Caylus is a brilliant game.  The sinister difficulty is largely based on the building track, which is different every game and resolved in order.  This makes planning sequences of actions different every time you play and you cannot default to stock strategy.  It lacks a certain fun factor for me, or I might rate it an 8 or 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
My main complaint with the game is how the Baliff moves two spaces so often and shortens the game, so how in the heck does the game still take so long?  And the turn order mechanism blows; if you are going last the Stables is a required move if you want to be anything other than reactionary/lucky.  So just rotate the turn order.  Boiling down this game around the coolness of the constructed buildings would be awesome.  Funny thing, just read about Caylus Magna Carta, and it looks like it will do exactly that.

Update 6-4:  Not only does CMC concentrate on the fun part, it is a completely better game.  CMC shows what an overblown bore this game is.

I love the choices the game presents.  Similiar to Puerto Rico except there are so many more things to choose from.  And my main gripe about Puerto Rico (player seat position) is solved. Just an altogether, excellent, well-thought out game that I always want to play.  I never expect this to change, thus my rating has finally been upgraded to a 10.   My last worry about the game was that the play could become one-dimensional towards the Victory Point favor track.  But I've seen the money route and the building route win.  So I think there is some good balance.  Even if the Victory Point track proves to be the best, it is still a great game. Heck it would be great even if the only favor track was the victory points.  This game is my favorite 3 player game I own, and it's up there for 4er games.

Still a great game, but showing some age now.  Bumping down from 10 to a 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Even with the wave of worker placement games that have been inspired by it, Caylus still stands out as a distinct and fun experience. The game is all about maneuvering around favors in general (and the building track in particular), but there is enough of a universe around that competition to make the game rewarding and variable, even with a very small amount of luck.

RATING: 5
Players are developing a town that will support workers, and enable a castle to be built.  Each turn the players send their workers out to work the fields, shops, and to the castle construction site.  The players juggle money, gather coloured wooden cubes that mean "food", "cloth", etc, and spend their stuff on other things.  Long term, it's all about gaining prestige.  The game works, but it's rather long, and soon begins to feel a bit same-y.  Once the buildings form, the game essentially begins to play itself.  Plug cubes in, out pop points, and the bloom is quickly off the rose.  Lots of justified comparisons to Puerto Rico, Keythedral and Goa - however these are all games that are 60+ minutes quicker than Caylus, and thus they will hit the table ahead of it.  (But, Caylus isn't bad as a meaty 2 player game!).

Little more than a long, dry, convoluted perversion of Breese's fun underrated classic Aladdin's Dragons. But unlike Aladdin's Dragons, there's no fun, no bluff, and no bidding, and no hidden info. Just sequential taking stuff and guessing what will be left when your turn comes around again.
 
The more players you add the less there is to go around for everyone, so beware the five-player game.
 
Along with Age of Steam, this game typifies the recent trend of long, overanalytical and ruthless economic games that reward exploiting procedure to the detriment of the other players.

Quite enjoyed my first two games, but there's something that bugs me. Unlike other building games, you don't have much of a "position", besides your cube supply and favor track. Yes, I've built buildings and got VP's for them, but they don't feel like they're "mine": Either they're good enough that others will use them if I don't, or they're not worth the denier to me (too far down the road/not very powerful). Perhaps if more of the buildings offered side-benefits to the owner?

A good game yet i found myself thinking as we passed the 2 hour mark "how much longer?". If this game played in less than 2 hrs it might rate a 7 or 8 but I honestly can say this one will be easy to turn down because of its length. 

BTW – The 5 player game lasted over 2-1/2 hrs not including 15 min rules explanation. All the players were quick to make their moves so even with experienced people you can expect this one to last 30+ min per player. If you play with the AP impaired you might as well cancel your plans for the next few days.

RATING: 6
August 2014. I recently revisited Caylus after not playing it for many years. I was very curious how it would stand up after living through the evolution of worker placement games in the interim. 

My conclusion: Man alive, this game is BRUTALITY in a box in a way best appreciated in retrospect.  With clever play, you can totally hose over your opponents, and with the slightest mistake totally hose over yourself.  This game reminds me there was a time when you weren't handed out some ration of VPs every turn just for showing up and Eurogames would let you fail. I'm talking about the before times when new Knizia games were awesome and points weren't served up at a salad bar. If you suck up a turn in Caylus, you get nothing, you lose, GOOD DAY SIR!  That's jarring in the present day.  However, it is magnificent gaming, and I'm so glad that we can enjoy the current style of games without losing the old. 

UPDATE Aug 2014: All that being said, I think maybe I don't actually so much enjoy this game, because against a good opponent, it is HARD.  I am not sure how fun I ultimately find this game.  I'd like to say it's because the game is rather dry, but I'm afraid it is because I don't want to work this hard.  Maybe if my wife didn't destroy me every time...but she does that at Agricola too and I still enjoy that.  I also tend to prefer games with more of a dynamic setup.  I think I am going to try Tzolk'in, as I think it might scratch the same itch without drawing blood.

UPDATE Sep 2014: Curse you Caylus!  I am now thinking that what I need to do is not to trade away Caylus, but to get better at playing Caylus.  I call this "Agricola syndrome".  I have realized that one thing that throws me about this game is that you don't really build up your own personal infrastructure.  Anyone can use the buildings you construct for a relatively minor payment.  This makes it difficult to build things that benefit you without helping your opponents.  Maybe that payment isn't so minor in the long haul, and your personal infrastructure comes from those baby payments.  There are definitely still some things to explore here.  

Last game my wife and I tried to starve each other out by not building and passing early.  We only had a few buildings the whole game.  It was a very different experience and I was impressed that the game still worked in this extreme mode (although it wasn't the most fun way to play).  Once she caught on to what I was doing, she out-stingied me anyway.

Update Sept 2014:  I finally played a game reasonably well.  However, I think Tzolkin may have further spoiled Caylus for me.  I love the variable setup that Tzolkin offers.  Caylus si the same every time, and I'm not sure what there is to stop me from trying to pursue the same strategy every time.  I prefer it when the game itself forces you to change up your approach.  I also in generally don't like it when controlling the timing of the end of the game or needing to dominate the last turn is a big issue, and it surely is here.

Final update? Sept 2014: I think is the end.  The more I play this, the more joyless I find it.  We had our ups and downs Caylus, but it is time for us to part.  I revisited you to see how you fared in the modern day, and while I admire you for being a pioneer, your descendants have surpassed you in Fun.  Farewell, and I wish you well.

RATING: 8
Caylus is big, complex, and deep.  The genius of Caylus is that there is that no one way to win, there are many different strategies that can all lead to victory (or defeat).  Building the kings castle, constructing the town around it, building monuments, and gaining royal favors all offer paths to victory.  Each option is well balanced and a few or all can be used at once.  The direct competition between players can also be intense as each vies to place their workers on the various buildings.  This game requires a significant investment of time to play, but it's a real treat each time I do.

My biggest disappointment of the year.  I was really looking forward to this game.  This is the first time in a long time that I wished I was playing something else while this game was on the table.  When the game was over I wasn't happy about the journey (and a long journey at that) I had just taken,  I was simply happy it was over.  I think the game tries to do too much and in the end does nothing very well.  Don't try to teach this one to casual gamers.  Caylus is almost as much fun as watching the grass grow.

ANOTHER UPDATE: It's still a "9" for me, because I still enjoy the game very much. I finally saw someone win without the bottom favor track so my former complaint has been dispelled. 

UPDATE: After further plays, I'm tempted to bump it down to an 8, but I'm keeping it at a 9 because it's simply a very fun game. My current complaint is that strategy doesn't appear to be as varied as I first thought. It appears to be "solved" in that the building favor track is far and away the best strategy. I have yet to see someone win without it. Therefore, the game can be, dare I say, a little one-dimensional. 

Wow! This game deserves all of the hype. Have only played once, but was amazed at how fluid the game progressed and how many possible strategies one can pursue. Absolutely cannot wait to play again.

If you're going to judge a game by how long after release it's still getting played, Caylus is pretty high up there.  I still enjoy this grandaddy of worker-placement, and feel like it's aged quite well.

It has a couple rough edges.  I don't feel like all the strategies scale well with different player counts, and 5 is probably too many for the game.  (Frequently someone gets hosed on the last turn because the castle filled all the way up, and they can't build. That means no positive points, and a double-whammy penalty.)
Similarly, the blue buildings are a neat capstone, but they seem super hard to get to.  You've got to either dedicate to that particular favor track to slowly guarantee yourself a shot at it, or force the pace of the game along by building the builders that build the more advanced buildings, etc.  The vast majority of the blue buildings will never be touched, and I'm pretty sure there are some that have never been built in [i]any[/i] game.  Even the wood & stone buildings have some duds, and often come out in the same pattern.

I wanted to like Caylus, it is smart, it is fluid, it is well-produced, it is not fun.  It is a brain-burner and AP prone and that dragged the game down for us on both occasions.

Played twice and first game we quit halfway through and played Agricola instead.  Second game with a different crowd was better but for a group that likes to brain through games... the payoff and process felt too dry.

A game I was told that was a precursor for most all worker placement games (and predecessor to one of my favorite games, Lords of Waterdeep). I thank the game makers for that.

I now feel that worker placement games are my favorite genre. It is so much fun assigning workers and accomplishing something for the temporary and end game goals.

This game is a little more intense and you have to be more careful on what you do I feel, but it is still a really fun one.

Possibly deserves a higher rating but euros don't quite capture my imagination in the way that other styles do.

I think compared with Brass, or Castles of Burgundy (the two more serious euros I am most familiar with) this is a less focused design. In both those games all the systems integrate really well. Here i felt the bonuses you get for pleasing the king and the construction of the actual castle were a bit bolted on to a game about building town tiles. Also perhaps the different resource cubes were a bit too flexible. For a euro of this reputation i found the game amazingly forgiving. 

On the plus side, there are quite a view viable strategy routes, and this is does require a longer term strategic approach than tactical. Its quite possible to do well ignoring the castle building. You can also do a bit of engine building and pull some clever moves monopolising certain resources.

Brass is probably better though..

It's really cool. But I don't always want to play it. Feels like a much more interactive game of Puerto Rico. And some of the mechanics don't shine (or make sense) until you play with at least four.

Szerelem első látásra. Graz, játék kiállítás. (Essen messze, Bécsről lekéstünk). Itt ismerkedtünk meg vele, csak 1 kört játszottunk vele, de mind a 4-en azt mondtuk: ez igen. Aztán az olaszo-i síelésre már becsomagoltam, és 4-en az egész napi síelés után két este is hajnalig játszottunk vele. Tetszik, h nem egy út vezet a célba, tetszik, h ha hibázom, akkor ha elég kreatív vagyok, akkor újra van esélyem a győzelemre. A széles lehetőségek, a mindig megújulási esély. És nekem tetszik is. Sajna többnyire csak második vagyok benne 1-2 ponttal lemaradva Kedvesemtől, aki mesterien játszotta eddig a játékot.
Update: hosszú kihagyás (1,5 év?) után újra elővettük. Még mindig zseniális, és még mindig  a top.

Played my first game and finished dead last. It took a while to know why I was doing some actions. I couldn't see things in the long term. At games end, I understood it more but it was a little late. I would want to give to game another try...I can't possibly do any worst.

A game can last a couple of hours. It has interesting game mechanics. I heard that Caylus is either a hit or a miss for some people. 

Caylus is basically resource management. I would need to play it again to give more details about the game. My first game was basically learning how the game works. So there was a lot to learn in one game.

TRADED my cousin's copy.

Got it in a game trade.

While it can be interesting, the system is so convoluted that it becomes virtually a memory game. Just remember to get those 3 coins so you can buy that meat cube so you can add to the castle so you can get that favor so you can build that blue building that gets you all those VPs - Or else you lose. 

For me, at least, this is just not fun.

I held off getting this for a long time, but decided to go for it after playing at the MK Monthly Gaming session.  Since then it has hit the table many times.  My 18 yr old daughter wins most times ... I am determined to get my own back.
The main thing with this game is that there are no dice, cards or other random elements.

RATING: 7
60-150 minutes? Who are they kidding? I've yet to play a game that took under 2 hours, including a pair of 2-player games. Nonetheless, this is an interesting game. I expect to be playing it for a while to come. It's heavy enough, though, that I doubt it'll hit the table that often. It requires too much continuous concentration for that.

It could possibly be an 8 for now, but I think that after another several plays it'll be a solid 7.

I'm not sure why, but I just have no urge to play this. Other games do everything it does *better*.

The more worker placement games I play, the more I'm convinced this is the best one - even better than my beloved Tzolk'in.  The only reason I don't rate it higher is that I haven't played it enough.  The tension in this game runs high.  The economy is tight, the planning involved is rigorous, the competition for worker placement is fierce, and the jockeying for the King's Favor is nail biting.  It's a masterpiece!

RATING: 8.8
This is a fairly thematic game about acquiring resources in order to build up a king's kingdom.  The player the king likes the most at the end of the game wins.

Building things in the king's kingdom makes the king happy.  If another player chooses to use a building you constructed, that helps your reputation with the king and that makes the king like you a little bit more.  If you tell the king you are going to build part of his castle and you don't, he likes you less.  If you build more, he likes you more.  If you build the most in a round or build as much as the other players and commit to doing it first (the other players likely simply appear as copy-cats to the king), the king additionally offers a favor to you for your good work.  If you choose the points track at the top, that is like politely declining the king's offer, which simply makes him like you more.  Repeatedly doing this makes him like you progressively more.  The bottom favor track seems to involve the player responding to the king along these lines: "Good king, I would like to request a special favor of you.  If I again find myself in your good graces and you feel I am worthy of receiving your favor, please allow me to construct a building for you in your kingdom."  And the king responds along the lines of, "If you again do something worthy of receiving my favor, if you so choose, I will entrust you with one of my men skilled in carpentry for a small project in town and I will provide you with some of my wood which you may use if you oversee the construction of a wooden building."

Once we'd got our heads round the detail, the feeling of complexity was reduced. However, it is always going to be quite a long game, though with plenty in it to keep us interested.

RATING: 7
It's surprising that I played this after Le Havre, Agricola, Stone Age, A Castle for All Seasons, Kingsburg, and Tribune.  My impression is that it's pretty good with multiple paths to victory.  There is also more interaction than simply blocking areas with your own workers because you can take actions to insure other players workers do not get to take their action.  Caylus is a major influence for a lot of games that came afterwards but I think it was the most innovative. That being said, the different favour tracks don't feel completely balanced to me.

Awesome awesome game. Probably my favorite. Works well from 2-4 players. 5 players is too many. If I had to rate the 5 player experience I would drop the rating from a 9 down to probably a 3. Other than that, this game is just ridiculous. Power Grid and this started my downward spiral.

This is a very fine game, a gamer's game if you want. The rules are very logical and there is a flow to the game that keeps everybody busy and involved, especially with the myriads of strategies involved. The abstracted graphic design is excellent, as it is really possible to understand everything that is depicted on the board quickly and without the use of text. Be prepared to play this a few times before you feel confident, this game is much less forgiving than even Puerto Rico. The only reason why this doesn't get a 10 by me is the fact that a) there is little to no theme here - you never feel a minute like you are building a medieval town, it's all about VP's and resources b) player interaction is limited to where you place your pawns. But every true gamer should feel obliged to play this game at least once, that's for sure.

Caylus is an old title, but it has certainly held its own. Despite having helped birth worker placement, Caylus' implementation of the mechanic is still incredibly unique, and unlike anything else on the market. The Bailiff & Provost add a healthy dose of meta-game into this solid Euro, forcing players to constantly jostle for position and plan carefully. The game also manages to shift priorities between the early- and late-game, which encourages players to experiment with and pivot to different strategies in a single session. The complete lack of randomness makes this a must play for the luck averse.

Caylus is the best resource management game I know.  Resources are always tight, so you have to think carefully to make the most of them, but it doesn't get bogged down in calculations.  The competitive worker placement forces you constantly reconsider and reprioritize, and the provost adds even more tension to this already tight game.  The balance is excellent, with even turn order under your control.  There is no randomness past the initial set-up, so there is nothing to undermine the strategy.

Like any game with little to no luck, the tactics in Caylus are unforgiving, with no room for error.  There is definitely a level of strategy beyond that, however, which I have not yet entirely fathomed.  Part of the key seems to be moderation - it is important to build as much as possible each turn, but at the same pushing too hard for one great turn is usually a mistake.  You have to be careful not to overextend yourself.   

Caylus does have a couple of minor disadvantages - it is a little long, it can be a little dry, there isn't a whole lot of opportunity to form long-term strategies, and I wish that the favor tracks were more balanced.  

Overall, though, Caylus is a fascinating resource management game that really makes you think hard about every move. It also works great with two, and is a favorite of both my wife and I.

Update Dec. 2017 - Pulled this out again after a couple years on the shelf (it's hard to find the time to play anymore) and was pleased to find that we love it as much as ever.  This is just a really phenomenal game - so tense and delicious and 100% luck free.

Caylus has many levers which players can operate, which gives it a very "intellectual" feel. But it comes across as very computational without that killer app. The mechanics of the game hang together functionally but don't really engage you. It's a straightforward "get resource, convert to VP" game. Like Puerto Rico, you'd say, but Caylus is a lot longer and a lot less engaging. It's a 2-hour game, when it should be a 1-hour game. PR is exciting. Caylus is not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game. Deep. Satisfying tactical choices and worker placement. 

Only thing preventing it from being rated higher is that it's a two hour+ game, and it's hard to learn to play competently so in my group which meets infrequently and often has new players replacing the old it's hard to justify breaking it out when the fun factor doesn't start to rev up until you've played your 2nd or 3rd game, 4-6 hours in or in my world, 2-3 evening sessions which occur maybe 1-2 a month....

It's hard to describe what I like best about Caylus.  It could be the most balanced game of all time.  Games are always close, yet it seems that the person who should win actually does win.

Tiene un inconveniente y es que aunque la mecánica del juego es muy sencilla, no es un juego para todos los públicos por ser algo complicado y largo en ocasiones.
Otro punto a favor es que la versión para 2 jugadpres es bastante aceptable, no como en otros juegos.

In one of the many Euro vs AT debates it was suggested that Euro games are characterized by structure and AT games by drama, and this game is all structure and no drama.  No surprise then, that this is the most polarizing game.

It's certainly mechanically sound, but it's entirely small, tough decisions that never develop into dramatic moments of agony.  Perhaps I just couldn't recognize the big moments, but this felt like death by paper cuts to me.  In Power Grid, for example, when a key plant comes up for bid, everybody knows that this is a huge moment in the game.  Caylus doesn't seem to have any moments like that, and that is perhaps the best generalized criticism of the Eurogames that I find dull.

I'd try it again though.

This is the newest game to my collection currently and lives up to its reputation based on only one play so far. I almost compare it to chess where each move is strategic and gives you some sort of long term benefit. Each "pawn" is vital and costs money to place so each placement needs to be placed with a lot of purpose. The game can be a little dry but the gameplay and strategy involved adds so much substance. There is no luck involved in this game so each placement, each resource gained, and each built item is based on skill and strategy. The game is very open, so players must make a plan and try to execute that plan more efficiently than the other player. I can see the potential for frustration because there are so many options to choose from, but that is why a plan is so important. Also, the first time I played with the wife we didn't use the provost as he should be used. I actually think it will be more fun with the provost because it will severely limit a player's plan and will create tension where there needs to be some tension. Provost is probably 50% of the strategy and without him, it is an incomplete game where players can do whatever they want by the end and what is the fun in that, except that it gets the wife to play.

One of the rising stars of heavy-weight "gamers" games, but I don't think I'm really a "heavy" gamer.  It is maybe too brain burning for my style, but I would like to try it some time just to see what the fuss is all about.

RATING: 9
Just like Twilight Struggle, I'm coming late to Caylus, and just like TS I see the brilliance of the design that everyone has been raving about. It's long, there's no getting around that because almost every placement of your workers is agonizingly difficult (in the best of ways). The depth requires that you have a plan and be patient enough to stick to it; no rushing to the castle willy nilly or just building things because you can. You need to plan ahead for 2 or 3 turn cycles so that your efforts are linked together effectively. It requires more discipline than most games and if you execute your plans it feels great; if not, you're flailing and just want the experience to end. 

If it were that simple it'd still be interesting but Caylus forces you to pay attention to tempo. The more you can stay out of tempo with your opponents as far as passing and going to the castle, the less resistance you'll encounter. Amid the great struggle of all these forces the game then intersects you by asking you to figure out if you should focus on building the castle, regular buildings, or prestige buildings. Absolutely agonizing. The way the buildings come out differently each game means no game should be quite the same.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Rating is from having only played this a few times, but I'm delighted with this game.  Much simpler than I was expecting, the complexity is in the number of options you have, not in the rules.  This may go up to a 10 depending on the duration of my enthusiasm.

It played very well with my wife, who is certainly not a hardcore gamer, and our first game landed square on the two hour mark.  Perfect.

Update:  The people I teach this to seem less enthralled with it than I, it might be part of my teaching process, but this has cooled my enthusiasm for the game a bit as it's hard to find repeat players.  Maybe my victory "my base in yo' face" dance is turning them off, too...

I want to like Caylus, but I don't. In addition to playing in person, I also have the app. I find the first few turns very exciting and taut with tension as people are accumulating resources for their first Big Thong. But after that, the game just gets too muddled for me. I feel like I need to play another half dozen times to really appreciate the strategy of the games. 

Basically, fun in theory, but not in practice. Could be good if it was my only game.

Great game. Cristina and I play this quite often as a 2-player and it plays just as hard. I believe it plays well with 2 to 4 players; at 5 players, the starting fifth player is somewhat "screwed" in resources and is forced into a "jockeying for first" strategy (although, to be fair I have won a couple games starting off as fifth).

Prefer Caylus Magna Carta because it's a bit more streamlined and I have a better chance of getting it to the table vs. Caylus.  Still respect this as a great game, but I prefer a shorter game which is less complex.  For worker placement I much prefer Agricola or Stone Age.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Changing from 9 to 8, just because the time investment to play value loses out vs. Agricola and other multiplayer role selection games. I think I've failed to master placement denial, and it's frustrating since the board evolves in unpredictable ways. The seasonal segmentation of available roles in Agricola helps bring down the variance to a manageable, interesting level.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Classic worker placement.  One of my all-time favorite games, especially with two players-- I like the control possible with fewer players and think 5 players is too chaotic.  I love worker placement games  and think Caylus is one of the more complex and interesting without the stressful aspect of Agricola.

RATING: 7.5
A worker placement game that is almost entirely pure strategy. Only the starting player order and initial tile placement is random, with all information out in the open for all to see. Takes a couple of games to grasp the mechanics and strategies.

Based on 2 plays.

> For those (like me) looking for a shorter but similar game, Pillars of the Earth is probably the best choice, albeit more luck-driven.
- Does not really get me. Dry.
- Someone said Caylus is too long for what it is. Now I know what they meant.
- Graphics quality is below average.

A jumbled mess.  While there are *a lot* of options in this game it just never feels very graceful. The beginning leaves you scraping to get resources together, the middle game hits a decent stride, but then it ends and it seems like one would hardly ever get to build all those expensive buildings available.  If it flowed better I'd like it better. Right now I can take it or leave it.

I thought I'd like this, based on the reasoning that anything the F:ATties hate this much can't be all bad, but holy crap is this game tedious.

Good game, finally knocked it off my want to play list. The rules reading was very heavy, lots of fiddly little conditions that make this strictly a gamer's game. You really do want to get this out and plough through it alone before playing. But for all that (and our initial mistakes), it plays out nicely. A VP engine, but you do have relevant choices and the turn order is significant. We played as 3 players, a slow start and a long burn. With 4 or 5, I can see it being faster and more competitive. Definitely want to play again, but still left feeling that it's not all that. Graphics are a bit gloomy and small.

Though I see this as a good design thus far it just hasn't sparked my interest.  It feels like there are too many micro decisions, as you have to use worker placement every round to gather tiny amounts of resources over and over again.  Perhaps this will still catch on down the road but thus far it's been a bore.

RATING: 7
After initially hating this game, I finally played through a full game.  The mechanic is fairly simple (go after resources and certain actions [like being able to build more buildings], then decide whether or not to continue paying workers to take actions, then resolve each building's ability [providing resources, allowing certain buildings to be built, building the castle], then score points, then repeat).  Seems like the game took too long and could have achieved its goal in a shorter time.  Also, it's strange that actually building the castle seems to generate far less points than building the ancillary buildings (such as the big 25 point building whose name escapes me).  It would seem since the overall theme behind the game is building the castle, it would follow that the game rewards players the most for actually doing that, when in reality the reward just comes from doing enough to not get penalized.

I'd play this again, but I don't think it's the game that everyone makes it out to be.  Could be because I've only made it through one game.  I am surprised that I liked this game.  Seems like it will go much faster after a couple of plays.  If it can get around an hour, I'd like it much more.

My non-gamer husband does not like figuring out the rules or the play.  I like it because I don't think it is complicated, and I like the flow of the game, an average play time which means we can play other games on game night. Have the Premium Limited Edition, $110 with shipping (perhaps these coins are real?).  

I am not sure I like the Premium version any better.  I think some of the tiles are harder to read and the board layout is very different (ugly & boring), and as the colors darker colors.  I like it that the first few basic tiles are not printed on the board, but can be arranged differently each game.

Oh my.  Finally discovered what all the fuss was about.  I agree with the favorable chatter around this magnificent game but it must be said that Caylus seems more like a highly successful blend of existing mechanics than some new groundbreaking game.  Everything works well together and the turn angst is atrocious (a very good thing in my book).  For veteran gamers, the game is picked up easily yet there are always new strategies you would like to explore.  Excellent in so many ways that for the genre I prefer it to Puerto Rico which is its closest sibling.  Plus, Caylus scales extremely well; I've played 2, 3 and 4 player games and each time the beautiful turn angst is ever present.

A tight game with a longer-than-I-like playtime and a wide variety of mechanics. With 18 months of Euro experience I'm much more capable of making sense of the interaction, collusion, racing, blocking, and leeching amongst all the actions.

It's reputed to be a very deep game, though the resource track is allegedly underpowered and I wonder if the prestige buildings and stone farms are too dominant (in that they are critical in every game).

The graphic design is easy to understand; despite complaints about abstraction, I feel things fit the theme quite neatly though the theme itself won't intrude. The translation of "donjon" as "dungeon" instead of "keep" is brain-dead.

I have this on iPhone.

After one face to face, two player game, I am hooked (I've gone over to BSW for several thrashings since then, but I don't log BSW plays). I love the way worker placement is played out. I may be wrong, but compared to, for instance, Agricola (a game I dislike) and Pillars of the Earth (a game I only sort of like), this seems to have more flexibility (at least in two player mode) for situations where the "good" choice gets nabbed by your opponent. I hope to play a good deal more of this one.

I've now played this game more than 10 times. It has grown on me even more. Great worker placement game, my favorite by quite a wide margin.

I really like this game, but there's too many things to min/max each round.  You've got to figure all your possibilities as well as others' but without really being able to make use of that knowledge in an interesting way.  Beyond trying to adapt a strategy around what buildings are being built, the game just ends up being a little too deterministic.  I like it best as a 2player for that reason I think since you have the minimum of calculations to make.

[Resource management, Special powers, Building] Played only on brettspielwelt.de, and I think that's going to be as far as it goes because Caylus is underdeveloped. It's slow, it's fiddly, it's repetitive and it's processional. That's pretty much fatal for a middleweight game of limited depth. [5P:3,4P:4/3,3P:4,2P:4] I've never liked resource swapping as a mechanism, and this game has it in spades. Just looking at all the resources flying around is almost enough to make my head explode. Game mechanism-wise, Caylus has nothing to write home about. Lacks polish. The game's heart is timing to grab buildings each turn, using them to generate resources and set collection on those resources so you can build stuff, with a dash of area majority based on the set collection. I would probably like the game more if it was executed better, but as it is, it's several tweaks away from being good. Dropped from wishlist. UPDATE: Played 4P F2F game. It's substantially WORSE than playing on BSW because of the bits and pieces. Caylus is almost in my "can't stand it" range, and one more F2F play will probably push it over the edge into Settlers and El Grande territory. Sigh. Ystari is the "new alea"? You have to be kidding me. alea's first four games were RA, Chinatown (never played), Taj Mahal and Princes of Florence. Ystari's first three offerings are nowhere near the quality of the three of those that I've played.Old comments: Geekbuddy rating is currently off the scale (13 ratings, 8.69, nothing lower than a 7 so far) but care needs to be taken especially since this is an indy game. My usually reliable buddies led me horribly astray twice (Reef Encounter, which is, to be kind, not good) and Power Grid (good game, not great, and certainly not an 8+ rating game). Watching and waiting for at least half of my Geekbuddies (30+ ratings) to weigh in. *** UPDATE: The low standard deviation (1.31) on Caylus is unusual for a game receiving this much hype. This means it's not likely to be a turkey (Happy Thanksgiving Americans!) but I'm still feeling this is a 6 or 7, along the lines of Power Grid (and agreeing with Siggins about gamers being 'excitable'). Now leaning towards getting the game, despite my serious misgivings. I can always trade it away I guess. *** WARNING SIGNS: The comments from Farrell are underscoring my fear of the indy design - just as Reef Encounter and Power Grid would be greatly improved by going through a rigorous development process where pruning extraneous mechanisms and playing time are the order of the day, so it applies to Caylus. For a 3H game (and that's likely to be the range for Caylus in my group) I'd rather bring Die Macher to the table. Even more cautiously approaching this one now. Has it been that long since an outstanding gamer's game has appeared that people forget the value of elegance and clean design? Still expect this to be in the 5 to 7 rating range for me... sadly.

This game is so great it makes other games I really enjoyed before seem only good.  I'm completely taken with it!  Don't worry about the length - even if it takes longer than some others, the time goes by quicker.

Así, a modo provisional tras jugar tres partidas. Tengo que jugar más veces, y puede que la nota baje o suba. De entrada es buen juego, pero ya veremos con el tiempo.

Tras jugar alguna partida más, corroboro que es buen juego. No se si mejor que agrícola o Puerto Rico, pero es seguramente más simple que ellos, y desde luego exige menos tiempo de colocación inicial, lo cual ya de por si le da muchos puntos.

Me pongo de pie y me pongo un traje. Juego elegante donde los haya, que te hace sufrir para ganar un mísero cubito y que cada punto se saborea como una grata recompensa. Mención especial merece la figura del preboste, que añade una interacción despiadada y cruel que le viene como anillo al dedo a esta maravilla. Una obra maestra atemporal. De los que me llevaría a una isla desierta.

Rating after initial play; uncertain about one or two aspects of play but there is certainly a lot of depth in this one.  Will it usurp PR as the gamer's game of choice?  Only time will tell...

UPDATE 23NOV05: Ugh!  This game is probably going down the same road E&T did for me.  It will take a while for the strategies to gel with this one.  Despite this I still don't think it is great, as the options seem to be limited for more players (i.e. 5 players).  Yes, I could be wrong, but the game just doesn't feel good enough for me to test my theory any time soon.  Rating dropped one place.

UPDATE 07JAN06:  Last night's play I tried a different approach; I now find different approaches do work but am still unconvinced the last player is not at a disadvantage.  Rating remains a 7, but now may rise.

RATING: 5
Probably better than Puerto Rico, but similar in that it is still a dry, proceduristic game of mechanics over theme.  Yes, you do a succession of actions to gain advantage(s) over other players, but there is little story to the process.  Whereas in something like Age of Steam, for instance, you still make decisions to advantage yourself over opponents, but you're also building your own railroad network in the process.

Played many times on iOS, but only a few in person. I love the "build a town" worker placement archetype. I haven't had enough time to dig into Le Havre (and after a few plays I suspect I'll ultimately like it more than Caylus), but one thing that strikes me about Caylus is that the decisions are somehow less intimidating despite the fact that the game is mathier and meaner than Le Havre. There's something about Le Havre's visual organization and free-form play that makes it feel more monolithic and impenetrable. Caylus is unforgiving and difficult, but it doesn't feel that way.

I like Caylus. Not enough plays to speak to long-term appeal, but it holds up to newer fare and I would rarely turn down a game.

RATING: 8.75
Caylus is a great strategy and resource allocation game.  I have played this game with my group, and more people enjoy this game than Agricola or Puerto Rico.  Some of the things I really enjoy about the game are the necessity for planning ahead, the way the game adds a level of uncertainty as to the resources you will end up harvesting, and the fact that at the end of the game most of the players are very close to each other in points.
The components are nice, the tiles and game board are sturdy, and the rules are very well written.  The only downside for some people might be that the game can seem somewhat cutthroat.

I can see this is a good game but I don't really enjoy playing it.  It takes too long, is very prone to AP lock, and the rules always trick me up (probably b/c I so seldom play).  However it is a good game with lots of player interaction, lots of interesting decisions, and multiple valid paths to victory.  Any game where you turn pink cubes into castle walls - fear my ham defenses! - is worth playing at least once.

Caylus is a good game (its mechanics works like a swiss clock, there is no doubt!) the problem is the feeling of playing an soulless game: that cold sensation like "no passion at all" that you can feel during the game. Of course, as always happens, this depends on the personal preferences of each one (for example, this means no problem to me, however to some playing groups this can be a disadvantage.

Nagyon sok idő után sikerült csak kipróbálnom. Mind a saját társasozós karrieremet, mind a megjelenést tekintve. Kicsit ódzkodtam is tőle, de így kellemes meglepetés lett belőle. Ez a játék több, mint 10 év után is simán megállja a helyét a mezőnyben. Mechanikailag. Designra nagyon elmarad a mai trendektől. Kifejezetten kellemesen hevi volt számomra. Talán egy kicsit túl sokat kell lélektelenül kalkulálgatni, de azért nem vészes, nem egy tzolkin. :) Sértődős társaságnak nagyon nem ajánlott, mert azért elég súlyosan ki lehet tolni a másikkal. teljes körök mehetnek a levesbe, egy-egy váratlan keresztebetevés miatt.

After the first play I'm a bit disappointed. It's not that Caylus is a bad game but after all I had read about it beforehand I had expected it to be "my game". Deeply strategic, no luck, sounded awesome. I suppose I didn't quite believe those who said it was a very dry game. Turns out they had a point, though. Mind you, it's still a good game even if it feels like 2 and a half hours of accounting at times.

William Attia ist ein freundlicher Mensch, der im Grunde für jeden Spielvorschlag erst einmal zu haben ist. Nur bei einem sagt er konsequent Nein: sein Jahrhundertwerk CAYLUS winkt er ab. Nein, das spielt er nicht. Ob es daran liegt, dass er vor lauter Testerei das Spiel zu oft vor sich hatte und es überdrüssig ist oder ob er dem eitlen Spieler-schlägt-Autor-Orden kein Material geben möchte, bleibt sein Geheimnis wie CAYLUS selbst: bahnbrechend, wegweisend und genreprägend sind nur einige der Attribute die dieses Werk verdient, das wie PUERTO RICO oder AGRICOLA eine ganze Generation Brettspiele beeinflusste und ihre Existenz erst möglich machte. Selbst heute, im Jahr 1500 nach Arbeitereinsatz umweht CAYLUS eine zeitlose Aura und steht in seiner besonders hässlichen Erstauflagenschachtel bescheiden und überdauernd als herausragendes Spiel in der eigenen Hall of Sammlung. Vogt und Seneschall sind bei ihrem Marsch auf der Straße des Glücks zu ikonischen, scheibenweißen Symbolen geworden. Und wer überholt jetzt wen? Man kann sich's einfach nicht merken. Der kunterbunte Kindergarten-Pastell-Look auf Leinwand, indem farbkompositorisch so rein gar nichts zusammen zu passen scheint ist Kunst. CAYLUS ist und bleibt Mutter von vielem, was danach kam. Ehre dem Schloß in der Höhe. Auch wenn es dem bescheidenen William gar nicht wichtig ist: er darf dort auf seinem Game of Throne gerne Platz nehmen.

Not for the faint of heart. Brutal and luckless, it can feel quite punishing when playing someone who really knows the game well.

Medium mind burner. Pretty fun even if you don't give it your all. Several pathways to victory. No actual die-roll type randomness except for the initial 8? tiles placement. But the player interaction introduces tense pseudorandomness. This game and Goa are two games that are about as good with 2 players as with more. Game length 2 to 2-3/4 hours.

RATING: 3
Doesn't do much for me. Too much to think about for my taste. It sucks out the fun out of a game. I was going to say that it was too heavy but I love other games arguably as heavy or more dry (Torres).

The game lacks laughter and surprises. Even Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence have more of those. And, at least, these last two play quicker. And this is perhaps my biggest complain. As the game progress it becomes slower and slower in pace. To the point of almost halting at the end where everyone tries to maximize its score. Intolerable!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
The theme fits in really well with all aspects of the game.  There are a myriad of choices to make, and unlike Puerto Rico, I understand the ramifications of all of them.  Being able to change the turn order is a nice concept.  The game does last about 2 hours longer than I prefer but it's still enjoyable.  Incredibly tactical, not so much strategical.

Caylus is a very smooth resource game, that is actually quite intricate without being overbearing.  Its got a great growth feel to it, with the village slowly evolving into a city.  There's always a multitude of decisions to make, with more and more developing with every turn.  Classic Euro, but thematically solid for the most part.  Lots of enjoyment comes from the interaction, blockage and constant holding-on for control.  Even after 10 years of Caylus it is deal one of the best worker placement games.

It's an interesting game, but it's just too complex for my tastes. I like the economic development as you go down the road, but I think I'd prefer a simpler game without the royal favours, the provost and even the castle. I don't understand why people like very complex games. I've played Caylus Magna Carta and it made me realise that Caylus really does have a load of crap in it. I passionately hate the provost, and would probably rate Caylus a 5 without it. I LOVE games where you develop economic systems, but I hate the JUNK that Caylus stuffs in with it.

Super worker placement game that's hard as hell, but very rewarding at the end where you see all the fancy new buildings you've managed to build and all the favors you've managed to get. Utterly merciless though, so maybe not good for strategic players who hate to see his/her plans dashed to bits.

Caylus, although highly praised here on the geek was a pleasant surprise.  I was afraid that Caylus would come across as being dry, I was wrong.  Caylus allows for a strong amount of player interactions, through both the mechanic introduced by the baliff and provost, and the necessity to generate wears using businesses owned by others.  The game has a wonderful balance between long term strategy and on-the-fly tactical decisions: as all plans can be stunted or made improbable by the smart play of others. The multiple ways of earning VPs makes each game seem fresh, and never leaving one parched.  From my few playings I feel Caylus is well deserving of it's high ranking. 

UPDATE:
Finding this one hard to get played.  After the initial honeymoon, although Caylus is still a strong title, it just come across a little dry.  Lowering to a seven.

UPDATE: Honeymoon is well over.  This ole gal was wearing on my nerves for a while and now she just bores me.

This is an enigine-building game in the mold of Goa and Puerto Rico - a "bits mangement" game with a limited strategic horizon (perhaps a 2-3 turn look-ahead) and a good number of interesting tactical choices every turn.  The player interaction does not take place through trading or auctions, but rather, on the board through unit placement and denial.

It's a fairly heavy game:  2-3 hours long with fairly complex rules and a lot of decisions.  Fiddly in a Puerto Rico sort of way.

If it wasn't so long and fiddly it would rate higher.  I find that I would rather play two different (shorter) games in the same amount of time.

RATING: 5
A very engrossing game for the experienced Euro gamer. It has a decent amount of player interaction. What I mean is that it is not a pure optimization of your own position (like Goa almost is) but you can do actions that will interfere with opponents plans.  There's nothing really nasty you can do (this is a Euro game after all) but it does add in a nice little "social" element that effects play.

The theme is weak, not that I expected anything more, but there is stuff to talk about after a game. That's a good sign.  It's a game I will not buy but definitly willing to play occasionally. I never expect to become that good at it either. 

In summary, I've seen it all the mechanics before but in Caylus it is all package together in the current grand poobah of Euro games.

RATING: 5
An amalgamation of good mechanics and pieces of many good games - put together to form a super game.  Like Barry Bonds on the juice, it's beefy, taking about 2 hours to play a 4 or 5 player game with experienced players.  Lots of opportunity for screwage, ample room for long-term strategy and requires clever balance of what you want to do versus preventing others from doing what they want.  I'm not sure it's the second-best board game ever, but an argument can be made for the top 10.

RATING: 7
Many options on each turn, and the best overall strategy is unclear. The royal favor system integrates into the game very well. Because scoring is done in a particular order, and resources gained early in the scoring round can be used later in the round, careful forethought is required to set up the best scoring opportunities.

Nice theme and bits.

I really like the design of Caylus, but for me the play time kills the fun.  My game group can't get through a game faster than 2.5 hours, and 3 hours is more typical.  2/3 of the way through, I'm ready to be done.  One could shorten the game, but only at the expense of losing the more interesting buildings.  I'd be happier just playing something else entirely, which is why I've lowered my score to a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Played a few times now and I really like this game!  For some reason I always feel like the castle scoring always comes a bit too soon for everyone's liking, but a little bit of discomfort is good in a game.  Can cause analysis paralysis in some cases.  Very tight with 5 players.

Generally, I want some luck in my boardgames.  I also am not big on the tactics-only games.  Chess comes to mind and is not fun.  However, Caylus offers many great strategic elements for all players and has virtually no luck.  I pick Caylus for a good competitive game without being too brutal on my competition.

It deserves it's place at the Pantheon of classic board games. The worker replacement mechanism is very balanced and gives a wide array of strategic possibilities.Unfortunately I can't convince a lot of people to play it, it is a bit dry indeed and the difficulty is not for many people.

I would definitely play this game if it was suggested to be put on to the table.

I feel so exhausted after a Caylus game and yet satisfied. After a few dozens of plays maybe you can plan a strategy and execute it. Before that time comes you just try to stay on the surface and admire other players who jump off with their every move. One of the best games I have ever played.

The only downside is the lenght of a play - it's impossible to tell in advance how long a game would take and it can be really long. But apart of that - a must-have for every eurogamer.

Fantastic game. I particularly appreciate the more direct interaction through the provost and the way the game integrates variability despite being luck free. The only issue is the game length which means it doesn't get played very often.

An excellent game with two main assets: several different (and good) ways of scoring points and a very nice flow of gameplay. Everything progresses smoothly and players see the results of their actions quickly (something I like in an optimization game). As a result, one tends to completely forget the passage of time when playing. Works also well with two players. Nice production value with a very effective use of symbols is also a bonus.

A 3p game took nearly 4 hrs - for 2 it was their first game but it had better come down to a more reasonable length.  Made it feel a bit repetitive in parts.  2008: hasn't got back to the table - too long is the consensus - so will try Caylus Magna Carta...

The best of the classic pastel euros. Excellent worker placement, resource management game with some very good player interaction in that you are jousling for that necessary resource or essential action each turn, and players are able to directly influence the pace of the game.

RATING: 10
My only ten so far. I've played the game in a variety of groups, and with two players. The game works surpassingly well with two, although it's much easier to recover from bad decisions.

I love the game's emergent strategy and almost complete lack of randomness. I also love that there are so many different ways to win, and that big-picture strategy and small but efficient victory point engines both have a place in this game. 

Each game is different, and even after multiple plays I feel like there is a lot to discover. There's so much to this game that not all of it will necessarily come out in a given play. There's so much subtlety that even a few creative moves can dramatically change the game.

This is a deep brain burner, and definitely not "lite" fare. I wouldn't pull this out when there are new gamers over or with non-geek family. However, I've been pleasantly surprised at how quickly less-experienced gamers pick this up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I am not sure what expectations I had going in.  There is a definite camp of people that worship at the altar of Caylus, and then there is the group that is suspicious of anything that popular, especially a game that rises up through the ratings so quickly.  I enjoyed the game, it was very engaging, and there are plenty of interesting choices to be made.  The game is a little daunting, and I am sure there will be internet Caylus sharks soon, just as there are internet Puerto Rico sharks.

I don't think the game is the second coming, but it is a good game and worthy of taking a look into if you like games of this type.  I look forward to trying it again, that is for sure.

Caylus as a fun game to play It's not that complex however the sequence of play in combination with all the options available makes it harder to fugure out what the ideal next action should be. 
It is quite a plus if you do not have to read through the rules. I can imagine that people tend to lay the game aside because of the rather long time it takes to master the rules.
The wide range of possibilities within the game, the game mechanics as the setting in which the game is designed makes it a feast to play.
Only remark could be the fact that the money counters are cheap.

Great game so go buy it!

RATING: 8
Amazingly enough, it lives up to its reputation. Two player game makes some things pointless, like the stables, passing order, etc, but still remains its tension nicely.

Rather a complex game to swallow, many things to keep track of during every phase of every turn, so the player-aids posted here on the 'geek where a great help keeping it going. It's actually rather surprising the game doesn't come with them.

My only real complaint is that it played a bit long for our tastes, but that could be adjusted by moving the scoring squares closer together, or such, so no big deal.

RATING: 8
Pros:
* Multiple paths to victory
* Lots of strategic and tactical play
* Lots of great mechanics
* Heavy on player interaction and screwage
* Perfect information, no luck
* Game feels different every play

Cons:
* Playtime can be too long depending on number and type of players


I think it's excellent with 3 players, very good with 2 or 4 pIayers, not enjoyable with 5 players. 

Playtime 
--------
30-45min per player. The game has a variable timer so you don't really know beforehand how long the game will be. The players and their strategies really dictate length here. And also, because of some really tricky decision-making some of your AP-prone players might extend the game. My games have always taken 40-45min per player, but with the right circumstances you could probably play this faster.

2 players
--------- 
Positives: A very nice head-to-head battle where you have a lot of control, both over your own destiny and that of your opponent's. It is easier to formulate a strategy and stick to it during the whole game, but there are still a bunch of tactical decisions to be made due to fierce competition and strong interaction. I would say that the strategy/tactics mix is something like 70/30 here.
Negatives: You are much less likely to be able to use the provost to mess up your opponents plans. There is no competition for player order because you simply switch who goes first every turn. 

3 Players
--------- 
Positives: You have to give up a little of your control but the added player interaction and tactics derived from that more than make up for it. I think the strategy/tactics mix is more like 50/50 with 3 players, and it is more satisfying because of it.
Both the provost and stables (player order) become much more interesting.
Negatives: I can't think of any, it's just great as a 3-player. The only problem is that I seldom have exactly 3 players.

4 Players
---------
Positives: Compared to the 2 player game, this has more interesting provost and stable play. Some other things like castle building, using the gate etc can also be more interesting than with only 2 players. 
Negatives: Strategy/tactics mix drops down to 30/70-ish. Gametime is more than I would like it to be. At least it has been for my group. 

5 Players
---------
Positives: Compared to playing with less players I don't really see any positive things. 
Negatives: Very little strategy left. I usually like tactical games (torres is one of my favourites), but I feel caylus really suffers from the lack of long-term planning. To me it feels more chaotic than tactical and I don't think it's fun for the long time it takes.

It's really funny how my approach to this title was changing. First I was too heavy for me and I prefered Caylus Manga Carta. Then I got Caylus and played it a few times and liked it. In the end I decided I would never love it. The design is clever, the game is deep, it's really a classic and acclaimed game. But... but really don't like one of it's features. Mainly that almost before every move you have to count how many cubes you and other players will have after executing all theirs actions. It's really tedious and makes the game feel dry. Besides, game rounds are rather repetitive.
To sum up, I respect Caylus, I can play it from time to time, but I don't have the desire to play it often and own it anymore.

Simplemente perfecto, cero azar (excepto decidir el jugador inicial de la primera ronda). Hay que estar familiarizado con las reglas para que sea equilibrado pero es muy bueno, nuestras partidas parecen partidas de ajedrez, todo está muy medido. Pienso que funciona perfectamente a 2 ó 3 jugadores, a 4 se vuelve un pelín caótico y cuesta mucho más plantear estrategias porque hay más jugadores a los que tener en cuenta. Nunca he jugado a 5 por la otra razón.

I suspect it plays best with 3 players, as it gives competition for spots, but doesn't just feel way too crowded.  2 seems like it would be odd, though doable.  5 is not something I'm interested in.

Edit:
I was wrong - 2 players is very good.  I think it's better with 1 or two more, but 2 players works very well.

Edit:
This game really rewards repeated plays.  Very simple to place people and collect resources, but lot of depth here.  After teaching it to two different groups, I do like that it is a deep game, but at the middle of the game, people seem to realize how to play and think "I'd like to give this another shot and think I can do a lot better".

It's a very strategic game (entirely so), but I've found it tends to fall into the 'if I do this then that on my first turn' type of game, where the strategy becomes very set after a number of plays.

While the game is good, once you play it a lot, the game gets a bit slow. A very good euro, if you're looking for something with a heavier gameplay value.

Often times I feel like my brain has drained out my ears after a couple hours of Caylus. Not my cup of tea (except maybe once or twice a month), but if you don't enjoy deep, deep strategy and trying to plan out your game 5 moves ahead, I might suggest you stay away from this one.

Another game that's just raved about on this site, but I can't bring myself to enjoy. I bought it based on the rave reviews here, and found it to be another euro-yawn-fest. Not my thing.

Caylus is an excellent worker placement game. I thoroughly loved the first go through of the game. A lot of strategic options. We played two player, but I imagine it would have a lot more strategy with more people. It does take a long time to complete.

A very interesting game of strategy and planning, which surprisingly has few decisions that cause analysis paralysis (perhaps because most of the planning decisions are broken up into bite-size chunks). In the first edition it was difficult to tell the denominations of coins apart, but that was fixed in later editions.

This was one of my Must have games.  I got it for xmas the year it came out and was so happy about it.  Haven't even removed the shrink.  I have played a hand full of times with friends and rather enjoyed the game.  Not exactly sure why I haven't played my copy yet.  I think 'new game' syndrome is the reason.  There are so many new games to try, why play one I already know.  Okay broke this out after playing 6 rounds of Agricola and I have to say my love for this game has been renewed.  I love the non-random nature of this.  Amazing game.

My first impressions of Caylus were mixed but mostly positive:  "The tactical decisions of prioritizing and timing the deployment of my workers are interesting.  The game gives you always something to think about and always something to do.  The mechanisms are well-conceived and fit together seamlessly.  My favorite part of Caylus is anticipating and manipulating the power games, guesswork, and shifting alliances surrounding the provost's movement."

However, each time I play Caylus I like it a bit less.  That's not a good sign.  It seems to lack a few of the qualities that a game of this length needs in order to have staying power.  (1) The game decisions are probably about 90% tactical, dominated by short-term prioritization, and thus there is very little opportunity to pursue truly distinct strategic paths.  That's acceptable for a 60-80 minute game, but it's a poor texture for a game that stretches on for two to three times that length. (2) A game of this length needs to have more of a shape.  The game should change from beginning to middle to end.  In Caylus, you're mostly just doing the same things over and over for two or three hours.  Not every turn is the same, of course, but there is this sort of constant ebb and flow that looks the same throughout the game.  There's no story arc, just lather, rinse, repeat.  Try writing a session report and you'll see what I mean. (3) A game this long needs to behave differently each time you play.  Caylus games vary a little bit, but not enough to feel like I'm seeing anything new from game to game.

I think that part of the problem resides in the way that the various buildings and projects are shared among all players.  Because of this, there's no real differentiation among the players, other than their respective positions on the king's favor tracks.  Everything else sort of blurs together, and since everyone has the same opportunities, all the decisions involve seizing short-term opportunities.  My position on turn X will look pretty similar to your position on some other turn Y.  Whichever one of us optimizes all our little decisions better will probably win.  That's fun for a few games, but it's not the sign of a deep game nor is it the sign of a highly replayable game.  Caylus: reasonably fun for now, won't hold up over time, not as deep as it appears, doesn't offer quite enough punch for its length.

[Update] I traded away my copy after a few plays, and have had no desire to revisit the game.

I might be in opposition here, but I like this game more now than I did when it got out. When it got out I thought it was novel and neat game, but pretty dry and brain burning. The fact that it is a perfect information game (a type of game I normally despise) didn’t make it better. The game might look hard to understand, but it really isn’t that hard because it has sequential phases. It is a highly interactive game, but you have to form your strategy still.

Many gamers have problem with the time it takes to play. I don’t have a problem with that since I found it pretty involving from the first turn. Sometimes the last two turns can seem little automatic, but better that than feeling that the game ends too early.

I found it play good with any number of players, but I prefer to play it with 3 or 4 players. I am a social gamer, so that might be the reason I don’t play this as a 2-player game. I think I am done with five player Caylus. There is just damn too much chaos in the game for that.

I have played more than 1070 game of Caylus on BrettspielWelt.
I have played mostly 2 player game (over 1000) and to me this is the best way to play Caylus.  I have played so many 2 player game that it's a bit frustrating for me to play with more player (especially 4 or 5) because I don't have the same control.
If you haven't play too much 2 player game like I did, Caylus is a great 3 player game.

(Rating after min. 12 plays with different # of players)
After the bailiff prevented me in my first game gaining 4 resource cubes I also couldn't build my part at the castle and therefore lost some victory points as punishment in this scoring round. I lost my third place and was last one with ten points down to the fourth place (after a third of the game). 
In most games you are not able to catch up such a set-back because of its limited mechanisms. But in Caylus I was able to catch up and finish as third of five players.
I am impressed by the abundance of choices to be made without being a overly complex game.

Played 20+ 2,3,4&5 player. I like it equally with any number of players. I can't remember ever feeling so good about a game just from looking at the board and bits and reading the rules. I have only played with two players and it plays fine with just 2. I can only imagine that with more players the game would be even better. This feels like a fantastic 90 minute game to rival PR, Princes of Florence and Amun Re. Despite the game length there is a nice quick pace to the play. *UPDATE* played twice with 2 different groups of 4 gamers and the estimate of 40 mins per player seems accurate, I suspect we can get that down to 30 mins with experience. I can't get this game out of my mind. *UPDATE* This is still the game for me 6 months and 10 games after purchase. We keep finding new ways to play and usually the winner is not apparent until the end of the final turn. April 06

RATING: 8
Outstanding game, notwithstanding the required commitment in playing time (which is considerable, especially with players who haven't played it before).

When it came out, it was often compared to Puerto Rico (another wonderful game) in terms of level of enjoyment and "game design quality". Personally, I would vote for Puerto Rico between the two due to the game's ingenious mix and balance of strategic and tactical elements (in Caylus, I find that resource management becomes very strategic at the expense of tactical considerations towards the end, requiring extensive "counting" several game turns ahead to figure out where to place one's workers in order to gain the optimal combination of resources enabling the necessary purchases and actions). But Caylus might be slightly better "balanced" between the various choices available to a player than Puerto Rico.

Excellent. It's the sort of game that you can play pretty intuitively, or spend aeons thinking about - hopefully, the players will find a mutually acceptable pace. A lot simpler than it first looks (learning what the buildings do is the only difficult part, and that's easier than first appears). Anyway, it's a deep game with appealing components, and good pacing. It's hard to make it sound exciting, but Caylus is a lot more than the sum of its parts - just lots of well-tuned systems working together to make a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Apart from the intial decision on play order, no luck factors can be discerned as action and tiles are available to all players from the get go. This, in my opinion, helps make Caylus one of the best worker placement games out there

RATING: 10
Outstanding! Almost no randomness to this game other than placement of first few resource/action tiles. Player politics will come into play in this game as the provost controller can make or break some very big plays depending on his decision to allow or disallow the triggering of action/resource tiles further down the path. Care must be taken in knowing when you will collect your resources and when actions that require your resources will trigger as everything occurs in the specific order of the path.

This is my favorite "Euro" game, more complex than Puerto Rico while still keeping a small set of rules. The theme is a perfect match for the mechanics, which include resource management, building economic engines, and even a rudimentary "area control" viz. the Provost. The available decisions are many, the strategies are myriad, and the game makes you want to try again and again. Caylus deserves it's reputation as a classic.

Cool game.  It's definitely a game where there are a ton of different strategies that work.  Strategies that seem critical at first can turn out to not be necessary, and things you overlooked the first couple games can become essential.  If you don't like how things are working you can try something totally different, and as long as you play it well, that will work too.  The biggest problem is that it seems that most of the time, the game is decided by the halfway point, and after that it's a race to see how badly you can trounce the other players.

I can definitely see why this one has garnered such hype. It seems complicated at first, but everything quickly falls into place and interacts quite well. There are many variables that will make this one different every time and increase replayability. Finally got to play it with 5. I liked it quite a bit. Yes, it was a long game, but it didn't feel long while playing. It's a little tough on new players if they're not paying attention, since there are so many actions and buildings to keep track of.

Caylus is a very good game.  Similar to Agricola with worker placement, but a very different theme and mechanics.  Strategy is not so cut and dried as with Settlers of Catan or Agricola (where the cards direct your strategy more). In this respect it is more like Puerto Rico where you need to decide the best line of play as you go.

Firstly one little issue I have with the game - the money is terrible! Seriously, there have been plenty of discussions on money in games and I would have thought they could have come up with something better than tiddly winks! Not only that, the 5s are the same colour as the 1s. Not good enough.
That is my only complaint with the game thus far though. I've played a 5 player game where I finished 4th and a 4 player game where I finished 3rd. Both times I really enjoyed the experience of playing and was hankering after another game of it immediately. Money aside this game has a very good 'bits' value (ok so the cubes are a little small but they don't need to be big). The actually rules are quite simple - You place a worker, the next player places a worker, etc. then resolve all buildings in order. What I like is that there are lots of choices each turn for where to put your workers and what sort of strategy to go for. It seems like it will be intimidating to teach to some of my friends because there are lots of fiddly things to explain (what each building does, what royal favours are, etc.) but hopefully once they've played a game or two it won't seem quite so difficult and they will enjoy it as much as I have.

Edit: I only have the 1st edition and the 2nd edition doesn't have the above mentioned problem with the money.

Like Puerto Rico, without turn order, which to me is a bonus.  Still plenty of screwage, but it feels less random then PR, which is good. It seems there may be more paths to victory too.  I like it better, but its still just a move optimizing game with little player inaction, until that one great screwage of another player that ruins their plan, and wins you the game.  Still not really my type of game.

Rating after one play is hardly fair, but holy crap!  I'm so happy I got this game!  It really makes Agricola feel like a long difficult struggle because in Caylus, you're deciding which awesome thing to do each turn (still a tough decision!) and in Agricola your decisions are based simply on tiny steps forward, and mostly about survival.  I'm excited to try this game with more than 2 players and I'm really happy I got the deluxe edition of this game if only because I feel like the redesigned artwork is way better and I love the minted coins!

Tried this with 4, and it does add some new challenges.  In a two player game, you can make your choices by thinking, "If they take that action, I'll just take this one instead."  With more players the ability to get great action combinations suffers, but the game certainly does not.

Loses a few points for lack of accessibility and stunningly awful box art.  Otherwise a great brain-burning game for 2-4 players.  One of the best 3 player euros on the market, which fills a gap in my collection.  Probably the most challenging worker placement game available.  Many mechanics, but all of them feel like tools at a player's disposal rather than devices to direct the players.  Most tense with three players due to increased provost interaction, most controlled with two.

The strategic decisions in this game are challenging and exciting. Great production quality, and after one play it's easy to get on the table again and set up.

However, it doesn't get many plays because of the game length. We like to keep family games under an hour, and this one is always clocking in at 90+ minutes. Takes up an entire afternoon or evening, and that's not a plus for the game groups we play with.

Heavy and demanding but once you focus on playing itself rather than on winning the game and analyzing what the best move is, the game itself can be a lot of fun.

Number of paths to achieve victory, very high replayability, wonderful game for 2p and 3p as well, though the latter variant demands different approach. One of the best games in the world, a place in first ten on BGG is well deserved.

22nd August 2009: I am updating my rates so that they would be in compliance with BGG suggetions. Rate down to 8 from 9.

pretty much disliked everything about this game.  you make a poor move, you lose (3 hours later).  you've played more than everyone else, you win.

the theme is minimal, it takes a long time to play, and many of the choices are not actually useful.

don't ever want to play it again.

Super tight worker placement game. Played this quite a bit in college - it definitely works best when you've got a group of players of roughly equal skill level. Individual turns go quickly and the game doesn't overstay its welcome, while presenting pretty deep tactical [individual placements] and strategic [which VP sources to go for] choices.

Me parece un muy buen juego, en el que tienes que poner todos tus sentidos para intentar ganar, no te da tiempos muertos, y hace que estes pensando todo el tiempo. Hay muchas cosas por hacer lo que hace que pienses en varias cosas en cada jugada, y permite interactuar con tus rivales lo que permite un buen nivel de competitividad, es de los mejores que he jugado.

I think Caylus is a good game, in that every player need put all their senses for try win. Don't exist dead time, it does think all time. In Caylus exists a great interactivity among the rivals, that creates a high level of competitivity. It's one of the better game I have played.

Nálam nem el&#337;zte meg PR-t.
Érzésem szerint er&#337;s taktikai lehet&#337;ségei nem párosulnak er&#337;s stratégiai lehet&#337;ségekkel. (Nem úgy a PR-ban.) Nehéznek t&#369;nik tervezni, vagy inkább terveinket végrehajtani. A játék f&#337; eleme a munkásaink feladattal ellátása. Itt pedig ellenfeleink alaposan beleköphetnek levesünkbe. Egyrészt pillanatok alatt borulhatnak terveink, s így meglehet&#337;st kaotikus a dolog, más oldalról nézve viszont folyton dinamikusan változtatni kell elképzeléseinken.
Egyel&#337;re így látom egy és kétszer fél játék után. Ez alapján még nem pontozom le, de 9-10 között érzem a leend&#337; eredményt.

Plusz egy parti után döntöttem a 8-as érték mellett. Eddig 3-4 f&#337;vel próbáltuk, most egy 5-f&#337;s játék meger&#337;sítette bennem az eddigieket. Azon játékokhoz viszonyítva, melyekre 9-et adtam, erre per pillanat csak ennyi tellett. Hosszadalmasan el&#337;adható szabályrendszere után kissé hosszú és tán kissé vontatott játék következik. Hiányzik a parti közbeni egyéni fejl&#337;dés érzése, ami megvan a PR-ban, s&#337;t még a Catanban is. Ami persze kapcsolódik a játékos stratégiai elképzeléseihez.
Kiváncsi vagyok még arra, hogy milyen lesz 2 f&#337;vel.

This is another I passed over for too long and am now thoroughly enjoying playing. There's an appealing simplicity to the game that hides some great tactical and strategic depth and after a few plays you can really feel you're only scratching the surface. The placing workers along the road to be later used in order is a great mechanism, while the threat of the provost (a piece players can move along the road) making you not get to take some of your actions adds that required tension level.

4/16/07 update:  After playing Pillars of the Earth, would prefer that over Caylus (they are similar, though different in some respects)

The next PR? I don't think so.

haveing played quite a few games it seems to me that the game is the sum of a lot of really marginal decisions and it is actually quite difficult to make long term plans. I am not sure if there are distinct strategies, it just seems like most people are trying to do the same stuff at slightly different times. I am still happy to play but I am not even convinced this is the best game of 2005 let alone the 2nd best game ever.

Several plays later and yes, it is a clever game but it just leaves me cold. I don't feel that there is much in the way of coherent strategy there. I just seem to jump from short term goal to short term goal.

Played twice now on BSW.  Its harsh to judge a game without playing face to face, especially when I could be missing some of the rules, but I think a lot of the criticisms of this are on the money.  Its not very strategic, with more of the decisions being tactical in nature.  It also doesn't change much throughout the game... the last half hour doesn't feel that different from the first half hour.  The "theme" is a complete turnoff. I will update my rating if I ever play it FtF.

As worker placement games go, I prefer Agricola (the cards add a lot) or Pillars of the Earth (same feel, but much simpler and shorter). The fact that there is no randomness at all makes this feel a bit too puzzle-y for my taste. In spite of the amount of player interaction (a lot), you're main goal is still to optimize every action, not really to respond tactically to the players or the game situation. Nevertheless, it's a well-crafted game and I can understand why people like the deep experience it offers.

I've only played about 5 times, and I still don't get how to win this game.  There are a lot of complexities -- you have to understand all the buildings very well, and try to build the right one given the game circumstance that you find yourself.  With a game like this (with no randomness other than the initial turn order and pink tile layout), you have to read the mood of the group.  If people are paying a lot of money for moving the provost each turn, you have to keep some money in reserve (and perhaps advance on the money royal favours track).  If the lawyer comes out late, you should probably be working on the building royal favours track.  All in all, I need to play this game at least 5 more times to gain an appreciation for it.

A game I'll play if offered but not suggest myself. Another extremely well designed 'gamey' Euro involving shuffling stuff around in creative combinations. Not enough oppurtunities for conflict/co-operation to make it exciting for me much like Goa, PR and PoF in that respect.

RATING: 6
Undoubtedly, this is the game that I hate the most and yet will still play. I hate others more, but I will not play them, so they don't count. The problem I have with this game is that I have yet to see a solution for the stone production buildings (the person placing the worker gets three resources, the owner gets one plus the VP). Every game I've played of this is dominated more by deciding what the hell to do about these buildings than it has been about actual victory. This is a game that desperately wants to be good, but as far as I am concerned, can't be.

Easy to play but not so easy to master.   

Everything you need to know about the game is right on the board or on the tiles, so there is little need for player aids (although newbies should use them).

You will always have more things you'd like to do than you have resources, so resource management is the key to everything.

The money (denier) coins are too thin/small and should be replaced by poker chips.

Caylus has a lot going for it, but the Provost movement is worrisome. The rules seem to encourage players to coerce each other into making movements beneficial to them, yet no actual deals can be made, opening the door to back-stabbing and other threats. Worst of all you have to figure out your own best move while your opponents are lobbying for you to do what they want. This seems very out of place in this otherwise nonpolitical game. I am told that without this unpleasantness, the Provost mechanic doesn't work, but I haven't played enough to decide if this is true or not. The game's other major flaw is its length... it is a long game, and may be made worse by overly analytical players.

Nice game but not sure about it's replayablity. I've heard it's better with two but haven't tried that yet. One in our group says it doesn't have the sense of advancement that say Puerto Rico has and I have to agree with that. Nicest upgrade is a building that you build will pay you resources if someone chooses to use it's technology (or whatever you want to call it). King's favor on the other hand has a lot going on and maybe too much power in the one track that lets you build certain buildings even if the upgrade to build them has not been built. Oh well, I'd like to play more to see.

RATING: 9
Tonight I was able to simplify gameplay for a new player who seemed overwhelmed by all the choices in Caylus.  "Gather stuff; build stuff; get money; get favors," I told him.  This is a gamer's game in that the new player is not likely to luck into a first time win, as he didn't in my game.  Like Puerto Rico it has several somewhat standard moves - which puts off some people.  But Caylus has a lot more variability and ebb & flow than PR, and if you enjoy it enough you'll play several times to improve your strategy and try different things.  No apologies from me for enjoying this one.

[Initial Impression: 9]
A gorgeous game with a large amount of information to take in, accompanied by strategic variety.  I especially like the mechanics of being able to use an action to influence turn order (the Stables) or to immunize yourself against increasing costs late in a turn (the Inn).  You are constantly left feeling that someone just took the action you wanted, but there is usually another available that you can use to your benefit.  Sessions (especially with new players or a high player count) can be quite long (2.5-3.5 hours) and at times feel overly mechanical, as there are many moving parts and maintenance steps to track during each turn.  The playing time doesn't bother me, however, and seems to fly by, as I'm utterly absorbed throughout each game. 

As I continue to play this, I've become even more enamored with it. Although some complain about the "chaos" in a 5-player game, I think this is much ado about nothing. I like the 5-player version enormously. Resources are much tighter with more players, you really have to fight for favors, and the so-called "chaos" is simply the result of having to account for the interactions of multiple players.  Each player's choices are almost always predictable according to their strategy (which you can infer from prior choices), and you simply have to keep a set of back-up choices in mind and adapt your strategy to take advantage of what others are undervaluing. I believe that those with complaints about chaos are mostly upset that they can't easily carry out their favorite strategy.  It is also a very good 2-player game, but the fluidity of the changing turn order and the value of the Inn are diminished.  With just 2 players, it can become quite nasty, as moving the provost loses all of its cooperative aspect, becoming a struggle to help solely yourself or to harm your sole opponent.

Grumpy looking guy on cover; old-fashioned Euro-cubes in an unattractive mix; basic decent art; and a place in the top 10.

Eventually it all piqued my interest, and I obtained and played Caylus. Wow, was it worth it!

This is a terrific player-determined strategy game, with many little swings and controls, and it rewards those who act wisely.

I wish I hadn't waited so long to try Caylus- it's about as good as advertised at what it does (and that is very good). Based on a solo 3-player game I'm starting this at 7.5, with room to move upwards.

Pure strategy euro worker placement game . 

It took a couple of plays to get into this but once you learn the mechanics, it's a incredibly straight forward game with a high degree of planning and skill needed to win.

This game also has a lot of interaction between players and game to game can be incredibly varied in terms of game length and type of play.

There is a reason this game is so highly rated, and it's because it's that good.

Update: Increased this to an 8 after playing a tense two player game. All my previous games were with 4+ - I suspect that this game will seriously shine with 2 or 3 players, and will avoid higher player counts in future.

I prefer to play Caylus with no more than 3 people. People who complain about the game lacking "interaction" are definitely not playing the provost correctly, imo.

Horrible as a gateway game though--this game can be punishing to those who fall behind early, and it is easy to fall behind early if you don't know what you're doing.

This is a solid game, but I wonder about the game's lastability: Just like in Puerto Rico, it seems that a good chunk of the game can become scripted.

I liked this, could see it deserved a 6.5 or 7... but more than that? I need another play or 2

2 Plays later its an 8... tempted to buy this too, becoming a favourite worker placement

---

Bought it, play the app loads and on BGA and now I'm an addict. This is brilliant. Best with 2-3 though it's also a very different game when played with 2p vs multiplayer. The fan made soloplay rules are not bad either, though I think I'd still rather play the app if I'm stuck on my own

RATING: 7
Meeple placement strategy game. Rather heavy.
Purple, brown, grey, gold resources. 
Brown, grey buildings. Green, blue ones to replace others (cut the the excess of available resource buildings). 
Construction on the snake-looking progress path.
Thin and fat white guys moving along the snake.
Prestige grid. Points ribbon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.7
A very deep construction game with strange but enjoyable mechanics. The theme is rubbish, but for me that does not bring the game down in fun. There is opportunity to be very nasty and to get mega powerful buildings in your favor. Caylus' rank should be much higher than what it is. A game that will *hopefully* live on for a long time.

This is another Ystari published design, along with Ysaphan. I just don't get Caylus. Maybe I do, but the memory of my first (and possibly last) game was too painful, that I don't want to touch this again. I felt the same about Puerto Rico, so maybe I just have to buy this and read the rules and play the damn thing. It's unquestionably a watershed design: complex, intricate, and fascinating. However, it's as painful as playing Age of Steam, if I recall. Too much move optimization. Maybe that's why I don't fondly remember this game.

Update (05/30/12): With Lords of Waterdeep offering me the same kind of play for less pain, why would I ever want to play this again? Perhaps when I eventually grow tired of LoW's simplicity, I will seek this out. But not today, not this week, or this month. Down to a '5'.

I've played this twice now. Sure there are lot's of choices, but none of them seem very appealing. Each choice is so very hedged by something else that someone may do the strategies that DO present themselves are slight, not very appealing and may change several times before your very next turn. No K-O, Caylus is a game of attrition.

This game is headache inducing. I can see why it is considered such a good game, but in the end it just feels like work. Stressful work.

After one play - really like this a lot and would love to play it again... difficult to teach to new people so doesn't come up very often.  This could be replaced by Agricola as my worker-placement game of choice, but I like the concept of "owning" a building and receiving benefits when someone uses it.  It adds an extra layer of strategy as to which ones to build early vs. later.

RATING: 7
I don't really know what to think about this game as of yet, I haven't played it enough to make a statement really. I find it a bit overrated compared to, say, Puerto Rico, because it is much harder to get an overview of what is happening when you don't know the game intimately.

Outstanding game. The original design however is not great, but that doesn't change  how great this game is in regards to game play. Would love to have the special edition!   I have played the game twice FTF now and about 27 times on BSW. This game is simply amazing. I won my first FTF game last night by 1point (at 61VPs) with 2nd place being a tie at 60VPs. No one strategy will win! And the variety of options in the game keep it interesting. 

The more I play this, the more I love it.

Good but dry. Very tactical rather than strategic. By which I mean there is no long term plan worth having (game position and other players mess any of those up)but a short term horizon of what I can do this turn and set up for the next. 

Scales very well though with number of players although the game changes a lot depending on number of players.

Having played over 80 games of Caylus, I can write that this is one of the most incredible games I've every played.  The depth of the game is astounding.  There are so many different paths to victory.  There is so much going on, that it is mind boggling.  There is NO luck at all in Caylus (except for initial turn order.)  All information is open to everyone.  Most importantly, this game is FUN!!!  Now for one negative:  The rule book is absolutely the worst I have ever encountered.  It took me days of reading it multiple times and then reading explanations at BGG, until I finally understood all aspects of the game and felt confident to teach it and play it.  It is a shame that the rules were written so poorly because the game is really not that difficult.  (The depth comes in the strategy.)  My first game, I played with two 12 year olds and after my explanation, they understood the game completely and played well.  We only made one error in playing, which we caught before the end of the game.  Ystari needs to do a complete re-write of the rule book (scrap the old one and start over) because the game is awesome - very engaging and challenging.  I can't imagine that anyone but die-hard gamers would go through what I did to learn and play this great game from the rule book.  The game runs long, but picks up a lot after several plays.  I enjoy a longer game anyway, so that isn't a negative for me.  There are just so many choices and the game is prone to AP.  I'm playing a two player game now in about 1 1/4 hours.  I'm always looking for a great two player game and Caylus plays superbly with two.  In fact, it might be best with two, since the provost is always in play and a real factor in the game with two players.  A perfect "10". . . . I just played this game again recently after a long break and I must say that this is a truly great game - one of the best I've ever played.  It holds up very well and is very very intense (in a deliciously fun way).

Magnífico juego de fuerte interacción entre jugadores. Permite distintas estrategias. La tensión va en aumento conforme avanza la partida.

Excellent heavy Euro game.  Many call it the best since Puerto Rico, which I'd agree with if I didn't like Caylus even better then PR.  Regardless of your opinion on that controversial matter, any fan of heavier Euro games should give Caylus a look.  Oh, and it plays well with three, four and five players, with different approaches required for each number.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Like Puerto Rico, Caylus has almost no random elements.  In fact, all of the random elements are decided at the start of the game, so there won't be any surprises as the game goes on.  I like how many different paths there are to victory and the variety of choices you need to make during the game.  Not a light game by any means, though, so gaming newbies are advised to start elsewhere and work their way up to Caylus.

A clever re-distillation of mechanisms that started a craze for 'worker placement' games. Caylus has lots of ways to score, even a little non-binding negotiation. For a while after launch this was among my favourite games, but the fact that buildings are added to a common pool rather than being 'yours' makes this game highly vulnerable to groupthink. My group tends to emphasise cube taking and so adds those buildings that produce double cubes, while few are interested in haggling over moving the provost, which reduces the game to an unexciting minimum. For me, this is the classic star that burned brightly, but was soon gone, and is one of the few games that can be said to have started a genre, but Agricola has now completely stolen its thunder.

Random placement of starting tileset (pinks) defeat standard openings!  Very good interaction amongst players and many hard descisions to make.  Should probably play with a turn timer if you have one as this one does lead to analysis paralysis

Perhaps a good game in its day, but that age has long since passed.  Its an ok action selection and resource management game.  The player interaction comes in the form of lopsided action blocking and take-that.  Usually to the determent of both the player getting blocked and the player blocking.  The game can be completely destroyed by one weaker player.  There are also unbalances in strategies as the game is nowhere as close to open as it pretends to be.  Furthermore, there are mathematical imbalances based on player turn order that are haphazardly compensated for. Ive played the game a significant number of times and I have won the game against good players in a completely unfulfilling fashion and I see absolutely no reason to ever play again.  If this game is in your Top 100 it is most likely because you havent played 101 games yet.

It's a good game, and probably deserves a lot more plays, but somehow it just doesn't have the draw of other games with 5 players.

It's not particularly complex, but it's difficult to play again after a gap of 3 or 4 months.  It feels like you're always re-inventing the wheel, rather than developing the next Ferrari.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: Caylus is a nasty, nasty game. First you think it is easy, because there are not that many rules and you can grasp it fairly easily. But then the game starts and you realize how deep it actually is. And then someone moves the provost or places a worker on a spot you really needed and you've practically lost instantly.

Positive points:
- Simple and few rules but still deep and complex gameplay
- Doesn't take too long
- Great implementation of the worker placement mechanic

Downsides:
- Very unforgiving. There is now catch-up mechanism if you've fallen behind.
- Very nasty: other players can screw your plans so much that you really have to hold your temper.
- Dry theme

My summary: I like it, but I won't play it that often. I don't feel it has been replaced by the newer games.

Juego de información perfecta  más interactivo y más intuitivo que otros dos grandes eurogames (Puerto Rico, Power Grid) con más formas de ganar que en ellos. Tiene todo lo que me gusta en un eurogame de este estilo: gestión de recursos (trabajadores, dinero, bienes), edificación incrementada (los nuevos edificios son más podersos progresivamente), “draft” (eliges la prioridad de lo que quieres conseguir), estrategia (planificación a largo plazo), táctica (aprovechar oportunidades), sin azar (tan sólo el orden en el que aparecen los primeros elementos), diferentes maneras de conseguir puntos (y por lo tanto, de ganar), excelente equilibrio entre los distintos estilos de juego. Las decisiones a tomar parecen simples, aunque en realidad no lo son (debes elegir sólo una de las múltiples opciones considerando la ganancia inmediata, pero pensando en los efectos a largo plazo). Tres es el número optimo de jugadores PEGAS: Sólo para jugones,  (para novatos recomiendo Agricola o Age of Empires III). Downtime con jugadores con excesivo A/P, excesiva dependencia de lo que hagan los demás,  en el juego a 5 jugadores.

As much as I'd love to like this game, it's just too long and involved.  There are way too many things to do on each turn, and while the decisions all seem important, a lot of them are very similar.  So there's a lot of analysis paralysis without the benefit of satisfaction of having won the game.

There are good opportunities to screw your opponents over in various fiddly tactical ways, but none of them are satisfying even remotely as much as El Grande for example.

Gioco di posizionamento con prenotazione anticipata delle “azioni future”, è uno dei maggiori successi degli ultimi anni. Complesso e profondo, è un gioco caratterizzato da continui dilemmi dove, a giro, si operano svariate scelte che vanno a ridurre quelle a disposizione degli avversari. Con il raffinato meccanismo del “balivo” e del “prevosto”, si può persino accorciare o allungare la durata della partita.

Caylus, what a great game I hardly ever play.  Reason being it is just too damned heavy and brain burning.  My causal gaming friends cringe at the thought of seeing it at the table.

Would prolly rate higher if anyone wanted to play it with me.

Fantastic zero-luck game.  May 2017 downgraded to 8 from 10.  I still love it, but after 30+ plays you tend to see the same strategies happening a lot.  Still a great game, and one that I love seeing hit the table.

It took almost a year to get Caylus played, but we really enjoyed it. To my surprise, Brooke immediately said "this one's a thumbs up" after the game was over. Well, I could tell she was enjoying it while playing. But going in, I didn't expect her to go nuts for it. I like Caylus a _lot_ more than Agricola, which is I think the closest I've got to Caylus in my collection.

This game is the ultimate dry Euro; luck has been virtually removed from the game, so it is almost chess-like in that regard.  I like the theme and the artwork on the board and tiles.  Caylus plays very similarly to Tzolk'in where players are rewarded or punished on the merits of their ability to plan a few moves ahead and to make groups of series of actions in just the right sequence so as to maximize the output of their workers.  Caylus is a very thought intensive worker placement joint, deserving of its cult following. I think it's important to mention that Caylus is very punishing of poor play, particularly in the early going, just like Tzolk'in.  It can be extremely challenging to eke your way back into contention if you fall behind the other players.

The initial description of the rules left my wife wondering what she was in for. The 1st couple of turns were kind of rough because there is a lot you can do and as new players we were not sure what to do.

By the end of the game everybody was pursuing their own strategies and having a good time. 

Good game and we look forward to playing again.

I must admit, as a caveat, that I don't necessarily have a huge predilection toward "heavy" Euro games.  With that said, I felt the game was really dry and not a terrible amount of fun.  While I can respect the design for its numerous interlocking mechanics and variables, the game is more analogous to a math equation that everyone plays more or less solitaire (yet is scored competitively).  The whole time I played, I was wishing for some kind of peasant battle resolution.  Not my cup of tea, I guess.

Caylus turned out to be less than I expected it to be. Yes, it is very cerebral. Yes, there are many strategies and many vicious ways to benefit yourself and screw other players. But...

Well, the game is dry as desert sand, ugly as an old goat and very abstract. I can't say I don't like it, but I really am not as crazy about it as I though I'd be.

All in all, I can see it's a solid game and a classic... which fails just a little at doing it for me.

Bought this on hype - thinking it would be a natural replacement for Puerto Rico (which out group had played to death).

So, this is a better game than Leonardo Da Vinci, but that doesn't make it a good game.  In particular, I've decided the whole "worker-placement" is just not my cup of tea.  I'll try AoE and maybe Agricola, but I sure don't have high expectations after my earlier introductions.

Caylus in particular seems to be just a little too convoluted for me.  In particular, there's just too many colors of cubes.  No, I don't care what the purple one is versus what the darker brown one is.  Additionally, the huge selection of buildings is *not* a positive in my book.

All in all, just not my cup of tea.

RATING: 9
Simply one of the best worker placements money can buy.  All the systems within the game balance eachother perfectly, giving multiple routes to victory with adjustments to your game plan required based on which one you choose.

The basic premise is that you are trying to construct a castle along with the outlying village in order to score points.  Constructing buildings can score points throughout the game as any player who activates your building gives you a point, whereas expanding the castle nets you points and potentially a favour from the king which can prove to be very useful.

This game can be quite cutthroat, but only in a good way - you are rarely prevented from doing at least something useful, the game is designed well enough that you can modify your turn plan to concentrate on another part of your 'engine' if you get blocked on a particular round.

My favorite of the medium-weight Worker Placement (Puerto Rico, Agricola, Le Havre etc.) genre. The theme of this one is beyond boring, but the mechanics more than make up for it. I like that you can invest heavily in one strategy, but that you still have to do work building the castle and interact with your fellow players to have any shot at winning. The start-player mechanism, as well as the movement of the provost/bailiff, and the ability of players to mess with this movement, are great. 

Works well for 2-5, though 5 is a bit long

This hits all the right buttons for me.  It's tough, but you can improve.  It's dry, but its gameplay more than makes up for it.  It's complicated at first but after a few turns you realize how smooth it is (I even taught my parents to play).  Honestly, any other worker placement game out there just feels like Caylus watered down or festooned with useless bells and whistles (and this is coming from someone who first played it 9 years after it was released).

RATING: 9
The Mother of all games to me. I thought the original version looked a bit boring so I was really happy to learn that a "limited edition" existed (which doesn't seem to be that limited after all, or did they print too many copies?). 
I like the healthy amount of stress that you can get while deciding where to place your next worker. Oh, and to collect enough money in order to be able to place them. Oh, and the Royal favours. Oh, and to collect the resources in the right order in case you want to construct buildings. Just too many things to consider... which is nice. :-)
A well-deserved 9.

Caylus is neither the most attractively-presented of games nor particularly well-balanced. But it is among the most interesting. The various mechanisms which balance money, resources, points and other actions are not original in themselves but are put together into a somewhat novel, if inelegant whole. UPDATE: coming back to Caylus after a number of years and I find that it has stood the test of time. Even with the existence of Caylus Magna Carta, there is still a reason to return to the original game.

More complex than Puerto Rico, which on one hand might increase long term intrest/playablity.  But on the other, makes it harder to introduce to new players. Also unlike Puerto Rico, I feel you can totally dig yourself into a hole that you will not be able to climb out of.  

Basicly, Puerto Rico is a better all around casual game.  While I feel is the "hard core" version.

I played this one when it first came out and I absolutely hated it.  It was dry.  I could care less about impressing the king.  And it played far too long for what I got out of it.  

Flash forward a few years and I tried it again to see if my opinion of the game changed.  I didn't think the game was as bad as I first thought, but it still left me as "eh".  The mechanics work very well, but for most of the game I had no idea how I was doing (I came in a close second because everyone paniced and filled in the castle the last round).  Even with 5 people playing, it felt like a solitaire game.  On your move you try and make the optimal move that is left.  The only real interaction in the game is when moving the provost token to screw your opponents out of actions or replacing a tile someone else might want to use next turn.

I might try it one more time, but if I never do I won't be missing anything.

There's so many things to like about the game: the nice wooden components, the small amount of downtime between turns, and the many paths to victory.  That being said, I have one major complaint about the game: I have a very hard time explaining the rules properly because there's so much interaction between the rules.  (Puerto Rico had this problem as well.)  To teach this game to my opponents, I have to explain the rules during play.  It gets really frustrating explaining the rules for the first few turns, but by turn 5 or so, the opponents usually have a good understanding of the rules and then the game goes much more quickly.  Still, if your opponents can get through one game, they'll usually come back for more.  Then the game is fantastic.

RATING: 6
Good game with lots of choices.  However, it appears that game length will vary greatly based on differing play styles/choices and number of players.  Rating will likely slide higher after more plays, but 8 is my top end when first rating a game.

UPDATE:  Bumped up half a point after my second play.

UPDATE: Bumped down after 3rd play and entire YEAR gap between playings.  There is just not enough here to justify its length.  If I play a game for 2.5+ hours it is going to be a war game.

After getting familiar with tons of heavy euro-games Caylus is not so deep, unique and thrilling as at first...  It's still a solid design, but its flaws are more and more evident (lack of balance in some areas, repetetivness to some degree, lack of freshness).  It seems just outdated now.

EDIT:  After exactly 10 games I have enough.  The game always falls into similar tracks.  There are always the same best favours, buildings, actions.  And repetitive strategies.  All this makes the game too restricted for my taste.  I don't see further replayability.

The game has completely burnt out for me.

inital rating:  I'm digging this game, love the number of choices and multiple paths to victory coupled with NO LUCK. A little dry but lots of strategies to be explored makes this a great game already...

[u]UPDATE:[/u]5 plays now with 2 players right to 4 players. Scales pretty good IMO although it does get to be too long with more than 3, great game that is tactical rich and it has strategy as well and some variety in those stratgies which is it's strength, the multiple paths. Still a little dry and doesn't have the big 'fun' factor to put it over the top although there is some especially with the screwage but the rating remains where it is and will stay here I believe, great game!

[u]UPDATE:[/u]Easy to see here that Keythedral was a big influence for this game, some distinct similiarities. Rating goes up slightly to 9 now after more FTF plays, every game seems to be close with no one ever out of contention, a good definition of a 9 for me, a medium high weight game with  strategy, tactics, replay and 'competitively' fun

Still the best worker placement game, and one of the best games, period. The viciousness of jockying for provost control, the multiple but interrelated paths to winning (gold? prestige favors? prestige buildings?), the attention needed to worker sequencing (one-upped in VdG), the perfect information and zero-luck, all add up to perfection for me.

gekocht op Zuiderspel (april 2012) Eindhoven, eerste maal geprobeerd op... 30 december 2012. Als bouwmeester bouw je met je arbeiders aan het kasteel en/of aan het dorp langs de weg door grondstoffen te spenderen. De grondstoffen hout, linnen, voedsel, steen en goud kunnen worden gewonnen door de arbeiders, die op hun beurt weliswaar betaald moeten worden met dinars. Veel bouwen leidt tot prestigepunten, en af en toe ook tot koninklijke privileges. De volgorde van acties uitvoeren is heel belangrijk, en het nodige inzicht daarin vereist toch wel een zekere minimumleeftijd ("12+"). De spelregels lijken heel ingewikkeld, maar eens je aan het spelen bent, valt dat eigenlijk best nog wel mee. 
Gespeeld met Ward (8) in de vereenvoudigde versie (zonder koninklijke privileges); ging wel, maar het was toch wat veel/lang voor hem. Hij heeft het toch tot het einde volgehouden. :)

After a few plays I can see why it's so highly regarded. So many choices, so many effects, so many strategies. Is it the 2nd coming of Puerto Rico? Who cares? This is a decent game in it's own right and it doesn't need to lean on the reputation of the aforementioned game. That being said, it's not the the holy grail of games that some keep searching for. There is no such white elephant, keep looking. However, to the rest of us poor schlugs who just enjoy good games with many ways to win, a little screwage factor, and some fun, I recommend Caylus to you. Pity the poor fools who must compare everything to the "almighty" PR. Nuff' said. Still....after all the hype I can't help but be disappointed.  It's good but not nearly as great as it's being billed and too long for "what it is".

RATING: 6.5
Overrated. not much tension at all during the entire game. You'd think that during workers placement phase their would be a lot of tension to see who would get what, but that rarely occured. If your opponent picked a tile you planned on selecting that phase, no problem I'll just take this other tile instead. This game might have lots of interesting mechanisms, interesting decisions but it is boring.
Every turn you have to consider every possibility, since everything might change between your turns. There are no long-term strategy to be found. Very ugly graphics, especially the cover, board and tiles!

RATING: 8
Played only a few times and I really like it so far.  The rules are unnecissarily challenging (lack of pictures explaining what's what).  I like that it's a different game every time - and I don't mean that in the same way people say that about tile laying games.  In this one - all player may never choose the lawyer - and without this in play everyone has to have a different strategy.  Pretty cool!  I'm not a huge Peurto Rico fan (which similarly has different roles and different buildings that offer different purposes) - but I like this one a lot.  Rating could even go higher after more plays.

RATING: 8
The ruleset may seem daunting at first but there's a very tight euro here that simply works.  With various routes to victory, and a nice level of interaction that you don't see in all euro's, I really liked Caylus.

RATING: 9
Played once and really enjoyed it.  Many decisions and paths to gain points.  It should hold up well to repeated playings.
Update: I have now played 4 times.  Each game evolved differently, yet all were a lot of fun.   Great game with many paths to victory possible.

I find the provost to be incredibly difficult to plan around, I just don't know what other players are going to do each round. Some rounds, several people go near the provost and therefore work together to keep the provost away, other rounds no one does and whoever goes near the provost will get screwed.

There are so many other games that I would rather play.

Caylus is a pure Euro in which you are all helping to build a castle for fame and victory points.  This is a worker placement game in which more building sites are made available as the game progresses.  A unique aspect of the game is that the buildings are being added along a road and there is a provost piece that can be moved back and forth at the advancing edge of this zone that can result in some of the new buildings not being available for use.  This makes for some tense moments and bargaining.  Other than that, one is accumulating resource cubes by using the buildings (only one worker per building) and to build more buildings and ultimately add to the castle.  There is also an interesting mechanic with king's favors that advance one along one of several tracks that provide useful bonuses, depending on the strategy one has adopted.  Overall, an enjoyable game so I'll not say no to it but not one that grips me afterwards or gets me looking forward to the next game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good worker placement game.  Plays well with 2-4.  I have little 5p experience, but it's supposed to be good with that number as well.

This is one that was played to death by a lot of people when it first came out.  I didn't play it that much, but it still makes it difficult to get on the table now.  BSW has a good implementation, although most of the games there are played 2p.  Expect to see a heavy emphasis on the building favors track, as that seems to dominate the 2p online games.  I'm not saying that it's an unbeatable strategy, rather that for whatever reason the online players gravitate heavily toward that style of play.

I would like to play this more, and especially get a group to the point where more is understood about the provost.  Most players treat this exclusively as a hammer to use against unwitting folks who hang their workers way out toward the baliff.  It's used less often to control game length, which I suspect is its main strength.

Rated after my first game, a 3-player.  I enjoyed the game and thought the various games systems worked very well.  The provost, while not being used often, did give you something extra to think about. I need more games to gain familiarity with the buildings - hopefully I can find others who will still play.

The new board fixes is the color issue, so I bump the game to a well deserved 8 rating.

I really like this game, but I had to ding it pretty hard for its color blind gamer unfriendliness. Could they have made the color squares on the tiles any smaller? Or used less distict colors? Who thinks picking colors consisting of grey, brown, pink, purple and yellow is a good idea?
Oh well the game itself is great, but I made several blunders because I mistook one of the small colors on the board for a different color.

It's the kind of game that you don't want to ask somebody what color a critical icon is, because you will invariably give away your intentions and allow someone else to thwart them.

This publisher really seems to have been influenced by Aladdin's Dragons (this one and Ys have a flavor of AD).

Rating is after 2 plays (both times with 5 players... have been told it players better with less so hoping to try).

Update: played with 2 players and it's quite a different game w/2 player rule modifications (no computing for turn order, the Inn isn't that useful esepcailly by mid-game).

Wow, now this is a hard game! The sheer hugeness of possibilities, the weird setup, and the always-different game are at the same time very innovative and scary. Good game, very well balanced. The interactions of the different buildings are very intriguing. Very dry, with lots of analysis paralysis. For brainiacs.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Update: Despite my lukewarm impression of the game, I have also bought the deluxe version. While the usability of components in Mike Doyle's version is poor(er), it just looks darn cool. :)

First impression: Nice, heavy German game, but too darn long and slow for its own good. Plenty of tactical and strategical choices and multiple paths to victory lead to a challenging game.

But to me it's not even close to the classics in the genre. I feel Caylus has a processual and over-complex feel to it, which I normally associate with Rüdiger Dorn's designs: Lots and lots and lots of elements in the game all interacting in various ways and the whole thing, while fun, all comes out seeming a bit messy and making you think whether the designer couldn't have cut 25% of the rules without impacting the depth of the game.

The processual feel reminds me of Goa, where one's planning is also of the "if I do A, I can then do B, which will give me the resources to buy C, which will let me get D, which yields VP, etc." kind.

My main dissatisfaction with the game, however, is its slow pace and its resulting (much too long) length. Could the game be played comfortably in about 1½ hours, my rating would go up (at least) a point.

RATING: 9
Build in the castle and move a provost.  There is little luck in this game, and many people prefer it with 2 players because of the lack of chaos.  I am not one of those.  This is a great game for 4-5 players, although one player will not be able to control what is available and what they do as well as in 2 players.  The chaos really adds to the interest, and competition for spots and favors really increase with more people.

Definitely a great game, but hard to see it getting played a whole lot more with my large collection and the dry theme. I like the theme, fwiw, but it's pretty light.

Decisions are great. Art is very good. It's actually not very difficult to teach. Planning ahead is key, and the potential for screwage is HUGE. Probably a little meaner than what my heavy group usually plays.

Tense, fairly deep, probably the best worker placement game.  Definitely more to it than meets the eye.  Have played many times with 2/3 and once with 5; like it more with 2/3 players.

The provost, and the faceoff for the castle have to be the two most important parts of this game; the fight over the castle creates fantastic tension.  But there isn't just one way to win.

I really like the simplicity of setup, the lack of thousands of bits, and the tense, but not overwrought gameplay Caylus brings to the table.

Initial Rating: 9.5 (October 2010)

A game I have played a few times and I think that´s why I enjoy it. I feel the game has little replayability as the tactics and strategies remain the same (but the fun is in learning them) game after game. Initially I preferred this over Agricola, but I now realize I’m  enjoying Agricola more and more. Agricola, with its myriads of cards, offers a radical different experience with each game while Caylus will stagnate (I feel) after a determinate number of plays.

However Caylus is a very well designed game, there is always great pressure on what to do on your turn, there's is very little luck in the game (a fact that I always like in strategy games) and I really like the resource management/worker placement dynamics. 

I think this game will go no further in my personal ratings but right now Caylus is a game I really enjoy so I won’t refuse a play of it....yet.

Caylus was part of my top ten favorite games some time ago.

I still enjoy Caylus but we don’t play is as often as before. As I feared each Caylus game feels very similar so I’m downgrading its rating even more. I recognize it is a solid design and perhaps I will buy it in the future.

The issue I have with the game, is that I feel it always plays the same way or very similar, due to this, my desire to play it again is rather low, however, I must confess I have fun when I do.

I don’t think I will buy it and I’m downgrading its rating.

Competition can be very intense for favors and over the provost, making this game a relatively more stressful experience.

Gets less interesting with more players.  5 really isn't a good number for this game; there's too little to be accomplished and too much downtime.

Caylus really goes up and down for me, more than any other game.  Right now it's down, or at least "meh."  This is probably the most "elegant" implementation of worker placement, to throw out a Euro buzzword, but it doesn't always feel fun to me, and that means a lot.

In the end I think Caylus is probably too confrontational a game for me to really enjoy.  I don't find the maneuvering for the favor and the screwage of the provost particularly fun or interesting, though they do encourage player interaction.

Haven't gotten it played. I've just had trouble drumming up enthusiasm in my friends. 

These kind of 'heavier' games are more to my interest than to my casual gaming friends on-the-whole. 

I absolutely have to remember that when I buy games...it's not for me, it's IF it will get played. 

I just don't have as much discretionary budget flow as I did and I don't have time nor space for shelf fillers anymore.

I would really like to try this one out though. I've got a couple of new groups that may actually allow it to see light.

I avoided this game for almost 2 years.  A family member owned it and kept trying to get it to the table, but I thought it looked dry and tedious.  One night, three of us decided to bite the bullet and just get it over with.  Well, all three of us left the table and couldn't wait to play it again.  It hits the perfect balance of the game mechanisms we love...worker placement, resource management, engine-building, various routes to victory (but not too many), a little take-that (when you just have to make a move that messes someone else's game up).  There is surprisingly low down-time, and that time is taken up scouring the board for your next move, especially when the previous player took your planned move out from under you.  This is a top 10 for sure.  I most love it with 3 players, but 2 is good too.  I bought a copy for my husband and I.

RATING: 5
I play a lot of 5 player and the game is too long for that, even when my son becomes the Caylus Commando.  I like games that make you plan ahead.  I also like games that make you think on your feet and adjust your strategy because of what others are doing.  Unfortunately, this game really requires you to do both and that is what marks it down for me.  What I mean by that is - if you have to plan out something for a couple of turns to be really successful, but then also have to change your plans quickly because of what others do, it is hard to do the first thing.  It is like those two aspects of the game work against each other.

Very tactical game.  Lots of things to keep an eye on and keeps players involved, though can be difficult to recover from a poor opening.  Bit concerned that there are no distinctive different strategies with the best option to play a balanced game taking opportunities as they arise.  Plays well with 2 players. Fiddly FtF.  Opinion improving with more plays and discovered it plays well for 4 players and with different strategy to 2 and 3 player versions.

Three plays on BSW.

The difficulty of dealing with the BSW interface aside, this is an excellent game.  The decisions are tough, and the mechanics allow for a significant amount of interaction.  So far, there appears to be enough depth here to allow for multiple routes to victory, a hallmark of replayability.

The length of the game is ameliorated by the relative lack of player downtime.

Now if the publishers could get their heads out of their collective asses and I could _own_ a copy. . .

2 plays so far.  I can never seem to manage being the "best builder" of the castle in a given turn.  Great dynamics between different game systems make for compelling decisions each turn.  However, long term planning is a real art form, because it is hard to predict what you will be able to do a turn or two down the road.  Rules burden is a little high - a good 30 minutes to teach new players how it works.

RATING: 8
Another play... another bump in my rating. Fans of [b]Ys[/b], [b]Manila[/b] and [b]Puerto Rico[/b] should enjoy this one.  Place meeples (actually workers... but they [i]could[/i] have been meeples) to do your work and get awards.

There are  different awards for different buildings.  Costs and bonuses make it a tight resource management game.  The early game is cutthroat... there are only 22 initial places for workers, and six workers for each of the five players.

The game length can be controlled somewhat by the players themselves by movement of the [i]Provost[/i]... a mechanic that I tend to like.  Want a short game? Move him forward... Screw your neighbour and extend the game?  Move him back.

Because it's a perfect information game, I think that the game will be [b]very[/b] prone to [i]analysis paralysis[/i] for certain players.  I expect that a five player game to take [i]at least[/i] a half hour for each player for the first few games.  This will definitely improve as players become familiar with the mechanics.  

[b]Caylus[/b] is a mix of many different mechanics and it seems to be very well balanced with many paths to victory.  If it sells as well as I think it will, I expect that there will be additional building expansions in the future.  My only problem with the game is that, like [b]Puerto Rico[/b], there is no DIRECT player interaction... no trading, no direct competition and any deals that a player might make with others are not binding. I agree with Mike Siggins in that the game really deserves a bit more luck and, maybe, hidden resources.  It definitely won't unseat [b]Louis XIV[/b] as my favourite game of 2005, but it's close.  Like a lot of other games, it gets better with every play.  And now that it's on BSW, I've played it more in the past three weeks than the number of times I played Louis XIV all last year!

Really, what's wrong with this game?  Zero luck!  Not too difficult to learn, but there are several subtle strats you need to know to do really well.  After several face-to-face and even more BSW plays, this gem stays atop as my favorite.
Each round is a challenge to maximize your worker placements and slow your opponents.  The provost adds a little bit of nastiness, but careful play can minimize the risk.  Biggest rookie mistake is to not share the burden of the provost movement and get burned too often.

This is my initial rating based on the first game only. We had a very good time playing it - my biggest quibble is that the turns went so quickly that some of the mechanics seemed very repetitive. I really like the fact that it is an action selection game like Puerto Rico, but where you never have all of the actions taken in any given turn. 

Edit: After a couple additional plays, I still really like the game. The in turn housekeeping of adding and removing the little pieces is driving me crazy though.

Very complex worker placement game. I think it's a game I should play alot more to get accustomed with. But I think its the problem with heavy worker placement games in general. They will have their specific fans but fail to grab the general crowd.

28.10.2009: I liked it and I would like to play it more. However, the rest of the gaming group wasn't too impressed. I don't know why, really. Will probably trade this away someday. I really would like to play it again before that though, since I feel the game was dismissed too early.

Ystari Games 1st edition.  This game is being compared to the likes of Puerto Rico, Goa and Princes of Florence, all wonderful games in my book.  The Baliff and Provost of Caylus are two neutral character elements in the game affecting irregularity in scoring and game length respectively... a very interesting idea and one that I haven't seen before.  Game length is a bit long for us.  

Resource management at it's best, though I prefer both Puerto Rico and Pillars of the Earth more.

Develop resources to increase your prestige with the King. What resources are available depends on what you build, where you place, and how you control the king's men. This is a long game with a lot going on, but there is a sense of value the whole way through.

BIG PLUS: interactive with other players, sense of value
BIG MINUS: time (expect at least an hour)

EXTRA POINTS: great iOS version with a weak tutorial

I'm currently not sure what to think of Caylus. In all but one of the games that I've played the person who pumped up the VP favor track ran away with the game(the only game that played different was with three players and the Building favor track made the difference). Now this may be a case of group think but I'm not sure. I'm willing to give the game a couple more tries but I don't think I'm going to be the guy asking for it to be played.

I've now seen a little variety in what can be done to win the game but I'm even less excited about the game as I play it more. Game play is slow and repetitive as players are each taking turns placing their workers at a location to do something.

Fine game.  What is especially impressive is how the fabric of the game changes based on what buildings get played in what order.  Sometimes, everybody is buiding the castle furiously, other times, the prestige buildings are the key factor.  Too long though, and a bit hard on the brain.  Also, you will make tons of extremely embarrassing mistakes during your first few games.

Excellent game that established the "worker placement" mechanic. The rules themselves are not complicated, but it's impressive how complex the implications of simply placing a worker can be. I think the game as a few very minor flaws (the king's favors are of unequal value, for example).

**UPDATE** Years later, this is still an excellent game. Lowered a point because the flaws I saw earlier I do think hinder the game from total excellence.

JUEGAZO.

Muy fluido, tras 1 ó 2 turnos la mécanica del juego se entiende perféctamente, y una vez familiarizado con las losetas no queda otra cosa más que disfrutar del juego (si tus rivales te lo permiten).

Multitud de combos para hacer puntos y una alta interacción, vamos, para que no vayas sólo a lo tuyo. Si te descuidas te las puedes llevar todas en el mismo lado.

Las monedas metálicas le dan el toque perfecto al juego.

Es un MUST HAVE.

THE GAME.

It goes very fluid, in only 1 or 2 turns you will know how to play it perfectly, and after knowing the tiles you only can enjoy this game (if your opponents let you to do it).

A lot of different combinations for getting points and a high level of competition, you have to keep an eye on your opponents... you can be punish if you don't do it.

Metal coins give the perfect touch to the game.

It is a MUST HAVE.

Picked up at Essen 2005. Played once, initial impressions are good. Preliminary rating would be around 8 or 9, but need more plays. Felt heavier than I thought, but that might have been due to learning the game.

Update after second play: Very good game, rating 9. The initial heaviness reaction was probably due to learning it, it felt much less heavy second time even though there are some agonizing decisions to be made.

Bought and played in 2005. This was my first worker placement game and while I appreciate the design it just isn't for me. A thinly pasted cube-pushing-resource converting machine with an inelegant ruleset and very little player interaction. 

Traded for Die Macher.

RATING: 5
Rating after 30-35 plays.  Downgraded rating from an initial 8 mainly because I find no great desire to play it that much. My recent thoughts are that while this is a solid game, the favor tracks are not balanced -- the resource track does not seem to be as strong as the building track or the VP track which seem to be the key paths to victory.  It's not a killer like the Mistress on Turn 1 in St Petersburg, and there are things you can do to control the situation.  It's just that I don't find Caylus as interesting given more recent games such as Leonardo, Imperial, Pillars or Through the Ages.  In retrospect, I believe Caylus' high ratings here on BGG are an artifact of the fact that there were few other strong new games at Essen 2005, whereas the larger group of stronger games (many of which took several months to work their way up the charts) meant none of those games got the immediate boost up the charts we saw with Caylus.The rest is from of my original comment, from over a year ago:  OK, shoot me, but I just don't think this game is the second coming many here have raved about.  No doubt about, Caylus is a very good game, well thought out, fairly straightforward and some unique game mechanics, but it is NOT in the same class as my two all-time favorites, Die Macher and Puerto Rico.  It is at heart a resource management and placement game, placement of the workers being the key strategic decision each turn.  Game differs tremendously with different numbers of players, in my view it's a bit too easy with 3, too chaotic with 5, feels about right with 4.  I generally like games where you have alot of choices, in Caylus, at times, it seems there are almost too many choices--meaning it's a game that could suffer from analyis paralysis with the wrong set of players.  You basically have to decide on an optimum play or set of plays each turn that is unlikely to be disrupted by your opponents.  Caylus was easily the best new game from Essen 2005, but it was generally a weak year for really good new games there.  I wonder if the game will retain its current level of popularity say, five years from now.

Sept. 2010 Update:  Re-rated the game for a second time, dropped it to a 5.  Not only do I have no desire to play  it any more, I have actually used the bits from my original game for prototypes and mock-ups from other games ... never a good sign.  This game, which was the darling of the Geeks when it first came out, has fallen mightily in my opinion.  I know there are people out there that still love and appreciate it, but I am not one of them.

Classic worker placement game. I got this in a Maths trade. I don't know if I will ever get to play it, but at least I can play it on BSW now. I don't like to play games on there that I don't know or at least have a physical copy of. Worried that I will take to long over my turns otherwise.

No luck, hard decisions, several paths to victory, high player interaction. Components and paintings are good although I don't like the coin tokens.

A mish-mash of different component parts that don't quite gel with the theme - we're doing what? Building a castle? Where? Oh.  It doesn't look like a castle.

The first of the worker placement wave.  Deep, heavy euro with a surprisingly nasty player interaction element (provost bribing) and a challenging learning curve.

There are some complexities to doing well in this game that may take a couple plays to understand. You are collecting resources to help build the castle and to build new buildings. The buildings keep getting better so the best are near the front of the road. Unfortunately, there is a marker that people can move to prevent use of spaces near the end of the road. Also there is a bonus for building the most at the castle during a turn. So trying to predict your neighbor is part of the challenge. Finally one must save the proper resources and build some prerequisite buildings to be able to build the buildings with the most victory points. Note the iPad version seems well done and offers some challenging play.

Have now played it 2-player, and it's quite fun, but a bit of a brain burner -- a lot like playing Chess.  The constraint per turn is more the 6 workers (action) than any other resource (though watch out if your opponent mismanages their funds from the turn before ...), and make sure to take the Merchant's Guild if you want to play near the provost (your opponent would have a big incentive to screw you there).  Interesting to see how the dynamic changes in 3-5 player games.

I very much enjoy this game but really need to be in the mood to play it.  I usually play it 2 player, which is a little less interesting than with 3 or 4; there seem to be fewer paths to victory with only 2 (you cannot afford to not build in the castle, for example, and gold becomes more valuable).  Playing with 5 is extremely frustrating, but in a fun way.  Beautiful components.

A standard Euro classic that suffers from few faults. Fascinating mechanics that make every game feel and play completely differently; competitive qualities that feel distinct from most worker placement games i've played; numerous strategies (an excellent one to try out across several friend groups: watch as your brilliant strategy with one group is smashed by another!)

The one aspect of the game that could be improved is the "King's Favour" track which feels decidedly over-complicated (and is a chore to explain to new players).  This is a small complaint however. Buy it!

Good game but 5 years later it is hard to understand why this game got this overwhelming reception when it was released. Its main advantage compared to other worker placement games is replayability. The player-created action track combined with the provost guarantee that no single round feels repetitive - a problem too familiar with many other worker placement games. It's probably still the pinnacle of perfect information worker placement games with no luck. It is also the pinnacle of disgusting graphics. An area where Ystari usually excels in bad taste.

Finally played this and liked it. I love the multitude of choices and how you can plan one turn off of another to create opportunities. The provost is a nice screwage element. It's almost polite screwage in that it'll cost someone money or an action to stick it to you, and you can't ever really say that you didn't see it coming. Love that the game can develop very differently with each play; that was very evident after just a couple of plays. Took 4 of us two and a half hours and I'm confident we'll bring that down with more familiarity. [update: times in cleanly under 2 hours for an experienced group.] Good good stuff.

It's difficult to learn the game by reading the rules (though the rules are very well-written), but once you start playing it's all very intuitive.  The theme of the game is kind of ho-hum, but it is very challenging, offering a plethora of choices that can almost be overwhelming.  The choice of buildings and how they work together seems to be much more involved, than, say, Puerto Rico.  I like the mechanism of the provost, which adds a bit of uncertainty and double-guessing.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the playing time - our initial 3-player game clocked in at 1.75 hours including rules, and subsequent play makes it more of a 1 hour game, which is great.  I find that a 2/3 player game is much different than 4/5 as resources/money are much more plentiful, rendering many of the buildings/options less useful.  But because of play time alone, I would hesitate to play this with 4 or 5.

Wonderful game. Incredible replayability, player interaction, well themed, such tight interweaving strategy. 
Downsides for me is there isn't much of a feeling of ownership, it feels too short, almost cut-off. It is prone to paralysis analysis and I don't think this will reduce with play. It's a tough one to learn, getting to the first play is more difficult than Puerto Rico, first play through will clarify nearly all but the strategies will take even more time. A slowburner, but something I expect may grow in my estimation. UPDATE: It has, from a 7 to an 8. The main change was just a few more plays and thinking about the possibilities of expansions

RATING: 8
A versatile game. It is hard to grasp what to do simply by reading rules. An interesting use of Provost figure to block some (usually more useful) actions. Moreover, sometimes it is easy to forget to pay the workers. Everything else looks clear, intuitive and understandable. But which action to choose out of the whole set? I clearly want to try it more.

Įvairiapusis žaidimas, kuriame sunku iš karto suprasti, ką reikia daryti. Gana įdomus Provost figūrėlės panaudojimo būdas - blokuoti tam tikrus (dažniausiai naudingesnius) veiksmus. Beje, pakankamai nesunku pamiršti sumokėti darbininkams algą. Visa kita atrodo aišku, intuityvu ir suprantama. Tik ką iš visos veiksmų aibės pasirinkti? Aiškiai norisi išbandyti dar kartą.

Have only played it about 5 times, tied for the win in a 4 player game finally, otherwise I've lost horribly.  Doesn't seem to be too many viable strategies with the royal favors yet, unless its just group think.

*Update*  Got some more plays in now.  Its great.  Can win in a number of ways.  Have won a game never taking the building favor track against people who did, disproving my theory that it was too powerful.

Downrated back to 8.  This just doesn't get out enough--mostly due to its longer playing time.

Rating after 3.5 plays.  Upgraded from 8 from the 1st play.  Lots of interesting decisions and doesn't seem to have a set strategy (yet).  Provost has a lot of "take that", which could be a problem if played with the wrong crowd.

Every move forces each player to adapt and consider their next placement very carefully, both in terms of how beneficial it will be to them personally and how little it will aide their opponents.

RATING: 8
There are mostly things to like. The only random variables are at the setup creating differing starts for the game while not damaging any player, there's a lot of resource management (workers, money, goods), new buildings brought into play make the older ones "obsolete", choices are always tough: whether to take this or that when knowing that you really won't be getting the other one later, both strategic and tactical elements, several different ways to score, no clear strategy to win, no real downtime and a good level of player interaction. And the game seems to be all the merrier and tighter the more players you have. Only negative aspect so far is that a player who sees he has run out of chances to win may just start to push the game to end faster and become a kingmaker in the process. That's not nice in a game that lasts so long. Also, the balance of the favour track may be an issue.

RATING: 9
There are constant decisions here and you have to weigh their values against what you think others might do before your next choice. The game's weakness is that a player can be in such a poor position by mid-game that he has no reasonable chance to win. Update: After hundreds of plays online and 15 in person this game never gets old. For my taste Caylus is the first and only %u201Cperfect%u201D boardgame. Bravo Signor Attia! Update - back to 9: On further reflection and after about a year in which I have not played a game in which someone could compete with me I have to admit that there is a flaw in the game that affects my enjoyment - the fact that an experienced player will absolutely crush an inexperienced one and this will happen 100% of the time. I really prefer games where the experienced player wins 70% of the time - decisions are still meaningful and strategic but the game's outcome is in doubt for much of the game. The only solution to this is to concentrate on five player games - a great player can lose those to a good player due to the luck of what other players choose. Perhaps then the five player game still deserves a rating of 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The worker wage being based on number of players who have passed is a very clever mechanism. The batches and favors also make for much tension, and allow for different strategies. I wish there was some sort of randomness at set-up, so that the games didn't have the potential of all being the exact same.

Similar to Goa and Keythedral in feel, but it takes twice as long to play. I'll take Agricola for long worker placement games and either one of the above two (or Tribune) for faster paying games... Which leaves Caylus sitting in my shelf collecting dust. 

This still gets an OK rating, because it really isn't a bad game, but its been totally overshadowed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Worker placement game that could be, and perhaps should be for best effect, utterly calculating and cutthroat. My first game took around four hours but didn't really feel like it. Complete lack of cards is appreciated. It's obvious that this can be a completely different game depending on how the provost is handled, and how much attention players pay to what can and should be done to control the game timer and/or hurt those who expose themselves to hurtage. As another example of how mistakes can be brutally punished, the programmed order of resolution means that being blocked out of an action can render already placed workers useless and effectively set you back an entire turn. The prudence and analysis that is ultimately called for will not make for a casual game.

Reading the comments of my GeekBuddies revealed some interesting contradictions: it's too dry, but it's too chaotic; it's the first of its kind, but it's a complete rip-off. There were also some seemingly valid concerns about playability and replayability, e.g. blandness of actions and currencies, efficiency imbalances, lack of evolving gameplay, kingmaking through action or inaction. However, these are hardly uncommon characteristics in games, even good and/or acclaimed ones.

Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway and I sat down and played Caylus, F. Scott Fitzgerald was running late.

Scott Fitzgerald showed up he said that he had already rated it even though he had not played it.  I said how could you rate it without playing it and again Gertrude Stein punched me in the mouth.

For some reason, the theme works better than any other (popular) game (for me). Competitive logistics. Rather "pretty" (for those who care).

I still think this is an excellent game.  My current rating reflects only my current desire to play.  Although my number of plays does not show it I have played Caylus more than 20 times, and it is only due to having played it repeatedly over a short period of time that my rating went down.  I can still recommend this game as a great worker placement game that is really not difficult to learn, but that will provide many hours of interesting play.

Doesn't live up to the hype, but still a great game.  Very interesting decisions, tons of victory paths and good interaction.  Box says 60-150 minutes, but it should have just said 150 minutes.  Way too long in my opinion.  Playing with players suffering from AP is excruciating.  If there is a "Speed Caylus" variant, this rating will go up...

EDIT: Played it again six years later and it still feels too long.  Played a 3 player game and it was 2.5 hours.  I'd like to play again with experienced players and see if this game ever takes less time (I'm told it does).

This was has begun to grow on me as I have played it more.  However, its another one of those games in which everything you do puts you in a better position from where you were before.  This may sound like a good thing for a beginner since there is no way one can crash and burn.  However, the problem is that unless you have played it a lot you don't have an idea of whether what you are doing is better or worse than some other play you could have made.  There's nothing like going bankrupt or dying or having your capital captured to let you know that you probably did not adopt the best strategy.

Caylus is a very complex, very rewarding game that gets very little playtime due to its incredible complexity. Puerto Rico plays as a light filler for this game. The rules are simple enough but the multiple stages of Caylus mean that, for an initial playthrough or so, chances are a player will make a purely mechanical mistake that may fundamentally change a game. (I bring this up because I've seen it happen more than once.) 

But Caylus is a very deep, very thoughtful game with multiple paths of victory that requires one to be prescient of the goals and activities of other players on the board. The Take-That factor is under the surface but is skinny.

This game is completely replaced by Carson City for me.  Sure every game has elements that no other game can replace and Caylus is no exception.

I don't understand the hype of this game. I was very disappointed in Caylus. I have played twice, and each game had a runaway leader. Normally, this isn't too much of a problem, but all other players just had to go through the motions for another 2 hours, when it was clear who the winner would be early on. I find it acceptible for one player to be "out of the game" for a half hour or even an hour, but not when ALL other players are out of the game for 2 hours.

The game design is a little bland, but the game itself is exceptional. It scales well for two players, with lots of choices and just the right amount of confrontation. I especially like the fact that players can speed up or slow down the game! No doubt about it, Caylus is a superb Euro worker placement game. It's the chess of the Euro game world, with essentially no luck and enough strategic decisions to keep it fresh through hundreds of plays. Unfortunately, being able to play it on iOS or online in half the time made it pointless to keep a copy of the game.

The game that started the worker placement craze. Really well done, multiple paths to victory, your choices can be double edged swords, bad situations can be used at your advantage, good player interaction, etc...

The only problem I can see is that since there's no random event at all in the game and the very limited starting setups of the board, I feel the game might become sterile after a while like chess. If it's false, I will likely upgrade the rating to 9 or even 10.

I liked this game with 5 (my rating is tied most closely to this version), but it seemed a bit long, something that might be remedied with time.  I played again with 4, and tested some interesting strategies to see how they would work.  While I enjoyed my playing of the game, we had one individual who suffered from AP (the bane of this game), and the endgame suffered from the provost as kingmaker.  As a 4 player game, I give it a 6, at most.  I think the best combo of interaction, strategy, and playlength may come with 3, but I have yet to confirm my theory.

I can see why there is a hype for this game but after a couple of plays I just do not feel like playing it all that often. To me this game is a lot of work. You work hard for three hours and then you most likely will have a very competitive and tense ending. So, after three hours you have this great climax and sometimes obvious king maker situations. Ok, the endings can be very exiting but what about the three hours of work getting there?
I just get tired thinking about it.

Played once so far - I can see why its touted as "Puerto Rico" beater. So much depth, so many potential strategies. Superb game.

(update) OK, now played 3 times. One 2nd pace, 5th and 4th. This game is superb - so many interactions, decisions and despite all of us having different strategies, they have all been really close. #1

This is the best strategy game I have played.  No element of luck, How you place your workers, if you can, has everything to do with your score.  2 player is a little too scripted for me, only one real strategy, but still enjoyable because of the variable set up and options.

Complex and breathtaking strategy game, which plays equally well with 2, 3, 4 or 5 players. A huge number of choices and options, which only expand as the game progresses and new buildings are constructed along the road to the castle. Downtime between turns is very low, as you are constantly involved. Very low on luck: only the initial starting order and the order of the neutral buildings. The gameboard is beautifully designed - all the information you need is either indicated on the board or the tiles.

I'm fascinated with this game. It is about building and getting profits from what you have built. It offers plenty of strategies to lead the game and to win it. Elements of the game complement each other very well. It's some kind of magic, I can't explain. Maybe, as an engineer, I love to build. :-)

One little drawback I had noticed is that at the end the game speed boost up and all resolves in that moment. You can play well entire game but at the end one mistake or unfortunate coincidence can ruin everything.

This game falls into the same category as Nautilus for me - too long for what it offers, but would be nice if it were shorter. Interesting mechanics and not too long waits between turns are a big plus, otherwise this might be a 5 for me. The game starts too slowly, and as it begins to build up speed, it's already over. That makes it sound like a short game, but it isn't - 3 hours is very near the minimum time it can take, and that's with 3 people. I don't want to imagine how long it would take with 5, and if there were AP -prone players included.

RATING: 8
I can understand how it seems repetitive and dry to some, because of no luck, no secrets and no surprises (unless you count opponents' sudden changes of strategy or bluffs with the provost that really got you). Even though it's about exploiting the same linear process every time, each game is quite different, and individual strategies can make it a game of scarcity or a resource-rich race for the big points. Keeps you on your toes and thinking way ahead for the chaining of actions and resources needed for them, which is why in Caylus I don't mind a little downtime.

Caylus works very good even with 2 players. The only gripe I'm having is that it really doesn't speed up much with experience. No way will this be played in the 30min/player that the box implies.

Definitely a mean, heavy weight Euro.   It's important to keep up your momentum through the mid-game, as I found to my dismay as others leap frogged over me for points.   Enjoyable with some agonizing decisions.   Strategic planning is key here, as is knowing what your opponents might do.

I really enjoy the game, and it plays out very differently with various groups of players.  Things change with the number of players as well.  The game can suffer a bit heavily from AP players, but a little good nudging can speed things along.  After all, most people can rank some intuitive priority for their worker placements.  It may certainly take a few plays for people to develop highly effective strategies.  We'll see if my rating changes as time goes by.

Nice but too long. There are some of the same elements than in Keythedral and in Puerto Rico, but definitely more Puerto Rico look-a-like. A brainburner where are many strategies to the victory. What it's missing is the "excitement" efect so that's why Caylus is not my favourite...

Updated (01/2011): Caylus never was my favorite game, but this one definitely has lost it's strenght because the same elements has been made better AND more compact later on. And if I never want to have my Caylus-moment, I would choose Caylus Magna Carta instead of this. Sorry, I've seen this one... (lowered my rating a bit).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Once upon a time ...1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.

The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game. The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.

Caylus is solid euro-game mechanically, but it feels a bit dry and long--especially with more players. With 'right' (er, wrong) players, the game can devolve into an overly analytical game with little player interaction. Because of this it can "feel" just a tad too mechanical. (If I were a [i]mentat[/i], it would be perfect... but I'm not, so I guess it isn't.)

There is 2 things I find good about this game. First all the rules are on the board, it makes it easier not to forget anything.

Second, I like making buildings where other people will give me points and resources to use them. It feels like monopoly: I'll build an hotel there and I expect high income. So you have to judge what the players need and build it. This is fun.

As for the rest of the game, I find it really boring. First, you can screw your self really easily if you miscalculate. At the beginning there is not much buildings so it's easier but when there is a lot of buildings it can become hard to calculate.

Second, this game  as a common syndrome that I found in hacienda. You have so many ways to score points that whatever you do, you will end up with an competitive score. So that in the ends, you do not really know that made you won.

Finally, some favors are really not useful compared to other favors. Getting extra cubes or building is no way comparable to getting more gold and victory points. In our game, the leader won because he collected 5 VP favor at least 5 times.

RATING: 7
This game is pretty good, I don't love worker placement games, but this is the best I have seen.  It gets a little repetitive, I feel like I end up doing the same thing every time, but maybe I just need to try a new strategy.  It's also a little annoying having to plan out your whole turn ahead of time, one mistake and you're dead.  I still like it, and I think it's well done.  A much better, longer lasting game than Agricola, in my opinion.

The guy on the cover though.  He is mean.  He makes you work and think and work some more.  Than he beats you if you lose.  That is why you work so hard at this game.  If it weren't for him this would just be another light fluffy Euro.

I think it's an excellent game with much going on but it is just NOT my cup of tea.  I really admire the splendid design but I usually prefer some or a little more randomness in my games.  Since it is long and prone to analysis-paralysis, I'm just not as head-over-heels about it as most folks are.  It is essentially a game that has two optimal strategies toward victory and is susceptible to group-think.  I would've preferred it to be 45 mins shorter than it is (and there are lots of lengthy games I much prefer).

After my initial play it is definitely a good game but not one that totally clicked with me.  Definitely time consuming on the first play; I can see how time might decrease on future plays as long as AP doesn't begin.  More decisions than one can usually do in a turn, the interconnections of the facets of the game (buildings, victory points, workers, fame, money, etc) was well done. However, it falls into the camp where you almost have to play it frequently for a while to get to the point where you can play through it quickly OR you are looking at nearly 3 hour game times potentially.

I love this game for it's complexity and balance. It seems like there is no save strategy. It all depends on what the other players do. And best of all: no random component. A modern classic, in my very opinion.

I can certainly understand why this game received so much attention after its release.  It is a very well designed "gamer's" Eurogame.  There seems to be an enormous amount going on and it's very difficult to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the different options effectively.  The playing time is a bit longer than most Euros and it is certainly a brain burner but this game has enough meat on its bones to make it all worthwhile.

Don't play Caylus with newbies: you'll probably have them snoring halfway through the explanation of the rules. But if you play it with a bunch of seasoned gamers - as you should - you'll discover an exquisite and perfectly balanced mechanic and I pretty much guarantee you'll have a great time (although don't play with 5 players or it will take too long). All the hype surrounding Caylus is totally justified and well deserved. The gameplay is very coherent, all the systems nicely fit together. However, since there is zero luck involved (apart from the initial play order) Caylus is a ruthlessly unforgiving game. Make a single mistake and you will be punished heavily and suffer to make a comeback. But that's the price to pay if you want to compete with the best. If you can play Caylus and survive, you're essentially ready to play anything. The only reason I won't give it a 10 is that its artwork is so ugly it's a crime.

Gran juego al que le veo 2 peros que le restan a mi opinión algunos enteros:
1. Aunque es un juego donde caben diversas posibilidades y estrategias, si tu rival utilizan contantemente el castillo para hacer PV's, a ti no te queda más remedio que hacer lo propio si no quieres quedarte atrás en el marcador de puntos.
2. El hecho de que los edificios que un jugador construya puedan ser utilizados por los rivales con una pobre compensación por ello hace que la estrategia creada por un jugador pueda ser destruida por sus rivales, sino aprovechada por ellos; este aspecto es el que más me chirría del juego, aunque no deja de tener su lado positivo; es un arma de doble filo al que le veo más peros que a favores, y que conste que soy de los que gustan de reventar las estrategias ajenas.
Una opción más que interesante es eliminar este efecto y que lo que construya cada jugador sólo pueda usarlo para sí; de esta forma el juego se convierte en una lucha de estrategias puras sin interferencias.

RATING: 5
I can understand why Caylus is popular, but I don't expect to play it much.  After several turns, the game became almost rote.  I find the use of the provost is unpleasantly spiteful; I really dislike mechanisms that can be turned into "everyone beat up on the lead player".  In a contentious game, it can make a trailing player into a kingmaker.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a game that just doesn't get played enough.  I think the problem is that it has a longer playing time and experienced players will score so much better than newbies.  I think this can be very discouraging.  So, while the gameplay is awesome, you do have to commit to some group learning time.

Fiddly, feels like someone tried to grab all "interesting mechanics" and shove them into one game, come what may.

My best definition for this game is a single word: Why?

3 games now - liked the initial play when everyone was new, but once people have put time into learning the game (and I haven't and don't have time or inclination to do so) then it is not fun anymore.

It looks to have so many options but just seems so constrained and one track to me.  Plus it takes too long.  Yuck.

I'd rather play Stone Age any day. More fun - more strategy - less constrained.  More forgiving.

Can't wait to try with more players, I'm sure things will be even more competitive.

What's there to say about this game that hasn't already been said? Highly throat-slitting gameplay in which you cannot help but get in each others face. Almost every game has each player within 2-7 points from each other. I don't think I've consistently played a game with so close a end-game point spread. Super tense and just so many roads to victory (my last win was almost exclusively by a end-game 'gold' victory - 11 cubes for 33pts + some 'favor' vp's for building a rather large batch in the castle on the final turn; very close).

Caylus's tremendous success implies that my tastes are very different than the average Eurogamer's. In particular, I think that tactical resource management isn't my thing. Where Puerto Rico has just enough strategy to keep it from being obnoxious to me, Caylus almost completely lacks long-term planning, and, as a result, I have little desire to play.

Now that the touchy-feely "this isn't my thing" stuff is out of the way, I also think that Caylus suffers from real design flaws as well, but most BGGers enjoy the good stuff *so* much that they just don't care. In particular, the castle is a big distraction from the heart of the game, which is the play on the road. If the castle was excised, the game would be faster, tighter, and more focused. You might need to add something to the road to make up for the castle's absence, but I think it would be a much more pleasant experience.

Unfortunately, this still doesn't address a rather boring resource-gathering element. With rare exceptions, the first part of each turn is a mad dash to gather as many resources as possible, with building options and a couple of other buildings like the jousting field and the inn the only buildings that compete on equal footing with the best available resource buildings. The special power buildings are much more interesting than the resource gathering ones, though, so the focus on resources, I think, makes the game rather dry.

Finally, provost play tends to swing between irrelevant – except siphoning away a little luchre – and massive screwage, with little in between. There is potential in the mechanic, but it doesn't seem to be properly set up. I can think of alternative rules for provost movement, but without playtesting it is hard to say which might be better.

While I bear Caylus no ill will, it definitely serves as an example of where my taste in games differs significantly from that of the BGG population as a whole.

Basically impossible to judge this game from one play, was quite tight at the end with different strategies, but felt like we barely scratched the surface of what is there.

Dryer than I expected. Very balanced - read: Fatalistic. It's a rare game which explicitly tells you when it is "early-mid-late" game; this one does that (it's printed on the board).

Such a variety of avenues to victory....even when the game is tight, there are many, many options. 

First came Ys from Ystari, which was a 9...with it's expansion it became a 10.

I was never surprised that their next release would be even better. I expect great things in Ystari's future.

Superb production values and graphic design are a hallmark of this company and it's games. If you are looking for a short game, or a filler, they have nothing to offer you. If you are looking for a deep gamer's game, welcome home.

Update:

Pending another play, this might drop as far as a 8. The mechanics are brilliant, and I really want to love this game, but I suppose maybe I just don't get it.

Either way, I'll play again and we'll see.

Update:

More plays, more effort, more paying attention to the people beating me silly finally gave me my light bulb moment. It's as good as I ever thought.

Update:

I finally knocked this one out of my top 10. Too many worker placement options have come along to outclass this one, however, it's one of the very few originals of the genre, and while still viable, is not the greatest among its peers.

Gorgeous to look at, and fantastic to play.  It gets bogged down a bit too much with more than three, but more than three does give it a much more epic feel.  Logical strategy and logical implementation of theme.  The board is great, since it summarizes all of the little rules right there for you, in a non-cluttered way.  You get to build a castle by stimulating the local economy and promoting urban growth.

The first worker placement game.  Place workers on buildings to gather resources, build buildings and score points from building.  Send batches of resources to the castle to score points.  There is some complexity in the economy as you must build residences before prestige buildings.  It can be fiddly in that you cannot forget to pay for your workers.  Money is very tight in the game.  

There are many people who criticize this game as dry, but the mechanics and the elegance of the game make it very fun.  I still play and I still have things to learn about this game.

RATING: 3
A decent gamer's game.  Don't break this one out at the next family reunion, though.  Endless possibilities strain the brain and lead to stupid mistakes.  It can be about a half hour to an hour too long to play.  Increased plays and familiarity by all players would probably help in both the length of play and decrease frequency of blunders (I hope so anyway).  I generally prefer a little more luck in a game than this one offers.  It's just too prone to staring at the board in endless max-min due to all the choices and open information.  I'd much rather play Aladdin's Dragons.

Highly strategic, luck-free game.  Gets better with multiple plays, as one learns the interactions between all the buildings.

3/2006: Expectations were sky-high with this much talked about game.  Impression after the first five-player game is that it's way overrated.
PROS: There some interesting mechanics in managing player order and what buildings get scored.  The game seem very well resource/money-balanced.
CONS: The game is way too long.  (We had to stop after three hours with probably about an hour and a half to go.)  Comparisons to PuertoRico are far fetch at the best.  It's much more comparable to Goa, though a tad better.  This game is tradisionally round-based and there's a lot of down-time between moves.  Components are not that good either with way too many different pieces and confusing graphics.

This was one of the first "gamer's games" that I experienced.  I enjoyed the game on my first play and then for some reason the next couple of plays I really didn't enjoy.  After about half a dozen plays it has started endearing itself to me again. So many options!

RATING: 9
The best game of 2005 for me.
I love the theme, the strategic options, the nail-biting plan-making and I want the game to keep going after the end.
If you like Puerto Rico or Goa, you'll love this - I fail to see how you couldn't.

The limited edition has drawn a lot of criticism, with suggestions that the board is difficult to understand. That is crap, and I think it's just a matter of people being used to one thing and changing (like how everyone thought Windows 95 had a crap interface when it came out). The limited edition (which I have) is the only version I have played, and it's great. The game feels a bit lighter than Agricola or Le Havre, but offers a stunning level of variety in how it plays each time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very straight and cut-throat game, always very satisfying to play. IMHO, the most outstanding element in Caylus is the choice you have to make every turn: whether to use as many workers as you can to speed up your businnes or sacrifice some actions in order to annoy or block your opponents. If you add the race for the slots at the castle and the moving of the Provost, you'll see that Caylus is one of the most interactive Euro games out there, at ALL players count.
Unsurpassed classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Outstanding Euro, slightly better than Agricola and Puerto Rico imo, perhaps because of the theme, the complexity is similar. How to balance going to the castle and building other buildings for VP can be tricky, this game certainly influenced Quebec regarding buildings.

RATING: 10
[Played 27 times]

Excellent game featuring almost everything that I like in a game: resource management (workers, money, goods), incremental building (new tiles are progressively more powerful), a "draft" element (you must choose the priority of what you want to pick), strategy (plan ahead), tactic (seize opportunities), no luck (just two random elements during setup, to create a little more variety), several different ways to score (and thus to win), excellent balancement between the various possible styles of play.
The decisions you must take look simple, but often they aren't (since you must choose only one of the many opportunities, considering the immediate gain but also the long-term effects).
A game for gamers due to the several options that must be analyzed each turn, but it probably could be enjoyed by casual players too.
It scales well (more players mean more tension but more downtime: I consider 3 the optimal number, followed by 2 and 4, while 5 isn't as good).
The rulebook is very clear.

Near perfect game.  No clear way to win the game, it offers lots of paths to victory.  A bit of a brain burner for me but very rewarding gameplay.
REVISED: Still think this is a fine game for reasons stated above.  However, having now played the card game offshoot of this game, Caylus Magna Carta, I have to admit that I like the card game better.  It's a bit faster, less analytical, more enjoyable for me.  Others will disagree, but I feel Caylus runs a bit stale after a number of games and so I don't care to go through a whole game of it anymore when the card game will give me all that I like in the board game with less effort, less analyzing, speedier play, etc.

RATING: 10
Excellent resource management euro. So far I like it best with 3-4 players. The 2-hour playing time doesn't matter much and our group can usually finish in less time. The components are rather generic but the only bad thing I can find is how you have to stack the flat circle ones on top of each other, it can be a pain to move the bottom one without causing the entire stack to collapse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a heavy, long, intricate gamer's game that necessitates both strategy and tactics. There are so many ways to earn victory points it is not yet clear what the optimal path to victory is.  Working the castle seems compelling, the King's favor has excellent pay-offs, but there are also other enticing ways to rack up the victory points. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice heavy euro and exactly what I was hoping it would be.  This game involves a lot of plannin.  You need to plan for your current turn as well as turns to come.  There can also be some screwage, though it hasn't really happened during the 2 player games that I have played so far.  The opportunities are there but we haven't taken advantage of them while trying to learn the game.  This deserves it's #11 ranking in my opinion.

When you explain this game to fist time players, watch as their eyes glaze over.  Teaching this is tough, but once you play a round, you will see how easy it is.

Have only played on iOS but it's a great app/great port, so I highly recommend that.

Excellent, but definitely a gamer's game. Good and possibly rather fast with two players, great but longish with more. For the first game, I'd recommend the simplified King's Favor rule given in the rulebook - not because it will shorten the game, but because the real rules provide too many opportunities for backfiring plans.
Played 10+ times.

If this was once a classic, it hasn't aged well. This is the epitome of mechanics over theme, which is how the worker placement genre started. I appreciate it for all that it's done for game development, but it's been outdone by dozens of games that followed.

Definatly not the new PR. Not even close to as "elegant" a game as PR, Power Grid or T&E. Its a top 50 game (on BGG anyway) for sure, maybe even top 20 but not as good as the early hype makes it seem. 

Update.... this is falling towards 3 for me. After 3 plays my desire is not to play this often. The game is 100% tactics and no strategy. There is little interaction between players other than in moving the white disk back to screw people and this only delays the game. 

I am putting this up for trade.

Played it again and I still really didn't like this game.  Too much going on, too many decisions, board's too busy, makes my brain hurt.

I can see why others love this game, but for me it's way too dry.

I've tried to play it a few more times and each time I just get more and more bored. The system is incredibly harsh--one early mistake will take you out of the game. And the decisions are incredibly tactical, meaning that there's nothing really to latch onto if you're out of the running.  And then you have to sit through another hour of manipulating cubes.

Why is this game so great to play? I like games in which you’re building something up; where your constructions help you later in the game. This is true in Caylus for both building houses as gaining favourites from the king.
Each game of Caylus feels really different, simply because houses are being built in a different order, which opens new possibilities very soon or only late in the game. The builder houses function more or less like a modular board that is being laid out due to player actions as the game progresses.
Moreover,  it is nice that you can really adopt several strategies; going for bare points; going for the castle; going for house building; or aiming at large monumentral buildings in the end. All strategies can be maximized by tuning your actions to it, especially when you really focus them  towards one goal. There seems to be no best strategy for all situations. It seems te depend on the number of players and on the order in which the first buildings are being built.

Very strategic game. More difficult to learn than to teach and play.
Jan. 01, 06: After 2 plays (4 and 3 players, from 8 to 8.5).
i agree: no downtime; no AP.
I'm suspecting that with more plays it will turn repetitive. There is no a script to follow (like in Age of Steam).
More cons: there is no tension and before the last third of the game is not so dificcult to know the winner.

He cambaido de opinión: en un prinicpio lo veía muy táctico, porque las estrategias me parecian limitadas. Con más juegos en el cuerpo, advierto que son muchas las posibles vías.
Sin embargo, insisto en que carece de la tensión que hay en juegos tales como Age of Steam o Power Grid. El tercio final puede ser aburrido, porque el líder queda bastante claro y es difícil de alcanzar.
Es como si un jugador acertó con la estrategia y no tuvo inconvenientes, a la mitad del juego se ve que su curva es ascendente e imparable, por lo que extrapolar el resultado es bastante fácil.

RATING: 4.5
2-5p. 120 m.  Too long for my tastes, and with such little player-interaction, it can really drag.  I've only played once, and hope to never play again.  I was roundly trounced by the more experienced players, who were concentrating so hard on deciding their next move that they didn't notice a few of my moves were pointless/illegal.  There are so many choices in this game, that it would take several plays to become familiar with all the various building tiles.  But I can't be bothered to squint at the tiny symbols when there are funner/shorter games in abundance.  Power Grid is far superior in so many ways for me.  Caylus has zero randomness, which makes it less fun for me, but others might like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As compared to Magna Carta, Caylus is longer but deeper and the board gives it a more epic feel.  Magna Carta is shorter and tighter, but I can't help but think that something is missing. A virtual tie.

August 28, 2007: tentative rating of 8.  I like the mechanics and varied strategy of this game, though I'm still trying to "get" it.  I'm certain that once I think I do "get" it, I'll realize there are still strategies that never occurred to me.

Interesting 'drafting'/worker placement game. I don't like the type of interaction in this game though and I especially dislike this is yet another medieval resource / victory point game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really decent game, which brought forward the mechanic of options opening up as the game progresses.  Biggest problem is that there are some optimal routes to success and once known it's easy to spot what people are up to and block them.  So perhaps little replay value.  Remains to be seen...

One of the founding fathers (if not THE founding father) of the worker placement genre. Highly enjoyable game, with sound theme, nice esthetics, and excellent (interacting) mechanics. Not too fond of the "monument" grey building types, though.

This one is harsh for newbies, and a lot of things to remember, if you want to be good. Very tense game. I prefer more players, as it feels more challenging. While playing 2-3 is test of counting and knowledge.
P.S. I don't mind multiplayer chaos and there are better 2 player games - see Go, lighter way HoS or more race Antiquity.

This one is pretty much everything everybody here says it is. It is kind of a mishmash of mechanics and ideas, and it probably is (at four-plus players) about 15-20 minutes too long for what it is.

But it's also offers a deep and compelling experience. Well worth having.

This is possibly one of the funniest table top experiences of my life: after a few turns I was in a sort of limbo, laughing, I couldn't believe that was happening. Moving wooden pieces, working, totally incapable of understanding what was going on. A game devoid of any sort of appeal or whatsoever fun.

An interesting eurogame based on worker placement. It can be complex at first but it gets interesting after a few plays. The game can be somewhat harsh as there is not much interaction between the players, beyond the competition on the working spots.

Its iOS app is not very good, but it's playable.

Another really solid heavier euro.  We definitely prefer Puerto Rico as a family.  And we haven't been playing this at all.  Last time I played the game was really quite dull.  Downgraded to a 7.  This will probably continue to drop.  Turning into a no decision kind of game.  Not enough replayability for my interests.

Probable sell/trade

I liked how locations are activated in sequence, and even though the game felt fairly open strategically, there was always stiff competition for worker spaces. The provost didn't make a big impact on the game I played, but the interaction was still fairly high for a WP game. I enjoyed it for the most part, but it also felt a little long for what it was and I feel no strong inclination to play it again.

I can see why this game is popular, but it's not for me, at least not yet.  Played on game with 5 people, all fairly new.  The game was interesting to be sure, but not one that really trigger that urge to play it again that I get with other new games.

Pros
- interesting mechanics with the bailiff (source of all of our player interaction.
- most actions are fairly intuitive.

Cons.
- No excitement.  We played it as a series of micro efficiency plays.  Afterward there was exactly one play that folks could point to as fun.  (a spirited debate on whether or not to collectively screw the leader with the bailiff.
- Long play with lots of downtime between turns.  Clearly this is a reflection of the number and newness of the players, but this will not be an uncommon situation for our group.
- Too hard to plan ahead.  Playing with five, it was too difficult to do anything but react.  The board is completely different between moves.  I think that I would enjoy this more with fewer players.

Final note.  If I knew that we'd be playing this a lot, then it will likely go up in ratings.  The play time would drop and the appreciation for the subtlties of the strategy would go up.  As it stands, I do not see this likely since the barrier to entry and dryness of play is too high.

This rating is based on 2 player games only. I have yet to try it with more. The wife and I have only been playing "nice" so far. That is, we aren't moving the provost back and forth to screw the other out of their action. I can see this game getting very cutthroat with more players, and more aggressive play. That's a good thing.

This is no doubt an exceptional game. In particular, I appreciate how well it plays with 2. Unfortunately, it is really really DRY! The game definitely rewards multiple plays since you have to learn the various buildings. Realistically, you are looking at 5+ plays to have a good grasp. For me, there's just other games that I would rather bring out instead.  

Update 7/5/15:

I can't really understand how novice gamers enjoy this game. Caylus is ridiculously tight and unforgiving. This is of particular importance in remembering to have resources before you build AND making sure that you have met the appropriate steps in order to build. However, once you understand the importance of activation order and timing, you can really start to appreciate how clean and beautifully designed this game is. As a seasoned gamer now, I really appreciate this. It's interesting how much more I like it now (so much more). It's just a superb game. The only down side (sort of) is that it is still really dry. It does help to have the Collectors edition though, with the beautiful art and nice components. Overall, I like some of it's "knock-offs" more--like Lords of Waterdeep. But, I still like this game, and if I have 2 hours and I'm in the mood for something brain-burning, this will be near the top of the list.

This is a good game. Heavier than most recently released games. I appreciate how it is well designed,  but nothing in the game grabs me and makes me want to play it. I think it would help if it played in 90 minutes instead of 2-3 hours. A game needs to have very absorbing play to make that much time fly by. Caylus doesn't engage me to that extent.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I greatly enjoy this game. The multi-phased turn keeps everyone playing with little down time.  Each game plays quite a bit differently since the order of the optional buildings and the timing of the quarry and the lawyer drastically affect the flow of the game.   Less players seems to drive the provost out in front of the bailiff more often than with more players which shortens the game and gives it a less of a 'take that' feel.  I've had games where delivering batches to the castle was very important and I've had others where building buildings was the path to victory. 

Great game that I'd play over Puerto Rico in a heartbeat.  

Recently pulled this out and you know...I don't think it gets much better than this. I sincerely love this game.

Played this twice both times there where 2 players that had played many times which led to myself and the other newbie to being crushed. I don't care so much about the loosing part but the fact that it seemed both times there was really only 1 strong strategy that if you pull it off you win. And if you play against a experienced player you are most likely going to loose. But I would try this game again on a level playing field it might change my rating.

RATING: 8.7
Often referred to as the "grandfather" of worker placement games, how could Caylus possibly contend with modern worker placement games? The answer most certainly involves player interaction, which Caylus unabashedly utilizes as a central mechanic. Many of your decisions will be a direct affront on your enemies, which is to say that Caylus is an extremely cutthroat, albeit rewarding Eurogame. As well or better than any mind-melting worker placement game, Caylus forces you to think your decisions through with thorough scrutiny, and makes you pay if you fail to do so. Masochists need not reconsider; pick Caylus up today!

Fun, tight game with tough decisions and tension. Can get a little conflict with the provost. Though there is start up tile variation between games, it really plays the same every time, so that hurts. It also takes a long time and has AP problems. I like the variety of building and the owner benefit concept. And the variety of ways to earn points and advance is nice too. The theme falls flat for me though (no surprise in a Euro though). I like the money management and scoring rounds as well. 

There’s a lot to like here, but theme transparency and length of time hurt this quite a bit. Hard to get new players involved.

Un clásico, elegante como pocos, que jugado a dos o tres jugadores se convierte en un auténtico placer. Quizá el único defecto que tiene es que un jugador novato va a ser arrasado por jugadores expertos. Esto pasa en muchos juegos, especialmente en los que no hay azar, como es el caso.

La edición Deluxe pierde algo en jugabilidad pero en mi opinión es mucho más bonita y las ilustraciones también tienen un estilo más medieval. Además, jugar con las monedas metálicas y hacerlas sonar para decir "puedo mover al preboste" mola un montón.

Si te gustan los euros y los juegos con cero azar, Caylus es un obligatorio.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Very reminiscent of Puerto Rico but with more 'screw your neighbor' aspects. A very enjoyable game. 

My only complaint is that it seems that there are certain buildings that are more powerful the game may be subject to one particular strategy that can always win. I'd have to play it more to know for sure though :)

Lastly, as the game progresses, more options become available therefore slowing the game down (more to analyze). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in certain playgroups, I could see playtime slowing to a crawl.

It's a good game, but it's too fiddly and a bit too long for what it is to be the 2nd coming that it's been made out to be.  As with Puerto Rico, if people went back and honestly reevaluated this game a year later, I have a feeling that the score would slip down to a more reasonable 7.5 or so.  That didn't happen with Puerto Rico, though, because not enough people go back to re-rate games, so it's unlikely to happen to Caylus.  The eight games currently under Puerto Rico and Caylus are all superior efforts.

Follow up comment: Check out how many of those who've rated the game a 9 or 10 have all these qualifying statements or acknowledgements of flaws in the design, but rate it highly anyway.  Hype factor or what?  Not clear what's going on here...

An open information sequential resolution worker placement/action selection game- which I would normally by wary of, but Caylus has a nice 'take that' mechanism that sees players spending resources to restrict the number of actions resolved post-selection. Few other subsequent worker placement games replicated this facet (Carson City, perhaps excepted). For me it's what sets it apart from other similar games. 

Scales well from 2-4 players, 5 is a bit chaotic. I have had some truly memorable games of this that have been cut throat and down to the wire.

Excellent game.  I've played several times now and have already seen several different ways to lose!  :-)  Seriously, there a number of different strategies and that makes for a good cerebral game about agonizing over your next move.

One of the best worker placement games I've ever played, and still I don't think that I've played it enough to really rate and review it. I love the variable ending point, I love the risk/reward elements, Caylus is a worker placement game with a really nice added element of player interaction.

Previously played one game with 5.
4 of us never played, so with the rule explanation it took more than 4 hours.
I seems to be the only one who actually enjoyed the experience.
Not right away, because I found the game to be way too long, but several days later I was still thinking about the game mechanics and how I should have done differently to win the game.(This is usually a very good sign I will enjoy the game on the long term). I've eared this game is good with any number of players, so I don't expect it to last as long with 4, 3 or 2. So I got a copy in trade for Maka Bana. I will need to do another game or two before rating it.

UPDATE: I played a two players game yesterday. Some good stuff from the game like moving the provost and order of play lose it's fun with two players. Including the explanation, we stopped the game after two hours without finishing it, so even with only two players it takes a while. On the good side, the game didn't look like the one I played previously, because of the building we chose first.
Great potential for a game, but you really need some time to play it. Would rate it a 9.5 if it would play faster.

Good with 2 players
Best with 3 players
OK with 4 players
Unplayable with 5 players

I don't subscribe to the hype that is being created around Caylus at the moment. It is nothing to rave about really. There is virtually no interaction and I am also missing the funfactor. It is a solid well balanced game, a good design. However, the long playtime makes me further downgrade this one now, after the third play. For a three hour game I am more critical: it really has to be full of fun and interaction. Powergrid, Princes of the Renaissance and Tahuantinsuyu for example pass the test, this one doesn't.

Classic worker placement game. I enjoy the theme of this one and the way it plays out is satisfying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Deserving of a solid "3" (it used to be a solid "7" but subsequent play has downrated it).

Interaction seems to revolve around doing something before someone else, mainly a race to get 2 particular buildings so that you don't pay for their use and other people who want to use that building pay you & then the game moves on. It would seem that other games such as Le Havre use this same mechanic, which makes them just as boring.

With strangers I would not play a game like this, because I'd get bored quickly, but with friends (most of my friends seem to rate the game highly), you can at least make some jokes while the tedium of the game stretches on.

RATING: 5
Worker placement game where the placement mechanics is of a flavour similar to Agricola's. Has a slight degree of direct player interaction in that you can spend resources on thwarting or foiling your opponents placements. Well balanced and smooth mechanics. Not engrossing at all and boring as hell in spite of its aesthetics and competent design.

Rating based on one play with 4 players.  The game is beautiful, very nicely designed, and I really, really want to like it more.  But it's too long for what it is - the payoff is too small for the time invested.  If I were in the mood for this type of game, I would rather play Puerto Rico or Goa, or even better, both Puerto Rico AND Goa in the same amount of time that it takes for one game of Caylus.  I would be happy to try it again to see if it moves along faster and would then happily update my rating.

Update: After playing Caylus Magna Carta and enjoying it a lot despite it's length, I think I should try Caylus again.  Maybe it was a bad day or something.

New in collection april 07.
Initial rating after 1 play: since I like these kind of "various paths to victory" eurogames (Puerto Rico, Goa etc.), this one will definitely get more gameplay if I find enough players I can guide to all the various rules (without showing them the butt-ugly boxcover). 

After 3 plays: mmm, not so great as I thought it would be. Okay game though.

Update march 2015: sold it. Didn't have any intention to revisit this. To me it has become 'just another euro'.

NL: Caylus is zo'n spel waarbij je elke keer weer meer keuzes zou willen maken dan je mag. En je hebt altijd te weinig geld. Zoals er zoveel spellen zijn.

I can see the appeal and I appreciate that this inspired a whole new mechanism genre, but this one just doesn't click with me for some reason.  I'm willing to play it, but I doubt I'll ever go looking for a game of this.  It's tight and balanced, offers several ways to work towards points, encourages multiple plays and different strategies, and even allows for some decent player interaction.  It's certainly a deserving classic, it's just not for me.

Caylus is a game that continues to impress.  We've been playing the game long enough that there is no longer any novelty, and yet every game is not merely satisfying, but genuinely memorable.  Yes, it can be stressful, and its unforgiving nature can make it traumatic to play at times, but this remains one of the most impressive and rewarding games in our possession.

Favorite Variants:

Gate activates any open space immediately when the gate is resolved.

Cube track gives 2 benefits each time it is activated (can't choose same benefit twice with the same favor). 

for example, if you are on the 1st spot and activate, you move to the 2nd spot. You can then activate the 1st AND 2nd benefit. 

if you are on the 0 spot and move to the 1st spot, you only get 1 benefit since you can't activate the 1st spot twice.

RATING: 5
Surprisingly positive experience, but I'd expected it to loathe it. Reading the rules it is anthesis to much of what I enjoy the most in games - A hodgepodge of mechanics with gears protruding from the ugly brown framework, nothing is cleanly derived from some overarching principle or idea, everything is just numbers camouflaged by differently coloured cubes. 

However, it has a nasty streak and is not filled with excess like other games in the vein. It's sparse, restrained and works a lot better than the rules suggest. Runs smooth even. Some will not enjoy the added screwage, the lack of anything resembling theme, or the fact that you're not "building something" like you do in Agricola, but I enjoy the meanness of it and the relative simplicity of it's various subsystems. The only thing that will take time for players to familiarise themselves with the building-mix, without which I think it'll bog down quickly as players have to look them up over and over again. This makes it better for me than other games in this category.

I like this game but it seems that the end of the game comes too soon.  Even if we were deliberately slowing down the baliff so that we could build all the buildings, it wasn't happening.  This seems to be one of the few Euros were you can actively mess with someone.

Unfortunately, my gaming group doesn't like this game.

Update: added a half point after a very competitive game with 3 relatively experienced players.Will play only 3 or 4 players. 2 is OK but quite a different game. 5 player lasts too long and can get annoying with one wrong player.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Compete to get different cubes (resources), use cubes to  build different stuff, different stuff gives points in different ways, most points win!

Played as: 3 player

Pros: Took a basic worker placement mechanic and added a twist to make it interactive. Even the most basic strategy takes a fair amount of careful planning and forethought. There's not too many games that I feel every minute of the two hours or so it takes to play is both important but also fun... this is one.

Cons: Man is this a brain-burner. Every little cube seems so important, I have a tough time keeping track of it all in my head. It's hard not getting a serious case of analysis paralysis. I guess this could be a pro too.

Other: I was borderline on thinking I had it rated a little high as a 9. After I tried Goa, it was enough to take this down a notch. It, Goa, just felt so similar, but more forgiving in the 'Am I sure I got this figured exact?' category.

Best Use: For three people looking to burn their brains for a couple hours.

I avoided Caylus when it came out. I heard it was a heavy, complex game and I found the artwork dark and off-putting. I did try to read the rules, got completely confused and it was years before I picked it up.

I'm glad that I did! It can be cut-throat,but it's not a heavy game at all - I love how fluid the game is, and I love that here are many ways to win. Even though I'm still not a fan of the artwork I do appreciate how functional and intuitive it is.

After ~2 plays.  I *should* like it.  It's perfect information, and deep.  But it also feels arbitrary.  You get points for this, you get points for that.  Why?  Who knows?  Not me.  One caveat: if I studied this game, in order to get skilled at it, I'm quite sure I would end up liking it alot.  I like deep things that I can study, but only after I've studied them.  There's not nearly enough initial appeal here for me to do that.

Caylus seems to be a well balanced and complex game system, but to me it provided no fun. It's basically a bunch of rules tied together with pretty much no theme, which makes it very dry. It has a feel similar to Puerto Rico (which I'm also not a huge fan of, but at least the moves make somewhat more sense and it plays quickly) in that you have to have a long term plan and know exactly what all the pieces do and exactly which move to take when and exactly how to react to moves other people have made. It seems to take many plays to really grasp a good strategy and get a feel for the system, but I'm just not motivated to play anymore 2-3hrs session that I won't enjoy. I can definitely see how some people may like it a lot, but it's just not my kind of game.

Decided to get it after all, mainly based on reviews.  After a 2-player game, we are favorably inclined towards the game.  Very well-designed board (although not pretty) and peices make playing very intuitive.  Too bad the money coins are so plain.  Some tough choices and interesting gameplay kept us rivited, and I expect the game to maintain some excitement.  A nice effort.  Also enjoyed my 3-player trial.  Takes about 2 hours.

It's outstanding, but it's not quite as earth shaking as many have made it out to be. It's long, and it can have some downtime, which is not a good combination. It seems that usually it will be quite engaging with little downtime, but the length detracts. Above and beyond that, there's a nicely interlocking set of mechanisms, but nothing amazingly clever or revolutionary. It's a very well done resource management game with some novelty in the mechanisms. A definite buy, but it's not Puerto Rico. Even with experienced players, it's going to take 100-150 minutes, maybe more.

Only problem I can see is playing the game with players prone to PA, as there is no hidden information in the game.

A multi-faceted game with various routes to victory & an overall great design.  There's area control, resources, building, action/role selection, etc. I suspect the group you play will heavily influence what type of game it becomes. It could be a screw your neighbor negotiation game (moving the provost, paying attention to what your opponents are going for & beating them to it).  The number of players also changes the game (it's much tighter and danger lurks with 5 compared to 3).  

Beware of min-maxers, there's a lot going on.  The bottom line is, and I've said this before, you have to be flexible with this one.  Long-term stategies are good but you're going to be forced into a lot of tactical decisions.  

UPDATE: moved rating down .75 points.  I'm just not as excited about this & it's a long game.  It's an uber-euro that's as tough as your opponent's are bright.

*Oct 2013* After one game, on BGA, against a friend (2p game, also a newb), both of us were absolutely captivated by this masterpiece and are itching to play it again.

The only downside is it's a game that needs to be played repeatedly by the same group, but it absolutely deserves its place amongst the upper echelons of the BGG rankings. I thought it would feel old and dated with all the new innovations and such introduced since 2005..... how wrong I was. Glad I took a chance on purchasing this and can't wait to play it again!

**** UPDATE SEPT 2009 ****

caylus has aged pretty well considering the absolute slew of worker placement derivatives that have appeared since launch.  i still dislike a bit of the way that the favor tracks operate and i have some hang-ups about the premium buildings, but it is still really good. 

i have had two poor caylus playing experiences and they soured my taste a bit.  one, was a 5 player slogging that just did not work and really drug along (this seems to be true for most worker placement games).  the other, was a simple 3 player, but one AP player ensured that this went 60+ minutes too long.  

initial plays, will seem to take a bit too long, but i encourage to give it another couple of plays before giving up on the game.

******

2 player has become a bit less satisfying as it seems that the actual paths to victory are reduced to manipulating the building track.  there is just not enough other ways to offset those potential points in a 2p game.

Update Sep2016:  Revisited this comment on Caylus (due an opportunity to play again after all this time), but can't quite figure out specifically why I reduced the rating from an initial rating of "7" down to a "5".  Which is another reason why I should probably use update notes like this one more often...

Anyways, my previous comments regarding the length of play and the mostly opportunistic/tactical nature of most of the decision making are probably the main reasons.  

I don't mind tactical decision making in games , if it is in turn supported by some other game elements, like strong thematic immersion and a game narrative (e.g. wargames, ameritrash, some multi-player strategy games), or offset by a shorter playing time, characteristics which Caylus does not possesses. 

So, it stays at a "5".

--------------------------

Only one play so far (3 players).  Enjoyed the game, but it was long (2.5 hrs).  Seems to be alot of variety/options/paths in attaining VPs.  Don't think I'd play with more than 4 due to concerns regarding game length.

Like many euros, a very weak connection between the theme and game mechanics.  Addicting (for a first time player) in that there seem to be a variety of different strategies that can be pursued. But, some of the endgame buildings really don't seem balanced. 

Analytical, opportunistic/tactical gameplay with some room for longterm planning (maybe... need to play more).

RATING: 9
So much to do, sooo little time.

Played this game several times, and I love it.  I find that no two games play the same, and even the number of players changes the strategy and means of winning.  With two players, there is more to do then there are workers.  With more, you run out of choices before workers.  AP hasn't been a problem I have encountered, yet.

RATING: 9.5
Definitely all it's hyped to be.  With 2 or 3 players, this game is incredibly deep and interesting.  It becomes more chaotic and political with more players, which in my mind is a bad thing.  Nonetheless, it is a legitimate contender for the top overall spot here and in your collection.

In 2006 I wrote: Incredible good game. Downside is its length of play (though while playing you don't note the time).

Since then we harly played Caylus anymore. This is partly due to Caylus Magna Carta, and partly due to the fact that we now seem to prefer lighter games with a touch-of-luck.

Great game with many balanced ways to win.  Nice components too.  Only caveat is that by the end of long games (usually with 4+) people, I'm always a bit zonked out.  This may not be a problem with plays where everyone involved has played Caylus a few times.

My expectations for Caylus were all over the place. I had mostly decided I would find it dry and spreadsheety. I played it mostly to cross it off my bucket list, to appreciate the forerunner of so many other games I enjoy. But I loved it! I pondered alternative moves and strategies for days afterward. I want to play again.

For my second play, I had wanted to employ a new strategy, but backed off to plan B after another player jumped on it. This strategy won me the game and I find I still want to try plan A. And plan C. And probably more. There is a lot of exploration left in this game.

Oh boy! I love this game. The game sounded interesting from the offset, but my interest really peaked when BSW released it's java-version and I had a chance to try it out. After many plays on BSW and several f2f I have to say that this it top notch. A 10 for me!

The interaction in the game is what it is all about. You really have to keep tabs on what your opponents might do and plan accordingly. Perfect information games are sweet!

I have an inexplicable attraction to this game. My rational mind tells me it is a dull cube-farming game with one moderately inventive mechanic (the provost). But ...  mustt  ... haveve ... cubbbbbeeeeezzzzzz!

This game is like Chess, but with complicated rules. Sure, you can say about any perfect information game that it's like Chess, but Caylus is also like Chess in that one wrong move leads to disaster if your opponent knows how to exploit it. If you have trouble in Chess with making mistakes that cost you the game, imagine how much harder it is with 10 times the rules to keep track of, any of which can be exploited against you.

I like games with lots of rules, but where a big mistake can be made up for by a preponderance of better play for the rest of the game.

RATING: 8.25
Played once as a two-player game.  A tremendously thought-intensive game that requires an insane mix of strategy (much to plan and ponder before you even put down your first piece) and tactics (each area on the board can only be occupied by 1 player per turn, so you're often blocked from doing what you want).  The game is complicated, but the board is exquisitely designed and thus makes the game easy to keep up with once you've started.  

As I've heard from other people, it seems like the game is likely best with either 2 or 3 people; I thoroughly enjoyed it as a 2 player game.  I'm a wee bit concerned that player experience-level will dictate the outcome, as there is absolutely no random component to the game at all (except deciding who starts).  

Definitely a game on-par with Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, and other great games.

Update: after something like 2 or 3 years, I've now finally played it a second time.  I played with four players, and we finished the game in 2.5 hours (not including rules and setup); it was quite enjoyable, and good brain exercise.  Very nice!

RATING: 10
Play as master builders in charge of building the castle and town of Caylus. Players place workers and build buildings to produce and obtain various resources, favors, money, and other items to earn prestige points. It’s a massive resource game where you must remain flexible based on other player’s choices. 

After hearing all the hype on this game I have to say it lives up to the promise! Although seemingly complex at first, game play is intuitive and easy to pick up. The design itself is superb and most everything you need to reference is either on the pieces or the board itself. It is a little hard to explain as there are lots and lots of things to do. New players may feel a little lost at first but will soon find that the game gels pretty quickly after a couple of rounds. Also, it’s one of the few games with perfect information and multiple paths to victory, which is always a good hallmark for deep complex strategies. It doesn’t seem to be prone to too much analysis paralysis from players, especially from this type of game. Very highly recommended and a must for fans of “Puerto Rico” and “Louis XIV.”

Game feels like all kind of things are added one by one to make it work and balanced, without a polishing job afterwards. Missing any sense of elegance. All kind of different interlocking subsystems, take one of these systems not into account and you can get screwed hard time or you give the game away. Only for die hard gamers who want to scan the rulebook over and over again for the first few games and dont care to make a lot of (not even close to) suboptimal moves.

BUT the game works and is tense. Although I would never buy it because it is that hard to teach.

Caylus es un juego con unas reglas bastante densas y cuya redacción, no muy acertada, puede llegar a echar para atras a mas de uno. Cada ronda se compone de 7 fases cada una con una seríe de características propias. La cantidad de acciones, el orden de ejecución, las excepciones, las características y tipologia de los edificios, los favores reales, la construcción del castillo, el preboste, pueden abrumar en una primera aproximación. Tras un par de rondas toda esa información es asimilada y la sensación de saturación de mecánicas desaparece.

An excellent example of the usual can't-do-everything-you-want-to-on-your-turn mechanic.  Resource management elements, but feels more integrated with the theme than Goa or St. Petersberg.

A very long game by our standards, but even in a 5 player game, there is very little downtime; so it feels much shorter than it is.

Very smooth and well-designed worker placement.  LOTS of depth, resources are tight, many tough decisions... Can induce a little bit of AP, but not as much as some other games in this genre.  Can be a little mean with the provost-dude, but that depends on the group- if you play knowing that that can happen, it throws an element of risk in, and if you get slapped around because of it, it was your fault.  Either way, I'm still not a fan of the mean-streak.  Otherwise a stupendous game!

RATING: 8.5
Nagyon jól megszerkesztett játék, változatos, érdekes mechanizmusokkal, nagyon jól súlyozva. Kezdőknek nem ajánlott, tehát nem egy belépőszint.

Jó ötlet benne (amit azóta már többek közt az Agricolában is megcsinált Rosenberg), hogy a játék elején még csak néhány épület van, korlátozott akció lehetőséggel, viszont ahogy építkeznek a játékosok, egyre több és több variációs lehetőségük van a győzelmi pontok gyűjtésére.

Egy bajom van vele: a témája nem szippantott be, így meg elég absztrakt érzése van tőle az embernek.

Ennek ellenére napjainkban is az egyik legjobb stratégiai játéknak tekinthető, bár kétségkívül repül az idő felette és eljön majd az az év is, amikor egyszer sem kerül elő.

RATING: 9
Pretty alright game with many overlapping and co-mingling mechanisms that offers up many, many ways to seek victory...Players must both think ahead as well as be tactically flexible following \every player's move...A bit strange to grasp at first, perhaps stranger to teach...but once a round of Caylus is played, you might be hooked----at least for a while!


With the wrong group or with 5 players this game can get tedious.  I enjoy it best with 3 and 4 and with people who are not prone to AP.

<<update>> at this point many have jumped ship on caylus.  I'm not quite there yet.  Still enjoy it when it hits the table, but that could very well be due to not having played the shit out of it.

We're big Agricola fans, we really need to try this one. 

I finally sat down and simulated a 2p game on my own. As usual, the rules were much less intimidating during gameplay than when reading the rulebook. I feel confident that we can (finally) sit down and try this.

We have played a couple of 2p games of Caylus. It still feels a little tough to grasp, but we like it so far. The provost adds a little nasty to the game.

Multiplayer chess? Almost, but the starting position of the initial buildings can significantly affect the game.

Excellent game, but I feel it's so close in theme and execution to Keythedral (which I own), that I no longer feel a great desire to own this.

Update: my original rating of "9" was adjusted downwards to "6". Why? The first game played was with two others who were also learning. The second game was with one experienced player, and 3 learners. I realize now that this game is overwhelmingly hard to learn on your first play; this degrades it for me, as it seems I'm always playing games with at least one player who's never played that game. Games that are this difficult mean (a) every game will be a struggle to shepherd the newbie through the maze, and (b) lots of newbies won't be back. In our second game (at a con), two newbies dropped out about 45 minutes from the end to go do something else. That's not an endorsement.

There are numerous things about this game that drove me mad on second play. The bingo-chip money. The hundreds of information "bits" on the board. The constantly changing turn order (we made at least a dozen errors of playing out of turn). The activation order based on the winding road (several players booted their entire turn because they misinterpreted which building would activate first). The provost mechanic which introduces a very cheap "screw-you!" factor. I'm just not motivated to play this one again.

Very cool game. Play was tight, and movements meaningful. I love games that give you so many ways to possible victory. Will be intersting to see what kind of winning strategies will emerge over time. Definite A-game

RATING: 8
Complex yet intuitive. Plenty to think about, and lots of different strategies to try. The iconography and rules are excellent. The provost was mostly just a threat that encouraged sticking to early buildings in my first game -- only once did the provost prevent someone's worker from activating. Like Agricola, felt like a friendly competition (which is perhaps odd, given this one's reputation for being mean).

This game shows it's age: it is dry and drab, but also tight and challenging. Understanding the economy of the game requires multiple plays.  It is still a very good euro, but in an age of beautiful, engaging designs it is hard to get players excited about this.

Woh. I did'nt understand how to play that one so I hated played that game. I found it dry, did'nt understand the theme it could have been anything. I found it soooo loooooong and boring.I see why people love it and find it clever, but.. but.. but I'll never play it again.Fortunatly the guy who teach us that game at CarnageCon 07 and the other players were really nice peoples. That is the positive side :)

I LOVE this game. With enough plays you get pretty fast at it but it is brutal on new players. Even still, around half way or two-thirds through the game the new players always GET it. Although it's too late to turn things completely around, they always have fun.

Low on ramdomness, takes time to master and you really need to take into account the other players and bash them from time to time to achieve victory. Simple rules but the depth of gameplay and the multitude of choices may seem even overwhelming at first.

RATING: 8
Perfect information and minimally different setups (it's rare that the ordering of the first 6 buildings actually makes a huge difference in strategy or outcome) means this is a strange mix of solvable logical/economic puzzle and arm-wrestling match. Still, a remarkable game. It's easy for one or two players to be out of the running midway through the game, and that can suck the air out of the provost mechanism if they lose interest in trying to win or just decide to mess with the leader.

Probably has been bettered by later worker placement games, but still worth playing. BGA has a decent implementation though playing turn-based with sluggish players is NOT recommended, a single game can drag on for months.

Good old Caylus, I have not seen nothing that has top it yet. While there are many other good and great worker placements, nothing has been as elegant with a yet highly complex decision making element as Caylus. The provost is great, do you try to push your advantage? Or out bluff everyone else?

Don't play with 5 though unless everyone knows how to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the mechanics and theme of Caylus but the various strategic and the constant review of calculations of options make it feel more like tedious work than fun. I can't help but feel that each session has about 4-5 rounds too many, especially in the end game. Doesn't get on the table much with gamers I know but I like to play it occasionally. Hugely prone to analysis paralysis blowing out the play time ad increasing waiting player's boredom. Movement of the provost seems to bring out bitterness and angst among gamers I've played with, too, but I think players should just accept the risk of placing workers so near the provost and plan accordingly. The iOS version of Caylus makes it much more playable because it takes out all annoying and repetitive administration from the game, and I only rate Caylus a 7.5 on that basis.

Well, time surely hasn't been kind to Caylus. This used to be one of my favourite games, but revisiting it in 2015 was a disappointment. Sure, it's still an ok worker-placement game which requires good timing and some messing with the other players' plans, but a certain dryness and even some boredom has set in. Basically no luck involved. The turns feel awfully boring, I didn't care about what I did anymore, especially if you compare it to other more modern worker-placement games like Tzolk'in, Castles of Burgundy or even Lords of Waterdeep, which I guess kind of streamlined the core idea & added some cool flavour. Very cut-throat, which appeals to some players. Or maybe I just had a bad day.

12/19/10 Comment:  Played my 6th game and still no win :(  Doesn't matter, still a very good game.  I just need to adjust my strategy based on what I see other's doing.  Glad I own this title.

Update:  I'll leave my original comments below.  I have a more favorable opinion of this game now for 2 reasons.
1) I've read the rules my self, and buildings make more sense to me now that I understand their usage.
2) I've played both Agricola & Le Havre and both of these have way more options to evaluate than Caylus, causing AP.  Thus I prefer Caylus to both of these.

Old Comments:
Good game.  Lots of strategy.  Even though I enjoy this worker placement game, I find it a bit overcomplicated.

This game has a little too many bits & pieces.  By default I take a point away from games that require continuously referencing the instructions to understand the building types available and their powers.  Puerto Rico falls into this category, and now so does Agricola & Le Havre.

This bogs the game down and causes AP even in non-AP players, because there are too many things to evaluate.

I prefer Pillars of the Earth.

I have barely scratched the surface of this deep, long-term planning game. Although diplomacy is important a significant part of the challenge is to 'beat the system'. Thus this game lends itself to a more friendly, non-confrontational playing style as well.

Definitely feels like a classic game, but I do think that Caylus has been outdone at this point. Lords of Waterdeep and Tzolk'in cover a lot of the same ground, and I find both to be more engaging. Caylus is one of those WP games that feels like a cube pusher, but still elicits fun. If I had no other games of this genre in my collection, Caylus would be one that I'd be very happy to own. The money is very tight, it moves along at a good pace, and the sense of progression is definitely there. It just feels a little too redundant returning to this design at this point in time.

This is a great game, and I'd like to play more. It's got lot's of decisions for you to make each round, a bit of a conflict factor through the provost, and multiple routes to victory. The game (in my experience) plays fairly quickly too. Scales really well from 2 to 5.

We've played this more recently with 'harder' game players and it really is excellent. We're Ag. fans, and though that's a firm favourite of ours, and partly inspired by Caylus (we played Caylus first) we love playing this devilish predecessor - needs the right players though. Ones prepared to play tough.

Acquired: Sept 25, 2007 new
This game is just incrediable!!!!  Object is to set out workers to gain resources (food, wood, stone, cloth, and gold) and denier (money) in order to build a castle and earn the king's favor....which are bonuses (either prestine points (vp's), money, resources, or to build building).  The game has got a great "screw your neighbor" aspect to it.  It plays great with 2 players, and goes up to 5.  I don't know if it's my best game (at this point on 9/25/07 it's El Grande) but right now it's got to be my favorite.

Plus it's a mega-dry mega-heavy euro and you might know the position I've developed about those over time. From the little I've understood, nothing much here outside the usual worker placement schtick with a timer/availability gimmick in the form of the provost and bailiff.

Learning that this is somewhat of a closed system game and once you get down the system, it loses it's interest.  Downgrading three notches after repeated play.  Many paths to victory and quite a brain-burner at times.  Best when played quickly without over analyzing.  You can change your strategy mid-game easily and still come back.  I like that aspect.  Still too long for what it is and too repetitive to rate higher than this.  Prefer Leonardo da Vinci or Pillars of the Earth to this game.  Now that Stone Age came out I am downgrading Caylus one notch further....it has lost my interest due to the time factor and repetitiveness.....

Best thinking-game I own.

Nothing is really determined by pure chance.

Several mechanics to victory, and even more to annoy the other people at the table.
It has a tendency to be a lot meaner than most games I own, especially since it can take a while to finish.

Components are nice, though not great.

Bumped down a point since the start. I've come to appreciate a bit of chance in a game over almost fully deterministic games.

The rulebook wasn't easy to follow, but by the end of the first game understood most of the rules and by the end of the second had mastered them.  Rulebook aside it is a great game, better with more than two players because the starting player becomes more critical.

After a couple of plays, still intriguing. Probably too long, but interestingly balanced between tactical and strategic.

Another play...sliding down...I don't think I'm really totally getting it yet. I can see that 2 or 3 more plays will make things gel in my mind, but I don't know if I have it in me to play this 2 or 3 more times.

UPDATE
I think the problem for me is this just ends up being too long for a euro for my own personal tastes. A good game, but just too long (for a euro).

Caylus is a good game, and it deserves credit for popularizing (if not creating) the worker placement style of game.  But it has come to pass that there are better worker placement games out there, and Caylus doesn't get played much because of it.  Agricola offers more variety and replay becuase of the cards, and if I want something quicker, Tribune does a good job of filling that spot.

Caylus has provided some good experiences, but it is a long game that feels long.  That means it doesn't see the table, and with improvements to the system, it's become a bit of a relic.  Solid, but no longer great.

Worker placement game.

This one starts off a little slow - resources are difficult to come by.  There are enough choices to keep this one interesting.  It may take a little too long for what you are getting out of the game - my impression of a 5 player game - but I would play the game anytime.

Solid worker placement game - but there could be better ones out there.  Theme and board art are a little blah.  Good game though.

Very Good. Good game, very well designed. This one MUST be played with equally experienced players to take the fun out of it. It gets better after more plays. After playing Agricola, I don't see myself asking for this game to hit the table again.

RATING: 8
Overall comment: Complex game with complex rules, once it is played through a couple of times then the strategy presents itself. Game has a plodding feel to it sometimes with many moves that are almost automatic. Advanced players cripple newbies which puts off replayability with new players.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor): 8 (pieces were interesting but the board seemed rather plain)
Family: 7 (rarely requested - wife will not touch it)
Game Group: 9 (want to play it often unless time is tight - requests have fallen off due to online play by the group players)
AP: 6 (occassionally game play gets hung up)
Solo play: 8.5 (has a high replay factor and helps to balance the game between the money, resources and victory points, the multiple paths to victory still exist and the SoloPlay version has rekindled the interest in this game)

When purchased: 2006
Recommend expansions: none available
Age range: 10+
Luck factor (1-10high): 1

Reason purchased: Geek and friend's recommendation

Pros: a "no luck" game with many easy-complicated decisions, play is quick with experienced players but games usually last 2 hours, different paths to victories are apparent, close scoring.
Cons: same game everytime, chess-like mechanics have developed now that everyone is experienced in the play, while different paths to victory are possible(it seems that only a couple actually work), programmed moves that if not taken will put a player behind quickly and catching up is difficult

Recommendation: it is tough not to recommend this game even given the cons, it is very good. It can be played by the casual gamer as well as the experienced one and still be fun. My kids, when they are into it, can play it very well and it is probably the most fun way to play now. The pros are too serious and do not want to employ variants to mix up the gameplay.
Replay rating: Moderate
Game value(play/cost ratio): Average (SoloPlay has raised the rating to average and possibly above-average)

I like it a lot, but no one else I play games with does. I predict that Agricola is going to entirely replace this one, even though they are quite different. 

UPDATE: From 7 to 6. I just realized I'm almost definitely never going to play this game again. It isn't terrible, and in fact is a very high quality game. But it isn't exactly... fun. The theme is somewhat uninviting. There are just better games. 

UPDATE: Realizing that no other game is quite like this, and it deserves better. Back to 7.

In 13th century France, one attempts to aid in the construction of Caylus by erecting buildings, or help in the construction of the castle. Speed of the game is regulated by the movement of the bailiff, and which buildings get activated depends on the provost, who can be "bribed". Players put workers in turn order on different buildings to activate that building's special ability. There is a lot of interaction, strategy with placing workers to change turn order, earn money, etc. There is a royal favor section, 4 tracks of improvements for VPs, money, goods or building, where one can work on strategy. It is a long game, at about two and a half hours length. There are a multitude of strategies, and will vary with the number of players you play with. The manoeuvering of the provost does add a screw factor to the game, which can be cruel on beginners. 

This is the game that introduces the worker placement mechanic, so it is innovative. It's a bit longer than I would like, and I am lukewarm on this game, but I am in the minority here on BGG since most people really like this game.

Caylus is the ultimate worker placement game.  2 and 3 player games are excellent.  4 and 5 player games are so chaotic.  

BSW is a great online source to get in games of Caylus regularly.  Face to face is still more intense in my opinion.

Very much appreciate that this game inspired my most-played game ever, Agricola. I find it quite interesting in its own right, with the provost a nice little extra wrinkle, but most of the time would pick Agricola/Caverna over it.

Clever worker placement game with the ability to block players from getting the benefits of their spaces if they get too aggressive. I like it best as a two player game where provost control really comes to the forefront. I don't find the theme/art particularly compelling and other worker placement games have largely replaced this one for me.

The game that launched worker-placement games into Geek orbit.

Plays well with 2, have yet to try with 3. With 4 players seemed too long, probably better with experienced players, or with a game timer.

Some say it's dry, but I don't see it that way at all. The theme works. I've enjoyed this one quite a bit and I like the aggressive play.

Have played my BiL's copy numerous times and, for a time, was a bit legendary for winning the first 2-3 games (I'm not always a strong contender in our gaming group and shocked them by winning games in a row). Love that there are multiple ways to win this game and will definitely be picking up a copy for myself.

RATING: 5
I have only played twice. The first time I got stomped and the second time I raced the provost to get the game over quickly while building the castle to prevent getting stomped but still came in second. The rules seem to change on you as soon as you get a handle on what is going on, it is very unforgiving game for little mistakes or oversights, and there are quite a few gotchas that experience players can pull on you, like building up an econ to go from dead last to first and then outstripping your score by far. 

I would like to learn this game more to get into it but since it is really hard to learn and my group doesn't play often enough, Caylus will likely be starved of the needed play time for me to get to a level where I enjoy it.

May be I overrated this game. I played it a lot of times with my girlfriend and we had a lot of fun with this typicle eurostyle strategic gamers game. This 2 player game is very fixed now. So we do not play this game with 2 person anymore. But I never played it with more than 2 person and I think it will be a different game with a compeltly other feeling. So I give this game 10 point for a good 2 player game till the actual point and the potantial 3-5 game I've never played...

Lots of interaction, which I like. There are a lot of little levers to move over and over again. But the game does seem to drive some of the people I play with crazy, so probably too much interaction for their tastes. I'm not sure if I like the five player game, probably just four and down.

My players love this game a lot and want always play it. This is a classical worker placement, with a lot of tension and interesting decision. Tactical and strategical (strategies come after several plays cause it's important to understand mecanisms first). It demands a time of explications at the beginning but after that all is writing on the board.

RATING: 6
I like the mechanics of the game.  How the houses grow out from the village and bigger and better ones become available, but then the game is coming to a close.  It is a typical euro, in the sense that it is cube farming.  Gather cubes, then trade them in (build batchs), but this doesn't mean the game isn't fun.  In fact, I like it.  However, there is one cavaet that gets me.  The time.  This game is a long one for the fun factor involved.  It's not that I won't say no to this game when offered up, but at the same time I'm going to be personally thinking that for the fun offered we could be playing another game that isn't nearly so lengthly.

RATING: 9
Initial rating is based on one play with four players - I suspect this may well end up a 9. I'm not normally enamored by the "do this, to get this, to pay for that, to do the other" type of resource management gameplay that is certainly present here, but for whatever reason it all seems very manageable and interesting in Caylus. I think it may be due to the clever way that things are timed - it makes following the path to your goals a bit easier to follow, at least for me.

I found the rule book very hard to grasp and once we started playing (after more than an hour of rule learning) realized that I could explain the game in less than 10 minutes. I'm not deducting any points because of it, but take this as a warning not to get discouraged - all will make sense once you get going.

Just bought it (2nd printing)!  This game is awesome and the group I played it with just fell in love with it.  In otherwords, it's a hit.

The game mechanics are not overly complex, but there's a lot of strategy in placing your workers, gathering resources, building new building, and just trying to get those royal favors.  It's a deep game.  The components are also of high quality.  Larger print for the rules booklet would have been greatly appreciated.  Some sort of reference chart for the buildings would have also been great.  Neither one of those shortcomings ruins this game though.

Was looking for a good 2 player game to play with my wife.  There was a lot of hype around this game, but it just fell flat for me.  The set-up is too long and the game play is too long as well.  Never got into it.  I think the game is a little too heavy for my taste.

RATING: 10
In late 2007 early 2008, I rate this as the BEST of board gaming.  It is Puerto Rico plus.  The pinnacle of euro-gaming.  Complicated to master, yet simple to play.  There is a beauty to the game.  Each game, depending on the players strategies, creates a Caylus that could range from orange resource driven structures to magnificent blue asthetic structures.  Like life, the personalities and competitive motivations of those around you, creates the world we live in. One player's strategy allows another player to achieve their respective strategy. The basis of John Nash's "non-cooperative equilibria" from the film a "Beautiful Mind" is captured in this game.  This is board game nirvana.  My friends, we're home!

RATING: 2
Was ready to buy the game and was scared about the hype. Got a chance to finally play and.. well, I liked it. I'm sure that the 7 will rise quickly with more plays. My only personal problem is finding the right group to play, as my immidiate group is more inclined for Ticket to Ride or Carcassone.

**Update**
Played for my second time. I think it is a fun game. However, after my second play it seems like you really can be locked out of doing what you want easily by those who know what they are doing. In my game, I was consistantly in second or third the whole way through. I kept watching 2 of the players mass tons of resources and money, wondering how they were doing it while I was sitting there struggling every turn. Because of that, and because I really feel that you need to have a group of similarly skilled players to have a good challenging game, I've actually lowered my rating.

RATING: 6
I can see what the hype is about, but game length is an issue.  Replayability will be there for a while by virtue of the fact that it is impossible to see the different paths the game can go without at least a half dozen plays.--update--Rating of 8 is confirmed upon additional playings.  Length of play goes down with experience, but there is actually a touch less depth here than appears at first blush.--update--Definitely sticking at 8.  There's perhaps even less depth here than I thought - the game is mostly about shooting for a strategy with the occasional tactical maneuvering for position to pull it off.  That being the case, the breadth of avenues a given game can take keeps the rating relatively high.

---update---
Caylus Magna Carta has exposed how bloated Caylus really is.  Hanging at 8 for now, but I wouldn't be shocked if it drops to a 7 in the end.  

--update--
As promised, down to 7.  Though there is no denying that the extras present in Caylus that are not in Magna Carta do make the game more complex and add some depth, the amount gained isn't worth the added complexity IMO.  I am so much happier with Magna Carta.

Caylus has all the worst trappings of an early Euro game:

1) Opaque name that conjures up no image in the mind (turns out Caylus is a place, so it has that Euro stereotype too)

2) Bland, characterless art design. People in my gaming group passed on playing Caylus because it looks so ugly and boring. Glad the publisher changed the cover art on the box because the old one was terrible. If I'd known there was a Limited Edition version with all new art that makes the game look like an illuminated manuscript I would have bought it instead of buying the regular version, although the new imagery might be too dense to be easily decipherable for new players.

3) Medieval setting that doesn't involve knights in combat. Now this might just be the gripe of someone from outside Europe because the only thing we know about the Middle/Dark ages is that there were knights and crusades. Perhaps its a limitation in our education, but take a hint: Knights are cool. Use them or risk losing an international audience.

I'm not gonna add resource management, worker placement, and points for victory into the list. Yes, those are Euro stereotypes that some people hate, but that is why I bought Caylus. I wanted a deep game with those qualities.

Also, not sure if everyone's copy is like this, but the component quality is terrible. Misshapen houses, cubes with splinters of wood sticking out of them, cubes that were stuck together; just poorly crafted wooden parts.

This game is flat-out overrated. There are so many better games out there, let alone better Euros. What a disappointment!

With only one play, game seemed to drag a bit.  Has a fair amount of depth, which I like.  Wish there was more options, felt like the castle was a little to much of a fight in terms of options with lots of points.  An expansion would be a welcome addition: tax collector, etc.

You need a reference for all the buildings for the first few turns, as the pictures are not very different for alot of them. Also it is interesting that is is not so visiable as to what you own or build for the duration of the game, but what you can achieve for the round, which makes more sence of the scoring track for me.

There's a lot going on in Caylus, and yet it all coheres so well. The exemplar of the worker placement genre, perhaps of the eurogame itself. Incredibly balanced, arcked, replayable. Given its reputation and age, it is surprising how many people don't know this game, at least in the various gaming groups I've been a part of. 

[color=#117bc0][b]Probably rather play:[/b][/color] very few games, actually. Maybe Agricola or Le Havre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
First things first: Avoid Caylus like the devil if you've got AP or play with those that do.  It will annihilate any sense of fun this game has to offer -- my rating drops to 4.5 with AP and/or players who do not actively participate in the road clearing.

Second: Man, this is not the game to drop on your in-laws over Thanksgiving.  This is a no-luck, open-info resource management cubefest.  There are several tactical choices to be made on any given round, and part of the strategy is developing a path that keeps you from being blocked in should the inevitable provost-fights tighten up the game flow.  Also, gameplay with 2 players is radically different than with 5 players; it's amazing the first time you try your small group tactics and see that they have NO CHANCE of working in a 5-player hootenanny.  Even more than a Rosenberg.

It's safe to call me an AT fan.  Maybe not a zealot, but a fan.  And Caylus has got me hooked.  So many ways to play, so many ways to win/lose.  If you rave about Agricola and can't find something good about Caylus, I call shenanigans.

2017 UPDATE: After nearly a decade, Caylus is about as perfect as it gets for me.

The original worker placement. The fixed order of effects is not very common in WP games nowadays, but it works very well here. There is a lot of blocking and the provost adds a very nasty layer.

I'm not really a fan of WP, but this is one of the best ones (I prefer Le Havre, but that does not really have the WP feel). It seems to take very long in real life, although I'm not sure why this should be so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Our first game ended in an unpleasant kingmaker situation. Using the  provost, the game could basically be clinched for one person. This seems a bit too powerful since those with no hope of winning can basically choose to give the game to one person. Hopefully this is not common.

Second game: Five players. I decided to try a castle heavy strategy. I made an effort to be the first in the castle each turn, and to get two or more houses in each time. I picked up 6-7 favors from the castle, which was a great deal of VPs. I only won by a single point, so while it is a viable strategy, I don't think it's invincible. It really seems like this is a game where you have to play a strategy; you can't just react to what everyone else is doing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Lots of mechanics but after few rounds they seem intuitive. There are many ways to get points and they seem to be quite balanced. My only (minor) complain about the game is that you get points from so many little things. You almost constantly have to be moving pointmarkers around the board and it's virtually impossible to notice if you forget to do it. 

Always a pleasure to play and every game is different enough thanks to changing layout of the buildings on the road. Simply an excellent game!

RATING: 7.5
One of my first 'Euro' loves; the interlocking mechanics, multiple paths to victory, and opportunities to screw over your opponents make this one a great deal of fun; but on the other hand, it seems to outstay its welcome, and some of the alleged paths to victory seem like shiny dead ends. I'll still play, though I'd rather play other games at this point in my 'gaming career'.

Superb artwork (special edition) only matched by the depth and the level of strategy hidden inside this game. Last game I´ve seen some newcomers (never played a board game more complex than monopoly) surprised and progresivly mesmerized by the elegance and the multiple possibilities that Caylus can offer. A must have for anyone who loves strategic-economical challenges.

This is a Top 10 game? It is heavy. But it is also a pain to play and not at all fun. The more experienced player will win. Always. Not only will he win, he will destroy the less experienced ones, and often gloat as he does so. 
My other complaint about this one is that there is not enough "game" there. Yes, you are doing stuff but, just like running on a treadmill, you are not getting anywhere and being exhausted in the process. 
Caylus Magna Carta does a much better job in implemented these ideas and making an enjoyable game out of all of this.

Definitely a favorite. Plays completely differently with two players than with three players, but either one makes for a fantastically strategic game. It's a shame that multiple players also tend to make it a bit longer a game than seems necessary.

Uno de los juegos mÃƒÂ¡s "heavies" a que he jugado nunca. Reglas complicadillas, muchas cosas por hacer y duraciÃƒÂ³n bastante larga de las partidas. Pero me fascina enormemente! Siempre lo estan comparando con Puerto Rico pero yo no lo veo tan parecido a parte de que los dos sean alemanes. Eso sÃ­Â­, por su complejidad, es un juego a jugar de vez en cuando ya que sueles acabar una partida con bastante dolor de cabeza. Para muy, muy jugones.

This is a dry game and takes too long to play for what it is. When it comes to mechanics there is nothing wrong with this game really. It is just that I am not a big fan of resource management games. Agricola is the game I though Caylus would be.

A good "heavy" Euro. Contains clever mechanisms, which mesh well together to create a complex and absorbing game. Much to consider each turn with both short and long term aims to bear in mind, including those of the other players. A much imitated game.

A lack of narrative or coherent theme stops this being a great game. (8.5)

RATING: 5
Not my type of game: it takes too to play; the analysis paralysis factor can be painful;  it's easy to fall behind, and there can definitely be kingmaking at the endgame.  I don't consider it a horrible game, just one that I would really need to be convinced to play again (hence my "5" rating.)

RATING: 10
While the topic doesn't strike as anything innovative (a castle being built among all players on the board, striving for the most prestige), Caylus is as memorable as it can be - I don't know any other game that gets twelve pages of rules (written in a transparent, concise style) to work in such a smooth way. This succeds mainly due to two big factors: 
* A rather long turn sequence where all the usual layers in German games are concerned (prestige, resources, money, buildings, turn order, bonuses) flies by with hardly any downtime. The usual recipe against waiting in between turns (having players taking small steps at a time) is carried out to great effect here since players have got to manage the placement of workers (it's not for free) and the range of options for them increases throughout the game.
* The board is designed in such a way that almost half of the sequence can be followed intuitively, and the rest can be easily repeated after a couple of rounds of play (not even a full game). 

As if the smoothness wasn't enough, Caylus boasts another unique feature: the duration of the game is limited to a maximum of rounds depending on the level of aggression the players want to achieve (this allowing a lot of nasty play).

Caylus is an iron fist in a silk glove: a game with staggering tactical richness, room for strategy and no trivial way to win. It manages to match the already incredible balance of complexity and playability of Puerto Rico: Caylus is not as sleek, but it offers even more substance without building on the same mechanisms. An absolute masterpiece and still today the measuring bar of worker placement games.

E' come quando si attende con impazienza l'uscita di un film del regista preferito, o il libro dell'autore prediletto. Insomma io Caylus lo tenevo lì, in attesa; tutti me ne parlavano bene, ottimi voti sui siti specializzati e quindi la mia acquolina in bocca aumentava. Dopo qualche partita a Florenza con gli avversari che facevano paragoni con questo giocone, non ce l'ho più fatta: eccomi! Ammetto che dopo la prima partita sono rimasto un tantino deluso, ho trovato l'ambientazione poco accattivante e le meccaniche poco originali (forse perché ho visto prima giochi che in realtà potrebbero essere usciti dopo Caylus). Rigiocandolo successivamente diverse volte però ha cominciato a conquistarmi e ho trovato diversi pregi quali l'assenza del fattore aleatorio e le molteplici strategie per giungere alla vittoria finale. Nel complesso lo trovo un gioco solido che si apprende bene solo giocandolo più volte, ma rimango dell'opinione (non condivisa da nessuno dei miei compagni di giochi) che il già citato Florenza sià più bello, soprattutto per ambientazione e atmosfere.

RATING: 8.5
A bit of a short life-span with two, but Caylus has an elegant and natural mechanic and features the key re-visit element: many possible routes to victory. The need to continuously re-evaluate your strategy on the fly is not that far removed from chess. It's hardly a pretty piece of work, but there are few flaws and the game's status is secure as the quintessential Eurogame to many people. The Royal Favour track can be a little unbalanced with an experienced crowd, but that only adds to the strategy.

Further Thoughts: I just don't enjoy getting this one off the shelf any more. Still a quality game, but the fun is going out of it. Downgraded from 9 to 8.

RATING: 9.9
Caylus is the Granddaddy of Worker Placement games and one I encourage anyone who is likes, or is even mildly interested in, that genre to experience at least once. If not a couple of times.

Compared to the other worker placement games, Caylus is pretty pure in its mechanics, as there is not much more to it than the tactical placement of worker tokens. Yes, there are some strategic elements revolving around whether to pursue favors (you generally need to) and which favor tracks to pursue (developing your strategy), and there are the occasional brinksmanship decisions when building castle components or when moving the provost, but the bulk of the time and the decisions are where to place your workers. 

As I categorize action selection mechanisms, Caylus has: 
* Player-directed, dynamic action set - players build the additional actions
* Multiple, sequential open selection for personal actions – openly place multiple workers, one-at-a-time, in turn order for your own use
* Exclusive usage – no one else can use the selected action
* Conflict resolution is moot - only one player can place on an action slot.
* Pay per placement – pay as you place, as opposed to per worker, or per activation mechanisms
* Post-placement resolution – resolve after all placements, not as you place (like Agricola)
* Player-driven, uncertain activation – through player movement of the Provost, not all actions will activate
* Certain action value

This game plays much heavier than other worker placement games like Stone Age because the VP conversion values of actions is not as straight forward as it is in the lighter games. But if you like worker placement games and want something heavier, this is the game to try.

While it plays anywhere from 2-5 players, Caylus gameplay changes dramatically based on the number of players. I recommend this game with 2-3 players. 2-player is zero-sum, so there are a lot of options to deny your opponent rather than to push your own agenda. 3- and 4-player games are enjoyable and emphasize taking your own path, which changes viability of many strategies, but it can run long with 4. I don’t enjoy the 5-player game because it becomes too chaotic, and it’s difficult to adopt a strategy; control just goes out the window.

Caylus is among the best in the worker placement genre. It's deep without being overly complex. There are multiple paths to victory and these are often influenced by what everyone else is doing, forcing tactical decisions while building around a larger overall strategy. The board state will also change from game to game making Caylus highly replayable.

RATING: 8
I love just about every aspect of this game. The pure mechanics, the variety, and the competitive nature. The only downside is the inability for someone to mount a comeback. Very small complaint, really for how great this game is. 12/15/2013

Verdict:

What I Like: Besides initial turn order, this game has zero luck. This means gamestate is always a product of the players collective choices. Even so, it is rare for two games to feel alike or flow similarly because the initial tiles players build drastically change what is possible/beneficial during the rest of the game. Everything is smooth as well in that it's relatively intuitive and I feel no hard edges or clunky rules while playing. This is a battle of minds and therefore winning and losing can never be attributed to anything other than the wits of the players themselves.

What I Don't Like: The mechanical levers, though interesting from a competitive standpoint, aren't enthralling from a mental one. Sometimes I feel the player who just performs adequately and effectively blocks their opponents ambitious big point grabs has the distinct upper hand all the while avoiding creativity themself, but if everyone plays this defensive style the game suffers tremendously from tedium.

Not really sure what to say.
One of the other players summed up my thoughts when he said, "He couldn't see any clear strategic play, that was the difference between winning & losing.".
I have Pillars of the Earth & Stone Age in the cupboard & I'm guessing that they will see more table time, but would like to have one more go of Caylus to be able to make a final decision.

I'm a recent convert to this. I've played it a few times and I don't think I've fully explored the possibilities and interactions yet but it has obvious parallels to Puerto Rico. Even less theme but, perhaps due to its freshness, currently more appeal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A little dry for my tastes and slightly too much AP from the ever expanding decision set. The mechanics are good but the theme seems somewhat arbitrary, dare I say 'pasted on'? 

This is a very 'Euro' Euro, i.e. you push wooden cubes around so you can 'kiss some noble's ass' more efficiently.

However Caylus offers plenty of tactical decisions that require your full attention and some long term decisions, provided you are happy accepting the game for what it is - an abstract VP/economic engine game. 

Caylus is one of those games like PR where you need to already know the strengths and weaknesses of all the buildings before you buy one, so you have to put in some real work to learn the game before you can fully enjoy it.

I find the game drags towards the end (especially with 4-5 players). I don't find worker placement an interesting mechanic will resist playing. Functional but boring.

This is a game I highly enjoy playing despite its mathiness. Since there's so little chance in the game (choosing starting player & placement of starting tiles being the only random elements) this game really is a gamers game.


Something that bothers me about caylus is the setup time, cleanup time and the fiddliness during gameplay. I own a physical copy of this game but I actually prefer to play Caylus online (e.g. on Brettspielwelt.de) because gametime is shortened dramatically, even more so than for other board games that have been digitalized. A two player game takes no more than 30 minutes, on average 20 minutes online. Offline Caylus takes easily 2-3 times as long.

Only get caylus if you have regular gaming buddies who aren't prone to analysis paralysis and don't burn out on you after repeated plays. Caylus really isn't one of those games that you play once a year. It's much more like Chess, Go and other abstract games, where certain strategies become obvious only after repeated plays.

The advantage of Caylus over Chess (besides just generelly being a better and deeper game) is of course, that it can be played with more than two players. Having gaming buddies that will play this with you about once a week or so, must be heaven.

A fantastic game. A very complex game system that demands highest attention from players. Analyse not only your possibilities but also those of your opponents. Many different variables to be taken into calculation... A fantastic and absolutely rewarding experience. One of the best games ever.

- The rules are well written. But due the complex nature of the game, it would be wise to simulate a few round while you read the rules. Once done it's not difficult to explain the game, tough to master though! This is a game for advanced players!

I love the game. Wife loves the game, but only on BSW! I buy this nice board game and she would rather play online. I have to admit the lack of set up and the BSW version doing all calculation instantly is very tempting. Our last game took just over 2 hours on BSW. With the board game, I'd estimate double the time. This is enough to scare my wife away from the board game version. She also doesn't like games that clutter up the coffee table.  Now I have mixed feeling about this purchase. On one hand, I'm glad my wife likes it enough to ask to play it, and she usually NEVER asks to play anything, but on the other, I'd like to play with the full board game version. 

Update: After 3 online games, we are finally getting the details. Very enjoyable. Lots of strategy options, and moves fast enough with very little downtime. Each game we are getting faster, shaving off 20 minutes with every new game.

RATING: 8.5
This game seems to me to be sort of a hybrid, combining the resource management and interdependent roles of Puerto Rico with the worker allocation and constantly developing board of Agricola. It's not too tough to teach (15 minutes or so should do it), but it's insanely layered, and it can be frustratingly difficult to find your stride, so much so that new players might feel as though they're being taken advantage of. This game is heavy on strategy, and luck very rarely factors in. Note to super-competitive types-- Playing too aggressively can easily produce disappointing results. The game seems to favor long-term strategy over short-term sniping. A great game, better with 4 or 5.

Tenemos la versión nueva de este juego que compramos junto con unas monedas de cobre y plata gratis, el detalle de las monedas nos gusta bastante, porque mientras piensa la jugada... el ruido es maravillo jejejeje. 
Este eurog es muy bueno. Y esta versión nos encanta por el acabado de los dibujos, a pesar de que haya gente que no le gusta el nuevo tablero por sus colores oscuros, creo que gana bastante.

Can be frustrating with a lot of opportunities to block each other.

Played it again for the first time in a couple of years, and it was fun, but the limited edition is dark and gloomy, and the graphical design makes it more difficult to see details, not to mention colors of cubes (both the actual cubes, and in print).

First Euro style game I've bought and its a good one. Tremendous balance and I like the lack of randomization. Having everything in plain view without hidden hands means all the advantages are in your mind. Having trouble finding people to play this game as my most reliable (game obsessive) friends are more into theme based games so thats the only reason I have rated this so low...

  This is probably the best of heavy eurogames I played. It is a true brainburner but it offers more different paths to victory than Puerto Rico, Power Grid and Tigris & Euphrates. This is true gamers game. Unfortunatly Caylus also have some serious flaws. Since Caylus is very heavy game it is difficult to introduce it casual gamers, even those who liked Tigris & Euphrates or Puerto Rico. Another flaw is the time that must be spent to go through the whole thing. Even 2-players games often run about 1,5 - 2 h. That`s because realy high amount of time needed to find out the best possible move. So the most patient player counting endlessly possible strategies is ussualy used to win. 

Edit: The more I play heavy games the less I desire to play Caylus. I prefer Puerto Rico and Tigris & Euphrates.

I really like Caylus, it's one of those games that everything fits together perfectly, there's ton of options that can lead you to victory and the game is not as complex as it looks, once you play a couple of turns everything makes perfect sense.

I don't rank it higher because sometimes games can last a lot more then what they should and you really have to know the buildings to get the most of it.

Fantastic game.

In my first few plays the game has me thrown around and I made beginners mistakes, but at the same time I wanted to play again.

This is one of the best games of 2005, without a doubt. If you like Puerto Rico, Goa and Princes of Florence, this game is for you. And don't be turned off by the instructions, which even though they are very well done, it is hard to remember what each building does even after two reads. The only problem is that it can cause a lot of downtime, so some games can drag. Although it is one of my favorite 2 player games, which has all the strategy and none of the downtime.

Un gran sistema di gioco con meccaniche raffinatissime. Così tante cose da fare (costruire, produrre, ottenere favori, mettere bastoni tra le ruote) e così pochi soldi! Grandissima interazione tra giocatori, sia direttamente che indirettamente (agendo sul "dinamico duo" balivo-prevosto). Uno dei migliori giochi del 2005, e in assoluto una pietra miliare. Per raggiungere la vittoria, il fattore esperienza è più importante di altri giochi: è praticamente impossibile vincere contro un giocatore più navigato. Veste grafica sotto la media, per quel poco che conta.

I really don't care for this game. It is not that it is a bad game. I just don't like it. I really like some of the mechanics and the fact that the design brings very little luck into the game. It is however one of those games that has so many choices to chose from that it may as well be random. This is magnified of course, by having another player at the table that is going for the same stratagy as you as there is often only one chance to gain a benifit and when another player takes it, you've lost your chance. Think of something else to do. The game is a little too long as well. Nope, don't like it.

RATING: 8
Heavy Euro-style game based on building a city in medieval France.  There are a number of strategies to score victory points, but they are very well balanced against one another.  Lots of interesting decisions on whether you want to build the castle, build auxiliary buildings, gain favor directly, collect resources, or amass money.  Dynamically changing turn order works very well.  Game may be too heavy for some gamers, as there is a lot going on.

(5+ plays)

RATING: 8.5
A very good strategic game with a worker placement/action mechanic similar to games like Agricola. A great deal of thought and planning is required to succeed at this game, and the rules surrounding the provost can lead to careless players having their entire game plan ruined! A game I'm always keen to play, and which any keen gamer will find satisfying (although the depth is sometimes a turn-off for lighter gamers).

[Also own iOS version.] First play (4 players): 2.5 hours. Second play, online BSW (4 players): 2 hours. Third play (2 players), 3 hours!!! This game is LONGGGGG. Too Long. Update: I rate this a 5, which is being generous based on time investment required. I can think of some many games in my collection that I'd rather play with the time invested. I do like the box, the colors, the pieces, the rules are fine. I will never introduce it, and will play it with my friends only when they request (and only one of them probably will). I'd much rather invest the time teaching folks to play PR, Eclipse, etc. 

2014: I kind of hate this game. I am terrible at it for one thing, but I think I hate it much more because my best friend loves it, and always wants to play it. Thankfully, we BOTH love Agricola, and it's our first choice generally. I hate Caylus because it takes him from other games that we should play when we are not playing Agricola - Twilight Struggle, Race for the Galaxy, Innovation, Impulse, Uchronia, and a bunch of newer games that are BETTER than Caylus, which is IMPORTANT to the hobby, I know. I know. Ryan Sturm, fine, yes, it's a good game (not really), yeah yea, Caylabration, blah blah.

Simple enough rules, although there is a bit of rules overhead until you just start and learn from there. After a round or two, people get the flow of the game. There is a significant amount of strategy and quite a few ways to win, all viable and all a counter to each one. This game can be incredibly cutthroat with certain people which can be a negative depending on what you want out of it. Just a solid worker placement that still astounds me every time I play. Such a deep and smooth playing game.

Only 2 cons for me is I like the road track better in regular edition and I like that the tiles are easier to read in the basic game.

The Holy Grail of worker placement games, with direct player interaction through the mean provost. Despite having a static setup (apart from the neutral buildings) each game turns out different.

I usually get bored with boardgames, because in the end they are quite trivial. This game is far from being trivial. The game has almost everything: mechanics allows you to be nasty, you should constantly take other players moves in to account, there are multiple ways to achieve VPs, there is only a little random factors (beside other players), it can be played with different strategies...

The only thing that worries me is how to find people to play this with me. Well, that is not to say that the game is flawed but that the people in general are.

Excellent game for 3, good for 2 or 4, and not worth playing with 5.  There's alot of planning that requires having a good idea of what *might* be available when your turn comes back, and with more players, that becomes less likely.

The first few times you play this game it'll probably take 2-3 hours, leaning towards the 3 hour mark.  After a few games, you should be able to get it down around the 2 hour mark.

The time flies by which makes the length less of a deterrent.  An excellent game with no luck.

There's no real originality in any part of this game: it looks like a good mix of 20 years of good management games. Although this may look as a negative comment, it's really not. Caylus is very easy and quick to understand and to play, much more then its ancient progenitors from whom it took the ideas. Its strategy is clean since the first play and not obscure for the first n games. The game is quick, the material is good. Maybe the game is overrated, but it definitely must stay among the best ever.

It's really great game. I played it first time some days ago and it was hard. Both with my brother couldn't go trough the first phases. Often looking into rulebook... So the begining wasn't to good for it. But 2 days later we played again with my sister too. Don't know how but such pleasent and non-problem play we didn't expect. In two days!! Concluding ... 2 days played after me and my family and we want more. But because of the end of Easter we must wait to meet again...

It's a resource optimization game but without the infamous "snowball" effect. The available options increase as the players build their buildings. It's a real no luck brain burner, perfect for those, like me, who enjoy these types of games. It's really deeper than the ocean.

The sole worker placement game I'd pick to stand in for the whole genre. Thematically superb in many ways: Pay a worker to work. Pay to get workers to work earlier, then you'll reap the benefit of first choice on resources but you'll have less jingle to spend on more workers. Fewer workers out there in workplace at large because another player's workers are done for the day? Then you'll have to pay more to put one of your own to work. Someone wants to use my building, then fine, pay me a point. Getting too ambitious? Be careful then, a bribed Provost just might shut down your building. A masterful game that rewards focused and repeated play.

Has (of course) more in it than Magna Carta. Many try to explain Magna Carta's superiority with it's playing speed, but I disagree: 2h with 3 players is a good time if the game is playable. And in this case, it's almost more than that!

In the first game probably everything confuses and alternatives are neverending, but it'll get better. Even though this game is prone to mistakes, they usually hurt you so little that there is no significant in-game need to whine about the newbie-status!

King's favour is a great bonus-system and incentive to various deeds; Moving the provost is as mean a way to interact with others as usual; Turn order is cleverly build, as everybody can claim the 1st place - just by being the first in corresponding area.

One thing that bothered me was 
the lack of resources in game. Well ok, it's good to the replayability that all the buildings don't get built, but still, it's sometimes quite a rush to the production buildings...

In my case, I'll be willing to play this a lot more. But not with more than 3 players. Finding time to play this can be hard, but definitely worth it.

(Caylus was my 250th rated game.)

This game might have lots of interesting mechanisms, interesting decisions etc...
But it is boring.
Every turn you have to consider every possibility, since everything might change between your turns.
There are no long-term strategy to be found.
You might buy a building but that does not hugely improve your possibilities to get to use that building.
If it is good enough someone else will use it.
-> You cannot select a strategy and stickto it a'la Puerto Rico.
Also very dry and slooow game, analysis paralysis incarnate.
All the cubes (except perhaps yellow) are just that, cubes. At the castle there isn't even any difference which cubes you bring as long as you have 3 different once.
This is one of the few games I have bought that I gladly sell or trade.

After staring at the board thinking 'duh?' for the first game, it suddenly clicked and we played the second game like naturals. Deceptively simple gameplay leads to many possibilities of strategy. Absolutely love this game and have played it more than any other. Plays great with two and is gf/wife friendly if you don't use the provost too much.   

Bumped this up to a 10 after playing 10+ games, it really is a great game and a triumph of design. This is another game my girlfriend asks me to play, always a good sign.

I've not played this much, but I'm hooked on the app., which has some quite tough AIs, making the five-player game especially difficult. From playing the app, I'm not convinced that castle building is the optimal route to VP, as some claim. There are some optimal builds that it pays to snatch, and there are better routes to dominance. Tho' this game is entirely language-independent, a couple of the tiles in my French version have different illustrations to those in the English version, which is odd.

Another nice worker placement game... this time you are a master builder collecting resources, adding buildings to the village and helping to build the king's castle. This really felt like a cross between Agricola and Neuland to me... both games I enjoyed.

This is my favorite game, if there has to be one. I don't know how much of that is nostalgia, though. I fell in love with Caylus when I first played it, but back then many of the great games I have now played were yet to be discovered.

I also have considered rating this a 9, whereas my other 10, Twilight Imperium is still definitely a 10, so if I wanted to be logical, TI3 should be my favorite game. But I don't.

Why do I like Caylus so much? I still don't know, really. I like the complexity, and I like that you have to keep an eye on what the other players are doing. Most importantly, I really enjoy playing it.


GOOD?             Very.

RATING: 7
A game with a lot of different stuff crammed in it.  A more intense version of worker placement with lots of decisions and little things included in it.  For a new player, it's as close to overwhelming as it gets, as it takes about 3 or 4 games to grasp how best to score and do well.  One also needs to become familiar with the building tiles to see which ones are most popular and useful.

As I told a friend it's kind of a "momentum" game for me.  It never seems quite the right time to play it (esp. if there's a newbie at the table), so I never pick it and sometimes resist it if it's chosen, but once it gets going I'm absorbed with it.

This is my favourite resource management game. What really makes this shine is the different royal favour tracks. They push players to utilize different strategies depending on where they want to be accumulating those favours and I like that strategic element.

Absolutely love this game. It's elegant, well-balanced, and rewards the perfect balance of planning and adaptability. The greatest thing about the game is that it does exactly what it should; rewards you for making the right choices and punishes you for making the wrong ones. I have never lost a game of Caylus that I didn't feel I deserved to lose. There are always so many options available to players at any time, it truly takes experience to get good at this one. Whenever we have a game night, this usually makes it to the table.

Re-rated. I still like this game, but I feel like there are better options out there these days.

This game didn't convince me playing with two players. It felt that after you're behind for 10+ points there's absolutely no way you can catch up to the leader. Looking forward to try it with 3 and 4 players because of the high rating and all the praise the game has.

RATING: 8.5
An absolutely fantastic almost pure strategy worker-placement game. The only random elements in the game are the order of the initial 6 neutral buildings and the initial turn order. Once setup is complete, the game is entirely driven by player actions.

There are multiple effective strategies, so it's not limited in that regard. It also plays differently with two players as opposed to 3 or 4. By that I mean that different paths are viable in a 4 player game that would not be in a 2-player game and vice versa.

The only downside is that there is a lot of administrative upkeep. Points can be scored at a lot of different times during the rounds and there are just a lot of steps to go through for each round. That doesn't make the game take longer than necessary - just means that there is a higher than normal amount of administration necessary.

Caylus.  

Really, I think Caylus is awesome, but that's just me.

For a Euro, it's complicated..  you've got a pile of pieces, tiles, a few fiddly rules and a weird premise.  When you study it, you want to make sure you fully comprehend all of the different 'mini-games' in here.. Resource trading, building, the provost and bailiff, royal favours, castle building.. sections, rounds, .. there's alot going on.

But you know, after a few rounds of Caylus, it all makes sense. The game becomes intuitive and gameplay can move fairly quickly.. provided you aren't prone to analysis paralysis in the first place.

I've played it with gamers, I've played it with 'curious' non-gamers, and it's always been a hit.  As i'm sat here trying to come up with adjectives, the word 'thickness' comes to mind - whatever that means.  

Anyways, Caylus is a good game.  Caylus is an enganging game.  It is a game that will easily be requested as it's bound to be a  good time.  However, there are some rules to learn and some complex things going on, so you'll want to be sure who you play it with.  This thing ain't everyone's cup of tea.  Seriously, Caylus is the 'Chuck Norris' of boardgames.

Appeared to be a longish game at first, but speed increases greatly with familiarity (with the buildings), especially with only 2 players. Has lots more possible strategies and things to try than I originally expected, and there are loads of ways to interfere with other players' plans.

Very nice components, although the box seems a little too large for the bits and leaves the board sliding around a little.

NOTE: This short version of the rules is a must-have reference, especially for players new to the game:
http://www.ystari.com/caylus/adjE.pdf

WARNING: (Virtual) lack of random elements (leading to learned or pre-determined actions) is a slight worry. Will play become scripted or repetitive? Perhaps Caylus Magna Carta would have been the better choice... but this probably gives the more complete experience.

Too disorganized to be intresting tactically. Way too much waiting time. The only social interaction is trying to ruin others. Play is error prone.

Everything you do is a loss for the others in this game.

First play with 5 went over the two hour mark as we grappled with the round of play structure, which has some novel but fiddly aspects. However, several rounds in, this became second nature and you could focus alittle better on what you should be doing and more importantly, what order. Like Puerto Rico, this is a sequencing of actions style of game to generate vps. I actually prefer this over PR functionwise in that the play is centralised (rather than sprawled and inaccessible), actions are translated into icons (though alittle small and browns and purples clash) which I gradually found self explanatory at a glance, with no ponderous text reading, except with player aids. Playwise this is better in that there is more competition for desired actions and so there is greater tension for me. Will play again, probably with less players. However, I can't see the appeal lasting as there is no random element in each round, except the dry uncertainty of where your opponents will place their workers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2

This is the best game since Puerto Rico in my opinion. A no-luck strategy game with tough and interesting decisions at each turn. Decisions that force you to make a single choice among a wide range of diverse options including turn order, money, resources, buildings, and many others, and even the ability to hinder a couple of your opponents, by moving the Provost and making their last action a wasted move. You have so many choices on each turn that you wish you could choose at least two actions, but you only have one.

The game is also big on money and resource management, making it a well rounded game of both short term tactics as well as long term strategies.

8 is my tentative rating based on a single play, which I enjoyed very much  at BGG.CON, Nov. 3-6, 2005.
Update 12/07/05: Raised my rating from 8 to 8.5. This is for 3-player games. As you add more players, my rating goes down since you lose more and more control.
Update 02/18/06: Raised my rating from 8.5 to 9 (for 2- or 3-player games). For 4-player games my rating is 8 and with 5 it is 7.5.

Need to play Caylus more but hard to find the people and time for it. Really enjoyed the 3 2p games I have played, although if players are not very close in skill it has a runaway leader problem as a 2p. Almost no luck makes this about as fun as chess with players who are better than you. Still I can imagine the randomness of the provost making this better with more. Players can use the provost to rein in any runaway leaders.  Overall a very heavy and well designed strategy game.

Update: Seems to play best at 2-3 players. Really tense worker placement game with nice potential for screw you.

I love it. I picked this one up as a piece of history, as a way to go back and look at how worker placement games got started. I ended up surprised with how modern it felt, and while it can be a bit "point salad-y" at times and be hard to tell what are the better and worse choices, there's always something to do, cubes to collect, and things to build.

The time/game progression tracking system, while convoluted and using strange words like "bailiff" and "provost", is very engaging and rewards understanding your opponents strategy and needs.

I really enjoy this game.  However, towards the end, I find it difficult to lay out my next several moves without error.  Internal monologue: "So, I have these cubes, I need those cubes to turn them into those cubes, then I'll spend some on that... and the rest on that... good!  ... ... ... ~sigh~ I just botched the last turn.  That's no fun."

Good game gone bad?  It starts out great with lots of options on both the strategic and tactical levels but then the options aren't really related to each other using a unifying theme like Puerto Rico has and making it an overload of information and fiddliness.  Of course, this increeases the playing time as everyone struggles to remember all the options available to him/her.  There's just too much work here for too little payoff.

Played early in my Eurogaming life. Having played around 300 unique games in the subsequent three years, I have a much better idea of where Caylus fits in and the factors that make me dislike it and others of its ilk.

- lack of elegance. I like games where the complexity of decisions arises from reasonably simple basic rules and player interactions. Caylus is a convoluted brute, in which it feels like a lot of the complexity had to be put in by hand rather than naturally emerging. For example, the favour table is just a big bolted-on spreadsheet.

- resource conversion. I'm not a big fan of games that involve a lot of cube-juggling to turn one fairly abstract resource into another (nope, didn't like Le Havre at all). In Caylus, I don't really feel the theme gives much of a handle on why I need food to do one thing or cloth to do another, so it feels very dry.

- worker placement. I find this mechanic often leads to samey, flat, linear games in which the main form of interaction is cursing someone for taking the space you really needed to complete your laboriously calculated chain of actions. 

- too much thinking, not enough laughing. The more I play, the more I realise I'm not really a heavy Eurogamer. I like games to be not much more than 90 mins, I like some (manageable) randomness, I like ridiculous things happening that make everyone laugh. I don't like furrowed brows and people looking down at the table calculating how to milk the most efficiency out of a chain of micro-actions. That's not to say I don't like deep games, but I think there is a difference between depth and weight. 

- and finally, generic medieval themes that involve pleasing an authority figure and/or/by building a castle/cathedral.

Played this for the first time last night (4 person game). My first thought was "oh crap, another boring, outside scoring track, non interaction Euro game" (actually, this game has some backstabbing and quite a bit of player interaction). My second thought (as I was being explained the rules to this game) was how am I supposed to remember all of this. The rules for Caylus are daunting at first, but once you learn the game they are quite simple. My suggestion to anyone who wants to learn this one is to watch a game being played first. If you just jump in and play, you will more than likely make the same mistakes that I made, which are: when in doubt, go for money; and being overly concerned about turn order. Money and turn order are important, but I needed to amass more supplies for building and for prestige. Another problem with just jumping in is that the game will last forever with a newbie (myself) in play. Our game lasted 3 hours. It was a fun game, but by the end, I was just hoping for the game to be over. I did come in last, so that may have something to do with losing interest. All in all, a fun game that (due to it's length) I will probably play on occassion.

Worked through the (poor) rules with four players. Looks to be an excellent game. Clearly, it's easy to make a small error that will cost you the entire turn and may cost you the game. Players have many decisions as to placement and timing with screwage opportunaities abounding. The cube requirement graphics on the buliding tiles are a bit too small with the similarity on color of wood/cloth. Also, some of the onboard cube reminders etc aren't as totally obvious as might be desired (e.g. the Castle cube 'batch' is Food plus two cubes of different colors whereas the board shows Food plus two 'generic' white cubes.) Players certainly need to review all the tiles beforehand and keep on their toes. Game is much less scripted than Puerto Rico and is clearly superior. This game could go to a 9.

Caylus - the grandfather of all worker placement games and a brilliant Euro. I thoroughly enjoy Caylus - the theme of building a castle and what you do on each turn has a good tie-in, and given that there is no hidden information the game is pretty much all strategy and no luck. Caylus tests your ability to plan ahead, roll with the punches and rewards the one who makes the most optimal move each turn and is a genuine "gamer's game"

While I almost always want to play this game, finding other people who have the time + willingness + ability to learn to play Caylus (playing it well is a different thing) is no mean feat. Even so, I've no regrets about this purchase and expect it to have a long play life.

One of my favorite. A good strategy game with no chance factor involved. Many options to be able to win a game. Tile placement and supervisor and intendant movement mecanisms are well tougth for contoling game time. Plays well at 2 or more although.

November 2007: Lowered my rating from 10 to 9.3 because I think that when you play a 3 player game, there is two main strategy. You can try to get the King's favors or try to built the most buildings. Most of the time, two players are choosing the same strategy leaving the path open for the sole player with the other strategy making the game easier for him. The only way to avoid this is to have a player willing to play on both turfs. 

Un de mes meilleurs jeux. La chance n'est pas un facteur et il existe plusieurs options menant à la victoire. Les méchanismes de placement des tuiles et de déplacement du bailli et de l'intendant sont particulièrement réussis pour le contrôle du jeux. Se joue bien à deux ou plus.

Novembre 2007: J'ai descendu la note pour ce jeu de 10 à 9.3. Ceci est du au fait qu'il y a deux stratégies possibles. Gagner des faveurs du roi ou bâtir des bâtiments. Dans une partie à trois joueurs, souvent deux joueurs vont choisir la même stratégie laissant la porte ouverte au joueur qui a choisi la stratégie opposée ce qui rend la partie plus facile pour ce dernier. La seule façon d'éviter ceci est qu'un des joueurs choisissent de jouer sur les deux terrains.

This can be quite a brain-burner, but I really like it. Easily the best heavyweight of the past couple years. The components are not up to typical Eurogame standards, but Ystari is a small company and can be forgiven for that. A bit fiddly but deep and involvingand therefore worth it.

Caylus is an old classic, and for good reason. It is a very well designed and good game. It is fairly interactive for a heavier Euro and can be flat out mean to players that allow themselves to be put in such positions. Still I love the construction of buildings along a joint path that all players are competing over all while fighting to most efficiently convert resources into victory points in a tense fight. The level of tension and interactivity is not often found in most modern day worker placements and that's a shame as this is a real standout game. 

I play online via the app or on BoardGameArena which has an excellent interface for it as well.

Not very well-written rules, leading to a confused piddling-about first-game and a "what the hell, oh, right" second game, but the game itself is good stuff. Hooray for no random factor or hidden information games that still work and don't feel like a tedious lookahead computer-will-kick-your-arse-at-this game (though I'm sure it could). Also, the fiddling with tokens is a bit of a pain.

Played at GameStorm 2017. I understand the reverence that some people have for this game as pioneering worker placement, but it's still a Eurogame point-salad soulless mess to me, and truly not my style of game. The game seems entirely unbalanced for new players vs. experienced players, so I was trounced. I suspect a second game I will do better, but there are so many other worker placement games out there that feel more refined, as this is already 12 years old.

The question isn't so much as to whether the game is good...it is.  It's whether or not I'd like to spend another 2-3 hours playing it when I could play and finish three shorter games and have just as much fun.  Our first try was four hours long...although, admittedly we botched the rules up pretty good.  I'd have to play again to put a rating on it.

OK, so I played the now seemingly legendary Caylus in April of 06.  It seems like a good game.  However, the curve in learning how to seriously play the game is rather large for what I expected.  There are seemingly many strategies to this game.  No one has figured out the unbeatable strategy yet as far as I am aware of.  The game is somewhat counter-intuitive for myself.   I will have to play a number of times to really get the strategy.  I did come in last place in my first attempt at playing the game.  

Raised to 7.  Played again in 2017.  The game is good.  Real good.

UPDATE: July 2011.

From 3 to 1 after a five player game. Short Euros are barely tolerable. Euros that last more than three hours are inexcusable.

To the credit of my fellow opponents. no one suffered from AP from my last five player game; the game moved at a brisk pace.

---

Direct cross between Keythedral and Puerto Rico.

This is not my kind of game. It lacks the elegance of Keythedral and the thematic richness of Puerto Rico -- Caylus's mechanics do not mesh well with its theme.

I actually don't care much for Keythedral (except that it's quick) and Puerto Rico (except for the fact that newbies can easily grasp the game) -- two other reasons why I don't like Caylus that much.

Initially, the saving grace for this game was the provost mechanic -- I enjoy games that offer the possibility of the "group screw" -- a negotiated attempt to attack a player in the lead. However, in actuality, the opportunity to benefit from screwing over a player with the provost doesn't occur that frequently. 

UPDATE: Traded away to a better home

Pros:
1. First! I believe this was the very first worker placement game. Which means it a bit more simplistic than many of the worker placement games of today. I actually enjoy the simplicity of this game.
2. Provost and the Sheriff. This game has a great mechanic where you can only select spots that the provost has moved past. Additionally, if you pick spots close to the provost, but the sheriff moves behind you, then you lose the use of that spot. Players can influence which direction the sheriff moves as well as how many spaces the provost moves. This causes a very interesting semi co-op dynamic where players close to the provost work together to move the sheriff up. Players far away work together to move the sheriff back.

Cons:
1. Simplistic: Above I said this could be a pro. It really just depends on your mood. Generally, I find this game a touch too simplistic.

Summary: This is a solid worker placement game with some interesting mechanics. I'd always be willing to play this game, but not so great that it is a must add to the collection. I would not begrudge anyone who has rated this game higher.

I think I can now see why this game is ranked as high as it is. There are several layers of depth to the strategies, and you will always have a choice of which way to go. One of the keys is to be able to change once something goes wrong.

In my second game I was able to jump out to a big lead, but started slowing down. I still won, but now I just need to get better at the end game.

After several plays, each game very different from the others: this game will take a LOT of play to figure out how to win (unless I take the easy and less-fun way, and copy other people's strategies).  It was definitely interesting trying to figure out what worked, and definitely fun. Very deep strategy, great player interaction, the more I play it, the better I like it. Update: I finally WON a game!

The rules for this game could have been written more clearly.  I don't yet have enough familiarity to recognize successful strategies.  A good game to read the rules for a couple of days beforehand before attempting.

This is the best game I have been introduced to since Innovation. So incredibly great! The level of intensity, depth, and planning is amazing. This is the first game that I have played with of planning and player interaction a kin to Power Grid. Many may find that comparison odd but I get something similar from both games. 

I highly recommend this to players that enjoy a significant planning component and level of depth.

I didn't play this for a while 2+ years but brought it back out recently and want to play it much much more. It is by far the best pure Action Drafting game.  The design is just so good it is difficult to imagine it being topped without adding more mechanics or making other changes that make the game feel very different. 
This certainly beats all the stupid harvesting, farming, feed your people non-sense action drafting games.

After the shelacking Caylus received from the Ameritrash crew ("Gaylus") I approached my first game of Caylus with as much excitement as my high school accounting exam.

Part of my Summer '07 order.  Not played yet, but hopeful.

Update:  Played half a game!... someday we'll get to this.
Update:  Played a full two player game!  Finally!  I enjoyed it.  I'll rate this after a few more plays... if I ever get the chance.
Update:  Played a few more games, with various numbers of players.

It's a LONG game.  It takes a few games to really get the feel of all the interlocking pieces and feel it all mesh together into something greater than the sum of its parts.  Figuring out an overall strategy for this game takes a good number of plays I feel.  I haven't played enough to get a firm understanding of how all the actions will affect everything else, but I'm starting to.

The problem is this.  The game is deep and complex enough to require this much playing to truly get a grasp... but each play is incredibly long.  This is a lot of time investment for a lot of people to get a good gaming group for it.

Great game, but lots of overhead.  Hard to bring out.

Update!!!
So I've finally gotten this game down to be playable in 1.5 hours.  Games can still go to 2-2.5 hours sometimes, but if people know what they are doing and don't sit and paralyze themselves it can move quickly.  I'm raising my rating.

Another Update!
I've been playing this more lately as some of my friends have become more invested in it as well.  I play mostly 2-players now, and I love it entirely.  I study it like chess.

It might just be that I've played a bunch of worker placement games before I got around to playing Caylus, but Caylus just doesn't thrill me.

Great game if you like heavy eurogames with so called " theme pasted on" it. There is unique push your luck mechanism. Some people believe in so called "winning strategy", it is just not true unless only one person know about it. And if so, well, if only one player plays game well, he is very likely to win in most of them.

Game may drag a little bit and it may be hard to predict how long it will take with new people, since it may vary from x to 2x turns. I don't see any other cons of this classic.

There's a lot of things to do in this game.  The breadth of options and game depth are appealing.  I'm a little concerned that there are some unbalanced objectives and dominant strategies, but I'll need far more playing experience to verify or refute that.  The game is slightly longer than it needs to be, and this mildly detracts from its long term appeal.

I played this game several times before I "got it" and I'm still not actually sure that I have "got it" to tell the truth.  I got my ass handed to me over and over again by one gaming group, only to come home and introduce this to friends of mine, and hand their ass to them over and over again.  Now that I'm comfortable with it, I really enjoy the mechanics of the game, and like the dynamic that is created, but I still feel like I'm somewhat lacking in the "juggling all that stuff together while paying attention to what everyone else is doing" department.

I think this could be a great game if I could get a group of 3 or 4 people together that have similar levels of skill in the game so that there is no clear person that is just pulling all the strings while everyone else is oblivious.

RATING: 7
Can't believe I waited so long to add this classic to my collection. Holds up very well in comparison to more recent worker placement games. Very tight, sometimes brutal. You'll always be asking yourself how far down the line you can afford to place your worker, and will your opponents spend their money just to stop you from taking the more advanced actions? It's a bit longer than comparable games, but the time doesn't drag. Probably one of the most interactive worker placement games available.

Update: I still enjoy the game, but it isn't quite as exciting as a lot of modern worker placement games.

I was dubious when Caylus appeared and instantly zoomed to an incredibly high ranking. I expected it to drop over time: it might be good, but could it be THAT good? But now I can say that Caylus is a wonderful game, reminiscent in style and quality to the enduring stars of eurogaming like Puerto Rico, El Grande, Princes of Florence, and Goa. Its strategy is deep and rich, it plays well with any number of players from 2 to 5, and it provides a game that is fascinating for its entire length start to finish. If you like eurogames, Caylus is not to be missed.

Intrincate game, with many point-harvesting options which feel less "scripted" than in, let's say, Puerto Rico. The theme is certainly interesting and well-captured, and production quality (especially for an up-and-coming company) very good. However, the plurality of tactical avenues and possible actions may make the game daunting at first play. It's hard to evaluate whether you're making steady progress or just scraping points here and there. More plays might refine my rating. Not one for beginners at Euro boardgaming.

The only issues I have with this are: 1. The length. It feels like a commitment. Once we get going, it's awesome. But it's hard to get ramped up. 2. It can sometimes feel like I'm playing against myself. This is partially my fault; I don't pay enough attention to how everyone else is doing. It's why I'm bad at poker; I play the cards, not my opponent. But it was noticeable in this one.

RATING: 5
Doesn't float my boat.  It's all there and all works, but is fairly unfriendly until you are several games in.  The main problem is that you can build any of tile the palette of buildings, but need to plan a turn in advance to get the right currency.  This necessitates a lot of shuffling of the tiles to see what is feasible and desirable.  In the long-run it is one of those games of squeezing points out at the margins of efficiency.  The secret of these games is that the engine has to be sufficiently obscure to make the perfect strategy non-calculable.  I think it probably does what it sets out to do reasonably well, however I prefer a game that is more 'readable' and that has greater shifts of fortune to give a sense of drama.

Caylus is a strong example of the genre where success relies on placing workers in the best order and acquiring the right combinations of coloured cubes etc.

It sounds dry but there are many nuances that make it more interesting. You have many ways to throw opponents off-track, there are diverse strategies and there are fun in-game decisions that modify the game's mechanisms.

There's plenty to like here if you enjoy this sort of devilish, ongoing light-math micro-management.

The overall feeling is of going about your 'worker placement' duties ... but also being like a hawk who will strike quickly to deprive an opponent of exactly what they need to do! They must never assume you will be benevolent and let them get the cubes/money they need.

What makes Caylus refreshingly different to most modern Euro games is how uncluttered it is. You look around the table and observe who needs what cubes etc, then pursue a course. There's no excessive detail or unknown variables to muddle the process. It relies on raw brain power, a bit like chess.

I was worried that improving at Caylus would require excessive mental effort but, after a few more games of it, it has become easier to focus on clever tactics and is becoming more rewarding. The game's relatively few components and good visibility also help you seize control and play-out your tactics with gusto.

Some other games, like the brilliant euro Hansa Teutonica, do seem better at allowing your intuition to help you along. But Caylus can become intuitive with practice.

Each turn goes around the table several times, with players selecting action spaces and typically blocking those spaces at the same time. You rely on whatever spaces haven't already been blocked during the turn. So you often just grab whatever best targets are still available, rather than working to a planned 'engine'. But I think that's fine because that 'routine stuff' is just a haze that might make you miss the glorious chances to mess with opponents.

However it IS a problem in that it makes Caylus much more tactical/reactive than strategic, despite it having many strategies to explore (I'm not sure this is a problem, though? - constant re-evaluation can be fun). You might not actually 'have a plan' until the last few turns (when you'll probably be trying to get a major Victory Points building without being blocked). It also means that AP (analysis paralysis) can be a constant issue, as players try to re-think (and re-math) their priorities mid-turn.

Caylus doesn't feel clunky, despite its age. It has very quick setup and teardown. You get a lot of possibilities in a fairly small playing space. Turns come around very quickly.

I also like how it's one of those games with no face-down components, which means it doesn't matter if pieces get scuffed or damaged.

It is better than the similar Orleans and Lords of Waterdeep. Orleans has arduous housekeeping to plan your actions. Waterdeep makes it really difficult to see what other players might be going for, simply because you can hardly see their face-up objective cards.

Caylus probably equals similar-ish brilliant euros like Vinhos, Bruxelles 1893, Kanban, Terra Mystica etc. I don't think it has as much spark or excitement as my current overall favourite Hansa Teutonica.

As Caylus is often called to be the first (at least very well known) worker placement game, I wondered how this will hold up with all the refined or stream lined takes on that genre as Agricola, Lords of Waterdeep, Russian Railroads, Tzolkin, Egizia or Dungeon Lords (most of which I quite enjoy). 

Oh boy, Caylus is such a good game! This is not just plain vanilla worker placement as in Lords of Waterdeep. Yes, you have the "building action spots" aspects, but you have replacing buildings, paying your workers for putting them to buildings, increasing the price for inserting workers by passing, asynchronity of placing workers and taking action and much more. I am amazed that such a complex but also clever version of worker placement is (cosidered) the origin of this mechanism (Dominion for example is a very "pure" deck building game). I also like that you cannot gain additional workers, which is very often turning worker placement games in races to get additional workers first.

A really clever design choice is the provost. Even if you have paid the worker, he may not take his action if players choose to pay for moving the provost. The mechanism is that only actions (action spaces are all in one line) up to the provost are executed. This is such a clever way of introducing interaction, but also makes Caylus a rather mean game. Furthermore, this action affects the number of rounds in the game and open ways for more elaborate strategies.

Of course the theme is very dry (building buildings and helping the king build his castle) and the art work is not very elaborate. But to me the art has still some appeal and give Caylus a very unique charm. The component quality is rather bad with many houses and even some worker cylinders (which I would like to have a different shape) malformed. The color of 1 and 5 franc coins could have also be more different and some icons on the board or resources needed for the buildings are not easily visible.

Further plays will show, if Caylus is among my top medium-heavy Euros.

Update: 8.5 to 9.0; after 7 games I still like Caylus a lot. Matches can play out really differently. It may not really seem so at first, but in Caylus the players really create the economy by choosing which buildings are built. I like this aspect in games a lot, when players do not follow a path, but create one.

I enjoyed my first game of Caylus a lot, despite finishing last by a huge margin. Players take turns to place workers on an expanding range of options to gather resources or money or to build future resources. It will be very familiar to players of Le Havre/Agricola which are clear fresh implementations of the same idea (even Key Market to a degree). 
However, there is one big difference between this and its imitators, in this there is no attempt to mitigate against the player competition, in fact its actively encouraged. The game is as much about judging when to screw over another player as it is about enhancing your own position. In some ways that makes it more appealing, though in others its a very harsh first play as a result.

RATING: 7.7
Caylus is a very sound game design 
which will provide hours of enjoyment.

The only minor imperfections which 
exist in the game are that :

1 the holding box allowing one to place 
your man on any unoccupied square 
that turn tends to be not frequently used

2 There seems to be too much repetition 
in strategy in the game, where for example : 
racing to build the Church building with
enough to build with its favour occurs Over and over again each game.  
Thus more Variety might have been built into the game so that many alternative Strategies to follow might have occurred instead of the same 
ones over and over again every game.

All in all however this is a very solid design.

RATING: 8
Despite having been a gamer for 3 years, and one who mainly gravitates towards the "Euro" end of the spectrum - and preferring "heavier" Euros at that - somehow I only managed to play this classic for the first (and so far only) time in the summer of 2014. I had previously played Caylus Magna Carta (the card game version - we actually own it), and not been that impressed with it - and yet, despite me not being able to identify more than a handful of differences between the two, I somehow found the original boardgame version much much more satisfying. Probably this means that I should revisit the card game, although there are definitely a few differences which I do think for my taste make the original definitely better - the King's Favours (which I don't recall from the card version at all), the fact that each building can only be built once (rather than each player potentially providing their own copy), and the fact that building requires placing a worker on particular spaces rather than always being available as an action. But what most impressed me during my one play was the core of the game - trying to place workers in such a way as to try to gain the resources you need to, say, build a building, or one or more sections of the castle, knowing that the actions will always be resolved in a certain order which has nothing to do with the order in which workers are placed. VPs are scored throughout, scores stay close throughout most of the game on the evidence of my one play, and I imagine that with a bit of experience it becomes very tense at the end as players try to get their hands on the big VP buildings first. I'd be delighted to play this one again at any time. (As of January 2016 I've still not managed to play this since that first game, but I'd be delighted to do so again.)

(9/25/07) - Just got this game. The complexity is intimidating but I can't wait to play with someone!

(2/1/08) - [9] - Having played a handful of times, I can safely say this is a great game. Even though I have yet to win a game, it's a hell of a lot of fun to play. Multiple paths to victory, so many choices but so few resources. I wasn't sure whether or not I would like a hardcore Euro like this one, but I am pleasantly surprised!

(7/30/08) - [7.5] - After having now played Pillars of the Earth, I can no longer in good conscience give Caylus a 9.

(5/1/13) - Caylus has been sold as part of a larger liquidation of my collection. It hadn't seen play in a while, and if I have a huge desire to play I can always go with an electronic version.

I enjoyed my play of this game. I enjoyed resource gathering to build the buildings. In my 2-player game we didn't build enough to keep up with the bailiff and thus the provost didn't threaten as much blocking as I expected. It might be more the case in 3 or 4 player games. I also wish there was more of a benefit for being the person to build (like a few stone buildings do). It's still good.

prone to analysis paralysis, and falls apart if you don't give into the AP (e.g. misplays give big advantages or penalties to other players in a way that is hard to predict if players are not all being very careful with every play).  There is something good going on, but I don't think it quite works for me.

Update:  with experienced & fast players (or a computer), the game is less AP prone, and I instead find that it is not nearly as deep as it first appeared.  There is a  lot of routine moves with occasional strategic plays.

I vastly prefer Caylus Magna Carta -- much less AP, much shorter play time, fewer resources, and I find that it is just as deep and a bit more heuristic.

Another game I'd like to rate higher, and probably deserves it, however my only complaint actually stems from the players themselves. Analysis time can become extended, and while that actually shows everyone is making decisions that matter, it can drag the game out slightly. Not a flaw in the game, but it does detract for me a bit

Finally played (2008-10-13) after wanting to for a long time.  No luck, no hidden information, but unlike a typical more elegant abstract [[combinatorial game]] Caylus has lots of chaotic interacting subsystems, so it's like Shadow of the Emperor in that regard.

Very cool game!  The only drawbacks seem to be:
1. Hard to grok all the rules at first.  But after both reading the rules and talking about them, we dove in and just learned as we went.
2. Takes longer than we'd like. (Our first game, with 2 players, took 2 hours.)

Played on BSW - only 2-player but, after a half dozen games, it's already getting very same-y.  I suspect I'd like it better with the added chaos of more players.

Played again - 4-player is *much* more interesting than 2-player.

For now, I'd say 4-player gets an 8; 2-player gets a 6; average is 7.  If 3- and 4-player continues to be better, I'll raise my rating to reflect that and just assume that 2-player is suboptimal.

Now that we are familiar with the buildings and the rules, we have found this game to be quite enjoyable.

Other than that, it has lots of paths to victory and each game so far has been very different from the last.

Having played multiple other worker placement games, this game just doesn't do it for me. I think the game is just way too long for what it is. 

The game is deep in strategy and has a lot of choices, but if the game was shortened in half, it would be just fine. 

Edit: After a second play I enjoyed the game much more. I actually may grow to like this game. There are some elements of the game that I just didn't enjoy and thought could be removed, but all in all the game is very deserving of all of its praise.

RATING: 9
Still one of my favorite WP games. Many descendants, but no game has really replaced some of the key features that made it great - paying to place your workers and it getting more expensive as players drop out (none of this paying to recruit/give birth to more workers that seems to be the preferred WP modus operandi), bonuses (points and cubes) to the building owner when another player uses it, access to all buildings to choose from removing luck of the draw, uncertainty about whether an action will activate and the tug-of-war dynamics around that, turn order independent of seating order...  To a new player, the castle building can seem like an add-on when in fact it is the main part of the game everything else is built around.  Unlike most WP, it is quite good 2-player but plays well as all player counts (avoid 5 with AP-prone players).  Another one of the elegant Euros that has fallen by the wayside since it doesn't need expansions or updates to improve it and keep it in the spotlight, but I think this would do well with a retheme and some minor updates to make it seem fresh. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game that is credited for starting worker placement. This is a unique game where workers are placed on the board to take actions that allow you to gather resources, build buildings or work on the Caylus castle. However, the provost can shut down your action space after you have already paid your worker to work.  The provost can be bribed by different players to shut down certain action buildings making this game pretty ruthless.You are always having to adjust and readjust your plans. This game is for heavy strategy gamers and requires a lot of thinking.The game runs long for this reason at over 2 1/2 hours and maybe closer to 3 1/2 hours. I enjoy this one a lot but concede that this game may not be for everyone especially casual gamers.

Pros: Heavy strategy, deep thinking decisions, 

Cons: light on theme, long games with indecisive players,  gameplay can be cutthroat.

After more plays and more time thinking about the game... I have to move this to a 10. I haven't spent as much time thinking about my next play of a game in a very long time. This game crushes PR in terms of decisions, and more importantly, fun. Its just a ton of fun to play. The game plays quickly once you get your head around it, and the time just flies by. I can't recommend this one enough. I was skeptical of the hype, but I guess there are times when its derserved. Amazing.

Dropped slightly due to length with the wrong players. Still fantastic.

--Oct2005-- (after one play)  Interesting game.  A bit slower than I'd expected, though could speed up with some experience.  Very interesting dynamics, and quite a lot of fun.  I'm on the fence a bit as to the rating: looks like a high 8 to me right now, but  has the potential to become a 9 if I could reliably finish a game in less than two hours.
--Jan2006-- After a few more games:  it's great - but too slow.
--May2006-- My opinion is mostly unchanged:  I'm simultaneously equally certain that the game takes too long, and that it really does provide an excellent gaming experience.  But I'm less convinced today that it's much over that "too long" threshold; the game holds one's attention very well - it's just difficult to find a time slot sufficiently long to play it.

RATING: 8
Even though this is a longer game (which doesn't bother me since our group is quite quick) I really enjoy the complexity of choices and options in this one.  I find money management to be difficult and have played a game where all the resource huts transmuted into residences very early as several players were going for the blue buildings at the end.
While there are minor flaws...  I feel like there is a compelling game here and one that I would like to get better at.

I kept this one for as long as I did mainly for nostalgia and "gamer geek cred." While it is an excellent game, Lords of Waterdeep implemented the "player-owned action space" mechanic, and the "take that" of the Provost ends up causing more problems than it solves, so LoW had essentially fired this game for me.

Wonderfully dense and puzzley. The provost is nowhere near as mean as some would have you believe. It's a perfect information game, so the possible effects of the provost is always clear and is just another cost analysis like every other decision in the game.

I will need to play more to be sure, but it seems like there are many different avenues to victory, which should keep the game fresh.

RATING: 10
Áááááá, itt az újabb őőőőrület! :D

Az elején még kicsit dadogott a játékmenet, de aztán gyorsan hozzászoktatott a játék ahhoz, hogy hihetetlen gondos, patika mérlegen kimért, precíz tervezés szükséges az építkezésekhez (a sorrend mindenek felett!).

100% euro, nagyon mély stratégiát igénylő, ugyanakkor mindig az aktuális helyzethez igazított taktikát megkövetelő játék. Az igazi finomságát a királyi kegyek alkalmazásában, a passzolás "intézményében" látom.

Szigorúan csak gémereknek, mert másnak elsőre talán elrettentő lehet.


A játékidőt többen negatívumnak róják fel. Magam úgy gondolom, hogy észre sem lehet venni azt a kb. 2 órát, amit egy Caylus parti jelent. Gyakorlatilag "kiesik az idő". Ráadásul a szabályokat átnézve azt gondolja az ember, hogy sok a holtidő. Ez azonban messze nem igaz, hisz folyamatosan koncentrálni kell, és szinte mindig újra kell gondolni a helyzetet, annak függvényében, hogy a többi játékos milyen lehetőségeket hagy meg.

Rules feel more complex than they are. Very streamlined gameplay. Some downtime with AP. Lots of difficult decisions all the way, more so in the end. Lots and lots of different routes to take. High replay value, more so than with PR (the obvious comparison).

Finally up to a 10. In the same class as Puerto Rico and Goa, a true gem of a gamers game. More intuitive, more interactive (well, nastier), and great fun.

People said, if you want one game with no luck involved, try Caylus. This kind of game usually freaks people out, including me, I admit. Some little bit of luck is important even for a strategic game, i.e. you can't allow someone with a higher IQ beat you everytime! Otherwise, I'd rather play Chinese Chess. However, Caylus is more interesting than Chess, themewise.

I played twice my first time out and have to admit I enjoyed it a bit more than Puerto Rico, which I think is it's prime competitor.  I felt a bit more in control, although it was certainly a resource-tight game play that keeps you on your toes.  In particular I thought I had better opportunities to affect other people's positions, as a group rather than as individuals.  This was a nice aspect.  I look forward to my next game.

Late Update -- I have downgraded my rating on this game a bit.  Intense and interesting, but it doesn't seem to call to me from the shelf.  If I have enough time to play Caylus, I'll likely go after El Grande or Struggle of Empires instead.  These games are in the same family, but significantly better choices for me.

It goes against my usual likes and dislikes, but I find myself actually quite taken with Caylus. It's fascinating in the way that games like Chess and Backgammon are, in that you see lots of depth beyond what you expected. It's about that abstract too, but it doesn't bother me here. It's a VERY Euro Eurogame, but it's also a good one.

RATING: 9
This game is the real deal: having played and observed a lot of games online and off, I feel it's safe to say that Caylus has an amazing variety of routes to victory, featuring some positional strategy and a lot of tactical evaluation and planning. Only drawback so far is the length, which may or may not keep it from reaching 10 status.

Also, I've made a player aid for it (actually, a building aid) which you can find under "Files" in the BGG entry.

Yet another cube pusher. Nice to play something multiplayer and deterministic for a change. But, the playing time seems wrong: it's either a bit long or a bit short.

RATING: 7.5
In Caylus players are helping to build a castle whilst building up the town around it. Each player is granted up to 6 actions per turn, as long as they can afford it. Actions are determined by the buildings placed on the board (some of the buildings grant the action of building a building) with a few buildings printed on the board.  Each worker placed on a building will cost at least one gold, plus additional gold for each player who has already passed.  If a player's building is used by another player the owner is granted a point and gold, and since most buildings are unique players are carefully considering what to build and what to use. Each building built grants points, as does building onto the castle. At the end of the game the player with the most points wins.

The king of euros, the first and best worker placement game. I love brain burning it provides, varying player order, careful planning, predicting opponents' actions and even counting every cube every player has and will have at the end of the turn.

RATING: 8
I can understand why people may love this game, but I have probably found it the least enjoyable of the worker-placement games I have played so far. Extremely ugly and garish board and component design, laborious play. Has merits which I may grow to appreciate if badgered into playing again, eg admittedly a continued sense of involvement. First play wasn't helped by the fact that the explainer went into great depth about the mechanics, without giving any of the 'theme' explanations of what the hell we were actually doing and whatever all the little cubes were supposed to represent. It really underlined the whole 'book-keeping' nature of the game. Plus he was hyper-competitive, talking players out of making any decision that adversely affected himself, ho-hum. On the whole I was disappointed by the game as I find the box art appealing and intruiging. 
Edit (Oct 2010): I finally got to play Caylus in more amenable circumstances, and enjoyed it very much. Plus I won, which helps a lot in the game appreciation stakes. Deep and involving, but possibly too long if facing competition from other games that scratch a similar itch.

My absolute favorite. Caylus is so great I actually had to demote some of my other ratings, as it redefined what 10 means to me. Zero luck, perfect information, cutthroat player interaction, multiple paths to victory, incredibly well balanced - just 100% gaming awesomeness throughout. Certainly not the game for everyone and it arguably only plays well when all players are at comparable skill levels but I can't let these factors lower my opinion. Sadly, though, they've made it impossible for me to find a group of players for this outside of BSW.

RATING: 7
It's engrossing, but has a lot of little nagging negatives that added up mean I just don't feel like pulling it out over many of the other great offerings on my shelf. The building cost cubes on the tiles could have been increased in size - from the other side of the table you just can't see the costs, especially when the lighting is producing a bit of glare. I decline to comment about the money chips other than to say that we use the money from Roma to stop ourselves from being driven loopy. Other than that the game seems okay, but for pushing little wooden pieces around in the last year I've certainly have more fun with other released games for the year such as Antike, Louis XIV and Das Ende des Triumvirates.
Began to like it more after studying the tiles and becoming more familiar with which tile costs what and does what. The game is quite draining, with a lot of plans and ideas to remember for the next round. Exhausting actually. Enjoy it more with three than with five.

The worker placement, the main mechanic of [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602]Caylus[/i][/url], is the precursor of a new line of really great games, such as [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/22545]Age of Empires III:  The Age of Discovery[/i][/url], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21920]Leonardo Da Vinci[/i][/url], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34635]Stone Age[/i][/url], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27364]Caylus Magna Carta[/i][/url] (of course), [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24480]Pillars of the Earth[/i][/url] and [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/30957]Tribune: Primus Inter Pares[/i][/url], among others.  Only for this contribution it deserves a special place in the gaming world, even when some of its sons are way better than the father.  Speaking of other things, I must say that I like it better than [i]Caylus Magna Carta[/i], cause it isn't true that the king's favors are difficult to handle; in fact, they are an important part of the game.

A would-be Spiel Des Jahres if not for the slightly heavy rules.  The game takes a while to explain (~10 minutes), but once a single round is played, it's simple intuition to understand.  There is almost no randomness except in the initial tile placement, which is hardly critical, especially late in the game and a well-planned strategy early on in the game is necessary to win.  This game is all about strategy, but winning does rely on some aggressive play using the provost.  Fun, thought provoking, and a gorgeous board that is designed as a built-in instruction manual.

Have only played a few games on iOS, but this may challenge Agricola at the top of my list.

That creepy Caylus king has been eyeing me for a while, daring me to give it a try. So I finally opened it up this year and gave it a try with my wife. And it is really great.

Because I have played so many games that are derivative of Caylus to varying levels (Waterdeep, Tzolk'in, etc.), the rules were somewhat simple and straight forward for us to understand. In fact, I think that's why I didn't really want to play it for a while: oh, it's another worker placement game with buildings and resources and scoring points? Sounds too familiar.

But it's great! The provost is such a unique and interesting mechanic to add some tension and interaction. All the buildings are out and available to see from the beginning to plan out strategies. Because of the buildings and favor tracks and castle, there are multiple ways to pivot and posture and score points. And in the end, it's another example of a dry, rules-heavy, thinly-themed Euro winning me over once again. (Plus, it played really well with 2, which makes it easy for my wife and I to enjoy.)

I'm gonna go with a tentative 5 here. Waaaaaay overhyped. Caylus feels bloated with so many things that don't seem equal. There are some buildings that get built solely for the VPs, and will likely never get used for the rest of the game---while others are used every single round. And some of the Favors seem competely useless--the Cubes, for instance. It's needlessly complicated, which gives the illusion of deep fun, but when compared to the elegance and thought put into Princes of Florence, it pales. It reminds me of a writer in need of a good editor: If you pare away everything that's unnecessary you would likely have a very good game.

And it all works together very well.  This is a masterpiece of a game.

RATING: 9
It seems like there are more and more mediocre games being produced each year (or maybe I'm just becoming more selective about the games I like).  So, when a game like Caylus (which I believe to be legitimately on the level of all time classics like El Grande, Puerto Rico or Princes of Florence) is released, there is inevitably a hype and a backlash before it settles down to its place in a game collection.  On some level, the game is similar to Puerto Rico in that the main strategies at first blush are to use resources to either build buildings or to "ship" them to the castle for victory points.  Either strategy (or a mixed one) can win, depending on your opponents' actions.  Since the game play is so dynamic, you need to constantly reevaluate your position to try to use your resources in the most efficient manner.  But it's the royal favors element that really puts Caylus over the top.  These bonuses are available at the castle as well as on the building side of the game, and you can use them to either fill any gaps in your strategy or to push you over the edge to victory.  The knock on Caylus is its length, and there's no doubt that it is a touch long.  Maybe repeated playings will drive the play time down a bit, but, even as it stands, when immersed in the game, time flies by for me, and I consider the time it takes to play Caylus very well spent.

RATING: 6
Until you know how to definitively beat this game due to a flaw in the game (see below for more details), Caylus can be a fun game that can keep you on your toes the entire time, and can get infinitely more fun & intense as you add more players. Your strategies must constantly shift moment-by-moment throughout this game based upon what your opponents are doing at any given second, and if you can somehow master the fine art of gaining a holistic understanding of what every player is trying to accomplish, you MAY be able to win the game -- yet there are so many offensive & defensive strategies that your opponents can use against you, there is no guarantee that your plan will be achieved! There is virtually ZERO downtime in this game -- something is happening at every given moment. Plus, there is only a VERY SMALL amount of luck in this game (if any at all) -- the vast majority it is pure strategy. There are a few big downsides to this game, however: one is that the rulebook is very poorly written, and extraordinarily difficult for new players to understand. But with the help of the additional files posted to BGG by other members, you can figure out the game. Another major downside (and the biggest problem with this game) is that my group of friends has discovered a major flaw in the game: if you only do one simple activity during the game -- building in the castle & nothing else -- you are almost guaranteed a victory 100% of the time.  This saps all of the fun & excitement out of Caylus. Up until we discovered that flaw, Caylus was a fun, challenging, and intense game.

Another good example of a game that loses point for each player beyond 2 (where it's an 8.)  With three it's probably 7 and with four it's only a 6.  And never, ever play this with 5.  It certainly works, and if you are all new to the game, there is no problem.  But after that...

I have to play it one more time to give it a 10 ... I liked (read - loved) it from the start. Did buy a copy at Eindhoven Spellenspektakel (dutch rules contains a lot of mistakes, so please correct them White Goblin !!!). This is the one I really wanted to have in my collection.

This really is a tough one to rank. The subtleties are deep and after four games I still don't quite have the grasp of the stretegy. I have met William (the designer) across the Diplomacy board a few times and he is such a likeable guy  I have to give him a good rating. Seriously though, very well designed.

RATING: 5
The verdict is in, and survey says... enh.  Pretty decent game, a little more work and time than I would like.  No major flaws that I can think of.  Lots of indirect interaction.  Good shift from tactics to strategy.  Very process-oriented.  Definitely a sizable "wha?"-factor your first time out.  I will play again, but don't have a burning desire to own it.

RATING: 4
Dry and boring. 

There are several places I want to go, but I only get to go to at most one of those spots per turn. This makes it feel impossible to accomplish anything efficiently. People block you constantly, and there are not enough spaces worth going to. 

I don't like the hockey puck mechanic, and I don't like the implementation of the favors.

Am a big fan.  Each game play so different.  So many paths to victory.  Strategy and tactics both.

Love the way it works.  Everything is great.  Except those annoying money tokens that is.  But Rio Grande sent me the 2nd Ed coins so now they're great too!

Can be brutal, unforgiving and brain burning.  I always feel like I've run a mental marathon at the end, but am totally satisfied.

RATING: 9.5
Played twice at BGG.CON '05... Not up to the hype. Takes too long, not very 'fun' really. It's still a good game, and fun in the way that Puerto Rico or Princes of Florence are fun. That is to say it's a lot of work... but not the kind of work you hate to do.

Update 2/18/06: I have played quite a bit. For 2 or 3 players it is a terribly good game. For 4 or 5 players it's simply terrible. I highly recommend Caylus 2 or 3 player, not so much for 4 or 5 players unless you're going for a more social, less competetive atmosphere. For me, if I want that atmosphere, I don't play a strategy game.

Update 6/12/06: I have played even more, and I've come around to like 4 and 5p Caylus more and more. 3p is still the better, more strategic, competetive game, but 4 and 5 player is still very good. It's sort of harder that way, and there are things I don't like about it as much, like starting and being low on the turn order sucks, but it's better than I gave it credit for before.

This would be a 10 if I plyed it more often (like PR)

RATING: 10
If you were only going to have one Eurogame in your collection - or one Worker Placement game, then this would have to be a major contender. Whilst not the first WP game, it is the game that defines the genre. Easy to teach and play, very difficult to master, with the tactical choices coming thick and fast. The theme, pasted on as in all Eurogames, works beautifully and feels right.

A brilliant game - a design masterpiece.

Great game overall! The end drags on one or two more turns than you sometimes need to determine the winner, but I love how the building choices can influence the way the game plays drastically. The one down side to Caylus is always finish it feeling exhausted. Recently downgraded... too annoying with 4 or 5 players and too little real strategy options.

A tremendous tactical game with a variety of ways to win, all equally good. Whatever strategy you start with will inevitably have to adapt to the flow of the game and the opportunities that present themselves. A truly great player at this game can advance their cause while striking at their opponents weaknesses. I'm not there yet, but I long for more plays.

Like Arkham Horror there is pain, except this is more like the pain you get from having to go to the bathroom while at work and you can't leave your desk.  I don't like this game for many reasons.  First, it's D-R-Y.  Like an over-baked saltine that's been sitting in the Sahara desert under a scorching sun type of dryness.  Second, no catchup mechanic...at all.  Make a mistake early on against a semi-skilled opponent and for the next two hours, you get to watch as your opponent's lead gets bigger and bigger.  Yup, I know what you're thinking - great fun.  I don't feel like I'm building a town, or a castle and I sure don't feel like a sort of idealized version of a complete Renaissance man.  Unless subjected to pain of death, I won't be playing this anytime soon.

My husband liked it, I didn't. We bought this soon after our entry into the world of board gaming some ten years ago, moving from Carcassonne to Agricola to this. I'm not a huge fan of Agricola either though it still has a place on the shelf, so maybe I just don't like worker placement games? But I do really enjoy Village so I suspect it isn't as simple as that. I've not played Caylus in a while having made a bad association with it, but now that several years have passed I suppose I should give it another go as I am struggling to remember the specific things I didn't like about it. Motivation to do so is very weak however - Caylus made an appearance at a game group a few weeks ago and I certainly didn't regret choosing to play Castles of Burgundy instead.

Caylus (1st English edition) -- Played four-player.  Never felt like I was building anything, though building the castle is the ostensible goal of each player.  Also, I had hoped to feel like we were developing the village outside the castle.  While my personal desire for a sense of construction may not have been satisfied, there was a sense of progression.  Our first was a very long game, yet I felt engaged throughout.  I look foward to more plays to determine why it is that I like it.

RATING: 1.5
One solo game. 

I was surprised that this supposedly terrifying euro wasn't terrifying at all. More along the lines of mediocre and pedestrian. And I didn't realise "Yo, dawg" games were so old (stuff upon stuff upon stuff). If you look at Caylus from the right angle you can see cogwheels protruding from it. 

So let's see - boring as hell, and it's not the theme or lack of one, it's that resource to victory point conversion spread sheet. I almost cried out of boredom when setting up the game, and had intervals of utter apathy while playing. Surely it plays much better than it looks - it's mildly entertaining to juggle these cubes around and go for this or that "clever" mechanism. But seriously, Rosenberg does cold calculating euros gig much better. And Puerto Rico which somewhat inspired this was much more tight and original design. The good thing that Caylus did is that people saw it went [i]"Hm, interesting, but what if I remove half of this stuff?"[/i] and so worker placements were born.

เกมส์สุดโปรด Top 5 ตลอดกาลของข้าพเจ้า

เป็นเกมส์ที่จะให้เราผลัดกันวางตัวตามช่อง Action ต่างๆ หลักจากนั้นก็เริ่มไล่ทำ Action จากหน้าประตูอาณาจักรตามลำดับ หลังจากได้ทรัพยากรก็สามารถนำไปสร้างบ้านหรืออาคารเพื่อขยายความเจริญไปสู่ท้องถิ่น หรือจะเน้นไปพัฒนาสร้างบ้านภายในปราสาทเอาใจพระราชาเพื่อแลกแต้มคะแนนและรางวัลพิเศษต่างๆกันไป

เป็นเกมส์คิดเยอะๆเกมส์แรกๆที่ผมได้เล่นหลังจากเข้าวงการบอร์ดได้ไม่นาน และผมก็ชอบตั้งแต่ครั้งแรกที่ได้เล่น เพราะสมัยก่อนก็เริ่มจากเล่นเกมส์ปาร์ตี้ฮาๆ หรือไม่ก็เกมส์เก็บคะแนนแบบทอยเต๋าเน้นดวงตามประสา พอได้สัมผัสเกมส์ตึงๆเผาหัวเยอะๆครั้งแรกเลยติดใจและกลายเป็นการแตกแขนงเกมส์เผาหัวอื่นๆตามมาอีกเป็นยวง

ข้อดีหลักๆคือเกมส์เล่นได้หลากหลายสาย จะไปเน้นสร้างตึกสร้างบ้านบวกแต้มรอเพื่อนมาเหยียบทำแอคชั่นตอดคะแนนเล็กๆน้อยๆ หรือสายเอาใจพระราชาคอยสร้างเสริมตึกภายในปราสาทเน้นล่ารางวัลพิเศษ หรือจะดองทรัพยากรแล้วตู้มสร้างตึกพิเศษคะแนนกระฉูดเดินคะแนนที่20-30แต้มก็สุดแล้วแต่จะปราถนา แต่ละสายก็ไม่ได้โกงสุดโต่ง ไม่มีสูตรตายตัวเฉพาะ อยากเล่นสายไหนหรือจะผสมสัดส่วนวิธีการทำคะแนนต่างๆกันไปก็ไม่มีปํญหาใดๆ ทำให้อยากเล่นหลายครั้งเพื่อลองวิธีทำคะแนนใหม่ๆ 

อย่างที่สองก็คือเกมส์แทบไม่มีดวงมาเกี่ยวเลย เรียกว่าเฉือดเฉือนวัดความเก๋าเกมส์ของพวกฮาดคอร์เกมเมอร์ได้เป็นอย่างดี (อ่อนแอก็แพ้ปายยยยยย)

เกมส์แอบมีInteractionเล็กน้อยแบบหอมปากหอมคอ มีใครมาเหยียบตัดหน้าช่องที่เราอยากได้ก็มีเรียกพ่อล้อแม้กันเล็กน้อย, หรือจะแกล้งเพื่อนด้วยการบังคับตัวขาว(Provost)เดินไปกันไม่ให้เพื่อนๆได้ทำActionที่ตัวเองวางไว้ เรียกว่าเล่นแล้วไม่เงียบเหงาเฉาตายคาโต้ะเท่าไหร่นัก

อีกอย่างก็คือเกมส์นี้เล่นแต่ละรอบจะได้ฟิวลิ่งวิธีการทำคะแนนคนละแบบค่อนข้างชัดเจน บางครั้งตานี้ทรัพยากรกระจาย เหยียบช่องไหนก็ได้แต่ของ สร้างตึกกันทะลุขอบกระดานทั้งๆที่เล่นไปแค่ครึ่งเกมส์, บางครั้งตึกไม่โผล่มาสักตึก ขาดแคลนช่องหาทรัพยากร เล่นไปจะจบเกมมีตึกอยู่แค่สี่ห้าหลังก็มี นี่ก็อยู่ที่มุมมองความเก๋าของผู้เล่นละว่าเล่นแบบไหนให้สามารถทำคะแนนเพื่ออยู่รอดในสถานการณ์ต่างๆได้

จุดที่ควรระวังคือ ผู้เล่นใหม่ๆจะงงกับระบบการสร้างสิ่งก่อสร้างภายในปราสาท,การจบแต่ละยุคและการโดนลบคะแนน รวมไปถึงระบบ  King Favour ที่มีเงื่อนไขต่างๆที่อาจจะทำให้ผู้เล่นสับสนได้ ตรงนี้ต้องสอนให้ดีและระวังหรือเตือนเพื่อนๆในวงกันสักหน่อย (ยิ่ง King Favour แถวสุดท้ายนี้ เล่นกับหลายวงแล้วชอบเข้าใจผิดกัน คนที่อ่านกฎเก่งๆอังกฤษชับๆก็อธิบายเพื่อนในวงให้ดีๆหล่ะครับ)

RATING: 6
Many games have the "get resources and then convert to victory points", but this one does it all out, with a dozen different paths, some of them requiring three or four steps each. One of the nice things about the game is how different buildings built earlier in the game can change the opportunities for later strategies, so every game plays very different.

But with ten different colored pieces, a meandering board that goes this way and that, a variable turn order, and a board where the functions get covered over by the pieces, too much of the game's thinking comes just from trying to figure out and remember the game state, which is not a good thing.

The game is 20-40% too long and way too fiddly. There's more struggling with the mechanics than playing against your opponents. And some of these mechanics are simply superfluous.

A dense and dry worker placement game which I've played sporadically over the years. It's horribly abstract even by Euro standards, and cluttered with random tasks that mostly involve sucking up to the king. I always end up exhausted after playing this because I'd have an expression of bewilderment frozen on my face for two straight hours. 

For me, Caylus has simply been outclassed by subsequent games which have taken inspiration from it and built something better from there. Probably the only reason why I'd come back to this title is because of that darn fickle provost. It's a remarkably layered mechanism which throws players into a game of chicken to see who will end up controlling the provost.

Like Agricola (which I prefer) it feels like a classic; both in the sense that it's a very good game, but also in the sense that it just doesn't get played a lot. It is quite heavy (for me, at least) and so for those reasons I only give it a 7. I'm sure many justifiably give it 9 or higher.

I have no idea why Caylus has been compared to Puerto Rico. Both have wooden cubes and are in the typical German game mold but that's where the similarities end.There are a wealth of options that  require a few games to fully explore but good players will easily beat poor players. One must concentrate in order to get the best from the game. 

Potential Kingmaking if you play with less than serious gamers. I think the hype is real because we all want to see a serious contender to Puerto Rico (in terms of a combination of interesting mechanics, tension and just good gaming magic).Sadly, Caylus is not it.

Overall, it's a little dry, the board looks unattractive, the art amateurish almost and rather linear.

Meets all my heavy euro needs. There are many possible roads to victory and during the game you feel that there is always one more thing you need to do, but can't. I have to say Caylus is on the complex side in the rules departement and somewhat of a brain burner.

Caylus is a very deep game.  It  took dozens of plays before I really appreciated it, especially the 2 player game.  I like this more every time I play it.  No two games seem to unfold in the same way, so the replay value is extremely high.

*****

I've started playing this on BSW recently, and I am appreciating it even more now.  I love games where you have to watch and consider what your opponents are doing as much what you're doing yourself.

I wasn't sure I really wanted to play this one.  I had heard so many good and bad things about it.

I thought that the two-hour time length made the game worthwhile, but I certainly wouldn't want to play this game with a group that could drag the game out into three hours or more.  I don't understand the game or any of the strategy yet.  I might be tempted to play the game again with a similar group, but I really need to read the rules or something before doing that.

Nagyon erős játék. Egy kétszemélyes játék alkalmával ismertem meg, de biztos vagyok benne, hogy 3-4-en működik igazán tökéletesen. Ketten is teljesen élvezhető, nem véletlenül a magas pontszám.
Fa, kő épületek, lakóházak, presztízsépületek, várépítés, különböző módon aktiválódó épületek. Összetett játékmenet, biztosan több játék kell a jó stratégia megalkotásához, emiatt és az épületek biztosan más időben és módon való felépítései miatt nagy újrajátszhatósági faktorú játékról van szó. Átlátható tábla, szép komponensek. A játék összetettsége miatt van esély az elhúzódó gondolkodási fázisra, de mivel egy-egy munkást felváltva teszünk le, így nem olyan nagy a holtidő. Egyedül az intézőt érzem a játék gyenge pontjának, pedig akár a legérdekesebb elem is lehetne. Mégpedig azért, mert óriási konfliktusforrást jelent. Az, hogy egy-egy épületet elfoglalnak egymás elől a játékosok, az teljesen belefér, viszont az intézővel egy-egy játékos munkását akár teljesen kizárhatjuk a játékból és ezzel akár adok-kapok is kialakulhat az már soknak tűnik. Párok esetében pedig erős sértődöttség is keletkezhet. Ha pedig megegyeznek a játékosok az intézővel való csatározások elkerülésében, akkor talán egy érdekes rész esik ki a játékból. Szóval ez nagyon partifüggő elem. A családi verzió is kitalálásra került, így akár könnyedebbé is lehet tenni a játékot. Mindenképp helye van a top játékok közt.

[2011-10-02]
A jubileumi kiadással volt szerencsém a második Caylus partimat megejteni. Felemásak az érzéseim. A lapkák, a fém pénzek csodaszépek, de a tábla szerintem nem sikerült jól. Nagyon sötét, nekem kevésbé átlátható, mint az eredeti kiadásé. A játék továbbra is nagyon jó. Nagyon mély. Annyiban javult a véleményem róla, hogy nagyon is jó elem a kisbíró a játékban. Nagyon drága végig kiszúrásra használni, nem éri meg hosszútávon egyértelműen. De a játék végének kiváltásban jó taktikai elem. A játékban levő sok lehetőség viszont engem frusztrál. Érdekes módon, jobban, mint például a Vulgariban, pedig abban sem kevés a lehetőség. Nem lesz a nagy kedvencem sosem a Caylus, de nagyon jó játék továbbra is. 

[2013-01-26]
Ezzel a kisbíróval valahogy nem tudok megbarátkozni. Sikerült kipróbálni öten, izgalmas így is a játék, de a bíró akár egyszeri mozgatása is helyezésekről dönthet. Olyanokkal játszva, akiknek nem többedik partijuk mindig kijön ennek királycsináló volta. Ez persze valószínű a legtöbb ember szerint nem hibája egy játéknak, nálam viszont egyértelműen nem tetsző elem. Így eggyel rontok a ponton.

What a neat game...but as with a lot of Euro games, I think they could do a much better job with the themes.  Aren't we a little tired of the same old "middle ages, castle, worker" games?  

As good as these games are, and as well thought out they are, can't they spend the same time trying to figure out a fresh, new theme?  That is what you have to give to Ameritrash games...they at least try.

As a fan of perfect information games this game really hits home.  The great thing though is that while there are an absurd amount of options initially, you are only allowed the ability to do one thing at a time, options get used up, and the turns get faster and faster. 

Still, it can be a long game, especially with A/Pers. Even suffering from downtime I find the system so rewarding that it merits and awards the patient.

This really takes some of the best things from Way out West's (and now Byzantium's) action selection and gives them growth and ownership.  When I first played this I gave it a 9.  After a couple plays I see the error of my ways.

For some crazy reason our last game took 5 hours, and we were so into it, we didn't realize that the game had taken so long.  A game so engrossing time disappears.

Wow.  I just played this one for the first time and it was quite an experience.  Though the rules are complex, and I came into the first game without any notions of strategy, I thought it went really well.  This is most definitely a gamer's game, but from the reaction of the others that I played with, this game came out very differently from their prior play.  I look forward to playing this again.

----

I still like Caylus after my second play, but like in so many other complex games, I always feel like I'm steps behind the other players.  Perhaps it's because I should probably go into this one with a real strategy, rather than 'winging' the whole game.---I feel better after a third play.  Still don't have a "real" strategy for this one, but were I to start emulating the players that do have a "real" strategy, I could do better.

I think there are a lot of nostalgia votes for Caylus -- no doubt it is a solid game, and certainly once a GREAT game, but it has long since been surpassed by mechanics and theme in other games that I enjoy more.  Keeping in mind, of course, that many of those games I enjoy more borrowed things from Caylus.

The rules are pretty simple and it's more strategic than most medium-heavy boardgames. I'm pretty sure no 2 games will ever be the same so it has great replay value. I prefer 2-3 players since I don't like the provost's chaotic movement with more players.

Tight game of money and resource management with opportunities for defense and bluffing.  Rewards strategic thinking as well as tactical opportunism.  Many decisions to be made every turn, with minimal downtime.  Challenging, accessible, multiple paths to victory.  Every game is different due to the variety and timing of resource availability.  Like Puerto Rico, there is a long rules explanation at the beginning that seems overwhelming, but it begins to click early in the game, and seems simple and intuitive by the end.

I always feel like I'm one opponent's worker placement from total disaster in this game.  I like that.

So many neat subtleties to this one, and different strategies to try.  Rush the castle, screw the castle and just build buildings, play the favour track, command the provost.  The bit where you can keep placing workers after somebody passes, but it costs more, is just so deliciously evil.  

I don't have to think too hard playing Puerto Rico or Power Grid anymore.  I have to think during Caylus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the most intense worker placement games I've played. The provost adds a nice mean streak to the game, as a costly option to deny players to perform their chosen actions. These actions have to be bought and money is very tight in this game, making it extra frustrating when your actions are cancelled. When players pass the cost of these actions increases and this is another way to screw with the plans of other players. But, players already have a lot to handle: they have to gather a lot of different resources and money to be able to buy these actions and help build the castle. Turn angst is very tense in this game and there is a wonderful turn order mechanic.
A game of Caylus is a great experience. It's constant pressure and demanding gameplay is both wonderful and exhausting. This alone makes it a great game. I also like the very colourful components.

Incredibly fun, initially complex but easy to play once you get it down. Scoring can be a nightmare because you need to keep track of the points you get from other players using your buildings. It is the only thing you cannot add up just by looking at the board. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
What an awesome game!  There are a bunch of neat mechanics at play here, as the turn order varies and even turn length, since the sooner someone passes, the more expensive it is for everyone else, thereby cutting their turns short.  The building track seems to be at the core of the game, although I think the castle and favors add some nice tension.

UPDATE: I think the other element that is fascinating with this one is how which buildings actually provide benefits are set by the players. You can burn some actions to ensure that you get the benefit of the buildings, which is a costly tradeoff. Also, the order in which players pass affects when players pay to move the track, which is another aspect to this unique mechanic. Truly a classic.

There's no luck beyond the initial building selection. The idea is that players are builders helping to build the king's castle (3 parts: dungeon, keep, and towers or something like that). You use initial buildings (place your workers, in turn) to generate resources, which you use to build better buildings (which generate more/better resources or help in other ways) and to build parts of the castle. Scoring happens when each of 3 stages of the castle are done, or when the game timer marches forward to specific intervals (player actions can affect this speed). In addition to producing resources, buildings/workers can change turn order, reduce the cost of placing other workers, and earn king's favors. You also earn favors each turn by contributing the most to the castle that turn. What are favors? Well, little freebies - ways to get extra resources, or build buildings more easily, or extra cash, or extra VPs. When the game ends (castle complete, or game timer moves to end), most VP wins (unused resources and cash are also worth some VP). 

Sure, this is a good game, but is it THAT good? I don't think so. I think I'd prefer a bit more randomness in the game - more than just the initial shuffle of the pink buildings. The game is good, but I have more fun with other games.

I... well, I really, really wanted to like this.  But it's just not all that engaging.  It's also dreadfully unintuitive.  A good game shouldn't feel like you have to learn a new language and dutifully study it in order to be even mediocre.  I'll leave this one to everyone who seems to feel it's God's gift to boardgamers, and stick to Puerto Rico -- you know, that game that's really deep, strategically engaging, and INTUITIVE.  Can't stress that last bit enough.Who knows, this rating may change with further plays... I'm just not overly inclined to try again.Another play in person, a couple on BSW, and I still feel this is drastically overrated.  I just don't get love.

It is a great worker placement, but was a bit fiddly with all the components. While I liked that the turn order changed, it also got a bit frustrating as it was easy to forget your turn was next. 

I think I need to play this game a few more times to really take in everything.

This is the most beautifully elegant game I've ever played.  It has everything I enjoy about eurogames and more.  It can be played brutally cutthroat or fast and hard.  Of course, if you'd prefer to slow it down to duke it out with your opponents, you can do that too.

I've had most of my experience with the 2p game, and I've enjoyed every minute of it.  Your mistakes cost dearly.  There's zero luck and there's always room for improvement.

RATING: N/A
Too much repeated decisions along the game.

Stupid mechanics like provost/bailif, some unbalanced buildings.

One of the things I don't like in this game is the lack of strategy in medium/long term and the time of play. It could be for over 3/4 hours!!!
Another thing I don't like about the game is the backstabing. You just can't take things too serious, or else you're going to get very, very upset.

Pushed the rate up to a seven after playing it again (2-01-2009) and realised that it's a bit faster than in our first plays. Still lots of repeated decisions and a bit boring mainly because of that.

Against the odds I ended up liking this game better now than when I first played it. I recognize the brilliancy of the worker placement mechanism that originated  a few better games and a bunch of worse ones. Worker placement became one of the most used and preferred mechanics and it all started with Caylus. 

UPDATE:
I find the one coin payement a very annoying rule that somehow doesn't seem polished enough. I feel the age of the game mainly in this particular aspect - feel the same about the coin in Antike
Just like in the beggining much of the game feels repetitive but I still enjoy it enough and would like to occasionaly play it!

I've played with 2, 3, & 5. Seems too fiddy, with the bits moving all over. However could be better once everyone playing knows how to play already and can manage their own bits.

There is one point that set this game apart from many other eurogames as Agricola or Puerto Rico. You can hurt your opponent not only by blocking his wanted action but even after he got it by other measures. Therefore it is less of a more play solitaire than most of the other Euro Games.

Caylus is the 500-pound gorilla of Eurogames: long, unwieldy and full of imbalances and rough edges. All stuff I generally dislike in games, but in Caylus, it somehow falls together pretty well. The game has very few random factors and instead offers the players the possibility to determine the game flow by choosing which buildings to erect.
The production buildings are sometimes said to be too important, but I'm not sure whether I agree. Then again, I've played only a few games, so what do I know of strategy? I'm still having fun trying to figure that out.
I used to rate this a 10, but downgraded it because of its excessive length. I wouldn't want to play this anymore with more than 3, unless all players are *really* fast.

The gold standard for worker placement games.

Caylus is one of the first eurogames I bought; and I bought it purely on the strength of its core feature: the holy trinity of road, provost and bailiff. I still think it's one of the very best worker placement -- which is to say, action-drafting -- games ever made. Some particularly enjoyable features are the ability to build over early production buildings, the variable-length queue and its implications on both building placement and action timing, and the ever-looming spectre of the castle. There are multiple viable strategies and many opportunities for screwage.

It can inspire AP and it does have the potential to run slightly long, but it's a brilliant design that holds up extremely well against its many imitators.

--

I had thought the new wave of worker placement blah blah blah games did not live up to the standards set by classics like this one, but picking it up again for a dozen plays after a year of dust-gathering was a disappointment.

Oh, it's still an excellent design and still better than most of its imitators. But some elements are clunky -- like scoring points for placement on buildings -- and it tends to ever so slightly outstay its welcome. Such tension as there is derives from tedious, indirect competition; the denial aspect of the road is perhaps the most interesting part, but it doesn't go quite far enough -- the systems in Vanuatu is an example of a far better take on the same principle.

Mostly what I am saying is that my tastes have changed. All that slog through resource collection etc. -- it just isn't interesting enough to deserve its length.

A great game that really makes you think, but without incredibly cumbersome mechanics.  This game, like Puerto Rico, requires a lot of looking ahead and planning which I really like.  The mechanics also do a good job of keeping the game balanced right up until the end, so things stay tight and tense.  This is one of those games you have to play several times to discover all the different strategies that are available.  Looking forward to playing it some more.

Played thrice on BSW.  I've loved it so far, and I'm sure I'd like it more on a real board.  Those that say it's 100% tactics don't have the capacity for abstract thought (thus the all or nothing 100% BS.) Your over-arching strategy makes a huge difference, but, the game requires flexibility and decent tactics.  It may not be as cleanly designed as some, but to me that it is not a necessity for a game to be great.  Caylus has balance for multiple strategies, and the combination of ideas is excellent.  Oh, and the playing time can easily be 90 minutes to 2 hours.  Any more is ridiculous and shouldn't be happening.

Played twice on a real board.  So long I want to kill myself.  Has almost ruined the game for me.  I still kinda like it.

Theme is pasted on.  Fairly easy to learn and play.  Game play is like work and similar to many eurogames.  Similar game mechanics include worker placement, building with resources, and variable turn order.  However, tile placement along a track is a new mechanic and somewhat interesting.  Game play is well balanced.  Game length is longer than typical eurogames, but OK.  Components are of excellent quality.

Based on many plays.  This is a great game. This is just the sort of game I really like, with good depth, very calculating and low luck. Resource management games are my favorite type of game.  I also like how different each game can be, it has a lot of replay value.  There are so many different paths a person can take to win it. In the plays I have had with this game has drew nothing but praise from those I played it with.  It has immediately become a hot game for my gaming group and one that we will probably be playing a lot this next year. This game has become my most requested game to borrow or play.  The cons to this game is that can take a long time, a bit longer than some like.  Also it can be a difficult game of new players to compete well against experienced players in.

RATING: 7
[RGG 2005 First Edition w/ replacement coins] {City building, economic; resource-management, variable-player-order, variable-building-powers} Caylus is a good game; esp. for those who like Euro games.  It is elegant, multifaceted and well balanced.  It is surely well play-tested. It is very dynamic; therefore, deep analyzing is not necessary. However, it caters for both tactical options and strategic planning.

Player interaction is strong because the buildings are shared among the players and players have to compete for their functions. It's heavy - players have to focus and make many agonizing decisions. It is better than Puerto Rico in one aspect: the player order can change during the game.  Therefore, it does not suffer from the painful sitting order problem like PR does.

The theme is ok but not as vivid as PR or E&T. The board is colorful and informative but not attractive. The building tiles are informative, too.

In all, it's a good strategy game but it is not 'fun' for me as other strategic games. 

This is very great attempt for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work, William!

RATING: 8
Oof.  I have a hard time determining how I feel about Caylus.

I think the game itself is fantastic.  This is one of the best "multiple paths to victory" Euro-games I've seen.  The worker placement mechanics work extremely well, there is a constant scarceness of resources and money that keeps the game tense, and the fact that you earn points from opponents using your buildings (and vice versa) adds an amazing amount of tactics and strategy to the game.  The board is pretty, the provost mechanic adds some important interaction, the bailiff keeps the game from reaching a stalemate...  I can't imagine the amount of work that went into perfecting the design on Caylus.

That said, I don't enjoy playing it very often.  I think the main problem is this: there are very few other games I have seen that inspire quite as much analysis paralysis as Caylus.  I think the game itself is partly to blame by its design: the fact that you don't get resources until the end of the turn, and you need very specific combinations of resources to work on the castle means that people spend countless minutes dithering "Wait, by this point I'll have two cloth and three stone, and then I'm trading the stone for two food, and... wait, let me start over."  

I don't think I will -ever- agree to five-player Caylus again without a chess clock or something.  I like Caylus a lot, but it should be at most a ninety-minute game; past that I'm getting jittery and bored with it.  Unfortunately, it can tend to go onto two to two-and-a-half hours, and I just don't find it interesting enough to keep my attention that long.

So, in summary: fantastic game, needs to come packaged with turn timers.

COLORBLINDNESS NOTE: The "food" and "stone" cubes are pretty hard to distinguish.  This is even worse on the buildings where the tiny pink and grey cubes are in the costs--it can take some squinting and good lighting to tell these apart.  Might want to mark these up or ask other players.

Additionally, I have played Caylus approximately a hundred times on Brettspielwelt. Used to be hooked in 2005 and 2006. Did not get many plays lately because there are so many other great new games out there.
I think the only reason why this one is rated worse than Puerto Rico on BGG is probably its longer playing time.

My previous comment got deleted while saving and I don't have patience...Good game, much better IMO than PR.  I don't know if it would have legs for me to play 20+ games, but I think I'd enjoy the next 5.

Edit:  You know what, though?  Chris Farrell is largely right about the game--it's more about figuring out things like "is it worth spending a guy so I can go first next turn to build a stone production building" than "is it worth building a stone production building".  And that lack of tension in where you want to put your guys in a turn is kind of surprising in a game with so many choices.

I do think this could be an interesting 2-player game with the Provost becoming more important.

This one was falling off for me a bit, but some recent plays have moved it back to a 9. Played again on 4/29/09 I really do love this game. So many ways to score super chunky play that allows for some nice combos and big point swing moves.

So many options, and so little resources... This game is the embodied agonizing decision. Did I place my worker correctly? Do I have enough resources? Will I be able to build? Brilliant game, but with a steep learning curve. I like it especially because it is completely independent of luck.

The game is very elegant, but I'm very, very bad at it.  I always feel like I'm coming to play in an orchestra with a kazoo.

This has quickly become my new favourite board game. What I like about it is the fact that there's 0 luck involved - it's all about strategy. And that there are so many options, so many different roads to victory.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Worker Placement - Medieval - Luckless - 2-5 players - 2h

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] Great tense & meaty game.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Excellent. Still good after hours of play.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

A very solid design that leaves nothing to chance.

Players add buildings to the road and supply resources for the king's castle for victory points. You will constantly find yourself jockeying for position, either for the turn order, the resources or special buildings, or to be the first to offer batches of resources to the king to get ever more powerful favors. Once people start passing, everything becomes more expensive - except your own buildings. Provided, of course, that somebody else didn't already use it.

If the theme doesn't sound exciting for you, I can tell you the game when played by serious players is always tense. There is no single route to victory; the huge special buildings give many points, but cost a lot of resources and effort to buils - in my more recent experience this is not always worthwhile.

A monumental game by Ystari.

RATING: 7
Worker placement game with a medieval building theme. Players select actions by placing their workers onto buildings on the board, which allow the gathering of resources or the use of those resources to construct further buildings. These new building serve as action selections in future turns and bestow the owner victory points when used. Over the course of the game more and more actions become available and players can assist in constructing the castle, leading to the primary way of obtaining victory points. What stands this game apart from many similar efforts is the Provost, which is used to prevent players from obtaining the benefits of the actions they have taken and brings an interesting amount of player interaction into the game. When first released 'Caylus' was an innovative game which has over the years led to many imitators, but at the time of writing nearly a decade after its original release it doesn't quite posses the attraction of some of the games it spawned.

Played 5+ times. First game out was a long drawn out ordeal at midnight.  The second time to the table was much better.  There are a tonne of rules to explain to new players, but the symbols on the board and components are quite good (could have been a bit bigger).  There's a lot of choice and each game develops differently, but you don't need to know every building and it's pro's and con's to play well in your first game.  I think it takes just a bit longer than I'd like, but that should go down with less rules explaining. Rating will probably go up. Update: last game played in 2 hours including rules explanation. **UPDATE** Played very well with 2.  Still very tight game and despite one person being able to completely monopolize the provost there was still a lot of provost action. 2006/03/17

One of the most brilliantly designed games EVER, in my opinion, let alone among worker placement games.  Incredibly balanced, thinky, zero-luck game with superb player interactivity, that is relatively easy to learn and pick up after a long layoff.  Some minor quibbles: it is a tad dry, and it is prone to AP in the later stages of the game as the number of resources you have to manage, or plan for, increases.  This is the kind of game where you really need to pay attention to and anticipate your opponents' moves.  If a player isn't good at doing that, they are going to lose badly every time.  Plays very well at all levels -- 2, 3, or 4 players.

Essen Math trade 2011.

UPDATE: Finally played this one. What to say about it. 
Is it a good game? Yes.
Did we had a fun time? Meh, it was ok.
Do I see the replay value? Defenitely.
Will it get replayed? Defenitely not.

Why not? In its heart, Caylus is another soulles cube pushing euro. It might be one of the best balanced games, but as the area it is in is very crowded I have lots of other games I'd prefer over it. Also because it is almost completely devoid of theme. 

If I want a nice Euro, I grab Macao or Puerto Ricoh.
If I want a touch of medieval Europe, I'll grab Kaiser, Fief!, Princes of Florance or Traders of Genoa instead.
And most of all, on all points Caylus has been superseded by one of my favorite games: Carson City. 

There is absolutely no reason for me to keep this one.

However. If you do not own that many games and are looking for one of the best euros with a great replayability, Caylus might be just your thing. Well balanced, engaging gameplay and a very clear game-board. Just don't expect any meaningful theme.

Sold it off in Aug 2013 for €25,-

RATING: 1
Impossible for a low-vision player.

Resources are represented by 5 different colored tiny cubes, some of which are difficult to distinguish in normal light. Worse yet, the colors are printed on tiny game cards in tiny boxes, so it is difficult to scan the board to see what buildings cost / yield what.

Even the currency pieces appear to go out of their way to make "1" hard to distinguish from "5."

As others have correctly mentioned, the rule book is a nightmare -- it would be much easier to learn from someone else.

Not a bad game, but I fear Captain Excitable has been working his wicked ways with some voters. 

Good solid gamer's fare, but can be prone to very long games. And not a lot of fun either. Essentially a Richard Breese design with knobs on.

And just to head off any major ructions, or god forbid another Settlers backlash: I gave it a seven, now a six, I like the game and it is clever, but like PR, Louis Quartorze, Goa and some of Richard Breese's games, it has that curious damped structure - tight, ordered, rather dry, process heavy, studious feel. So, not my style of game. That's all.

This is beginning to grow on me. I bought it only recently and was concerned it would not hold up to newer games or hold my attention post Feld. And I don't think it does but only just. After 5 plays I've also noticed that an early leader is very difficult to dislodge. Not a runaway leader problem, games are always tight, but even with 4 of us playing someone has been able to correctly call the finishing positions after 4 or 5 turns.

Take a bit of Puerto Rico style and Keythedral mechanics, shake theme adding many original high interaction/modular mechanics and you'll have this great game with tons of things to choose with few of them realizable, an amazing background and a wonderful design. Deeper interaction! No downtime! the game strategy is always changing, starting from the number of players. The positioning of the workers is the central mechanic that is mainly a tactic challenge beetwen players.

I bought this after having played Agricola as I wanted another game with similar mechanics. It doesn't compare at all.. Caylus to me seems to be very dry and lacks the quantity of decisions Agricola has, the variety and more importantly the immersion. In Agricola the actions I take in the game actually make sense from a "role-playing" perspective.. in Caylus I don't get good a sense of who I am and where I fit in the bigger picture.

I have now played this game 4 times and I must admit it is a solid game.  The biggest detractor is that the length is a bit long.  If this could be completed in two hours it would be one I would pull out more often.  The choices can sometimes be agonizing as you try to balance completing your own agenda while keeping the other players from completing thiers.  If only the time were shorter...

Dropped from 7.5 to 6.5 on 11/16/07

Dropped due to inability to get to the table as often, and I personally also look to other games first due to length of time.

I gave Caylus more than a fair chance because of its high rating on BGG, but I just can't stand the game.  I can't quite pinpoint my problem -- it might be the fact that you buy communal buildings; it might be that the strength of the favor seems too high to me; it might be the strong tactical focus.  I don't really know, but I just have a visceral dislike of Caylus when I'm playing.

After one play I can see, why many herald this as the new Puerto Rico. There exactly lies the problem: While I enjoy Puerto Rico from time to time, it never really was popular with my group.

It was was Caylus at 1 hour and 15 minutes, it would be a nearly perfect game.  3 years later and it's holding its value.

This will likely continue to change as I play more - it started as a 9.5, then 9, now 8.5.  That said, a wonderful game, with meaningful and tense decisions, difficult money and resource management, and practically no downtime.  Like Goa, you want (and even need!) to do everything, but don't have the resources to do it.  Rules are simple and elegant.  Time just flies by when playing, which is one of the highest compliments that can be paid.  Minor quibble - the money sucks (fixed in the 2nd edition).

Update - Absolutely bombed when I tried to introduce it to my newish game group.  The one other 'true gamer' in the group immediately took a liking to Caylus, the rest couldn't figure it out regardless of how many sample turns we took.  Downgraded to 7 - if I need only "true gamers" in order to play, it will not see as much play as one would like.

Update - Downgraded to 6.  A minor move, sure, but every time I'm putting together a collection of games to bring to game night, I look at Caylus, think about it, and say "Nah."  I still like the game, and personally it's probably a 7 for me, but if I can never get it to the table, and furthermore know I [i]won't[/i] get it to the table...then it isn't as good as it could otherwise be.

Update - Downgraded to 5.5.  An even more minor move, but man, when I was at BGG.con, we checked out Caylus, set it up, and then were like...nah.  Put it back in the box, and back into the game room.  Nothing more needs to be said.

03 DEC 2010 - Brutal, brutal game. The part that is toughest for me is remembering what order you get stuff in - forget this and you can screw yourself horribly. I love all the different ways you can score points (and the way you can really mess with someone - just make sure they can't retaliate or you will regret it....)

I have only played 2-player and it has always been a very close game. Would love to play with more sometime.

Very similar to Puerto Rico in the sense that I had the same feeling when playing it: It is a good game, but too dry and mechanical. 
Not a top 10 game if you ask me. The other Ystari games I played are much more enjoyable even if they have lower ratings.

Wow.

Amended rating - Wow, what a turnaround! I initially started out with this as a 9.5. Over time, my enthusiasm has dropped to the point where I would probably not be overly disappointed if I never played Caylus again. Far too long and repetetive for what it is, as many have pointed out. I think one other aspect that bothers me is that I go through time and effort to gather materials to build a certain type of building, and once it is built, it belongs to everyone. I get no pride of ownership, no veto power so I can guarantee myself the use of "MY" building. There is an illusion of control over what I can build and what path I choose to take to victory, but in the end I really have very little control over what happens due to the chaotic nature of all players scrambling over the common pool of resources. While this is a good thing in the eyes of many players, it is just not for me.

RATING: 10
Caylus strikes the right balance between player interaction, buildings (actions), and point optimization that subsequent worker-placement games commonly screw up (I'm looking at you Le Havre). The game is a bit inelegant what with the four favor tracks and 10 separate turn phases. But it has depth and tension.

The game is clearly at its best with 3-4 players. With two, the the provost is effectively out of the game. With five, it's too chaotic. I also wonder if the game shouldn't be a bit shorter.

UPDATE: I find myself wanting to play Caylus more and more. I've increased my rating to 8. Four players is my sweet spot: a perfect balance between chaos and control. The game length is also significantly reduced with experience. Caylus drives me crazy trying to balance my long-term goals against my short-term needs. The clincher, however, is that I find myself worrying about everyone else's actions as well, which heightens the tension and increases my enjoyment. A very good game in a genre I'm not typically fond of.

RATING: 8
Whoo boy there are a lot of decisions to be made in Caylus.  You have to manage resources and money, but the heart of the game seems to be timing everything correctly.  Everything from gathering resources just in time to build, getting into the Inn just when you really need low cost workers, to the very important (and very changeable) turn order.  The flow of the game is easy to wrap your mind around, but not all of the subtle timing issues.  Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
At a first glance Caylus is a complex game of construction and economy. It may be a little bit daunting for the non-gamer but somebody with some experience it is fairly easy to learn and play. The object of the game is to score prestige-points by contributing to the construction of the king's castles and the accompanying town. There are many ways to score points, and several long term and short term strategies emerge.

There are many rules and effects, but all of these can be 'read' from the symbols on the board. The game mechanics are nice and simple and the system as a whole is balanced. As an added bonus, it plays relatively well with two player, even though it is better to play with the maximum of five.

RATING: 8
Probably the first really long board game I've ever played. Very enjoyable, although we found that playing with the maximum number of players made it very difficult to get much of anything done for quite a while. Still, plenty of strategy, lots of room to screw over your friends, and an overall very good game.

RATING: 8.6
Worker placement with unique mechanics, high level of interaction, different strategic options and high levels of tension? I'm sold. Being able to make worker placement locations that opponents have to pay you to move, riskier spots that you can shut down when your opponent tries to use it, resource management - just a really good all rounder.

It seems to me that this plays virtually identically to the expanded card game. Something about it makes me marginally prefer Magna Carta though. Perhaps it's just the fact that this is the version I played first, so the full game now just seems like a weird copy of it, with extraneous components. Or maybe it's just that I'm biased because I own the card game. :)

Had a great initial run with the group, and has since (after 20 plays) fallen out of heavy rotation. Has a great second life as a two-player filler, and in fact is the favorite way to play for some in the group. Playtime got down to under two hours for our group, so I can't relate to all the complaining about game time.

Update: We now play Magna Carta more often than Caylus, but I still like this for two players...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wow. This is easily the best game of 2005. Extremely well balanced without negating the huge number of strategic and tactical decisions available to players - the balance has been achieved in the relative values of the different options and trade-offs in pursuing different viable choices rather than any artifical leveling mechanism. For me, this is similar in "weight" - i.e., game length and complexity - to Goa and just as rewarding an experience, among only a handful of 2-plus-hour games that have captured my interest to this extent. Give this one a try!

Very interesting game, many paths to victory.  I can see why this is rated highly.  Time will tell if it has staying power.

Also, with 5, the game is far too random.  Ganging-up on a player by moving the provost is quite common and makes for a much less enjoyable game.

Interesting worker placement with an additional "blocking option" built in for additional screw-you - which can alternatively be used to accelerate the game to the end.

After 5 sessions I have to downgrade this slightly. While it's still a great game, it just takes too long. We haven't had one game which took us shorter than 3 1/2 hours. And personally, if I want to play a long game, I prefer TI 3rd edition or "A game of thrones". Those games just feel more tense.

Learning all of the rules of this game is a bitch.  There are a hundred little details to "stub your toe" on during gameplay.  Once you've played a game or two, though, you get the hang of it.

One of my favorite games. Many people don't like it because it is kind of a "more experience the better" situation. But most strategy games are. If you play with a certain group over and over again then this game ages quite well. I think that is how you should think of this game. I have played this game with the same people and over the course we grow with the game. It's like watching a classic Chaplin movie. If you walk into the theater complaining about it being in black and white and silent...then you miss the point completely. Please give it a chance because it can bring a lot of love and hate to your gaming sessions

Fantastic game with great strategy that exhibits many pathways to victory.  The game is simply a victory-point exercise through the procurement and utilization of resources.  But the game play can vary widely game after game, and you may need to adjust your strategy midway.  Keeping focused on a goal, and not having that interupted (which is not very easy) seems to be the pathway to victory.

9/29/2016: The classic worker placement game, Caylus has players building a path of city buildings up to a castle.  Each building has a different action, and players may gain benefits if another player uses a building they own.  Tighter game than Lords of Waterdeep but also pretty straightforward.

First Impression: 

Worker Placement at its best.

The game is deep, the interaction is high, the options great and well balanced, and although there is a sense of accomplishment there is no (or limited) economic snowball. The provost (or however its called) is a mechanic that I particularly loved.

This is a cutthroat game. Player bashing is at certain opportunities available, but the target player must usually ask for it by taking the risk. There is also blocking and rushing the end and other opportunities to hurt players. I can see a certain category of players to dislike this, but in all honesty, I like it even more for this!.

I really liked Caylus, and to me it seemed much more fresh than I expected. A very good cutthroat game, I look forward to playing more.

My stepfather loves this one.  It's similar to Agricola and puerto rico in one notable mechanic:  You play down a person to do an action.  Thats your major interaction with other players.  However players can pay to move a little man up and down the path to block your actions you have paid for.  Your also suppose to be building onto the castle, but that feels like an after thought.

Fantastic game with three.  Very good with two.  I don't care for the five player game, but thats ok.  The way different styles of play can compete with each other is great to watch and participate in.  Deciding on which style to play is also a great time.  10 plays in, and still learning a great deal every time I play.  After every game, it is possible to see which decisions you made caused you to win/lose.  I am addicted to this game right now.  I'm a sucker for games that force you to recognize what type of game this particular one will be.  Force you to adjust to the prevailing situations, and tweak your strategy.  Caylus has this, and why its a keeper.  

Its amazing how the early decisions create a different feeling game every time.

Really quite a good game to be had here. Not as good as others the buzz on this one seems quite a bit too high. I think maybe it's just a bit too long but also can't see a way to end it any sooner. So on one hand it's as long as it needs to be...just to me that drags out and gets feel a bit monotonous. 

UPDATE: After having played many games of Caylus Magna Carta now I have had to lower the rating on Caylus. I like what these games are doing but have found that I don't like Caylus at all anymore. If I want to play this system I'll play Magna Carta everytime. Bottom line if someone asks me to play Caylus...I'm going to say "no". However I will most likely always be willing to play Magna Carta.

I was skeptical of all the hype, but after playing Caylus ten times, I must admit that it's an absolutely outstanding game.  There are a lot of different variables to keep track of, but the game is surprisingly elegant.  I'm learning new things about the gameplay each time, and enjoying the game more each time I play it.  I really can't say enough about Caylus, except that you really must try it out and see for yourself.

Another Meh game for me.  Hyped all to hell so I finally played it.  Don't remember where I finished, but I'm sure it wasn't first.  Nobody in my game group bothers bringing it, so it'll be a while before I get to make a final rating decision.

Pillars of the Earth has been called "Caylus-lite".  I'm inclined to agree and would probably prefer Pillars to this.

The king (a-ha) of strategic gameplay. Wow. No luck (other than that bastard player that insists in going where you want to go and keeps pushing the provost further) in a playing time of about 120-180 minutes.

Well, this game is around long enough, if you want to learn more, go read some reviews (and thumb them! - if they are good).

RATING: 7
Playing this after Caylus Magna Carta; I like Caylus better. Tiles look better than cards and also get rid of the random draws from personal decks, and increase the feeling of competition over a limited resource. Lack of cards also means that every action in Caylus is placing a worker somewhere, which is simpler than having some actions involve your cards.

The "micro-move" feel of CMC that I disliked is mitigated by the feeling that Caylus has a better-defined arc and long term strategy. Players collectively build up a city, almost with the feel of an economic game, and I can see this more clearly in Caylus.

The chicken game of moving the provost is not my favorite, but it's at least clear what's going on. I do think it stunts the growth of the city as players may be afraid to use buildings that might not get to work. Only a few (I think exactly three) buildings give both the building owner and the building user a perk at the time the building gets to activate.

Overall, for now, I think Caylus is preferable to Puerto Rico (because it's less opaque) and Agricola (because the interaction is more interesting).

It's clear.  The Worker placement game to define the rest.  Once learned, everything falls in place, and the game moves along with fine form and ease.  

Oh yes, well one more thing, this can create some conflict, if you have sensitive players.... but alas are you playing for the King's prestige or the real human that you have to deal with on a day to day basis who makes idol threats if you get in the way of his/her path?

An incredible resource management game that has enough unique elements to allow it to stand out from this crowded market. Some people complain Caylus has an "answer", but preventing other players from getting everything they need isn't that hard. Not very newbie friendly for that reason though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Oh, I love this game! There are so many decisions to balance. The decisions are both meaningful and fun. I constantly have to think about what my opponents are going to do. As with most worker placement, some of that is of the form, "I need cloth, and my opponent needs cloth. Is he going there next?" However, many of the choices feel much weightier. The jousting arena is amazing but you assess your opponent's ability to use it effectively. Your opponent just gained the spot that lets him move the provost (or the bailiff, I never tell those apart). Does that mean he wants to play forward, and I can follow him? Or is trying to reign everyone in for a round? The only complaint I have is that it can be hard to look at the board after a long game and tell what you've accomplished.

I've played this game a couple of times, and won both times with completely different strategies. Contrary to what everyone says, I didn't think there was a lot of brain burn, if you're focused on your approach to winning the game. Yes, there are a lot of initial options, but as far as pursuing your strategy, the choices narrow themselves down quite a bit.

Very enjoyable. Can't wait to play more!

Initial impression from BGG.CON ... definitely an intriguing game and the road brings interesting mechanics.  That said, I was disappointed and a little turned off by several things, including the length of the game and the graphics on the game board.  The game seemed to be pretty dry, an exercise in acquiring little colored cubes to convert to victory points that would be more interesting if the game was an hour shorter.

Raising rating especially for how well this plays as a two player game.  Getting lots of plays on BSW and the biggest problem of the game (length) is managable in a two player setting.  However, I really like 4-5 players better, but then you have time issues, so it's not a 9 or 10 for me.

Downgraded to a 6 as I learned more about optimal strategies on BSW.  Prefer AoE III for my "action selection" Euro, though I love the idea behind the buildings.  Some game needs to refine this shared building concept into a less scripted package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.8
Simply the best modern euro game.  I play this online all the time.  The game has layers man.  So much tension.  A marvel of design.  Try to exploit the system with two tensions hanging over you, the provost and the need to win in the castle constantly or fall behind.  

Unlike other euro games where the managing of resources is arbitrary, this game forces you to pay careful attention to your money and your cubes.  That is what separates Caylus from the other euros in which you simply cleverly convert stuff into other stuff and figure out puzzles.  In Caylus, you use the resources to control the position!  You use the efficiency game to control the positional game.  If you lose either game, you are done for.  

You use the resources and the threats they represent to influence what the other players can and can't do.  This combined with the reward of building better and better buildings with which to make a pseudo-engine makes for the finest modern euro ever made.

The power of the modern euro to provide FEEDBACK, i.e build buildings and score points is what makes them so popular.  The fact that there is a DEEP and elegant game involved is what separates Caylus from the pretenders to the throne.  A castle for a king indeed.  

Decisions per minute is huge in this game.  Agonizing decisions per minute is huge.  All the decisions are interesting in trying to find what you earn and what you give up and gain positionally.

Nothing comes close.  Caylus is the finest of its class.  If you like to build stuff and manipulate a system and manipulate tempo, you need this game.

A worker placement game that isn't just tactical, but has a solid strategic underpinning.

I like it as a 3-player game.  2 players are too few for the game's strategy space and 4 or 5 player games both can become too "political" for my taste and are just a bit too long for what is a "fixed fun" game.

I've played this face to face once, with some players who had played dozens of times.  I was overwhelmed, didn't have a good idea of what buildings were available to build, or what strategic paths to explore.  I blame this mostly on bad teaching, not a bad game.

I've played it a few times on BSW as well, and it just doesn't meet my fancy.  I find the bailiff too cutthroat, and the learning curve to understand the interplay of buildings too complicated.

I am willing to give it another try, and to have my opinion changed.

RATING: 8
Not as hard to get my head around the rules as i thought it would be and the 11 year old son has coped fine with it.  I think the real heavy learning curve is the working out how best to score points and prevent your opponent from doing same rather than the game mechanics.  I love this game and cant praise it highly enough for its immersive quality and its variation.

Great game with tons of options each round and agonizing decision making with regard to the priority given to resource allocation. It is just impossible to perform all the actions you want each turn, because resources (workers, money) are tight and you take turns choosing actions (and each available action can only be chosen by a single player each turn). Has an addictive quality to it, which makes me look forward to my next game.
However, to compare it to the likes of Puerto Rico --- I do not know. I guess it is much too early to tell. Playing relatively fast with just three players, it took us 4.5 hours to complete! And that is about an hour too long in my honest opinion. We will see how often it will hit the table given its playing time.

This is a very complicated game. The rules are clean and the game play is very tight and I love the different options for scoring points, both at the castle and in the village.

Now I'm a degenerate, cube-fondling eurosnoot, and this game has elements I go for:

Coloured resource cubes, a-lingual tiles to be placed, an esoteric bidding system to determine player order and a mediaeval king to suck up to.

But it has no soul, no joy, no pleasure, no sense of achievement. It's a  mind-numbing, multi-dimensional spreadsheet of a game. Imagine being a clerk hand-writing actuary tables in a Victorian insurance company for forty years.You've just played Caylus.

I really, really, REALLY want to like this game, but I don't. Hell, even the man on the box lid looks like he wants nothing to do with it!

I played this at BGG.CON, and it would be a 9 if it took an hour less to play, but it doesn't.  It is still a very good game, and an engrossing way to spend three hours or so.  There is alot to choose from, and the game options change as the game progresses, which helps make the game length more bearable.  Still, this is not a game that would come out often.

After more plays, I have decided that this game is right on the edge of how much effort I am willing to put into a game.  Beyond this, it would become work.  More theme would help keep the interest up, which is why Twilight Imperium also straddles this same edge.

Quando comentei sobre Tzolk'in, escrevi que acreditava ser o melhor "Worker Placement" q provavelmente jogaria. Bem não sei se me enganei, mas no mínimo Caylus chega tão perto que é difícil escolher.
Pra falar a verdade, nem sei o motivo, por mais que seja antigo, com a jogabilidade visivelmente um pouco lenta e travada as vezes, Caylus tem algo que me atrai muito.
Pra começar, o fato de não ter a mecânica de "alimentar trabalhadores", que eu acho q atrapalha diversos jogos do estilo. Acho ruim, ter que sempre lembrar de guardar moedas/comida para alimentar trabalhadores, a mim parece uma mecânica a parte, não fazendo parte do jogo original.
Outra coisa que me atrai é o fato de, apesar de claramente existir umas opções mais vantajosas que outras, todas elas têm o mesmo valor de 1 moeda, cabendo à dinâmica do jogo e dos jogadores, além da ordem de jogo decidir qual vale mais a pena pegar primeiro.
Por último, as construções feitas ao longo da "estrada" dão uma rejogabilidade muito boa, além de (junto com o castelo) dar a sensação que algo está sendo construído por vc.
Enfim, ainda considero Tzolk'in um jogo mais completo, com estilo diferenciado, mas Caylus não deixa nada a dever e tem elementos de um jogo simples e ao mesmo tempo complexo do tipo "esquenta-mufa" que eu adoro.

Sure, it's nothing but the latest tactical and processional optimization puzzle, but it's a very engrossing puzzle, and thus easy to overdose on.

If the resource and money favor tracks had been slightly bulked up, this could have had more staying power to go along with the initial period of infatuation.  Someday, I'd like to try some new values for those tracks.  EDIT:  I've been spending my last few games working the goods track almost exclusively, mainly to try and prove myself wrong/challenge myself, and it's working well.

Played one 5 player game. I found it sort of pleasantly dull. It's really well designed, and it's an amazing accomplishment that such a long game can seem rather short. However, more and more I find that slow, incremental games built around not being able to do what you want because the actions you need have already been selected just aren't my idea of a good time. It's the same problem I have with Puerto Rico, though I think Caylus runs a bit better and is more interesting just to watch play out.

The second play was a bit better. The more of these types of games I play the more I learn the importance of being flexible. Still not my cup of tea, but I can enjoy playing it.

Money always seems to be scarce because you need to pay for your action which could be costly due to the actions taken by other players.  It is a longer game so only one play a night is recommended if there are 4-5 players.  This will hit the spot, then go to a few lighter fare games.  Good artwork and board design in this game.

Estratégico, sesudo con azar 0 y donde los errores se pagan caros. Hay mil formas para ganar. Mecánica sencilla pero curva de aprendizaje un pelín complicada. Diserto con que es un juego mejor a 2 jugadores. Todo lo contrario, a 2 apenas se masca el peligro y a más jugadores se respira muchísima más tensión, se interactua y se hace más interesante al empezar el preboste en un baile que no sabes donde va a acabar. Cosa que a 2 apenas tiene movimiento.

RATING: 3
This game sucked! It was a pointless, and futile. Playing with more than 4 people takes a long time and it quickly becomes very boring. While playing, we ran into many problems. Strategizing could not happen until your turn arrived which then took a long time to figure out. There is a lot of waiting in this game and it is not for me.

RATING: 9
After first game with four players. Game is very good with many different strategies, but it is bit too long. Worker handling takes most of the time and when it is done fastly, playing time can be reduced significantly. I am very interested to see how playing evolves in next times. Updated after three plays to nine. Game is good and different every time, but still to long.

RATING: 8
Fantastic game, but all of a sudden it doesn't get on the table anymore. It will, I think, it just needs a little rest for now.
I like it best with 2 or 3 players, 4 is OK but 5 is too many because Caylus tends to last too long.

RATING: 8
It's embarrassing that I finally played this after being told (for years) how awesome it is. Even when compared to its descendants (ie, Agricola), Caylus holds up as a complex game that rewards intelligent play- and the occasional dirty deed.

Deployment costs make HR management trickier than in most games, and the variable player turn order is something I do not recall seeing in any other game so far. 

Being able to claim neutral space for your own war effort is also a really neat mechanic, as is the residual gain in prestige and/or resources when another player utilizes one of your buildings.

The game can seem tedious, because there is so much going on, but the more you play Caylus, the brighter it shines.

My favourite euro.  A great brain burner.  Multiple paths to victory with multiple ways to enable that.  I like how the players can dictate the flavour of the game by the order of buildings they bring out as well.

This game can also be played in a very confrontational and cut throat manner which I enjoy.

RATING: 6
This one is heavy, and has a fairly steep learning curve, so it is not for your casual game.  I didn't enjoy my first play that much, as I was nowhere near competing and did not grasp much of how things work.  My second play I fared much better, as the game concept finally started to sink in, but my decision making was still poor and I felt like I played kingmaker with my decisions.  The game can drag with new or AP players, but it is a very solid, heavy game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting but really heavy worker placement game with little hidden information and almost no luck. Enjoyable if you're looking for a brain-burner but not something I think would be easy for me to get to the table with my usual groups. Received in Montreal Mathtrade 2008 (for Tikal). Traded for "China" at Montreal Mathtrade February 2009.

Not sure if we'll get this now that we have both Le Havre and Agricola, but we'll think about it.

Grant got it for us.

This is lookin' like a very good game.  Pure euro.

This game has clawed its way to the top of our euro pile.  The ways that the players can manipulate the jobs (placement options for the workers) really sets this game apart from other worker placement games like Agricola or Dungeon Lords (both of which we enjoy).  The lack of randomness is a definite plus here.

There are a bunch of different paths to take during the game.  Afterwards, we're left with that great feeling of "yeah, if I had just done that differently I might of won" instead of feeling completely lost or that things just tend to average out in the long run.

A game that always leaves me thinking about other things I could've done differently after each game.  Nonstop tough decisions that keep things interesting.

Shows its age a bit - its definitely a bit too long, paying $1 with every worker placement is fiddley, the resource favor track is mostly garbage - but still a favorite.

I've been told this is a brutal game that crushes lives and spits them out. After playing it, I really didn't feel that way. It had some opportunities for hurting your opponents, but they were easy to recover from and required your opponents leave themselves open. The best ideas in Caylus have been stolen and reimplemented in other worker placement games that I'd rather play. I'm not saying Caylus isn't important, but it I prefer to play it's descendents.

Lives up to hype.  This is a very well designed game.

It can be a rough game the first time you play, because it is tough to envision exactly what you need, and often you end up being your own biggest opponent.  So far in my game sessions, the winner has always the person who makes the fewest blunders.  

I had friends that enjoyed playing this as a 2-player, and they said they could finish a game in 45 minutes.  My experience is that it is always a 2-3 hour game.

One of the best pure worker placement games after [gameid=22545], which is saying something in this increasingly crowded genre.  Lots of competition, and doesn't seem as much like multiplayer solitaire as some of the other games that use this mechanic.  This is certainly long and intense for a Euro, but it's got enough to make it worth it.  The decisions are so frequent and interesting that time flies when I play, and before I know it, the game's over and two hours have gone by.  Has a perfect amount of complexity for a game of its type.  I can see why this is loved by so many, and vilified by so many others.  Never has a game managed to be so perfectly balanced and full of great decisions while managing to have such a thin theme.

RATING: 10
This was the first heavy game I ever tried, our fourth acquisition, as we went from Fluxx to Killer Bunnies to Ticket to Ride to Caylus.

As such, this has been my "gold standard" of excellence, my #1 favourite and highest rated game. Every new game gets compared to Caylus, and so far, all have been found wanting. Some have come close, but Caylus is still the undisputed champ.

This is an amazingly deep game, yet at its core, so simple (crappy rulebook notwithstanding). Put your guys on the board, then in order, do what each spot says. And the spots are all so simple, collect this cube, turn this into that, the vast majority are only of a few different types (collect cubes, convert cubes, etc).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I like the challenge of figuring out what to build on each turn and keeping mind what resources you have on hand.  There are a lot of things to keep in mind like the time order of the events that happen.  I particularly like the  provost concept that moves the game along.  It's also nice that there is so little luck.

Rated after 5 games. A worker placement game, which would need more games for me to develop a winning strategy. There's quite a lot of different options and decisions to make per turn, so the game gets easily quite lengthy. I like the start of the game, but longer the game gets, more boring it gets.

Not a bad game, I can play this in the future, but I don't think worker placement games are the ones for me.

Despite my repeat attempts to play this on the iPad, and my acquisition of a physical copy to 'try to get into it', I still find Caylus desperately dry.

RATING: 9
To me, this game is akin to multiplayer chess. And, just like chess, you can have fun in casual play but, if you drill down into theory, you can really outpace your group.  The game has no luck, several ways to win and requires some sort of a long term strategy as well as an ability to adjust on the fly. Not a fan of it with 2 or 5 players, but 3 and 4 player games are extremely rewarding.

RATING: 6
I went through an initial love affair with the game, but with many repeated plays the game felt too long for how repetitive each turn was. At first, there is a fascination with all the different buildings and how the order in which they come up will effect the game. With repeated plays however this immense variability turns out to be more illusory- the real dynamic aspect of the game revolves around the competition for favors, and the provost and drafting mechanics integrate well into that sub-game. If you aren't playing that particular sub-game in a given turn then you are trying to compensate by using other peripheral methods, but as a general strategy their viability is questionable at best. Ultimately, Caylus is a game that offers real competition, but is a bit boring in how repetitive and dry it is. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Wow.  I thought this game was going to be too primitive, since I had played a lot of the games that came after it, but boy was I wrong.  This game is impressive.  The idea that the players build the "worker placement" locations is brilliant, and the provost mechanic and the special locations help keep things tense right up until the end.  

I really wish I had gotten into this game much earlier.  It has all of the good parts of the modern Euros, but has a very clean layout, easily understood iconography, and very evenly paced gameplay.

There's a lot going on in this game.  Possibly, there's more going on than I can track to enjoy it.  The design is elegant, though, and definitely requires multiple plays to get.

No other game has made me think and re-think my worker placement more than this.  I do not get APed but I'm constantly running decision chains in my head as each person places their worker.  Great game that I do not think I'll ever master.

Third play was three hours and we'd all played before: again, the game still overstayed it's welcome. This seems to me to be a decent game, but there are at least two or three games in my collection that I'd rather play at this point (if those games get "played out", then that may change). Also, it seems certain that Caylus has a strong kingmaker problem and thus a rather unstatisfying endgame.

This is a resource management game with a king's favor building theme.

This took a long time to get into for my first play, but it's a much easier game to play than the rule book's complex first impression.  It's just that there's a lot of depth to the choices to the game, which leads to delightfully agnoizing decisions.

This game is amazing, but not quite for me due to the crowd I play with. Even awesome zero-variance games (ok, Caylus isn't *quite* luck free but comes close) are still zero-variance, which means I win too much. Would love to play and study this if I found a hardcore group of gamers to play it with.

This is the father of all worker placement games and in a lot of ways, I think it has yet to be surpassed. Blocking opponents from taking actions has been done a thousand times since this game was released, but most modern worker placement games have gotten rid of any direct player interaction. Caylus has that in spades. Every build action affects what the other players can and will do, passing early raises the price of actions for everyone else and bribing the Provost creates all sorts of negotiations leading to a tense and delightfully spiteful game.

This and Go are, I think, the only two board games I've played that I think I may not be smart enough to do well at. Part of the problem with this one is that I play it so infrequently (three times since 2007) that I totally forget how to play and strategy in between. It's also fairly fiddly and there are a lot of really important things that are easy to overlook. Having said all that, something about this game makes me want to keep playing it and improve. It's a great intellectual challenge, more so than any other worker placement game I've played (though I have more fun playing, for example, Agricola). It is possible that it would get stale for me if I played it more often, but for now I'd rate it at the lower end of my favorites.

Edit: I've been realizing that, across all forms of entertainment, I tend to overrate things that I can appreciate aesthetically but don't enjoy. My previous rating/comment did not demonstrate that I have very low interest in actually playing this game.

Come per Puerto Rico, questo è un gioco che fa da spartiacque tra il prima e il dopo, soprattutto per quanto riguarda la gestione della azioni, qui fù il primo in cui si posizionano i propri segnalini e poi le azioni si eseguono in base al posizionamento, tutto bene oliato ed integrato.

I don't understand all of the hype on this game. I've only played twice, but neither time was what I'd call a "fun gaming experience." To me they've taken the elegance of Sackson's Bazaar and veiled all of the resource trading/manipulation bits behind an ineligant pasted-on theme with additional manipulation elements. The result becomes a nearly solitary exercise in resource manipulation for an extended period of time. There are many game in different genres that I'd rather spend the time playing and enjoy more. Perhaps due to our inexperience we're not opening up to lots of table talk and deal-making and that's the problem. That would at least make the game more interactive, but wouldn't change the overall gaming element of maximum resource manipulation. People say there are lots of choices. Really? It seems fairly scripted since the best thing to do is maximize those resources with each action... and the choices really are just different avenues of how you manipulate those resources. Ehhh. It's not a bad game, but it's not a very fun one either.

Played this game 1x. It was a 4 Player game, all experienced boardgamers. At first overwhelming...even for these guys. But they were hooked after the first 2 rounds. With rules explanation it took us about 2 hours. 

There is so much going on, it will take 3/4 plays for making the right choices at the right moment.

The day after the game, 2 guys of my gaming group emailed that they were excited about this game and were planning to buy it. That doesn't happen often...

I'll rate it an 8 at this point, the game needs more playing for my final rating. But we know for sure already that this is a fantastic game.

One player stated that for him this game was a mix between Puerto Rico and Goa with great Player interaction.

I've seen comparisons between Keythedral and Caylus on BGG, but besides collecting goods there is - in my opinion - no link between these games.

I'll come back after more games of Caylus...

I'm back...played my second game of Caylus with the same group as mentioned above. Totally different from the first game, but the same player won.

The first game was more a castle race, now it was a building game. The player who ended as 2nd didn't build at all in the castle. He made one mistake the last turn in not being able to use a architect. He could have build the 25 points cathedral, and that would have been a victory for him.

The winner was about 15 points (!) ahead of us. Number 2-3-4 were very close.

I've to mention that the winner is really a great gamer, he does win most of our games.

The game has lots of 'layers', there is much to discover. It will take quit some games before this game reveals it's secrets...

The winner mentioned that he didn't follow a certain strategy but that he tried to react on how we played.

Great game, but my rating won't change until I know the game better.

Played it again, the first time another player won! I still don't do well in this game, maybe it's bigger than me :). But I'll come back! I find it hard to develop a strategy in this game. The options are so many and what are the right ones? Well that's the question some players know in my group. I still don't know the answer...yet!

Can't decide if 2- or 3-player is best, but the rating drops past that. It's just so...nasty. I think meddling should cost a little more, maybe 2-3-4, so coalitions pay more collectively (it also has a nice thematic touch, in that getting the corruptible official on his feet and moving would be harder than keeping him moving once he's up).  Anyway, fine game, reminiscent of Puerto Rico in its emergent randomness.

I played this game, and although we had some rules wrong at the beginning, we switched to the way we were supposed to play half way through.  This is a solid design, but I have no urge to play it again.  I've played plenty of games wrong the first time through, Puerto Rico, Age of Steam, Die Macher, etc.  In each of these games, I was able to see past the mistakes and see a wonderful game.  Here, I can see past the mistakes and see a game that just doesn't grab me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Forget about luck, only skill matters here. As a die hard fan of chess I immediately fell in love with this game. A truly outstanding design.

This is one of the few euro games I know of that evolves differently every time I play it - everything depends on the players and their strategy. The core mechanics are super simple, but the choices you make are not, mainly due to the fact there are no individual player boards and actions taken by one player on the main board directly affect everyone else. For a euro game, the level of player interaction is just huge.

After 2 plays, I don't see what the buzz is about - There's not really anything new or compelling here, and it takes too long for what it is. Two and a half hours with 5 fast players who all had played at least once before, and the potential for analysis paralysis could make this game interminable

A good game, but not quite my cup of tea.  I will definitely play it again sometime, and we'll see if I like it more.  Too hard for less than "hard-core" game players.  Also, I see a definite disparity arising between those who've played it a few times and those who haven't (maybe not quite as bad as Puerto Rico).  I played it again with 3 today - I liked it a lot more with three people.

I'm liking it more after further plays.  Also, I've reversed the scoring of this and Caylus Magna Carta.  I think the original is better without being that much longer or harder.

Somewhat slow and boring.
Update 1: I started to understand that I dislike how only one person can get into money->vp places.
Update 2: Started to like this game a bit, it's still dry but somewhy feels better. Increased rating 4->5.
Update 3: Started to like even more after playing Le Havre few times. Le Havre is even more crappy, just pure resource conversion engine - not even a worker placement (moving the same worker to another of ~20 locations each turn don't think deserves to be called worker placement - it's just "single worker moving"). Caylus at least gives direct competition - over places near the end of the road via manipulating provost, and a bit tricky fight over bonus for building the castle. Increased rating 5->6.

Provisional rating after four plays, three of them two-player.  I can see where this could get truly vicious (with the provost,) in a multiplayer game.  (As it is, I really ticked off my wife in the second game we played.)  But then again, retribution can stave off the provost, as I discovered recently.

The two player game seems to have fallen into a pattern of (a)get a lot of resources, build a little - like in the castle, (b) get a few resources, make multiple builds.  Then, back to (a.)  Not that this is bad...  The three player game had less of this pattern, if only because it was harder to claim resources.

This is obviously a gamer's game. It has no real world equivalence, except the fact that you produce, build and screw people. I like the play, it works very well and seems balanced, almost too balanced as the game almost makes you score points and the diminishing returns for doing more in one turn keeps the leaders from running away too much. All in all a nice fun game. little long with 5 players... I will always play if someone asks, but I dont think I'm going to ask for it myself, so maybe this is closer to a 6. Oh yeah, the theme is tacked on. I could make this game with plenty of other themes, but I see no problem with the one thats there...

In this fine game players work to collect resources needed to build a castle for the king and gain prestige for themselves.  This game is heavy and strategic, with many different paths to victory.

Caylus is a game where players have many things they want to do, and just not enough money / actions to get them all done.  It is a game of timing, where choosing to help build things 'first' can make a big difference in the end.  It is also a game of deciding when to help or hinder your opponents.  All in all, Caylus is a very fun, fast-moving game of resource management and building.  Highly recommended.

My favourite board game at the moment. I absolutely love the fact it has no luck, though I do feel that point assignments appear to be arbitrary, such as the cathedral as well as denier income choices from starting. 

Strategy is deep without seeming to be overly frustrating or feels like you're doing "work" such as number crunching.

Having only 1 game ftf but numerous 2 player games at BSW. It's taken a while to gain an appreciation for this game. While initially I was luke-warm due to the rather large amount of options open to you. Once buildings and combinations of building become clearer, it makes for a much much more enjoyable game. 
UPDATE: whilst this is a great game, it always took way too long for my liking. I actually enjoyed it most playing 2 player or on BSW. With the production of Caylus Magna Carta, I'm unsure if this game will be played much at all, and I'm verging on trading it.

Caylus helped establish the worker placement genre, which I happen not to find particularly intriguing - but I'm clearly in the minority on this one. It's a solid heavy-weight example of the category, though. 

It also contains overused concepts that, for me, have turned into immediate turn-offs: buildings that do stuff, resources, and so forth.  

Age of Empires III and Dungeon Lords (recognizing their own problems) are the only two worker placement games that I need to own, although I don't rate either above a 6.5.

I did not enjoy this game the first time I played it, but re-learned it with the [i]actual[/i] rules a couple years later and loved it.


This falls toward the higher end on the complexity scale, so it's definitely not one to play if you're tired or you have non-gamers present.

Need to get this one back to the table soon.

At this very moment, I'm kind of sick of this great game. I played it so much. That's why I lowered the rate. Used to be my favorite. This game has everything you need if you are looking for a game with ZERO luck factor. No hiden information, everything you must know about your opponent is in the open. I heard there are a lot of paths to victory but I don't dare too much: building and VP tracks are sure bets. You should never run short of money. As a 2 players game is excellent, 3 players is my favourite, 4 players is very struggling and 5 players is too long.

My rating for this has varied from 6 to 8 and I've almost traded it away a couple of times.  I like the brain-burning aspect of it, but I don't like it with two players because it becomes too chess-like.  I don't want to think 10 plies deep in any game--that's not what I find enjoyable.  With 5 players it's too long.  It may be too long with 4.  So that leaves it as a good brain-burning three-player game.  As long as I remember to play it only with 3 (or maybe once in a while with 4) then I think it's a good game.

Quizá el más duro de los juegos de colocación de trabajadores. En él, seremos los maestros constructores de un castillo en Francia. Para ello mandaremos a nuestros peones a diferentes edificios en los cuales obtendremos piedra, madera, tela u otros elementos que nos irán ayudando en la construcción del castillo y de la ciudad que va creciendo alrededor del mismo.

One game with 3 players, another with 4 players.

Like: Caylus does many things very well with the worker placement mechanism that I wish more worker placement games would emulate. The provost is simply a brilliant game element which transforms the board into more than just a menu of actions that players choose from. The penalty of not having your workers activate if they are ahead of the provost on the road is harsh enough to focus a lot of the play and interaction around the provost, which raises the complexity of player interaction in the game far above the basic blocking interaction that many worker placement games settle for. Some of the players can collude to ensure that another player's worker on a space does not activate (by moving the provost back far enough along the road); this is highly significant because typically the most valuable spaces are concentrated toward the end of the road on any given turn. 

Caylus doesn't settle for using the provost and blocking for player interaction though. You can collect a lot of points and resources by constructing the right buildings for your opponents to use. The race for the king's favors in exchange for adding sections to the castle is intense and requires careful timing based on your opponents' moves and resources available. Lastly, I really like that as players stop placing workers, it gets more and more expensive for the remaining players to place further workers. This both rewards efficient use of your workers (so that you can pass earlier) and prevents any one player from getting too far ahead of the other players by placing many more workers. As an aside, I also admire the simplicity with which Caylus controls each player's worker supply. Instead of forcing players to take actions to get more workers, Caylus gives you all of your workers from the beginning and controls the number of workers you place by the number of useful action spaces available, how many players have passed in the round, and how much money you have available. I much prefer these soft methods of control as they lead to more strategic depth.

A few other elements I enjoy: The board's appearance is very clean. I like the choice of color scheme and the brightness of the tiles. I'm a big fan of the ability to build over the starting buildings with the green income buildings, which reduces the number of action spaces available (thus increasing the tension) and forces players to use the more advanced buildings (which other players have built) for resources. The game plays quickly, especially if players move the provost ahead of the bailiff frequently. The game is also very easy to set up and tear down, especially compared to something like Agricola. 

Dislike: Behind the awesomeness of the provost and the other fun player interactions lies a dry, themeless resource conversion game. None of the buildings have names or distinctive art, and the effects of the buildings are limited to awarding resource cubes, money, allowing you to build other buildings, or allowing you to convert resources into money, money into resources, resources into points, etc. The resources themselves are also nondescript. There are brown cubes, gray cubes, blue cubes, pink cubes, and yellow cubes; aside from the brown cubes corresponding to wooden buildings and the gray cubes corresponding to stone buildings, there is not much thematic reason for why certain game aspects require certain cubes. It's hard to feel like you are doing anything more in the game than trying to maximize your points relative to the other players. The victory point and money favor tracks also feel very lazily designed and uninteresting.

Overall: A fantastic game that is a must-play if you enjoy worker placement games. This is a much more competitive game than many euro games, which earns it big points with me. My rating would be higher if the system behind the provost and player interactions was not so dry and themeless. This is the main reason I don't own this game; I already have so many other games which are just as well designed but pack in much more fun and excitement.

Love this game. It has a lot more cutthroat play than Puerto Rico.

Loses half a point for some of that Eurogame dryness.

Although it seemed very confusing from the rules, Caylus actually plays very well.

But other than that I found it to be very fun, if very unforgiving.

Had a bad start with this one, sitting down to play with four others and none of us had played it before and tried to play out of the rule book. This made it seem a lot more complicated, long winded and dryer than it actually is.

grandpa of worker placement games... actions can be cut off from use, actions happen in a linear order, help construct the castle for bonuses and big points, games are different depending on buildings that get built and player choices/moods... challenging, interesting, so many variables, fun, "thinky"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I can see why this game is so well received, and while I've enjoyed the games so far, I'm not completely sold on the game. I love the build-as-you-go path of actions, and there are a lot of options available to the players. The value of the actions also seems to vary quite a bit depending on how far into the game you are.

The biggest downside is that the turns get excessively long the further into the game you are -- more tiles and options open up, dragging the game to a slow grind as more and more calculations are required. The brisk pace at the beginning is soon replaced by a plodding finale.

Also, the game can get especially nasty, as players get targeted and hurt by actions meant to target the leader. The bridge/vizier movement (any actions after that counter are not taken) can be especially vicious... If someone wants to target the leader and the current last place person happens to be in the way, that last place person suffers even more. In fact, someone who feels "out" of the game early can heavily influence the game simply by jockeying that token around and threatening to play the kingmaker -- an element so easily abusable that it must certainly be intentional, which seems odd.

The game features many excellent strategic options and sports some very interesting and game elements. With more play, and better skills to evaluate the worth of buildings and actions, I could see this becoming an 8 or so... Still, Puerto Rico and Aladdin's Dragons provide some of the same experience, but in half the time or less.

Somehow this went from "a game I should try sometime" to "a game I must have" after a random recommendation got me looking into it more... and I'm really glad I picked it up.  I don't think I've suffered that much brain burn from a first play since my first game of Agricola... so Caylus is in great company in my book :laugh:.  The second game was probably even more of a burn... but I felt more in control too... and even won against one experienced and two inexperienced players.  

I want another couple of plays to comment further... but on top of everything I love about the worker placement mechanic I found the potential of the shifting board, minor bouts of aggressive play with the Provost and game timing, and trying to keep your original plan intact throughout the turn even when you got all the placements you want extremely enjoyable.  A worthy classic I'm hoping to explore more!

Had I played this 3 years ago I imagine I would have been impressed by Caylus just as most people had, but now with the numerous action selection games available I only found it to be excellent.  The many interlocking parts between the worker placement, the resource management, the castle building and the favor track do present the players with an interesting canvas to work with.  There weren't any one specific route to victory but I believe being the first to choose for the better part of the game really gave me the edge over my opponents (even after committing a couple of early and newbie mistakes), something they failed to acknowledge the importance of.

My only problem with Caylus after just one play is how processional each round seemed to be.  This will of course be tested further but I can see how certain buildings will always be preferred over others, and thus will be built (as well as claimed) first.

This is a very good game indeed. Very tense from the middle, you need good tactics to win, you need to keep track of the other's moves, and you need to change your strategy quickly. I like it a lot. Most quoted: "Damn, I was going to use that building!". There is a ton of interaction in this game, which I liked a lot after games like puerto rico and Catan, and even carcassone. You can really ruin the others strategy by occupying a building which they need. There are a lot of good strategy to follow, because there are a lot of way to score points. This is a really good game, definitely in my favourites.

My Caylus rating has dropped slowly but steadily over time.  I love all the board options, but the building placement rules are screwy and hard to remember.

RATING: 9.5
Brilliant.  Its appearances do not confess its clever intricacies and balance.  Caylus does bear some very vague similarities to [thing=9216]Goa[/thing], in that you need X to get Y, but you need Z in order to get X, and to get Z at a reasonable price, you need Y; so you just have to decide which bullet to bite, and how you want to go at it.  Good stuff!

Rating after first play. Oh just what possibilities! This may become a love relationship, time will tell. I like that there are many ways to get victory points so you can choose different tactics to win. That reminds me of Puerto Rico. Oh I just have to play more..

Played once. This is almost a brain burner. For me, time matters so I can not give it an 8 (yes I'll turn it down if I don't have time for it). Quite good, having some original mechanics.

Great game.  No luck or random chance involved.  If you like Agricola, you'll also like this game.  A lot of the strategy focuses around resource management and screwing your opponent(s). It's great.  Almost as great as Puerto Rico.  I'd rank this game #2 right behind Puerto Rico (chess excluded).

Just one game at a friend's house with this one, and after my cold first impressions with Puerto Rico I must say that this game really blew me away. It was also my first attempt at a worker-placement game.

Our first game with four players (three totally new to the game, two couples with two non-gamer girls) lasted slightly more than three hours (rules included) and no one noticed how much time we were involved in the game.

Make no mistake, this is a brain burner. I got myself an headache once the game was over (but ultimately I was able to pull off a one-point win!), but it was a deep and satisfying experience.

Now I really want to play it again, and I really want to try and make my friends (who hate euros) get in touch with this kind of games.

A 2. kedvenc játékom. :cool: Nagyon jól súlyozott játék, sok taktikával lehet győzni. Minél többen játszottuk, annál izgalmasabb volt (amúgy nem rossz ketten sem játszani). Van egy kis interakció a játékosok között, ami növeli a játékélményt. A könnyebb döntések, melyeket a játék elején kell hozni, a party vége felé egyre nehezebbekké válnak. Végig kemény küzdelem a győzelemért, fokozódó feszültség minden játékosban. Ez az amire számíthatsz! Ha szereted az összetet stratégiát ez a te játékod! :laugh:

I have not find yet any game deeper in strategy. The only problem I see in playing it is that it completely exhaust my brain. I am done playing after a game of it and if I play at night, frequently dream about it ;)
also excellent as a 2p game

Wow the game is complex.  Worker placement is a neat mechanic that was new to me when the game came out.  The game has some nice mechanic that involve resource management and building, things I like.

RATING: 9
After 5+ Plays: A very different game with 2 rather than 5, but great fun either way.  Many different viable strategies.

After 10+ Plays: This was one of my first euros, and it remains one of my favorites.  My favorite aspect of Caylus is the type and level of interaction.  I have a strong preference for indirect interaction in multiplayer games e.g. denying you what you want by taking it first, rather than attacking you directly.  Caylus has this in spades, but also interestingly integrates some more direct screwage in the provost mechanic.  I like the provost far  more than most direct interaction though because you have a choice how open to attack to leave yourself by the riskiness of your placements, the money you keep in reserve, and how early you pass for the round.

RATING: 6.5
Caylus is a solid game in terms of mechanics, but it falls into an awkward spot in my collection where I have other games I prefer that do the same thing.

It's worker placement where each turn likely brings new action spaces into play - I'd probably play Agricola first.

You go around acquiring cubes that are used to complete tasks (building the castle/new buildings) for points - I'd probably play Lords of Waterdeep first.

The combination of those two game devices puts it in its own little worker placement niche, and it's sometimes nice to pull it out. But it's not the primary option in my collection.

This is a great game. Serious resource management with lots of timing details. I like all of the turn and event order mechanisms. The randomization of the first production and manufacturing buildings as well as the choices buildings the individual players build make every game subtlety to wildly different. My one complaint is that it is a bit long. Now that I have played Caylus Magna Carta, I would choose that one over this.

I know that my rating of 6 may be considered heresy by some, but the game is long!  Just too much downtime.  In my humble opinion, the only reason this is being rated so highly is because people are hungry for new game mechanics.  Their call ...

A must for serious boardgame players .

If your willing to take the effort to learn the rules you will be rewarded with one of the greatest strategic games ever.

I must warn you :
It's a lot heavier than puerto rico so maybe you want to
play puerto rico first.If puerto rico is too heavy for you don’t bother with caylus.

If you like heavy strategic games with no luck involved:
Go get it. run!

号称无随机性德式策略游戏的典范，其实还是有随机性的，起始的中立建筑就是。凯吕斯城对人数的要求极高，人数2人，3人，4-5人时策略路线和玩法都有些不同。势均力敌的2-3个人体验的话，游戏就相当于一个零和游戏了，损人则利己；但如果体验人数到4-5人时，游戏就有点外交合纵连横的味道了，总之没体验过的一定要找机会试试。。。

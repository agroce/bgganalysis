Really like the rules, except for one thing.  It is possible for you to never get a turn since you have to roll for each unit to do anything and once you fail you are done with your turn.  We sometimes play with a house rule rule where if you fail your first roll, you can still do a move before you are done.

2015-12-23 : Played Phil's hexified version of the rules. There is some quirky stuff going on, but for a quick skirmish game there's lots to love here and in our first play we saw bad tactical play getting severely punished - as it should. The fact that it is a real positioning/manoeuvre game with very bloody combat rules makes you need to think hard about what you want to do and not make many mistakes.

A nice game to play, easy to pick up and remember the core components. A lot of the decisions comes down to what order you want to activate and where you leave your wild charge units.

One of the best rule sets to ever come along.

Fairly straightforward tactical game which emphasizes narrative over historical nonsense and general clumsiness. Recommended.

I have been a miniature's gamer since the mid 70s and have seen a few rulesets. "Rampant" is a nice, neat, well presented generic system that works well with a wide varity of troops and armies. Not for "cut-throat gamers" at all, but IMO screw those gamers because I don't want them anywhere near my gaming table anyway!

Very streamlined, simple rules, can play in less than 2 hours but delivers great fun and even not inconsiderable nuance.

Superb set f rules that make for fast fun battles with each unit showing a cheeky bit of personality. It's also very open to customisation.

RATING: 8
A fun game, very much of the 'cinematic' style, but very easy to pick up, and gives a tense, exciting game.

Simply put, a fantastic set of mid-sized miniature war game rules for medieval battles. Dan Mersey did a great job building an interesting game with simple, streamlined game mechanisms based on the familiar D6, capturing the nuances of different troop types in a clean and sensible manner, accounting for morale (which all good war game rules need in my opinion), and adding some chrome where appropriate (Leaders can duel, there are a small number of special troop abilities, etc.). The army lists are great, and the book is chock-full of scenarios which is terrific. And to top it all off, Osprey does their usual superb job of mixing great artwork and photos together with a clean layout, which makes this a really nice book to read through. A+

Easy to learn medieval based skirmish game. Can be played by beginners or experienced gamers. Easy to adapt. Worth exploring the various unit upgrades and playing the dozen scenarios.

A very good game!

Despite its simplicity, or maybe because of it, Lion Rampant is a fast playing fun game. 

We have played a few games now using dark ages figures, and enjoy it so much we have invested in 28mm wars of the roses as well!

Highly recommended!

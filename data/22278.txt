I really like this game for a few reasons. 1) Simplicity of the turn with deeper strategic options. There are only 4 possible actions but many choices that you can make with those actions. 2) The strategical options. There's an element of a psychological battle that can come with deceptive moves or hoarding cards, etc. There's also tricky offensive and defensive maneuvers you can do by doing an additional action. On top of this the varient to place the neutral guards adds an additional dynamic to the game. 3) The level of player interaction is up to you. You can be very mean or play nice and still win. 4) You never or rarely ever feel helpless, like you have no control and can't do anything useful on your turn.

functional and complete game with teachable rules and a manageable play time.  i find the degree to which the luck of the draw and the actions of others impacts your decisions a detraction, though, and even absent of that i think it's unlikely that i could end up describing the game as fun.  if i play again i'll get in early if the getting's good, but start skipping turns as soon and as often as possible to build up a warchest.  clogged colors lock up the board, but once unclogged the board will open for those that have the cards.  the restrictions created by the presence kinda reminds me of quo vadis.  i haven't played that in a long time, but this makes me want to revisit it.  surprised by the sdj nomination.

RATING: 6.5
If you enjoy player interaction in the form of manipulating the board situation (vs direct personal interaction) then this game may be for you.  As each player moves guards, places guards or moves their thieves they directly interfer and influence what the next players can or should do.  This gives the game a bit of a screwage factor that may not settle well with some players.  There is a luck of the card draw element, but the wild cards are a controllable element to help counter the luck.  Overall the game is a fairly abstracted area control game with the areas being the palaces and control granting the 'owner' access to the treasure chests and thus the victory points.

Initial rating based upon one 3 player game.  Beautiful bits.  Would like to try this with 2 players to have a little more control in the game.  Fairly dry.

A surprising game actually.  It sorta reminds me of Ticket To Ride but in a smaller, more streamlined package.

Sub out trains across the frontier USA for Ali Babba jumpin in and out of wealthy palaces.

But you got a lot of potential for blocking moves combined with set collection.  

Despite being a little dry, once you get a game or two under your belt I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how dynamic and enjoyable this one can be.

A mostly harmless card optimization game. I'm always a bit leery about racing games where the 1st to cross the line wins as it's difficult to tell how balanced the game is. Plays well and easy to teach but not much longevity to it (nothing to really differentiate between plays).

Very light family game. As the game almost plays itself I wouldn't recommend it for any other setting than with children or inexperienced gamers. For hardcore players there is nothing to see here. Start player has an unfair advantage and there is nothing in the rules to really mittigate this. Basic mechanics of the game work well but are just not enough for me to center a whole game around.

What a good lunch game!  Very simple rules with some interesting twists. Pulling thieves along with your own guard moves can really generate some quick board position changes and throw off your opponent's game.  This game requires a good balance between defensive and offensive actions... if you spend your whole game on offense, just a little defense by your opponent can REALLY slow you down.  So you need to spend a little time on defense to slow them down, etc... It's a thief ballet!

Un juego sencillo en mecánicas, pero que tiene su aquél. Gana el primero en conseguir seis tesoros. Cada jugador maneja una serie de ladrones y unos vigilantes. Tienes que intentar conseguir el objetivo y ponerselo dificil al contrincante. A dos probablemente queda un poco cojo. Sí que da un poco la sensación de que no hay mucha planificación posible, pero tiene mas miga de lo que parece a simple vista.
Los movimientos de las fichas se realizan con cartas y el tesoro lo capturas cuando consigues reunir ladrones suficientes en el palacio donde se encuentra el tesoro. Es facil de explicar y de jugar.. aunque ganar es otra historia. depende de quien juegue. Es apto para no jugones.

First impression after first play. Might go up to 6 but we'll see.

Seems to be a decent family game with a small portion of tactics in it. Building sets in one's hand is luck driven but obviously those cards can be played many ways and some are definitely better for you that others.

There could also be a slight problem with down time since multiple actions during players turn are possible and they is some thinking involved.

3 plays in. Player going last has won every time. Hopefully this is balanced, as it's an interesting design. I'm starting to worry that the additional cards as compensation for going later in turn order are too powerful.

There's some opportunity for clever play (mainly building up a hand of cards and then making the most of your three thief moves for a turn) but in general it just feels like playing the hand you're dealt.  Luck of the draw plays a strong part (it's easier to score if you draw strings of like-colored cards) plus you have the element of "he who gets picked on the least wins".  Play some cards; move some pawns around...I just don't get much enjoyment out of it.

A brilliant game for three. You need to play it a couple of times to "get" all the things you can do with what initially seem like very constrained placement rules. Ends up being much more of a brain-burner than expected. The production values are up to Queen's typically wonderful standards, although the rules translation is a bit ropey. Some have said that it is very abstract, but the theme works really well when explaining the game. Recommended if you like Aton by the same designer. 

Your choices are more limited and therefore easier with four. 

Horrible with two.

Production: Beautiful board, colorful cards, and sturdy, well-shaped pawns.  Play: More strategic than I thought it would be.  The cards one draws is random, and therefore one is prey to luck, but there are many different clever ways to use cards, especially with moving one's own guards and bringing thieves along, so the thoughtful player is rewarded.  This is very much a game about using one's cards efficiently, and making creative plays to take advantage of momentary opportunities. (3+1+3) (1 play)

Each player leads a group of thieves and tries to gain the best booty for themselves, but the treasure is well-guarded in the palaces of Baghdad, so you must slip your thieves into the guard corps and attempt to bribe those you can't represent with one of your own. The player who plays their cards best and reacts most cleverly to the different situations will succeed in getting their thieves and guards well distributed in Baghdad, and therefore be the first to collect four pieces of treasure.

RATING: 6
Rating based upon 3 games - one 2 player (slightly wrong rules) and one 4, and one 5 player. 
The rulebook whilst trying to be user friendly is something I would re-organise and make three things expressly clear earlier on:
1 - the number of chests needed to win (put it in the object of the game section)
2- that you can only do 3 "thief" actions per turn
3 - that to move a thief into a place from your stock required there to be one of your own guards AND at least one neutral guard (black or any other player) at the palace. 

Like many multiplayer games that say they play 2, I found the 2 player game relatively flat.  Some of the subtleties discovered in the second game (4 player) might enliven it, but I'm still very tempted to say I'd spend my time on a dedicated 2 player game. The 4 player game revealed lots of subtlety in how to do things the more we played.   There was concern from one player that the the analysis paralyisis group could destory the pleasure in playing this game. First four player game came in at well over an hour rather than 45 mins on the box, but we learned much as we went. 5 player game went on a little too long and seemed too chaotic.

Sweet! Very simple card play gets your guards in the right spot. Plays best with 4, if you try to block one player, you make it easier on another. Classic German game play, fast, easy to read the situation, easy choices, satisfying game. *** Discovered we missed a rule - you cannot do more than three THIEF actions in a turn. You do as much as you like, moving yours or nuetral guards around. But bringing a thief in or carrying a thief over is limited to three actions. So if you have only one guard to bring, you cannot spend 4 cards, bring 4 thieves in and steal the first chest in one turn.

Rather abstract, but fun nevertheless. It's quite a puzzle to work out the best possible move each and every turn, given your cards in hand and the new situation on the different palaces.

In our first (2 player) game, the neutral guards weren't moved at all, but still it turned out to be a good session. I'm interested in giving it another try with more players.

Juego abstracto muy interesante y agradable de jugar, con unas mecánicas originales para mí y que se juega en media hora larga cuando se sabe jugar y que esconde muchas más sutilezas de las que puedes advertir en una primera partida. Bien jugado permite administrar muy bien tu mano de cartas para hacer movimientos muy inteligentes.
Las ilustraciones, de Michael Menzel, son de altísimo nivel, lo que ayuda a vestir este abstracto en juego tipo euro. Además, siendo un juego antiguo, está tirado de precio en los mercadillos de segunda mano. Yo lo conseguí por unos míseros 5 euros.

It's a shame the new edition has gone for cardboard rather than wooden components and the box is far too big for the contents so I think it's overpriced for what you get.  It is nice quality, however, with thick cardboard. Easy game to pick up  with some light brain burning potential as you plan several moves in a turn to your best advantage.   Low complexity.

RATING: 7
Card play is clearly reminiscent of Ticket to Ride. It is interesting to try to figure out the best way to use your cards. But no matter how you puzzle it out, you are bound to draw cards that are of no use to you. This makes me believe that the luck factor is much more important here than in TTR.

Elég egyszerű handmanagement, area inflence játék. Gyors, de azért lehet benne kombinálgatni, miközben van benne egy nagy adag szerencse is valószínűleg. Abba a kategóriába tartozik, aminél nem teljesen tudom, hogy kinek szól. A szerencse szerep, a rövid játékidő miatt családi kategóriába sorolnám, de olyan fokon kitolós, hogy nehezen tudom elképzelni, hogy családok jó érzéssel játszanák.

RATING: 4
Fairly dull and abstract tactical puzzle. In a way, it's sort of similar to Ticket to Ride without the route building and with blind card draws only. Considering that the route building and blocking is what makes TtR interesting it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that the Thief of Baghdad isn't.

RATING: 7
The Thief of Baghdad is a strong card driven game of tactical play with plenty of interaction, and possibility for clever moves.  The little puzzles that develop between turns are a fun challenge to solve as far as getting the most productivity out of your go.  The "take that" factor can be high, as moving guards into and away from palaces can squeeze opponents' ability to take efficient turns.  Although the game is controlled by the draw of cards, the luck is not overwhelming.  The addition of the Dancing girl cards makes forfeiting a turn's actions viable in order to make a stronger move next time around. All in all a great small game, that should play quickly once players understand the movement of pieces.  It could bog down with APers.   

UPDATE:  Playing this after a long hiatus I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised.  Maybe the rash of worker placement games made this feel fresher  than my memory, but I really enjoyed the gameplay.  Clever game, with wonderful components.  the rating slides up to an 8, and may actually climb if I continue to feel so positive.

This SdJ nominee is all about good card management.  Sure, it's abstract in theme, but the artwork sure is nice to look at.  Typical Queen box doesn't fully close even though the box is too big.  I think this game may take a play or two to get the hang of it, and currently I think it's a pretty good game.  I predict this one will get dissed in comparison to the other nominees, which could be a shame.  I'll see how I feel with further playings.

Nice abstract, with a fun and totally non-realistic pasted-on theme (to enter and steal in a palace you have to have a non-friendly  guard at the door...).

Not as easy and relaxing as the graphics, theme and components could make you think it is... 

The cards-luck factor still prevents it to be a pure brainburner where everything is under control.

RATING: 7
The four simple actions actually provide players with a considerable amount of latitude in using their cards.  Indeed, players can quite creative in moving the guards and thieves from palace-to-palace.  Sometimes it seems as though it will be impossible to assemble the required number of thieves in a palace in order to steal a treasure chest.  However, it is often possible to achieve objectives with a clever combination of cards and actions.  Pulling-off such maneuvers is quite satisfying, and gives me a feeling of accomplishment.  When I’ve won, I’ve felt I’ve achieved the victory with clever play.  That is a good feeling.  I never knew it could be so much fun to be a thief!

Watch out for 2 rules though.

and 
2. You can move from one palace to any other palace with the right card play.

After 1 play.

From perspective of experienced player this game is pure exercise in optimization.  If everybody optimizies equally good, the winner is decided randomly (because he drew better cards or took advantage of profitable situation created right before his move).
This is characteristics of games which are too tactical.  In this game, during your turn, you play your few cards as good as you can and wait until turn goes back to you.  When it happens, situation on board is changed completley, so again, you use your cards in a very tactical way.  There is no planning.  Bad.

[Warning: remarks above apply to 4-people play.  It might be a bit better with 3 and much better with 2.]

But from the point of view of a casual/family gamer this is a nice game, not too simple, not too complicated, pretty and overally enjoyable.
  Don't have to add, I'm not a casual/family gamer...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not a bad filler in the vein of TtR and a little shorter but still a tad too long for this light type of game and too light to be anything else. 

Just another set collection game that feels quite a bit like TtR, pull some cards, pull some more cards, make a little play, repeat. Almost purely tactical as play is completely dictated by your cards and also what others have done so any kind of planning other than trying to collect cards and maybe one turn ahead really isn't possible. 

All that said it isn't a bad little filler even if just a tad long for what it offers, after collecting some cards you can put together a few neat moves but getting the cards you want relies heavily on luck. 

Almost enough to hold your interest but not quite, might make an okay filler for very occasional play at best.

Good fun trying to get your thieves into the palaces to steal the treasures while having to bribe the minimum of guards (the guards in Bagdad are all corrupt if this game is to be believed....)

Hand management is all. I've only played it once, but won by only playing cards when I was a position to steal a treasure - part-completed thefts leave you open to blocking tactics. This aspect reminded me of ticket to ride.

Down side for which I've knocked my rating down by a point: as the game progressed it slowed down a lot (one guy spent 10 minutes contemplating a single turn before passing and just drawing cards) as the dreaded analysis paralysis took hold. Your best moves are not always immediately apparent, and if you make too many sub-optimal moves you'll lose against optimal play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played multiple times now and my enjoyment of the game gets better and better.  The only reason that I haven't rated this game higher us because, even though there are only 6 colours, there are times in the game where the randomness of the card deck seems to determine your fate.

Skillful use of the neutral guards as blockers appears to be the key... and the fact that you can always move a thief with your own colour guard means you can sometimes get a treasure quite cheap.

The limit of three thief moves per turn is definitely required, otherwise the 'card hoarder' (i.e.-someone who passes for two or three turns in a row) could gain a huge advantage.

One of the better games to come from Queen in a while.

I played the original version and I suspect that is the one to get, even if it costs a bit more. There are a lot of pieces to manipulate throughout the game and I don't understand how the cardboard tiles in the new edition are a sufficient replacement for the wooden bits... Anyway, we enjoyed our play of the older version. Players are trying to get a target number of thieves into a palace to steal chests of gold. The board consists of six palaces, each with a stack of 4 chests with increasing numbers of thieves needed to steal them (4, 5, 6, and 7). Depending on the number of players, the first player to steal the target number of chests instantly wins the game. 

Four guards can be placed at the entrance to each palace. Every palace starts with a neutral guard and then players add their own guards depending on the number of players. During the game you are playing cards to add thieves or move thieves with your guards into palaces to claim a chest before other players. Neutral and enemy guards increase the cost of adding thieves (by 1 card each), so players can also use guards to slow other players down. You need a neutral guard and one of your own guards at minimum to add from the supply, so your cost is always at least 1 card. We discovered that there are some crafty plays to be made between guards and thieves to block and add and it feels a bit like a logic puzzle on each turn - with the uncertainty of your future card draws forcing you to commit before you really know if a location will pan out. I don't know if this game will stick around in my collection for long, but I was pleasantly surprised as I had heard so many negative things for so long about this Spiel nominee. Being a nominee probably builds an expectation that this simple game can't possibly meet.

Excellent game! Easy to learn (although the English rules were poorly translated in some spots, its easy to figure out what was meant) and lots of fun to play. Played it first with just 2 of us, then a second game with 3 of us. A 3 player game is signifcantly more challenging (but also more fun).

Too much downtime with 4 players (especially as you can't do much planning inbetween turns).
We initially misread one rule (didn't realise you had to have one of your own guards plus an external guard in a palace before you could move thieves in) and quite liked it, but playing the proper way seems to make it a lot more drawn out.

RATING: 6
Essentially an overproduced abstract game with the epitome of pasted-on theme.  The theme is so lightly applied that it is almost distracting from the purpose of the game.  But anyway, the rules are so simple, yet the underlying game presents quite a challenge.  Sure, there is a lot of luck in the card draw, but it is obvious that clever hand management and card play go a long way.  I would definitely avoid playing this with an AP-prone player, as multiple actions per turn can lead to overanalysis in the wrong type of player.  I'm curious to see how well this one holds up in the long run.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
An abstract card-collecting game. Players attempt to maximize the use of their cards to steal treasure. Putting aside the fact that the theme was non-existent, the game itself was draggy and lends itself to AP. There just isn't much depth or variety to this game. Very poor game.

A simple race game, with a twisted puzzle of card play. Every turn, you look at your hand, and wonder how best to place your thieves, and usually, you can't just place them where you need them: because it's a race, you can't wait forever, and using your imperfect hand of cards as well as you can requires some lateral thinking, which is really rewarding.

pretty for sure but not strategic enough.  Two important things which aren't clear in the rules.
1. You must have a guard of your own color and either a neutral guard or an opponents guard to be able to place a thief of yours into that palace.  Also it says 'next one' and one might think you must move guards in a clockwise direction if you look at the examples in the rule book.  Terrible translation for sure for causing confusing.  Whoever Queen had translate this game to English needs to be replaced with a translator that can convey game rules in a competent manner.  Having said all this though the gameplay I'm rating it and ignoring the rules.

Not bad. There are interesting tactical puzzles in this game - this is a very tactical game - and sometimes you can have some good fun trying to figure out what to do. Most of the time the game doesn't do much for me, though. Played twice, little interest to have the game hit the table again.

Indifferent.

This is a very simple little euro with some surprising depth which can be a whole bundle of fun.

Players attempt to steal treasures from the six houses of rich merchants by using their thieves and placing or moving guards through clever card play.  

This game has pretty good replayability and has proven to be a hit with new gamers and veterans alike.

This is a pretty good game -- easy rules, and some interesting decisions in an attractively produced package.  However, it's a bit too abstract for my tastes.  I'll play it again, and I expect my rating might go up to about 7 with further plays.

RATING: 6.6
Simple multiplayer abstract race game that is both more highly interactive and more laden with tactical possibilities than might first appear. There are only four possible actions, but there's a lot of room for clever play. Managing your limited supply of thieves as costs rise keeps the game interesting as it pushes toward a close and the ability to raise placement costs for other players usually means that games will remain tightly contested.

The production is quite good. Not only the art of the box is beautiful, the board, the meeples and the cards are also really nice. This contributes to dampen its abstract gameplay.

It doesn't bring any new concept to the table, but it has a bit of everything: interaction, tactic, strategy, luck, etc. And it does everything well. And it is short enough not to overstay its welcome.

Each turn, you have several options for you to decide, but the gameplay is quite fluid.

Great fit for 45 minutes.

RATING: 5
First impression (3 players): It's a simple game with a clever but a bit unintuitive mechanics (why you cannot enter a castle if there is only your own guard??). 

Gameplay is all about using randomly drawn cards efficiently. You can move guards/thiefs and put new thiefs onto board. After there is enough thiefs they steal a treasure (and return to supply). There is some balancing between hording cards, hoping to get a good chance to place many thiefs (max 3 / turn) cheap or simply place thief when possible at reasonable price. 

Treasures get more expensive so too much waiting is costly. If players don't leave any open spots for the next player then it probably comes down to the fact who draws best cards at the right time. Our first game took way more than 45 mins which makes me wonder if this game is worth playing because it doesn't offer too much if played for over an hour. We had slow players so maybe its not that bad usually. Three players was a good amount. I'm not sure if four is better for this game.

Really simple area control / pickup game. You are pushing bits with a very straight forward set of movement rules. The strategy will be limited both by the card draw as well as the positioning of the neutral and opponent pieces. One other thing is that the game mechanics make it a bit prone to cause Analysis Paralysis.

Verdict still out.  Quick with 2 players (about 35 minutes), but seemed to balanced as in "you can't do anything to ensure that you forge ahead," but the luck of the cards can dictate that you can't keep up, particularly late in the game.  But that's not exactly a flaw.  I wonder how it will do with three or four players.

This game was nominated for the..SdJ? What gives? It's mechanically sounds but makes for a dull, flat gaming experience. Players are drawing cards in order to use them to place meeples in 6 enclosures in order to steal treasure. There must be guards to 'allow' you to put meeples in (a thematic disconnect, guess that thieves in this game like the extra challenge) and cards are colour coded to match the enclosures. Toss in other things such as moving of guards to make it more 'expensive' to seed an enclosure or to not allow a player a chance to place meeples and you have this abstract card management/movement game.

There's nothing wrong with it. It's just not...exciting or fun for that matter.

Surprisingly good and more than initially meets the eye here.  While one would think that it would entirely come to luck of the draw, there are some interesting choices in passing to get a bonus card and how you can maneuver your guards around and take thieves with them to get points.  I appreciate the elegant design, but the game can slow down due to A/P on occasion.

UPDATE: After playing again, it's decent, but not great.  I think the main issue is that the game is a bit long for what it is.

RATING: 6.5
Origins '07. Jason Matthews was still not back from dinner so we played this one after Rick taught. It's a nice game: plays quickly, simple rules, some player interaction, and room for clever maneuvering.

The board shows 6 palaces of different colors. Each gets 4 treasure chests numbered 4, 5, 6, and 7, and 1 neutral (black) guard. Players are dealt (5   turn order) cards, then take turns placing their own palace guards (6 - #players); each palace can hold up to 4 guards total. A pile of wild cards is set to the side.

On your turn, you may either do NOTHING: draw 3 cards AND a wild card - OR - play card(s), which allows you to move guards or move/place thieves. Any action involving thieves may only be done 3 times. 
- moving your guard: use a card whose color is either the starting palace or the destination; you may drag one of your thieves along for the ride
- moving a neutral guard: use 2 cards, 1 for each color of starting/ending palace
- place a thief: must have your guard at the palace; costs as many cards of that color as there are guards of other colors

If you end up with as many thieves as the # of the top treasure chest, claim the chest and return thieves to supply.

First player to accumulate (8 - player #) chests wins!

A lighter game that has limited appeal to gamers and seems a bit too complicated for casuals.  It's alright once in a while but there are much better fillers for both sets of gamers, so I think it's replayability is seriously limited.  It's too repetitive to light a spark.  Maybe I'm beginning to need a little more theme to inspire me.  It seems like many of the newer games I've tried lately don't have a soul, or maybe I'm just getting older...

I thought this was a pretty decent game.  Using the guard movement to shift your thieves around from palace to palace is a pretty clever mechanic.  Nothing stellar here though.

tl;dr: an enjoyable puzzle

In this game you're stealing treasure. The way to do this is by cleverly maneuvering your pawns around and timing everything well. It's also a game in which you sometimes are making moves to block the other players from getting the treasure. And that turns it into a game of planning for ways around possible blocking moves.
It's a rather enjoyable puzzle, but the game itself doesn't really stand out in a any way.
So not bad, but very middle of the road.

RATING: 7.3
+ surprisingly interesting game (mechanics)
+ nice theme (although the game is quite abstract)
+ good materials, good artwork (especially the board with the six palaces in bright colors)
- It's easy to overlook one or two important rules and then the game doesn't work well:
   ** thief placing requires at least one own AND one foreign guard at the palace
   ** maximum 3 thief actions per turn
- The game ends too suddenly for my taste. And oftentimes the leading player can't be stopped by the others due to limited interaction. So it is basically a race.


Newer versions called "12 Thieves" suffer from a horrible component downgrade!!! Be aware of that! The responsible publisher(s) should be ashamed!

First play - 3 players - A fun game of hand management and puzzle solving. The theme saves this one for me. Place your guards around the 6 palaces. There is also a neutral guard in front of each as well. Play cards of the matching palace color to bribe the neutral and other player's guards to let them into the palace. Once you have the required number of thieves in one palace they can carry out a chest. The next chest in that palace now requires an additional thief to carry it out(4-7). You can also move the neutral guards (2 cards) and your own (1 card) and when you move you own guard he can take 1 thief with him as well. It all came down to the each of us being able to win at the ssame time. Lucky for me though it was my turn. I look forward to playijng this one with 4 players next.

Thorsten Gimmler; Each player will lead a group of thieves and try to gain the best booty for them. But the treasure is hidden in the palaces of Baghdad and is well guarded. Therefore, the leaders slip their men into the guards corps and try to bribe the rest of the guards. The player who plays his cards the best and reacts the most cleverly to the different situations will be successful in getting his thieves and guards well distributed in Baghdad, and therefore be the first to get four pieces of treasure.

Glad I bought Thief despite reading a fair slog of negative reviews here on the Geek, it's not Carcassonne but I have fun with it - so who am I to complain?
The answer by the way is: no one.

The tactical choices available each turn are always interesting, but they don't build to a greater whole-game interest.  A large part of that is probably the fact that you pretty much have to ignore the game until your turn goes around, since there's basically nothing you can do.  This would be a great candidate for a turn-based web game, since you wouldn't need to see anything between your turns.

Egyszerű kis stratégiai játék, van benne fantázia. Könnyedebb stratégiát kedvelőknek ajánlott.

After 1 Play: With 2 it was solid, if a little dry. I'd like to try it worth more to compare.

Not the best card game around. Can be the victim of paralysis when players only collect cards and wait for the other players to move the guards away...
Might give it another try with kids..

Not my kind of game. Hard to pinpoint the reason, but I just did not like this.

Simple game with just a few flaws in design (why can't I steal from unguarded treasury etc.). But plays pretty smooth.
Had to leave behind in Slovakia.

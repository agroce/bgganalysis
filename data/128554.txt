Each round you play one card and draw a replacement. Could not get simpler than that, can it. 

Völuspá is a game of spotting the opportunities. Events are rather chaotic and you really cannot plan too much ahead. There is some tactics involved since you do not want leave the board too open for the opponent, but still you do not have much control over things. Moreover, there is quite a bit of luck involved with the card draw which further reduces you grip. 

So what makes Völuspá enjoyable then? The answer are the special powers the cards have. They break the rules enough to create various opportunities for scoring, and it is quite fun to figure out ways to use the cards. It is nothing special nor particularly challenging but it is entertaining enough to give a meaning to the game. 

I reckon the game is best with two players when you have more control over things and you can even try to build up the board to favour your hand. The base game could use a few more card types to make the game even more versatile. This can be fixed with the expansions but adding them makes the game longer at the same time. 

From game design perspective, there is one thing that worries me. I see it all too probable that the board will end up into a perfect 7x7 square which locks down the game. This is simply due to the fact that you always want to score two lines instead of one, and thus the board will slowly evolve towards its most natural shape. 

Another issue is the lack of dramatic arc. After a few rounds the center of the board dies and the game continues at the edges. It is like watching a tree grow, it just gets bigger but you only see the changes in the bark.

Surprisingly fun tile laying game.

Similar to Quirkle in mechanism/scoring, but a million times more interesting in terms of game play and variety of icons.

The theme is great and all of the actual different characters provide a varied and appropriate level of interaction.

Obviously the choices towards the end of the game can/will get boggged down to find an "optimal" solution, but it is still a solid pick.

Definitely not my type of game. The theme is very nioe (and it doesn't feel that much pasted on for a game that is basically an abstract), but the main mechanic is just not what I look for in a game when looking for fun. It depends too much on random luck of the draw, and on the chaos other players create while playing their tiles.

I'll probably play it a couple more times, but overall, I simply don't enjoy it.

Qwirkle szerűen pakolgatunk le lapkákat, de itt nem számítanak színek vagy alakok, hanem a lapkák értéke ill. speciális képessége a fontos... Elég ötletes, de azért túl sokat nem játszanék vele... a kategóriához képest túl hosszú, pedig csak az  alap lapkákat próbáltuk...
Egy dologban  a szabály nem egyértelmű: elvileg a 2-es lapkákkal végtelenségig eltarthat a játék, és így vételen pont is szerezhető lenne, de gondolom ezt nem így gondolták a szerzők:)
Egy fontos dolog még: a játék nagyon igényes kivitelű!!

I have Kachina and have played Voluspa with the new expansion tiles added and like the additions. They definitely add to the game play without making it overly complex. My wife loves Kachina, so I'm sure she'll enjoy this game as well. Looking forward to getting a copy.

The tile artwork is improved over the original Kachina. I also like the new scoring markers that were added to this game.

RATING: 7
This tile laying game is fun with trying to plan ahead to maximize scoring, while your opponent is doing the exact same thing leading to changes in the layout (like Wasabi). But there are so many different (fantasy) characters to play, that opportunities open up for new avenues. I liked this as a 2 player game, though I had some AP problems getting to know the various character abilities the first game. Also played with lightning expansion pieces, that didn't seem useful till the end of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Qwirkle with a fantasy theme and tiles with special powers. I feel that game has been overly complicated with special powers and it's just not fun to try to figure out the best move on one's turn. I'm not a big fan of the type of the game Völuspa is and will probably pass a opportunity to play the game live.

Rating based on 4 games at yucata.de.

This is definatly a thinky game and at later stages of the game it can be alittle tedious trying to keep track of everything.

One thing that I initially thought was going to be a problem was remembering what each tile did exactly. Fortunatly about half-way through the game the icons on the cards started to make sense.

The only recommendation I can make with this game is on your first couple of plays, remove the expansion.

*5* (Initial plays)
Great ideas in this game with tile actions when placed. I was very disappointed in the game because of how chaotic it is. I couldn't plan anything without it getting thwarted. The game also has some AP issues, because most players will analyze the entire board and choose whatever gets them the most points, and that can take some time. The tile draw can add too much luck. Great idea, just not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Voluspa struck me as a fairly approachable game. Play a tile, maybe score, draw a tile and next player! But the complexity comes in through the different player tiles. It's not too much to handle. 

However, the game simply wasn't fun. With a small set of tiles to choose from, but a lot of different interactions between those tiles, it's incredibly hard to set yourself up from one turn to the next. So, with every player having to read the board at the start, you get a lot of chin scratching, a lot of AP... ugh.

Maybe increased plays gets players a greater feeling of control over the whole affair, but my wife and I tried it as a two player game a few times, and I liked it a little less with each play.

This game is a short tile placement game. The game length is good, the mechanics simple, and the theme is decent. A good solid game, however nothing really jumped out as being different or special.  

It also has a shocking kingmaker element during the last tile placements!!!

I vaguely remember playing a mediocre tile laying game, and being very happy when I could put the game away and leave the demo table... and that is all I remember too. I have a good memory for games, and for a game to disappear nearly completely from my mind takes some doing. A '3' is really generous and probably ought to be lowered to a '2'.

This re-implementation of Kachina isn't bringing anything all that new to the table, other than some impressive art and a couple small rule changes.  So really I'd just say it's personal preference.  If you don't have Kachina, then this new game is well worth getting.  But if you have the latter, there's really no reason to own both.

Personally I'll be holding onto my copy of Kachina (I actually prefer that art) but am happy for the opportunity to play this game online.

Decent tile-laying game, elegant concept / implementation, and I like the theme - but in practice, the game was only OK for me. The designer was in the game, which may have been a mild downside, strangely enough: I suspect it might have been more engaging to discover various stratagems in a (fumbling) all-new-player game than to see them revealed through expert use? A lesson I should remember for myself!

RATING: 7.5
No igen: elővettük könnyű kis levezetésnek, aztán agyégetés lett :-).
Kis túlzással.
A játék alapjai az igen nagyon egyszerű kategória. (tegyél le lapot a már lent levők vmelyikéhez kapcsolódva, egy összefüggő sorban max 7 lap lehet, ha nagyobbat tettél mint abban a sorban/oszlopban van pontot kapsz érte, annyit, amennyi lapka van a sorban/oszlopban)
NA de ugye skandináv mitológia, és a lapkákon ottani szereplők, spec tulajdonságokkal: van aki 0-zza a mellette levő lapkákat, van aki megtiltja, h újabb lapkát lehessen mellé tenni, van aki felül írja -ráfekszik, mert h sárkány :-)- a lent lévő lapot, van aki lapot lop, van aki azonos lapokat használva erősíti magát (nahát, csak nem a farkas falkában? (Fenrir)).
Még ez sem teszi vészesen bonyolulttá, de a mostanság divatos: csomagoljunk egyből egy kieget is a dobozba aztán még durvít (s persze okosan kieggel kezdtünk :-)): az itt lévő 4 lap nem akármi:
szakadást hoz létre sorban /oszlopban, kilök lapkát a sor/oszlop vmely végére, végtelen hosszú -akár szakadásos, lukas (nem egybefüggő) sort v oszlopot is értékel (nahát: tengeri kígyó) illetve 2x jössz. Na így már szép dolgok lesznek.
A játék idő 45 perc, nekünk több volt, de azért mert a lapkák tanulása kis időt vett igénybe. A lapkákon jól érthető piktogramok (ha 1x már játszottál), egy hiány: az segítség lett volna, ha rajta miből mennyi, mondjuk az igaz, h vagy 6 vagy 9 db van belőlük.
A lapkáka szépek, a pontozótábláért, viszont egy kisebb koki (ha már ez a magyaros virtus :-)): szép ugyan, de: a pontozó és képes felét felcseréltem volna, szebb lenne.
Szóval ez is tetszik.
Illetve a szabályban 1 részt nem teljesen tiszta: a kilökés. Játszva derült ki, és igazából csak azért nem egyértelmű, mert nincs leírva mit nevez sornak/oszlopnak, mi valszeg rosszul játszottuk, 1 elemet is sornak/oszlopnak vettünk, azaz oldalra is kilöktünk, hisz abban az irányban 1 elemű sor/oszlop, és végére lökünk :-). Vhogy úgy érzem, h talán 2 elemtől számít vmi sornak/oszlopnak. (pl. mert 1 elemet nem pontozunk)

Juego de loseteo puro y duro, que no perdona ni un sólo fallo, pues una vez que te quedas atrás es muy difícil remontar.

Es muy divertido pero las partidas pueden resultar un poco repetitivas puesto que los poderes de las losetas no cambian y se suelen colocar en posiciones similares en todas las partidas. Una vez se ha descubierto la forma de optimizar los poderes de las losetas el juego sólo se basa en analizar muy bien la situación y tomar la mejor decisión lógica en cada momento, de ahí deriva el hecho de que sea muy complicado remontar algún fallo.

I keep looking at this one. I do enjoy domino placing games and the theme on this one is good.... I'm just not sure I would have any one want to play it with me. :(

I sat and played this with the daughter (10) and she won

The rules are simple and easy to pick up and play. Each tile has a special ability however the universal rule if the tile played is the highest in the row/column then you score. Easy.

There is a spacial awareness aspect which the daughter picked up a lot more quickly than I did. I really enjoyed it and so did she.

Szeretem a tile placement játékokat, mert általában egyszerűen és elegánsan adnak nagy változatosságot. Viszont nem kedvelem a nagyon basztrakt játékokat, emiatt kicsit féltem ettől is. Végül talán nem is absztraktsága volt a fő baj, hanem az, hogy ez nem játék, hanem tevékenyég. Az elején még semmi baj sincs, de a végén arról szól az egész, hogy kinek van pofája minedn körben, minden sor oszlop értéket kiszámolgatni 20x egymás után. Semmi ötlet nem kell bele, mindig van egy ideális hely, ahová tenni kell. Egy program 1ns alatt megtalálná helyetted. Erre jön még rá, hogy a lapkák között hatalmas a különbség. Vannak olyanok, amik nem hogy használhatatlanok, de még a másikoknak kaparják ki a gesztenyét. Mások, meg instant 8-10 pontokat adnaka  végjátékban.

Utólag belegondolva, lehet hogy kettesben működőképes lenne a dolog, mert akkor lehetne valamennyire előre építkezni, de négyen ez esélytelen volt.

Voluspa is an abstract that hates to admit it is such. There's some intriguing tile play going on here. It plays out like Qwirkle with most tiles having special powers. Stronger tiles are just that while the weaker tiles have little abilities that influence gameplay. It's the kind of brain teaser I normally go for.  If anything, the game suffers greatly from its thematic window-dressing.  The tiles are glossy and deeply decorated while the entire function of the tile is relegated to the corner, dimly printed and millimeters in size. If this game would just accept what it is, throw out the unnecessary artwork and just print the effects of the tiles, I'd have more love for it. Also, the fact that this game almost demands AP (especially by the end) puts it in the same camp as 'Kingdom' for me. Intriguing game, solid actually, but needs a little love from the functionality department.

RATING: 6
Völuspá is a pleasant little tile-laying game that oh-so-lightly injects a Norse theme.  The artwork is excellent, and the special powers interesting, especially when using the included expansion.  A further expansion (Order of the Gods) adds additional tiles and options, but I have not yet played it.  The game's main drawback is the downtime that can result as players study their options, as well as the limited play area that can also result when certain tiles are played.  It is ironic that one is caused by too many options, while the other is caused by too few viable options.  

What ultimately dooms the game for me personally is that it is simply an "OK" game.  In a world when we are inundated with hundreds of new games each year, mediocre and even good games tend to quickly be relegated to the back shelves or even the trade pile.  A game truly has to shine or offer something refreshingly unique in order to earn repeated table time.  Völuspá fails in these respects.  It is fine, but nothing special.

RATING: 6.5
Fine tile laying game that reminds me of "Auf Heller und Pfennig" or "Beowulf / Kingdoms" whatever you call it.

It's a tactical game that gets more chaotic, the more players you add. So, I would recommend it as a 2 player game only, as I strongly dislike chaotic games.

I'm still not confident, though. I think it's a bit boring, as essentially you are just placing a tile which you score immediately. That's the whole game. Sure, the tiles have numbers (strength) and most have an ability, but you just need to find a way and place to make the most points per tile you lay down.

"Viking Dominoes" is the local name for this. A pretty good tile laying game wherein each play builds upon the tableau, and big plays score based on what came before. It's kind of like Ingenious in that regard. Most of the tiles have special abilities, but there aren't too many and they're not too complicated. The special abilities succeed in making the game interesting without becoming overwhelming. The art is of nice quality, though the tiles aren't exactly huge. I enjoyed it.

Watch out for the 3's... their ability is to replace an existing tile, giving that tile to the player. This is especially powerful at the end of the game, when a player can keep taking turns long after everyone else has exhausted their tile supply. I don't know if I'd call that an issue with the game or merely a quirk, but it's something to be weary of.

I pretty much only play this game on yucata.de, but I really love it. It's more tactical than strategic, especially with more than 2 players. The tile interactions are really interesting. I haven't played with any of the expansion tiles yet, I'll probably add them in at some point.

played once with 3.  Very dry, pasted on theme, but a good game, nonetheless.

Quite mathy... decent long-filler. Probably won't stay in my collection, as the theme is good, but the art is only passable and the mechanic isn't quite strong enough to account for the lack of implementation of the theme for my taste.

I find this game very annoying. You play a single tile onto the board each turn and score points for it. The majority of your time is spent calculating how many points each of your possible plays will earn. It's very tedious and boring but is essential to good play. 

Strategy does exist to some extent although typically you make the move that gives you the most points. Often your moves will help your opponents and there is nothing you can do about it. Especially at higher player numbers things get quite chaotic.

It is an extremely light game with very limited decision space, but it can take several minutes to calculate all possible moves so that you can make that fleeting decision: e.g. 6 points and play an Odin or only 4 points but save my Odin for later.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The problem that I have with this game is that with two experienced game players, the decisions are pretty obvious. By the end of the game there is one best move so you just need to hope you get the right tiles.

Only online play at Yucata.de - This is rightly compared to Qwirkle. There's a bit of strategy to it as you don't want to set up scoring opportunities for your opponents but drawing better tiles is strictly superior to playing better if there's such a thing at all.

Interesting little tile laying game. The random draw is mitigated by the hand of 5 tiles from which you choose 1 to play. The real heart of the game is in the tile special abilities which are where you tend to win and loose it. A very nice little design. Under rated in my opinion.

White Goblin does it again. Make a game that has a great looking box, but disappoints me when I play the game. Its just not good enough, like many other games of White Goblin. But it's not bad either.

First game you are constantly looking at the rules, to reread what the effect of eacht character tile is. Maybe after a few plays this game becomes better, but I don't think I'm going to do the effort. Too much down time with two, and it gets worse as the game evolves. Where is the fun?

Seems to lack a real turn to turn strategy and be too much about just making the move that gives the most points in this turn.

This is an abstract tile-laying game with a pasted on Viking mythology theme.  In it players take turns placing a tile, with the drawn image of a character on it, down on the table to make columns and rows.  Each character type has its own way to score points, and manipulate the rows and columns.  Whomever can do this the best, and score the most points wins.

Despite its hardly-there theme, I liked playing the game.  I don't think I'd play it all the time, but every now and then I would.  The game is challenging, and becomes more-so as it progresses, and the rows and columns of tiles spread out over the table.

If you like abstract strategy games then I'd suggest you look into this one.

Had this game explained by the designer and was extremely disappointed with how shallow and pasted on the theme was. The game has virtually no redeeming quality except that the art is attractive. I question how the designer managed to convince someone to publish this game. Generally, you would expect that modern games improve upon existing games and use existing mechanics in new, interesting ways. I'd say this is easily the worst tile laying game I've ever played.

Played it once. There was some confusion about the rules but most often the special combo was included into the rules. It was an enjoyable strategic game. But you have to be lucky with the tiles you draw. I fear the basic game might get too repetitive after several plays, once you know all good possible combo's. I will not buy it because of that but I wouldn't say no to playing it again.

As others have said, this game can really bog down as players search for that big scoring move. The ever-evolving "board" means you're evaluating everything anew on your turn, resulting in some serious downtime. I've also found luck of the draw pretty problematic. It seemed like some pretty awesome scores came off the Wolf and Odin tiles, of which I got exactly zero in our most recent game. There's zero strategy: try to set yourself up for a combo from one turn to the next, and it's pretty much guaranteed someone else will take advantage of your setup before it gets back around to you. I'll admit I'm not as good at seeing high-scoring combos as other players are, but there are plenty of other games I don't mind losing. This one just doesn't do it for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
'Viking scrabble'. Players place tiles in order to maximise their point scoring opportunities.

It is quite a bit of fun to play (it helps the owner is big into Norse mythology and can describe the characters pretty well) but can bog down a bit towards the end as each player is gripped by analysis paralysis as they try to wring every single point they can from the board.

Our second try added the ‘Saga of Edda’ expansion (that, I understand, comes with the base game) and increased options, depth, complexity and playing time. I get a feeling this one will see a fair bit of use with our lunchtime group (more on that here).

That said I am unlikely to purchase this one.

UPDATE - plays slowly with just two.  maybe one becomes more prone to AP with just one opponent.

A tile-laying and scoring game in the same vein as Qwirkle but with more depth and opportunity for interesting tile placements. 

The theme is well integrated and gives the God powers meaning and purpose. 

A really interesting game. Highly recommended to add in the included Saga of Edda expansion tiles once the base game is learned. 

Could only see this going up another notch with the Order of the Gods expansion.

Artwork is lovely too.

Players are putting down tiles, one tile at a time to try to get the highest value in a row or column. Players will score if the tile is the highest in that row/column, and the maximum row/column length is 7. The tiles have special abilities, such as Loki who turn adajcent tiles to value 0, or the Dragon to cover up a tile, or the Troll which prevents adjacent tiles from being placed. 

I have only played this 4 player, and it didn't do much for me. You really couldn't plan ahead, there's luck in the draw of the tiles, and each turn just try to maximize your points, which takes time to find when the number of tiles increases, leading to long wait times. Based on that, my rating won't be high, but I heard it plays decent with 2 or even 3.

simple inoffensive game, that is a little longer than a typical filler. from a five tile hand you place one tile on the table next to other tiles and instantly score points for the placement. there are 8 different tile types and each has its placement rule. this game is a bit AP prone which is unfortunate for a filler.

Absolutely Love This Game! Very Fun Colorful Med-Light Tile Game with Norse Theme. Reminds me of a cross between For The Win,  and Qwirkle. Easy to learn and teach. Good rules booklet.

The expansion that comes with the base rocks, too. I don't think I'll play without it again, unless I'm teaching the game.

Plays great 2 player.

Makes me appreciate Qwirkle even more. It has the same feel, but is much more complicated. With more than three players all the tilesrules makes for a more thinky but not necessary a better game. With 2-3 it may ecclipse Qwirkle though, because then there is room for clever plays, becaus eyou can set up a good play in your turn (which is impossible with higher player counts).

Fun, thoughtful tile placement game with some impressive art and components. There is definitely a lot of thinking and math in how to lay out your tiles. I have only played with two players but I can see AP being a growing issue with more than two.

This game is a straight-up reprint/retheme of an older game called Kachina.  This tile-laying game can best be described as Qwirkle with special abilities.  You place a tile in a row and score points for the length of the row, but only if you "dominate" it by having the highest value in that row.  However, the values of the tiles range from 1 to 7, and the lesser-value tiles all have special abilities that allow them to dominate rows with higher values.  It's a fun light game.

This game is bordering a 6. I enjoy the game, but it does start to lock up near the first 1/3 of the game and stay like that. I also think it goes a bit long for what it is. Points are a bit too close for my liking, but I think there is still room for clever plays.

Would never play this game with more than 3 players.

I'm having a lot of fun with this one on Yucata.de right now. I ordered a physical copy that should arrive today, after which I will be pimping it out with a draw bag, tile racks, two differently colored marker stones (black for dead spaces and white for Loki's adjacent 0's), and laminated player aids. All of these things are *not* included in the box and I hope they will provide for an even better playing experience.

Völuspá has replaced Qwirkle for me. I liked the hand-management and tile-laying mechanics in Qwirkle a lot, but I always felt it was a bit too simple and yearned for more meaningful decisions. Völuspá gives me these greater decisions. It's another hand-of-randomly-drawn-square-tiles-played-to-a-boardless-grid game that does its scoring in a very similar manner (points per each tile in any line created or extended by the played tiles), but does it in a much more interesting, clever, and fun way by using unique powers!

Referred to this as "Norse Scrabble" and as silly and laconic as that is... it's fitting. There are eight different tiles that you can possibly have (in a hand of five), each being valued 1-8 and each number having a special ability. When you play a tile, if it is the highest valued tile, you score that row and/or column, earning a number of points equal to the number of tiles in that row. Then you draw a new tile. Play continues till all tiles are depleted. 

Rows/columns (both referred to as rows from here out) can only be seven tiles long, so the game slowly grows out. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good tile laying game.  It takes a bit of time to get used to the abilities of each tile and make sure that you are laying them in a legal place.  Once you get used to it the game has a lot of interesting decisions.

So it scores much like Qwirkle.  But it uses the Norse pantheon on the tiles. And the tiles can have effects on the rows on which it is played and those adjacent.

Quite strange tile-laying game, with very simple rules. We've so far only played once, with 4 players, and we weren't that impressed - not only does it seem like there's no strategy at all, just make the highest-scoring play you can (I can believe that this changes with fewer players, and I expect that the game is best with just 2), but we actually managed to break the game, when players realised they could repeatedly play a 3 to replace one already on the board, to score 7 points (yes, 3 was the highest in a row of 7 as there were a lot of Lokis in play), thereby never running out of tiles and scoring infinitely many points. We looked it up afterwards and found the fix was the obvious one that I suggested at the time (a 3 can't replace another 3), so the game isn't broken (but really, how did this not come up in testing and get included in the rules?) - but it's not very interesting either.

29-05-2014. Rated after 3+ plays. Pretty fun tile-laying game, in which you place tiles in rows of columns of maximally length 7. If your tile placed has the highest value in row, column or both, you score points equal to the length of the row. Many tiles have special abilities, allowing you to replace, take back or nullify already laid tiles making for some interesting decisions along the way. 

I have played it with 2, 3 and 4. I know that with 4, I think the game becomes too random and therefore unfun. 
But with 2 and 3 there is some nice tactical thinking and possibility for some light strategies (setting your opponent up). Fun game, I like it.

But there are interesting things to do, and clever ways to play your tiles. There's some luck, and a distinct feeling that every move you make is setting up the next player. 

Great artwork, too.

Egyszerű lapkalerakós játéknak tűnik, amiben úgy szerez pontot a játékos, hogy ha az adott sorban vagy/és oszlopban az ő letett lapja a legnagyobb értékű, akkor az abban levő lapok számával megegyező pontot kap. Az alapjáték lapjainak tulajdonságai is egyre gondolkodtatóbbak minél nagyobbra nő a pálya, így öt játékosnál már elég nagy holtidővel kell számolni. Érdekes, hogy vannak lapkák, amiket végig erősnek érez az ember, vannak, amik az elején és vannak, amik a végén jönnek jól. Nem egy korszakalkotó játék, de szerintem egynek elmegy.

[2016-12-19]
Korrekt dolog, hogy már az alapjáték is úgy került kiadásra, hogy van egy alap lapkakészlet, amihez 4-5 új fajta lapka adható és ezzel tulajdonképpen a játék hossza befolyásolható, mert addig tart, míg minden lapka ki nem kerül az asztalra. Kicsit talán így is hosszú a játék, lehetne valamivel rövidebb. A szerencsének nagy szerepe van, de mindenképp játszható játékról van szó. Egyet emelek is a ponton. 5->6

- you have to check every tile and possible place and then put the best choice of those, this takes too long and is boring
- luck of a draw
- no point to think further since the board chances so much

This game was an immediate sleeper hit in my family.  I had read positive reviews but it sounded a little "reserved" for me but I thought I would give it a try and also checkout the artwork.

Although we only played a couple of games over the Labour Day weekend, it was the first game in a couple of years that one of my sons has enjoyed playing with us so that alone was worth the price of admission - but it was actually a very tense game and was much more interactive than I imagined it would be.

Now, i want to try more expansions !!

Tile laying game in which tiles have variable powers.  Did not seem very fun to me, and I did not like the powers on the tiles (seemed imbalanced).

Love the Nordic mythology theme but still haven't found a game that uses it well. Our group is split on this, but it's either somewhat enjoyable or pretty boring, and everyone agrees that it takes far too long for what feels like it should be a 20 minute game.

Expansions: Saga of Edda, Lightning Bolt, Order of the Gods

Really liking this game, lots of intricacies that are going to take many plays to get used to. I like the 'included expansion' in the box, as I'm enjoying playing the base game and will add the extra tiles one at a time (Starting with Hermod) for a slow creep of complexity =)

A tile laying game with tiles of ascending order.  When a tile is lain if it is the highest number in a row or column you score points.  Each tile also has a special power (except for the two highest-numbered tiles).  This is a very very simple game that just doesn't quite get me.

It plays reasonable fast and is incredibly simple to teach but it is very, very lucky.  Both the luck of the draw with the tiles and simply the turn order can screw you over.  I played a game where I had nothing in my hand higher than a four and saw my opponent play 2 8s, 2 6s, and a 7 in subsequent turns taking an immediate 20 point lead over me.  In another game I found myself trying to set up plays that just handed points to my opponents since you lay one tile a turn.

The fact that you can't really make interesting plays like that without giving points away makes it a very uninteresting game if each round is simply:  lay the best tile to make the most points this turn.  But unfortunately that seems to be the only effective way to play.

RATING: 8.5
I do have a soft spot for tile laying games and I enjoy this Nordic one, too. Each card/tile has a different God power, they can negate and trump each other, so you try to have the highest tile in the row(s) you place it down to score, at the same time you try to not give the opponent good possibilities to score in return. Works great with 2 players, I am curious how multi-player versions work out (but have the hunch this might be better at 2- which turned out to be true imho).
With the Edda expansion it is even an 8.5 for me, that one has some very nice tiles that can score very high if applied right, more strategical planning finds its way into the game, don't think would want to play without it.

RATING: 6
This seemed overwhelmingly to be about tactically scoring a few points, knowing that you were probably going to set the next player up for a higher score. I suspect the game is better with 2 players rather than 3.

As it is, it's a mildly interesting abstract tile laying game with a free-form board. It's not bad, but nothing memorable.

Update: It doesn't really feel much better with 2 players. You can't really plan ahead and set moves up without a) your opponent being an idiot of b) your opponent being really unlucky c) you counting all of the tiles and setting turns up only at the very end of the game when there are no tiles that can stop your plan. A little disappointing really.

Rating down from 7 to 6.

RATING: 6
The art and components are great.  It feels like an abstract with a vague theme.  I found it a bit easy to calculate what my opponent had in hand when we were down to just the tiles in hand.  I think the game might be improved (at least in a 2 player game) by setting aside say..2 tiles at the beginning so you can't figure out exactly what your opponent is holding.

Tried it again with 3 players. I didn't enjoy it as much. It's impossible to set something up on your turn, expecting to still be possible to capitalize on the following turn. Next time I try this with 3-4 players, I need to use a different style of play.

I have tried to like this game, but in doing so I think I've missed the point. Games should be naturally fun to play, and I just don't like this one. The rulebook is frustrating and the tiles don't feel natural to play as a result. I'm always trying to decide how tile interactions are supposed to work, and spend half my time deciphering how to play. Maybe I would like it more if I could understand the rules better, but as it stands I don't really find myself wanting to play this game much.

RATING: 4
BGG says a 4 means I think the game is "not so good, but could play again." Well, that about sums it up. It wasn't completely void of enjoyable moments, but all in all, it's a game where you just play the best tile (of the 5 in your hand) at the moment your turn rolls around. I didn't really see any opportunities for learning strategies. What's more, I didn't enjoy the modifier effects the game delivers with the different tiles laid. What I mean is, I found myself frequently deciding to place a tile, only to then be told, "Oh, sorry, you can't lay it there because...", or, "you can lay it there, it's just not going to get you any points because there are two wolves, and wolves scores combine, so..." 

There were just too many of these moments. It pulled any little fun that the game might have had right out of the experience.

The main drawback of Voluspa is that it takes so long to play. Much longer than the advertised 45 minutes, even with two players. Because of this, it faces stiff competition from other abstracts in my collection. On top of this, I am not sure how I feel about the luck of the draw in the game - it certainly is considerable. Other than that, I enjoyed my play of it on a lazy Sunday, and the artwork sure is appealing. The theme also fits the special abilities of the tiles perfectly, making them much easier to remember that I first thought. Use the expansion tiles from the beginning, as they make the game much more interesting - especially Hel and the Sea Serpent.

OK tactical abstract. The end game bogged down for us though. I think it probably works best as a 2 or 3 player game, where you can probably try to do more planning ahead.

RATING: 4
I'm used to Carcassonne, and this was very fiddly trying to count every row and column to check where I could possibly play, then having to check if I could play the highest tile.  Since you have 5 tiles to choose from, you have more options, but for the group I played with (2 very AP prone people), it meant most moves took 5-10 minutes, and was a total snooze-fest.  For planning, if you are eyeing up a spot, and the person before you takes it, you usually have to start over, because 1 tile addition can eliminate several options.  I would try again with different people, but if I knew Carcassonne was in the building it would be a tough sell.

Oct 2017: We've had this for nearly a year and it's still a fun game when it gets played.  It surprisingly takes longer than expected - I'd now compare it to a more complicated Qwirkle.  Lowering my rating to 8 (from 10), just because we don't play it more than once a month, if that, and the tiles are also starting to show some wear.

Original:
LOVE this game!  Definitely in my top 5 list right now.  It plays great with 2, 3, or 4, making it versatile enough to pull out with just the boyfriend or with my parents.  The basic rules are simple, but trying to remember what each character's powers are get more complex.  My parents struggled with it a little more than we did, but it's not impossible.  I'd consider it a slightly heavier gateway game, depending on how fast someone can pick up "special move" options like you'd see in Chess.  (Actually, I feel like this is a tile-laying version of Chess.)

The Norse theme is what originally drew me to this game.  I looked at it several times before finally buying, and I don't regret it.  No one we had talked to at any game store had played it, but I feel like this game should be much more popular than it is!  The base game now comes with Saga of Edda and has plenty to keep you entertained.  Every game will be a little different.  Your strategy will change as you go, depending on what your opponents play and what tiles you draw.  The more you play, the more you'll start developing strategies for how and when to use each of the characters.  It can be simple, but can also get very in-depth.

+ Order of the Gods: Fun expansion, but not necessary to enjoy the game.  More complex than some of the original pieces.  I love the Dwarf!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I like the game quite a bit, though it's rare that I feel that "aha!" moment when just pulling off a neat combo, too often it's "argh!" when someone steals your combo, and this is ultimately what kind of kills the game for me, it doesn't enable cool combo's.  You try to set something up and you are inevitably setting up your opponent instead.  That gamble tension could be exciting but instead it's pretty frustrating.  Also, far too many tiles that are only situationaly good, which leads to a lot of luck of the draw.

An empty gaming experience, no strategy, no evolution, useless theme, a lot of time lost in looking for the better move, chaotic and most of all boring. It seems a Knizia game when Knizia (my favourite author, remember?) is uninspired and in search for some money (like in Chtulu rising).
Avoid it.

Abstract tile laying control puzzle based on the oldest known poem of Norse mythology. Tiles depict Norse monsters, heroes, and Gods each having a power value and either a placement rule or a special ability. Points are scored for the number of tiles in the adjoining row and/or column when placing a tile with the higest value. The meat and strategy of the game is the when, where and how to place the special rule breaking tiles for big scores without setting up the next player. As the tiles expand, the possibilities will get paralyzing. Nice game system that could be matched with just about any theme and I appreciate how they tied it to Voluspa.

A simple tile laying game with characters with different powers. Can be frustrating at time, when you get behind your opponent one step and can't do much stopping him from winning. 3 players looks better, because you have more chances to take over, but it takes longer, when 2 players match is the best for its duration.

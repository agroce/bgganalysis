1st play: Similar mechanic to BSG but with less ability to track individual players and a theme I like better. I really enjoy the show and that probably boosts the rating a bit. It's hard to really play strategically and 6player is probably a bit too chaotic, but the game was enjoyable. 

2nd play: Quite a bit better with 5. I don't know that I like the game when there's no terrorist but the possibility needs to exist for the game to work. I like that the game ends after a few rounds so it doesn't overstay it's welcome, and I appreciate the thematic integration a lot.

RATING: 7.5
Midway between the lengthy and chrome-filled Battlestar Galactica, and the quick and stripped-down The Resistance, this game focuses on the traitor mechanisms and other hidden roles. There's enough of the TV series to shine through (there could be a bit more, and use of more stills from the show) especially in the mood that's created, although the colour and design doesn't quite do it for me. But the mechanisms seem good, not sure about balance yet, but if it lives up to its promise it's a good solid game.

RATING: 8.5
Similar to Sons of Anarchy, I'm not a big fan of Homeland, but have watched enough episodes to know that the Gale Force Nine board game version knocks some of the feel of the show right out of the park. Homeland is a tense, competitive battle between CIA agents and threats that appear on a board, with nifty mechanics for how each of those threats is put together, and not only a potential Traitor mechanic, but a competition between both Loyal Agents and more politically-inclined opportunist agents that often use terrorist acts to their advantage. You might have to abstract a little, but it's quite good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Now not the most popular game ever but I've given a higher rating because I've played it quite a few times and have mostly amazing experiences with it. A fun hidden role game with lots of tension and interesting interactions. It's very simple but just loads of fun.

Excellent traitor game. Takes the best part of BSG and spins in out to the extreme.

RATING: 3
Despite being a licensed game, the games seems to be well thought out and polished. That being said, this isn't my "type" of semi-cooperative traitor game. In general, I like working with more concrete information and find the luck element palpable and annoying. Mechanically, this creates tension and prevents the game from being one of pure-memorization and dry calculations. But in practice, I find such mechanics to lead to uninspiring decisions based on one's own gut-feeling. Furthermore, using cards for plots/organizations/Intel/case-loads creates a very fiddly experience as players are constantly moving/adding/shuffling those cards and they have a specific arrangement. 

I suspect this game has a large market and will find numerous fans... but I'd much rather play The Resistance.

Gale Force 9 strikes gold yet again.  This time they've taken the hidden role/semi co-op game and applied it to the TV show Homeland.  I've never watched the show, but that didn't stop my enjoyment of the game.  It's basically a nonstop version of BSG's crisis cards.  Except you have a few turns before they pop off.  The absolute best part of the game is that there is no team victory.  Only one person wins.  So you have to beat back the terrorists, but you also need to fulfill your own agenda.  It trims the fat of most hidden traitor games and the result is splendid.

I really like this game for what it is. I don't think that it's very "Homelandish"; the theme and name could've been pretty much anything since the gameplay itself doesn't really contain anything whic makes it _Homeland_ - apart from the named character cards. But I like the gameplay and it's basically an advanced version of The Resistance, but with more actual gameplay and not as much debating/discussions/accusing going on. A solid game of bluffing, cooperation, deception and paranoia.

A decent hidden roles game, but has way too much of an emphasis on players' memory than what I care for. Other than that, it's a pretty fun game. A lot of randomness, but it's not meant to be a deeply strategic game anyway. I've not seen the show, but the theme didn't seem to come across to strongly in the game, in any case.

Players are CIA agents working on their own private agendas in the "universe" of the TV show.  Players are either loyal, careerist, or a terrorist mole, and take turns secretly contributing to the resolution of the many threats facing the agency.  

A nice, well developed take on the hidden role mechanic - see games like Avalon, The Resistance, Battlestar Galactica - but polished here to a fine edge.  I really liked it, but the game felt a little long and it was very difficult to track what each player was doing.  BSG Express is still the best take on this genre of game, I suspect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game of espionage and counter-terrorism will keep you on the edge of your seat. This game is a hit with my group, we don't know who to trust, who is the mole, or who has ulterior motives. The game tips favorably to the terrorists, making it a good challenge. The more players you have, the harder it is. More players = more terrorist plots.

I found this game on a clearance rack at my local game store, and i am glad i picked it up. I even started watching the show after playing this game (which is good also). 

Cons: The board itself has a split down the middle, this makes it hard to slide cards around and up in threat level, As i said before, the terrorists have a steep advantage making it a challenge; the terrorists usually win 80% of the time we play.

I always like trying hidden role/betrayal games. This one plays out a little different because instead of the 1-to-2 bad guys and the rest are good guys, you have 3 different roles: Agents (good guys), Terrorist Mole (bad guy), and the Politician. The politician wants things to fail, but not so often that the game would end in immediate bad guy victory. The most interesting thing about the game, is no matter what team you're on, there will only be one winner. It's also interesting that if the game doesn't immediately end in terrorist victory, the terrorist still has the opportunity to win in the VP tallying end game.

The game has a 5 tiers on the board, with a number of spaces in each tier. When a threat (or "crisis") is at the top tier, it will be resolved at the beginning of the round. Also, at the beginning of the round, a number of threats equal to the number of players are placed. These threats have some hidden info and public info... public info is rewards for dealing with it, part of the more difficulty, determines the tier, and severity. Hidden has consequences of failure and difficulty. So, basically it's dealing with multiple crisis checks at the same time, until their resolved. This makes it very hard to keep track of who contributed to what and remember what's probably ok and what is potentially bad.

It was a decent game. I would have probably liked it more if I had watched the show. I think this would be better with 5/6, in which case I would always rather BGS. I was hoping for this to fill the 4 player hidden role option, but I would rather play Dead of Winter with 4. As a quicker hidden role game for 5/6, I would just rather player one of my faster 5/6 player games. I try to keep a lean collection and this is good, but good just doesn't cut it these days. I'm sure some people will love this and could easily share shelf space with Dead of Winter.

RATING: 3
I am not the target audience for this game, bit if I play it, I must rate it.

The board is a hack me mess of cards tossed about, the 2-3 cards you play a turn (in a game with likely few turns) does not give you much meaningful impact to what is going on (you have all these extra acquired powers and little plastic soldiers, but never enough time to really utilize them.

It is just a pure example of Ameritrash.

RATING: 5
Well, there are some nice ideas here but the game feels unpolished in a mainstream, non-hobby way. Players are either working for the US on the same team but only one of them can win individually or they’re the terrorist hoping things go to pot and they can win that way. Like BSG, you have to deal with threat checks to which some or all the players contribute. 

I did like the way you played to certain threats and the intrigue that created at the table. The intrigue is directed in two primary ways. First, one player is the terrorist and wants the threat checks to fail (like a Cylon), and second, all the other players have their own victory conditions and don’t win as a team. On paper that sounds great to be divided against each other team-wise and individually, but the thing is, mid-way through the game it was pretty obvious who was going after each type of victory condition. I mean, if you need certain chits, you just start openly collecting them and it’s pretty obvious what the deal is. 

Problem is, you don’t remember who contributed to what threats, and soon there are piles of chits on the board that nobody can remember, and then you flip over the threat to see if you all over or under-committed. The threat may give a useful or non-useful reward and may have been a lot harder or easier to deal with. I don’t get the point of making players’ contributions and the rewards blind and therefore frequently wasted. Is that supposed to be fun?

The randomness of the threats and downtime mean you can play for long stretches that turn out to be almost nullified by hidden information. It's as if the first 80% of the game are just to get to the last 20% and see who's going to win. Didn't feel like there was a lot you could do in that first part besides "be lucky" to be in a position to win (which I did thanks to some really fortuitous threat cards in my favor and not in someone else's). 

The game is frequently called BSG lite for how the threat card checks are somewhat similar to BSG and there's a traitor, but for me the result is that it didn't give me the intrigue of BSG nor compelling enough informed decisions to hold my attention. Some development here could've refined it into something a lot more interesting.

As much as I like hidden role games, this one really didn't do it for me. I'm not familiar at all with the source material, so perhaps it would appeal more if I was. But even so, I feel there are many games that do what this game is trying to do in a cleaner fashion (The Resistance, Battlestar Galactica, Shadows over Camelot etc.)

One of the biggest annoyances for me is the sheer amount of cards that end up piled up in their various sections on the board. All must remain secret and all must be variously moved about and shuffled which just creates a lot of fiddling about for no real gain. This doesn't help the already problematic downtime issue.

Not the worst, I could be talked into playing, but I'd also more readily suggest a different alternative.

8 is usually the highest rating I am willing to give a game after only having played twice. The rating is more likely to go up than down with more play.

Given that this game is still relatively new, my rating and comment here might help others decide whether this is a game they would want to own/try.

Mechanics wise, very similar to BSG. Major differences: the obvious one is time - the 6-player game took 90 mins, and the 4-player one took 60 minutes. The other major difference is that this is a solo-win semi-coop a la Archipelago. Players who strongly prefer team games with hidden traitor(s) may not necessarily like this. Personally, I enjoy solo-win semi-coops, but I like team hidden traitor(s) game even more. Nonetheless, I enjoyed playing Homeland immensely.

The perfect social deduction, semi co-op game for me, particularly at lower player counts.

It fits the theme, there's a bit more weight and strategising in the mix, and it keeps everyone engaged with the action and tension.

Only flaws are that it can become too jumbled with higher player counts and there's a bit of a learning curve at first, but nothing too drastic.

Successful thematically but gameplay is rather thin. Compared to Battlestar Galactica, it has the advantage of less rules overhead and quicker playing time while not giving up the story element. For a eurogamer accustomed to finetuned mechanisms and challenging decisions, Homeland hasn't much to offer. Assign two out of usually three cards to threats, buy asset cards (giving special skills and VPs) or soldiers/agents, check threats with them. Luck of the draw and blind cardplay are highly random. The metagame with the focal traitor discussion is entertaining for a play or two but there's nothing to keep my interest.

Played once so far with 5 people. Rating might change with more plays. At first the game seemed hopeless. We quickly had 11 of the 12 terrorist points and were about to get steamrolled. 

Turns out it was just bad luck (and a traitor) - we stabilized things and won - sort of. The terrorist traitor in our midst still had enough points to win - but the agency put up all 12 points.

It was exciting and would definitely play again.

I'm not sure why this game is so low rated. Granted, I am generally not a big fan of hidden traitor or semi co-op games,  so maybe I am just missing out a lot of the nuances, but to me this does everything I would want BSG to do but in half the time. Sure there aren't as many different color of cards  and you can't use cards for alternate effects, but there is still the same mechanism of contributing good or bad cards to a pile that needs a certain value, and there are still varying resolution effects. I like that there is no person who has to switch sides halfway through, the neutral people while mostly helping the good guys can occasionally pick their battles, and the bad guy can mess people up outside of just contributing cards by drone striking certain threats.

I like the powers of the assets, but the assets in general seem to be too worth it, as they give you roughly as much VPs as the tokens needed for them, while also giving you special powers.

A streamlined version of Battlestar Galactica, and once everyone is familiar with the rules even a 5 plyer game can last for just 60 mins. It gets many things right, however as each player's actions are very limited which makes it much more difficult to deduce who's the terrorist(traitor).
A nice game in my collection. It just lacks the epic feel.
Edited on 29/9/2015: After 2 more games at least 1 is won by the agents. All of my games are 5-player, and it's very easy for the terrorist track to get filled up too eagerly by the politician +/- the terrorist. It is of paramount importance that new players should know this situation well before, otherwise many would be disappointed by the relative easy win of the terrorist.

The game felt quite full with 6 players. Like many games with cooperative elements, it felt completely lopsided in favor of the traitor.

RATING: 7
One of the most underrated semi-coop games out there.  Yes, the game gets very messy with the cards, but you get the same experiences you get with Battlestar Galatica and Dead of Winter within 1 to 1.5 hour time.  There is no "soft player elimination" like DoW and BSG with numerous tools the players can use to screw each other over.

What's really surprising about this one is everyone starts on the same playing field and the exact same tools.  The only difference between all the three "agendas" is how they score.  Whatever a terrorist can do, a Loyal agent can do, and vice versa.  This makes the game very skill based.

That being said, it still suffers issues from other semi-cooperative games where the game can drag a little longer than it needs to and the meta becomes very apparent after a few games.  The rulebook could also be a little bit more clear on certain situations.  Also, if you hate messy components and numerous fiddly mechanics, you will despise this game.

Very well produced traitor game which distils the best of Battlestar Galactica into a quicker format. Better with more players.

This is one in a series of great licence games released by Gale Force 9, the others being Spartacus, Firefly, Sons of Anarchy and Star Trek.

Not a bad bluffing game at all. The major problem with it is that it's entirely skewed to the terrorist mole. Out of four games, the agency was handily beaten. All of us agreed we'd rather invest the time to play Battlestar Galactica instead.

RATING: 6.5
I didn’t enjoy my first play of this game.  Drew a good asset early, which was stolen immediately.  I spent the rest of the game not doing much, and couldn’t really get into the game at all. On the cases where I took the lead, only one of them crystallised before the game was over.  Needed to go after more advanced cases and have people help me out.  Could just have been playing against people who understood the pacing of the game better.

I’d try it again, but would need a much better experience to be convinced for a 3rd time.

I have to say I really really liked the game... [company=11420][/company] are killing it with all their games, specially taking into account that they are officially licensed board games for TV Shows and we all know how those things usually turn up... Hats of to GF9.

You don't have to have watched the show to enjoy the game, it sure does help because you can relate to the assets and the Terrorist Organization that are Plotting the Threats, but it's certainly not required.

The game is going to get compared to [b][thing=37111][/thing][/b] and [b][thing=150376][/thing][/b] for obvious reasons and to me this one has some stronger points and some weaker points...

I find that Homeland is a game that can get more table time because it's more streamlined that the other 2... it's easier to comprehend and easier to explain... it should also be faster than the other two

I think that thematically the other two games are stronger than Homeland.

Much like GF9's other games, Homeland is a really fun game, but it's missing something that really takes it to the next level. Essentially this is BSG without any of the flavor. It also feels like the game is beating down the players constantly, so the terrorist player has a much easier time of winning. I can see people wanting to play this distilled version of a more epic social deduction game, but it just doesn't have enough theme to keep me invested.

Played twice in past two days. Took us a full game to start to understand the mechanics and understand the flow of the game. By the end everyone had a good grasp of what was going on we started really getting into the theme as we all started to mistrust the actions of everyone around the table. The Bad guys won the first game which was interesting as none of us were the terrorist mole. Decided we needed to play again the next night and decided as a group that we needed to play better as a team. While I think our team work was much better, the terrorist mole revealed herself on the final round and drone struck the plot that would have secured the good guys victory. She then proceeded to reveal the next plot which overwhelming went for the bad guys and won her the game. Who would have thought my wife so devious! I'm still thinking about how she managed to fool us all until the last minute. This game really made me think and we had a blast (no pun intended) playing. Really looking forward to playing it again. Great game.

A game of co-op mission completion with an dose of betrayal in there via a terrorist.

Needs players who have played at least 3 times before to have fun otherwise its very confusing and too easy for the terrorist since plots are so punishing and the game can end in a few turns (in fact it is often quite clear when this will happen as eventually and sometimes rather quickly a turn with 5 or 6 terrorist plots that will resolve is going to happen, and thats usually the end of the game).

Bitterly dissapointed with this game, I probably expected too much from Gale Force 9 (I love most of their games) & the theme of Homeland (being a watcher of the show). Not a game or adaption that I can endorse.

I stand to be corrected, but it seems to me that, given the age in which we live, there are relatively few games that tackle terrorism as a theme. Too soon?  This is an inter-agency semi-cooperative game where players contribute cards BSG-style to tackle escalating an advancing threats. It is a good game that is definitely a cut above the majority of TV tie-ins - as expected from publishers Gale Force Nine.

A co-operative game (or at least a semi-co-operative game, as at least one player will be a bad guy). Game play is pretty simple, and I guess it does an OK job of representing the show from a high level. If players don't work together, things can quickly unravel though.

The best bit of BSG with a hint of DoW: dull board made up for by the tension. Probably too easy with no mole, but that's an unlikely situation. Over three players, the mole has a tough job but it's always been close. That last minute accusation swing is very important.

Mediocre.  Takes the mechanisms of BSG, and strips out the atmosphere.  Replacing it with, well, nothing really.  Leaving behind something that felt very mechanical.

If you like the BSG card play mechanism, and haven't yet had your fill of hidden traitor games, but somehow don't want to play any of the decent ones, then try this.  But "bland and uninteresting" would be my three-word caution.

Sold to me as a lighter Battlestar alternative. I can see the comparison, and there is room for clever play here, but I'm not a fan of the aesthetics or the fiddliness of stacking and sliding cards all over the board. It bothers me enough that I rarely feel like suggesting the game.

The cards slide all over the place with playing, but other than that component issue it's a fun time.

10-05-2015. Rated after 1 play. Homeland is an interesting cooperative game, with traitor elements. There are 3 distinct roles, there are loyal agents, a traitor an a semi-traitor, who revels in a little chaos but not too much.

Homeland is mostly card-based, each turn as a player, you claim a 'case'. Then, you put a card from your hand underneath 2 cases, but the first one has to be under someone else's case. You get new stuff and abilities.

I did like the game, but I felt that it was too fiddly. Too many small piles of cards, which I sadly didn't like overly much. In our game, we had a lacklustre group and the thinking and accusations never really surfaced. I wonder if repeated play solves this.

I am not yet in love with this game, and I suspect I might never be simply as I don't active am going to seek this one out if I can play either Dead of Winter, BSG or Shadows of Camelot I like better.

Rating after 2 games. I really like the discussions and cooperation needed to win against the terrorist; you really need to work together (or appear to do so, as the mole) even if everyone is looking out for number one in the end. You really question everyone's motivation a lot of the time, with the subtlest of acts. (Why did he not activate those two assets before, they could add 5 and 4 red or blue! Is he the mole and trying to tank the next two threats? But why then activate them at all when the mole/terrorists are winning on the track already anyway?)

RATING: 7
Semi-coop hidden traitor games are not something I play very often, but they can be lots of fun with the right group of people. Homeland is a good addition to the genre that may see more play in my gaming circles than the venerable Battlestar Galactica, due to Homeland being significantly simpler to explain and faster playing than BG. On the other end of the spectrum sits Resistance, and Homeland is definitely a step up in complexity in comparison to Resistance. So all in all Homeland is good choice for people looking to play a medium weight hidden traitor game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Homeland is a well presented, well themed game with little let up in the action of terrorist threats being revealed and advancing in intensity.  

Trying to keep track of all the information flowing onto and around the board is a daunting task and the excitement in seeing how the next threat resolves is very engaging, as is trying to guess who is playing which of the (up to) three factions sitting around the table while trying to keep your own agenda secret. 

A big hit with my games group, I've already played fewer games than some members as they are quick to grab my copy and get another play (or two) under way.

The game can be a bit fiddly when having to move stacks of cards up the board, but that's a minor complaint.

It's a hidden role game based on the TV series Homeland. It was better than I expected since it seemed like a mass market game. Overall though, I'm not a fan of hidden role games, but would prefer to play other hidden role games than this. The main reason being that there were so many threats, even if you determined who was on each team, there seemed little you could. This game overstayed its welcome in my opinion. Also, the card piles on the board became very fiddly.

My first warning bell for Homeland came during the initial round set up, when we randomly dealt out the first set of cases, only to deal out a whole bunch (I think it was 4) that would resolve at the end of the round. Essentially, it all-but guaranteed that the terrorist would get a bunch of easy points to start out.

I like the idea of the political agents operating to balance the game, but it all felt very mechanical and honestly, I checked out pretty quickly. We still managed a tense and close finish, but I was long past caring. Mechanically it is pretty dull, there's far too much downtime, each turn is uninspired and there's too much randomness in the card draw for my liking. As with many GF9 games, they seem to have taken an existing game and tried to simplify it for a mass market. As usual, they've stripped out what makes the game interesting; agonising decisions, limited downtime and clever mechanisms.

RATING: 7
This is a secret identity, bluffing, deduction semi-coop game which involves a lot of table talk. I like the game, but I think the game requires several games and experienced players to flow more smoothly. It is literally fiddly.

First, it is easy to forget some player actions.  Thus our first three games were "oh i forgot to do this", "did you take that action?" etc. which detracts from the game's focus and fun. 

Second, card playing is literally hard to handle. For example a threat consists of a plot card that is under the organization card on top of which lies smaller intel cards, a player card, and some small miniatures. One of the player actions is looking at the plot card that lies on the bottom. This always took a lot of effort - as these card sets (i.e.,threats) are surrounded by other threats - to the point that I did not want to do this action. Moreover, at the end of each round you slide all of these threats on the game board. The game was hard to handle physically.

The rating might go up if these issues improve with more plays, because I felt like I couldn't focus on the real game (deduction and bluffing).

RATING: 7
I'm on the verge of having too many of these types of games (Dark Moon, Dead of Winter, Bloodbound, Good Cop Bad Cop, Avalon) but this one seems promising and does a few things differently.

The biggest difference from those other games is that there is one winner. Some people are on the same "team" in the sense that they have the same goal, but only one person will win.

Another thing that this game does differently is having three different "teams." You have some people who want missions to succeed and some who want missions to fail, like in most of these games, but this one also has people who only want [i]some[/i] missions to fail.

The gameplay itself is luckily pretty simple, which leaves more room for watching your opponents' moves. Essentially there is just a series of missions from The Resistance. Each player plays cards onto different stacks, and those stacks get shuffled up and analyzed. If the red value is higher then the red team basically gets points and players suffer some sort of penalty. If the blue value is higher then the blue team gets points and some sort of reward.

You also get "assets" that basically give you ongoing special abilities. These can vary wildly from giving you a lot of points to giving you free stuff when you take certain actions. These add a good amount of variety to the game.

My only issue is how fiddly it is. You have to lay out a stack of cards in a certain order, sliding cards underneath other cards and sliding those stacks of cards around the board. It's just a bit of a pain.

No rating yet because I've only played part of a learning game, but everything seems positive so far.

Pretty interesting and reasonably well implemented theme - it's just a shame that most of the terrorist organizations are from the arab countries (but I guess that might match the events in the show). The game plays really well with five, which is the only player count I've tried yet.

1 of the logged plays have used my copy of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tentative rating until (if) I start to understand the game strategies a little more.  This is definitely a game that requires a few plays to really start to understand what people are doing and why.  In fact I feel like all the players would have to be pretty experienced with it, so that you can try to glean information from the things they are doing.  If they are new they will make random decisions.

The game itself was pretty interesting.  I thought the scoring mechanics were a little wonky, and I wound up burning assets (and any chance of winning) to save the Good Guys and give the "win" to a Agents over the terrorists (I also guessed the terrorist and stopped them from the backdoor win).

I'd be interested to see if the scoring started to become an interesting and cutthroat part of the game with more experience, that could definitely increase the rating.

The play time is great at 60-90 minutes tops.

I've watched all five series of this CIA abroad themed game where players take roles as advisors, some of whom are loyal and true, some are out to gain political prestige and one may even be a terrorist, out to blow up the infidel.

RATING: 7
I'm starting to wonder if Gale Force Nine is ever going to miss with one of these licensed games. While not quite as good as Spartacus or Sons of Anarchy, Homeland is still head and shoulders above most of the 2015 releases. It plays more or less like Battlestar Galactica, with one side trying to fend of disasters while the other side tries to secretly create them. The game also features a third side, that of the politicians, who want enough disasters to happen to create political opportunities, but not enough to actually cause the collapse of the country. As you might expect, a good portion of the game play is trying to ferret out who is working for and who is working against you.

This part of the game is the only real downside to the whole thing. What makes the social deduction side of the equation work is planting support or opposition to various terrorist plots. That sounds cool, but the reality of it is a lot of time spent fiddling with tiny cards. Moving them, rearranging them, looking at them, switching them...In the end, it's a lot of wasted movement.

That's my only complaint, and it's a minor one. I'm sure if there was an easier way, they would have used it. Overall, it's a solid game and thankfully, doesn't require knowledge of the show it's based on. Terrorists are trying to strike, you have to stop them. That's all you need to know to enjoy it.

Homeland promised to take some of what makes Battlestar Galactica interesting and pare it down to a 90 minute length. I’m not a huge fan of the Battlestar license and I’ve only played the base game once, but I do think Homeland does an admirable job of taking the suspense and double-guessing of Battlestar and greatly reduce the play length. In our particular game, I was a (bumbling) agent and between me and the other agent, we managed to succeed at two plots, both worth no points. While the terrorist player managed to win by scoring out multiple plots worth quite a bit. Definitely a game I want to play again, though I’d suggest playing with more than 3.

Semi-coop CIA analysts with secret agendas fight to counter global terrorism with a possible(likely) betrayer in the group. Direct agency resources to deploy soldiers and agents and recruit assets.  Events arise as threats, secret card play on case files to help pass or sabotage the threat. Semi-coop is somewhat of a misnomer. There is only one winner even if you work for the same common goal. Bluff, deduce and remain on constant alert for inconsistent player actions.

This is, surprisingly, a really great game. It is one of the best semi-coops out there, especially since it's not merely the good guys vs. 1 potential bad guy. Some may be in the moral grey area of "political opportunist". This really adds debate and mystery to who is who, which makes for engaging game play. Overall the design is pretty good. My only complaint is how the cards stack on the board. A game can look really messy by the end of the game. But that doesn't mean the game play isn't fun. It's just an esthetic observation. Otherwise, it's definitely worth checking out, especially for groups of 4 or more.

Due to the high number of terrorist plots, it is difficult to play enough blue cards to counter each red card's count which ensures easy victory for the terrorist faction.

After 1 play. I liked it. 

It played fast. 90 mins after rules explanation with 5 players. There is some downtime between players but it's not noticeable because (a) turns are usually quick and (b) you are paying attention at what the others are doing.

I was the political opportunist and found it difficult to understand what i was supposed to be doing. I wanted to keep myself hidden but i think it hurt me in the end and i should have helped more plots succeed than i actually did. I only decided to openly go against the Agency at the very end. One thing i did not realise is that it's best not to reveal to others who you believe is the Terrorrist in order to earn the VPs on your own. Very different compared to other games such as this one.

The rest of the group had mixed feelings. 2 were ok with it, 1 did not like it and 1 hated it. I'm not selling it for now as i want to try it with other groups.

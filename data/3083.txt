Excellent game.  Had many hours of fun with this one.  Rules easy to learn, but difficult to really master.  Size of the gameboard allowed for a lot of varied game types to be created.  Most fun with a gamemaster, with the surface ships being played by one player and submarines by another.

RATING: 7.5
Lots to get your teeth into.  This was a lot better than I thought.  I had expected it to be a mite dry, but actually there's a fair bit of atmosphere in this and it does give a very good feel for a wolf-pack-type situation.  You can make the torpedoes run deep or shallow with consequent advantages and disadvantages, you can "lie doggo" in the water, you can turn on a sixpence in a corvette.  Lots of extra scenarios in old Avalon Hill Generals, too.

Plotting movement in submarine games = Plodding play in submarine games.  Slow, dull, tedious, disjointed, and above all BORING. And that's a boredom NEVER to be interrupted by 'moments of combat's sheer terror and exhilaration' - nope, just keep Plodding those moves on the Movement Plodding pad....

Found (along with Intern, Track Meet, and Caesar games) at a thrift store drop off, ready to be trashed. "No one will buy them" the guy told me when I asked if I could take them. They are all basically new games with slightly worn boxes. This one's tiles are (mostly) still attached to the cards.

Great game.  One player takes the submarine or submarines while the other player takes the surface ships.  It can be stressful for the submarine captain as the surface ships begin pinging you while you try to escape their attacks to either leave or set up for another attack.

Good balance of complexity, level of detail, and speed of play.  The record-keeping in the advanced game is not tedious because you can keep track of, for example, your battery usage while underwater, or turns reloading the torpedo tubes, if you are only doing it for 1 to 3 subs. Only really works if sub player has hidden movement. Units from all theaters so you can create any non-coastal sub action, real or hypothetical.

An excellent game that requires a lot of skill; if you just want to ride in and torpedo ships at will then get another game. Video games might be the best way to simulate u-boat tactics but Submarine makes it equally tense and fun for the escorts. Best of all is that it offers a wealth of options; you can use not just the standard German, Japanese, British, and American vessels but also Italian, French, and Soviet  submersibles, warships, and of course the hapless merchantmen.

Could not find people willing to play so I gave it to a friend. It is a shame for this game to just gather dust.

Quickly became repetitive, which makes sense: it IS sub vs escorts and convoys.  But the setup, and the "Battleship" style searching drove my friends away in droves.  Pre-plotted movement was/is also a sure way for a game I play to end up gone, or on the shelf.  Certainly today, computer sims handle this type of play much better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a sub sim sold in a box as a wargame.  With that said, it is the best of its type I have ever played (as long as you trust your opponent, never a problem with me).  Played a lot in college.  Lost in a flood and re-purchased.  It did a good job on a real tough subject matter.  Very good balance between realism and playablity.  Very possible to play multiple games in one night (how many sims can you say that about?).  Most fun ever was a 3 player game with two U-Boat players that were not allowed to talk to each other about gameplay.  I seem to rember I sank at least one of the swine!

Dropped a point as I get older as I hate pre-plotted moves more and more...  Not so bad in this game with only one ship to move and it moves only 1-2 hexes a turn...but still...

needs house rules for freighter movement; a 60deg change of direction every turn is ridiculous (circle the wagons, boys!).  with that fixed, the game is pretty good.

Most of the time I played it with one opponent - quiet good - but the rare occasions, where we played it with more players (i.e.: 3 or 4) it was a blast!
I haven't played it for years now (so many games, so...) In my heart it has a 10!

Good Submarine simulation.  Solo scenario available.  Each turn represents about 50 seconds.  Somewhat unrealistic intelligence for the submarine player in FTF games, but this is easily overcome with a GM.  Lends itself very well for PBeM!

RATING: 5.5
One of the fist true 'wargames' I had - and I got it primarily because I liked the solo sub scenarios hunting convoys.  Never really played large scale historical encounters with it - but I liked the potential.  Basic vs. advanced rules let you customize how much detail you want - keep things simple and sacrafice some accuracy and detail level in order to speed up play, or use advanced rules to gain detail at the cost of extra charts, rules, etc.

RATING: 6
Plays quickly and creates some tense situations when torpedos and depth charges hit the water.  Players need to be prepared to do a lot of mental calculation to play well - you need to be able to picture the consequences of your movement plots as well as enemy capabilities.

You *do* have to play with the hidden movement optional rules to get a real experience out of it.  They're not a great deal of work, but call for some book keeping and pencil time.

although mechanics of this game are little old (lot of paper tracking). I think it models submarine combat very well. You sweep your sonars over vast waters of see trying to find that damn submarine which just sink 2 ships from your convoy. Submarine player desperately maneuvering to get another shot or run away from all those DDs and frigates. tension of submarine combat is there and adds a lot to gameplay.

I thought this was great in it's day, and played it a lot, even solitaire with wolfpacks, plotting out all the moves. Yeah,I was nuts. This game suffers from a lack of time compression. Sub attacks and escort depth charge attacks just took far longer than as portrayed in Submarine. I think an entertaining game could be made on this subject using interesting abstractions. Maybe some sort of card game. My days of playing games like this are over, I'm afraid.

AH edition. Does about as well as a traditional board wargame can be expected to with this difficult subject. The rating is for the game as played "out of the box," where even under the optional/advanced rules the submarine has perfect intelligence (it's actually more nervewracking to play as the escort commander). But double blind/refereed I bet this would go to a 9 or a 10.

Relatively quick-playing game involving submarine warfare of WW2.  The rules were easy to understand and execute without too much thumbing through the book during play (the rules rewrite on BGG was instrumental in this regard).  One major gripe is to note that submarines do not have hidden movement in the basic game, without which the game seems unbalanced and unrealistic.  Yet another example of "basic rules" being simplified to the detriment of playability.

After playing Submarine solitaire off and on for 30+ years (mostly working out my own revision to incorporate out all my historical and nautical house rules) I have recently begun playing it using VASSAL--amazing!  That has to be the best way to play this game, with hidden submarine movement, hidden torpedo movement, and the addition of the Up Scope rules from the General (Vol 19, No 6) to restrict the submarine player's view of the board when the boat is below periscope depth!  Brings out the patient stalking game to a "T", as the escorts just try to keep the boat down so the convoy can escape!  Based on this experience I have upgraded this game to a "9"!

I've always been interested in running a game using the French Surcouf boat, ether as a what-if French sub, or in it's later duties after the British took it and used it for convoy escort.

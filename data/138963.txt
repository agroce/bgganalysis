This is basically the same game as Sherlock Holmes Cosulting Detective with the storyline located in H.P. Lovecraft’s Arkham. As of this writing I am yet to play the all the scenarios but the start has been really solid. At least I was able to immerse myself into the world of Cthulhu and my mind has been occupied by the story for a couple of days after playing. 

Personally I enjoy playing the game very much and would recommend it to anyone. Rules are extremely simple to teach. You just tell everyone that you are supposed to collect clues and evidence from the material supplied with the game. Everything has to be done within a limited amount of turns after which you are to answer a number of questions to see how well you did. 

Could be played solo but I reckon 2-3 players is the best number. With 4+ players, the debate over where to go and what to do can become quite heated and it will lengthen the game.

Excellent adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective framework to the Cthulhu mythos! Well written and engaging case. My only criticism is, when is the next one coming?

A few too many dead ends, and a bit less focused than SHCD, but I liked the theme and ambience better (and I'm not even into Lovecraft!)

This is an incredible game. I wholeheartedly applaud the creator for making this experience. My friends and I enjoyed it immensely.

I bought Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective a while ago, and then ran across a link to this game while trawling for info about upcoming SHCD expansions. Downloaded the two cases, printed out the newspapers and the map, and read the case books and directory on my computer (which I highly recommend since you can then search for your locations in the casebook).

My group had a blast. The cases require less deductive leaps than in Sherlock (if you go to the right places the answers are fairly clear), but nonetheless the investigations are very satisfying. Arkham Investigator even IMPROVES on the Sherlock Holmes formula by adding in "Requirements" in some locations, meaning you have to have gathered certain information from elsewhere before you can get full access to the information available. Loved it.

If you are a fan of Lovecraft or the Call of Cthulhu rpg, you should absolutely play this game. If you are not, this is a fantastic introduction, and in fact it may even make the game more fun. If you are knowledgeable in Cthulhu mythos you can "cheat" a bit with your metagame knowledge, which does dampen the mystery slightly.

Super kudos to Hal Eccles for designing such a fantastic experience. I'm VERY impressed with the quality of the product, and would absolutely have shelled out cash for it. The fact that I was able to get it for free is downright sanity-wracking. Thanks!

Now called Mythos Tales it's very similar to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective with a couple of key differences.

I enjoyed this game and like the addition of the requirements element as this adds something more to the game when compared to consulting detective.

There were 3 games running at our club and the various teams took a few different turns with scores ending up ranging from -5 to +45 points.

RATING: 6
PnP game based on Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective.

A 'chose your own adventure' kind of game book where you have to solve a mystery as efficiently as possible to win the favor of your mentor. Comes with two cases. First one plays like a tutorial to the mechanics. Second one adds some aditional mechanics and isn't as straightforward to solve. 

It's awkward that the game rewards you for engaging with as little of the content as possible by causing you to lose points for every non-essential location you visit. Personally I don't care for the scoring system, I think the satisfaction comes from just 'working it out'

My partner and I played this together and enjoyed discussing the possibilities with each other, but there are no 'mechanics' that make this anything beyond a solo game.

We solved the second case even more efficiently than the mentor in the game, cracking the code with only three of the clues, and we're then punished for not knowing all of the clues - despite being told that time was of the essence! That was quite disappointing. We decided to award ourselves 5 points for every location Armitage visited that we didn't need to.

Was defiantly worth printing out - got about 4 hours of entertainment out of it.

Absolutely nil replayability. Trying not to let that affect my rating too much.

Arkham Investigator is basically two fan-made cases for Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective placed in a Lovecraftian setting. (Any comments or descriptions you might find referencing additional cases are referring to Mythos Tales.) There's a new map, a new directory and new papers, and a lot of work has gone into the presentation. The writing is fine but in need of much editing. It is notable that aside from dropping the occasional "brooding" in the rules and case introductions, the text is not a Lovecraft pastiche but emulates the game that inspired it, and I suspect this may be for the best. What you'll think of the cases and their solutions likely depends on what you think of the original game. Like the old Holmes, the new one occasionally cuts corners, relies on frustratingly vague reasoning, or cheats outright. The fact that you're investigating supernatural occurrences and not trying to find conclusive evidence of mundane crime doesn't make that much of a difference when the game is still coy about what you're supposed to account for and how many moves you should expect that to take (and the rule compensating you for being "too fast" is lamentably dropped). In the end, partly commendable for preserving Consulting Detective's good aspects, and partly disappointing for inheriting the bad.

So cool that the designer and publishers allowed this PNP before its 2016 release! Can't wait to get the full, retail version in my hands. This is essentially Sherlock Holmes meets the Cthulhu Mythos! Two of my favorite things, and it's really well done! I stumbled upon this gem from a post on Facebook.

2 Cases Completed

I liked it (Case 2 was way better than Case 1) but I'm not a Lovecraft fan. Don't like the universe. And after 2 cases I can confirm it. I cannot wait for the new German release of Sherlock Holmes CD (maybe next year). Love the Sherlock universe.

Arkham Investigator it's surely a great game if you like Lovecraft.

Well, printed and played it.  I hope the cases in the published version are harder than this one, as it was way too easy and straightforward.  Something I always enjoyed about Consulting Detective were the dead ends and the need to do more extensive sleuthing: there was almost no challenge here.  Atmosphere not too bad and the writing decent enough.  Nice graphics.  But I don't think I need to get the published version.

This is the first pure deduction game I ever played. I am giving this a 9 just for the experience - the setting, the excitement, the half baked theories that float around and the tension in the air as we get closer to the solution make it worth the effort. Can't wait for the full version of the game.

Great effort on this. Nore that the game is likely to be very dependant on new scenarios as once you have played through you then know the answer. Id rate it an 8. But have to dock it 1 point for designer self rating.

[thing=138963][/thing] is the younger brother of [thing=2511][/thing] and, likewise, is an unusual game.

First, the amount of rules: read the introduction of the case. Now, go wherever you want whenever you want (following the map by using the Directory, which contains the adresses of everyone of interest, and also the adress of several business locations) and talk (read) with the people there. Read the newspaper of the day, if pleases you. Also, you might want to talk with some fine folks that usually are aware of things (some Allies, but it might be tricky to know which will truly help). Now, also whenever you want, you can return to present your fiddings regarding the case to Armitage. The case will contain some questions, each will be worth an amount of points. Then, for every location you went beyond the amount that Armitage did, you will lose points. Here you don't really compare the amount you achieve with that of Armitage (Holmes would always get 100 points). Yet, you can apply the same and then you can feel good or bad, depending on how well you did. And that is it. Well, less than it, actually, since my last bit of feelings is more a thing I added. That is all the rules.

In every case you will have at your disposal: the booklet of the case (you can always consulte passages you read), the newspaper, the Arkham Directory (the adress of many things and persons in Arkham) and the map of Arkham, and this one, by the way, one of the players (we played in 4 people) thought it was utterly unnecessary, since how close one thing is to other, or the relation of one to another, wasn't playing any roll in the case. But then, in the end, the game hit us hard in the nutsack for not using it properly (you know, as a map). So great.

[thing=138963][/thing] is, probably, one of the most pure experiences of playing that one can have. There is no board (the map is not a board, you don't take action on it, you use it, as I pointed out, as a reference), no meeples, no pieces, no tokens, no money, no cards, no keeping rounds (though, you can see every new location as a new round), no gameplay time as we usually time it. What there are: reading and talking. After the reading of what happened in the case we started discussing: where to go? With whom to talk? What information we had? What means this or that? What about visiting the school for girls? And after we decided to go to a place, and the reading of what occurred there, we returned to the discussions. And now what? What we take it from this? Which lines/leads we now can follow? Usually quite a few, but it was worth our time to follow most of them? Which was more likely to actually advance our case? What was the place - or the person - with the best chances of providing clues? We compared notes, explored options, created scenarios - this because of this and this. Yes... but what about [i]this[/i]? Well, [i]this[/i] I can't explain properly right now. So, which place or person would shed light on this matter? I think this one. But wouldn't he just say what we already know? Then, we can take a chance here. Yes, it can work. And things went this way during the whole game. [thing=138963][/thing] is a game of pure deduction, taking notes, clashing options.

A play of [thing=138963][/thing] ends when the players want. You can visit 10 places, 50 or two. The decisions are yours, always. You know you are "running" against Armitage, but you did not know how many places/persons he went/talked to. I doubt that in any of the cases Armitage needed to go to 50 places to solve the case, but the main question here is: which is worth more - beating Armitage or solving the case? For us it was solving the case, and only after we had a solid overall view of most of the things in the case, and a scenario that answered (for us) most of our own questions, that we went to see the end result. And this can't be taken lightly: once you read the solution of the case, you probably won't be able to ever playing it again since the challenge will be gone. There aren't any variations in the set up, nor event cards, nor different characters to take - the case will always be the same, the result will be the same, the clues will be in the same places.

So, yes, [thing=138963][/thing] has a "due date" - after the 8 cases, it is over. Except by reasons of really weak memory, disease and amnesia, even many years after playing you won't be able to fully enter a play of one of the cases (since, you might start not remembering things, but then something clicks, you remember, and now you basically can't participate). However, this is all that much important? There are lots of games I bought and probably won't clock 8 plays of them. But, more relevant, a game that gives you 8 memorable experiences? I can't, as up to right now, say that it will actually be 8 memorable experiences, but the first case was, and I doubt that the others will fall short.

The amount of work of the authors in the cases is awe inspiring - the newspaper and so many places with informations (most not relevant, but there, anyway). One thing I wished it was present in [thing=2511][/thing] I found here: an internal clock. Sometimes it matters reaching a place in the morning, afternoon or evening. This is simpy great and adds a lot both to the difficulty to the theme and consistence.

The key difference between [thing=138963][/thing] and [thing=2511][/thing] is the supernatural: it is part of the first. You must be open to consider it, to think in such a way that the occult, the Ancient Ones, the powers from beoynd the veil are true and work in mysterious ways. This make things harder to come up with solutions, as we leave the realm of usual possibilities and the "everything that is left must be true" got a whole lot bigger. Yet, the game provides enough clues for even those that aren't fans of the Mythos and Lovecraft to get to the answers - it plays fair, but sure, knowing your Mythos will help.

And [thing=138963][/thing] gives that true feeling of being instrumental do fight evil, without actually engaging in monster fights. You won't carry many shotguns or do spells here - yet, you will be able to thwart evil schemes (or, at least, be of help to Armitage).

While [thing=138963][/thing] doesn't have the originality and charm of London and Holmes, it compensates, a little, with some ingenious decisions and challenges regarding the cases. I won't spoil, but they are good! 

It was a night of talks, and exploring in our minds. We visited places, talked to people - and even going to only 14 different places, still the play lasted for almost four hours! The play reminded me of when, in college, we discussed books in the class of literary analysis - many views trying to reach an overall acceptance of the intent of the whole thing. 

Anyway, I'm totally excited to tackle the next mistery!

Print&Play game based on the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective game system. Played the first (and only it seems) scenario solo, to decide if it was worth buying SHCD.
I did buy it, so I guess it was a nice experience with Arkham Investigator ^^

[+] I loved "choose your own adventure" books, this is the boardgame version! I also love mystery books, I don't know much about HP.Lovecraft's lore though, but it was not needed for that scenario. 
[-] SPOILERS: it was my first try, so of course first thing I did was visit the crime scene and got attacked myself... same thing at the end, I knew the last location visited was going to be the end, I could have "not" visited it.

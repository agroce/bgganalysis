Beautiful game (especially if you are good at painting miniatures), but the mechanism rely on luck, there is a bit of overhead in terms of changes to the situation you must remember from turn to turn, and ultimately, I would rather play [i]Sails of Glory[/i] instead.

If you are a fan of the Warhammer Universe, you will love it. Otherwise, the odds are 50:50.

Looks great (especially with painted minis), very thematic, and quick playing, encourages table talk and bravado. But it's pretty random, with the results seeming to depend on the card draw and of course the dice. Not sure there's much strategy in a small encounter, but perhaps when you know the game you can field a bigger squadron, choose particular ships, develop a strategy, play more complex scenarios etc. so I'm open to the idea there's more there.

Decent game with excellent components. Being quite random  it may avert people from playing it. I like it a lot. It is a combination between standard boardgames and miniature wargames, being neither the former nor the latter, but a synthesis of their individual characteristics.

Preliminary ranking at 8. Play seems short, but sufficiently complex. A lot of players seem to complain about randomness, but that's just kind of the nature about games workshop games - you mitigate the random factor in order to win. Personally, I love it - it drips theme and the models are awesome (though oddly really tough to paint. Definitely a new challenge I'm not used to!

Update: Still great components, fun painting challenge, gameplay CAN stagnate a bit.

This game just oozes theme. The components are amazing and with painted miniatures it's such a beauty on the table. Gameplay is great fun as long as people know what they are getting into. This isn't a naval skirmish simulator as people falsely tend to expect. This is Eldritch Horror/DungeonQuest with ship skirmish in heavily story-driven scenarios. The game contains a pretty high amount of randomness but if you are willing to take it on the chin, there's a great amount of fun to be had. Really love this game. Takes an incredible amount of space though, huge table needed... or 2 smaller ones.

I am profoundly impressed with the quality of the models, and the value for what you get in the box.

The game play makes a serious attempt to eliminate a lot of the fiddlyness of naval combat. Clear and precise rules for movement, firing and boarding cut down on the amount of debate that usually surrounds boat games.

For those who criticize the random elements of gameplay, I feel it is important to mention that Dreadfleet is supposed to simulate a desperate battle in a magical maelstrom of death, not the battle of Trafalgar, ;) (and in any case house rules can easily tone down the random element).

Wanted to see what GW did and I am not dissapointed in terms of quality - but in terms of storage - very much -> especially that after you put together all the ships - it's rather difficult to store all the ships in this "tiny" box.

RATING: 9
There is a style of game that I like and it isn't adored by all, it doesn't have creative mechanics, it's just about pushing models around, rolling dice and having fun. That is where this game succeeds. For some the randomness is a dealbreaker, but for me that's what makes each game interesting even though it may result in momentum swings due to nothing more than a card draw or a dice roll. Those moments though create the narratives and narratives are memorable.

RATING: 8
Potentially, if you drew a bad fate card, its conditions were met, you failed your saves for your ships, and then drew a string of the worst damage cards you could get wiped out in turn 1 without having made a decision. This is not a fair game, nor is it really a strategy game. It is however a lot of fun if you buy into what it is trying to do going in. Dreadfleet essentially recreates the end battle scene in Pirates of the Caribbean 3, the one where the ships are fighting in the giant whirl pool. You have ships with silly abilities, lots of random events, boarding actions, captains duels etc. You have limited control but it's a great spectacle.

What an amazing production. The models have to be seen to be believed. The rule book is a breeze to learn and is really well laid out. 
Like many, i would have preferred thicker card stock. The sea mat is amazing, though some times can get caught on the rough plastic of the ships.

Any one who is even slightly interested in miniature gaming should at least try to play this game.

I don't regret a penny of the £70 it cost me.

My boyfriend has the worst luck in this game, we played twice now and each time he gets chased by bloodsharks turn one... I fire a lucky shot and managed to hit his powder store blowing up his ship deck and setting him on fire. :D

Tactically a bit simple .... ram your ship into theirs before they ram into your and then let battle commence... but this might just be because we have only played the first couple of scenarios.

Still cutting out the pieces and sticking them together, so this is a tentative score based on the amazing components and what look like a decent ruleset with interesting scenarios.

EDIT:  Have played the first scenario.  With only 2 ships on the board, there are too many opportunities to repair and the game took quite a long time.  That said, it was quite fun.  There's a lot of dice rolling and randomness but it still felt like our decisions mattered.  Am looking forward to playing with more ships.  Still leaving it at an 8 for now - could go up if playing with more ships is as fun and fast-paced as I'm expecting it to be.

EDIT #2:  Played Scenario 2 and bumped the score up from an 8 to a 9.  This game has so much character and is so much fun to play.

Naval ship combat with pretty miniatures and a slightly-too-large 4x6' game mat.

The two factions' ships are all unique, though cannot be customized. The random events deck can be overly punishing at times.  The provided scenarios feel a bit sloppy.

I personally feel that Star Wars: Armada is vastly superior(theme & setting aside)to this game.  Played Dreadfleet quite a bit until Armada released, which provided a similar feel, with cleaner design, and some customization.

Still, I wouldn't be opposed to the occasional (rare) play of Dreadfleet.

Juego de combate naval basado en Warhammer Fantasy

Buen juego de la materia aunque en algunos aspectos tal vez se sale de madre un poco. Muy buena ambientacion (a lo cual el espectacular pintado del juego ayuda) y un festival del dado, no apto para los no amigos del cubico elemento :D

Personalmente dado a elegir un juego de 1vs1 de miniaturas me quedo con xwing o con un wargame borg, pero este es una buena opcion para variar.

Although not advertised that way, this game is basically a re-do of manowar.  They simplified and streamlined all the record keeping and damage systems into an easy to use card based system.  

The components are pretty incredible.  The ships all look excellent and the miniatures have plenty of raised detail making them easy to paint. The mat that comes with the game has great art on it (look closely in the ocean) and the cards have excellent graphic design as well.  The rulebook is glossy, full color, and full of flavor text.

Some board gamers will complain the miniatures weren't pre-painted.  Tough luck, but minis gamers who want to paint their sets themselves are the target audience here, not you.  

The gameplay is pretty typical of a naval miniatures game.  Movement, firing, boarding actions.  Movement is based on your speed in inches, which is effected by the wind if you are a sail operated ship.  Bigger ships have worse handling, which means a smaller minimum number of inches before a turn.  Broadsides firing are very simple and accomplished by dice rolling, and boarding actions are resolved in a similar way.  

Overall, Dreadfleet is everything I would look for in a light naval miniatures game.

The great things about these new ultra pretty GW titles are many.
Assassinorum being a duplicate example.
Let me explain;

Euro dabblers buy these games
Non miniature hobbyists buy these games
Dice haters buy these games
Randomness haters buy these games

And surprise surprise, they hate it.
Then tell everyone on the geek it's shit 
And rate it accordingly.

Loads of copies appear on the 2nd hand market in mint
condition, with just the shrink removed.
I buy it for less than half price. 
The useless shitehawks @ GW get zero pence from me.

I get to assemble, paint, roll dice, and have crazy random laugh out loud memorable moments with my gaming buds.

Then, even if game is poor, I have a gorgeous looking paint project, some mint terrain, and a huge sea gaming cloth, all for 20

Keep it coming fools....Mwuhahaha

I am going to pass on Dreadfleet.  I'm sorry to see it was produced as a boardgame, instead of as a full miniatures game, such as Man o' War.  That really limits replayability for me.  I also don't care for the disparate nature of the two sides.  We've got Arabian wizards, High Elves, Dwarfs, etc. all on one side vs. Tomb Kings, Chaos Dwarfs, Skaven etc. on the other.  That seems kind of silly to me.  I hope Dreadfleet doesn't flop, as I would still like to see new editions of Necromunda, Bloodbowl, and Warhammer Quest at some point in the future.

Ignore the publisher. Close your eyes pretend you don't know it's one of 'their' games. 

Hidden beneath the publisher is a tight tactical table-top miniature game. As with almost all games in this category, luck plays too much of a factor for my liking, but you can influence the outcome by playing to the strengths of your ships. 

Pros: 
- superb & beautiful components (if you can overlook/enjoy  the assembly)
- fun game play
- good game-length.

Cons: 
- perhaps a little too much luck involved.
- some might dislike the assembly/painting (I love it!)

For someone who paints miniatures, this has great value for the plastic included alone. The level of detail on the minis is incredible, plus a great variety of sculpts.

A beautiful and thematically-rich miniatures game let down by poorly-balanced scenarios and occasional bouts of overwhelming randomness (like when I got the card that allowed my Skaven ship to blow up on command, which I promptly used to sink my opponent's entire fleet).

This game works fine, it just leaves me flat.  That's American for there's something unidentifiable missing that would make playing this game a great time.  You want to love that GW is returning to making boardgames, please do more of that.  Certainly a lot of love went into this game, you see that in the rulebook and some of the components.  And as a John Blanche fanboy, I love that someone made a lavish game implementing his crazy drawings as reality.  That makes me so happy.  I am only rating this as a game experience.

Ok the materials included with the game are decent, if this retailed for $60.00 or $70.00 I might take my rating up to a 7 or an 8.

The cheap dropcloth playmat, yes 10 nice little minis but and some terrain ... but seriously this is five bucks worth of plastic.  Some cards (not the higest quality) and some cheap dice.  This is NOT worth the fat price GW charged.  Its my fault, foolish fanboys like me keep their prices artifically high.  I have left the stable in terms of being a 40K/WHFB player and this is likely the last GW board game I'll buy.  Don't get me wrong I'll gobble up the FFG GW titles like there is no tomorrow but after Space Hulk and now this game I see that GW is just making cash grabs with games like these and I'm done.  

The game play is a little too random and somewhat complex for non-GW fans to get into.  Its really only slightly less complex than say a game like Uncharted Seas or Dystopian Wars (full blown minis games).  I can't comment on the balance of the game yet as I've only had two games so far.  I'd say the minis are cool and you get alot in the box, so if you literally have 115 bucks to just waste on something that is mediocre and won't be supported in future .. sure go ahead.  I give this stinker a five out of ten. And yes who is the fool .. me ... for buying it.

The canvas is the most beautiful component that I've seen in a board game.

I'd like to play an RPG with the minis, but it's likely I'll never play the board game again. The game itself is simple, which in and off itself is not a bad thing, but I don't think the rules support the theme and story enough.

This game does not fit our group, because using a measuring stick to move your pieces is so inaccurate that the guys start arguing.

This seafaring miniatures game is a bit out of left field for Games Workshop and is almost a love letter to their much earlier game Man 'O War. This is everything you would expect from a GW game; excellent theming and miniatures, great story, and rules that are quite thorough and complicated but offer a very deep tactical game.

I presume it's an established fact, that Dreadfleet is primarily about the art and beauty of the components, rather than the gaming experience. Surprisingly it's not a bad game, by far, but if you look for showing your wide knowledge of naval strategies, look somewhere else. However if you are into pirates and undead, it can prove itself as a great device of story-telling, and for that I'm happy to have it.

Dreadfleet is a fast and dicey fantasy pirate miniatures game for 2-4 players.

It looks fantastic, with a seascape map so sexy you may be tempted to buy it for this alone!

Unfortunately I am no modelling pro these days and with plenty of assembly and painting to do I just didn't get round to it!

My experience is from using the same rules system but with ships from Pirates of the Spanish Main instead in a custom game I made myself!

It is as dicey as you'd expect from Games Workshop, and it is very chaotic- don't be surprised when you are blasted down and out by a lucky volley from the enemy.

On the plus side it has wonderfully clear movement rules that imitate the steering and sailing abilities of ships very well (even if the wind itself is a little abstract).

Shooting, boarding actions and duelling are all down to dicing, and its efficient and quick to carry out.

All in all its a nice stand alone game that would carry a fair amount of extra appeal for the miniature modelling and painting types.

PIMPED TO THE EXTREME! I have finally finished the first version of my  hybridised game that combines both Dreadfleet and Pirates of the Spanish Main (I'm calling it 'Dreadfleets of the Spanish Main').

It uses most of Dreadfleet's rules, plays up to 4 players and uses Pirates of the Spanish Main's ships and terrain for infinite combinations. So far play testing is helping to spot creases that need ironing in terms of rules and stats, but the game is showing plenty of promise! Can't wait for the next game.

Only managed to a few games in so far but this is looking really good.  The components blow pretty much every other game out of the water.  There's been a few 'ship based' games released recently (things like Battleship Galaxies) - this one seems the best of the lot, mainly because manoeuvring is important in this one.  It's got firing arcs, wind speed and direction is modelled, the damage system is great - it's pretty unlikey a ship will be destroyed in one volley, they tend to get steadily more and more roughed up as the game goes on.

Initial comments before playing:

Components 8 of 10 (loses one point for the formatting of the rulebook with no separate scenario booklet or reference sheets, and one point for using plastic pieces for things like treasure which should have been thick cardboard tokens).

Cannot comment much on rules or gameplay yet. Campaign rules are tragically bad. There is a lot of randomness. Doesn't seem to be any outstanding rule that makes it any better or worse than other war games GW have made.

I really wish GW had made a proper board game and ventured out of thier comfort zone rather than producing another ruler and dice war game.

RATING: 7
I rate the the gameplay as a 6 (a bit too random, not enough feeling of control, ships seem to heal up by the time you reel around to catch them, several other issues) although I really love the card status/damage system (it reminds me of Warhammer Fantasy roleplaying game).
HOWEVER, I rate the amount of models and quality of models a 9 (close to a 10).  I will be using these in Man O War, and I think $84 for the models included is a great deal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Wow, just wow.  The model detail is on par with any other miniature you can buy, and the gameplay really lets you feel like you are maneuvering huge warships at sea. 

The rules are easy to pick up, and the game can be played with multiple people (the box says its two player - but each person can control their own ship - they last long enough in game to do so.) 

I only mark it down by .5 for the fact that you have to assemble and paint the minis.  And without buying the battlefoam for it - there is no way to store the amazing minis.

Can't wait to try it. Huge Man O War fan and love the fact that GW is at least putting out some other games rather then just their 3 main ones. Got a pre-order in and will probably get a second copy for more minis.

Got it an have already assembled the ships and started painting. Rules are a mix of Man O War and Gothic with some wings of war card damage mechanics thrown in. Should be fun to play, will try it this week.

Played a couple of games and it's really quite good, not Man O War but that's ok a very smooth yet random game system.

Very good game actually. Extremely detailed and beautiful looking ships. Rules are complicated but easy to learn. A large watery boardgame cloth too. A very tactical based game. Reminds a great deal of the classic Man´O War.
Would be very nice if they would release some wellmade Expansion packs for this instead of just having it as a one off release. Certainly a game that will be played from time to time, but would have scored 8/10 (maybe even 9) with a cpl Expansions.

  Got this cheap sealed and brand new. Even thought there were no expansions hence limited edition. The set itself is perfect. I love boardgames with miniatures and 3d scenery in it and this set gave everything I wanted. Had been deciding between warhammer 40k or dreadfleet but comparing the time understanding the rules and mechanics of the game. Have you seen 40K's "rulebook"? This set definitely made my choice.

Couldn't resist the lure of this. For Space Hulk I was happy to buy the game sans models and use earlier marines and stealers; in this case, I had to have the whole thing. Once painted, will I ever get a chance to play it? Feasibly not, but I hope so. 

Biggest pull was the lavish John Blanche art and general Blanchesque aesthetic, surely some of his best GW work? Admittedly, I haven't seen much GW stuff since the late 80s, so maybe I've missed some gems. 

Edit: Finished, the game looks absolutely as ravishing as photos lead one to expect. This really bears the hallmarks of a labour of love for someone or ones at GW. I have played a few games. The game itself is OK, sthe mechanism for event cards/wind I found a bit of an annoyance. Playing with the ships though is just great, and the overall gameplay experience is situationally sublime (but mostly I would certainly just prefer to play something better).

(NB rated as a model kit this would be an unhesitating 10)

Extremely beautiful, finely crafted game.

It takes forever to paint everything, (if you want to)

But the game rules are easy to understand and the game play moves along once everybody gets it.  

Real downsides, you have to be creative in order to let more than two play at a time, and it is on the expensive side.

Upside, it is a unique, pirate style, ship to ship fighting game, that includes many supernatural elements.  It is a tactical sea battle.  Enjoy.

Beautiful miniatures and some nice elements in gameplay. However I found the wind rules to be more irritating than inventive. (Man O'war has better wind rules - funnily enough.) Also the sheer number of cards which end up restricting a ship due to the damage and lives lost on board, becomes very cumbersome to administer. Also, like most tabletop games - arguments can easily spring up over line-of-sight issues.

Commissioned someone to assemble and paint that miniatures. it's fun just to look at. The game is a work of art. It's a better game than it's given credit for. The measuring and turn tools make it easy to accurately move and shoot. I'd like to find a large plexiglass sheet to lay over the beautiful cloth maps so ships can slide rather than having to be lifted. 

Trouble is finding opponents Warhammer players have generally snubbed it and historical naval war gamers have trouble with the fantasy aspect.

I wish i could like this game. It has everything i like. A magic fuelled vessels, characters with their own stats, and a funny combat system based on them, and their vessels. This game is also so beautiful executed i love ships models and background.The "Playmat" is not really a high quality job, but it looks beautiful. Still, something is not right. Something is not really working in this game. Combat itself is great, but other than that, game is pretty painful to play. 

I don't really like wind mechanic, although i understand it's important. But i belive in normal ship combat on full sea wind is not changing directions so often.

 I also don't really like how executed is movement in this game. Maybe it's just me, but this mechanic is troublesome and it requires from you to be very precise. It's also very long. Most of this game is you thinking were you could do some damage, and you trying to move your ships, then is a combat phase, maybe some wind changes, and then your enemy is trying to figure how to move. It's boring.  Game also can be random, but in a fun way.

 I can't say this game is bad, but it didn't take my interest for a long period. Still, i'm keeping this game, because coloured ships looks beautiful on my shelf.

I rate it 10 for component's and content.  I never played Man-o-War so I can't compare against that, but this is what I consider a self-contained game, which from GW is impressive.  I feel like I can get solid game play from what's in the box and scenarios without having to spend endless coinage for more "stuff" from GW.  The rules are fairly tight and it plays as much like a board game as it does a minis game.  The average play time is also reasonable.  Overall for game play I'd rate the game at an 8+.  I'm crap at painting minis but this set is a mini painter's heaven.  The price point seems reasonable given the current cost of molds and plastic.  The cards are good quality and thoughtfully used as a way to track events and damage.  The playmat is cake icing.  Mmmm good.  I can even use it with some other seafaring games I have.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and look forward to some 1 on 1 ship action.  FWIW, I paid $95 online for mine, combined with another game for free shipping, and no tax, so $95.  From a collector standpoint, I predict this will be another Space Hulk 3rd edition type game where in another 5 years or so you'll only find it online at prices higher than current retail.  Of course I'm only basing that on past GW marketing practices.

Picked up a 2nd copy.  Why you may ask?  Well, first off I like the game.  But 2nd, I don't like assembling models, and it had all the ships already build and primed, and one was even painted to GW standards (makes me want to take up painting). I still thing this will be a grail game eventually and prices even for used copies aren't dropping much if any.

This is still waiting for me to get started on painting. Pity as the game itself looks very interesting.

Traded a copy for a pristine copy of Game of Thrones The Card game + two expansions at the UK BGE 2014

Traded another copy for Elder Sign with promos, also at the UK BGE 2014


Decent nautical game. when not taken too seriously, or compared to Man'o'War, it's a pretty good game, all round. Would like to play this more

Including matching battle foam for all parts, partially painted, cloth mat has a little defect on one edge. Bonus: White dwarf magazine with painting article.

Yar!

1. You get a barge-load of incredibly detailed plastic in the box.
2. Very pretty cloth map. Thin, but nice. Will look like a million doubloons when graced with fully painted pirate ships, I'd wager, me hearties.
3. Rulebook is pleasantly illustrated, and adorned with many full-colour shots of impossibly well painted miniatures.
4. Smallish bog-standard dice.
5. The event cards have fantastic titles and abilities. I like/love cards that describe such things as the 'Spear of a Sea God' thrusting up through the waves and lancing your galleon. And 'School of Bloodsharks'. And 'The Bone Hydra Rises', type/style of theme-enhancing cards.
6. A great mix of scenarios.
7. Movement threading is welcome - so that all players are involved in the turns fairly equally.
8. The addition of auxiliary vessels is terrific - it's a nice idea to be able to expand your fleet by launching a Cog, or a dragon, whilst rowing into battle. An interesting dynamic.

[b]The sound of cannonballs smashing timber:[/b]

1. Massive dice-fest.
2. Chaotic higgledy piggledy of ships.
3. Random punitive nature of the event deck.
4. Long term planning is slim, as the weather and other elements constantly change with no early indication of those developments.
5. Assembly and painting of models is a hobby - this is not a 'normal' boardgame, cast from the mould of Monopoly or its loftier descendants.

[July 10, 2012]: I have not played this game yet, but this is my fist attempt painting minatures.  Currently, I have everything cut from the sprues and filed smooth.  My goal is to have this painted up by the end of the year.  

The components of this game are stunning!  From the high quality cloth seascape to the inclusion of everything needed to play this pirate-themed battle.  I really like this set very much and I hope gameplay is just as excellent!

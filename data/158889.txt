I really wanted to like Summoner Wars. The box, divider and neoprene mat quality is absolutely out of this world! The cards on the other hand are weird bridge-sized, thin, and very ugly. It looks like someone from DeviantArt was hired and then Events were lazily copy-pasted. Guys, never ever combine a deck of random cards with random dice rolls. It makes for a game that despite knowing nearly every strategy and tactic available, almost always turns out random unless your opponent is significantly dumber than you. In my group, we have over 80 hours of this game under our belt and that's when we force ourselves to play. It has some great ideas and some really neat factions but just get this one core set and don't bother expanding it if you're really into competitive games. This is somewhere on the spectrum between "competitive" and "party" games.

A new board of neoprene and 6 new factions.  
And the best part, dividers for ALL the factions released. This truly is an amazing game...

I'm gonna echo what others said: Its like Chess + CCGs. Each factions plays asymmetrically different and the Alliances Master Set provides tons of replayability.
Also, neoprene mat is always a plus.

The new board is nice, not sure if I like it more or less than the old Master Set board, but nice to have two different options.  The 8 new alliance summoners are really interesting and different.  But the best part of the new set might be the box, that has room for everything released so far (even in sleeves, if you swing that way), well organized, with printed summoner-specific dividers.

RATING: 8
Did not expect to enjoy this one as much as I did or get hooked on it so quickly. Captures the feel of a miniatures war game with only a deck of cards. Each faction feels different and has a significantly lower cost than any miniatures game while scratching that same itch. No model building. No painting. Just playing. Fantastic.

Hozza a szokásos szintet, sőt az eddig próbált 2 fajnak egyaránt volt valami extrája, az egyiknek egy külön idézhető lénypaklija, a másiknak meg elég speciális volt az eseménykártya használata (maguk alá tudták tenni spec képességként). Szóval úgy tűnik a 8 új faj még tud további színt hozni a játékba. Elnézegetve az ezres nagyságrendű kártyát, elgondolkodtam, vajon mennyi játék lehet a Summoner univerzumban? Ha nem akarunk pakliépítéssel szarakodni,  és a 16 fajt + 16 második summonert + 8 kevert faj paklit vesszük alapul, akkor gyakorlatlag 40 paklink van, az 780 féle párosítás. De ha figyelembe vesszük, hogy a kevert fajok az alap fajokkal kombinálhatók, plusz vannak reinforcements paklik és még a Mercenaries-ok is bekeverhetők bármelyik fajhoz... Bő 300 fajta teljesen más jellegű paklival simán számolhatunk, de azt nem is vettem figyelembe, hogy pl. a Mercenaries ennél sokkal több varit tud belevinni, mert nagyon sok féle lény van benne. Tehát 50 ezer féle alapvetően különböző párosítást mindenféle gondolkodás nélkül létre lehet hozni, és egy jól sikerült párosítással simán lenyomnék 5 partit akár egyszerre is. Ha az érv egy játék mellett, hogy sok parti van benne, akkor a Summoner mellett erős érvek szólnak.

Ami fura volt, hogy a kevert faj néhány lapja hivatkozik az alapfaj lapokra, de mi van ha én nem keverem be őket? A másik, hogy a Fallen Phoenix-nél túl erősnek tűnt az a 9 életes nagy cupák, a Summoner-rel kombinálva két partiban is simán végiggázolt az ellenfélen. Gondolom ennyi féle párosítást már nem tudnak letesztelni, biztos lehet találni olyan fajt, ami simán megfogja.

Also have the original Master Set + Filth Deck + Frick Deck + Saella's Precision.

Fun, light tactical game where cards are used on a map akin to checkers or chess. Cards have variable powers (represent units and what not), and you have a draw deck where you can pull additional summons / events. You accrue resources by murdering enemy units or discarding cards.

The included neoprene mat is awesome so I loved the game before I tried it. I've played three times and love it. My wife likes streamlined rules and minimal text and enjoyed it. It feels like a simpler and slightly chess-like Mage Wars.

Alliances factions are 8 combinations of the 16 factions introduced in earlier decks and are generally considered a little more difficult to grasp, so lots of people recommend starting with other decks before getting this set. However, the box and mat are so awesome that getting this set first is a great way to ensure that you'll be wanting to buy more and more until the box is full.

The more I play, the more I like this game. It reminds me a bit of chess. You have a chess-like board, your Summoner is comparable to a combo of the King and Queen in that it is quite powerful (like the Queen) but lose it, and you lose the game (like the king).

I find it much more fun to play than chess and not as draining. There's no point calculating your moves too much because there is the randomness of the dice that can mess with your plans major style.

I personally love the luck of the dice, annoying as it is when you are on a bad run! It keeps things uncertain, you get little twists and have to adapt plans. I think it helps replay value.

This is such a cool game. I've upped rating from 8.5 to 9.5 and it might possibly go to 10.

The game feels a bit to me like, how can I take chess, and make it fun?

I love chess too, but I have to be in the mood. Summoner Wars, I won't turn down a game, and the big number of factions and varying powers and units and reinforcements is plenty.

My son enjoys tailoring his deck.

Summoner Wars is an awesome game (and that’s coming from a eurogamer!). As I’ve not played this edition a lot so far, I cannot comment on all of the factions and how they interact with the other summoners, but my first couple of plays of this game have been intriguing. The factions in this set are definitely more complex than the regular summoners as the abilities are not so ordinary, and several of the factions have new features and new types of units and event cards.

In my first play, it seemed that the Vanguard Vargaths were overpowered, but in the next game they lost, so once again it seems that everything is balanced (although I personally think that the VV is one of the stronger factions, but again, I haven’t played all of the other factions). 

Summoner Wars: Alliances Master Set is more complex than the base game, so I wouldn’t recommend new players to buy this first – the original Master Set seems better for casual play (and I rate that a 9), but for those of us who love SW and cannot get enough, this is a great addition!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I already own the original master set, and I rate that a 10, so of course I'm predisposed to like this.

What does the Alliances expansion add? Beside the dizzying amount of replayability, you get faction dividers, a box to contain everything, and a wonderful foam board. I've got enough to play this game for quite some time without ever tiring of it, and so far, the new factions continue to add unique playing characteristics that amazingly remain balanced.

8 new decks and a great box to organize you SW collection, plus neoprene mats. The added combo factions have some really interesting mechanics (I'm looking at you Deep Benders and Sand Cloaks). These decks play well with all the original and Second Summoner decks. I have played many cross games of this type and have had luck on either side of these new factions. Great purchase. Thanks PHG.

besides being a great game, this box is amazing! there's room for all the cards released to date, even with sleeves on; and then there's still one third of the box free. also, it comes with dividers for all the summoners and reinforcements plus the next 8 summoners to come.

the width and length of the box is the same as that of a folded up playing board, the old style from the first version of the master set, so a couple of those can be thrown on top of the box. that will prevent the lid from going all the way down but that's fine. it also comes with a neoprene play mat.

and, if you don't have all the old cards and are worried about your cards flailing around inside the box, well then there's a couple of foam fillers included in the box ^^

If you've every wanted to try summoner wars, this is the definitive place to start in my opinion. This is a base game (ie neoprene mat, damage + other tokens, and rulebook) with 8 new factions. These new factions are considered to be of a more complex nature than the master set and the factions released before it. The factions released after the original Master Set have embraced a design philosophy of having no 'catch-up events' and these new 8 factions live up to that philosophy. This set is also great in that the box holds everything released so far and has dividers for every faction released thus far as well as for the forthcoming second summoner's that haven't been released at the time of writing this.

The cards from a particular faction deck have interesting deckbuilding characteristics as well as deckbuilding using these summoners. Each summoner is a mash-up of two factions (ie Tundra Guild is a mash-up of Tundra Orcs and Guild Dwarves). If you were to deckbuild with the summoner of the Tundra Guild, you could include Tundra Guild, Tundra Orc, or Guild Dwarf units/champions. When deckbuilding with Guild Dwarves or Tundra Orcs, you can include Tundra Guild units/champions in either because they count as both factions. So, this set is fantastic and will certainly change the meta, if you like to do deckbuilding. If you don't like deckbuilding, you can still enjoy it as 8 new factions to battle against other factions you own.

If you like summoner wars or are looking into giving it a try, this is a no brainer.

I really wanted to like this game. It looks cool, the concept seems sweet and some of the card abilities and characters are awesome. I just can't handle the luck of the dice roll combat system in this game though. It's too easy to loose characters and too difficult to summon new ones. My gripes are not only mine, and from what I've read in discussions of this, fans of the game play it despite them. My group didn't enjoy the game either, so I got rid of it.

A single entry for all of the factions released to date and the Master set.  One of my favorite new "Indy publisher" games.

I love that all of the factions play differently, and yet are still balanced.

Summoner Wars is certainly a game that one would do better with multiple plays. Knowing the different factions is a definite advantage. Regardless, it's just a fun game overall with simple combat but interesting ways with how factions interact. Also, the hand management aspect is very good as well and creates a nice amount of tension. Luck can have a bit too much to say when it comes to combat, but enough savvy control over units can diminish the luck. No different than any other straightforward dice-driven combat. Sorta has a tinge of Blue Moon to it. Nothing really bad to say about SW- it's a nice game!

Have not fallen in love with any of the factions in this set yet. The complexity on the armies and how they work continues to ramp up (as is expected). Yet what I love about SW is how simple the armies are yet how different they feel to play with or against! The more convoluted armies tend to suffer because of this.

Love playing on the neoprene mat.

RATING: 9
When Summoner Wars first came out, I liked the game, though the paper map was a real turnoff for me. I was never a fan of the expansion packs that simply added to existing factions since, as previously discussed, I don't much like sitting around constructing decks/armies. Fortunately, Summoner Wars plays extremely well right out of the box. This box in particular, with its mousepad map and excellent storage system is a boon to long-time players, but a fine entry point for new players as well.

The basic concept is that each player has an army made up of cards that move around the board. It almost feels like a miniatures game on a hex map, except it’s the cards themselves that move around on card-shaped spaces. Not all cards are units; some of them are spells that can be played for immediate effect. 

One of the really brilliant things about this system is how the deck is used. Not only does it contain your units and spells, it is also a source of currency used to bring them into play. Cards from your hand can be placed into your Magic Pile which is used to pay the summoning costs of your units. Since you refill your hand to 5 at the end of each turn, it's tempting to build a ton of magic. However, your deck is razor thin, and if you do this, a few rounds in you will have a full magic pile and no cards left in your deck to spend it on. The balance this requires of you is difficult to do properly, and in fact there may not be a "right answer" in most situations, so it really requires intuition rather than brain-burning calculation.

The second thing that really amazes me about this system is that the different factions are stunningly well-balanced and yet each requires a totally different style of play. The genius of this game is how it takes a simple system and lets all the complexity and interaction flow from the cards themselves.

If Summoner Wars has one flaw, it is simply that it's really only a 2-player game. There is a 4-player option in the rules and it simply doesn't work very well. A true minis game has a lot more ways to accommodate teams or odd numbers of players, whereas SW is simply limited by its maps and starting setups. They are a necessary evil to achieve the incredible balance of one faction against another, but it does sometimes make me wish a "battle royale" was a more practical option.

How does Plaid Hat do it?

No, I'm serious.

Look at their string of hits.

Look at their game quality.

Look at this expansion set that comes with acres of box space to fit everything in the entire SW system, custom dividers for every single deck and expansion that exists, a killer divided play mat, and a heaping of awesome new Alliance decks that add tons of fun to the game.

How does any other game company not look at Plaid Hat and say, jeez, we gotta step things up?

"Summoner Wars" was my gateway to the Real Deal in gaming and still one of my absolute favorite games/game systems. This set is a no-brainer, essential, must buy.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (July 2015)

WOW what an expansion/standalone set. I love Summoner Wars and I love playing with the new factions. So far I have only played with two (Tundra Guild and Deep Benders) but both games have been quick, tense and very fun. I feel that the Guild Dwarves are the most powerful faction, and the Tundra Orcs are my favorite faction so I had to play with them first :D. For now I can say I love the movable Ice Walls :D.

Love that now you can organize all the cards in this box AND it is very neat that each army is summarized on the army´s divider.

When I began playing Summoner Wars, the deckbuilding options were rather scarce, now there are multiple possibilities thanks to the reinforcements, second summoners and the Alliances Box.

The art continues to be regular for me (but considerable better), but this doesn’t affect the fun I have with the game. The neoprene mat is great.

On the bad side, some of the cards and separators came damaged but I think Plaid Hat is issuing replacements. Another minor dislike for me is that in at least 3 dividers there is some wrong information. (Nikuya Na from Jungle Elves summary card is missing info on the poison markers rule´s card, Mugglug is also wrong, it shows a vine wall rule´s card which is not in the Master Set. Each vine wall has the rules in the back. I forgot the other mistakes).

Bottom line, Summoner Wars: Alliances is a keeper and I always want to play it. I hope to try all the factions soon and I will continue to buy all things SW. When I play more with each faction I will comment again.

I recently bought the latest expansions for the game :D. They fit in the box without any issue but I dislike the size of the Alliances box. It is different from the previous master set and any other game I have so I cannot stack the boxes. This one is quite heavy now.

2 players (can be played with 4, but haven't tried). Asymmetrical tactical card/board game with simple dice-rolling combat mechanics. There's a deck building aspect as well, where you can build a custom deck with which to play (this aspect is enhanced by alliances as you can now mix factions).

This a great, great addition! Please don't miss this. It adds so much into the already wonderful game.

There are some interesting concepts here, but I find Alliances to be needlessly overcomplicated for the most part.
Some factions are cool, some cards are awesome to use in deckbuilding, but others have way too much text to simply explain your opponent what your unit can do.
I would recommend this one for the fans of the game, but it's not a must buy.

The base game (which is the first Master Set for me) I rate with 10.

A card driven war game played on a board.  The scale is pretty small.  A great game to play with kids.

The rules are very quick to understand.  Tactics and strategies are difficult to figure out for some of the pre-made decks included.

It's very easy for the game to snowball for a player making it boring for the other player very early on.

Summoner Wars: Alliances Master Set, a big box starter set for Summoner Wars akin to the Summoner Wars Master Set, features eight complete faction decks and can be played on its own or combined with other Summoner Wars products. All sixteen factions in the SW world are represented as each new summoner is a hybrid of two existing factions, blending the themes of the two factions and expanding deck-building possibilities.

There should be more symbols on the cards instead of all the text but it don't take that long to read either. The only other thing I don't like is that its hard to know all the special abilities of the opponents team for newcommers.

Alliances finishes out the summoner wars releases with a bang.  The added deckbuilding mechanic adds a lot to deck options.  With 40 summoners, the game will likely never get old.  On top of that, the alliances decks are very interesting and unorthadox.

PHG has hit it out of the park with this game.  The depth and variety of play is astonishing, truly one of the best games I've ever played.  It is a shame the game never took off competitively, it is a rich and rewarding game to master.

I fought off this game for a very long time.  I tried the app and it fell flat for me at first.  Reviews did not convince me.

I cannot wait to get some of the other factions and expansions to add the deck building aspect to the experience.

Combines the fiddly card synergies of games like Magic with tactical, grid-based combat. Perfect blend of strategy and luck. I haven't tried deck-building but the premade decks provide a lot of fun and variety. The theme and art are a little generic but the gameplay is outstanding.

I don't like very much the faction-mix, but these decks are very well done, with great new mechanics and strong in-built interactions. The complexity level is a little more higher. Very good artwork as always (maybe better).

The only flaw is about the Tundra Guild faction: in my opinion it is the first very weak faction in the Summoner Wars history and their design is bad. A real pity. I tweaked the Rune rules card to rebalance it (you can find my tweak in the 'Variant' section of the forum), because as they are they have very few hope to win and are not fun at all to play (I do not deckbuild and I refer to the base deck only).

For comments on the general game system, see Summoner Wars: Master Set

Yay, goodbye to my old awkward box and beaten up hard boards!

Despite initially thinking the "alliance" concept was kinda stupid, the new designs for the Summoners seem pretty great! The new factions have refined concepts and deep gameplay, continuing the trend started with the Second Summoners.

If you compare Second Summoners or these factions to the first simplistic army releases, it is super obvious that a lot was learned about how to design Summoner Wars factions. There is simply no comparison. Newer stuff wins. The games are always creative and exciting, whereas the older faction often developed into a turtling, deck-out slog.

Disappointing to see that they still haven't addressed the issue with stalemates with the original factions though; seems like a new printing "V3.0" of the rulebook would be a good time for some sort of slight rules change if there are never going to be balance changes. I don't really care for the strategy of "dilute the game's problems with expansions"

Overall, I am very impressed that the simple Summoner Wars engine can still support such flavorful and unique concepts for new armies with barely any redundancy and no power creep at all.

[hr]These races are better by far. If all of the game's 30+ races were to the caliber of the Alliance factions, then this game would easily be high in my Top 10.

We really enjoy playing this. We've got a few extra factions to change up the game play a bit more but there is plenty of content in the master set box to keep most up and comers happy. There is potential for analysis paralysis, but for the most part game play is typically in the 30-45 minute range. The art work is pretty awesome, some decks contain more gore than others. And finally the decks seem for the most part pretty balanced. There are different advantages for each faction but none seems to outweigh the other as wells as having "luck of the draw". I highly recommend this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We don't play this game a lot, but it is a blast every time we do.  It's a very, very replayable game because there are so many factions available and each has slightly different strategies.  It can be a short game or a long game depending on your faction choices and how much thought you put into it.  There can be some AP, of course, so you probably don't want to play this with someone you wouldn't play chess with.

We've added on several additional faction decks already and plan to continue adding more.  Thankfully, this box came with a huge variety to start with AND has room to store everything else we might add!  The neoprene mat is also an excellent touch and something we enjoy every time we play.

If you're looking for a head-to-head card game that plays a bit more like a war game (or chess), this is a game for you.  I prefer it over games like Magic: The Gathering and Ashes, because the added spatial mechanic makes it much more tactical.  The factions seem well-balanced right out of the box, so you also don't *have* to constantly be buying booster packs and things to try to buff up your deck.  I'd love to see this game more widely played!  With the right group of friends, Summoner Wars could easily be a weekly game night all on its own.

Thought I was checked out of Summoner Wars until this new master set came out... but how could I resist eight new armies?!

I still think that Dwarves - Cave Goblins and Phoenix Elves - Tundra Orcs are better entry points since the armies are so canonical feeling. This master set works better for longtime fans, especially since each new army is a hybrid of two existing factions.

Also love that it stores everything so far, even if the box is a bit unwieldy (though certainly less unwieldy than the old master set box).

A clever, nearly abstract chess++ game hiding inside yet another summon-magical-warriors 'tactical combat' entry. The core discard-to-power-up mechanic is brilliant, games are short, rules are *extremely* short...but it falls just short for me, for reasons I can't quite articulate.

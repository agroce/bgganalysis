I eagerly got the PnP version to try this out.  But I was disappointed.  It is nicely done but felt like nothing special, and for me the impulse mechanism was the killer.  With FtF play this may make for furious action but for a mainly solo gamer it, like ATS, just results in a very fragmented experience.

Excellent Tactical game that feels like a cross between Conflict of Heroes and Lock n' Load.  Plays very nicely, and feels perfect for the conflicts.  The addition of the 'Pocket Battle' maps was badly needed, but their arrival just increases the availability of playing this baby.

KS.  Wisest KS decision I've made.  Beautiful game; astounding value for the money.  If I get many more of this series I think my delivery guy is going to ruin his back.  Ended the very first game with a very large smile on my face.  Will be primed and ready for the Western Front volume reportedly next in line.  This is what "tactical board wargaming" is all about.

RATING: 5.5
For those who don't already own a tactical WW2 game. But to me the lack of a full solo game system makes it not interesting enough. Ambush for a GI Joe experience and Conflict of Heroes have both a fully fledged solo AI system that is much better along with more streamlined game play.
I don't think it will be interesting or different enough to those who already have one of the many tactical WW2 games on the market.

An amazing wargaming value for the money both in terms of physical production and entertaining gameplay.  WWII tactical armored warfare grognards with zealous loyalties to particular series may want to play before purchase; the rest will immediately appreciate the ease of entry, the focus on a fast tempo of action, and on the sheer fun factor this game offers.  An impressive debut for this new system.

One year late!  Almost forgot I ordered it already and about to place another order.  I should be looking to buy the game from the publisher later than in Kickstarter for the western front expansion. The edge of the box is scuffed due to weight press.  Dude, what happens to the USPS?  The other game of Band of Brother: Texas Arrow also has the same problem.

RATING: 6
Still on the fence with this one.  Easy to learn, nice components.  Rule book layout is terrible.  Many rules are absent that the designer "thought were in there".  Impulse point system can create very unbalanced scenarios if one side rolls consistently high and the other low.  Would more than likely play CoH or LnL over this.

Great value. Amazing Components. The rulebook is somewhat confused in its organization, but nothing too serious. Buy this game!

Old School Tactical provides a new take on Panzer / Squad Leader scale tactical gaming.  It's far less complex than either of those systems but preserves much of the essence of each.  While not quite a beer and pretzels game, it manages to cover terrain effects, line of sight, ranged fire, hard and soft targets, leaders, command & control, auxiliary weapons, and off-board artillery without sending you back to the rule book to look up the details of every action.  This was accomplished by teaming a very clever system with an 80% is good enough philosophy right out of the Lockheed skunk works.  A great player aid card covered with modifier lists and rule summaries helps.  This combination achieves a lot of game depth for relatively little player effort.  I'm deeply impressed.

The core of the system is the impulse based unit activation.  Command and control efficiency is modeled by how many dice you roll at the start of a turn to determine your sides' number of impulses for that turn.  Then you and your opponent trade off using an impulse to move or shoot a unit.  This gives a much smoother flow than Panzer and a constant stream of decisions for both players.  Each unit is marked moved or fired on it's first impulse and then marked used if it completes a second impulse.  All this is done just by flipping one type of marker and neatly stops you from running rampant with a few key units as can happen in a less well designed impulse system.  In general you don't have enough impulses for two activations for each unit, but there is a lot of random variation in how many impulses you get.  Sometimes you're flush and sometimes you're sorely lacking.  Mostly though, you've got almost enough impulses to do what you want.  Lots of decision pressure there.  Opportunity fire adds to this effect, and the ability to use "intensive fire" to provide opportunity fire from a used unit stops a lot of attacker gaminess while the penalties for doing so prevents it's abuse by the defender.  This is typical of the design philosophy of Old School Tactical: use one simple rule to add a fairly realistic effect and prevent runaway gaminess.

Line of sight rules are similar, simple but reasonably accurate.  Artillery drift is handled at the same level, simple but pretty much right.  The drift potential is enough to make you think twice about firing near your own troops.  Combat uses different tables for hard and soft targets.  Moreover, shooting at hard targets requires getting a hit before you can refer to the table.  Unit data cards give all you need to know about decreasing odds of hitting and of doing damage at increasing range.  The approach is much like that in Panzer, but follows the Old School Tactical 80/20 design rule: 80% as realistic with 20% as much effort.  There are also efficiency checks in the usual situations: a unit has cause to be frightened or is trying to recover from that state.  Leaders can help with that and with quite a few other things from targeting to spotting for artillery.  A little bit of flavor comes in with luck cards, one per side per game.  It's not enough to warp a game, but it does spice things up a bit.  Not a big deal one way or the other, so these cards can be ignored if they're not your thing.  They're like the chits on the Victory Roads etc games, but without the overwhelming abundance. Finally, the slightly variable number of turns mitigates against last minute dashes for victory hexes. Phew, what a lot of comments about such short rules!

The rules themselves are clear, well organized and in a nice big font.  In fact the whole game seems to assume you left your bifocals at home.  Bravo!

The materials range from good to outstanding.  On the good side you get two copies of a player aid card that covers all the tables and everything you might need to remember on two sides of a beautiful, but flimsy 8.5/11 sheet.  Outstanding are the playing pieces and map which are both works of art mounted on exceptionally thick stock.  The pieces are large and the hexes larger, but the map is huge so there is a lot of real estate to play in.  Some folks may be annoyed that the map isn't geomorphic, but I find the game's "mark out a section and play in it" approach gives enough variety for the scale of scenarios provided.  They're all fairly quick, from a couple of hours to maybe half a day.  You only really need geomorphic maps if the units move too fast (Ghost Panzer!) or you want to spend all day playing one scenario.  Given that few units survived any of my battles, more map wouldn't accomplish much.  Bottom line, I'm happy with the huge non-geomorphic map.  Oddly, there are quite a range of font sizes on the units.  I'm not sure what point that serves, but since they're all readable from a great distance it doesn't really matter.  I'm not a chad clipper, but those who are will be thrilled with the way the individually die-cut pieces pop out of the sheets.  They actually pop back in too, if you're of a mind to store the pieces in the sheets.  Overall, I'd give Old School Tactical a 10 on materials (better than any other game in my collection) if only the player aid cards were on card stock.

Bottom line: there is very little old school in Old School Tactical except the fun level.  Rather, it is a highly evolved game system for low effort, high fun, fairly high realism tactical combat on the squad / vehicle level.

imagine the best battle scenes in your favourite war movie. Now think about playing that  on a boardgame.  That's what this game feels like to me.  Allow me to give a few examples.  In one scenario it was going to be highly advantageous for me to make a dash for a particular hex.  Unfortunately my opponent had just laid down an artillery barrage.  The barrage was off target but blocked my path to the desired hex.  I decided to run the gauntlet through three hexes  (about 150 yards) of falling artillery shells and miraculously made it through unscathed.  If that's not out of a movie I must be watching the wrong ones.  In another scenario I needed a tank to advance so I could effectively flank my opponent's elite unit (Let's call them the movie stars).  He was obviously concerned about this and gave a great cheer when my tank got stuck in a hedge thus allowing his stars to avoid being slaughtered.  

The game plays quickly.  By that, I don't mean the game is over quickly.  In this case I mean that each move is quick and since it is back and forth turns you won't have long to wait before you get to move your stars or your extras again.

After playing 6 scenarios, for me this system is a 10! The rules are complete, clear and well writen. The components are top notch and the system is fantastic! It remembers me Squad leader but with a better and simpler combat system and the game is much more dynamic with the impulses. There are numerous and different interesting scenarios. This tactical system is fun and addictive!
Only one small cons, I would like to see mortars crew weapon in the next opus.
Congratulation Shayne for your great job!

Very nice components and fairly easy to learn hex and counter game.  Good set of scenarios and designer support on BGG.  If you are "moving up" from a more entry level game like Memoir 44 this might hit a sweet spot.  Of note, combat tables make figuring out damage easy which I liked; other systems with more info on the counters let you calculate things yourself.  If you have strong feelings about this there is plenty of info on BGG to help you decide between systems.

RATING: 7.5
Kickstarted.

To borrow a phrase that others have already used, this will probably be my "go to" WWII tactical system. A few (quite minor) kinks in the rules at the moment, but I think they'll get ironed out in time. Certainly no "show stoppers" thus far. 

While there's much less chaos happening than in a game like Combat Commander, the tide of the battle can turn very unexpectedly at times due to the way the impulse system works. This can add a fair bit of tension, since momentum can shift fairly quickly. 

Overall, I think the game does what it says it's trying to do, which is to deliver a fairly realistic game with a fast-playing and straightforward rule set. 

Looking forward to future installments in the series.

-edit-

A few months down the road and I I still enjoy OST. I'm less thrilled with the impulse system as time goes on, though. 

One advantage of the activation system in a game like "Fighting Formations" is that players can spend initiative to op fire whenever they need to by spending initiative (even if it puts them into a deficit). On the other hand, in OST once a player's IP is gone, the other side can walk around the map unhindered because the first player can not longer even op fire. In situations where the IP rolls come out relatively even, this isn't such a big deal. But when one side gets 5 IP and the other gets 16 (and I've found that differentials like these aren't especially uncommon, depending on how many dice are available ), it becomes problematic and encourages some gamey behavior on both sides.

poorly written and organized components, charts, rules. board graphics look great until you have to play. game piece numbers with no consistant format, difficult to read due to graphics, font colors and sizes. card format different game components. half can be fixed, but half cannot.... should have waited for the second edition.

Will almost certainly become my WWII tactical-level game of choice for the foreseeable future. Easy to play and to teach and is historical as well. This is a new system, so it is still evolving. For example, the lack of mortars (other than a luck card event) is odd since mortars are typically easy to design rules for (i.e.; launch mortar round, check for drift, roll dice for result) tactical games. However, the impulse rules are great and the way the armored rules are scaled down without being unhistorical is awesome. Looking to play many games of this in the future.

Edit: After multiple solo plays and one face-to-face match, I'm upping may rating to a 10. I've been gaming for over 40 years, and this is the best tactical-level WWII game I've played. 

Initial rating based on solo play. OST is the tactical WWII game I've been looking for. Beautiful graphics (especially the maps), a straightforward system that's simple without being simplistic, and most importantly, gameplay that is fast, exciting, and creates a strong narrative.

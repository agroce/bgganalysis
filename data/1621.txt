Picked up at Origins 2007--can't wait to give it a go!  It's basically unpunched.  [update]  Please, I want to play this game soon!  Finally got a play in at Phantom--AWESOME game!!!  I really want to play this in the campaign mode, which is unlikely, at least at this point...but that's about the only thing that's keeping me from rating it a 10.  We missed something pretty huge--the little bullet point that says "Shuffle and give each corporation 2 Doomtrooper cards" that was hidden near the grenade launcher rules in the rule book.  So we all got our Doomtrooper cards towards the end of Mission 2 (we only played one mission), which helped a lot, but by that point, the Dark Legion was leading a parade of monsters.  Knowing we'd get those at the beginning of the mission would have improved our odds incalculably!  Can't wait to play again--very, very glad I picked this one up!

Seriously cool 80's-era GW-style sci-fi dungeon crawl game. The rules for less than a full compliment of players seem pretty unbalanced, though.

A great game. While the compatibility with Fury of the Clansmen boardgame has never been used, this game is very good. Of course you need at least three other friends to play it for good, but otherwise is really really good. Too bad they never supported it!

Amazing figure game. The fact that players takes time in controlling the 'evil forces', and gain xp to their own team while doing it really works well!

I broke this game out (6/11/13) again after about 15 years.  Everything was in good condition, and a short trip through the postings here and I was able to incorporate some modifications and enjoy it again with some friends.  It still holds its value as a simple romp through dungeons blasting mutant bad guys all the while leveling and gearing up.  Good times.

This game has many layers that engage the players.  Not much downtime to speak of and each game is greatly varied with the variety of secondary missions, event cards, and equipment.  Each mission takes about one hour with experienced players and that's a huge bonus in my book.  I'm sure this will eventually move to a 9 or even as high as a 10 for me.

Haven't played, but the minis are excellent for expanding your figure collection for games like Space Hulk or Space Crusade. You could also use the player character teams as leaders for your Terminator squads. There was a time when you could purchase this game in outlest like KayBee or TRu for $10. I recently saw a shrinkwrapped copy in a game shop with a $50 price tag.

Hilariously goofy.  The miniatures are amusing and the character stereotyping  extremely heavy-handed.   It has a good dynamic for rotating the role of the "bad guy" player so that no-one has to constantly play the as "the game" (if you know what I mean).

Quick to learn and very fast to play, allowing several missions to be played in one sitting quite easily.

Plenty of the cards in the game can disrupt players plans very rapidly and severely so if that kind of randomness is going to bother you then give it a skip.  It bothers me enough to have house ruled one of the cards in particular, as it is the sort of thing that can consistently ruin a players enjoyment.

The game balance is somewhat unsophisticated, but I really like the unusualness that everyone is on the same team, but has separate scores, so everyone is running around trying to outdo each other for maximum points rather than fighting a sensible, cautious plan of attack.

I haven't played this game in about 10 years. I am anxiously awaiting the chance to break this one out again. It was a solid game when I was in high school, but we didn't play competitively like the game is meant to be played. Playing it with the competitive rules sounds like a great time to me now. Odds are good my rating will go up. (10+ plays)

Not everything about this game has aged well, but in its day the components and campaign-style play were refreshing. Even today, its not awful, but you know its a bit of nostalgia when this game gets pulled out.

If all the players are on the ball, the game can play quite quickly. It gets dull for me when there is a lot of waiting for my turn. 

I'd be attracted to playing a full campaign with the same team and the same group of players, over several sessions. I'm not sure that's going to happen, but it would be fun.

There may be more recent games that do it better or with more style, but Mutant Chronicles is still worth the time, if you have the right group. I'd be willing to play any time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Super fun game with robust mechanics!  If Dark Legion player is winning, Corporation players can band together to improve their chances of completing their missions.  If Corporation players are beating down the Dark Legion player, they can sabotage each other to have one be the ultimate winner.  Campaign style play is also an option!

RATING: 7
A nice little miniatures game where each person represents a devastating team of warriors from different corporations. It is a fun game, that only has 1 real drawback, you need 5 to play, not 4, and not 6. Only 5. But man, when you do play, this game is a lot of fun. The next thing you know, it is 5 hours later, and you still want to play "just one more mission"

A nice game with nice components. The Doom Trooper miniatures are not the most detailed, but appropriate for the game. This is a very nice game to alternate when playing dungeon crawler games because it really speeds up missions by having round based objectives. Makes players that like to sit back and wait--change their strategy.

This game is a dumbed down sci-fi dungeons and dragons.  It plays like many video games out there during the early-mid 90's.  

Once again, the problem is that the game was aimed at far too young of children.  10 year olds cannot grasp this game!  

Ofthe three "introductory hardcore games" that we were given to my family, we played this one the most.  But that isn't saying much.  No one wanted to be the dungeon master, and few of the people involved could even pull it off properly.  Most of the younger teenagers involved simply got bored and walked off mid game.

Years later we pulled it out with Heroquest and tried it out again.  We finally understood what was going on, but it couldnt save this game.  We played 3/4 of the campaign once and then tossed it.

A lesson learned from all of these "introductory" games is that they need to make them far more simple for the younger kids.  This entire generation of games failed miserably at this by attempting to make it complex enough for the older crowd, but simple enough for the younger kids.

You simply can't please everyone.  And this game proved it!

25 years after it's release, in 1993, i found my old Siege of the Citadel in the attic.
In pristine, near mint, condition and 99% complete but for the rulebook.
I haven't been this stoked in a long time. Gawd i love it!
I'm VERY thankful to that little boy, i once was, for keeping it in order.

I'ts time to buy some card sleeves and remove the old paint from the minitures and repaint them.
FYI: Totally not for sale. Sry.

RATING: 8
Very thematic game.  So much better than your typical dungeon crawl.  You are working cooperatively to complete your mission objective.  At the same time you need to keep the other players "knocked down" so that you are ahead in terms of points/kills.  This game could really shine if played campaign style.  Though I do worry a bit about an unluckly player getting knocked out in an early mission.  This would reduce his credits to the point he cannot buy any good weapons.  This would then prevent him from getting kills/points in later missions.  But until this game is tried out in a campaign, it is hard to guess how that would play out.  Ultimately, this is going to be tough for me to find time to play it the way it should be (campaign style).

This is the best (best = most fun for this type of game) system ever for a dungeoncrawl type game vs a GM. It suffers slightly from balance issues, particularly in the later missions, so it needs the GM to play for getting the best experience out of the session instead of playing to maximise his own points.
It's a shame it wasn't expanded more upon than a few extra missions and monsters + new faction in a flimsy mag.

 Underneath the veneer of this 80's trip into overproduction and dripping with theme is a solid little tactical combat game with nice miniatures, board and components. 
 It's main drawback was that it really needs 5 players to shine... but when it does...it really does!   A new edition is slated for release in 2017. So obviously it has had a lot of faithful love over the years.

I can see the brilliance of this game was way ahead of its times.  Leveling, campaign system, descent-style dice,  weapon upgrades - lots to love here. In some ways, this might be the best tactical "dungeon crawler" game yet made.  The only thing that really killed my chances of getting this played was the dependence on 5 players for best balance.

An excellent game. Theme well integrated into the rules. Nice board and bits. This should definitely be reprinted. Have been trying to trade for a copy for over a year - noo luck. Have also bid on at least 6 copies on E Bay also without luck. My current grail.

RATING: 10
Not as balanced as it should be, but this game is maddeningly fun.  I would've rated this higher in years past--and in fact, if you've never tried it, it would be an "10" from me.  Once you've exhausted the scenarios and played and played it, eventually it loses some of its luster and replay value.

UPDATE:  Again, coming back to my ratings after trying other games just makes this one shine all the brighter.  FFG---WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  Just reprint this game and save yourselves a lot of time and heartache!

UPDATE:  We've recently started a campaign of this again, and absence indeed makes the heart grow fonder...this game is really, really good!  Bumped rating back up to an 9.

With one night of gamer play & a full 10 game campaign with my son under my belt, I'm prepared to call this one of the great lost gaming treasures of the early 90's.

Oh, it's not perfect by any stretch - you need to house rule your way through a couple of problems & the scenarios are really only balanced for 3-4 teams vs the Dark Legion, but it's a blast to play & the whole semi-cooperative thing was light years ahead of it's time.

This game is tons of fun. Players work together for a common goal but there is a bit of infighting to make sure your team does the best. Use experience for better gear and dice, thats the incentive. Players take turns playing the baddies for a mission, and will be rewarded if they win. Very interesting dynamic.

This is one of my favorite games!  The player interaction is fantastic!  The pieces are very nice.  Playing a campain game with 5 players is the best.  The missions are very varied, and challenging. It's an absolute outrage that Doom and Descent are rated higher then this game.  It is superior to them in every fashion.  Cleaner, faster, more fun!

Update: Why is a game from 20 years ago still better then all the other dungeon crawls made since?  It's simple, it doesn't bog down it's core game play with useless mechanics, fiddy rules, and mountains of icons and cards.  What you get is a simple game, with some nice team tactical game play, great multiplayer, dynamics and a solid varied campaign.  

What do you need: Never less then 5 players, a couple of house rules, and a good 20 hours.  This game only really shines when played as a campaign.    

Still rather play this then Doom, Descent, Castle Ravenloft, Level 7, Gears of War, or any other "Dungeon crawl" games.

Boardgame played with miniatures where Doomtroopers enter Citadel to accomplish missions. One of the best boardgames ever on my opinion. Quick and light to play but still there's plenty of tactical decisions you have to make. You can play one short game of this or whole evening and night. Good thing in this game is that Dark Legion player is randomly determined so it doesn't matter if the mission is unbalanced in favor for any player because Dark Legion player changes all the time in campaign game and that evens it. Game is good mix of cooperation and competition. There's usually only one winner. It's also well balanced and playtested, but still there's couple unclear things in rules. Artwork and backround stories give great spirit to the game and players often get experiences of success.

Lots of fun!  Been a while since this one got played, but it is a blast.  Pretty much a clone of Space Crusade (nothing wrong with that!) with a bit more competitiveness thrown in between the co-op players.  Alien player is still just out to make tofu out of the soldiers.  If you cannot find (or have worn out) Space Crusade, this is a worthy successor.

Another &quot;lost&quot; game. Pressman and Target games put this game into Toys &#039;R&#039; Us stores all over the country to a resounding snore by consumers. In reality, this is a fine game. Cool minis, slick game play and a smattering of strategy make this a worthwhile way to spend an afternoon. Lock and Load.

Only played two player and quickly discovered it was most definitely not made as such.  Looks like the game would be a lot of fun for multiple players with some built-in screw your buddy mechanics to balance out the co-op nature of the game.  My final verdict would have to be a good game for its genre but a bit outdated by today's standards (although amazing bits for its time).

RATING: 6
Very interesting early title from Mr. Borg who also did Liar's dice very early on, one of my new fav filler games. 

Certainly far from Eurogaming here and as such always a nice welcomed change of pace for me. This should appeal to Gamers who like D & D or DOA my all-time fav. Basically you are running around a 'dungeon/map' with lots of cool stuff available to purchase for 'points' with the better items costing more of course. Each character in the game has so many points available so no one gets too powerful before someone else, nice balancing effect. This all makes for a nice fun tactical skirmish game but as such is pretty light on strategy. 

Where this gets interesting is how the game actually plays out, someone gets to play 'the bad guy' while everyone else gangs up against him making it semi-co-op. You could also have an all-out slug fest too and the system is open enough for tweaking and playing different campaigns. Another great feature is how your points increase as you increase levels so you are upgrading along the way which means playing the same characters over several sessions. Nice variable powers and weapons and excellent variety here.  A very clean design considering the genre, besides the C & C system games this is probably one of his best to date.

Played the hell out of this back in the day.  Easy to get into, quick to play.  Scales up well, whether you have three or five at the table.  Basic mechanics are easily picked up and there are a couple different ways to customize your characters.  Having each player control two characters (one optimized for melee, the other for fire combat) allows for some tactical flexibility in how players approach the game, something that is lost in similar designs where each player has only a single figure.

It´s one of those games, like Heroquest, that I found too kiddie-like, when they came out, in my pretentious early 20s, (I played "REAL" roleplaying games, and "SERIOUS" miniature games!) but want to own and play now that I´m approaching my more laid-back 40s...

Haven´t played yet, but having read through the rules and scenarios, it looks promising! All the good elements of a game like DooM, but more smooth, and with a MUCH shorter playing time!

I was really hoping this was going to be the game to end all games for me. Sadly that wasn't the case. It's a good game, and has held up well over the years, but there still seems to be something missing, or not quite there.  The downtime between turns can be longish, and the rules are just not clear at certain points. The boards function great, but their graphic design is just awful.  The minis are really cool, but having much different colors between the Doomtroopers, and the Dark Legion forces would have been more helpful. I really like the rotating GM aspect to the game, and I think it is balanced really well between the Doomtrooper players, and the Legion player.  The uniqueness of the various Doomtroopers is also quite good, although the Mishima player seems a little underpowered.  Combat is simple, and is done quite well in the system.  Maybe more plays, and further missions will improve the score, but right now I am hoping that Space Crusade turns out to be all the things that I was hoping MC:SoC was going to be.

I've never gotten a chance to play this in true campaign style, but the few games I have played were enjoyable. I like the semi-cooperative element -- needing to help each other, but also wanting to win; this really reinforces the theme of the game and its milieu.

Add in killer minis and simple but sound mechanics, and this is just a neat game overall. The only real downside I spotted was that getting stuck as the baddies early on seemed to be a major disadvantage -- it set you back quite a bit in terms of overall progress.

Finally acquired a near-mint copy at BGG.CON 2009. And then promptly stepped on the corner of the box. *^*%(*^!

This does not work as a two-player game. It does work as a multiplayer game, with one person as the overlord or all players taking a turn as the overlord.

It's not a great game, I don't think. But it is fun, and I enjoyed it. I played the overlord for a couple scenarios, but then our campaign fell apart, so I never got to play as a trooper.

It's very simple, with nothing terribly innovative. But it's a classic bit of AmeriTrash with terrific theme, dice, a cheesy citadel stand-up that just gets in the way, cool minis and lots of violence.

Take it for what it is.

Extremely bloody, which is fun. Kind of interesting tactics, although the fact that there are only really two actions worth doing most of the time and sometimes only one (shoot and run) makes the gold orders "worth" a lot less than the silver ones. Streamlined mechanics for shooting/damage also really good. Big downside is the end game; you end up having much more order tokens than you know what to do with.

Game is complete and in overall excellent condition.

Flaws as follows:

Box top has two broken seams.

Classic Ameritrash shoot 'em up. 
Let's see how many monsters we can shoot - because you will have a lot of targets.

The movement/combat is simple - yes some of the weapons are unbalanced - just make sure you get them first.

Like the quasi-cooperative element - with the don't get in my way backstab. The campaign element which allows you to upgrade your characters, adds to the theme.

A good diversion when you want to blow somethign up

RATING: 6.5
Update March 2012: Downgrade from 7 to 6.5. One scenario is the perfect length for this game. However, I think you're supposed to play one scenario per player so that each player has a chance to be the "dungeon master" or the Legion. That is *way* too long. Two scenarios is too long for this game. Despite the incredibly simply rules, there's still a lot of downtime.

Good points though: There are a lot of reasons *not* to work together as a team against the Legion. Although you, as a team, have a common objective, the goal of the game is to make points. Players have special one-use cards to fuck over team mates (or to improve your situation, your choice). In addition, players can make tactical decisions such as focusing on the main objective rather than helping other team members defeat enemies.

2010-08-19: I don't have much of a preference for dungeon crawlers, but what I especially like about Mutant Chronicles is the minimal amount of chrome added to the game. Consequently, it's very easy to pick up and play -- there is no referring to the rulebook for exceptions and rarely used rules.

One of my classic! Got this game when I was really young and it's the only one that survived my teenage years. I still play once in a while after 15 years and still have fun with it. It's one of those few games where the players forms a team but compete against each other at the same time... makes for really funny situations!

My brother had this game when when we were kids. Both of us spent who knows how much time trying to figure out how to play it & never did get it playing "right".

This game had a lot of things going for it: a cool theme, lots of sweet little minis, and a nice board with a 3-D-esque citadel in the middle. Okay, the citadel was a cardboard frame, but looked quite nice & didn't cut off a majority of the board view. 

Of course, this was before BGG. We were lured back to it by the minis several times in the proceeding years & it put up a hell of a fight against us learning it. Ultimately, the game won & we pretty much abandoned it.

Rating may be inflated due to hazy nostalgic childhood memories, but I fondly recall when my friends and I each snagged a copy from KB Toys for $5.  Unbelievable components for the price and the time, and the cooperative-yet-competitive nature of the game made it a ton of fun as you tracked your team's progress and gear.

Can't recall much about the actual gameplay, though, so maybe it's only a good 'gateway game' for the younger or newer gamer.  Would love to find a copy and give it another go.

You shoot undead demonic terrors... Or blow them up....  Or set them on fire....  What more could you possibly want?!?!?  Love the game - Relatively simple rules, great game with kids or kid like adults ;-), but there's still enough tactical decision making involved to keep it interesting.  Only down side is you realy need 5 players for a good game.

--Jun2008-- Excellently atmospheric mini game that plays like a (early) relative of _Doom_ and _Descent_.  This one, though, is significantly more accessible for a first-time player - and that while retaining a nontrivial set of tactical decisions.  Fun stuff!

I never got this played, but did study it a little on my own. It would've been good fun for a set group that would play this through the whole campaign over a few sessions. And it should be a group of five. It doesn't look like I'll get to enjoy such a luxury, at least not of players who'd like this type of game. The game employs some things I like: hit/no-hit dice (though with a little clunky system - e.g. Doomtroopers roll if they're getting two or more hits to maybe block two instead of one), equipment with simple statistics (range max rule could've been worked into stats), hidden goals, simple movement. It taught me that chrome can get in the way - the cardboard walls of the citadel make it hard to see.

7.13.11 - (1st 3 missions) enjoyed the game... I think I'll like subsequent plays better now that I understand a little more about what's important and what's not. Working together is more important than I first thought. Can't say that I liked this better than Space Hulk, Claustrophobia, or HeroScape but I'm certainly hoping to play it some more. 

Pros: Peg boards are a great idea. Like having two heroes with different fighting styles. Weapon and equipment upgrades are a lot of fun. I like the rotating DM. 

Cons: Don't care for the quality of the minis though it's far from a game breaker. Citadel walls are way over the top and were quickly discarded.

One of my all-time favorite games.  It has a little bit of everything - luck, equipment, experience, co-op (yet at the same time competitive) play, a variety of missions, and even some limited role-playing.

Please email me for details.

Guys with swords, guys with guns, and guys with guns AND swords! Pretty revolutionary for its time. The semi-coop where you want to outperform your partners but not so much that you all lose to the bad guy is awesome

Like most dungeon crawlers it might leave you wanting there to be more strategy and tactics but still feel amazingly fun to play anyway.

Nice, simple, scenario-based semi-cooperative dungeon crawl type of game. Players must cooperate to get through the scenarios, but there's (eventually) just one winner.

But I prefer Descent, with all the cool extra stuff!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
(playing a campaign with Greg's home-modified version)

In the campaign game, will play a series of maps where players in turn will play the Dark Forces. Each map has a different layout, with entry points for players and Dark Legion forces, a different set of defense force cards, and different win conditions. Players start each scenario buy equipping their units (weapons, defense, mods). The DM randomly spreads out the defense force cards. Players each get 2 random bonus effect cards.

Each player plays a corporation with unique powers (extra movement, defense, etc.). Each round, in random order, players take a turn; then the DM goes. Each of the players' 2 units takes 2 actions: move up to 3 steps, melee attack, ranged attack. If they move into a new map tile, the DM reveals the reinforcement card and places those units on that tile. After all players move, the DM reveals an event card, then moves all his pieces the same way.

Attacks: roll dice (different colors, based on your level and the weapon used) looking for hits; target may have armor and/or get defense roll to cancel (some) attacks. 

Players killing Dark Forces earn them promotion points, used between scenarios to rank up (better attack/defense dice, more credits to get equipment). At end of scenario (set number of rounds, or if player objective is accomplished) the DM earns credits/promotion points based on scenario criteria (bonuses for killing player units).

At the end of the campaign, the player with the most promotion points wins!

Early and innovative dungeon crawl game designed to be played in a campaign mode.  It has two flaws: first, it is really designed to be played with five and only five committed players.  Second, some of the scenarios are a bit screwy.  However, the game is not widely known, but it was incredibly innovative and massively ripped off.  If you get a chance to play it, bear in mind, that a lot of familiar mechanisms are appearing here for the first time.  Its very fun and gets somethings incredibly right (notably leveling and equipment).  It holds up enough to be well worth playing.

A nice, fast paced sci-fi skirmish game.  Serious snowball effect in campaign games - it gets progressively harder for a player who suffers setbacks to keep up.  Still, its a lot of fun and has a great variety of missions and weapons.

House rules:
* Capitol gains +2 Cards rather than +1.
* The Deathlockdrum has a burst effect, like the grenade launcher.
* You can move before or after making an attack with the Punisher Combo or the Gehenna Puker.

Concept wise, this was probably top of the heap in 1993. Now, I don't think it held up. This is a team (2 minis) level combat game. Players work together in a mission against one bad guy (the role of bad guy rotates). After the mission, experience and $$ can be used to power up your team for the next mission and so forth. This was probably the inspiration for Doom in many ways.

Played once at the CanGames 2005 (see http://www.cangames.ca/). At this event I learned that every game deserves at least one playing. I had already seen this box elsewhere and always thought that this was a game from which I would want to stay far far away; however, upon playing it, it showed itself to be much better than I thought. I'm not saying it's a great game, but it's much better than the box looked to be.

Man, I've had SO MANY awesome nights playing this game with my parents as a kid and my cousins as a teen. The rules are a little janky, and some missions really punish the Legion player - but when you're not old enough to be aware of balance issues, the miniatures and gear in this game make for pretty much the coolest experience ever. 

No game will ever occupy the same place in my heart at Siege of the Citadel.

For its time and its competition (in terms of game style and genre), Siege of the Citadel has few peers. It is an excellent value, even by today's standards. Siege of the Citadel features incredible production quality, simple rules, fast gameplay and furious action. It's a great blend of RPG and tactical elements to appeal to a wide range of people. Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel is an amazing game design and production feat. It is and will always be one of my All-Time Favorites. I still love playing Siege of the Citadel. I love it so much I've tracked down 4 copies just to have more boards and bits.

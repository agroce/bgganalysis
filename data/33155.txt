You know, it's just a solid game.  

*There's immediate access to whoever is playing it.  So even if it's your first time playing the game, you know most of what you need to know to win.
*There's a sense of being able to plan ahead, and if you're looking closely enough---make some offensive plays.
*There's no fighting with the board for things that will and won't work.  Every tile works, it's just that some work better.

A light game that has most all the straightforward elements of strategy and tactics that seats 5, I can't think of many better games, actually.

EDIT:  For all the immediate access I give this game credit for, if you're new to the table/game, you're going to get SOAKED so bad by people that have played this even just once.  Which wouldn't be a terrible thing if it were a game where you kind of knew it was coming.  However, most people see, "Simple game about gophers, I should get this." so when the soaking happens, it's double insulting/painful.

One playing with two players. My rating might go up because it felt like it played better with more people. Still, I don't like that it is practically impossible top see any other player's progress while playing, except for the gophers the have.

this is a cute little tug of war type game, that would be fun with families but has a really strong "take that" feel because there aren't enough gophers to go around! My wife wasn't too keen on it, but I thought it was alright!

Played two-player and really felt the scoring rounds came to thick and fast - there wasn't enough of a chance for one player to try and make some ground between scoring rounds.  With more spaces on the way to town the game may feel more of a battle.

RATING: 6
A nice filler-type game of drafting tiles to build tunnels, trying to not have the shortest tunnel of any given color.  The real catch here is that sometimes you'll want to complete a tunnel to get out of last place in a color before that color is scored (the scoring schedule is always visible, so you can see what colors will be scored and when throughout the game).  However, completing a tunnel means you have a very long process to complete an even longer one should you ever find yourself in last place in that color again!

So, in the end, it's a pretty neat game of timing, and trading off short term vs. long term benefits.  Neat decisions, and still simple enough for anyone to play.

RATING: 5.5
First play was solo, using 3 players, to learn the game.  It wasn't that great, but I knew it was because I was doing the super "thinky" part of the tunnel building, in triplicate, which was not that fun.  Second play w/ 2 other human opponents was better, as I was only thinking about MY tunnels/burrows/warrens.  Still, this tops out at 6.5

RATING: 8
Fun tile-laying game reminiscent of Tsuro (which my husband enjoys, therefore he likes this game - hooray!).  My kids weren't so enamored the first play through, though, since they didn't quite get the "plan ahead for longer burrows" -- this caused them to get quite upset when their gophers were stolen.  I think the second play will go better now that they've seen this (well, I hope so, anyway).
I really enjoyed this game with the tension of trying to plan ahead based on the tourist schedule while making sure you don't get wiped out early with a fast bus schedule.  Looking forward to more plays.

Tile laying game that's all about making the longest burrows in 3 different types.  Timing is key.  There's a little bit of king-making that can happen, but not as much as some others seemed to indicate.

A relatively non-descript tile laying, route building game.  The game suffers from a severe Kingmaking defect - it is often up the player to decided from which player to steal gophers from when there are several other players tied for the fewest in that color.  It feels as though the potential Kingmaking outweighs any strategy.  Pass.

This game should be a lot more fun than it is.  It is very competitive and some children do not do well.  I joke with them that the game has too many frowny faces in it (icons that represent missed tourist expectations).  So we bring it out when we want to build sportsmanship and character. :)

Silly, stupid fun. Kind of a mix between Saboteurs and Inca Gold and Whack-a-Mole. A lot of cut-throat action as players try to build the longest tunnels to grab and keep three coveted gophers. When the tour bus arrives every several turns, players who don't have the gopher(s) the tourists want to see get penalized. As the game progresses, the penalties increase, so it is a desperate race to maintain their respective compliment of gophers to please the gopher-razzi crowd. Not bad for a 45 minute game, which seems a bit more involved than a filler, but once in an evening is enough for this kind of silliness.

A simple game about raising groundhogs.  The theme is superb.  Players build burrows to lure the groundhogs away from other players.  When tourists come, those missing certain colors of groundhogs will get complaints.  The game is a simple filler, and it was enjoyable.  There is enough strategy to keep it interesting.

RATING: 7.5
You build longer burrows to steal gophers from other players. Many tiles move the score tracking bus and it reaches a scoring spot every other move. Tracking the scoring with the bus can be a little bit of a pain. I think the constant conflict with the other players to steal the gophers might annoy some players. This is one of the more interesting of the path building games, so overall I enjoyed it.

This is good family game that plays in 30 - 45 minutes.  It is very easy to learn and teach, a plus for this type of game. However, the rules are ambiguous in the case where one player has 2 of the longest burrows of a particular type. Does she attract 2 gophers of the same color?  We play that the player does.  If so, this necessarily means that 2 other players will not have a gopher of that color. How do you divvy up complaints in that case, especially if the players without the gophers have burrows that are the same length? It's a good, light, family game, but the rules need more clarification.

Just played for the first time with the boys and this went over pretty well. After a brief intro about gopher gulch and the crazy colored gophers the kids were more than excited to try the game out. I did have to help my 4 year old a little but my 6 year old caught on quickly.  Also shortened the playtime in half which worked great with their short attention spans.  Great components and pretty simple gameplay though I think I am going to replace the cardboard bus with a matchbox bus.  My 4 year olds favorite part was driving the tour bus by all of the gopher ranches and making his gophers eat the food on the tiles.

Impulse buy armed with no more info than a read of the box (atypical for me).  It was inexpensive and looked like one I could play with the family.

Played with the family. Simple rules, fairly short, but quite a bit of take-that (stealing other players' gophers).  Not sure yet how this will go with my family.  Need another play to asses.

The theme of Burrows is that you are a gopher rancher and tourists visit your ranch and if they don't see the gophers of their choice, you get complaints. At the end of the game, the rancher with the lowest number of complaints wins! 

Burrows is a quick but intense game of building - what else - burrows. Whoever has the longest burrow of a certain color gets the corresponding gopher. Gophers are fewer than the number of players, so invariably every time tourists stop by, someone is sure to get one or more complaints. Player interaction is indirect in the sense that your burrows do not intersect those of others, but the tiles your competition takes from the draw pool determine your options.

Overall, a fun enough game. Can be a nice gateway or filler game. However, even playing 4 player requires somewhat more than the average amount of table space because of the ever growing size of burrows.

This is not a bad game at all.  It reminds me of a rummy game like Crazy Chicken with a spatial aspect.  The game has a nice take-that mechanism and pressure in the form of one player losing in the many scoring rounds in the game.  A well designed game from a new designer that probably deserved a little more recognition. Not a kid's game either.

Making burrows is pleasing, but the game has several elements that need improvement to make it really shine:

(1) scores get more static as the game goes on, so the endgame is rarely tense and usually just mathy.  The longer burrows are, the harder it is to make a new one that is longer, so the less anything changes.  There should be more winding connection tiles, and fewer dead ends, in the tile stack so that there is more possibility for creating long paths late in the game.
(2) a single weak player ruins the game for everyone else.  Since each scoring round is just biggest loser, one weak player can take all the badness, and the game stops functioning.  The other players cease to be able to complete with each other, and scores stop changing.
(3) There is too much math for a pleasing spatial game.  You spend a lot of time counting up burrow lengths.  With computer support, this issue would vanish...and you would find out that the game is just a thinly disguised area-majority context with all the issues that arise with that in multi-player situations.

I quite liked this. Tile laying to produce ever-longer routes with matching colour ends. Every few turns, there's a reckoning where the single player with the shortest route in a specific colour takes some penalty points. Each turn you need to be thinking about completing routes, and developing longer routes for future claims. Can be a little tricky to see other player’s current route lengths - I'd have preferred a 3-track scoring board with markers for each player rather than placing colour markers on players tiles and requiring everyone to repeatedly count lengths.

Oh, and it's about gopher farming and the colour-preferences of visiting coach parties.

Burrows is a short tile-placement game where players attempt to outdo each other in building longer and longer burrows. There are three types of burrows and the goal is to ensure that all three of your burrows is just slightly longer than your next neighbor such that you do not accrue penalty points during each scoring round. The game is acceptable with no major design issues I can see, but very forgettable. One of those games that you can play once or twice and move on. I find other track building games such as Indigo or even Aqua Romana to be more compelling.

Fairly simple tile laying game where you lose points if you have the shortest burrow of a color each time it is scored.

A nasty little tile-laying game that has obvious influences from Carcasonne, though it's much better.  It's even simpler, but the simple majority gameplay and the more stripped down placement mechanics make it more appealing.  The theme here (digging holes for displaying gophers to tourists?) is even thinner than the city-building theme from Carc, but at least it's idiocyncratic.  Recommended as a closer or for groups looking for something light and fast.

Picked this up just because it looked interesting.  The theme is a bit wacky, but the gameplay is solid.  Players select tiles trying to build the logest tunnels to steal gophers.  Scoring is negative...  there is always one player without a certain kind of gopher, and that player gets demerits.  The player with the fewest demerits wins.  The result is playing less to be first, and more just not to be last.

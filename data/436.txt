"Wizard" with a board. I liked it a bit because I played a game with basic playing cards (pirate bridge) when I was a kid that it's mechanism it is based on. It was loads of fun as we marked our cheeks with soot when we were wrong. Ahh, memories. It doesn't live up to it though.

Two plays (5-p).

I'm happy this finally hit the table...played it back to back with some friends who are new to gaming, and it went over very well (they're the ones who suggested we play back to back). There was enough familiarity to them (trick-taking) to make it non-threatening, but the new stuff (board, pieces, varying hand size) caught their interest. I enjoyed it a lot, too!

Card trick pulling game that adds a board to move based on how accurate you were in predicting how many tricks you'd pull. If you are spot on you move more spaces. Towards the end your inaccuracies could knock you off the waterfall and land you at the beginning of the board needing to gain ground to have a chance.

When I first received this game, it looked like all it would be good for was teaching our daughter about trick taking and trumping games in a simple way, with a bit of extra fun in the race element.  Have now had 7 plays over 1 6 month period and have had to raise my opinion, and rating.  It really is an interesting game...we have played from 3 to 6 players and all have been tense and fun.  We have added one small house rule....we start with each player having 1 card and moving up rather than 8 and moving down.  The reasoning here is purely that it is easier for new players to understand the trick taking/trumping concept when they have fewer cards in their hand.  With experienced players we would start with 8.  While this is not a game that we play every week, it is one that will hit the table regularly.  Since we first introduced it to our club, 2 others have also purchased it....this shows how well it has been received.

I'd rate it higher, but sometimes, it takes too long for what it is.  If you're at all inclined toward games like Rage and Wizard, I think this is a pretty cool variant in terms of integrating a race into a trick-taking game.  You need more players, though, to take advantage of the blocking possibilities, which in turn adds some length to the game.  It isn't a perfect game, but it's a nice twist to a trick-taking collection.

I don't generally enjoy card games as much as board games. Here, the card game is really pretty basic trick-taking, but the canoe race elements add enough to make the game enjoyable to me.

I'd like to play more often, but probably won't bother to look for a copy (especially since there are a couple locally).  Its a quick-playing game with fairly simple rules. Bonus that it scales to 6p.

Played once and really enjoyed it. Have played with only 3 players. 2 adults and a 7 year old. The 7 year old did just fine and in fact won. The 10 and up age range is ridiculous. Very fun really. Trick taking card games are generally boring, but adding the racing element makes it pretty enjoyable. The board is pretty cheaply made, but the cards are nice quality and I like the little wooden canoes.

I like trick taking games and I like racing games, but this is a bad combination.
It's basically a trick taking game to determine how far you can move based on how close you come to your bid. To me, it felt like the race was just a scorekeeping devise for the Spades-like game.

Card Action
Trick-taking game in which players try to predict exactly how many tricks they will take. The number of cards in a hand increases and then decreases in size. Combining a simple trick-taking game with a racing board game makes the whole thing quite fun.A correct prediction gives your marker movement points around a scoring track depicted on a river in a canyon, whose main feature of interest is a section of "rapids" near the finish line where your marker will be "caught in the current" and sent back a few spaces if you go too many hands without a correct prediction.

Trick taking card game where the number of tricks per hand reduces from eight to one, and then back up to eight again. Players must bid on how many tricks they think they are going to take. After each hand, players earn movement points, 1 per trick taken with a bonus if they matched their bid. The movement is spent on navigating a canoe around a Canyon to the finish line! On the whole, the game works nicely.

This game looks like it should be a lot more fun than it really is.  As a pure trick-taking game, it's very good - a bit mundane, but if you like trick-takers, you'll enjoy it.  But the racing canoes, and especially the rapids at the end, undercut any kind of good card play.  Yes, the rapids force you to be more precise with your bids, but the penalty for failing is so brutal that it can easily sway who wins the game, making everything that came before it pointless.

The river race adds to the simple trick-taking game, but the contest really kicks in when you reach the rapids. Fail to make your predicted tricks, and you drift over the waterfall. Plus, the hand size starts at 8, goes down to 1, then up to 8 again. Nice game, nice timing, good fun.

My wife's family plays a card game they call Estimation or Prediction.  It's basically the same mechanic as in this game, Canyon.  The difference is that in this game it pays to predict higher and achieve it.  Also if you predict 0, it generally pays to still try and win tricks.  The trouble with this game is the bottleneck of the canyon can be frustrating.  Turn order largely affects whether you will be able to get through at certain points.  Sometimes you feel like you have less control than you'd like.  I'm willing to try again with the Grand Canyon expansion and see how it affects my enjoyment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Played 1 time. I think they key for trick-taking games (and this is one of those) is that the entire deck must be used so people have a solid idea of how many tricks they can take. Canyon doesn't allow for this, and seems to reward good hands too much (since good hands are already worth points anyways.) Not a fan.

[Original comment] This is a fun game. However, we did not care for the original rules regarding movement of the canoes. We have modified the rules considerably and find it much more enjoyable now.

May 2009 -- We still find this game fun, with our modified movement rules.

October 2011-- We only play this rarely, but we have fun when we do get it out. I can play it whenever someone wants to do so.

My favorite trick taking game. Only played with 3. Quick and tense fun. Before playing, I thought that the tricks with 1 or 2 cards wouldn't be any fun, but they really added to the (fun) stress of the round. The waterfall makes the end game dramatic, and gives everyone a 'catchup' possibility. Very easy to learn, and quick to play.

I consider myself a fan of trick-taking games, and this one was a bit of a disappointment. I didn't care for the different hand sizes, and the board movement was not as exciting as I hoped it would be. Those are the two major selling points for the game, and neither really appealed to me, so... Not bad, but I'll probably choose something else more often than not.

This is a fun little race game, where your canoes act as a "score" track for what is basically the card game "Oh Hell!".  It is a fun implementation of the trick taking game, and adds a little theme.  There are also "character" cards that can give you rule bending abilities, and essentially 5 suits.

Canyon is a little too long for what it is.  As well, at three players, this is not good.  There's just so much more to it with more people.  I would never play this with four or less.  However, even at 5 or 6 players, it's just not much going to it.  I like how each round there are different numbers of cards dealt out.  However, there are rounds where just one card is dealt...one.  I don't know.  I just didn't really care for it.  I wouldn't turn it down, but we better have at least 5 when we play it.

This was a surprisingly fun game. I always assumed that this was some awful old game, but now I wonder why no one ever tried developing this idea further, as it is full of promise.

I really enjoy the artwork and theme of the game. The board is attractive and the bid cards are very amusing. 

I have a few critiques as well. First, the game is a little too long, and tends to reward better hands, as the bonus is higher for taking more tricks. And even if you miss your bid, taking a lot of tricks will get you moving. Secondly, I'm not a big fan of the secret bids. I believe there's a lot of room for bluffing and other fun elements in the bid phase. Adjusting your bid based on someone else would make for an interesting choice, rather than just a blind guess.

I've played the original trick-taking game (with or without couple of different variants) a lot which is used in Canyon. The board doesn't give any kind of boost to the game and I also prefer the original deck of cards.

RATING: 3
Adds a board and a few tweaks to a game that I grew up calling "Up and Down the River".  In the final stages of the game when your canoes are in the rapids, you only move forward if you take exactly the number of tricks you bid and you only get the bonus according to how many tricks you took so the end game can be slow.  I'm thinking this game might be best with 5-6 but it will be really a chaotic card game either way, particularly when you get down to 1-3 card hands where you are basically hedging your bets.

I feel this is a good family game however I am slightly aggrieved at the bonus system.  In one turn I predict 0 and make sure I lose every hand (this maybe easier than winning but I played the round well) getting a movement of 1.  Next hand I predict 3 and win 6 playing badly but I get a movement of 6.  Is this correct?  If I had played badly each round I might of won or got to the rapids first.  I am sure it was heavily playtested so my suggestion probably lacks merit but wouldnt a bonus based on how close to range from your prediction be better.  Probably not.

I like most trick-taking games, especially the ones that add a twist without getting too crazy. Canyon does this, combining an Oh Hell/Wizards type of variable-deal bidding mechanism with a two dimensional scoring track. The latter might be a little more than is necessary, but it adds some real theme and appeal to the game, which is light & fun. (The expansion Grand Canyon is ok, but becomes too much of a good thing at best. I'm not real fond of special powers.)

The first game we played, we got into a situation where the leader got herself into a chicane, then overbid for everything.  Can't remember the exact position, but it was impossible to overtake her, and the game collapsed.

I don't like trick-taking games but happen to like this one because it's more than just another trick-taking game. It's a racing game which uses the trick-taking mechanism as its engine. The part near the waterfall is especially fun. It can be played by 3 or 4 persons but with more players improves significantly.

A rather pointless and chaotic race game bolted onto a conventional trick-taking/bidding card game.  The race game offers no interesting decisions -- it merely adds randomness to the outcome of the card game.  The card game itself is solid, but it's nothing we haven't seen hundreds of times before.

You can have more fun with less frustration just by playing bid whist, wizard, etc. rather than bothering with this.  Not a good design.

Since we have tons of other trick taking games and its variation, why another vanilla trick taking game? I think it's the game board : we all know that this is a trick taking game, and the racing is just a disguised score board. But still, the racing aspect is what makes this game interesting.

Oh Hell themed with a scoring track. There's more luck, caused by the extra suit and the scoring track interactions, for those who think Oh Hell needs more luck. It's also completely unfairly weighted towards players who are lucky enough to get trumps in their hand because every trick counts as a score, especially in the bigger sized hands. It generally only comes out late at night when we're desparate for one more game for 5 or 6 players. You can get more fun out of the game by adjusting the movement rules to your own tastes (eg ignore blocking and allow piggyback rides if you've landed on someone else and so moving along when they score, and/or move in race order, and/or modify the bonus awards to a straight +2 regardless of how many tricks declared, or even roll a d6*0.5 to determine the bonus each round for each size declaration before declarations are done).

I [b]love[/b] trick-taking cardgames and collect them. I actually bought this as a collector and not as a gamer, as this basically is [b]Wizard[/b] but with a scoring board with a pasted on theme. Then when I played it for the first time I realized that the scoring board actually brings loads of tactical options to the game I started to appreciate it as a trick-taking game in it's own right. Now it's one of the games we play more often and the number one game to lure other people in to the trick-taking genre.

I can't think of a better intro to the trick-taking genre (especially for young families) than this one. I like the fact there is no negative scoring, only blocking or going back to the cave if you misjudge your bid in the waterfall section, instilling essential hope for trailing players. Best with 4 to hopefully disperse smaller movement, and we skip the shaded rounds to speed up play. Playing with more than 4 makes the game overstay its welcome, and the expansion Grand Canyon may be a better option.

RATING: 2
Another Oh Hell variant that was originally published by 3M (under a different name). It is much more forgiving than a standard game(of Oh Hell) as there is no penalty for failing to bid the correct number of tricks. As an introduction to trick taking games this is acceptable but for anyone else this eliminates the point of playing. The scoring system is, at best, very poor. Often a player that bid incorrectly will score more points than a player who bid correctly. (Player A bids 1 and takes six tricks, player B bids 2 and takes 2 tricks. Player A scores 6 points and player B scores only 4!) Finally, the method for recording scores is to move canoes around the board which can, because of the design, prevent players from scoring the points earned. *** What the hell is this doing in a trick taking game? *** Very disappointing game. Canyon - a true trick taking turd.

Great game. Language free, so easy to teach to anyone who knows how to follow suit and what a trump is. The different deck (5 suits each of values 1-10) makes calculating probabilities easier, but provides a nice change from normal decks. And there is a reasonable amount of strategy in bidding and racing the canoes.
Nice board, and quality cards mean it replays well without deteriorating. 
This is very popular with my games group.

It's Oh Hell on a board.  If you have friends who sneer at a deck of regular cards but go gaga for Carcassonne, then this is just the ticket.  The board play both giveth and taketh away, but does save you hunting for pen and paper to keep score! The race-game scoring system seems to have the usual race-game effect that the leader is at an advantage - which is probably not a good thing.

RATING: 7.5
Canyon uses a trick-taking game in which players try to predict exactly how many tricks they will take. The number of cards in a hand increases and then decreases in size. A correct prediction gives your marker movement points around a scoring track depicted on a river in a canyon, whose main feature of interest is a section of "rapids" near the finish line where your marker will be "caught in the current" and sent back a few spaces if you go too many hands without a correct prediction.

Very clever basic trick taking card game my family loves and would recommend it for anyone!

Confesso que criei grande expectativa acerca deste clássico, mas que apanhei uma considerável desilusão... Uma corrida jogada ao ritmo da "Sueca", onde os jogadores fazem apostas sobre o número de vazas a concretizar (pois, isso mesmo, "Wizard" style!), para depois moverem as suas canoas. Joga-se, mas mesmo para um recomendado SdJ 98, tinha obrigação de ser melhor!

I haven't played a set collecting game (i.e. rook, hearts) in a very long time but this game was a nice change of pace.  Uses set collecting which uses a boat race to symbolize the scoring track except there is blocking and you get penalized for not bidding correctly on your trick taking toward the end so there is a little bit of a catch up mechanism.  Good solid  game if you are looking for a change of pace trick taking game.

This is a terrific trick-taking game.  It's a little bit of scaffolding put on Up and Down the River, but the extra little bit makes it great fun.

RATING: 5
Canyon is a trick taking game in which you score a bonus for taking exactly the number of tricks you predict. It is themed as a race around a set of rapids and there are some nice touches (the number of cards each player takes goes up and down each round, the waterfall at the end acts as a catch-up mechanism, players move in order from the dealer and can block each other. The downsides are that because only a part of the deck is used on each hand its quite difficult to predict likely tricks and thus quite random; the game takes a little too long for its weight; and there is very little catch-up mechanism so players can be out of the game fairly early. Over-all its enjoyable but its a sign of how much gaming has moved on in the last decade that you cannot even imagine this game being in contention for a prize today.

I bought this out of a bargain bin for extremely cheap, and didn't enjoy my first playing of it. At the time I thought it blended in with all the other trick taking games I've played with nothing really unique to differentiate it; the board seemed like a gimmick more than anything. 

After playing this a couple more times recently, the board has proven to be more of an annoyance than anything. Blocking seems arbitrary, and can last indefinitely. The rapids/waterfalls at the end can cause the game to last forever. The card game itself seems solid, and guessing how many tricks you'll take is the highlight of the game. Overall, it's just an OK game with some major annoyances via the scoring track board.

Canyon -- Does the board really add anything to this otherwise ordinary trick-taking game? For me it does. The board is quite attractive, but it's not simply a glorified scorepad. It provides a thematic way to vary short-term goals on your way to the long-term goal. The Grand Canyon expansion adds some fun elements as well; especially if the obstacles are initially placed such that early goals are as much about navigation as they are about maximizing scoring.

I like trick-taking games and Oh Hell, but I didn't like this one.

Some problems I had with it:
-There is little reason not to be completely agressive with taking tricks in the first phase regardless of your bid.
-Bidding low in the final waterfall stage seems to be the best strategy, slowing down the game.
-Having your canoe completely blocked is REALLY annoying.

All in all, I'd much rather be playing standard Oh Hell.

This is basically 'Oh, Hell!' + a racing game, and the spatial element whereby you can out-manouever and cut your opponents off improves the game imho.

The theme is awkwardly charming.  Or maybe it's charmingly awkward, I'm not sure; but, either way, it puts smile on my face when I play with my kids.  And while they'll play Canyon, none is interested in the boardless card game.

Just played it for the first time.  We played the base game without any of the "Grand Canyon" expansion.  I had heard that it was a trick taking game, and it was interesting to see that in action.  I do feel the game needed a little something extra, and I bet the expansion will provide that.

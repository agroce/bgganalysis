RATING: 9
First football sim I ever played so it holds a place for me.  As good as any football sim out there, some complain about the solitaire play but with a few tweaks and innovations from others, it works fine.  Just a fun game to play and a host of seasons to purchase from the game co or via eBay or other means.

This was once the best football sim out there, with fairly realistic results and great "flow." Originally it had many shortcomings (but some have been addressed in recent years). Additionally, the ratings are very subjective and sometimes blatantly skewed in favor of a Super Bowl winning team. S-O-M's computer version pales in comparison with Data Driven Football's.

Ultimately, S-O-M is still flawed in several areas; a prime example is that a team with a great running back and a poor passing attack will be forced to use the pass to set up the run. This is due to the extreme run/pass defensive choice inherent in the design. Using the silly run+key defensive call makes the problem far worse, especially in the current era of single running back offenses.

Similarly, a team with a poor running defense will typically have a very good passing defense, which is often a far cry from reality. In real life, if a team stinks against the run it will *naturally* give up fewer yards and first downs than average against the pass as opponents rumble along on the ground; however, this doesn't necessarily mean that the team is *good* against the pass.  In S-O-M these stats make such a team an unrealistically tough opponent on third and long.

No provision exists for a bend-but-not-break defense. If a defense gave up an average amount of yardage in real-life, in S-O-M the team will have an average defense -- even if it only gave up 14 points a game,  This is absurd. There are REASONS why such a defense gives up so few points (and it is not luck), something lost on this game's designers.

Incredibly, quarterback sack+fumbles don't exist in this game (unless it's been added in recent years)!

Not quite as good as the S-O-M Baseball. The game takes nearly as long to play as a real football game. The game seems to place too much emphasis on the quarterback and running back cards. You can’t sack a quarterback unless you call pass and you can’t sack the quarterback on a flat pass making sacks very rare. This game becomes a game of outguessing your opponent (run or pass). The game does not capture football the way the S-O-M manages to capture baseball. Many of the finer points are missing. Still it is game I will pull out a few times a year and enjoy.

If you love sports board games and you love football.  There can be no other choice than Strat-O-Matic Football.  When you are able to play the super advanced version - you have everything football has to offer.  The players are statistically accurate as are the game results.  I would love to find a league close by where this board game is used.  It seems computers have robbed the sports board game world of its players due to speed and time.  The quality of this football game and the player card printing is exceptional.  It plays solitaire very well.  No other football board game compares to it.  Not even close.

My last forays into Strat football were more than 20 years ago with my college roomie. I remember throwing to Mark Bavaro ... and throwing ... and throwing.

Stuff I remember that keeps me from going back are the clock rules with run plays always eating up :15 and passes eating up :30, sacks always resulting in the same loss of yardage, and the abstracted card for team "D". Statis Pro did football better, I think.

RATING: 10
I did enjoy this game when I had it. I had the 1987 version. While it produced realistic results, there were a few problems that could result in gaming the system if one were to go off script concerning non conventional play calling for the particular down and distance. 

I am very nit picky with football strategy games. Most are simply garbage in that the realism is just not there. I have owned every type of football game imaginable, from board games, to novel games, to video and computer games. Strat-o-matic actually played a really solid game of football. 

Score relative to back then.

In case anyone is wondering, Action PC Football by DK Sports is the most realistic and deeply satisfying football game out there. It's a computer game, though. It is my favorite game of any game to play. 

Additionally, in case anyone is wondering, I played the game at a high level and I have been married to football for much of my life. I know football better than anything else, except for law...

Having been a gridiron fan since the 80's when Channel 4 started showing it I bought the Statis Pro Football board game. I found it took too long to play often and the results a trifle unrealistic. It ended up going at a car-boot sale. 

Fast forward a good many years and I wished I hadn't parted with it. I purchased Strat O'Matic Football as a replacement and have found it to be simpler and to produce more accurate results. 

It definitely scratches my NFL itch! Now if only the Brighton B52's would get back together and the Miami Dolphins could find a new Dan Marino!

Not nearly as solitaire-friendly as SOM baseball, but a great game in its own right.  Elementary version is super-easy to play, but lots of fun.  The advanced and super-advanced versions introduce more personal, complex, and satisfying aspects of the NFL game.  These can be added a little at a time to ease the transition from easy-to-more-complex game play.  You could create a great league with the best 6 to 10 teams in any given year.  Again, simply an outstanding game, especially if you're a fan of season-replays, but fun for casual play as well.

No better football boardgame exists!  Skip the basic game and go straight to advanced (it's not really too "advanced").  Statistical results are somewhat realistic, and yes, there are a lot of dice involved.  A full-length advanced game is playable in about an hour after you get a good feel for the game (say 2 -3 games).

Yes, the game is largely unattractive in the component realm, but it rocks!

In a league setting, this is always my most tense gaming experience. Close games with playoff ramifications are so tense, I have been nauseated. Compared to the other SOM games, Football offers to broadest range of strategies and tactical plays, the best opportunities for bluffing, and for playing the opponent rather than the cards. I would like to see more offensive play calling options (double-teaming defensive linemen, passing to sides of the field, play actions, etc.), but playing in a continuous SOM football season is just about the most satisfying and nerve-racking gaming experience for me.

Can be extremely strategic, particularly using the super-advanced rules, but I've tended to find it a bit too tedious overall.  It seems that many of the additional rules over the past 10-20 years, while making the game more realistic, hurt the flow of gameplay.  Still a good football game...just not one I'd be inclined to play much any longer.

RATING: 6
This is an incredibly detailed statistical football game that simulates the NFL as accurately as is reasonably possible and has taught me (a lifelong casual football fan) a great deal about the game.  I truly admire it.  Unfortunately, in the hyper-super-duper Advanced version that we play in my league the constant consultation of 30 or more charts beyond the detailed player cards themselves begins to drain the life out of the system for me.  I would enjoy this game a good deal more if it played in an hour or so, but after a number of plays I'm still lucky to finish in three hours.

Countless hours of enjoyment from this game back in the day.  Not quite as good as SOM Baseball but still good.  A little surprised at the low average rating.  Obviously lacks the wow and pizzazz of modern day computer games and arguably could have simulated some aspects of the game better (e.g., interception returns, punting out of bounds inside 20 yard line) but for its time it was very good.  To caveat this review I have not played in 30+ years so I'm sure there's adjustments that have been made over the years.

Decent football game for authentic historical play.  Has lost some ground in my eyes after playing Pizza Box Football and 1st and Goal.  Those games keep the game moving at a much better pace and is much easier to teach.

I learned more about football playing a month of Strat O with a High School Defensive Guard friend than years of anything else. Look on EBAY and you'll see Strat O is alive and well. Can buy cards for your favorite team '73 to play against a dynasty team '95 because the game's mechanics mesh well.
 My only complaint is it's a little statistics heavy ?
and not easy to learn the first few times out. Could have some play variation (Flat Pass is a catch-all term, right ?).

A sports simulation has wandered into a database of games. In a perfect world, all sports simulations would be based on individual statistics. This is the one that proves that that can never work for football. It proved this by trying really hard. Football is probably the most game-like of American professional sports, with relevant decisions that can be reasonably well implemented, and you get that here. My lack of nitpicking here, compared to other sports simulations, is due to my lack of familiarity with football. Would like to try, at least once, the advanced version where tokens representing individual defenders can be positioned on the board. Worth a try if this sort of thing is your flask of tea.

Greatest football game ever. This is play calling strategy with absolutely realistic outcomes. Without question, I have played SOM more than any other game in my collection. 

The 1986 season was the first we played--and played a lot. The Steelers were 6-10, but I didn't care. The OT loss to the 5-11 Houston Oilers goes down as maybe the best game ever. Among other great ones, the '05 Steelers last second TD to beat the '86 Giants. Have played many seasons and the stats are spot on (unlike a lot of board and computer football games). The parts are dated, unattractive, and a little pricey, but this game is a must for those who love realistic football simulations.

Played again today (25 FEB 12) for the first time in a while--reconfirmed that this is one of my all time favorite games. It was the 2008 Steelers (SB Champs) at the 2008 NY Giants. Tight game and the Giants kicked a field goal on the last play to win 31-28 (enabled by a 25 yard pass interference on what would have been the last play of regulation followed by an off sides penalty against the Steelers on a missed Giants FG--the humanity!).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Perhaps my favorite football game. Some luck involved, long, and the long gain, short gain, and interception return charts are horribly unrealistic. But underneath the football guise is the best bluffing game I've ever played, with an incredible defensive system that requires both sides to be on their toes. (2008 with 1999 Super Bowl teams)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Excellent game.  Poor for solitaire play, but very good for face-to-face play.  

Using the rules that come with the game, the O-line and defensive ratings are not as heavily involved as in some football games.  

Limited play selection: 3/4 running plays; 3 passing plays.  

Can't move the CBs, SS, or DL on defense.  The Guess Pass/Run aspect of defense works really, really well in the Elementary game, but not so well in the Super Advanced Game.

I deducted significant points for shipping and customer service problems that others and I have experienced, especially in 2011.  Things seem to be deteriorating in those areas in the past year.  

Fortunately, there are excellent alternative games, including more modern games that are far more detailed and tactical.

The football simulations of APBA, Statis Pro, and Strat-o-Matic are all poor cousins to their baseball counterparts, feeling like afterthoughts somehow. If you buy Strat-o-Matic Football today, new in a shop, you'll open the box to be transported back 30 or 40 years; everything from the rulebook to the very poor components looks and feels sadly outdated. The game play is a fairly dry statistical progression--but it's easy to get into and it can work as a fun, swift game for those looking to take real pros into action. Its odd quirks include things like no plays going out of bounds and penalties introduced only in the advanced game. Worth a look if one is into sports sims.

Started with SOM Baseball, but Football is still the best one.

Best football game on the market, but it does take nearly four hours to play. Its fun, but long. I would rate it a bit higher if penalties were better integrated.

Best football simulation ever. A bit more fiddly than the baseball game but a lot is taken into account that other games on the subject don't.

Statis Pro Football (Avalon Hill) is so much better - and I am not only talking the graphics here.

One of my favourite games from my teenage years. My best friend was into Statis Pro but I always thought there was far more depth to this game having played both a lot. In Statis Pro, which was by no means a bad game, there were a certain number of plays that always seemed to work no matter what the opposition did, whereas Strat-o-Matic seemed to have far more variety to the outcomes of the plays you called. There was so much research done to each of the individual player cards that the outcome of games was always realistic (no ridiculous 100 - 99 scorelines, which is always a potential problem with sports simulations). In any simulation there has to be that element of realism or the game just doesn't work in my opinion. Probably the best sports-themed game I have played.

I own all of the teams from the 2009 season, and 5 teams from the 2007 season.

Tentative rating, based upon a solo play. I have a feeling I'll likely enjoy it more with an opponent.

Update: Found a deluxe edition game used for $15. Picked it up, and it turns out that 4 teams of the 28 were missing. Bah. Oh well. 1988 season.

basic version is awfully, well, basic - but plays more quickly than I remember from childhood. Still waiting to play advanced version.
UPDATE: Advanced version MUCH more enjoyable!

Played once with 1987 stats of Bears versus Redskins.  Lots of looking up and die rolls mean more than strategy of picking plays.

The basic game plays well and the advanced game adds a ton of nice depth to the decision making process.  Great for beginners and those seeking a more advanced football game.

My top-rated football simulation. Second Season football is more playable, if you're less concerned with detail.

Dated mechanics with lots of chart consulting.  It's difficult to figure out where a team's strengths are, even when you're familiar with that era.  The rules have tons of holes, and are often frustratingly vague.  As for the game itself, it's interesting as a simulation, but as a game it can get frustratingly chaotic. This seems like a game dying to be played solitaire.  My copy, unfortunately, had solitaire rules that were basically unplayable.  There are a few variants out there that I am really looking forward to trying, to see if that increases the fun factor.

This has the '84-'85 Teams (w/1983 stats)- Complete and in very good condition.  The box is the 1968 version, with some whitening and an edge rip, but still very sound.

Great for the football fanatic, unless you crave the graphics of the latest Madden video game. It's more a simulation than game in many aspects, and best played regularly in a league fashion.

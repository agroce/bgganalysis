A very chaotic game if you play by the standard rules. In that case I'd rate it a 5. If played by the variant where you get to know the production card in phase two, I'd rate it a 7.

RATING: 7
Big fan of the original C64 game and couldn't wait to get my hands on this.

Pros
+ Need to manage the stock market and manage supplies.
+ Very accurate interpretation/reproduction of original gameplay

Cons
- Fairly high amount of variability with the random events and the crystite cost.  

Variants: 

In the future I'll probably play with a "do not use the bad luck events" and do the production events before the development phase to allow people to plan accordingly.  Could possibly go up in rating based on those criteria.

Meh. Played once with beginner rules. Game provided few funny twists. Player interaction was little bit too low for my taste - there was no competition in market. Rulebook was also complicated, so we didn't get into the game very well. Maybe i try this again if convinced.

Further to my wish list comment, I finally found a copy on the sale table for half price ($60) and bought it, confirming that I shouldn't have paid any more for it - 4 fairly light gauge cardboard counter sheets and two bags of generic round coloured wooden pieces (ie no themed shaples and MULE stickers need to be applied to some), a single deck of cards plus a 3 panel game board and 4 lightish double-sided player mats which means only certain combinations of the 8 races can be used to make up the 4 players. The best 'component' is the fairly substantial rulebook which has numerous mix & match modular optional rules to allow for much customisation. They've even added on line a 'Director's Cut' rulebook for an even meatier option for play. Wildly varied opinions/ratings on BGG, so I'll have to give it a couple of plays to see if there's anything to it other than nostalgic novelty.

Rulebook on BGG:

I HAVE played it a couple of times now and really quite like it. It's RRP is a bit high based purely on components but it IS a good game, which is more than can be said for a lot of expensive Kickstarters!

As a fan of the old C64 game, that I´ve played over 100 times, I have to say that the conversion to the boardgame was perfectly done. I love the board game, but I strongly recommend to play the game with the "tournament" rules and without personal events (so completely skip phase 8). This will reduce the luck factor significantly and there is still some luck in the game (e.g. meteor, pirates etc.), that is coming with other cards (=production cards). Although my expectations and especially my doubts were quite high, I have to say that it´s an awesome game that perfectly covers the feeling of the old C64 game.  I like it a lot.

Does what I was hoping for. A nice accessible economic game that's well suited to people that aren't really into economic games. Random events stop the game being totally deterministic and provide a nice little catchup mechanic. Threat assessment may be a problem with the unlucky events.

Wow.  I wanted to like this game, but the production events are incredibly powerful and swingy.  The dynamic market is interesting, which makes the personal events and production all that more frustrating.  So much careful planning can be undone by the flip of a card.  Not my type of game.

Economic game with 4 items, 3(food, energy, ore) of which are needed to run the economy and the 4th (Crysite) has fluctuating prices and it can all be stolen by Pirates so you are pressing your luck by hanging on to it. I like it better then Planet Steam as the market does not fluctuate with each sale but after each round. Wonderful implementation of the 30+ year old computer game. I would say game play is a 6 but gets a +1 bump because of nostalgia.

The team did an amazing job in capturing the iconic 1983 computer game's magic and transferring it into a board game.

Being a long-time M.U.L.E. fan since the early nineties, and maintainer of a website solely dedicated to the game ( http://www.carpeludum.com/world-of-m-u-l-e ), my rating may be a bit biased. But the game is a dream come true for all M.U.L.E. fans!

M.U.L.E. is a life-long addiction, and the board game has its place right beside the iconic computer game original from 1983.

Meanwhile, since the Essen premiere, I could try the game with people who do not know M.U.L.E. the computer game. They appreciated the economic depth (compared to, say, Settlers of Catan), balanced gameplay (random events), auction mechanism, and at last the great presentation (art design).

Can't remember much of Planet Steam which I played years ago and has been one of the first MULE style games out there. Seems I forgot to rate it, too.

However, what I do remember is, that it was an ok game, nothing more. This one (M.U.L.E.) can't even catch up on Planet Steam... it's like they didn't only want to bring an old computer game from the 80s, but old boardgames like monopoly, too.

wtf?! you may ask, but man those completely stupid cards are like the event cards we had in Monopoly!

Of course, you could play without the cards, but even that doesn't save the game at all. There's just nothing behind it, but a light stock market game. The only interesting part is the building space and how / for what you'll use them, but that's just not enough to carry a game.

Rating may be a 5 without the cards.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: joc econòmic de gestió i explotació de recursos basat en un videojoc molt exitòs dels anys 80. Es tracta d'adquirir terres que proporcionen certs recursos i explotarles mitjançant una especie d'automates coneguts com a M.U.L.E.s. També hi ha un mercat que varia en funció de la demanda de recursos dels jugadors.

Sembla una bona adaptació i suposo que si hagués jugat al joc original podria ser una bona opció, però com a joc de taula no sembla gaire cosa...

I'm a huge fan of the Commodore 64 original, that I still play with friends occasionally.

Still early days with the boardgame, but after two 3-player tournament games, this feels like a solid interpretation. I'm hoping that the game will speed up a bit as we players gain more experience. I'm sure that our matches will become deeper strategically, too. I feel there is a good platform for that.

The thing about this game is, you have to adore the original to understand and appreciate what has been accomplished here.

This is a long game that feels like it should be about market manipulation and profiting off the things other players have or lack.  The think is, the random events make planning pretty much impossible and can completely ruin otherwise good play or wildly reward some pretty bad play.

The game isn't terrible it just wan't fun for me.

I'd rather play Planet Steam.

The number of included variations is simultaneously the game's greatest strength and its downfall. Once you have a list of curated variations (recently posted by the publisher), it's a very versatile game. Ameritrash to euro, this game can probably scratch that itch. New players or experienced? Same thing. Finding the right combinations of variations for your group is the real trick.

The theme is cool, the mechanics are great, and I love the self-adjusting market and power grid'esque battle to not be in first place, due to the catch up mechanicsms.

M.U.L.E. is a simple to understand economic game of gathering resources to sell for profit with lots of elements of luck involved which does a good job of emulating its namesake classic video game. I liked it, but I wasn't impressed by it. I did like the end round procedure of having the leader distribute a lucky event card to someone who then was tasked with distributing an unlucky event card to someone else.

I loved M.U.L.E. back in the day on the Commodore 64. I'm really amped to see it translated into board game format. I know a spiritual implementation was done, Planet Steam, but I felt it didn't do justice to the digital version. M.U.L.E.'s production quality is very well done. It captures the feel of the video game, is very attractive, and highly functional. I have to give props to the rule book as well. It is very well organized, has great play examples, and was printed in a font that makes reading through it a breeze.

At it's heart, M.U.L.E. is an economic engine building game. I've read criticisms that say that the randomness introduced by the cards ruins the game. My take is that it is true to the original game. I also need to point out a comment from the designer, "It is a competitive game, but meant to have a fun, thematic atmosphere as well." I feel that his comment sums it up quite well.

We need to play with the auctions next time, but it will certainly take longer. Some did not like the event cards, but they are why I got the game. I have enough perfect info economic games so wanted one that could throw a hammer in the works. The auction would also ramp up player interaction. We should also add the player powers. Still, I enjoyed playing but not totally convinced yet. Is the market to static? Should player purchases, sales more directly impact it?

RATING: 7
A neat economic game. I'd prefer if ore was also useful for anything, but I can see the reasoning behind a trade-only good (apart from the "mine this to win" good, whose name escapes me right now). I like how the bonus for producing the same in adjacent tiles reduces the impact of having good or bad cards. I thought that the land auction cards are badly developed and there should simply be a round of auctions at the beginning.

RATING: 6.5
An ok economical game, I liked the theme, the art and the feel, BUT the game has a big luck factor. It also falls into a kind of no man's land: long and somewhat heavy for casual gaming (mostly the econimical stuff), but maybe a bit too luck oriented and simple for heavy euro/economy gamers. This is too bad, because the theme and the look are pretty cool.

The tournament rules probably tweak the luck factor somewhat and add some complexity, but I don't know... the tournament rules seemed a bit redundant. For me, it's one of those "I liked it ok but probably won't play it again" games.

I appreciate the faithfulness of the adaptation but I have a nagging feeling that the market only works if the game is played in a certain way: If no one hoards blue but at least someone produces and (cluelessly) sells it, the price of blue/workers never rise, and there is never any shortage of workers on the market. Similarly, if everyone produces roughly the amount of green/orange they consume, prices of those never change either, and there is never anything for sale. The adjacency bonus production rule is absolutely crucial in ensuring excess resource production that keeps the market running. Why they left this rule out of the basic rules is beyond comprehension. 

Also, there is excessive kramerization, aka a massive amount of variant rules, which makes me wonder whether even the designer knows what the game is supposed to be.

A 3 or 4 player economics and market speculation game that has just enough luck and unpredictable factors to create a genuine sense of excitement and surprise so this game does not become like so many other stale economics and market speculation games that have come before.

RATING: 7
Transformed from the old C64 computer environment to a board game, this economic management game probably provides enjoyment in equals part nostalgia and gameplay... not that you needed to have played the old computer game to enjoy this, but those who did play it will often wax on nostalgically through most of the seven rounds of gameplay.

The game itself is decent; the gameplay options are rather straightforward and the luck of finding the best mining tiles and hitting the jackpot on production is the basic key to the game.  The Lucky/Unlucky cards to balance gameplay are only successful in balancing gameplay if the recipient of the lucky card is both able to recognize who is ahead in the game and is willing to give the unlucky card to their benefactor when it is deserved. 

I haven't found players fond enough of this game to try the advanced version.  I think this would be better, but unfortunately the game just does not have enough appeal to me to get it that next level.

A game we had on pre-order since Ron was a big fan of the computer game. 

I can't help but compare to Planet Steam. They have a lot of similar features. This one has an aspect of playing on a personal player board. Unlike Planet Steam the market only changes at the end of the round so it is MUCH nicer than Planet Steam. Friendlier, I guess you could say. 

I enjoyed this game. I think it is butt ugly but maybe that is me. I will play this game more and see how it I enjoy it a second time. After 1st play I enjoyed it but I still like Planet Steam more. A LOT more.

I remember M.U.L.E. being more fun (on the computer). This seemed like a random slog. The rules were a little unclear or somehow became unclear after we read them. Very odd.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
To start with the most important answer: yes, it's the M.U.L.E gameplay we all know from the 30+ years old C64 computer game captured in boardgamne mechanics. And it is enjoyable as a boardgame.

However, compared to the mostly luckless economic eurogames of today, it feels like the old times: a bit unbalanced and too much luck dependend. The flow of conversion rates of the goods in the game is very predictable (and as a consequence: easy to play). The personal events generated by the ranking will even the score between the highest and the lowest ranking players, which is more or less random depending on strategy of the players.

Having said that, I did enjoy the game although mostly because it produced nostalgic memeories and fed my couriosity. As a game it doesn't stand out and is clearly inferior to modern eco games (if you're into that). I would play it again, but can't convince myself to buy it.

Clever combination of mechanics, I especially liked how you can mine the same tiles for different resources. I didn't really like how the smithore only required a couple people mining it to flood the market and keep it perpetually cheap the whole game, with it having no real use outside of it, and it seemed like the entire economy could be flooded with goods, so I wish that were tighter. I didn't mind the random events and thought it just added flavor and kept people from running away with the victory too much.

tl;dr: solid

I've never played the video game this is based on. I hadn't even heard of it. I guess I'm not old enough. That's how old this video game is :)
Anywhoo... It's an economic game. Build some tiles that give you resources if you have harvesters and you power those. Sell and trade the resources for money. And the price of the resources changes over the course of the game.
What I found made this game work well is the interesting way in which he markets replenish and the market value is determined. Nice.
There are some elements with event cards and action cards that can hurt people, but they're optional, so if you want a pure clean euro that is an option as well.
I quite enjoyed this and look forward to playing it again.

M.U.L.E. continues to define the family-friendly economic battle.  This faithful reinvention of the elegant video game reveals its inner workings so that players can manage the pricing engine instead of the computer.  The result is that events, which serve a vital role in keeping the players together, seem a bit capricious.  The designer recommends several adjustments to increase predictability and I recommend them all.

As a fan of the C64 game, I wanted to like this game. But after one play, I agree with the other reviewers, it is too much a luck fest. But the bigger problem is, there isn't the tightness and tension of to C64 game. I tried my best to cause tension through shortages, but the penalty for a shortage is just a glancing blow. I will give it another play, but I won't get my hopes up.

First Impression:
This game was so frustratingly annoying we couldn't even finish our first session.

The basic premise is that you play this suppossingly tight economical, market manipulation euro, that comes with the full package of dryness, calculation and fiddlyness... only to have all your plans thrown radomly out of the window at the end of the turn due to a series of random events that pretty much decide the game for you. 

Please note I'm talking about apocalyptic level events here, not something that is just plain irritating. And events that trash specific players, not all. Like "player no2, literally, loses one (half) of his mules, Hurray!" The "trash all _most presious_ resources from player no3, hurray!"

I'm fine with light party games that have wild swings of luck to create chaos and buzz, but doing this in a game that is mascarading as a resource management heavy euro is the worst idea I've come across in quite a while.

If you want to play a dry game where your actions take a day but are at the same time almost completely meaningless, this is your long sought gem!

Just got this in the mail today. Loved playing the computer game...I’m really hoping the board game brings back some fond memories.

The art just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside (though some may find it "goofy").. but that name is giving me an headache.. it is so loud (and what does it all mean?). Ach.

One play with four, all were practically newbies (one had played once before, but with incorrect rules and not whole game). Nice game, a bit random, but nothing special as far as I can see. Tournament rules and optional rules might give something extra special, so I'm looking forward to try again.

This is basically a action point game, where the amount of points is defined by the actions you did last round. By the way, the game looks very good and the humor might open better, if you have played the original computer game.

I have not played the original computer game. The game tries to be strategic, but has too much randomness and take that.

Truly thematic to the original computer game and rated for that nostalgic throwback.  As for game play I'd put it in the "solid 7" category with elements of luck, more so than Planet Steam.  There's room for both in my collection.

A lighter version of Planet Steam.  There are lots of random events that will make many BGG'ers wince.  So, just realize that they exist.  If they are ok with you, play MULE.  If not, play Planet Steam.

Played at BGG Con 2015. Game was fun but the randomness of the events was somewhat weird and lessened the game for me. The market mechanics work really well except for the crystal one which is just randomness and detracts from the experience.

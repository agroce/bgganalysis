A fun risk/reward gambling game.  The trick seems to be balancing high-risk and low-risk bets, while doing your level best to manipulate the trade values.  Being Harbor Master seems to be very powerful.

120218 Gambling "thrills". I won and almost won my first two games....but I don't know how much playing I would actually want to do with it...kinda nervewracking. I suspect that a conservative approach may be the best. 

update: HMM, interesting, the original comment was written a couple years ago.  I just played again last night...again with a conservative approach.  With the help of my neighbor on the immediate right (who bid high several times in a row for harbor master), I was able to win again with a conservative approach.

Hated this at first but now I'm starting to see the true nature of this game. I won't buy this myself but will not turn down a game anymore.

Manila introduces a blend of luck, betting, speculation and tactics to the table. It is not a game to be taken very seriously due to the luck factor but it is not certainly a one that is only determined by dice rolls. It is your choice whether you pursue low or high risk avenues. You can always calculate the expectation values and read your opponents, which in the long run should turn the game to your favour but the good thing here is that probability is not does not take the shape of a delta function. Rare events take place as well.

The best thing about the game is that it has just the right play time. You feel that you actually contributed to the outcome before the whole process becomes tedious. 

I find Manila a healthy change to all more skill driven games. You still have a chance to affect how the game folds out but you cannot (nor should you) try to overanalyse it. Betting and speculation are fun. However, I do admit that Manila does not offer anything you would go raving about. It is a rather simple game and best played occasionally without too much thinking.

Very fun game where luck meets preparation.  Played it in a big group and it worked fabulously.  It has many things I don't like about Euros: a) pasted-on, nonsensical theme, b) bidding, c) 3+ player requirement.  Despite this, I liked it, and that's saying something.

It has pirates and that's really cool.  It would be cooler if they had a pirate ship that could come along the barges, open fire, and raid, loot, and pillage.  If you tossed in a dinosaur and Chuck Norris, this game would probably be perfect.

1st play: Reading the rules this game reminded me of winner's circle - and it is. There are bets to make, and as the game progresses, the bets become more known but also harder to get. Overall it's a good balance and some exciting moments. 

2nd play: Even better this time. Lots of exciting die rolls and some serious pirate action. I love how the odds of the different places on the board change throughout the round, and yet money stays tight.

This game is much easier to play than what you think from just reading the rules. However, the game is 45% luck, 45% guessing, and 10% planning and strategy. The most important decision is when and how much to bid for the right to buy shares, and there are only three or four chances to do so.

At least it plays relatively fast...

L'ambientazione è piuttosto appiccicata. Poteva esserci scritto anche Las Vegas e non cambiava assolutamente niente,considerato che a tutti gli effetti è praticamente un gioco di scommesse.Tutto molto colorato.Dà il meglio di se quando si è in 5 visto che le posizioni per le scommesse sono esclusive.Aggiungendo anche qualche house-rules probabilmente migliora anche di più (tipo i pirati che scalzano le pedine avversarie mettendosi in prima posizione  e spingendo giu l'ultimo arrivato).Da provare.

I love gambling games, and this is more interesting than the typical horse/camel game.  The odds/payouts are twisted, so once you figure out what to bet on there is competition for those wagers.  But that's what makes it a game and not just a day at the track/casino.

Attractive components.  The mechanics seem broken because purchasing shares early in the game is insanely valuable (because they're sure to go up) and this dominates the value of being harbourmaster.  I have never played with a group who correctly appraised this from the start so I can't say whether any interesting strategy emerges when the auctions are realistically competed.  But I'm not hopeful.

{2 plays, 5 player} I want to like it.  I'm one of those guys who doesn't mind a game being nothing but bets.  Certainly other players had fun with this one.  But I suspect it's all about getting "fun" dice rolls, with, unfortunately, not a lot you can do if you don't get them.  I'm more than willing to play yet again to see if I'm wrong, and hopefully my rating will go up.  But it doesn't feel like I'm wrong.

-- Updated initial 4 rating after 2 or 3 more plays --

Well, I was wrong... sorta.  Once I saw the game a little better, all the dice rolls became more "fun."  It still doesn't thrill me.  For one, it feels like an early trailing player is semi-screwed - and even if he isn't, they usually *feel* like they are, perhaps incorrectly opting for the potential death-spiral of those pirate spaces.  But mostly it's just the overall feel of the thing.  I know that's kinda lame and not entirely helpful, but I'm not exactly sure what it is myself.  Regardless, this is definitely not a 4.

Despite any appearances to the contrary, this is a gambling dice game through and through.  The board and mechanics liven the basic mechanics to the point that the game is interesting.  It is a chaotic affair and whoops and howls are not uncommon in any playing.  Grab a drink and a party type crowd and let the dice roll.  Keep it casual and avoid 'thinking' about it and your game experience is likely to be a good one. [GTI: AGCL]

I'm still unsure how many people I think this plays best with but I do enjoy it a lot.
Harbour-master is important, especially as you can't buy more shares without being the harbour-master and shares should be at least 3/4 of your points at the end.
Some people do seem to be lucky with their rolls and so where you place can depend on who is rolling that round.

I always want to bet on a pirate, but it is dangerous…. Still some players manage to get away with it. Ira is lucky about Pirates. Whenever she bets on Pirates she wins.

I want to roll good so often but it rarely comes my way.

Enjoyable mechanics and a multitude of strategies, but a little too much luck for some of the more hard core gamers as dice heavily dictact the outcome of rounds.  More strategic gambeling, but I enjoy that kind of a change up from time to time in my gaming.

RATING: 7.5
Very simple game, with some luck involved. 

It's basically a race where you "bet" in certain actions as the game unfolds. Betting early and with more risk can get you a big payout, betting later offers a more limited options. 

If you tolerate dice rolling luck and a bit of backstabbing it's worth checking this out.

RATING: 4
Az alapötlet nem lenne rossz (könnyed kis részvényes, ami esetleg gyerekeknek is jó), de másfél órás játékidőhöz képest nevetségesen nagy a szerencse szerepe. A játékidő háromnegyede kb. a worker placement rész, de MINDEN hely, ahova tehetjük a bábukat, szinte kizárólag  a szerencsétől (értsd a körönkénti 3x3 kocka dobott eredménye) függően jövedelmez. A legrosszabb kezdőhelyen álló hajó is befuthat 3 jó dobással, de a tuti helyről is elveszhet a szállítmány. A kalózos rész is 100% szerencse. A biztosítós talán az egyetlen kiszámítható bevétel, ha valaki utolsók közt teszi oda a bábúját, mert akkor tuti marad belőle valami.
A slusszpoént nem is mondtam: a 2 kezdőrészvény... a végső pontszám fele nálunk ezen dőlt el, és ez is 100% szerencse, hogy kinek mi jut az elején.
Partijátéknak lehet, hogy jó...

I've played a 3 player and 5 player games now.  That being said, I'm betting 4 players will be best.  The number of possible bets stays the same regardless of the number of people.  With 5, you do have some control taken from your hands and with 3 everyone has tons of choices.  This game does have dice and is essentially gamling, but there are clearly different ways to approach the game.  I look forward to trying some non-standard strategies to see how they pan out.

I have to reply to Richard Fawkes´ comment! Sure, this is no "luckfree brainburner", as it uses dice. But it is definitely no "luckfest". You have to work very exactly with probabilities. In some ways it is like "Bluff", but gives much more possibilities for your decision.

[i]Posted: 6/27/07, Rated: 8[/i]

[i]Manila[/i] is a delightful repackaging of [i][thing=10815]Craps[/thing][/i].  Perhaps that isn't the most accurate analogy, but there are definitely some similarities.  Imagine you are walking around a tropically-themed [i][thing=10815]Craps[/thing][/i] table: there are pass line bets (placing your associates on board the punts), come bets (placing your apprentices on board the punts in subsequent rounds), don't pass bets (the shipyard spaces), don't come bets (Pirate spots), and hard ways (dock spaces).  The odds are different in [i]Manila,[/i] and you have three different games being played simultaneously, each using only one die.

Okay, I admit that I'm reaching.  However, [i][thing=10815]Craps[/thing][/i] is a fun game, and [i]Manila[/i] is too, for many of the same reasons.  You can bet on long shots.  You can play the odds.  There is even an auction which does a good job of balancing the wealth.  Side note: in my opinion auction mechanisms are too easily bolted on to games in an effort to compensate for a lack of balance elsewhere.  In [i]Manila[/i], the auction does more than normalize resources: it is the only available mechanism to obtain more shares.   A stock market determines the value of each trade good, and also acts as the end-game timer.

All of these components, combined with a colorful presentation and pleasing artwork result in a solid game.  I'm docking one point for rules which feel unpolished.  In at least one instance an attempt to streamline them created an inconsistency: the rules as written allow players to "bet" on a ship that has already come in.  Yet that was not the author's original intent according to [article=505355]this post[/article].  Similar ambiguities exist with regard to mortgaged shares, and even what constitutes a successful journey.  I'm docking it another point because I'm not sure this game is going to have staying power: if I had a choice of playing [i]Manila,[/i] or one of the games which I have rated a "9," there's no contest: the "9" will win out.

[i]Manila[/i] is a game that my family likes playing.  It also allows me to enjoy a [i][thing=10815]Craps[/thing][/i]-like experience without feeling guilty that I'm teaching my sons Vegas-style gambling.  They have plenty of time to acquire that appetite on their own.

This game has everything I love in a game: Great components (the wooden ships are awesome), cool looking board, a push your luck gambling mechanic, and secret information (which stock is each person collecting). All of this comes together in a game that I really enjoy. Every game I have played I can think back to who won, what was the strategy, and some amazingly lucky roll someone did that we laughed about for the rest of the game.

Great game for a lighter atmosphere.  Pretty accessible for light and non-gamers.  Like Carcassonne, though, a mix of light and more competitive gamers can lead to large inequities if the experienced players are really gunning to win.  In this case, due to aggressive bidding over the Harbor Master.  Still, the gambling mechanic is a lot of fun.  It's hard for everyone not to be shouting over a dice role when all the ships are within spitting distance of the harbor but a pirate or two is lying in wait.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the game where you bet on different outcomes of the action on the board. Feels kinda like roulette in that way. Game starts out with a bid to be the harbor master so that you may roll the dice and control the boats. Harbor master also gets to place first bets which allows for cheapest placement into the boats. Do not be last. Either be first, or get the player to your left to bid highest. This way you will get good position and first crack at the best spots. Being harbor master also lets you buy goods which will rise in value like stocks. Early harbor master allows you to by when prices are low.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A gambling and risk management game with an interesting auction at the beginning of each round. There is luck, but you can push it in your direction with the right plays. The decision of what to bid for the harbormaster (who gives the winner some very important perks) is a tough and delicious mechanic to assess. The game is fun with the right group and the components are excellent.

OK, fine - it's roulette. But you've got more control at least, and if the rolls don't go your way, get over it - I'm having too much fun praying for my pirates to strike, bidding up the auction, or wondering whether it really was such a good idea to grab that "free" 10 from the insurance role.

Favorite social gambling game.  Would rate it a 9 with 4 players and a 7 with 3.

Only complaint is that it does not come with enough coins and does not play with 2.

My best five player game that does not play too long. Great game to have around, everyone seems to like it and you can easily play it a normal weekday evening.

Update: I like this game, but my friends don't, so I sold it. I miss it in a way, would like to play it again some time.

RATING: 6.5
The euro-like mechanisms built around a simple dice-rolling race felt a bit of an awkward fit and it ends up being neither one thing nor the other. I think my main gripe is that there are simply too few dice rolls (3 per boat in each race) which results in luck being way too much of a factor.

Enjoyed the first few games trememdously, but enjoyment per play fell off fast.  Choices seem a bit obvious and limited after the auction, and there are better pure auction games out there.

Had this downrated to a 6, upping it a point.  I had a pretty good time the last couple of plays.  Decent gateway game.

I like "playing the odds" in a game.  The box insert and components are great too.

It's strange, there are parts of the game I normally wouldn't like (variable game length, an auction to force game balance) but they work well here.  Quite enjoyable.

Only knock against it for me is that it is very, very repetitive.  You're basically doing the same thing over and over, and it's a little tiring by about the fifth round.  Also, I do not recommend playing with 5 players; the player to the right of the harbourmaster is going to have a difficult round.

I greatly enjoy these gambling style games. It gives me a similar feel to Camel Up or Winner's Circle, where the game can swing dramatically on a single die roll. It's Las Vegas in a box. I recognize how detrimental that can be for some gamers who prefer more strategic control, but for me this style of game is full of laughs and fun with the right group.

The Good - The dicey games and I get along pretty well, and this one's a hoot.  This one has just enough luck and chance to make things exciting and unpredictable.  It's still fun, even though I NEVER WIN.

Described to me as Craps mixed with stock speculation and a few auctions.  A strange combination, but it works okay.  Too random for my taste... but I can see that it would be good for families and casual gamers.  The rulebook is long and overly complicated... but once you learn the rules the game is pretty straight-forward and easy to explain.

Manila is a very fun speculative trading game, where you try to place your workers to make the most money.  Great bits make this an enjoyable game to play.  Easy to teach, I think of it as a roulette style betting game made over three rounds of roll-and-movement.  Some strategic elements include: bidding for the Harbormaster, buying shares, and using the Pilot spaces.  I have heard complaints that it is an expensive game to buy, but I think it is justified to get a great product appealing to new gamers.

One of only a few 'betting' games I play, but I do like the mechanic in this.  The theme works well, aside from a pirate joining a ship instead of plundering it at times...that makes you scratch your head.  The tension is pretty good as scores are relatively close at the end.  The game has a nice visual appeal.

The dice rolling is quite tolerable, as you pretty much can determine as the Harbor Master which one boat will make it and mostly overcome the luck factor. A big key is deciding when and how much to bid for the Harbor Master. One must get this position at least once to obtain more shares and influence which of the goods can make the harbor. The game offers a nice tension since there is some uncertainty as to whether your punt (boat) will make the harbor to score. I like the pirate feature, which can provide much needed funds when other options are not available, but it can also be a real boon to players that invest in it often. This is also a decent family game - popular with the kids.

Being an avid poker player I usually enjoy games where dealing with odds and manipulating them makes a difference. Manilla being a odds game should be right up my alley right?

So much fun. Whether you're auctioning for harbormaster, speculating on stocks, bidding on boats, risking the insurance man, or betting it all on the pirate, this game has everything a die-hard gambler could ever want!

Very entertaining betting game.  The key is making sure that the player who gets to be harbormaster pays dearly for the privilege.  If the harbormaster goes too cheaply at auction, the game becomes a blowout since commodity shares are worth so much more at the end of the game than what you can hope to win in bets along the way.

It's a fun game where you struggle to do all what you'd love to. There is a dose of luck, but there are ways of mitigating that. At the end of the day you are playing a betting game. The initial bidding phase and how you increase your stock in the market adds more strategy elements that compensate the luck of the dice. 

There may be confusing for some people at the beginning, but once everyone has understood it and plays their turns quickly, the game just flows. Otherwise it can go above the 90 mins which kills the game a little bit.

RATING: 6
Fun enough to play every great once in a while.  The meat of the game is bidding to control which punts will be in the game for the round, as there are four colors of punt, and the auction winner gets to choose which three of the four will be used in a round. This is important since players also own stock, and the stock can only become more valuable if that stock's boat actually participates.

Past that, the game is pretty much just betting on dice rolls and playing odds. You cheer and groan depending on the rolls, and that's that. Not much going on there.

Overall, a game I used to like a lot more, but I seem to like less and less over the years. Still good for a periodic nostalgia play.

This gaming combines betting, dice-rolling and risk/earnings assessments. Thus, there might be something in here for everyone in a context of family gaming. For instance, the kids might get excited about the betting and the "race factor", whereas Dad's drawn to the more calculational side of things. Fun.

The harbourmaster is obviously very powerful. As others have noted, players need to ensure this role cannot be obtained cheaply. Otherwise - should one player gain this role often - you're going to have a runaway leader. The economic margin of being the harbourmaster needs to be minimal. Make him pay dearly! This in turn makes money tighter, which makes matters a good deal more interesting.

A possible drawback may be a certain feeling of repetitiveness setting in similar to other entries into the race/betting genre (e.g Royal Turf). In view of this and the little setup variation, I don't think Manila sports a remarkable replay factor.

I do not mind dice-rolling being central to the races, though this might not appeal to some other "serious" gamers.

My verdict: Good, but not great. I'd be happy to play it again, though in no particular rush to do so.

I'm betting upon Manila winning 2005's Spiel des Jahres award. It's got SdJ written all over it. Considering that Zoch is also sending another hot candidate into the race - Niagara - I trust this will prove a good year for that company.

Neat little betting game. Sufficiently captures the fun and inherent drama in gambling, I think. Great production quality, too. The bits really add to the fun.

It is kind of lame that being the harbor master is SO key in the early game. As it's the only way to buy extra crucial extra shares, I wouldn't be surprised if the winner was generally determined really early on only nobody knows who it is because of the closed shares you start with.

Still, even knowing that this is a game I will happily play any time. It's one of the few games where there's an obvious winning strategy and it doesn't really impact the fun.

Received this in a trade for Stone Age and Cold War: CIA vs. KGB. That might seem like blasphemy to some, but I was intrigued by a betting game, and I didn't have one until this copy.

Initial rating "8" after one play. A gambling game that offers a healthy dose of fun. Unfortunately, first play was with three people. It was good, but I have to imagine this game would really shine with 5 people hunched over anticipating the die rolls.

This game does an excellent job of capturing that "casino craps" feel... but with some tactics. This is also, potentially, a gateway game. I need a few more plays to see if my rating changes on this one, but right now, it's meeting my relatively high expectations.

Update: finally got this to the table with five players. Noticeably better with this number. Three "bets" is much more tense, and the good spots dry up sooner. However, this is a relatively light game, and not the best choice for the overly analytical. Choose this game for groups that can ride along with the pseudo-"craps" vibe of the game.

Update 10/09: How did I miss the importance of shareholding in my earlier comments? The betting is, for sure, a very fun part of the game (and not nearly as predictable or repetitive as I first thought), but the depth comes from the shareholding and how it interacts with auction, the boatloading choices, and in-race decisions. Not to say this is a heavy game. It is definitely a beer and pretzels/yell and bang on the table game. And a great one. But never doubt that there are many layers to Delonge's designs.As for my too-long-for-what-it-is comment: Pish! This game plays in about an hour and it is a hoot the whole way through. Up to an 8 with room to grow. 

My 7 rating is after two plays. It is an average of 6 on the first play and 8 on the second. I think the second play was more representative of the 'fun' factor I'd heard so much about. I think the game is a) a little bit too long for what it is and b) a little repetitive and predictable in people's selection of follower-placement. The unpredictability is in the rolling of the dice. That said, it is a good dice-rolling game with lots of tension and excitement. For some reason it reminds me of craps with all the side bets. I have a feeling that continuing to play with the right people will send the rating up to at least a solid 8 for fun factor (and lovely bits) alone.

This game is really a 5, but everyone I play it with loves it so much that they get a voice here.  The bad first, then the good.

For starters, I consider myself generally good at assimilating and explaining rules.  Manila has easily the least favorable rules-explanation-to-playing-time ratio of any of my games.  I cannot teach this game quickly.  What should be an ultra-fast gambling game grinds to a halt before it even begins, because the timing of the pirates and the pilots is very specific and hard to explain quickly.  The first time boats land on the pirates' space, invariably somebody is confused about whether they just get to board the ship or if they get to sink it.  Don't get me started on the pilots.

Then the harbor master position!  This is the most important part of the game and it's an AUCTION!  How are new players supposed to be able to value that guy?  I've played more than anyone else and I don't know how to value him.

How do loans work, exactly?  The rules tell me kind of how they work.  We just let everyone do anything they want when it comes to loans because in the end all of these dumb subsystems--loans, harbor master, stocks (Jesus H. Christ), are totally irrelevant to the game.

The game itself, which takes place in a different universe which only tangentially relates to who 'wins,' is a super fun Craps variant with awesomely overproduced pieces, crazy-good money, and pirates.

This is the silliest game I own that people still request and actually gets played.  It's pretty much nonstop laughter.  The variant where all stocks start at '0' is a very good one.  We've played both ways, and genuinely the only impact we perceive on the game is its length.

15+ plays (at least 5p, 4p, 3p) - I love it. One of my favorites. The gambling and investment, mixed teamwork and competition (like Colossal Arena, Long Shot), and fast paced mechanics produce bottled lightning game juice for spirited play -- it's what I enjoy so much. Some of that may come from game companions similarly inspired. Cursing and drinking, waving arms... Superlative with 5 players. Update: over the years, continues to be a favorite.

Wonderful gambling/ betting game with the odds/ state of play updating constantly. Light, but certainly not fluffy. 

The harbourmaster role allows you to stack the odds in your favour by a large amount and the auction to see who gets this role in each round can be brutal.

People can take this game a bit too seriously. 
The harbourmaster auction needs attention, as it is where the game is usually won or lost. But after that play it fast and loose. It's got dice, it's got pirates, you're pushing little wooden boats around. 

The later decisions in the round are meaningful, but the risk/reward isn't high enough to worry too much about.

Also it is really a great game to look at, a proper toy.

Highly recommended for the games library.

A betting/gambling game where you have relatively little control over the outcome, much less so than in Royal Turf/Winner's Circle, for example. Often, it doesn't seem that there are enough interesting choices. And I'm not sure how well the betting/gambling mechanism meshes with the stock-market/auction mechanism. Still, it works and is kind of fun as a beer and pretzels game every once in a while.

RATING: 6.5
Despite some similar marketing to Niagara, this is a more interesting game. I would have played it sooner if I hadn't thought it was somehow related to Niagara.

This is a game that will appeal strongly to those who enjoy calculating odds and gambling. Its essentially a well-themed gambling exercise. There is a lot of luck in the dice, but with the exception of the hidden information of the starting shares, its formulaic as to your best move. If you can discern who has which stocks, your decisions should be obvious if you're half-way good at probability. So creating deception as to which stocks you hold becomes critical to good play when playing strong opponents.

Played in a lighter way, its a fun family dice game.

I'd play again, but I don't feel the need to own it.

RATING: 4
A cute gambling game with very nice bits but not nearly as many options as it looks like when you first sit down with it. Manila is basically about risk assessment, investment, and rolling the bones as well as possible. Played extremely quickly, by seasoned players, I imagine it would be very light-hearted and fun. However, I think the reality is that I need to be realistic and say that this is the kind of game that would work best with non-gamers, and the rules that need to be explained are cumbersome for the depth that this game has.It also seemed that stocks were the most obvious route to victory, and that anything else was fraught with pure risk, as the only way to really cash in as quickly as one does with the stocks is by outright piracy, or by getting extremely lucky and being in the fourth slot on either side of the finish line when the right thing occurs. The basic bottom line is that to win you need to either get control of the harbour master more often than the opposition (since he gives one the power to buy stocks and manipulate which goods increase in value) or to get very lucky when one takes the big risks. It's charming, but not great and ultimately disposable.

It's really just a gambling/horse racing game, but Manila is a heck of a lot better than most and there are subtle layers of betting strategies hiding behind the luck of the dice.  The self-appointed internet pundits will scoff at the luck element but there isn't much more here than in Settlers.  There is a refined, almost classical sense to Manila- it feels somewhat like an older German game but given the stagnation and mediocrity that is starting to plague that sector it's nice to play a game that could be considered a return to form for the genre.  It's a fantastically fun game, gripping and engaging through every turn.  This should probably be Spiel Des Jahres, it's considerably more interesting and replayable than 80 Days.

This is a game I will NEVER part with.

I had not anticipated that the game would rank so highly on this site. When I played it (with 3 players), I found it to be a somewhat interesting mix of very simple stock mechanics and lots of bluffing and gambling—not altogether an unpleasant mix. But... there's a but, of course. The game takes fairly long to complete, and given that observation the raw influence of the dice is simply too big to make it a pleasant gaming session. The one time I played we broke off halfway, and none of the participants felt in any way cheated about that decision. To make the game playable for me, there need to be a few rule tweaks, which deal with the 'raw' randomness of the dice. You can make dice work in a way I approve of; in its current forum Manilla is not a member of the Dice Done Right Club™.

[b]Update[/b] Another attempt... which was aborted not four rounds in for much the same reasons. Really, just throw the 4D6 once and say that whoever rolled the highest total won. Not going to play this game again.

Kind of felt like Niagara, but really the games are nothing alike except there are boats on water that move around.  I really enjoyed the take that aspect, but I suspect with more play this might turn out to be much more an analytical sort of game.  But with the dice, maybe not

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español** Manila es realmente un juego divertidísimo y uno de los mejores en cuanto a diseño-diversión. El factor suerte en el juego diría que es mucho menor de lo que aparenta a primera vista, puede que el factor más aleatorio del juego sea el reparto inicial de mercancía. Puede que bien jugado el 90% de los filipinos de los jugadores deberían de repartirse entre las apuestas de las barcas y los piratas. Si te gusta el casino este es tu juego.

Sin lugar a dudas Manila es de lo mejorcito de juegos con tablero para iniciar a la gente en el eurogame gracias a su sencillez, si alguno de los jugadores no se quiere complicar, pasa del puesto del capitán, sin embargo, los jugadores más veteranos siempre lo tendrán en cuenta.[/COLOR]

I taught and played this upwards of 10 times over a span of a few days and enjoyed it almost every play (there was one game in which the luck aspect hit hard and threw things completely out of whack).

It's a good ride.  There's a serious Vegas factor (dice rolling woohoo!), the betting is fun and I do like auctions and stocks in a game.

That said I'm not sure of its staying power.  With experienced players I can see the game dragging a bit as everyone tries to ensure that their stocks stay in the race.  The pirates are a long shot, but if they hit more than once or twice in a game (especially if the same person gets the booty each time) things can go awry badly.

I'm happy to own it and I'm sure it'll get its fair share of play.

Very fun game.  I think unexperienced players (which we were) can either extremly undervalue or overvalue the cost of the harbor master. Otherwise very very good game.  I admit strategy is hit or miss because of the tactical nature of the game, but the mechanics are elegant and mix together beautifully.  Nothing seems forced or unbalanced.

Production: Incredible production, with Tonga-Bonga-rivalling money, solid wooden accomplices and boats, brilliant, vivid artwork.

Play: Becoming the harbor master appears to be a devastatingly superior position, which gains one more money, making one more likely to win the position of harbor master.  And aside from the two pilots, who have minimal influence, all other placement decisions are merely speculative of the outcome of rolling 3d6.  Those two major elements aside, I still really enjoy the game, especially because there are so many ways to have an accomplice produce profit, but each at different risk.  Better with more players.

Rules need an FAQ.
I felt that I was sitting there making decisions on gambling on dice rolls with some massive swings possible.
On the last turn of one game the situation was a D6
 1: I get 0 Yellow gain 6.
 2: I get 0 Red gets 24 (Pirate)
 3-6 I get 44, Orange gets 20, Blue gets 15.

It seens a cumbersome mechanism to play Poker with.

When I finished playing, even though I won in a landslide, I was ready to drop a '3' on this. It boils down to betting on dice rolls, with occasional opportunities to modify the rolls slightly. The components are awesome, and there is some comedy value to the silly play, but it's too long for what it is. In retrospect, it was kinda enjoyable, if not a particularly good game, so I'll give it a generous '5'.

In our 4-player game, one guy *never* won the Harbormaster auction. So he never got to do anything other than place his meeples and hope for the best. Interestingly, he came in second (by a wide margin over third and fourth).

I had fun with this, but we played a shorter version with the stocks starting at '0'. Typical high-risk investment game (gambling) with plenty of options on how to make that bet.

Got this as I heard it was as fun as monkeys in a barrel.

It is reasonably fun. Played it with coworkers who are just being indoctrinated into the way of the lunchtime game. We all discovered quite quickly that the Harbourmaster is a game-winning position, and using him effectively is simply the easiest way to get ahead. It's like you can bid on being the "house" in a casino.

This, unfortunately, killed a lot of the fun for the other players, and it probably won't be back on the table soon at work.

The way the math works out in my twisted mind - and mind you, it is twisted - is that the harbourmaster is worth up to 30 pesos (though this decreases over time as the share prices increase). This is because you can drive up the share price of the shares you hold to 30, and if you keep buying them as the harbourmaster, you aren't effectively losing anything, and you are most likely getting on a winning ship every time at the cheapest rate.

All the other ways of making money are basically gambling.

Lovely looking speculation game.  Each turn, three punts run smuggled goods into Manila via the whim of dice rolls.  Some make it, some don't.  Players pay cash to either bet on the outcome, or to influence the outcome.  The payoffs are reflected by the odds.  Most cash plus "share" value in goods wins.  Stunning components, fun game play, and it all works very well.  Problems?  It feels a little long - 45 minutes would be perfect.  Also, being dealt a pair of hidden share cards can hurt.  Reminded me of Knizia's Members Only.

[Delonge] Yet another great game from Delonge, the maker of such awesome titles as Big City, Hellas, and dos Rios. Here, you hold an auction to determine who will be 'harbormaster', then you start three rounds of betting on a race. Repeat until one racer wins four races and total up the score. The harbormaster gets to bet first, and handicaps the three racers to his advantage, and even picks one racer that will not compete. 
 
Amazingly, the payouts and choices are perfectly balanced. The game is tense, fun, fast, and [as is usual for Zoch] absolutely beautiful. Deseving but overlooked at SdJ 2005. Highly recommended.

My favorite dice betting game, with a nice board and bits (chunky boats, Chinese meeples) wrapped around it.  The stock market adds a real nice element to the scoring.  Plays plenty fast with experienced players.  Pirates are high risk but can be massively high reward, so be careful of that.  The Harbor Master advantages are also critical to understand.   Has had a lot of appeal with non-gamers in my experience - probably due to it's casino-like nature.

Interestingly this Euro game is relatively luck-heavy (basically one is betting on barges which arrive or not arrive depending on a set of dice rolls which can barely be influenced). Also the initial share deal can be decisive. Once players have discovered the real value of the harbour master role (which should go up to around 20-30 value), players who haven't earned enough money will look a little sad. The pirate seems to be too expensive for a last resort choice, as he is practically never succesful, even with the optional rule. But still this has many nice ideas and the playing material is beautiful. If you are up to some light fare, this could be a good choice.

Basically you are just playing craps. In a worker placement way. With a turn order bid function.

Gorgeous game, very attractive to newcomers--and easy to teach, to boot. Lots of fun to root on the boats, similar to the excitement at a craps table. Playing an accomplice as a pirate earns a hearty "yaarr!" As the game goes along, it can feel as if you're making no progress as bets fail and you show little profit from round to round. Bidding on the harbor master can really hurt your cash flow, but is critical for advancing your shares' worth. However, at the end, adding up your cash and shares proves quite profitable.

It's craps with a theme on it.  But since I love craps, I love this.  It totally hooked my friends - gamers and non-gamers alike - and is perfect when you want a fun game.

Played 5+ times. Like many 3-5p player games, Manila is fairly weak with 3 since the boats tend to get "staffed" with one of each color. But with 4 or 5 players this game is a riot. I am not suggesting by any means that this game is strategic -- hardly! -- but it is incredibly fun. It's a money-making game that has stock holdings, but plenty of other ways to make money: running insurance booth, shipping goods, pirating ships, repairing ships, receiving shipped goods -- all of this in a very simple package. This game reminds me a LOT of Goldbrau, except it is strong in every area Goldbrau was weak. Great game that just keeps asking to be pulled off the shelf! (Sold to friend (KSand) for birthday present: 4-5 players made it tough to get onto the table.)

Do I have a choice? It's a game named after the city I've lived most of my life in, but two things - first, that cover has NOTHING to do with the city of Manila. The volcano in the background, Mount Mayon, is way north of here. Second, did the game REALLY have to be a luckfest? Damn. Franz Benno-Delonge finally found a way to get me to want one of his games, if only to show off to friends hereabouts. Still wish it was a luckless system-driven brainburner a-la Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence or Goa. Why do THOSE places get all the good games named after them? :(

A very engaging betting game with great detailed artwork, lots of options on what to bet on, and a cool auction element as well.  I think this would make a great gateway game for non-gamers.  One of the best games I know of that involves dice.  To call it "very fun" seems trite, but it fits my definition of "fun" very well.

Beautiful game! I really enjoy this one only with 4-5. Nongamers can too. This game gets better with some house rules and variants to make it more deep. So far I like the following house rules: 1.Play with hidden money 2.Instead of Harbor Master getting all the privileges do a blind bid for who gets to buy a share this turn (only that person pays their bid). The remaining players then auction off to highest bidder "Harbor Master" who has normal privilages except for ability to buy a share. 3.Punts NOT allowed to start on space 5 and you only get 8 points to spend however 2 punts cannot start at position 4.

I love the little racial stereotype figurines! So adorable. I'm also a fan of this game because I once smuggled goods into Manila in real life, no joke. But also, it really is just a great betting game with some interesting elements of leeching and craps stats.

Manila is a mixture between an investment and a gambling game. Players bet on the results of boat races (they aren't quite races since it doesn't matter who comes first; it's only finishing that counts). They also buy shares of the boats, and the shares of all boats that finish a race go up a notch. Whoever has the most money at the end of the game is the winner.

There are a few clever ways to influence which boats will reach the harbour - in the end it's all up to the dice, however since that's the primary means of movement. In short, a great filler, not too thinky, and lots of fun if you manage to stop the final barge just short of the finish line.

I prefer a game that has luck as an occasional spanner in the works - not a game that is luck based at its core. I won this game by guessing that Harbour Master was good early on and purchasing a commodity that paid off at the end. The game in between just filled in time with guessing outcomes to keep the risk down. I never once felt I had any control of how my play would effect my finishing score.
I also didn't like the theme as I find the dishonesty of smuggling and piracy distasteful - and there is enough match between the theme and the mechanics to remind me of what I was playing. Others may find this a plus.

If I were in charge of creating a dictionary of boardgames, I would define Manila as proof I should never go to Las Vegas.  Whatever it is, I always do poorly when involved in any sort of betting.  This however, does not derive me of having plenty of fun and laughs.  Manila is beautifuuly crafted in both mechanics and components and blends betting with stock management flawlessly.  Manila and Big City make Delonge one of my favorite game designers. 

UPDATE: I have dropped Manilla a point due to it not always being a hit with fellow players.  I think the design, and the mix of gambling and stock investment to be a great success personally but this game's appeal is largely contingent on the crowd available.

I really like Manila : it's different, it's fun and it's pretty (look at those nice little junks with their loads of silk and ginger ;-) My wife hates Manila : she says there's too much luck in it and it's not fun ! So we  will not play it so often and I regret it. I like that 3rd round of dice so much : will it reach the pirates wave ? will it make it to the harbor ? Is the insurer going to get away with their 10 bucks ?
So, I rate it a 7 while my wife is away (And I will stick to it when she comes back :-))

PS : Thank you Bruno Faidutti for such a nice review of Manila in your ideal game library. You made me want to order it and buy it. And thank you Franz Benno for designing it.

Having just returned from Vegas, I can't help but compare this game to Craps, and I mean that as a compliment.  It's fun betting for or against the boats, although in our game, someone had a big early lead which allowed them to pretty much dominate the entire game.  Being 'Harbor Master' is pretty darn important early on, especially when you can buy cards for so cheap.  Beautiful components in this game, especially the boats.  There can be an issue of the rich getting richer, I think, but I still enjoy the game.

Update: Upon further playings I think this game is a keeper.  It's gone over well with 3 different groups now and seems to work with non-gamery types as well a BBGeek such as myself.  The game can drag a bit, so I think it best to play this at a pretty decent clip.  Also, starting the Black Market resources at 0 is a fine idea.

Update: Tried the closed hand auction for determining Harbor Master.  I think it does help to speed up the game, but the auctions do lose a little bit of tension as a result.

Bought May 2013. This is a great betting game with relatively straightforward rules and satisfying components. But I didn't get my copy to the table for years - I think that's primarily because the auction for harbourmaster is so valuable yet so hard to value, which is an obstacle for new players. Wouldn't be a problem if your group played it regularly.

I once had a game where the auction for harbourmaster got to such high values it locked out the players that were trailing behind and prevented them from catching up. In general, this is not a game where the final scores are typically close.

The rulebook is crazy detailed, but the rules are nicely summarised in the margins and that's actually all you need to read. My copy also came with a DVD that shows you how to play but I've never watched it!

I think whenever we had an opportunity to play this, designer Franz-Benno Delonge's masterpiece [thing=26990][/thing] got picked instead. Sold July 2017.

What a great game! Sail the waters of Manila and run goods into port, if you are the harbormaster (something you have to bid and win) you control the initial boat movement and are allowed to place your people first. Others go along for the ride, become pirates, have end round control over some of the boat movement, or just wait for the ships to come in. Depending on where the three boats end up after three phases, money is collected by correct placement of your people. The components (cept for the dice) are top notch and the game is fast and furious. Highly recommended!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fairly simple game of playing the odds. The real game here is blocking your opponents (since each bet can only be taken once), but the first move is auctioned then play proceeds around the table -- which gives a significant advantage to the second player, who pays nothing but sees almost as much choice as the first player. This gives Manilla a strong play order bias.

There are also some unbalanced bets, for example ships are more likely to make it to port than not (and have to be or the game would take forever) but the bets for and against ships making it to port have identical pay tables.

You place bets on which goods will make it to their destinations, how many will, how many won't, and so forth.  The longer you wait to place your bids, the less rewarding they become.  There are also ways that you can tweak the outcome, which can make things a lot more interesting.

Very good game. I like it how it mimics getting more and more in debt when you're trying to get greedy. Sort of reflects the current state of usa today (2008/2009). But, beside that fact, it's a nice enjoyable game to see who can manage his money well, while anticipating any obstacles that might come his way (pirates, boats not making it to Manila, etc).  Very interactive between players, as everyone wants piece of the action. The game doesn't bore either, because there's constantly something going on that you have to have your eye one. Very enjoyable game. Would love to play it more.

"Eurogambling". Almost everything depends on the whims of the dice, with huge swings of luck.

This game has top notch components.  It is pretty, and fairly easy to teach.  There is a variety of play, as well as sophistication in various trade-offs.  It has "Pirates" and "Insurance".  The play reminds me a lot of the gambling game of Craps...

It is not in my top game group because the theme does not interest many of my game group players.  It also has some "analysis paralysis" potential, and the ability to quickly get players behind to where they have no ability to catch up.  

For players who like the financial aspect, I would recommend Union Pacific.

It shouldn't take 20+ minutes to figure this game out, but the rules were dense and convoluted. Beyond that, the game is almost like roulette or a drag race--players make speculative bets on whether or not three cargo barges will make it to shore: Will they arrive? Will they get lost? Players can board the barges to partake in the bounty of the valuable cargo, if it is delivered safely. Players also can attempt to manipulate the barges' speed, albeit only very slightly, or they can attempt to hire pirates to plunder the cargo on the barges for themselves. A player could elect to insure the barges, betting they will arrive safely, but if they don't he/she pays the cost to replace them. In every case, each player has a limited number of "workers" to place. Bidding for harbor master is intense, as this allows the winning player to determine what goods will be brought in, and also allow them to buy a share, in a mini stock market, speculating what goods will be delivered the most. The only disappointing aspect was that this was a barge race, with the speed of each barge based on a die roll. But, like gambling, the winning player will hedge his/her bets, as nothing is for certain with Lady Luck. Interesting choices all around for a fast, furious game, that is accessible, much like Niagara, with a similar feel (or is it the box art?). The components are top notch, especially the hefty, solid plastic resin coins--impressive.

I felt that there are a few things that are really important in this game, and the rest of it really doesn't matter or you better get lucky.  Having the right stock colors was way important.  We played with three, which allowed the other two to snub my color and really put me down.  Wasn't fun.

UPDATE: Played with five, this made the stock colors important still, but not the most important.  Most important was to get lucky.  Still didn't have much fun.

Initially I loved this German dice game but the shine wore off pretty quickly. Whatever the situation some bets are hugely more attractive than others so you don't want to be seated to the left of a player (or two) who's uninterested in becoming harbour master. It almost works, but not quite.

Improved by playing the rule correctly that you place 1 token each, roll THEN place the second token, roll, etc. Still haven't played the insurance office correctly. If you never bid high enough to be Harbormaster it's dull. The money is awful and all looks alike --borrow something from another game if playing in anything but bright sunlight or you'll mix it up. Some satisfaction in pulling off the pirate from time to time.

Lovely components and lots of fun. This game was good while it lasted but now I feel like I'm pretty much done with it.

Ultimately, the stocks mechanism does not integrate well with the rest of the game and is also unbalanced with luck of the initial draw being quite important. Without the stocks the game is exciting at first, but repetitive soon after.

Perhaps some good variant can take this to greatness?

RATING: 7
Quite a fun game of gambling and risk assessment 

Makes a great gateway game or family game and plays like a light middle weight. Luck plays a big role but is no problem for this kind of game and one of this length (60 to 90 minutes).  

I recommend shortening the game a bit if playing with 5, easiest way to do this is by starting the commodities up one spot in the market from the start of the game. Probably best with 5 but still good with 4 and even 3 in a pinch. We played with blind bidding for harbour master and felt it suited the game more than incremental bidding. We also like the variant of removing someone from the ship with the pirate on second roll.

I love strategy games and I love very fun games, but they rarely go together as well as Manila does it. I've played with 3, 4, and 5, but I'm not sure how this plays best yet. And we played wrong with 3 players, we used only 3 pawns as opposed to 4, so that have made a difference. But I'm sold on the 4 and 5 players games, I'm not sure which is better yet. All in all, a very fine game with excellent components that I can highly recommend.

I know Josh disagrees with me but I kept thinking of Lucky Loop when I played this. Both have dice rolling and essentially placing bets, but I like Lucky Loop better. Manila seems to have a catch the leader problem... the key to the game is getting the most shares (sure, the right shares), and that takes money. In addition to getting a share of stock, you also get to choose which companies are going to sail as well as a head start for the company you have the most shares in.

Rating after one play:

This is a really neat game that shows its age a bit. It's one of those "old school" Euros that seem a lot more complicated while you're explaining it than it is to play.

The auction is pretty cut-throat, actually. It's definitely tough for new gamers to value the harbormaster role. I might look into some of the different non-auction variants (but I really like the auction!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Underrated, Manila is a race betting game that will have players risking their money carefully while cheering the boats, sometimes the pirates, and always the dice.  We pull this game out with non-gamers, and its always a hit.  Camel Up, a game many people rate highly, has a very similar feel.  But Manila is slightly more strategic.  There is some method to the dice madness, which means more times than not, understanding the risks is key.  All in all, a good race betting game.

I've played this a couple of times now and I really like it.  The auction for harbormaster is neat and so is the placement.  It really feels great when one of your longshot bets come in like a pirate bet.

RATING: 7
Usually I don't care for this sort of speculative wagering game, but Manila was surprisingly fun.  The differences between this and Winner's Circle for me are that there are more possible wagers, increasing the chance that some wagers at least will pay off; and that the probable results of the action rounds are more easily calculated.  For me that dramatically increases the fun factor.

Group reaction to the game was lukewarm to strong dislike by a couple of players.  Possible for big luck-based swings in fortunes, especially with the Pirate.  The Insurance Office seemed under-powered in our game and was never used (I can see it could be used if first set of dice rolls were all high). The heart of the game is weighing up odds, choices often seemed routine.  Several rounds players were left with no position worth placing an accomplice.  The bid value of the Harbour Master is difficult to assess at different stages of the game - which is good.  However, if the person to your left consistently values it above other players and is Harbour master a lot then this will mean you have a hard time with little choice as to roles and paying higher amounts to get on the boats.  I liked enough to play again, but in no rush to do so.

It's an ok gambling/investing game in which players bid for the right to acquire shares and attempt to influence the stock market by moving the chosen stocks up in market value through dice rolls.

Speculation, gambling and probability math as three boats with wares traverse a river using dice. Quality of components is very good. Beautiful boats, meeples and plastic coins.

It's a pretty straightforward betting game, yet it felt "fresh" and new to me, I don't think I've ever seen the things that this game does. There's a lot of things going on, a lot of different things to bet on. I like the tension that can occur between "temporary-yet-competing allies" - when you and someone else will both profit from a boat arriving, so you join forces to coax it in. It's absolutely beautifully produced. Very exciting game, you can feel the energy crackle every time the dice are tossed, followed by subsequent groans or cheers.

Players are given cards printed with various goods that are used for scoring at the end of the game. Then players bid to see who will select three of the four ships that each carry a type of good for that round. That player also does an initial move of the ships and that player can buy another goods card. Players place pawns either on ships or in various spots on the board that can give them coins at the end of the round. Dice are rolled to move the ships. The ships that complete their journey increase the scoring track for those particular goods. At the game end the number of goods cards are multiplied by the values on the scoring track and added to coins to see who the winner is. There is some strategy, but the dice seem to have a major influence. It is fine as a light filler game.

Franz-Benno Delonge is (was) my favorite author. His games are of an astonishing variety and Manila is no exception. It is unique in the way it combines auctioning, investing in ships, betting on the outcome and a simple dice mechanism. Nonetheless, I was a bit disappointed when I played this a second time about four years after my first play. Probably, nostalgia set my expectations too high. It’s a decent game but a good initial draw of shares or lucky rolls can determine the game to a degree that can render the best efforts obsolete.  If you can live with randomness and don’t mind a bit of nastiness, this can be fun for the whole family while still leaving enough decisions to make it feel worthwhile. Just don’t take it too serious.

This one, with its dice/gambling mechanism, is refreshingly different to the other Euro games we own. It's a great mixture of luck and playing the odds.

One of the most awesome gambling/push-your-luck games I've played in a long time. The river image on the board might as well be green felt with 36 numbers for all the drama and tension it provides.

Players bet on boats, pirates and insurance and must weigh the odds and bet on what pays out the most. Its a fairly simple system which I would probably liken to Titan:Arena (as you get more information, your payout reduces).

Components are crazy beautiful, in particular the coins, even though the coloring is a bit too similar between denominations. Still its a perfect light filler to finish off an evening of gaming.

Looks like a simple race down the river game.  Not!
There are a lot of ways to play this wrong.  The rules aren't laid out the best and if you don't do everything correctly and in the right order the game is messed up.

That said, once you get the procedures figured out its a great bidding and gambling game.  The harbor master is very powerful.

Son muchas opciones que hacer pero todas muy sencillas de comprender. Las reglas se explican en 5 minutillos y en enseguida se aprende la mecánica. El azar es muy elevado, pero es la base del juego ya que son apuestas puras y duras y nunca sabes con seguridad si un barco llegará o no, pero aquí está la chicha del juego y las risas. A parte, los vigías retocan un poco este azar. Por último los piratas le dan un punto muy gracioso al juego. Mucha interaccion entre jugadores. Puede que el azar bastante elevado del juego haga que muchos se echen para atrás a la hora de jugar, pero esto hace que se iguale la experiencia de los jugadores y en una partida con principiantes no esté muy desequilibrada ,por lo que es bastante divertido creo para "no jugones".

Love the theme - makes me want to go out on a ship with merchants in the blue tropical waters.  The only thing I don't like is that there is an immediate intangible benefit to bidding high and winning the role of the harbor master - you don't get the immediate financial pay-off, but you get to go first, which pays off in the end.  It's a fun game that inspires competition while also creating surprises (e.g. when the pirates actually win like 8 times in a game!)

A near-perfect gateway game in it's own way. Worker placement, bidding and risk/reward management in a casual and lucky enough package, so it works with new gamers and you can't always win with experience, but good among gamers too.

I honestly LOVED the fresh system this game has. Very fair and balanced. I DARE say its better than Acquire, but that's just plain crazy talk.  However I do put it on the same side of the fence.  Its nice to play 'another german game' and feel like its something different and fun.  Manila is great!  Maybe after I play it into the ground (like PR, SoC, etc), then I'll change my rating.  But until then, its a solid 10 in my book.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable gambling game of selling blackmarket goods and piracy in which you pay to place pawns that give differing returns dependent on the dice rolls which move the 3 ships.  The key to the game is winning enough auctions to be the harbor master early in the game which allows you to purchase blackmarket goods which have the potential to score huge points in the endgame.  Not a deep strategy game by any means, its a fun romp as long as its played at a decent clip.

I enjoy this unique game which effectively spices up a relatively simple press-your-luck gambling mechanic with an auction and other elements to form a whole that seems greater than the sum of its parts.  The components (particularly the wooden boats) are very well done.  I especially like how the harbor master can control the starting positions of the boats each round.

Manila is, at its core, a gambling game. Thus, it tilts way too heavily on the side of luck. It can still be enjoyed in a relaxed gaming environment and, since anyone can win, it actually works well with game virgins.

RATING: 6.5
(Based on one three player game) An o.k. betting game where you have to keep a keen eye on your return on investment.  Put your money on boats and stock and then send them down the river, if you are going last or have overspent on securing harbour master status then you will soon find yourself up a creek without a paddle.

If this rocks your boat try and get this game for the lowest price possible as a) it will show if you have an acumen for the game and b) at full price in my opinion the return of investment is very low.

Not ideal for three players suggest four as minimum.  A simple amendment which I feel may improve the game is that in the auction for harbour master the first person who passes should go last, and the next person to pass second last etc (this maybe in the rules as we are prone to missing some details but it is worth a go).

Nice worker placement game. Auction at the start is a bit weird as difficult to guess what is a good deal. Pirate mechanism didn't come up that often .

Not sure what is up with the box insert - is printed with the games name but does not fit the pieces intil I looked at ImageID: 2373130 which shows the junks in the 3 slots whereas I was expecting space for the pawns - which is really what you would want to separate

If you're in the mood for chaos this can be a good game with gambling mechanics. You're always playing the odds here sometimes with disastrous consequences sometimes with fantastic profit, all depending on where the dice end up though a couple of players can adjust that a small to moderate amount.

Very good gambling game, easy to learn, fun to play, with the addition of an exciting auction part.

One of my favorites.  This game is like craps, but cooler.  It's a probability based math gamble game, where you bet on the likelihood of boats making it to shore or not, and the probability changes as the dice rolls continue, so spots become more coveted.  Only flaw of this game is that there's a biased to the harbor master (player who goes first each round), but this is determined by the highest bidder, so I drive up the bidding if someone is dominating that. Fun game.

Then, start using the pilots to screw over other people's stocks and boats and it goes to another level.  A whole lot of fun.

3-5p, 60m.  Nautical/pirate theme about smuggling goods into port has an unusual mechanic for a boardgame: though die rolls are what propels the boats, a skillful playing of the odds should usually win.  Lots of enthusiastic comments, and one could dismiss the downers by saying that they don't "get it."
Do not underestimate the power of being the harbormaster (or sitting on their left!)
Only played thrice so far.  At least 2 friends have bought their own copy after playing mine once.  Nice board & bits.

Update March 8 2007: 6 plays so far, still a solid 8.  Great fun when in the mood for this type of game.

Originally: Tentative rating after 2 games.  Very fun game on speculation.  You gamble on aspects of shipping wares to port, from the long-term increase in value of those wares, to betting on how many ships will make it to port (or won't), and so on.  Very fun, fast game.

Manila is an extremely enjoyable, if somewhat luck-dependent game, very similar to craps in many respects.  Every group I've played it with has had a blast--it's got a short learning curve, great bits, and the suspense is thick enough to cut with a knife.

Played only with 5 and, although fun, it seemed there were often little contention for the sweet spots.  Being right before the Harbor Master seems to be an ugly place to be indeed. If you can't be HB, try to be right in front of him/her.

With 5 the boats fill up fast.  It still feels to be that being a pirate is too expensive for the risk with 5.

A neat game which should have won the SdJ instead of Niagra.  A lucky pirate can really swing the game position.  The game is all about risk and managing it.  It reminds me of being at a Casino in some ways.  Very pretty components.

The last game I played was with four players.  On the third die roll all three ships landed on number 13.  Two pirates made out with 45 dollars each...  So there is a bit more luck than I would like at times... but the odds of this occurring are incredibly low.

Very nice take on the risk-taking/investment genre. The only thing I didn't like with the game is that with some die rolls, the last 2 players in the line on the 3rd investment rounds often have nothing good to punt on, as by that time it is obvious where the boats will go (and those investments are already taken). Cool, enjoyable, and short. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is really just a gambling game with a few Euro mechanics to make it worthwhile.  Players are guessing whether or not goods are going to make it to the docks.  When the odds are against you the payout is larger.  Of course if you can get other players to get in on your bets you have a better chance (but then you have to split some of the winnings).  Game probably suffers a bit with repetition but it looks great.

RATING: 8.75
a game that almost always a good time and does not overstay its welcome.  the last roll of the dice each round is exciting.   never let the harbor master go too cheaply with new players to show how important it is.  overbid by a lot to give the new players a feel for the right price.


*********************

this is a fun game and easy enough for non-gamers.   not too much thinking, but it always seems to be very entertaining.

****** Update July 2009 

I think this is an extremely underrated 'gateway' game.  Neat twist on craps and it is a nice way to introduce auctions for turn order (while a little different, vegas showdown might work better) and worker placement.  Game plays fairly quickly.  I recommend starting the share values on zero with any newer players.

Thanks to Jeff Lee for showing us this fun game that deserves more attention. Great gateway game, preferable to Ticket to Ride I think. Many ways to earn victory points, but not as heavy as most games fitting that description. Certainly want to play this more.

Much more interesting than I would think, based on the mechanics. The gambling portion is well and true gambling because of the randomness of the rolls. The stock portion was smaller than I thought or wanted it to be because only one person can buy one share per round. I kept feeling that should have larger. It wasn't a homerun for me.

Surprisingly just plain fun game that essentially has each playing "betting" on the outcome of every potential action. Whether boats make it to harbor or are forced into repairs. Whether pirates will strike. Whether insurance will pay off. Whether extra piloting is needed. And I didn't even mind the die rolling for movement. This is almost a "party" game, being so enjoyable, but there is real strategy, esp. as regards bidding for the all-important harbor master role.

A flawed gem; lots of interesting decisions, but the costing of the options seems a little arbitrary in places.  The worst bit is the pirates, which either do nothing, or win you the game.  Rosie would rather gnaw her leg off than play again, so traded it away.

Fun game, usually very colourful and exciting. It seems that the shares drive the end results - if you get lucky, you can do pretty well even if your game goes down the drain. That's... interesting? But it's a family game, basically, so I'm willing to cut it some slack, because the most important thing, the thrill and excitement of gambling is there.

Indifferent.

Has held up very well over the years I've owned this so far.  It doesn't get the heavy playing it did when I first got it, but it's still requested fairly often and everybody always has a good time.  Some nice long-shot bets that aren't TOO long-shot so you've always got a chance to get back in it.  If you like gambling, dice rolling, money game, this is a great game for you.  Also excellent components - as one friend says, "The best money in all of gaming!"

Really enjoyed my only game so far.  Would like to try this again,  I love the gambling aspect.  Not many games like it.

Second game, not quite like the first.  Felt more random and hard to come back from deficit.  I still like it but I need to try it again.

Finally broke down and bought a copy off a friend's auction. Am I glad I have a copy? Yes. Am I still horrible at it? You betcha.

This didn't grab me as much as I had expected it to. There are so many options, and each of them has a wildly varying effect on subsequent income, that a newcomer will be playing essentially randomly. For now, I have no interest in repeating this, but I could see it's the kind of game that would get better with a group that kept at it for a few sessions.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not sure whether I would call this game a total dice-rolling luckfest, an exercise in clever, calculated risk-taking, or just plain old gambling. But I must admit, it is fun especially if luck is on your side. There are a few things you can do to help influence whether or not your coveted punt (barge) makes it to port but there are no guarantees because the boats are powered by three die rolls.  The game is basically an exercise in guessing what boats will travel the 14 spaces to port.  There are three rounds of placing "workers" and you have more information in later rounds but the prime spots may be gone by the later rounds.  I would say this is a good, light family game and certainly a good game for non-gamers.

The best game with a betting mechanic out there in my opinion. The game consists of several rounds with 'risk vs reward' style decisions. The components are amazing and make for a super fun theme. The game is easy to teach and learn. Luck is a strong part of the game, but making solid decisions plays a large role in deciding the winner. Great, rare, gem of a game.

[b]Avril 2014: 7.4[/b] Agréable expérience. Il s'agit de lire où se situent les meilleures probabilités de gain / de nuisance; et puis hop, on brasse les dés!

[b]Juillet 2017: 6.9[/b] Les dernières parties jouées (toujours à 4 ou 5 joueurs) ont vu un ou deux joueurs être rapidement séparés des deux ou trois autres en termes de probabilité de gain. D'ailleurs, certaines de ces parties n'ont même pas été terminées, par perte d'intérêt de la part de certains / tous les joueurs. Il y a de petits éléments qui semblent ne pas bien fonctionner dans le jeu, créant la situation ci-haut évoquée. Je ne me rappelle plus très bien ce que j'y reprochais exactement (et quelles idées j'avais avancées pour modifier / améliorer l'expérience de jeu), car cela fait déjà quelques temps que je n'y ai pas joué. J'en suis toutefois à revoir certaines notes données à des jeux, aussi j'en profite dès maintenant pour diminuer mon évaluation de Manila à 6.9, soit légèrement plus haut que la moyenne BBG (6.735) ainsi que de la moyenne de mes notes attribuées à divers jeux (6.65).

J'écrirai éventuellement de façon précise ce que je lui reproche ainsi que certaines pistes de solution...

This was published in English about 10 years ago, in a superior edition, but it's long out of print, so importing is your best bet. 

This bidding game is something of a classic, combining worker placement and blind speculation. It tends to be exciting from round to round and even when things seem to be going terribly there are ways to profit from it. Camel Up treads similar ground, less successfully. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun 'harbourmaster' mechanic where you have to bid and cough up for all the goodies and privileges of the position. Putting your pieces down last can narrow what are normally vast options, but in the end, you can always pay up your five whatnots and don your pirate hat and hopefully get to rob a barge full of jade for loot!

Excellently detailed theme and even though I dislike 'economic' games per se, this was soft enough, and playful enough, to take in stride. 

Luck does play a larger role in this game so control freaks may not enjoy this one, but if you're ok with a quirky element of randomness, Manila will be fun to play.

Elegant, simple and with a factor of randomness to make it unpredictably fun.  Many choices and a slightly complicated score system that contributes to making each game different than the others.

Why is this wonderful game still OOP?!?!

Looks like a reprint is coming but the wonderful wooden boats are not going to be in it...sigh.

Update 3:
My girlfriend got a copy for me with the wooden boats for Christmas (yay!!!) and it's back to the Manila love as my current game group also enjoyed it greatly!

It's a great fun game to introduce newbies, but I feel like it has very shallow depth, as there's a limit of variety from game to game.

Fine components, nice betting system but there was something I didn't like in harbor master mechanic. With 5 players there is maybe too much demand for that place and it can happen you're outplayed if you get a bad start. Also, harbor master is getting quite a lot of power as only he can buy the stock and is the first in order to place his men. I like the betting system and the luck element is manageable in the game. Game seems to be better with 4 rather than with 5 players.

I'm going to prefer to start stocks from 0 (or 5 even) to shorten the game a bit as it can in worse case take up to 90 minutes, which is too much for a this sort of a game.

[b]Manila[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]The fact that Manila eventually left our collection was a big surprise to me since we really had fun on our first few plays. Unfortunately we soon found the game to be too long for what it offered; as the game went on we were just going through the motions to get to the end.

I've come to realize that for my family a push your luck game needs to be quick. It is easy to lose interest in a game when you realize that the probability of clawing your way out of the hole you dug yourself into is slim. On top of that the actions you take are straightforward and don't hold up for 60+ minutes. I realize my critiques of the game pertain to what my family enjoys and I think there will be plenty of folks who will enjoy Manila.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- The components are amazing, wooden ships and really nice plastic coins (I have the 1st edition which I was lucky enough to get for a great price).
- Manila is a really fun family game that introduces simple market scoring via set collection combined with deeper push your luck elements.
- "Advanced" push your luck - There are a lot of decisions to be made in this game regarding how far you want to push your luck while still maintaining enough income to be able to pay for specific actions.
- Having to bid for the role of harbormaster adds another layer to managing your money since you want to make sure you get the goods you want on the boats and each round you get to select your actions first. The flip side is not spending a lot of money and just piggy backing on the actions of the Harbormaster and trying to get big payouts each round. 
- A perfect amount of randomness with the dice. Each round the probability of boats reaching port becomes easier to calculate, but you are still at the mercy of the dice and anything can happen. Rather than being a source of frustration it adds a level of excitement to each die roll. 

Manila had been on my radar for a long time, but it had been out of print. With the reprint coming out I almost got a copy, but I really wanted to get the first edition with the awesome production. I'm glad I waited, but this is an excellent game and would recommend getting either edition especially if you have a group that would enjoy a meatier push your luck game. [/i]

Nice bits and clever theming attempts to disguise what is nothing but a gambling game. Make decisions based on no information except risk possibilities, watch other players pus me, and then see how it all pans out without further input. You can take the safe bets on which ships will make it to the harbour or not (ie will the dice be favourable or not) and make marginal (ie non-winning) income, or you can go for some more risky bets in an attempt to win the game. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes not. Not a game I want to invest time in. I traded it away.

After 1 play:  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Luck dominated nastiness that seemed to go on for *ever*.  I usually lke Franz-Benno Delonge's designs but this really annoyed me for some reason.

*I think this is best when played with the variant that lets pirates board punts at the end of roll 2 if the land on space 13 AND the boat is already full.

People hollering, groaning in defeat from bad die rolls, smashing fists down on tables.  I can't think of another game that matches this experience.

Serious good game. I love that this is a commodities game, mixed with a lot of gambling. Fantastic components. 

If desired, you CAN shorten it by starting the shares one spot higher.

Beat Ken (142 to his 139) 10/15/09. Much drinking, yelling and furious table banging.

*I've made some small custom value cubes. They show the value of stocks clearly vs the discs that can slide around and then you don't know where the values are. These I find very helpful.

The mechanics are simple, you pay to place your meeples in different places and if you bet correctly, you gain more money then you paid. You are betting on whether three ships will make it to the end after three dice rolls, however others can influence their movement and betting early is advantageous. Plus they carry goods which you own shares in that also bring money. A very cute game that is a lot of fun, for gamers or family and friends.

Fun but random. When I played this the first time, the other players didn't like it as much as I did, perhaps because I did so badly and then had two spectacular pirate hauls, to win the game after all. It was on the long side for such a light game, but I think this will be good with fast players that don't take the game too seriously.

Would like to play again.

A heavily luck dependent game, which despite that proved to be quite nice way to spend time.
There aren't too much room for strategy when the dice roll.

The components look nice and function well. Only the colouring of the money is a bit bad, but it's only an issue when trying to peak the money piles of the others.

Not a bad game at all, I'd easily play more on this. If only the playing time were even a bit shorter... even a bit...

I want to like this game more.  Shipping goods, pirates, boat races, betting and bidding:  it sounds like it should be great.  In practice, the right-player binding is distressingly terminal once the harbor-master job slips away from you the first few times.  I also think it would work best with 4 players only.  3 seems too few, 5 too many.

There is a lot of luck in this game! But it should be a given if you know this game is at the mercy of the dice rolls. I got lucky the first game where I trailed for a bit but the last round I've made quite a fortune by being on both ships that made it. The game will be more tactical once everyone knows how to play the game. I will adjust the ratings accordingly once I have more games under my belt.

Now I don't mind games with an element of risk, but when it comes to high risk speculation on a die roll I just feel the odds are against me. Sure there are situations in and around the Port of Manila to compensate such unpredictability, but the amount of calculation involved (for my brain) is undermined by that die, I mean I nearly won the game because I was lucky being the pirate on the third roll. Comments that this should have been a horse race are justifiable, in fact such a game exists called Royal Turf which for me is a better speculation.

I traded for Manila because it sounded like a good, light gambling game of the same ilk as Winner's Circle. After one play, I'm not sure. It's almost a great family game, but then it has a really important, hard to value auction every round. And because you only roll one die at at time, you can't do very interesting things to manipulate the probabilities. It looks great though and I'd like to try it again soon.

RATING: 7
A very fun game to play but not really a strong 7 rating. One 4-player game where we started the share values at 0 rather than 'sub-zero'. The game is much easier to play than the rules read (an error on the Insurance summary says 'wharf' when 'shipyard' is meant). The bits are very good and defintely raise the rating. Where the game falls down for me isn't so much the luck factor but with the mostly obvious choices as to where to place 'accomplices'. Too many of the locales were almost never selected (maybe the 4th meeple should be used in all games). I also think that using JeffMyers suggestion for 'harbor master' allocation (given to the poorest player) or just moving it around the board as (first player) in Louis XIV etc. is in better alignment with the light-hearteness of this pretty game. Further play supports this suggestion as otherwise there is a rich-get-richer tendency that could put this game rating down to a low-6.

Pretty decent family game. Some people will complain about the randomness but it makes the game more animated and fun, instead of being a stale and calculated Euro. This is essentially a betting game (like a horse race) with more betting options, ships that make it to the goal, ships that don't make it, in which order etc. I did enjoy it but I felt that I had limited control about what was going on most of the time.

I wanted to like this game more. I like the variable starting locations and having the choice of which product actually makes the trip. The different choices for the outcomes, including both extremes, is a good touch, along with the pirate.

What I don't like about it, as is common, is the randomness the dice brings. What can look like all three boats finishing can turn into only one.

RATING: 6.25
This game is far too random.  A few lucky pirate plunders, especially early on, can lead to insurmountable domination.  The game felt like there weren't enough options and not enough turns to see a wide variance in the outcomes of those choices.  The dice were fine, but I'd like to have seenan expanded version of the game with more boats, more resources, a longer track, and a greater depth of selections.  Despite all of that, the game seemed fun, so I'd try it again to refine my opinion.

This is Gambler, the euro gamer game.  Lots of press your luck  and you can really get aggressive to get a big pay out but most of the time you don't pull that off so you have to invest your people and money wisely to get the best pay out.  I'm still not sure if this is an investment game or a gambling game but one thing I know is that I'm not very good at it but despite that fact, i still really like this game as it plays fairly fast (1 hour) yet satisfying.

RATING: 6
A game of playing the odds and making wagers as boats race to their goal.  Players get to play a variety of simultaneous betting games - Try to push up the value of your goods?  Bet on a delivery?  Bet on a failure?  Try to swindle someone else's fortunes?  Each has a fixed cost and payout, but the odds of success change after each roll of the dice.  But there is another round of wagering as the information increases.

A nice package overall with a single concern - it is very difficult to come from behind in this game - really need to stay with the leaders.  Of course, a lucky break might occur - so the game is often more decided on the roll of the dice than the skill of the players.  But still a fun warm-up game if not taken to seriously.  Play it with a lighter attitude and the game can be a fun ride.  (Initial rating might have been a 7 - but I find I tend to be optimistic on the initial plays, so have knocked this down to a 6.  Further plays will determine how the rating might change.)

Wow. Love this game after one play. Don't think I'd ever get tired of it. It took me over six months to get to it, because I couldn't assimilate the rules, but if you're working with people who know how to play, it's nearly a non-issue. 
Skilled players can calculate probabilities, plan for possibilities, claim opportunities, and still lose out to lousy dice rolls -- but your palms will be sweating all the way. 

In the end, though, I knocked this down a full point. I don't mind push-your-luck games, but the sell-everything-to-dictate-cargo mentality is morbidly un-fun.

beautiful, rich themed betting game with a HUGE deal of luck. A typical family game that had, according to Bruno Faidutti and others, Spiel des Jahres written all over it [Obviously it didn't win. ;-)]. Great, lighthearted fun, with some tough decisions (calculating or guesstimating probabilities). Clearly better than Can't Stop, Liars Dice, Royal Turf (which are of the same genre).

Impressions after reading the rules: Delightful uncertainty in this euro. I'm typically not one for bidding and counting odds but there's definitely some charm here. I can see players having to place their 'accomplices' or workers  with trepidation. The fact that the barges move after everyone has placed a worker and you do this three times makes for tense play. In other bidding games the random factor is something that encourages memory and calculation. Here the odds - the dice - are always the same.

I parted with this because of the competition it got on our shelf for the player count and time investment. I still look back on the betting of Manila as great design that I would love to see tried more.

This game just does not work for me. I will play if asked, but I would never suggest it. The lucky pirate scoring really tips the game.

10/27/07 Edit: Manila was Game of the Month this month, and I missed playing it because I kept showing up late, but I saw it a lot and wanted to give it another shot. I finally played it last Thursday. I thought I was doing badly, but ended up winning. I did get a lucky shot (about 1-in-3) in the last round, but I'd missed several 1-in-3 chances earlier that game so I guess it evened out. 4 is a little harsh, I'm going to up my rating of this game.

After 1 play: I find this kind of thing frustrating. I know not all games can be 'no chance' or 'perfect information,' but I really, REALLY hate getting super-shafted when I make generally decent bets and then lose - I never win long shots, but I often seem to lose the "sure things".

This is why I don't frequent Las Vegas.

The game has some interesting stuff, but I don't want to play it... so I'll give it a 4.

My initial rating for this game would have been a 7.  However, further playing of the game has exposed some areas of concern.  The biggest problem is the massive amount of chaos in the game.  You can play reasonably well in this game and do horribly if things just go against you repeatedly.  That is not inherently a bad thing -- unless you want to have a little more control.  The other more personal problem is the need to guess how to deploy your pieces which to come extent requires some guesstimation of what your opponents will do.  I have problems with these types of games in general.  The chaos in this game makes it even more difficult and takes some of the enjoyment out.  [01-01-2009]

This game looks really good laid out on a table. The bits include the best looking coins I've seen and the color of the ocean is accented beautifully by the ships. Beyond that we have an auction/gambling game semi-controlled by dice. It has a light feel and fun mechanics that have everyone feeling involved in almost everything that happens. New players will probably underestimate the value of the harbor master early in the game when cheap stocks can be a real bargain. The theme makes this game a lot of fun to play.

[1 play] I liked this game even a bit better than I expected. I thought it would be really luck dependent based on reading the rules, however, although dice are a factor, skilled management of your actions and good auction skills are going to win far more often than not. This is a fun and fairly rapid game.

Interesting elements. Theme is a paste on. I never felt like I was smuggling goods into Manila. Heck, do smugglers dress in garish colours? The game combines auctions with role choices as well as the usual mechanics for VPs (stocks being worth more if boat gets into Manila). Players given alot of options per turn. But it goes a little long for what it is and felt like a rinse and repeat sort of game. Review coming. GREAT looking bits though.

I don't typically enjoy betting, or games that feature a lot of luck, so I was somewhat surprised that I liked this game as much as I did. There is certainly more control here than in something like Pirate's Cove. In fact, there is quite a bit of depth in the auction and in judging probabilities. Nice components too!

After two plays (4 and 5 player).  Very random, but I found it fun.  Five player seemed more interesting because it became even more important to go early in the turn order and thus made the initial bidding more lively.

Economic, Gambling, Auction. After several plays, still really enjoying Manila. It feels like quick fun with a little gambling, yet it goads you to strategize to make the most of your pesos and invest wisely to come out ahead, and the stock auction is crucial. Good stuff.

EDIT: bumping rating down a half point after further plays. Still a fun game, but the pirate seems too lucky.

Last EDIT: bumped back up to 8. I find the use of the pirate is sometimes more balanced than I thought. Still a fun game.

It was an interesting game that didn't take too long.  Perhaps this game can actually handle three to five players well.  It's essentially a betting game that uses some dice to influence the boat race theme.  Yea, dice!  I guess dice and betting go together like, uh...  Craps, I can't think of anything.

Szép, részvényes, kockás, könnyed, mégse mondanám családinak. Nehéz besorolni a Manilát. A játékosok körönként a kikötőmesteri címért szállnak harcba. A kikötőmester dönt három hajó indulásáról és arról ezek a hajók milyen részvények emelkedését érhetik el, ha bejutnak a kör végén a kikötőbe. 4 részvény van a játékban, körönként három hajó indul, így mindig egy részvény kimarad. A bejutott hajók növelik az adott részvény értékét. A játékban fogadni lehet arra hány hajó jut be és marad hoppon és a hajókon utazók bejutás esetén különböző pénzmennyiséget osztanak el egymás között egyenlő arányban. Tehát ebből, illetve a játék végén a részvényekből van bevétel. A hajók előrejutást sima kockadobás dönti el, így kimondottan nagy a szerencse szerepe. Igazán családinak viszont kicsit azért a részvények miatt nem nevezném. Amúgy számomra ez a szerencse még bele is fért volna, viszont a játék kezdetén kapott két véletlenszerű részvény már zavart. Főleg, mert a játékban a részvények adják az össz pénzünk kicsit több, mint felét, ezért ezen nagyon sok múlik. Nem katasztrófa játék a Manila, de valahogy nekem a részvény és a nagy szerencse nem fér össze. Szerintem ebből a hajókázásból lehetett volna jobbat is kihozni.

Manila is just pure fun.  It has a certain spark that other enjoyable games don't have.  Perhaps it's the gambling mechanic.  The dice work really well here by adding heaps of tension and excitement to the game.  There's a tiny bit of Caylus here too with the placing of your accomplices (workers) each round.  I love the fact that players are often "driven to piracy" due to a lack of other profitable choices.  Just very, very cool.

Looking at the rulebook might be intimidating!  Don't get discouraged, and believe the comments.  Manila is a very simple game, but the rulebook makes it look FAR more complicated than it really is.  And don't mistake simplicity for lack of depth.  The rules are simple, but the depth is there as well!  Fantastic.

I'm still a bit lukewarm towards this game, though the second time I played it, it was better. It's an auction/gambling game. You bid to be the one who gets to buy extra shares and decides what goods will be shipped. Try to make sure that goods you have shares in make it to the harbour because your shares will rise in value. You can gamble how many boats will and will not make it to the harbour. Or take a risk and become a pirate and get all...or nothing at all.
It's fun playing, but I don't feel satisfied when the game ends. It's too random. The best player is not necessarily the winner. Most likely it's the last player who seized a ship as a pirate. This gets you a lot of money, unbalancing the auction and the rest of the game.

"Craps in Boardgame form", and a gambler's delight.  Being that I like a bit of gambling myself, I really, really enjoy this one.  The unpredictability makes for great fun, and the secret objectives of not completely knowing what your opponents have adds to it.  This is a gem of a game, and one that I'm glad to have in my collection.

UPDATE: After many memorable plays, it's the perfect balance of risk and reward, a wonderful amount of unpredictability that makes is a true classic.

I like dice, and Manila uses them in the right way. However, it's a bit of an odd beast, since the game is principally about the auctions, not about placing pawns and trying to get the boats to land. It's a bit too long for what it is. At 45-60 minutes, I would give this a higher rating, but games of 90+ minutes are alas no exception.

With this game and Camel Up, you have everything you need to get your kids into gambling!  This game is just so much fun.  I love chucking dice, placing bets, pushing my luck... it's a great time for people who can laugh at the fickle whims of Lady Luck!  The one thing that really bugged me about the game is that the Harbor Master gets to do everything, which for me places too much weight on that Harbor Master auction.  I enjoy the game a lot more when I can spread the fun around with my variant rules (available in the Files section).

RATING: 4
Light gambling game, with all that implies: large luck factor, virtually no control, just high and low risk bets.

Pasted-on theme, but who cares. Nice components. 

--

Five years later: Hadn't played this in a long time and enjoyed it about as much as I remembered. Bizarre auction-stockholding-gambling-worker placement game where three boats move up a track into a harbour. Players pay to place their minions on various different spaces, such as on the boats (rewarded if they make it to the harbour) or in the harbour itself. There are various different degrees of risk and reward on offer, but the progress of each boat is ultimately decided by three dice rolls.

I really don't like it. Ultimately it's a game of betting on the outcome of random die rolls, but it feels even more random than it actually is because it has the trappings of a strategy game. The stockholding element is just more randomness when stock values are so difficult to manipulate (you're sunk if you're dealt two of the same stock and the dice go against you), exclusivity of spaces punishes players later in turn order etc.

The gorgeous components don't make up for the lack of theme. Frankly I think this is a style of game that just works best with races and I would never choose Manila over Royal Turf or even Camel-Up.

The fact that we were all essentially sitting around betting on how a series of dice rolls were going to turn out came glaring through to me.  I'm not sure exactly why this detracted from my enjoyment, but that's how I felt about it.  Maybe another play with an increased appreciation for the value of paying to be "harbor master" (and thus choosing which three of the four colors will be put into play in each round) will give me a better insight into the possibility that smart decisions will make the game interesting.

RATING: 8
[Zoch 2005 edition] {Nautical, economic, gateway; stock holding, bidding, roll-and-move; optimal 4-5p} Manila is an exceptional family game. The smuggling theme integrates excellently with the game (it'd be even funnier if you find some props for the habour master and pirates :laugh: ).  Players are engaged by the game.  In addition, the bits are very attractive and durable; esp. the money tokens.

The rules are clearly illustrated except the rule for successful voyage - I spent some time to make sure that a successful voyage means arriving ** on or past ** 13. We always play with the variant that the pirates can force accomplices off the punt at the second roll. Besides, we disallow players placing accomplices to a punt that already parked the wharf.  In addition, encumbered stocks have 0 value at game end and players to pay off the loan of all encumbered stocks (subtract 15 PESOS).

Manila has very good player interaction and is very dynamic. It is full of joys and excitement in the bidding, betting, dice-rolling and the pirates. The game time is just right (normally within an hour) and it has little down time.  You can use another variant (price of commodity starts at 0) to have shorter game. Players won't feel bored with consecutive plays.

Though dice are involved, the luck is quite balanced by bidding and placements of accomplices. It is about calculation and risk taking - one has to calculate a move that maximizes the * expected * gain. The most critical luck that I experienced is the initial drawing of commodity card; usually, it's disadvantageous to have a pair of commodity initially.  

Players don't need an excellent strategy in this game because most moves are tactical and simple.  Nevertheless, bidding of habour master requires more brain exercises - usu. winner is the one who bid the habour master early.  The EV of the habour master should deteriorate in the late game because there is usually superfluous money; as a result, bidding price is usually higher than necessary. I don't think habour master is over-powered because one has to spend a lot to bid for the harbour master; thus, one can't always be the harbour master. Furthermore, there are other ways to gain money and raise the price of a commodity.

It is not trivial in buying a stock and placing the punts. 5-4-0 is NOT the most common way we place the punt. Picking which commodity to load may be trivial, though.  One should be careful in buying stocks - the best strategy is to let other player help you raise the price of commodity.  It's not cost-effective to raise stock price by being a habour master.

Love Manila. It is a gambling/investment type game. You try to play the odds to gain the most money. As the end nears, there is more cheering and jeering for that last roll. Will your Pirate pay off and you will steal a Jade shipment. 

The auction mechanism is difficult to judge for first time players, but it forces someone to unload cash for privileges every round, for good or ill.

Played 3+ times.  It's all about mitigating risk and influencing the final values of your shares.  The dice have a very direct effect on the outcome of the game.  You roll 3D6 for each boat and it needs somewhere between 14 and 9 to cross the finish line and payout.  There are only about 5 to 10 races, so not a lot of time to balance out the luck. I don't normally like much randomness in my games, so I don't really enjoy this. 2010/03/19

I found this game amazingly frustrating, but quite enjoyable at the same time.  The mechanic is easy and fun, but I always felt like I was having to settle for the second best option (until I decided to bid high and become the harbour master!).

tl;dr: nice, but a bit more control would be nice

Each round players spend money to place followers in locations they hope will give them more money than they invested. Then dice are rolled and stuff happens. This can lead to pretty tense situations, but for the most part stuff is out of your control. If you're fine with that, this game can be good fun. If not, you might end up mostly frustrated.

It`s important to bid for the captain - you decide what 3 of 4 goods will shipped, you can buy a good, and you place your workers first. But you don`t need to be captain, to win. If you pay too much for the captain, it`s better to be not the captain.

Manila!  There's a lot of randomness to this one, but there's strategy too, and it's one of those games that has a little something for everybody.  Some friends of mine that are business-types like the whole concept of the 'investment' in the various options on the board, whereas the gamblers love to go for the high-risk-high-reward spaces like the pirates.  One thing anyone teaching the game needs to emphasize is the benefit being the harbor master is sort of three-fold - most people understand placing first, but may not understand the strategy of choosing (and biasing) wares or the importance of buying a share.  Thus, new players often undervalue the harbor master role.

Very good! The mechanism was fresh and original, I've never played a game like this before. Interesting and challenging right til the end. I usually HATE luck oriented games but in this one luck is exactly what it's all about: it's about how you can make sure you don't suffer too much of your bad luck, it's about optimizing your risks! You think you got bad luck with dice? Fine: bet that none of the boats arrive at harbour when it's your turn to cast the dices! It's betting game! I'll be probably buying this someday myself (and did).

One of the few titles from Nuremburg in '05 that has really caught my attention. Luck does play a large roll - it's driven by dice, after all - but the strategies and decisions offered to players outweigh any downside caused by swings in luck. Solid, replayable and enjoyable, especially for anyone who is interested in gambling odds. Invest your money in this one rather than giving it to a casino :) ... Update: Rating downgraded from 8 to 7. This game is admittedly a bit unbalanced; the rich can get richer and a single lucky pirate strike can salt away a victory. I still enjoy the game, but the lack of balance has really annoyed folks in my game group and it's hard to get anyone to play this :(

RATING: 6
Feels pretty much like roulette, is a bit repetitive, and slightly outstays its welcome. It's hard for new players to work out how much to bid to be the Harbourmaster. Outcome is prone to luck, particularly whether or not the pirates come into play. Components are excellent. Initial rating of 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good gambling game with possibly the most attactive components I have ever seen from box/insert to the board to the game pieces.  An excellent job by Rio Grande.

A simple odds game with a few wrinkles and a theme bolted on that take this from the level of a game like Can't Stop to something more along the lines of The Adventurers. It works very well and I have always had success introducing it.

Plays best with more players.

Update:  Rating stays the same.  This is a good gambling game with awesome components.  I still enjoy this one, but if it had the components of a Cheapass game, I doubt I'd play it.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1

While it plays a little long at first (it speeds up as people appreciate the options), this is mostly a game of gambling for position in varyingly risky slots, with a dash of push-your-luck since those slots are so scarce.

RATING: 7.5
Manila is a unique gem - A hybrid of betting, bidding, share holding and worker placement, where the theme is smuggling contraband into the Philippines.

At its most basic level, players are rolling dice and betting on the success of boats travelling into Manila, laden with smuggled goods. Simple.

But the mixture of mechanisms that surrounds this is unique and brilliant. You start with shares in each good. Then, at the start of a round, you bid to be harbour master, which grants you a set of powerful privileges. These include being able to buy more shares, and a set of abilities which can help you rig the round. 

Players then place their bets via worker placement, and roll dice to send the punts down the river - putting workers on punts to make a direct bet, or else betting on broader race outcomes. A successful punt travels 13 spaces, sending the share price of that good up, and paying out to anyone who bet on it.

The game is definitely on the lighter side; There is luck in the die roll, and that can make it both forgiving and frustrating. But for people who like to play the odds this is just lovely.

Manila is a wonderful game. The components are fantastic, of the best in any game I own, and it looks gorgeous set up on the table. Even though I don't play it that often, it is definitely one of the standout games in my collection, one I would never part with.

This is my second Zoch game after Nigara. Zoch boardgames are usually with great appearance. There is no exception for Manila. I like games with chance, betting and wagering. Manila is about wagering in heart, but nicely themed and blended with commodity market manipulation. Do you not get scared when you lose your first game. You need to play it a couple of times to learn a better valuation on the jobber positions and auction strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun and original family game, which does take some time to explain because of all the different investment options. Basically it has a bit of a casino feel: You can opt for safe investments with a low return or risky investments with a high return. The best part of the game is that you can threaten the investments of others by taking up certain positions on the board. Because of its variable end game condition, the game can definitely overstay its welcome, but it is an original title for anyone's collection. Components are great (as expected from Zoch).

RATING: 6
I demoed this game at Origins 05.  I tend to like games like Diamant, Cloud 8, Circus Flocatti, and other "Push your luck" games, but this one did not catch me. In those games, there is a single, simple goal that gets closer to success, but that could fail at any time. In this game, success or failure comes at the end of the race, and not before, so it doesn't feel like the same type of game to me.  It is also similar to Royal Turf in that it is a race that relies on luck, and you can place your bids in several places to hedge your bets.  Unfortunately, the simplicity of those games is lost due to having so many elements to bet on. 

It is a neat game, though. First it is especially beautiful, like other Zoch games. The variety of options didn't work for me, but that is probably a feature for others.

Speculate on the outcomes of goods shipments arriving to Manila. A dice "wagering" game in which players place their "agents" (cute conical-hatted pawns) to take possession of various betting options. While outcomes are determined by dice rolls, players maintain a fair level of control as the game is all about risk management and playing the odds. An underlying share speculation/"harbor master" auction component ends up being key to getting a good score in the game - understanding their impact may take a few games for some players. Components and production value are top notch. Excellent "gateway" level game and great value for the price!

Lots of luck but also some skill. Basically gambling but you can noticeably influence the odds and also determine the odds for certain moves. So sometimes you get real bargains and sometimes you make real longshots. The key is that you can very rarely be 100% sure about the outcome. And this is where and why this game shines with new and casual gamers.

Very fun game! There's always time for dice and it makes it go very well. I find that I tend to get less excited at the end than at the beginning. I think that it is perhaps a  round or two too long. Oh and I never win!

2008-05-14 - Rating 7.25 -> 6.5; This is fun but only for a few rounds and then it gets too repetitive.
2008-08-16 - I like it better when it can be played within 45 min; It's an ok game but I am not that good at betting games.
2016-08-15 - Bought BoardGameBliss
2016-08-29 - Rating 6.5 -> 7.5; playing with family makes it more fun. This edition, with the cardboard punts and cardboard money are much worse than the beautiful and lavish plastic punts and coins that came with the earlier edition. Playing with poker chips makes dealing with money easier and allows for faster gameplay.

Bidding and gambling - not my favorite elements in games. I have played this now twice. The game itself is quite light, but too light compared to the length. Bidding and gambling are elements which are quite hard for the first-timers and/or non-gamers, so this game is not something which I would pick for casual gaming. And for serious gaming the game is too light. Not a bad game necessarily, but not for me. The theme is nice, but there are some illogical things, that don't work with the mechanics. Quite pretty.

Push your luck with an element of stock-holding, Manila is fun if a bit odd. At the very least start the stock markers on the '0' space, otherwise the game is too long for what it is (last time we started them on the '5' space and felt that winning the auction at the beginning of each round became too important, so '0' it is).

Barges, freight and profits are what it's all about in Manila, a speculative contest for 3 to 5 players 10 and up. Goods shipments, intended for transport along sea routes, are in danger of gathering dust in the warehouses or being lost at sea in a storm. While the players speculate about success and failure, the ultimate fate of the ships will be determined by the dice. This game includes a new innovation in game design: The Franz-Benno Delonge design will include, in addition to the usual paper rules, include an interactive CD-ROM version as well. The English Rio Grande Games edition does not include the CD-ROM. Category: Transportation, Nautical;  Mechanics: Commodity Speculation, Auction/Bidding, Betting/Wagering, Dice Rolling; Note: the variant described at the end of the published rules -- allowing pirates to displace previous passengers in order to board a punt -- is the preferred way to play for most BGG users.

RATING: 7
This is a tense, cutthroat little game that totally overcomes its association with a publisher renowned for kids' games.  In fact, I don't see this as much of a kids' game at all.  Players are trying to collect the most money over three rounds, either by delivering goods, owning stock, predicting the placement of ships, or by pirating the ships to collect their bounty.  The higher the payoff, the higher the risk, and the players have to decide which direction to take each turn to ensure that they collect the most money.  The best actions are ones that give you money by taking money from other players, but good luck getting that to happen.  More often than not, players are going to be playing to protect their investments.  I'm not surprised that this is a game designed by the same guy who did Container.

Falling fast for me, not for what it is but for the huge missed opportunity. It's a fine family game, but backprint the map (a la Power Grid), double the number of roles for your workers and throw in some layered bets, bets tying up workers for multiple turns, etc., and you could easily have a much deeper gambling game for gamers. And now I can't play it without feeling this absence.

This is one of the most underated games, IMHO. All this game is about is economics and speculation, thus a great game (see the stock and future markets). In Manila you can even hedge your position when playing at the insurance house. Perfect! As the harbour master you are an insider trader, and you pay (or bribe) for the assymetric information. WOW!
Everything runs smooth and it's really fun when the pirate pays off.

One play of this game with 3 players. I genuinely have no idea why this game is so highly rated and so sought after. Aside from the auction to move the boats and be the first to place, it feels like there is very little game here. You place bets, collect payoffs if events resolve in your favor, then repeat this process until the game ends. I would rather outmaneuver other players then try to beat the odds of the game. It doesn't help that it is very easy to exactly calculate all of the probabilities involved in the betting.

Wow. What a great game. Lots of interesting choices and decisions. Luck management, but still rewards good decisions. Deliciously wicked action at times. My only dislike was the arbitrary targeting of players (especially early in the game when folks are roughly equal in standing) by the pirate -- when you have to screw someone hard, for no apparent reason. It's hard to justify picking one player over another under those circumstances w/o resorting to  metagame influences.

Not exactly a big gambling fan myself, I did found the speculation placement aspect to be an interesting one.  Unfortunately, I think the negative impact of the luck factor greatly outweighed any fun it was suppose to achieve.  The game can drag on endlessly due to successive bad rolls.  It also has a tendency to help the rich get richer, a reversal of fortune is a rare occurrence.  There is basically zero catch up mechanism offered, and I imagine it would not be an enjoyable experience if you are plagued with horrible dice results.

After 2+ Plays: Betting on these ships is better than playing the lottery only in that it's cheaper.  It's not actually any more fun.

No idea whatsoever how to be good at this game, but I like the mechanics and I am willing to try some more.

I think this game is under rated, not particularly serious, it does have some strategy , and is fun. Its basically a share buying game , where the value depends upon the right ship getting to the end of the course. But I still think it should have done better than it has.

Great gambling-style game with a weird theme but excellent mechanics. It definitely stands out for being unique.

 Puedes subastar por la posibilidad de escoger los botes de la ronda y compra de acciones de un color. Coloca a tus secuaces en los botes o en una de las casillas del tablero (llegada, no llegada, piratas). Luego se lanzan los dados para ver el avance de los botes.

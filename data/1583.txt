Great game on the advance of AGC. A scenario is a sort of "new version" of the old Panzergruppe Guderian.

It would be interesting to see the GDW/GRD efforts merged with GMT's.  Wonderful realism.  Will we ever see a complete set of games covering the entire Russian Campaign?

V.V.B.'s Barbarossa Army Group series are perhaps the best divisional level games on the Eastern Front. Yes, I do have some rule questions; there are either holes in the rules or in my head; I'm not sure which. 

There is a lot to learn, me bucko, so ye who are fearful of "fiddly" rules take notice. If you do not have the stomach for it, then go play your WWII:BtB and EE games; but that's all you will be doing is "playing a game." If you want to experience a fantastic historical simulation of the opening weeks of the Barbarossa Campaign, then gird your loins, sharpen your brains and quit your griping. 

"You get what you pay for" is true, not only in what you buy, but in what you invest, and if you are willing to invest the mental energy (along with some generous table space!), you will get a great return on your efforts.

With OCS, one of the great &quot;operational&quot;-level games of WWII - gives a great feel for running a campaign. Does better than OCS on the scenario front, with more interesting and playable scenarios. Barbarossa: Army Group North is probably the one to start with.

Tedious, annoying combat resolution system that sucks the fun out of the combat phase.  Just no fun to actually play.

Also too much chrome.

It's eastern front, it's a monster, it's even playabe!!!
Unfortunately it's old school wargame (but someone will like it better) and center eastern front in 1941 is even less appaling that south eastern front.

I like OCS much better, but I've got friends that swear for this system.

after 3.5 days of full-time playing at a convention, I would be hard-pressed to point out anything of merit that happened.

this is for the combined monster game.

This 1998 Barbarossa Series game is extremely fun to play, very educational and easy to learn with well written rules and on line resources for step by step instruction. The scenarios are a delight as is the map, counters, charts and the sturdy game box.

In-depth operational study on the eastern front. German Army Group Center drives towards Russian capital -- Moscow. On the way is Smolensk, a very city that block the Germans on the highway. The simulation system is sound, with lots of counters and huge maps. For all those WW2 eastern front fanatics.  A plus for the game is designed with a series in mind, saving huge learning costs with a consistent game framework. For all those WW2 eastern front fanatics. GMT, please reprint this!

Simply a fantastic system, well written rules and and the game has an excellent flow to it.  It seems to capture WW2 eastern front warfare very accurately with small scenarios and monster scenarios alike.

So hard to find and overpriced that it almost seemed a shame to actually punch the counters and play the game, but once you get past all the hype and the hideous box cover there is a very good game here.  4 full maps and four counter sheets makes for a lot of good-old-fashioned Nazi-vs-Russian shoot-em-up.  In my opinion, not really as much fun as Army Group North because the latter's variety and the quality of learning scenarios, but still a great game for East Front lovers.  Hopefully it will be reprinted soon. 

As far as game play goes, you don't have to be a masochist to play the Russians, but it really helps.  You have about 500 units made up mostly of largely useless infantry, a hopelessly muddled command structure, and no air force to speak of.  The Nazi player has a much better army and Luftwaffe but very little tolerance for losses and no time to waste.  All in all, a good, well balanced game.  Quite playable solitaire.

See my AGS comments.One of the best operational games of WW2. I think AGS and AGN are a little more interesting, though, which is merely personal taste. The interaction of the system with the terrain is still winning.

Played one part of the campaign on the german side: a lot of units and hard fights.
Great game and great game system with a lot of chrome. 
The best operationnal simulation of Barbarossa.

EPS is my favorite game system for operational level East Front Simulations. Topic is interesting. Large Tablespace demand, Needs to be redone in reprint with Typhoon incorported into or also released to current EFS standards.

EFS is THE system for old school wargaming of the Eastern front. Old school cause its a big monster with a lot of counter pushing, odd calculations and complicated supply rules. But, it is the best you can find out here, because this is a truly playable monster, and if you try one of many little to medium scenarios included it isn't a monster anymore too. Center is the biggest, the baddest and the largest of the game series, and it also lacks in the small scenario departments. But seeing the german truly juggernauting thru the first map in no time is really rewarding...

My favourite system on WW2 East front. Shows the relative capabilities of the opposing forces very well. AGC sees the Axis crushing all before it as they race towards Smolensk.

I like the system, and the topic interests me. This one is a big game and there is a lot of 'downtime' for the non phasing player. Bring a book to a session :) But when you are the phasing player, or during combat and reaction phase there is plenty to think about.

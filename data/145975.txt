This one is not happening. Chit-Pull activation in GBOH is not my cup of tea. Gameplay is highly random, you have little if no control over your units. Most leaders have poor quality, which makes trumping risky if not useless. Most battles are simply boring, nearly not tactical options here. Full color charts and Rulebook ae nice, though still errors in it.

Very well made game, but it suffers a little from the inherently straightforward nature of Hoplite warfare. It contains the only GBoH battle I've seen designed for more than two players, which is a plus.

RATING: 7
Another solid entry into the GBoH branding exercise.
The clumsy hoplite formations make it hard to maneuver
much. On top of that, they have a staying power which
precludes breakthroughs in the enemy line. All very 
historical - but not as much fun to play as some
of the others in the series.

In fact, the most interesting aspect seems to be the
use of archers. Nothing new in them, but they seem to
be able to affect the tough hoplites better than anything
(other than more hoplites).

The chit pull is fine here. Not as appealing as it was in 
Chariots of Fire though. I'm fond of not having to puzzle 
over who goes next when I leave the table for a bit.

After playing three scenarios now, I must admit I am a bit iffy on the experience. There is a clunkiness to the handling of the hoplite two-hex phalanx units that feels overly restrictive. Maybe I am missing something? 

Probably my least fav GBoH game to date. Makes me sad.

After two scenarios using simple GBOH rules this game is a solid 9. I only play solo but found the gameplay very quick and enjoyable. The rules are straightforward generally speaking though of course it helps having a grounding in the system. Although hoplite would not be a bad introduction to GBOH.

I really wanted to love this game.
Theme is there, feeling is there, units are well described and mechanics for attacking and defending are decent.
But the dynamics of the gameplay are just so lackluster.
With gazillion little tokens to place and move around.
Hellenic law of inertia is broken.
No explanation on what to do if opponent simply refuses to engage while your phalanx are wildly running at different speeds at the worst possible target.
Suggestion: cancel law of inertia when going uphill. This is a jab at the system.

RATING: 7
Seems to capture the feel of hoplite combat, but not sure that's necessarily a good thing in a game. As befits the era, the scenarios are pretty darn imbalanced and tend toward all-or-nothing outcomes so better play for the experience rather than the competition!

I absolutely love this game and it's theme. It has probably been on my table more times than any other game in my collection in the last couple of years. The rigidity of Hoplite tactics leaves few options for maneouvre (without totally trashing your phalanxes with formation hits) but this is historically accurate as the Greeks, with the exception of the fully professional Spartans, were mostly farmers and artisans "doing their bit" for their city states as part time warriors and lacked training.

The fundamental difference between Persian hit and run missile tactics with light troops and Greek hand-to-hand tactics using armoured hoplites is very well portrayed and forces players to think carefully about their forces' capabilities.

A good introduction to the GBoH series because of it's relative simplicity, this game includes all the famous battles of the period,with the exception of Thermopylae, which wouldn't make a very good  war game anyway (One hex frontage, one half inch Spartan hoplite counter versus all the Persians in the box ... Hmm ... a wise omission I think).

RATING: N/A
The latest of the GBOH series. Although I like the larger scope of history during which these battles took place, the battles themselves don't particularly interest me.

You basically have large, inflexible formations slamming into each other because Philip and Alexander weren't around yet to teach them the value of combined arms. And, in Delium at least, the special rules result in some rather gamey behavior that exposes some underlying problems with the system itself.

RATING: 7
Rules are vague and sometimes incomplete for a GBOH beginner like me. I had to check the Alexander rules for some basic things which somehow went overboard in the XV'th reincarnation of GBOH. Maybe no problem for a GBOH veteran, but it is a problem for a GBOH newbie like me.
For example, you'll search for in vain in the Hoplite rules for these absolutely fundamental rules: "each unit may fire only once per order", "A unit may perform Reaction Fire any number of times during enemy movement, as long as it is not Missile No". That's not the way to "streamline" rules.

Also I find the organization of the rulebook very chaotic. 

As if there are not enough exceptions strewn all over the rulebook (unit summaries are incomplete), every scenario has it's own scenario special rules (either the basic rules are not good enough - maybe still not enough exceptions - or the designers just want to torture the players). Like the rulers in Marathon using charisma, though they are not OCs, with the exception of personal combat, where they use values not even printed on the counters.

To me the rules are not up to 2014 standards. I enjoy the game so far, though.

I love the period and love the flavour of hoplite warfare that this module gp has brought to the GBoH. In fact I wished some of the mechanisms like the chit pull system were in earlier games!

Lots of historical tactical detail here; to be truthful, more than I feel like attempting to absorb while trying to stay awake. The rules for shock combat alone take up 6Â½ double-columned pages. A good number of ancient Greek and Persian battles are covered, but overall, I think this is for real ancients grognards only. The designers left out "play balance" in most of the scenarios although gamers may experience, or achieve, differently. The gem in the box is Plataea, but not for the faint of heart.

RATING: 8
First full GBoH game played. System is good in that the rules tweaks give a decent simulation of hoplite warfare. Hoplite vs hoplite battles lack some tactical nuance, but later battles involving Skirmishers and cavalry are more interesting. Have yet to play Cunuxa and Plataea. A good game, but gets a little repetitive.

There are several innovations over previous GBOH titles I really like - e.g. new activation system which is really good and solves one of my biggest problems with GBOH. However I still think SPQR is best game from GBOH family mostly because it offers much more diversity and tons of interesting scenarios (I may change my opinion after play of new Alexander though). One thing is clear - Hoplite might be good entry point (probably best) to the GBOH serie as rules are polished, battles relatively small (aside of Platae which is real beast) and straightforward.

As a Classical history major, the theme piques my interest more than anything. I've watched some playthroughs and this heavy, heavy game seems way over what my SO would play on a regular basis :/ Unfortunate for me.

The Great Battles of History rules have evolved considerably since early games of the series, but the general approach is the same.  Command and control is rather weak in this era and all battles in this game are linear with predefined setup (there is sometimes optional free setup though), so here is little room for player strategic decision making.  Tactical decision making occurs mainly after breakthrough, but by that point the game is often decided.  You do get to make some withdrawal and disengagement decisions, but these options rarely pay except for getting screening units out of the way.

Hoplite features an unusually wide range of weapon systems (i.e. unit types) for a GBOH game, so the learning potential is high.  The Cunaxa (Persian Civil War) scenario is particularly interesting as both sides throw everything but the kitchen sink into the battle.  Being Persians, if they'd had kitchen sinks they'd have used them in battle.  You've never seen and odds and sods army until you've seen Persians in a GBOH game.  Watching the weapons systems interact and trying to take advantage of these is the best aspect of the game (and the series).  Units die fast in Hoplite though, so you need to figure out what's going on before you start moving.  The bright side of having games end so quickly is that you can play several scenarios in a day.  Setup is equally quick.

Materials are great, looking very much like every other GBOH game.

Overall, a fascinating and highly playable simulation, but as a game it more resembles roulette than chess.

Just started... using the SGBoH/Hoplite rules... and may still play the standard rules, but after playing the first scenario, I am not sure if I like/understand the nature of hoplite warfare. It is interesting from a historical perspective, but just not interesting enough to play through all the scenarios.

Update: Played through three other scenarios... it is growing on me, to a limited extent. I will play through a few more scenarios (including Platea, the largest one) but I don't think I want to play the standard rules.

Final Thoughts: This is a very interesting game with the Simple GBOH rules (solitaire) and I enjoyed the game but I will not play all the scenarios nor try the standard rules.

Arrived and looks good.  Man, one massive battle in there.  They look pretty straightforward for the most part, so maybe I can convince a friend to face to face a game.  I really like the graphics of the GBoH series, and it has taught me a lot of history as well!

Nov '14- Started with Tanagre, a straightforward slugfest.  Sparta initially faltered in the middle, but one of the breakthrough Athenian units cut down by traitor cavalry.  Then, right side for Athens disintigrated as they lost, big time.

Not sure I have everything right, but had fun in a quick two hour battle, and cleanup was simple!

Oct '16:  Just finished Ephesus, and it was a washout as the Greeks had nothing to counter the Persian mobility. Played in 90 minutes.

I am really liking this game.  I like the historical feel and it is pretty easy to get into.  The chit pull system great for solo play. Yeah, I probably forget some rules and screw up others, but as long as I am having fun, who cares?  Already got the units ready for the next battle!

Instantly liked the look and feel of playing this. Even the simple (introductory?) battle that we played convinced me of the possibilities of the system. I thought that the hoplite-specific rules felt very thematic. (I also got lucky on a rather uninformed gamble about initiative and local majorities.)

RATING: 8
A most intriguing entry for the GBOH system. The rules are slightly simpler than the standard fare for this series. The designer and developer should really be given a pat on the back (or a pay rise) for this one as the rules and more particularly the combat rules are very well illustrated with examples each step along the way. This made the game very easy to pick up.

My rating score gains a point due to the high replayability of the package. This is measured in three ways, the first, is that 9 scenarios are included in the package. Three of these are small at a half map in size, while the largest is a two-map monster. Gain familiarity with the system and you will be able to set up and play the smallest scenarios within a few hours. The second issue is the variable speed of the phalanxes. Best laid plans can unravel here! The third is the trump system. While this is not new to the GBOH series, the feature in this package is should the trump attempt fail then your opponent may get an extra AM!

I was a playtester for this game. I had doubts how well GBoH system suits hoplite battles, yet designer and developer efforts made in the end for a really believable and satisfactory take on hoplite warfare. This in itself is an achievement, as I remember quite clearly my disappointment after trying some hoplite scenarios that were available under Alexander ruleset.

Certainly well illustrated rulebook make game concepts more approachable. It must be pointed out, however, that there are numerous and subtle differences, rules wise, in comparison to "classic" Alexander and SPQR. In the end, they make for slightly quicker game. What`s interesting, even smaller scenarios in the box can pose a nice challenge for both players.

Personally, I like change from Individual and Line Orders toward Formations being Activated. Decisions that such a change impose on players are different, but not any less interesting. And because I`m interested in the period and topic - it`s a game which I`m particularly fond of.

In the end, I`d even dare to say that it`s not a bad game to begin one`s adventure with GBoH, because of the efforts to clarify and improve the rules.

Score 9 after first play,still learning the system,but everything points that score will go higher.

Update: Testing the game intensively for 4 days in row,different scenarios,and i'm very very satisified,great game,great feels of warfare of ancient times.Rulebook can be better written,but tolerably overall - [u]section of rulebook from 8.0 till 8.2 are very well writen,with pictures and combat procedures.[/u] 

After intensively testing and playing i gave it score of 10,great GBoH system it is a benchmark/analysis for wargames and reconstruction of ancient battles.Level of applied tactics depends of one knowledge how to use properly every unit in a face of changing dynamic at the battlefield.
Very tense game to play,it offers experience of battlefield of ancient times, armed only with spears,arrows,cavalry.Hoplite offers epicness in term of size of units and game scale.I found Hoplite to be the game i brought to the table almost EVERY DAY!
Quote from rulebook which i found to be very true :[b]
"To calmly blunder into battle with a, âLetâs see what happens here,â theory is to be carried home on your shield in a remarkably short time.[/b]

This is probably the worst game in my collection, I must admit I don't like deck building games, but this one has a nasty rulebook and the artwork is not up my alley (little zombie girl freaks me out), this could have been inspired by the movie Zombieville (humour and zombies) but it is nothing like the movie in the end, the cards are of great stock quality and the game is cheap but it is also very non-thematic for a zombie game.

A simple little deck-building/destruction game. The /destruction part makes this game both fun and unique. ;-) Heavy with luck-o'-the-draw, but still stands proud as a brutal game of hosing and survival. Fun! B-)

I perhaps could consider this a better game after a few more plays, getting a grasp on mechanics and cards. I'd just prefer not to play this again, partly because of far too realistic goal and theme (everybody loses, some just less than others)..

RATING: 3
Terrible game.  Plan to never play this again.  I'm really confused by why it got Kickstarted (I suspect it is related to the strong artwork and the fact that it is a zombie game).

It has the player interaction a la Munchkin which allows other players to pile on zombies to the current players.  The game continued to drag on until we were already "done" with it before the first phase ended.  The fact that there were only a few of each item available led to the people with the ability to "buy" them first ended up having a runaway leader effect.

Interesting concept that there is the possibility for the zombies to win the game, but the designer himself admitted it was a very rare situation and difficult to execute.

the rules book is terrible, poor layout and poorly conveyed information, made me leave it in the box for ages. Another of our group was given it for christmas so played some games with their family, and brought it out for the group. It's a fun game, a bit bleak, and if you fall behind, you die, it's worse when you die slowly :P at least if it's quick, you can join the horde and get some payback on the person who took all the ammo!

RATING: 6
I'd give this game a much higher score if it weren't for a few things: a.) it's slow paced... especially when you add on more players b.) the randomizer card is useless. I do not want to have to pull out a copy of every card, shuffle them up, draw 8, and then have to put them all back. I want an extra copy (a la Dominion) that is made specifically for this purpose. Because of this c.) the set up for this game takes way too long for the type of game that it is.

This one is my deck-building and zombie theme game at the same time. Easy rules (although rulebook in the box is poorly done, online is much much better). Lots of flavor, stress and fun, great 70-80's B-movie artwork, great box, nicely done the surviving and becoming a zombie aspect.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
First the good: the artwork on the cards is decent, the dividers/placeholders with rules summaries printed on them is a good idea, and the ammo box to hold the cards in is a nice touch.  However, aside from the production values, this game is fucking awful.  The game is easy to explain, and yet, the rulebook does an absolutely terrible job of it.  Basically, the gameplay can be summarized thus: Zombie(s) appear --> Fight/flee? --> Success?  Pick up items that help you fight/flee, but killed zombies enter your deck. --> Failure?  Lose a ridiculous number of cards from your hand/deck, making it even more difficult to succeed against the next zombie horde, and the downward spiral begins.  The End.  How did this raise almost $50,000 on Kickstarter?!

Brought from Essen'11 signed by the designer... 

I don't get why people have problems understanding the game. For me it was quiet straithforward. I don't mean it is easy, but it is not hard.

I like that there are different winning conditions (3 altogether I think). Only drawback for me is that the game tends to get really unpredictable towards the end (when three or more zombies come out it is possible to lose in just one turn).

After playing this game several times, I am still not sure how I feel about it. The game seems fun while playing, but (unless something really unlucky happens and someone becomes a zombie very early) the win condition takes a VERY LONG time to achieve.

Unusual Deck Building game. You don't play to win. You play to last longer than the other guy. The rulebook is terrible. It did not make much sense at all. After reading several forums and online comments I hope I played correctly.

I have no desire to ever play this again. It does not compete with other deck building games.

Out of my collection.

RATING: 5.5
my first experience with a game that uses the "deck building" mechanic ( hadn't played Dominion before yet).  Evoked a bit of theme (being chased by nigh unkillable Zombies) but I felt it was a bit repetitive and not very deep.  It was just "OK".  3 players became zombies, making one player win by default, even though it didn't feel like any player played particularly well or badly - the final outcome felt kind of arbitrary.

The theme and the artwork are fantastic. I'm still on the fence about how much fun it actually is -- but regardless, there's a ton of variety in the different weapon/swag cards, and I like that it can be co-op if you choose to play it that way. Plus, eliminated players get to keep playing, so that's a plus.

What an incredibly terrible, un-fun game.  No narrative arc whatsoever; we happened upon a completely broken setup on my very first play that made one player entirely invincible - we eventually quit due to the entire table realizing we could have been 5 minutes or 500 minutes away from ending.

I will actively work to ensure I never play this again.

RATING: 4
An interesting deck builder with very simple cards (much less text to read) and an interesting sideline in dealing with the zombie hordes. It's also different in that your deck does not get clagged with useless cards since zombies can be played out of your hand to the horde and fleeing allows you to discard low value items. OTOH, you need some padding in your deck to avoid becoming a zombie. Interesting, but not very.

One of the new breed of truly different deck-building games, it doesn't feel like it's just another Dominion clone.

Interesting take on the deck building genre. The mechanics are slightly surprising at first (drafted cards go into your hand instead of in the discard).

RATING: 2
Rather than a deck building game this is more of a deck destruction game. You slowly lose parts of your deck to the zombie horde and need to fight to stay sane/keep your deck operational.

The game isn't very interesting to begin with. It basically consists of a single binary decision (flee/fight) and it is largely decided by the hand you drew since deck customising options are severely limited. And when the zombies start to come out in full force the last shreds of control go out the window. Thematically sound, maybe, but not a particularly engaging game at all.

I was really disappointed that this game wasn't as good as I was hoping (and I wasn't hoping for much!) I knew this would be a deck builder with a twist, but it really left me bored and unengaged. Nice box work and packaging, but a good game that does not make! Decisions appeared simple and without much thought needed. I liked the idea of "last man standing" but it was more like "how slow am I going to lose..." A pessimistic way of playing a game, but without much choice. Works for some people; not for me.

A cool deck building game where you are scrambling to survive zombies. I like that sometimes you might not want to trash cards in this game as they are also your life points

The added dimension of playing zombies on people and fleeing so the zombies pile up was cool. There is good tension in the game, especially at the end and even if you die and become a zombie, you can still contribute and win
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very enjoyable game, once people get to grips with it's different style of play/deckbuilding.  People who want it to play like Dominion or other Deckbuilders may not like it, though.  This isn't "KILL ALL ZOMBIES!!!", it's more of a take-that crossed with deckbuilding mechanics (purchasing better cards to add to your hand).

It's more cutthroat though (if players PLAY that way) and can be quite chaotic, especially towards the later stages of the game.  I very much enjoyed it and found it quite thematic.  I've been slowly able to get my wife and daughter to play it, but other gamers haven't taken to it.  YMMV...

The game is fun, but once it gets to the final rounds and it's obvious a co-op victory isn't possible for the game, the winner is very predictable.  The person who will end up winning will be the person who goes before the last person to turn into a zombie.  Once the zombies start coming out 5-6 cards at a time, it becomes impossible to kill enough or outrun enough to make a difference.  It's just a matter of which player is going last based on the turn order.  Wish there was a way to fix this.

Other than that, the rest of the game is a blast.

Edit: reduced rating from 7.5 to 4.5.  The more you play the game, the worse it gets.  The beginning and middle game is good, but once it gets to the point where 2-3+ zombies are showing up at a time, and it's determined that a co-op victory is impossible, the game becomes a countdown timer that players have little to no control over.  It usually doesn't matter how well-made your deck is, or how good your hand is.  The person who inevitably wins is ultimately determined by the turn order.  Bad game design, which makes me sad because this system has potential.  Wonder if there's a way to tweak it or house-rule it into a superior game?

Seems to have become a running joke in our game group. Perhaps best presentation of a game coupled with the worst rules ever written. The only way to enjoy this game is to completely love the Zombie Genre and to be willing to fight the complete lack of fun this game presents. Mayday Games did a pretty good job with Get Bit, but it's unlikely I will buy from them again after this utter failure. No chance I'll support them again on KickStarter. I opted against supporting Evolution on KS because of this stinker.

On game night we go take a look at the games available and about every other week I throw in "Eaten by Zombies" as an option. At this point, all I get is a snide look...not even a chuckle.  It might be time to add this game to the next bonfire.

Interesting twist on the deckbuilding genre with some clever mechanics.  The deck-as-life thing is cool, but fiddly.  Overall, could maybe use more development. I don't care for the zombie or deckbuilding worlds too much, but diff'rnt strokes make the world go round.  I think a lot of people will love this.

LATER: I have docked this game a full 2 points in rating because of the incomplete rulebook. After reading the rules as provided out of the box I could not even begin to play. Important concepts and icons were not defined at all. I was completely at sea.

Thankfully, we have BGG!

I was able to download comprehensible and complete rules that some other Geek has kindly provided. Once I had read all the rules, we were ready to go.

It seems that the rules presuppose that one already knows the ins and outs of deck-building games. For example, the rules specifically stated what I should not do, while underplaying what I should do.

NOTE: I was never able to access the FAQs on Google. No drag on rating, but man, that bites!

It's just a good thing this game is so entertaining. It's no fun to search on-line for rules and find the game is mediocre.

RATING: 2
It sounded good in concept, but the mechanics don't live up to the hype. It's all too easy to fall into a snowballing decline of losing several cards turn after turn until you're stuck playing on the zombie side (i.e. bored to death). I get that it's a last man standing sort of thing, but it's just not fun. Deck building is not the best genre for this type of game.

The period artwork is cool, but the yellow-red rising sun pattern on the item cards is ugly as fuck when the card piles are laid out on the table.

"2" rating equals "won't ever play this again". Why bother wasting the time when there are better deck builders out there?

Really interesting deckbuilding game. Some things to keep in mind:

This game is fairly short! At first I was feeling frustrated because I thought it was pretty difficult to stay alive for too long. However, I am now realizing that this is a simple 20-25 minute game. I like it! With so many epic games out there that take 45-90 minutes, it's nice to have a quick fun game to play.

The deckbuilding mechanics are much different than the more traditional Dominion-style. You really don't want to thin your deck too quickly, if at all. One bad turn, you can lose 10-15 cards pretty easily and you will become a zombie!

I love the theme/artwork/etc. It is very funny and interesting. Usually I feel like a total nerd as you narrate a game, but this one just makes you laugh.

Great game, thanks Max!

Impressive production quality...more publishers need to use the "FAQ on the dividers" idea, and I'm amazed no one's done an Ammo Case box before.  SO cool.

The game is another impressive entry in the "DBG 2.0" category.  Like Puzzle Strike and Nightfall, it has the same basic core as Dominion, but differs significantly in gameplay.  A great addition to my collection.

An Essen 2011 purchase, this zombie deck building game really captures the theme very well and has the excellent mechanic of players becoming zombies, so no player is ever really eliminated.
Plays fast and is easy to teach.
Only issue is the strange explosion art behind every object on the item cards... a bit of an eye-sore, but okay, its just a very small negative :-)
Still highly recommended.

An excellent spin on the now-omnipresent deck building concept.  Up to a point.  I really would have liked to see stronger strategy for the zombie players--strategy that would enable turned players to pull a win more effectively.  Perhaps if the zombie players only needed to win by turning the majority of players at the table?

This is Kip and Mimi's game.

LIKES:

* I appreciated the variable winning conditions of the game which allowed players who had become zombies to potentially win the game.
* While I liked that there was two avenues to dealing with zombies (fight or flee), I'm not sure if fleeing is a good long term option in the game since you have to lose cards from your hand/deck if you flee.  

DISLIKES:

* I didn't care much for the art or the color choices.  Of course, when you talk about art for a zombie game, is there really art that I would appreciate?  
* I felt the game got out of control and out of hand for the players once the zombies started coming out in force midway through the second time through the zombie deck.  In some ways, I suppose that fits the theme as I don't know if one is supposed to survive a zombie apocalypse.  At that point, it was just a question of who was going to become a zombie first...

In all fairness, I'm not the targeted audience for this game as I don't get excited about the theme either.

underrated  game !!

Turn Sequence Explained Reveal the Horde: Start your turn by revealing a zombie from the Zombie Deck and add it to the Horde.
 Each subsequent turn players will start their turn by adding one zombie to the Horde whether there are existing zombies in the Horde or not.
 Any zombies added to the Horde are placed to the right of the first Zombie card and the new card represents the “closest” zombie to the player for fight purposes.
 After the Horde is revealed, each opponent, in reverse turn order, may add one zombie from their hand to the Horde. In a two player game you may add any number of zombies to the Horde. 
Zombies being added to the Horde by players must always have an Attrition value higher than the number of zombie cards currently in the horde.
 For example, if there are two zombies in the horde on Bob’s turn then June cannot add a zombie with an Attrition value less than “3”.
 Hint: This means you must be careful how you approach any “1” Attrition value zombie as killing it will mean it will likely stay in your hand forever since you can never add it to the Horde on another Survivor’s turn.
 Keep in mind that any Zombies killed end up in your discard pile and will eventually end up in your hand as you go through your deck.
 The only way to rid yourself of zombies in your hand is to add them to the Horde on other Survivor’s turns.
 Be careful how you manage the zombies you kill or you may become all but powerless, or worse INSANE!
 If the Zombie Deck is ever depleted, simply shuffle the Zombie Discard and start the Zombie Deck anew. Each time the Zombie Deck is shuffled, add one to the number of zombies revealed at the start of the following Survivor’s turn.
 You will face more and more zombie until there is only a single Survivor left alive.

I was expecting this to be a good game. The box looked great as well as how the cards were arranged inside. As the owner was explaining the game to us, it started to get confusing. We lose half of this when we flee? When we kill we lose all? When do hordes disperse? Only the last one disperse? And so on. Worse still, midway through the game, we realised that we were playing wrong, checked the rules and oh yeah, we were playing wrong. I'm guessing that the rules weren't well written, so I guess I might try another game, hopefully this time played properly.

Another day, another deck-building game. The pros here are the quirky illustrations - the different pics on each starter deck are an especially nice touch - and an interesting overall dynamic: from a placid build-up phase that allows you to improve your deck at leisure, things quite rapidly take a turn for the worse, until the goal in the last few rounds is not to win against the overwhelming zombie horde, but just to lose a bit slower than the other players.

Apart from a definitive kingmaker problem, the biggest strike against this is the same as against almost all Dominion adaptions: why would I ever play a round of this again when I could instead play two or three rounds of the deeper and far better developed original deckbuilder?

RATING: 8
A good 2-3 player game that mimics the feeling of desperateness and surviving horror. The use of cards for deck-building does not diminish the fun we have as a group. Unfortunately, with 4-5 players, the game tends to go longer than expected, often ending towards a 3 hours mark.

I'm not really into zombies or deck building games generally, so I'm not the target audience. I liked the artwork enough though, so gave it a try, and it's better than I hoped.

A pretty fun game with some serious flaws, not least of which is the rule book. It's not that it's bad, but for a deck builder, Eaten by Zombies is fairly unintuitive, and the rules don't do a very good job of helping to convey what's happening. It also has a serious rich get richer problem, and many of the cards feel derivative of each other. I enjoyed my one play of this, but it isn't anything worth revisiting.

Purchased and played at Spiel 2011. It's a little more complicated than most of these types of games but follows the usual plan of cards with hordes of zombies and others with various implements to kill them and the odd events thrown in.

Wow! Where to start? Crap rule book, great art work. Great theme but horrible game play... for me at least. This game has such a great look and amazing packaging but really missed the mark when it came to actual game play. I can see the potential but the rule book clarifies nothing and as far as a DBG!? What deck can I build? I played this as a 2 player game with my better half and we struggled to find the fun. Maybe we are missing the point but this just sucked out loud. Yes I can flee from every zombie and buy swag so I will have more cards than you. Oh the fun. Let's try another strategy and fight them only to end up with zombies in my hand that after "day 2" I cant get rid of. If I'm missing something please let me know, I only give this game a 5 because of the overall packaging and theme. I feel like I spent my $ on a magic bean. At least I have a bean.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The theme is definitely fun but unfortunately it is about the only thing holding this game together. The rulebook writing is the most gruesome component of the game and the poorly written rules are a reflection of a poor gameplay experience.  That being said, the game does play very different than any other deck builder I have played and will probably play more as I explore different strategies; however, I don't have much hope that I will still be playing this game a few months from now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The included rule book isn't very good, but the card art and gameplay is fun.  We finally sorted out the various events that happen with the horde based on success / failure on fight and flee.  The game is fun, and captures the sense of impending doom very well.  It's definitely a game of who-can-survive-longest...and as such might not be for everyone.  I'm curious what the planned expansion has in store!

The biggest surprise of Essen 2011. The game is an absolute blast, not the least because it turns everything upside down: The players do quite well in the beginning of the game, but quite soon everything goes to hell. There seems to be quite a big first player advantage though, at least with three players.

Component quality is very good (except for the complete lack of proofreading). Proper dividers are also included in the box. The fancy box cover is difficult to use.

The first edition rulebook is completely useless. Rulebook v2.2 is immensely more helpful but still manages to omit several essential rules and definitions. Clarifications for the more complex cards are also still missing.

Based on one play: You fight Zombies using your deck, similar to games like Dominion and Thunderstone. You have two options, fight or flee and you must play enough cards to flee the whole pack of Zombies. At first there is only one and then they start to come out by 2 or 3 and opponents can add Zombies since when you kill one you get them in your draw deck. Fail and you lose cards, having lost all your cards you turn into a Zombie! The game is not very smooth and the mechanics of losing cards does not really work well. It makes for a fairly random game.

I need to reevaluate my thoughts on this game later on. The game seem to be a first pass at the deck of zombies to build up, followed by nasty and quick player elimination. We were not quite clear on the rules for the Zombie player. Game is fun, but we need to play it more and understand it.

An interesting and different take on deck building... you're essentially building up the deck for IT to survive all the hits you take from Zombies - which makes for a great thematic fit.  Plays like a co-op, deck builder hybrid.  I like it.

A novel approach to the deck-building genre. I like the choice to fight or flee, but remembering how zombies react to each situation is tough at first. It's hilarious how quickly players turn on eachother as things start to get ugly, but sometimes I think the zombie hoard gets out of hand too fast. players are usually eliminated within a turn of one another.

It's got the thunderstone problem of wanting to draw all fight or all flee, and not having control.  But with less variety than tunderstone and no strategic diversification .  Mostly it's just boring.

Also, the cards have a LOT of rules that are not on them, and which are only mentioned on the dividers used to organize them in the box.  It's quite a disaster of information representation.

Love the theme, love the mechanism of becoming zombie once you lose as a human.

The fact that players could ALL win, only ONE win or ALL lose is perfect as well. Are we working for cooperative win? Or rather you would make the life of other players harder to become the last man standing? 

Unfortunately, the rule book is HARD. Really, HARD, that means some people do quit as they cannot get through to proper gameplay..

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
It's kind of a neat idea--there's a thematic story arc where you're trying desperately to build a decent deck before you get wrecked by the zombies. But it is super clunky and non-intuitive.

And the fact that you can play zombies on other people leads to a lot of luck. If opponents happen to draw a zombie, you'll get your face eaten off. If not...good for you! As the game moves along there are more zombies in people's hands, but (as happened in our game), two people having early zombies in their hands murdered one player. And there was nothing he could do about it.

Which leads to another major problem. The killed people are now zombies who are also playing against us. But unless I was taught something wrong, all they are is kingmakers now. Unfun.

One guy had the chance to end the game, and he did because we just weren't having much fun. I won. Go me.

There are lots of good deck-building games, and I'm glad designers are trying new things in the genre, but this just didn't seem to "work" for me.

RATING: 5
Fast, thematic, and fun. There is a fair amount of randomness in the end game, but the game is fast enough that I don't mind. Also, the randomness is thematic. Trying to stay ahead of the zombie hoard is fun, and beating the zombie deck can be rewarding. 

---------

On more plays I'm finding the game a bit too predictable, at least with 2 players. The weak cards are so weak they're pretty much pointless, and the strong cards tend to lead to either ridiculously easy victories over the zombie horde, or fleeathons where the first person to fail loses really, really hard. The biggest issue is that you just have too much time to get set up. I often end up spending several turns in a holding pattern, just waiting for something to happen, as there aren't any more cards around that would actually improve my deck. With more players you have fewer turns to build up, since you add zombies, but the number of zombies per player goes down.

I'm thinking of using the 3 player zombie deck for 2 player, but only using half for the first zombie deck cycle. That would speed up the game, put pressure on the survivors faster, and make fighting victories at least a little more challenging with a few decent fighting cards in the mix.

Card, Deck-building. Played this at BGGcon. The game has some potential, but some of the rules were unclear and, as it progressed, it seemed like it would be impossible for the humans to win (which seems by design, now that I've read the description).

Rulebook could use a good rewrite. Some spots sort of ambiguously contradict each other, and there wasn't even a diagram of a card with explanation (e.g., zombie cards only have two values on them, but you're left to figure out which is which).

Light, incredibly thematic deckbuilder with outstanding artwork (and a dreadful rulebook). I think it has some issues mechanicaly, e.g. the effect of the zombie draw has too great an impact, and with more than two there's a bit of bash-the-leader. It has the tendency to run long.

But [i]thematically[/i] it's a triumph: fighting, fleeing, scavenging, attrition - it's a very tight design and a perfect fit for the mechanics.

As an aside, as I have come to expect from Mayday, really great production quality.

RATING: 1
I only had 1 play yet so my rating might change if I get more plays.

The game looks good, box is awesome, theme (zombies) is interesting.

My problem is with the mechanics. There are a lot of small rules that make the game too complicated and there is no easy reference included for this: if you do x you lose z cards, if you do y you lose z/2 cards etc. Also the fact that you get constantly weaker is not really fun. I get the mechanical explanation that by killing zombies you get insane but I don't think it is fun.

In my first game we got the rules right, almost defeated all of the zombies, only the strongest was left, and then in 3 rounds or so I lost and I'm not sure what I did wrong. I still don't know if it's better to run or fight.

I'm not sure I will be able to get too many people playing this game (although they like zombies) but we'll see. 

I played a 3player game and it was much worse. The rules were still confusing, in the printed rulebook it was still hard to find all the small rules, the Zombie player mechanics was hard to get and the game ended soon and we didn't know what went wrong. I don't think I will want to play it again soon.

This is a beautifully produced game down to every detail.  The theme is carefully crafted around the 1950s zombie phenom.  It doesn't get highest ratings, however, because it's somehow fiddly for the few games.  It doesn't catch on.  It's very thematic, but hmm...

A fun, quick deck building, zombie killing experience. Horrible, horrible rulebook. Descriptions on the cards were sometimes different to the descriptions in the box. Much confusion arose. With 4 players it seemed to take too long for what it offered. It was hard to eliminate players quickly so the zombie players didn't come into effect until the game was almost over. I like the way that failed attempts to kill or flee the zombie hordes destroys your deck and how running out of cards kills you. Having said that, it is fun.

About [thing=76247][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
A deckbuilding game with both competitive and cooperative (with a campaign) modes of play. The theme is the usual Zombie one: survive, scrap, kill - both zombies and humans - or be killed. It has lots of humor and is more thematic than expected for a deck builder.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
The player will start his turn with 6 cards in hand, and in his turn the player play his cards in order to either fight the zombies or to flee. Regardless of the way he deal with the zombies, if he succeeds, the amount of fight power or, well, "flee" power, can be used as currency in order to scrap (buy) one or more of the available cards. Each cards has a value, and unspent power of fight or flee is lost. The is no limit, except, of course, the amount of currency, to the number of cards that a player can buy, nor a limit to the amount of cards the player can use.

Cards bought go into the hand of the players. Players fill up the hand to six cards at the end of the turn. A player "die" if he must draw cards and isn't able, or when he must discard cards and isn't able or when his hand of cards has only zombie cards.

The end game happens, in the competitive mode, when only one character (player) is left alive, and in the cooperative mode when the zombie horde is defeated.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
If to fight the zombies or to run from them. Fight is, objectively, worst, since the zombie card goes into the players discard pile, and once the zombie card is drawn by the player it can't be discarded, only used against someone else (not all that great in cooperative mode). Flee, if sucessful, makes the player lose cards equal to [u]half[/u] the number of attrition of the zombies - which can be a great way to trash unwanted cards, but can be dangerous as not having enough cards to sustain damage can lead a player to be killed.

Also, which cards to buy and which to trash (when trashing due damage, the player can choose to discard from hand, or from the draw deck, blindly).

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
It is thematic and the decisions aren't always obvious. Yes, the two main decisions, fight or flee, are usual given, due to the cards in hand, but there are several synergies between many cards, which can lead players to wildly different paths during play.

The game comes with two modes: competitive and cooperative. And the cooperative has a sort of a campaign, in which players survive in a series of nights, from the start of the infection until many days later, and the theme is still present here, as, for instance, in Day 1, the itens available are mostly things you can find in a house/garage.

The box for the game is awesome and the cards fit inside even with sleeves.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
There are some. First: the game has some minor issue with the rulebook. But there is a 2.0 of the rules [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/117694/eaten-zombies-rules-20]here[/url].

The gameplay is long and there isn't all that much chance of things to be done. Is always fight or flee + buy cards. It like my deck builders to be fast to play, but, at least in the cooperative mode, games can last around 1 hour, which is too much due to the little variation.

As one must expect from a deck builder, luck of the draw is vey much involved throughout.

There are cards with misspelled words, which can bothersome, but I didn't notice any harmful gameplay effect due to this.

The art of the cards can be a winner to some and a loser to others, or even both at the same time (as with me), since:

[imageid=992206medium]
[c]              Winner                               Loser[/c]

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
I said that [thing=76247][/thing] was more thematic than most deck builders. This still doesn't mean all that much. You won't really feel like you are fighting for survival, for your life. It is mostly a mechanical procedure. Still, there is theme enough to enjoy and make some jokes about it. And the characters do can die, so there is pressure to stay alive. Is important to add that, in the competitive mode, after the character dies, the player of it keeps playing, now as a zombie.

Overall, the game works well enough, but isn't as dynamic or varied as I want - think of it as the second season of The Walking Dead.

I really want to like this game -- it has a cool theme, it's a deck-building game, and it has some nice-quality cards with a really cool box -- but it ultimately fails because it's not intuitive or interesting, and sacrifices too much of the game to its theme.  It has rules that apply differently to different situations, outside of the cards that change the rules in normal deck-building games, and it's difficult to keep track of what you're supposed to do with attrition under given circumstances.  It might improve some with more plays, but so far, there's just not a whole lot there to make it very engaging, especially when a player becomes a zombie.  At that point, he can't win, and what he can do on his turn is just steer the game toward one person or another being the last person standing.  That may work for some gamers, but it's not my thing.

In Eaten By Zombies! players strive to survive as the horde of the living dead make it their goal in Death to force you to join the crowd. You must work with or against the other survivors to be the last one standing. No not standing, cowering in the corner crying for their mommy.
\13\\13\
In the spirit of AMC's "The Walking Dead" and "I Am Legend", Eaten By Zombies takes you into a dark world of eventual death. Every turn you must venture out from your safehouse and scavenge for Swag. But not so fast, the Undead have other plans for your brains. Every day a Horde of fresh zombies will be waiting for you, and over time the threat gets greater. Now it's time for your "Fight or Flight" instincts to help you to survive just one more day. Using the swag you've got on you (ie cards in you hand) you must survive any way you can.
\13\\13\
If you can get away or kill the Horde, you may scavenge the remains of the desolate suburbs for any Swag the neighbors may have left behind. With the right stuff and a few good friends to out run, you may just make it through this alive... well, no probably not. But being the last one to die a slow, painful death means you can claim sole victory!

With a set of over thirty different cards to start with, no two games will ever be alike. This game is a combination of Card Drafting, Hand Management and Survival Horror with a few dirty tricks thrown in.

Eaten by Zombies! is a great spin on the Dominion formula. If you have played Dominion before, I can literally teach you this game in five minutes. It's more than just a retread though, as subtle changes to the system make for a much more confrontational game than Dominion. There are no victory points, you just throw zombies at your opponents and watch them try to survive another turn. Then it's up to you to frantically scramble for answers when they they return the favor, with the last man standing declared the winner...It doesn't get more interactive than that!

The art work is a fantastic fit for the 50's B-movie motif of the game and giving each player's starting deck its own unique art is a nice touch. The only negative thing I have to say about the whole production is that Mayday Games is in serious need of a proofreader. There are more gratuitous spelling and grammar errors here than you would find in a fifth grade book report. It baffles me that a coven of nerds (I mean who else could design a game this cool?) would have such an abysmal grasp of the English language.

If you can look past the amateurish writing and rulebook, you'll find that the game plays quite well and is a lot of fun. Hopefully the game will sell well enough to merit expansions, as a one shot deck-builder rarely has any legs. I enjoy it enough to want more cards and if it sells really well, they may even hire a decent editor!

Cool Zed themed deck building game that's different in mechanics than your usual deck builder.  Being the last one standing gets the win but you're not out of it yet if you turn Zed as you could still win collectively as the Zombies.  I like the artwork.

A bit of a fail for us; looks great but seems to lack "game".

Second generation deck builder to outlive the other survivors of the zombie onslaught.  Survivor start decks include fight, flee, and of course eat sandwich cards.  There are fun interactive cards from the draw piles when building your deck.  Destroying zombies is probably not a theme for youngsters and some artwork is definitely pushing the envelope. Simple and clever mechanics are intuitive and easy to teach but rules make it confusing...go figure? Draw extra zombies on depleted decks is a nice touch. One failed flight or flee can be very punitive losing swag and all you can hope  for is becoming a zombie player--not great.

Entertaining little zombie-fighting deckbuilding game, where the last player to be eaten wins.

Interesting twist on deck building. Early in the game you are collecting people and at some point the people start dieing and you are depleting your deck. Last person alive wins. Cute but not that good.

Not a lot of game here, but fun to bring out around Halloween.

Update 11/07/12:

Dominion type game. Have the expansion with it; yet to play it together. Feel it's a great game. Too little cards at the moment, so there may be games alike. But definitely a good game if there isn't staleness.

I finally played this a couple of times. It's fun but the zombie theme is a bit tired by now. Still, rating it on its own merits as a deck builder, its uniqueness cannot be ignored. I'm still not a huge fan of the artwork but I am a fan of the overall gameplay mechanic.

A thematic deck builder. I don't quite enjoy deck builders. But this is actually unique an experience.

I love the narrative flow of this game, it emulates the zombie genre of movies with style! It is however quite a dark story arc, as there's very little hope of surviving, count on at best winning by being the last one alive. I've only once seen us defeat the zombie horde and determine a winner by counting cards in our decks, but at least I now know that it is possible. I also think that it does require some cooperative play in order to pull off.

The ammo box style packaging is great, the cards are of wonderful stock and quality, and everything fits very well in the box, with enough room for the upcoming 2-player expansion. The randomizer cards being over-sized and containing rule clarifications on them is ingenious!

I want to point out that I like the rules, both formatting and layout. I think they cover everything needed to play quite well, but they are unfortunately not very suitable as a reference during play. However, don't forget that the individual card clarifications are included on the randomizer cards. The rules have also been updated and better versions are available to download.

After a few more plays I have upped the rating to "9" as this is not just my favorite deck-builder and the best zombie-themed game I've tried, but quickly becoming a game with top 10 potential!

As a deck builder it didnt seem to interest me. I would rather play Resident Evil card game.

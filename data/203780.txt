LIKE: It's faster than the board game, but still retains some of the money and auction balance.

DISLIKE: No map, so the area control is lost. Players can fall behind and there is little to do to catch up. Wasn't any big surprises in the end. Resources are a tad fiddly.

OVERALL: It's ok, but I enjoy playing with the map better. As an auction game, I think there are other more interesting auction games I'd prefer.

Excellent implementation of the full game - simpler in that there is no route building which some might argue removes a critical portion of money management and planning. But for me, the simplicity is welcome as you are only left in the power plant auction and resource acquisition. Perfect information is lost as well since you cannot plan resources as easily. All in all, a good package, colorful, and stressful - as a card implementation should be.

This card game captures the feel of the original Power Grid surprisingly well. You have the same tension in power plant auctions and there is a clear shift in strategy from early game to end game. Moreover, players have to have eye for tactics regarding the playing order, because the auctions and the fuel market can be unforgiving for players in bad position.

So, the games have a lot in common but there are changes, too. The biggest difference is that now there is no map and all the heavy math involved with the building of your network exists no more. This is major change making the game considerably lighter. In addition, the amount of money handled by the players is brought down by a decade as the it is counted in tens instead of hundreds. These two tweaks ensure that there is no need for a pocket calculator any more. I guess, this is exactly what the designer wanted. However, less money in circulation also increases to worth of every single elektron (=the currency in the game). This creates a slight shift in the balance because now money is close to everything (=a reference to the old Power Grid wisdom that 'Money is not everything but in Power Grid it is a tie breaker'. it should be noted though, that this shift in balance is not a bad thing in my book. It just makes the game a bit different.

However, missing the map is huge. I feel like half of the game has been cut away. I definitely was not keen on doing the sums as it was mentally exhausting and dragged the game to infuriating measures, but battle on the map made the whole experience much more concrete. Now the game takes place on a much more abstract level and there are no obvious in game turning points due to the absence of Phase 1, 2 and 3 that marked certain mid-game highlights.

But, I like the game and I definitely love the absence of heavy math. However, being true to myself, I also miss the map. Thus the card game does not quite reach the level of the original but it is pretty damn close.

Power grid without need for calculator. Resource market seems complicated but works well enought. I would choose this instead of standard Grid because this maintains the feel but doesn't require so carefull counting (because of missing houses).

RATING: 7
Pretty good simplification of Power Grid.  Unfortunately, it's still pretty complicated and fiddly for a card game.  I don't miss the board and connection stuff as much as I thought I would.  You could almost say that this is two-thirds the same game as the original.  Sorry that the box is so big for what's in it.

RATING: 7
Nice game about bidding and blocking.  Pretty close games where one card flip differently would have had a different winner.

Also nice that the arithmetic is limited to simple bidding and payment, and playtime is fairly quick.

Ended up trading it on, as my family doesn't enjoy auction games and I struggled to get it played.

played a solo game, and then a 3 player game. And yes, this box should say 4+ players. The 2-3 player game simply is a little un-eventful when you get to the end of the game. While having more players should churn the power plant deck a bit more and help get the bigger plants into the auction.  The scaling on the resource market is also appreciated, but also a matter of compromise from the ideal of 6 players. The rules fiddlyness it a bit high, but as long as you wrap your head around it well from the rules book, explaining it to the gamers isn't so bad.

1/6/17: Didn't care for this with six.  The core mechanic seems to be maneuvering for turn order.  I can enjoy that, but the last round seemed to be a considerable letdown with the draw of the power plants overwhelming strategy.  The end scores seemed to be tight 24-26, and the key seems to be to ensure that you buy a great power plant on the last turn that will bump you up enough.

:thumbsup: Inexpensive.  $13 at Coolstuff
:thumbsup:  Plays quickly.

:thumbsdown: Final round seemed to overpower previous play throughout the game.  You really need to have the cards come up so that you can buy a 10 power plant.

Didn't care for this with six.

I've tried to steer clear of "X: The Card Game," because I have tended to think of the card game as lesser. Not true here; all the good of Power Grid with none of the rigmarole. Though the propensity for razor thin margins in this game can make the final round quite predictable.

It's a simplified Power Grid that plays in a much shorter time and the flow and feeling of the original is there, but it lacked tension somewhat. It also feels a lot more bland and luck plays a bigger factor than it's bigger brother. I like [thing=2651]Power Grid[/thing] 'okay' but the only improvement here is shorter play time.

I'm going to start out by admitting that we missed a rule, one that could have a significant effect on gameplay... Simply put we missed the rule that says that if no one buys the power plant with the discount token on it that plant is discarded at the end of the round. I can see this rule speeding up the progression of the game and I'm looking forward to trying it again.

That being said, I'm at a bit of a lose as to why this game actually exists. I've never said that what I'm really looking for out of Power Grid is a shorter game. It's not a bad game, I just don't ever see my self playing this over the original.

There are fewer catch-up mechanisms, less tension, less replayability, and an endgame that sneaks up on you.  It's only strong suit is the shorter time.

The buzz on this hasn't been that great, but I played it at BGG.con and thoroughly  enjoyed it - very clever remake of Power Grid in a compact, fast-playing format. Gets at basically all the good stuff from Power Grid in a much lower profile. Clean, easy to play, and the money management choices are more interesting than classic Power Grid because all money counts at the end, in varying amounts (money on the last turn counts more still, but sensibly conserving cash game-long can easily overcome a deficit of a city or two on the final turn, which is cool). The playing time and length is also perfect. Anyway, a lot to like here for fans of Power Grid, and also for people who possibly want to like Power Grid more than they actually do.

RATING: 4
While the game was clever in maintaining a sort of Power Grid-like feel with nothing but cards and money, I just really didn't care for Power Grid without the map. When stripped just down to bidding on power plants and buying resources, I just found myself bored by it.

Also, turn order becomes incredibly important in this game, which was actually the most interesting decision, as the game allows you manipulate that much more than plain Power Grid. Some times, if you're in the lead for turn order, there just plain won't be the resources available you need by the time your turn comes to buy, so heading into the last round, you really need to be paying attention to where you need to be. I don't know if I liked this or not; just an observation.

But, overall, not a game I'll be looking to return to, although it does provide a Power Griddish feel in a shorter playing time if that's something you're looking for.

The auction part of Power Grid. It works fairly work, and there is a workable variant for 2 players. However, the swinginess of the resource cards, and the utter reliance on the last round (like the original) make this one a pleasant quick filler, of which there are very many. Solid game, but not enticing to me.

Contains one of the most annoying things in card games:  square cards that have to be rotated to show a value.  Here, the problem is magnified because they have to be placed into columns also.   This won't work well on a hard surface.   But, anyway...  the game removes the map from Power Grid.   I really missed it.   This is a pure numbers game.  It is short and competitive, but I would almost always rather play Power Grid over this.   It's too bad that every game needs to have a card game or dice game version.   Power Grid didn't.

I long imagined a card version of Power Grid. Alas, the version in my head included plant cards that you arrange to build either a shared, or possibly individual, network/tableau. This version lacks that idea but perhaps it can still be great. The network building in the board game is really just another market-limiting mechanic anyway.

The card game retains the power plant auction from the board game but changes the resource market into a random and rather unpredictable things where turn order is even more important than in the original and drops the board play completely. As a result, it is considerably less interesting than its ancestor (that I'm also not a big fan of) although it thankfully plays a lot quicker.

Mostly played with 2. It feels flat to me played with just 2 players. The addition of the "trust" is good, but the auction feel a bit flat to me. I would like an I.A. player more interactive in the auctions like they did in the expansion for the game Fleet, Fleet: Artic Bounty. I will try to design a variant that takes the auction mechanism in Fleet: Artic Bounty for the "trust".

Other than that the game is great with more players and very fast. The scores are very tight in every game I played.

It's not a bad game, but given that the original is out there for a long time now, there's no real reason for this. It feels even more abstract, needs atleast the same table space and doesn't offer anything new (compared to the original).

This one is even more solitaire, as there's no board and you can't block off anyone, as everything is open in this one. It really felt like the german version of it, where everyone is building his own stuff without any interaction.

I do prefer the original for sure.

Played so far as a 6, it captures most of power grid in a shorter time. It's a bit fiddly on the turn order, but this can be overcome by putting the income on the player cards.

It's also a little bit fiddly on the resource market.

Money is very tight, leading to rounds where people don't buy plants.

It can also be painfully obvious in the last round that a player cannot win, as they can only buy one power plant a round.

It's not quite the game that Power Grid is, but it is easily playable and can play it more often.

removing the map does indeed shave off some playtime and crunch time.  the most important part of the game, managing your power plant acquisitions, is still intact
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think the game succeeds at giving the "feel" of Power Grid, but with less decision points. Instead of powering up connected cities, players power up their plants for money directly. On the final turn, plants are powered up for points rather than money, with every $10 in cash on hand providing an extra point.

While I do miss the connection building, the main disappointment for me is the resource market - which is the most brilliant aspect of the board game. To replicate the increased cost and scarcity, resources are randomly added to the market each turn after resources remaining from the previous turn are reduced in cost. This reduces control and information in what power plants will be good investments and makes valuation more of a crap shoot. Interestingly, because there is less to invest in, players typically have more cash left over at the end, which makes end game cash more of a deciding factor in the win. Not all card and dice versions of board games try to replicate their inspirations exactly, but this one clearly attempts to do that. It's not a bad attempt, but will always feel like an inferior copy of the game it is trying to emulate.

I liked this a lot. It removes the map portion out of Power Grid and keeps the feel of everything else. Resources pile up and power plants become available just as they do in the original game.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

My thoughts are if you enjoy Power Grid you will likely enjoy the card game as it has a solid game around the Power Grid concept without using a map phase. If I had to play one or the other, I'd choose this just because it plays more quickly. I still won't look to play if I have a choice though as I don't enjoy this type of incremental mathy game.

Oof. 

We made the classic mistake of playing this cold without anyone having read the rules first late in the evening after our PG game. So, I'll have to call my rating provisional for now. 

However, I'm not completely sold on the concept. The game takes up a lot of room on the table, a flaw it shares with [thing=191977][/thing]. I know card games don't automatically mean a small table footprint, but I won't e.g. be taking this to the pub to play with my wife. 

There are also a bunch of exceptions that need to be remembered. They're plainly stated in the rules, but even so.

Then there's the artwork. It uses the same blah artwork style from [thing=155873][/thing] without the actually relatively pretty map to make up for the cards.

It captures the auction part of PG quite well, but without the map and planning your route part, it's just a rather dry almost abstract game without a really exciting dynamic. 

Disappointing.

Initial Impressions: While I like it I think this is vastly inferior to Power Grid. On paper, it might seem like it is over half the game (since you seemingly only remove the map aspect while keeping the auctions and the resource buying decisions) while being less than half the time. However, there are a lot of things that are tied to the map, which means even without the network building aspect of the map (which I won't mention here since I think that is fairly obvious) I think this is a much more inferior game.

First, my thematic issue with the card game is that the board game, while simplifying a lot from reality, did in fact feel like you were playing a game about managing a power grid, whereas the card game feels like a stock holding game that is vaguely about energy. In the board game, the map requiring you to power actual cities is makes thematic sense, besides adding the decision of balancing getting a good power plant  for cheap vs. building up to your capacity now. It makes sense that uou may not fire power plants at certain times if you generate too much, and that your profits are variable based on your city count and not solely dependent on which plants you fire. In the card game, the direct conversion of resources to money abstracts the power plants to be economic investments to convert money you spend (for resources) into larger quantities of money, hence the stock holding feel.

Second, the solely "stock holding" nature of this game means there has to be a wonkier resource market to create the speculation aspect of the stocks. This market is both less thematic (because there could be only one resource left of a type but it could be shifted down to the cheapest column) and less elegant than that in the board game.

Thirdly, there feels like there is less of a progression arc in the card game. In the board game, resources are generally plentiful early on but get scarce later, the start of the game often involves carving out a territory that only you can access cheaply only for it to feel crowded soon afterwards, and there are very distinct changes when each step activates. In the card game, the restock rate changes by shuffling in cards into the resource deck, but otherwise there isn't much change from round to round besides the fact that the money you will be passing around will gradually get larger.

Fourthly, I liked how the end game condition in the board game wasn't tied to the power plant deck. While generally the game rarely lasted more than a couple rounds after the step 3 cards was drawn anyways, besides building to a certain threshold being more thematic, I liked how you could try to risk having say 15 capacity in a 4 player game and rushing to end the game before anyone else can build more than 16, or you can try to slow the game down enough that people require 3 high end power plants to have a chance to win. In other words, the different end game condition lead to different end game states.

Fifthly, and kind of tied to how in the board game you can win with different amounts of capacity, I liked the capacity wars in the board game. The card game waters this down further by having money left over converting to end game points, meaning it is very clear that you should never pay more than $10 (including different fuel costs) for each additional capacity on the last round. In the board game especially when playing with hidden money, the huge importance on capacity means that I have seen people bid power plants to over $100 for that 7 capacity plant over that 6 capacity one. I will concede that having less swingy valuations of power plants means the card game is probably nicer to new players.

Sixthly, I dislike how turn order is now tied to how much money you owed rather than the number of cities you have. I do think that people who think the turn order holds the "winning" player back too much will like it better here, as it seems less important to get a key power plant (devaluing turn order), and you can possibly go for an efficient but low income strategy to not be high in turn order yet still be winning. However, I liked how in the board game the turn order was something to be manipulated. Whilst in the card game you can make a simple decision to not fire a power plant (with more obvious returns for doing so), in the board game you can try to build in spurts to jump ahead and then fall behind in turn order, at the expense of possibly getting blocked off on the map. You could also circumnavigate the turn order issue by having a high capacity power plant (and therefore having high profits and being teed up for the win while being lower in turn order do to not having many cities). 
 
Things I do think the board game is inferior on are on a cheap map the renewable plants feel fairly weak (whereas here due to not having the variable nature of a map all the power plants seem to always have some viability), and the end game in the board game can either get bogged down by AP, or have a guaranteed winner before the last round is over.

Overall though, I might still pick up the card game at some point due to it being one of the few non-party games that plays well with 5-6, and despite all of the things it falls shorts compared to its predecessor I still thought it was an enjoyable game.

There are card game adaptations and then there are card game adaptations.  For example, San Juan adapts Puerto Rico by conveying just enough of the mechanics but still making it a full card game.  Power Grid: The Card Game doesn't play like a card game.  It plays like the board game, but without the map.  Since you don't have the board but you have almost all of the same mechanics expressed through cards, it comes across as too fiddly not very rewarding.  There's nothing from the experience that you can't also get from the board game.  However, the lack of map really helps emphasize how much of the clever game play of the board game came from the map; the card game just feels lacking and weak without it.

lighter version of PW. Focuses on power plant and resource phases only, with no map. It works better with 2 or lower player counts than original, and has benefit of taking less than an hour to play. The discount token is an interesting approach to make the market flow faster and almost forcing people to purchase power plants. Nevertheless, the game comes down too light. For the time it takes to play I rather play other filler games. It does serve also as a good introduction for power grid for new players.

A short version of Power Grid. You miss the boardplay of course. Instead of working toward the required number of houses that you need to service, here you have to be thinking about the margin you will score on your powerplants, while also estimating how many turns the game will still last. Not a bad effort but I would always prefer PG, the real thing.

This really gives the feel of Power Grid in a lighter package. I've mostly been playing it with my wife for those times when I really want to play Power Grid, but it's just the two of us. Pulling out the map, and the lighter set-up really make this a better 2-player experience than the original.

Like the original it really does seem to do better at 4 though. I've had good luck teaching it both to people who knew the board game and people who were brand new to the series. Although, this is one that definitely benefits from a teacher who knows what parts to present and what parts to glaze over on the initial pass.

The major con, from my point of view, is that, for a lighter, faster, stripped down version of Power Grid, the rules maintain all the fiddliness of the original. In fact if all you know is the very original Power Grid, as opposed to the deluxe version, the rule complexity has increased in some ways. It's honestly a bit more than a game of this weight would normally be able to carry, but it's offset by the fact that only one or two people in a group need to understand every nuance, and that understanding is pretty easy to pick up if you know Power Grid the board game.

X-Mas gift for 2016.  Power Grid without being Power Grid.  It distills the experience down to the auction and the resource buys.  Certainly a little faster than regular PG but I like playing with the maps.   Its OK, but I enjoy the boardgame more.

I have always been torn by Power Grid.  For most of the game, I am loving it.  The bids are exciting, the connectiong of plants, the gathering of resources.  This game is almost the same, just no map.  Everything is going great.  And then, comes the endgame where it falls with a colossal 'thud'.  It is hard to pin on what does not work for me.  Perhaps it is the complete possibility of calculating exactly how much everyone will be making and will score.  The final scores of this game were so close, yet at the same time, the whole last turn was predictable.  Why in the world do they not allow overbuys and storage at game end?  It would be so much better if the end game card ended the game immediately...no final scoring, just score what you have NOW.  This would probably make all the difference.  As it is, that nagging feeling stays.

No longer interested after seeing Sam Healey's video review. It is Power Grid without the map and using a slightly more complicated resource market with cards that represent up to three resources. Without the race for cities and the fear of missing out on the map this seems incomplete. The abstraction of power plants that with hardwired payoff is not appealing for me.

A dreadful bastardization of a classic game that sucks out all of the fun and tension. It's not just the removal of the map and level of separation between capacity and profitability, but the contrast in power plant level is so low as to remove tension from the auction. In our play we had multiple consecutive rounds with zero bids because there was so little compelling offerings. Dull and repetitive.

A bit disappointed with this on the first play. Maybe it's just Power Grid I don't like. It's decent, but there seems to be too many unintuitive rules that need to be memorized (special first round conditions, special last round conditions, etc.). I'm not so sure the power plants are balanced, either. I've never enjoyed those rotating cards as counters either (Catan Card Game also uses them).

[b]Power Grid: The Card Game[/b] was sold via auction 3/25/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Power Grid: TCG was a surprise hit this month and I can't wait to play again. I was hesitant to buy the game and reading through the rulebook didn't inspire much confidence. The rules make the game seem much more complex than it is, although there is a lot of maintenance between rounds similar to Power Grid. This is not a streamlined card game version of it's big brother.

PG:TCG eliminates the board and completely focuses on the power plant auction, and resource market. You still fire up your power plants for money, but at the end of the game you get points instead of cash and cash is a 10 to 1 point ratio which is actually a nice change. Hoarding money doesn't pay off in this version so auctions tend to be quite competitive. 

All in all I really like what PG:TCG brings to the table, it still offers a deep play experience while cutting the game time in half. I still think Power Grid is the better game, I love the map/city competition, but I think the card game will be easier to get to the table and will make a great opener since you'll still have time for a longer game on a typical game night. I also think this will appeal to folks who found PG to be too mathy, that is cut way down in the card game.[/i]

I'm not overly a fan. Whilst always enjoyable, I'm not blind to the fact that Power Grid is flawed as, with experienced players, the end result is often the result of a chicken auction - do I bid this higher (in case the next card is crap) or do I bail out (because the next card is even better) - and it's all a guess. This card game beautifully captures this same flaw (*sigh*), and does away with the feature that makes the board game palatable, being the ebb and flow of board position and site purchase. Meaning the essence of the card game is distilled to auction after auction after auction, which is probably our least liked aspect of the board game. Given it also brings nothing new to the table, there's no desire to explore further.

"Small quick card game that captures the flavor of Power Grid, minus the board. The auctions and resource market aren't that competitive, and therefore that the decisions aren't as weighty as I had hoped. I need to play more to know, however. Runs the risk of becoming a 7 and hitting the trade pile."

What I like:
- Small box, low price
- The power plants were my favorite part of PG, and they're great here
- The "trust" variant seems to work really well for 2 players
- Plays in under an hour, at least at lower player counts

What I don't like:
- The rules for updating the markets are convoluted
- I don't hate paper money like some people, but it's not great
- I'm not sure how meaningful the decisions are--there are a lot of ways you can end with about 24-28 points

A good learning game variant is to just buy the plant you want for the minimum price, rather than putting it up for auction. Personally, I rarely see a reason to bid someone up at all, and when I do it's not by much. It would be interesting to play against someone who bid aggressively. 

The game seems very balanced. Even failing to have a plant produce in one round (other than the final round) isn't catastrophic, because your marginal profit from power production is just a few bucks.

One of my fellow players preferred this version above the actual boardgame as you don't have to calculate interconnection costs anymore (which is logic as there ain't a board :-)), but that's one of the fun parts for me.

The card game version keeps a LOT of the flavor of its big brother(s) while greatly simplifying things and speeding play:
- no cities to track (earn and compare income itself)
- no board to ponder over your network geography
- costs all reduced (smaller numbers to deal with for the math-averse)
- no wooden resource bits to fiddle with (use cards like in Settlers Card Game)
- clever, simple game timer (3rd Stage --> 1 More Round) and resource timer (every shuffle through the deck adds some resources; as you play, the less-efficient resources naturally shift to lower costs)

I like the expansion map twists of the base game but would definitely play this card version, as sort of a filler, again!

I have not played Power Grid, so I don't know if any essential game play factors have been stripped out to create this relatively simple auction game.  As a two-player game, we had a Trust that did not use money, meddled in the markets according to fairly simple rules, and had reasonably low maintenance.  However, the rules did not make it clear if there was any criteria for the Trust to select which of its power plants to keep when it reached the limit of three, so we assumed it would keep the highest numbered plants.

It seemed to me that a good strategy was to get the green plants early, as they had no requirement to purchase fuel.  However, due to the scoring where currency earned earlier in the game is only worth 1/10 of that earned in the final round, it makes the game more interesting in trying to determine the opportunity cost of buying a plant that will produce more power in the final round.

I really dig Power Grid and Factory Manager but have a really hard time getting them to the table with my game group because of the play time. I'm hoping this one will be able to scratch that itch. I'm also intrigued by the ability to play 2 player since I play a lot of 2 player games with my wife :)

In thinking about Power Grid it's pretty clear that the board play, while important in the details, is much less interesting than the central problem of managing the interrelated problems of turn order, power plant auction and resource acquisition. A card game version that removes the board should be fine, right?

It's quite a different beast. In particular, it's important to know going in that the power plant spread is very narrow (the final plants have a base cost of 9 or 10, vs Power Grid's 50) and cash contributes directly to points, rather than being a tiebreaker, so profitability is more important than maximizing growth. 

There is also much more potential for manipulating the resource market, because all fuel types occupy the same pricing grid. If no-one buys, say, natural gas, the market will fill up with it at the expense of other fuel types.

Unfortunately it all feels a little bit limp and unexciting -- a far cry from the white-knuckle race of its big-brother. Partly that's just because of the economy: a cheap 7 is better than an expensive 8 and it's very possible that the marginal cost of upgrading is not actually worth it. It's functional and competent but not very interesting.

We're always looking for good games for 5-6 players and have been delighted to add this excellent reduction of the Power Grid system to our playlist.  No maps!  But all the fun (if that's the right word) of the power plant auctions and a new kind of volatility in the fuels market.

Like this a lot - it neatly runs like the boardgame, but without the burden of trying to figure out at the auction phase if you are going to have enough money in the building phase. It is still a game that hinges on the final round though.

Whereas Castles of Burgundy: The Card game simplifies and streamlines the game, this takes something elegant and complicates it.  Yes, you get a bit of the Power Grid vibe in like an hour.  That part is true.

You don`t have to count so much, because you have only power plants and resources, but no houses. On the other hand in Power Grid you can play some rounds without counting so much and just trust your feelings. In the carfd game you must count in every round.

The game is fast. I like that you buy very much power plants. The game is more dynamic.

You bid not so much as in PG. 

I1m not sure about the market. In PG you know exacly how many resources will come. Here it`s a suprise. Especially uranium, there`re only few cards in the game. So in some round you could have no uranium in play.

I don`t see high replaybility. Every game seems to be just like the first one.

Nice game, I could play from time to time. This game is in the matter of Roll for the Galaxy (For sure inspired by the board game, has the feeling of the big brother, but is also something new). When i want to play a fast game of Power Grid I would ratter choose the Benelux Map.

The rules really need a re-write, and overall clarification of the game ending conditions. 

Also, it's not clear why the designer introduced a victory point conversion during the end-game scoring, when it seemed very straightforward in Power Grid by having the player with the most money be the winner.

First play impression: It really feels like Power Grid but in a much shorter time frame.

However, the rulebook is pretty bad and there are a number of fiddly little rules and exceptions. The setup is also fairly fiddly because you have to shuffle different cards together based on the player count, set up the resource market differently based on player count, rotate cards to a certain orientation, set aside the single-resource cards, and there are two separate discard piles.

Besides all of that, the game does seem promising though. It was fun and really tight. The final scores were all tied in my four-player game so it came down to who had the most money leftover.

Will rate after more plays.

Nowhere near as good as the board game but it does a good job of condensing some mechanics down and offering a shorter version.

Captures most of the meat of PowerGrid, but takes about 1/3 the time. I definitely prefer this one over the board game.

1 play: Sort of meh. Very functional, and I like the bidding and market tension, but it felt like it was sort of lacking. The correct move seems somewhat obvious, or at least like there isn't much difference between 2 different moves. I mainly disliked the end-game scoring of running your final factories once. Seemed underwhelming. It was OK, but not something I'd pursue. (6 players)

It's OK. The auction element is very similar to the board game so fun in that regards. But the resource market is simply not brutal enough to make it very challenging. Also our group figured out the winning strategy pretty quickly within a couple of games which leads to a boring mid-game of minimal action then a strong last 2 rounds and the winner is dictated by how lucky you get (what plants come out when it's your turn to start the bid). It's losing it's replay-ability because of that.

mixed feelings here.
I love power grid and the card game version is a very good tense game.
On the other hand, as a card game, it needs too much setup, too much space and complicated handling throughout the game. Probably this feeling will go away after a few games.

Reimplementation focusing on the commodity market and power plant auctions. I appreciate the rotating energy cards to track resource levels and I don't miss chasing the oil cylinders all over the floor.  The auction and future auction function much the same. But for me it isn't enough to overlook the missing route building area control tension and the supply-demand mechanic of the original commodity market.

Never played [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid]any[/url] [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/106662/power-grid-first-sparks]form[/url] of Power Grid?  Good luck.

Friedemann Friese games are notorious for having awful rulebooks - without exception. Every obfuscatory ingredient is there: start with an odd and complicated game, then toss in translation issues and an inability to organize and communicate clearly.

So... about this particular design. If you're a Power Grid novice and can get someone else to teach you - someone who truly knows the rules - you should be OK.

But if you're a diehard PG fan, you'll probably get emotional about the pieces of the original that have been stripped away.  Even skeletal remains can be attractive, though.  Particularly if they're hippy.

It is what it says - power grid without the board. All the fun of the power plant market and fuel market, no worries about substations, and plays quite a bit faster. I really like the way the fuel market works, the uncertainty is maybe even more fun than the original(!!!), but I really like the board so when I have time I'd prefer to play the original game.

I love the board game, but have mixed feelings about this game.  The fuel cards swing widely from turn to turn making it hard to predict what will be in short supply the next turn.  The card game skips the whole area control part (connecting cities) of the board game, which was my favorite part.  Still, the card game manages to capture much of the feel and is still fun to play, even if the experience is nowhere as good.
